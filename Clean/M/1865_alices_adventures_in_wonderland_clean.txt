 ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND CHAPTER I. Down Rabbit-Hole Alice beginning get tired sitting sister bank, nothing do: twice peeped book sister reading, pictures conversations it, “and use book,” thought Alice “without pictures conversations?” So considering mind (as well could, hot day made feel sleepy stupid), whether pleasure making daisy-chain would worth trouble getting picking daisies, suddenly White Rabbit pink eyes ran close her. There nothing _very_ remarkable that; Alice think _very_ much way hear Rabbit say itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall late!” (when thought afterwards, occurred ought wondered this, time seemed quite natural); Rabbit actually _took watch waistcoat-pocket_, looked it, hurried on, Alice started feet, flashed across mind never seen rabbit either waistcoat-pocket, watch take it, burning curiosity, ran across field it, fortunately time see pop large rabbit-hole hedge. In another moment went Alice it, never considering world get again. The rabbit-hole went straight like tunnel way, dipped suddenly down, suddenly Alice moment think stopping found falling deep well. Either well deep, fell slowly, plenty time went look wonder going happen next. First, tried look make coming to, dark see anything; looked sides well, noticed filled cupboards book-shelves; saw maps pictures hung upon pegs. She took jar one shelves passed; labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, great disappointment empty: like drop jar fear killing somebody underneath, managed put one cupboards fell past it. “Well!” thought Alice herself, “after fall this, I shall think nothing tumbling stairs! How brave think home! Why, I would say anything it, even I fell top house!” (Which likely true.) Down, down, down. Would fall _never_ come end? “I wonder many miles I fallen time?” said aloud. “I must getting somewhere near centre earth. Let see: would four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, see, Alice learnt several things sort lessons schoolroom, though _very_ good opportunity showing knowledge, one listen her, still good practice say over) “—yes, right distance—but I wonder Latitude Longitude I got to?” (Alice idea Latitude was, Longitude either, thought nice grand words say.) Presently began again. “I wonder I shall fall right _through_ earth! How funny seem come among people walk heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she rather glad _was_ one listening, time, sound right word) “—but I shall ask name country is, know. Please, Madam, New Zealand Australia?” (and tried curtsey spoke—fancy _curtseying_ falling air! Do think could manage it?) “And ignorant little girl think asking! No, never ask: perhaps I shall see written somewhere.” Down, down, down. There nothing else do, Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss much to-night, I think!” (Dinah cat.) “I hope remember saucer milk tea-time. Dinah dear! I wish me! There mice air, I afraid, might catch bat, like mouse, know. But cats eat bats, I wonder?” And Alice began get rather sleepy, went saying herself, dreamy sort way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, see, could answer either question, much matter way put it. She felt dozing off, begun dream walking hand hand Dinah, saying earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell truth: ever eat bat?” suddenly, thump! thump! came upon heap sticks dry leaves, fall over. Alice bit hurt, jumped feet moment: looked up, dark overhead; another long passage, White Rabbit still sight, hurrying it. There moment lost: away went Alice like wind, time hear say, turned corner, “Oh ears whiskers, late getting!” She close behind turned corner, Rabbit longer seen: found long, low hall, lit row lamps hanging roof. There doors round hall, locked; Alice way one side other, trying every door, walked sadly middle, wondering ever get again. Suddenly came upon little three-legged table, made solid glass; nothing except tiny golden key, Alice’s first thought might belong one doors hall; but, alas! either locks large, key small, rate would open them. However, second time round, came upon low curtain noticed before, behind little door fifteen inches high: tried little golden key lock, great delight fitted! Alice opened door found led small passage, much larger rat-hole: knelt looked along passage loveliest garden ever saw. How longed get dark hall, wander among beds bright flowers cool fountains, could even get head doorway; “and even head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would little use without shoulders. Oh, I wish I could shut like telescope! I think I could, I knew begin.” For, see, many out-of-the-way things happened lately, Alice begun think things indeed really impossible. There seemed use waiting little door, went back table, half hoping might find another key it, rate book rules shutting people like telescopes: time found little bottle it, (“which certainly before,” said Alice,) round neck bottle paper label, words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed large letters. It well say “Drink me,” wise little Alice going _that_ hurry. “No, I look first,” said, “and see whether marked ‘_poison_’ not”; read several nice little histories children got burnt, eaten wild beasts unpleasant things, _would_ remember simple rules friends taught them: as, red-hot poker burn hold long; cut finger _very_ deeply knife, usually bleeds; never forgotten that, drink much bottle marked “poison,” almost certain disagree you, sooner later. However, bottle _not_ marked “poison,” Alice ventured taste it, finding nice, (it had, fact, sort mixed flavour cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, hot buttered toast,) soon finished off. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * “What curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must shutting like telescope.” And indeed: ten inches high, face brightened thought right size going little door lovely garden. First, however, waited minutes see going shrink further: felt little nervous this; “for might end, know,” said Alice herself, “in going altogether, like candle. I wonder I like then?” And tried fancy flame candle like candle blown out, could remember ever seen thing. After while, finding nothing happened, decided going garden once; but, alas poor Alice! got door, found forgotten little golden key, went back table it, found could possibly reach it: could see quite plainly glass, tried best climb one legs table, slippery; tired trying, poor little thing sat cried. “Come, use crying like that!” said Alice herself, rather sharply; “I advise leave minute!” She generally gave good advice, (though seldom followed it), sometimes scolded severely bring tears eyes; remembered trying box ears cheated game croquet playing herself, curious child fond pretending two people. “But use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend two people! Why, hardly enough left make _one_ respectable person!” Soon eye fell little glass box lying table: opened it, found small cake, words “EAT ME” beautifully marked currants. “Well, I eat it,” said Alice, “and makes grow larger, I reach key; makes grow smaller, I creep door; either way I get garden, I care happens!” She ate little bit, said anxiously herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding hand top head feel way growing, quite surprised find remained size: sure, generally happens one eats cake, Alice got much way expecting nothing out-of-the-way things happen, seemed quite dull stupid life go common way. So set work, soon finished cake. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II. The Pool Tears “Curiouser curiouser!” cried Alice (she much surprised, moment quite forgot speak good English); “now I opening like largest telescope ever was! Good-bye, feet!” (for looked feet, seemed almost sight, getting far off). “Oh, poor little feet, I wonder put shoes stockings now, dears? I sure _I_ shall able! I shall great deal far trouble you: must manage best way can;—but I must kind them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps walk way I want go! Let see: I give new pair boots every Christmas.” And went planning would manage it. “They must go carrier,” thought; “and funny seem, sending presents one’s feet! And odd directions look! _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near Fender,_ (_with Alice’s love_). Oh dear, nonsense I talking!” Just head struck roof hall: fact nine feet high, took little golden key hurried garden door. Poor Alice! It much could do, lying one side, look garden one eye; get hopeless ever: sat began cry again. “You ought ashamed yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like you,” (she might well say this), “to go crying way! Stop moment, I tell you!” But went same, shedding gallons tears, large pool round her, four inches deep reaching half hall. After time heard little pattering feet distance, hastily dried eyes see coming. It White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, pair white kid gloves one hand large fan other: came trotting along great hurry, muttering came, “Oh! Duchess, Duchess! Oh! savage I kept waiting!” Alice felt desperate ready ask help one; so, Rabbit came near her, began, low, timid voice, “If please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped white kid gloves fan, skurried away darkness hard could go. Alice took fan gloves, and, hall hot, kept fanning time went talking: “Dear, dear! How queer everything to-day! And yesterday things went usual. I wonder I changed night? Let think: I I got morning? I almost think I remember feeling little different. But I same, next question is, Who world I? Ah, _that’s_ great puzzle!” And began thinking children knew age herself, see could changed them. “I sure I Ada,” said, “for hair goes long ringlets, mine go ringlets all; I sure I cannot Mabel, I know sorts things, she, oh! knows little! Besides, _she’s_ she, _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, puzzling is! I try I know things I used know. Let see: four times five twelve, four times six thirteen, four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get twenty rate! However, Multiplication Table signify: let us try Geography. London capital Paris, Paris capital Rome, Rome—no, _that’s_ wrong, I certain! I must changed Mabel! I try say ‘_How doth little_—’” crossed hands lap saying lessons, began repeat it, voice sounded hoarse strange, words come used do:— “How doth little crocodile Improve shining tail, And pour waters Nile On every golden scale! “How cheerfully seems grin, How neatly spread claws, And welcome little fishes With gently smiling jaws!” “I sure right words,” said poor Alice, eyes filled tears went on, “I must Mabel all, I shall go live poky little house, next toys play with, oh! ever many lessons learn! No, I made mind it; I Mabel, I stay here! It use putting heads saying ‘Come again, dear!’ I shall look say ‘Who I then? Tell first, then, I like person, I come up: not, I stay till I somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, sudden burst tears, “I wish _would_ put heads down! I _very_ tired alone here!” As said looked hands, surprised see put one Rabbit’s little white kid gloves talking. “How _can_ I done that?” thought. “I must growing small again.” She got went table measure it, found that, nearly could guess, two feet high, going shrinking rapidly: soon found fan holding, dropped hastily, time avoid shrinking away altogether. “That _was_ narrow escape!” said Alice, good deal frightened sudden change, glad find still existence; “and garden!” ran speed back little door: but, alas! little door shut again, little golden key lying glass table before, “and things worse ever,” thought poor child, “for I never small before, never! And I declare bad, is!” As said words foot slipped, another moment, splash! chin salt water. Her first idea somehow fallen sea, “and case I go back railway,” said herself. (Alice seaside life, come general conclusion, wherever go English coast find number bathing machines sea, children digging sand wooden spades, row lodging houses, behind railway station.) However, soon made pool tears wept nine feet high. “I wish I cried much!” said Alice, swam about, trying find way out. “I shall punished now, I suppose, drowned tears! That _will_ queer thing, sure! However, everything queer to-day.” Just heard something splashing pool little way off, swam nearer make was: first thought must walrus hippopotamus, remembered small now, soon made mouse slipped like herself. “Would use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak mouse? Everything out-of-the-way here, I think likely talk: rate, harm trying.” So began: “O Mouse, know way pool? I tired swimming here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought must right way speaking mouse: never done thing before, remembered seen brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of mouse—to mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked rather inquisitively, seemed wink one little eyes, said nothing. “Perhaps understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay French mouse, come William Conqueror.” (For, knowledge history, Alice clear notion long ago anything happened.) So began again: “Où est chatte?” first sentence French lesson-book. The Mouse gave sudden leap water, seemed quiver fright. “Oh, I beg pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid hurt poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot like cats.” “Not like cats!” cried Mouse, shrill, passionate voice. “Would _you_ like cats me?” “Well, perhaps not,” said Alice soothing tone: “do angry it. And yet I wish I could show cat Dinah: I think would take fancy cats could see her. She dear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half herself, swam lazily pool, “and sits purring nicely fire, licking paws washing face—and nice soft thing nurse—and capital one catching mice—oh, I beg pardon!” cried Alice again, time Mouse bristling over, felt certain must really offended. “We talk would rather not.” “We indeed!” cried Mouse, trembling end tail. “As _I_ would talk subject! Our family always _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Do let hear name again!” “I indeed!” said Alice, great hurry change subject conversation. “Are you—are fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse answer, Alice went eagerly: “There nice little dog near house I like show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, know, oh, long curly brown hair! And fetch things throw them, sit beg dinner, sorts things—I cannot remember half them—and belongs farmer, know, says useful, worth hundred pounds! He says kills rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice sorrowful tone, “I afraid I offended again!” For Mouse swimming away hard could go, making quite commotion pool went. So called softly it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, talk cats dogs either, like them!” When Mouse heard this, turned round swam slowly back her: face quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), said low trembling voice, “Let us get shore, I tell history, understand I hate cats dogs.” It high time go, pool getting quite crowded birds animals fallen it: Duck Dodo, Lory Eaglet, several curious creatures. Alice led way, whole party swam shore. CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race Long Tale They indeed queer-looking party assembled bank—the birds draggled feathers, animals fur clinging close them, dripping wet, cross, uncomfortable. The first question course was, get dry again: consultation this, minutes seemed quite natural Alice find talking familiarly them, known life. Indeed, quite long argument Lory, last turned sulky, would say, “I older you, must know better;” Alice would allow without knowing old was, and, Lory positively refused tell age, said. At last Mouse, seemed person authority among them, called out, “Sit down, you, listen me! _I’ll_ soon make dry enough!” They sat once, large ring, Mouse middle. Alice kept eyes anxiously fixed it, felt sure would catch bad cold get dry soon. “Ahem!” said Mouse important air, “are ready? This driest thing I know. Silence round, please! ‘William Conqueror, whose favoured pope, soon submitted English, wanted leaders, late much accustomed usurpation conquest. Edwin Morcar, earls Mercia Northumbria—’” “Ugh!” said Lory, shiver. “I beg pardon!” said Mouse, frowning, politely: “Did speak?” “Not I!” said Lory hastily. “I thought did,” said Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin Morcar, earls Mercia Northumbria, declared him: even Stigand, patriotic archbishop Canterbury, found advisable—’” “Found _what_?” said Duck. “Found _it_,” Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course know ‘it’ means.” “I know ‘it’ means well enough, _I_ find thing,” said Duck: “it generally frog worm. The question is, archbishop find?” The Mouse notice question, hurriedly went on, “‘—found advisable go Edgar Atheling meet William offer crown. William’s conduct first moderate. But insolence Normans—’ How getting now, dear?” continued, turning Alice spoke. “As wet ever,” said Alice melancholy tone: “it seem dry all.” “In case,” said Dodo solemnly, rising feet, “I move meeting adjourn, immediate adoption energetic remedies—” “Speak English!” said Eaglet. “I know meaning half long words, and, more, I believe either!” And Eaglet bent head hide smile: birds tittered audibly. “What I going say,” said Dodo offended tone, “was, best thing get us dry would Caucus-race.” “What _is_ Caucus-race?” said Alice; wanted much know, Dodo paused thought _somebody_ ought speak, one else seemed inclined say anything. “Why,” said Dodo, “the best way explain it.” (And, might like try thing yourself, winter day, I tell Dodo managed it.) First marked race-course, sort circle, (“the exact shape matter,” said,) party placed along course, there. There “One, two, three, away,” began running liked, left liked, easy know race over. However, running half hour so, quite dry again, Dodo suddenly called “The race over!” crowded round it, panting, asking, “But won?” This question Dodo could answer without great deal thought, sat long time one finger pressed upon forehead (the position usually see Shakespeare, pictures him), rest waited silence. At last Dodo said, “_Everybody_ won, must prizes.” “But give prizes?” quite chorus voices asked. “Why, _she_, course,” said Dodo, pointing Alice one finger; whole party crowded round her, calling confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!” Alice idea do, despair put hand pocket, pulled box comfits, (luckily salt water got it), handed round prizes. There exactly one a-piece, round. “But must prize herself, know,” said Mouse. “Of course,” Dodo replied gravely. “What else got pocket?” went on, turning Alice. “Only thimble,” said Alice sadly. “Hand here,” said Dodo. Then crowded round more, Dodo solemnly presented thimble, saying “We beg acceptance elegant thimble;” and, finished short speech, cheered. Alice thought whole thing absurd, looked grave dare laugh; and, could think anything say, simply bowed, took thimble, looking solemn could. The next thing eat comfits: caused noise confusion, large birds complained could taste theirs, small ones choked patted back. However, last, sat ring, begged Mouse tell something more. “You promised tell history, know,” said Alice, “and hate—C D,” added whisper, half afraid would offended again. “Mine long sad tale!” said Mouse, turning Alice, sighing. “It _is_ long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking wonder Mouse’s tail; “but call sad?” And kept puzzling Mouse speaking, idea tale something like this:— “Fury said mouse, That met house, ‘Let us go law: _I_ prosecute _you_.—Come, I take denial; We must trial: For really morning I nothing do.’ Said mouse cur, ‘Such trial, dear sir, With jury judge, would wasting breath.’ ‘I judge, I jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I try whole because, condemn death.’” “You attending!” said Mouse Alice severely. “What thinking of?” “I beg pardon,” said Alice humbly: “you got fifth bend, I think?” “I _not!_” cried Mouse, sharply angrily. “A knot!” said Alice, always ready make useful, looking anxiously her. “Oh, let help undo it!” “I shall nothing sort,” said Mouse, getting walking away. “You insult talking nonsense!” “I mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But easily offended, know!” The Mouse growled reply. “Please come back finish story!” Alice called it; others joined chorus, “Yes, please do!” Mouse shook head impatiently, walked little quicker. “What pity would stay!” sighed Lory, soon quite sight; old Crab took opportunity saying daughter “Ah, dear! Let lesson never lose _your_ temper!” “Hold tongue, Ma!” said young Crab, little snappishly. “You enough try patience oyster!” “I wish I Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud, addressing nobody particular. “She would soon fetch back!” “And Dinah, I might venture ask question?” said Lory. Alice replied eagerly, always ready talk pet: “Dinah’s cat. And capital one catching mice cannot think! And oh, I wish could see birds! Why, eat little bird soon look it!” This speech caused remarkable sensation among party. Some birds hurried once: one old Magpie began wrapping carefully, remarking, “I really must getting home; night-air suit throat!” Canary called trembling voice children, “Come away, dears! It high time bed!” On various pretexts moved off, Alice soon left alone. “I wish I mentioned Dinah!” said melancholy tone. “Nobody seems like her, here, I sure best cat world! Oh, dear Dinah! I wonder I shall ever see more!” And poor Alice began cry again, felt lonely low-spirited. In little while, however, heard little pattering footsteps distance, looked eagerly, half hoping Mouse changed mind, coming back finish story. CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends Little Bill It White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, looking anxiously went, lost something; heard muttering “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh dear paws! Oh fur whiskers! She get executed, sure ferrets ferrets! Where _can_ I dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed moment looking fan pair white kid gloves, good-naturedly began hunting them, nowhere seen—everything seemed changed since swim pool, great hall, glass table little door, vanished completely. Very soon Rabbit noticed Alice, went hunting about, called angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, _are_ here? Run home moment, fetch pair gloves fan! Quick, now!” And Alice much frightened ran direction pointed to, without trying explain mistake made. “He took housemaid,” said ran. “How surprised finds I am! But I would better take fan gloves—that is, I find them.” As said this, came upon neat little house, door bright brass plate name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went without knocking, hurried upstairs, great fear lest meet real Mary Ann, turned house found fan gloves. “How queer seems,” Alice said herself, “to going messages rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll sending messages next!” And began fancying sort thing would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come directly, get ready walk!’ ‘Coming minute, nurse! But I got see mouse get out.’ Only I think,” Alice went on, “that would let Dinah stop house began ordering people like that!” By time found way tidy little room table window, (as hoped) fan two three pairs tiny white kid gloves: took fan pair gloves, going leave room, eye fell upon little bottle stood near looking-glass. There label time words “DRINK ME,” nevertheless uncorked put lips. “I know _something_ interesting sure happen,” said herself, “whenever I eat drink anything; I see bottle does. I hope make grow large again, really I quite tired tiny little thing!” It indeed, much sooner expected: drunk half bottle, found head pressing ceiling, stoop save neck broken. She hastily put bottle, saying “That quite enough—I hope I shall grow more—As is, I cannot get door—I wish I drunk quite much!” Alas! late wish that! She went growing, growing, soon kneel floor: another minute even room this, tried effect lying one elbow door, arm curled round head. Still went growing, and, last resource, put one arm window, one foot chimney, said “Now I more, whatever happens. What _will_ become me?” Luckily Alice, little magic bottle full effect, grew larger: still uncomfortable, and, seemed sort chance ever getting room again, wonder felt unhappy. “It much pleasanter home,” thought poor Alice, “when one always growing larger smaller, ordered mice rabbits. I almost wish I gone rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it rather curious, know, sort life! I wonder _can_ happened me! When I used read fairy-tales, I fancied kind thing never happened, I middle one! There ought book written me, ought! And I grow up, I write one—but I grown now,” added sorrowful tone; “at least room grow _here_.” “But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get older I now? That comfort, one way—never old woman—but then—always lessons learn! Oh, I like _that!_” “Oh, foolish Alice!” answered herself. “How learn lessons here? Why, hardly room _you_, room lesson-books!” And went on, taking first one side other, making quite conversation altogether; minutes heard voice outside, stopped listen. “Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said voice. “Fetch gloves moment!” Then came little pattering feet stairs. Alice knew Rabbit coming look her, trembled till shook house, quite forgetting thousand times large Rabbit, reason afraid it. Presently Rabbit came door, tried open it; but, door opened inwards, Alice’s elbow pressed hard it, attempt proved failure. Alice heard say “Then I go round get window.” “_That_ not!” thought Alice, and, waiting till fancied heard Rabbit window, suddenly spread hand, made snatch air. She get hold anything, heard little shriek fall, crash broken glass, concluded possible fallen cucumber-frame, something sort. Next came angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where you?” And voice never heard before, “Sure I here! Digging apples, yer honour!” “Digging apples, indeed!” said Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come help _this!_” (Sounds broken glass.) “Now tell me, Pat, window?” “Sure, arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced “arrum.”) “An arm, goose! Who ever saw one size? Why, fills whole window!” “Sure, does, yer honour: arm that.” “Well, got business there, rate: go take away!” There long silence this, Alice could hear whispers then; as, “Sure, I like it, yer honour, all, all!” “Do I tell you, coward!” last spread hand again, made another snatch air. This time _two_ little shrieks, sounds broken glass. “What number cucumber-frames must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder next! As pulling window, I wish _could!_ I sure _I_ want stay longer!” She waited time without hearing anything more: last came rumbling little cartwheels, sound good many voices talking together: made words: “Where ladder?—Why, I bring one; Bill’s got other—Bill! fetch here, lad!—Here, put corner—No, tie together first—they reach half high enough yet—Oh! well enough; particular—Here, Bill! catch hold rope—Will roof bear?—Mind loose slate—Oh, coming down! Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, that?—It Bill, I fancy—Who go chimney?—Nay, _I_ shall not! _You_ it!—_That_ I not, then!—Bill’s go down—Here, Bill! master says go chimney!” “Oh! So Bill’s got come chimney, he?” said Alice herself. “Shy, seem put everything upon Bill! I would Bill’s place good deal: fireplace narrow, sure; I _think_ I kick little!” She drew foot far chimney could, waited till heard little animal (she could guess sort was) scratching scrambling chimney close her: then, saying “This Bill,” gave one sharp kick, waited see would happen next. The first thing heard general chorus “There goes Bill!” Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, hedge!” silence, another confusion voices—“Hold head—Brandy now—Do choke him—How it, old fellow? What happened you? Tell us it!” Last came little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That Bill,” thought Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I better now—but I deal flustered tell you—all I know is, something comes like Jack-in-the-box, I goes like sky-rocket!” “So did, old fellow!” said others. “We must burn house down!” said Rabbit’s voice; Alice called loud could, “If do, I set Dinah you!” There dead silence instantly, Alice thought herself, “I wonder _will_ next! If sense, would take roof off.” After minute two, began moving again, Alice heard Rabbit say, “A barrowful do, begin with.” “A barrowful _what?_” thought Alice; long doubt, next moment shower little pebbles came rattling window, hit face. “I put stop this,” said herself, shouted out, “You would better again!” produced another dead silence. Alice noticed surprise pebbles turning little cakes lay floor, bright idea came head. “If I eat one cakes,” thought, “it sure make _some_ change size; cannot possibly make larger, must make smaller, I suppose.” So swallowed one cakes, delighted find began shrinking directly. As soon small enough get door, ran house, found quite crowd little animals birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, middle, held two guinea-pigs, giving something bottle. They made rush Alice moment appeared; ran hard could, soon found safe thick wood. “The first thing I got do,” said Alice herself, wandered wood, “is grow right size again; second thing find way lovely garden. I think best plan.” It sounded excellent plan, doubt, neatly simply arranged; difficulty was, smallest idea set it; peering anxiously among trees, little sharp bark head made look great hurry. An enormous puppy looking large round eyes, feebly stretching one paw, trying touch her. “Poor little thing!” said Alice, coaxing tone, tried hard whistle it; terribly frightened time thought might hungry, case would likely eat spite coaxing. Hardly knowing did, picked little bit stick, held puppy; whereupon puppy jumped air feet once, yelp delight, rushed stick, made believe worry it; Alice dodged behind great thistle, keep run over; moment appeared side, puppy made another rush stick, tumbled head heels hurry get hold it; Alice, thinking like game play cart-horse, expecting every moment trampled feet, ran round thistle again; puppy began series short charges stick, running little way forwards time long way back, barking hoarsely while, till last sat good way off, panting, tongue hanging mouth, great eyes half shut. This seemed Alice good opportunity making escape; set once, ran till quite tired breath, till puppy’s bark sounded quite faint distance. “And yet dear little puppy was!” said Alice, leant buttercup rest herself, fanned one leaves: “I liked teaching tricks much, if—if I would right size it! Oh dear! I would nearly forgotten I got grow again! Let see—how _is_ managed? I suppose I ought eat drink something other; great question is, what?” The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked round flowers blades grass, see anything looked like right thing eat drink circumstances. There large mushroom growing near her, height herself; looked it, sides it, behind it, occurred might well look see top it. She stretched tiptoe, peeped edge mushroom, eyes immediately met large blue caterpillar, sitting top arms folded, quietly smoking long hookah, taking smallest notice anything else. CHAPTER V. Advice Caterpillar The Caterpillar Alice looked time silence: last Caterpillar took hookah mouth, addressed languid, sleepy voice. “Who _you?_” said Caterpillar. This encouraging opening conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, present—at least I know I _was_ I got morning, I think I must changed several times since then.” “What mean that?” said Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!” “I cannot explain _myself_, I afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I myself, see.” “I see,” said Caterpillar. “I afraid I cannot put clearly,” Alice replied politely, “for I cannot understand begin with; many different sizes day confusing.” “It not,” said Caterpillar. “Well, perhaps found yet,” said Alice; “but turn chrysalis—you day, know—and butterfly, I think feel little queer, you?” “Not bit,” said Caterpillar. “Well, perhaps feelings may different,” said Alice; “all I know is, would feel queer _me_.” “You!” said Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who _you?_” Which brought back beginning conversation. Alice felt little irritated Caterpillar’s making _very_ short remarks, drew said, gravely, “I think, ought tell _you_ are, first.” “Why?” said Caterpillar. Here another puzzling question; Alice could think good reason, Caterpillar seemed _very_ unpleasant state mind, turned away. “Come back!” Caterpillar called her. “I something important say!” This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned came back again. “Keep temper,” said Caterpillar. “Is all?” said Alice, swallowing anger well could. “No,” said Caterpillar. Alice thought might well wait, nothing else do, perhaps might tell something worth hearing. For minutes puffed away without speaking, last unfolded arms, took hookah mouth again, said, “So think changed, you?” “I afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I cannot remember things I used—and I keep size ten minutes together!” “Cannot remember _what_ things?” said Caterpillar. “Well, I tried say “How doth little busy bee,” came different!” Alice replied melancholy voice. “Repeat, “_You old, Father William_,’” said Caterpillar. Alice folded hands, began:— “You old, Father William,” young man said, “And hair become white; And yet incessantly stand head— Do think, age, right?” “In youth,” Father William replied son, “I feared might injure brain; But, I perfectly sure I none, Why, I again.” “You old,” said youth, “as I mentioned before, And grown uncommonly fat; Yet turned back-somersault door— Pray, reason that?” “In youth,” said sage, shook grey locks, “I kept limbs supple By use ointment—one shilling box— Allow sell couple?” “You old,” said youth, “and jaws weak For anything tougher suet; Yet finished goose, bones beak— Pray, manage it?” “In youth,” said father, “I took law, And argued case wife; And muscular strength, gave jaw, Has lasted rest life.” “You old,” said youth, “one would hardly suppose That eye steady ever; Yet balanced eel end nose— What made awfully clever?” “I answered three questions, enough,” Said father; “do give airs! Do think I listen day stuff? Be off, I kick stairs!” “That said right,” said Caterpillar. “Not _quite_ right, I afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some words got altered.” “It wrong beginning end,” said Caterpillar decidedly, silence minutes. The Caterpillar first speak. “What size want be?” asked. “Oh, I particular size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one like changing often, know.” “I _don’t_ know,” said Caterpillar. Alice said nothing: never much contradicted life before, felt losing temper. “Are content now?” said Caterpillar. “Well, I like _little_ larger, sir, would mind,” said Alice: “three inches wretched height be.” “It good height indeed!” said Caterpillar angrily, rearing upright spoke (it exactly three inches high). “But I used it!” pleaded poor Alice piteous tone. And thought herself, “I wish creatures would easily offended!” “You get used time,” said Caterpillar; put hookah mouth began smoking again. This time Alice waited patiently chose speak again. In minute two Caterpillar took hookah mouth yawned twice, shook itself. Then got mushroom, crawled away grass, merely remarking went, “One side make grow taller, side make grow shorter.” “One side _what?_ The side _what?_” thought Alice herself. “Of mushroom,” said Caterpillar, asked aloud; another moment sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully mushroom minute, trying make two sides it; perfectly round, found difficult question. However, last stretched arms round far would go, broke bit edge hand. “And which?” said herself, nibbled little right-hand bit try effect: next moment felt violent blow underneath chin: struck foot! She good deal frightened sudden change, felt time lost, shrinking rapidly; set work eat bit. Her chin pressed closely foot, hardly room open mouth; last, managed swallow morsel lefthand bit. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * “Come, head’s free last!” said Alice tone delight, changed alarm another moment, found shoulders nowhere found: could see, looked down, immense length neck, seemed rise like stalk sea green leaves lay far her. “What _can_ green stuff be?” said Alice. “And _have_ shoulders got to? And oh, poor hands, I cannot see you?” She moving spoke, result seemed follow, except little shaking among distant green leaves. As seemed chance getting hands head, tried get head them, delighted find neck would bend easily direction, like serpent. She succeeded curving graceful zigzag, going dive among leaves, found nothing tops trees wandering, sharp hiss made draw back hurry: large pigeon flown face, beating violently wings. “Serpent!” screamed Pigeon. “I _not_ serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let alone!” “Serpent, I say again!” repeated Pigeon, subdued tone, added kind sob, “I tried every way, nothing seems suit them!” “I least idea talking about,” said Alice. “I tried roots trees, I tried banks, I tried hedges,” Pigeon went on, without attending her; “but serpents! There pleasing them!” Alice puzzled, thought use saying anything till Pigeon finished. “As trouble enough hatching eggs,” said Pigeon; “but I must look-out serpents night day! Why, I wink sleep three weeks!” “I sorry annoyed,” said Alice, beginning see meaning. “And I would taken highest tree wood,” continued Pigeon, raising voice shriek, “and I thinking I free last, must needs come wriggling sky! Ugh, Serpent!” “But I _not_ serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I a—I a—” “Well! _What_ you?” said Pigeon. “I see trying invent something!” “I—I little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, remembered number changes gone day. “A likely story indeed!” said Pigeon tone deepest contempt. “I seen good many little girls time, never _one_ neck that! No, no! You serpent; use denying it. I suppose telling next never tasted egg!” “I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, truthful child; “but little girls eat eggs quite much serpents do, know.” “I believe it,” said Pigeon; “but do, kind serpent, I say.” This new idea Alice, quite silent minute two, gave Pigeon opportunity adding, “You looking eggs, I know _that_ well enough; matter whether little girl serpent?” “It matters good deal _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I looking eggs, happens; I was, I want _yours_: I like raw.” “Well, off, then!” said Pigeon sulky tone, settled nest. Alice crouched among trees well could, neck kept getting entangled among branches, every stop untwist it. After remembered still held pieces mushroom hands, set work carefully, nibbling first one other, growing sometimes taller sometimes shorter, succeeded bringing usual height. It long since anything near right size, felt quite strange first; got used minutes, began talking herself, usual. “Come, half plan done now! How puzzling changes are! I never sure I going be, one minute another! However, I got back right size: next thing is, get beautiful garden—how _is_ done, I wonder?” As said this, came suddenly upon open place, little house four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it never come upon _this_ size: why, I frighten wits!” So began nibbling righthand bit again, venture go near house till brought nine inches high. CHAPTER VI. Pig Pepper For minute two stood looking house, wondering next, suddenly footman livery came running wood—(she considered footman livery: otherwise, judging face only, would called fish)—and rapped loudly door knuckles. It opened another footman livery, round face, large eyes like frog; footmen, Alice noticed, powdered hair curled heads. She felt curious know about, crept little way wood listen. The Fish-Footman began producing arm great letter, nearly large himself, handed other, saying, solemn tone, “For Duchess. An invitation Queen play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, solemn tone, changing order words little, “From Queen. An invitation Duchess play croquet.” Then bowed low, curls got entangled together. Alice laughed much this, run back wood fear hearing her; next peeped Fish-Footman gone, sitting ground near door, staring stupidly sky. Alice went timidly door, knocked. “There sort use knocking,” said Footman, “and two reasons. First, I side door are; secondly, making noise inside, one could possibly hear you.” And certainly _was_ extraordinary noise going within—a constant howling sneezing, every great crash, dish kettle broken pieces. “Please, then,” said Alice, “how I get in?” “There might sense knocking,” Footman went without attending her, “if door us. For instance, _inside_, might knock, I could let out, know.” He looking sky time speaking, Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps cannot help it,” said herself; “his eyes _very_ nearly top head. But rate might answer questions.—How I get in?” repeated, aloud. “I shall sit here,” Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—” At moment door house opened, large plate came skimming out, straight Footman’s head: grazed nose, broke pieces one trees behind him. “—or next day, maybe,” Footman continued tone, exactly nothing happened. “How I get in?” asked Alice again, louder tone. “_Are_ get all?” said Footman. “That first question, know.” It was, doubt: Alice like told so. “It really dreadful,” muttered herself, “the way creatures argue. It enough drive one crazy!” The Footman seemed think good opportunity repeating remark, variations. “I shall sit here,” said, “on off, days days.” “But _I_ do?” said Alice. “Anything like,” said Footman, began whistling. “Oh, use talking him,” said Alice desperately: “he perfectly idiotic!” And opened door went in. The door led right large kitchen, full smoke one end other: Duchess sitting three-legged stool middle, nursing baby; cook leaning fire, stirring large cauldron seemed full soup. “There certainly much pepper soup!” Alice said herself, well could sneezing. There certainly much air. Even Duchess sneezed occasionally; baby, sneezing howling alternately without moment’s pause. The things kitchen sneeze, cook, large cat sitting hearth grinning ear ear. “Please would tell me,” said Alice, little timidly, quite sure whether good manners speak first, “why cat grins like that?” “It Cheshire cat,” said Duchess, “and why. Pig!” She said last word sudden violence Alice quite jumped; saw another moment addressed baby, her, took courage, went again:— “I know Cheshire cats always grinned; fact, I know cats _could_ grin.” “They can,” said Duchess; “and do.” “I know do,” Alice said politely, feeling quite pleased got conversation. “You know much,” said Duchess; “and fact.” Alice like tone remark, thought would well introduce subject conversation. While trying fix one, cook took cauldron soup fire, set work throwing everything within reach Duchess baby—the fire-irons came first; followed shower saucepans, plates, dishes. The Duchess took notice even hit her; baby howling much already, quite impossible say whether blows hurt not. “Oh, _please_ mind doing!” cried Alice, jumping agony terror. “Oh, goes _precious_ nose!” unusually large saucepan flew close it, nearly carried off. “If everybody minded business,” Duchess said hoarse growl, “the world would go round deal faster does.” “Which would _not_ advantage,” said Alice, felt glad get opportunity showing little knowledge. “Just think work would make day night! You see earth takes twenty-four hours turn round axis—” “Talking axes,” said Duchess, “chop head!” Alice glanced rather anxiously cook, see meant take hint; cook busily stirring soup, seemed listening, went again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; twelve? I—” “Oh, bother _me_,” said Duchess; “I never could abide figures!” And began nursing child again, singing sort lullaby so, giving violent shake end every line: “Speak roughly little boy, And beat sneezes: He annoy, Because knows teases.” CHORUS. (In cook baby joined): “Wow! wow! wow!” While Duchess sang second verse song, kept tossing baby violently down, poor little thing howled so, Alice could hardly hear words:— “I speak severely boy, I beat sneezes; For thoroughly enjoy The pepper pleases!” CHORUS. “Wow! wow! wow!” “Here! may nurse bit, like!” Duchess said Alice, flinging baby spoke. “I must go get ready play croquet Queen,” hurried room. The cook threw frying-pan went out, missed her. Alice caught baby difficulty, queer-shaped little creature, held arms legs directions, “just like star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing snorting like steam-engine caught it, kept doubling straightening again, altogether, first minute two, much could hold it. As soon made proper way nursing it, (which twist sort knot, keep tight hold right ear left foot, prevent undoing itself,) carried open air. “If I take child away me,” thought Alice, “they sure kill day two: would murder leave behind?” She said last words loud, little thing grunted reply (it left sneezing time). “Do grunt,” said Alice; “that proper way expressing yourself.” The baby grunted again, Alice looked anxiously face see matter it. There could doubt _very_ turn-up nose, much like snout real nose; also eyes getting extremely small baby: altogether Alice like look thing all. “But perhaps sobbing,” thought, looked eyes again, see tears. No, tears. “If going turn pig, dear,” said Alice, seriously, “I nothing you. Mind now!” The poor little thing sobbed (or grunted, impossible say which), went silence. Alice beginning think herself, “Now, I creature I get home?” grunted again, violently, looked face alarm. This time could _no_ mistake it: neither less pig, felt would quite absurd carry further. So set little creature down, felt quite relieved see trot away quietly wood. “If grown up,” said herself, “it would made dreadfully ugly child: makes rather handsome pig, I think.” And began thinking children knew, might well pigs, saying herself, “if one knew right way change them—” little startled seeing Cheshire Cat sitting bough tree yards off. The Cat grinned saw Alice. It looked good-natured, thought: still _very_ long claws great many teeth, felt ought treated respect. “Cheshire Puss,” began, rather timidly, know whether would like name: however, grinned little wider. “Come, pleased far,” thought Alice, went on. “Would tell me, please, way I ought go here?” “That depends good deal want get to,” said Cat. “I much care where—” said Alice. “Then matter way go,” said Cat. “—so long I get _somewhere_,” Alice added explanation. “Oh, sure that,” said Cat, “if walk long enough.” Alice felt could denied, tried another question. “What sort people live here?” “In _that_ direction,” Cat said, waving right paw round, “lives Hatter: _that_ direction,” waving paw, “lives March Hare. Visit either like: mad.” “But I want go among mad people,” Alice remarked. “Oh, cannot help that,” said Cat: “we mad here. I mad. You mad.” “How know I mad?” said Alice. “You must be,” said Cat, “or would come here.” Alice think proved all; however, went “And know mad?” “To begin with,” said Cat, “a dog’s mad. You grant that?” “I suppose so,” said Alice. “Well, then,” Cat went on, “you see, dog growls angry, wags tail pleased. Now _I_ growl I pleased, wag tail I angry. Therefore I mad.” “_I_ call purring, growling,” said Alice. “Call like,” said Cat. “Do play croquet Queen to-day?” “I like much,” said Alice, “but I invited yet.” “You see there,” said Cat, vanished. Alice much surprised this, getting used queer things happening. While looking place been, suddenly appeared again. “By-the-bye, became baby?” said Cat. “I would nearly forgotten ask.” “It turned pig,” Alice quietly said, come back natural way. “I thought would,” said Cat, vanished again. Alice waited little, half expecting see again, appear, minute two walked direction March Hare said live. “I seen hatters before,” said herself; “the March Hare much interesting, perhaps May raving mad—at least mad March.” As said this, looked up, Cat again, sitting branch tree. “Did say pig, fig?” said Cat. “I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish would keep appearing vanishing suddenly: make one quite giddy.” “All right,” said Cat; time vanished quite slowly, beginning end tail, ending grin, remained time rest gone. “Well! I often seen cat without grin,” thought Alice; “but grin without cat! It curious thing I ever saw life!” She gone much farther came sight house March Hare: thought must right house, chimneys shaped like ears roof thatched fur. It large house, like go nearer till nibbled lefthand bit mushroom, raised two feet high: even walked towards rather timidly, saying “Suppose raving mad all! I almost wish I would gone see Hatter instead!” CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party There table set tree front house, March Hare Hatter tea it: Dormouse sitting them, fast asleep, two using cushion, resting elbows it, talking head. “Very uncomfortable Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, asleep, I suppose mind.” The table large one, three crowded together one corner it: “No room! No room!” cried saw Alice coming. “There _plenty_ room!” said Alice indignantly, sat large arm-chair one end table. “Have wine,” March Hare said encouraging tone. Alice looked round table, nothing tea. “I see wine,” remarked. “There any,” said March Hare. “Then civil offer it,” said Alice angrily. “It civil sit without invited,” said March Hare. “I know _your_ table,” said Alice; “it laid great many three.” “Your hair wants cutting,” said Hatter. He looking Alice time great curiosity, first speech. “You learn make personal remarks,” Alice said severity; “it rude.” The Hatter opened eyes wide hearing this; _said_ was, “Why raven like writing-desk?” “Come, shall fun now!” thought Alice. “I glad begun asking riddles.—I believe I guess that,” added aloud. “Do mean think find answer it?” said March Hare. “Exactly so,” said Alice. “Then say mean,” March Hare went on. “I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean I say—that thing, know.” “Not thing bit!” said Hatter. “You might well say ‘I see I eat’ thing ‘I eat I see’!” “You might well say,” added March Hare, “that ‘I like I get’ thing ‘I get I like’!” “You might well say,” added Dormouse, seemed talking sleep, “that ‘I breathe I sleep’ thing ‘I sleep I breathe’!” “It _is_ thing you,” said Hatter, conversation dropped, party sat silent minute, Alice thought could remember ravens writing-desks, much. The Hatter first break silence. “What day month it?” said, turning Alice: taken watch pocket, looking uneasily, shaking every then, holding ear. Alice considered little, said “The fourth.” “Two days wrong!” sighed Hatter. “I told butter would suit works!” added looking angrily March Hare. “It _best_ butter,” March Hare meekly replied. “Yes, crumbs must got well,” Hatter grumbled: “you put bread-knife.” The March Hare took watch looked gloomily: dipped cup tea, looked again: could think nothing better say first remark, “It _best_ butter, know.” Alice looking shoulder curiosity. “What funny watch!” remarked. “It tells day month, tell clock is!” “Why it?” muttered Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell year is?” “Of course not,” Alice replied readily: “but stays year long time together.” “Which case _mine_,” said Hatter. Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed sort meaning it, yet certainly English. “I quite understand you,” said, politely could. “The Dormouse asleep again,” said Hatter, poured little hot tea upon nose. The Dormouse shook head impatiently, said, without opening eyes, “Of course, course; I going remark myself.” “Have guessed riddle yet?” Hatter said, turning Alice again. “No, I give up,” Alice replied: “what answer?” “I slightest idea,” said Hatter. “Nor I,” said March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. “I think might something better time,” said, “than waste asking riddles answers.” “If knew Time well I do,” said Hatter, “you would talk wasting _it_. It _him_.” “I know mean,” said Alice. “Of course not!” Hatter said, tossing head contemptuously. “I dare say never even spoke Time!” “Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I beat time I learn music.” “Ah! accounts it,” said Hatter. “He stand beating. Now, kept good terms him, would almost anything liked clock. For instance, suppose nine clock morning, time begin lessons: would whisper hint Time, round goes clock twinkling! Half-past one, time dinner!” (“I wish was,” March Hare said whisper.) “That would grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I hungry it, know.” “Not first, perhaps,” said Hatter: “but could keep half-past one long liked.” “Is way _you_ manage?” Alice asked. The Hatter shook head mournfully. “Not I!” replied. “We quarrelled last March—just _he_ went mad, know—” (pointing tea spoon March Hare,) “—it great concert given Queen Hearts, I sing ‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder at!’ You know song, perhaps?” “I heard something like it,” said Alice. “It goes on, know,” Hatter continued, “in way:— ‘Up world fly, Like tea-tray sky. Twinkle, twinkle—’” Here Dormouse shook itself, began singing sleep “_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” went long pinch make stop. “Well, I would hardly finished first verse,” said Hatter, “when Queen jumped bawled out, ‘He murdering time! Off head!’” “How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice. “And ever since that,” Hatter went mournful tone, “he thing I ask! It always six clock now.” A bright idea came Alice’s head. “Is reason many tea-things put here?” asked. “Yes, it,” said Hatter sigh: “it always tea-time, time wash things whiles.” “Then keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice. “Exactly so,” said Hatter: “as things get used up.” “But happens come beginning again?” Alice ventured ask. “Suppose change subject,” March Hare interrupted, yawning. “I getting tired this. I vote young lady tells us story.” “I afraid I know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed proposal. “Then Dormouse shall!” cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And pinched sides once. The Dormouse slowly opened eyes. “I asleep,” said hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word fellows saying.” “Tell us story!” said March Hare. “Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice. “And quick it,” added Hatter, “or asleep done.” “Once upon time three little sisters,” Dormouse began great hurry; “and names Elsie, Lacie, Tillie; lived bottom well—” “What live on?” said Alice, always took great interest questions eating drinking. “They lived treacle,” said Dormouse, thinking minute two. “They could done that, know,” Alice gently remarked; “they would ill.” “So were,” said Dormouse; “_very_ ill.” Alice tried fancy extraordinary ways living would like, puzzled much, went on: “But live bottom well?” “Take tea,” March Hare said Alice, earnestly. “I nothing yet,” Alice replied offended tone, “so I cannot take more.” “You mean cannot take _less_,” said Hatter: “it easy take _more_ nothing.” “Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice. “Who making personal remarks now?” Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice quite know say this: helped tea bread-and-butter, turned Dormouse, repeated question. “Why live bottom well?” The Dormouse took minute two think it, said, “It treacle-well.” “There thing!” Alice beginning angrily, Hatter March Hare went “Sh! sh!” Dormouse sulkily remarked, “If cannot civil, would better finish story yourself.” “No, please go on!” Alice said humbly; “I interrupt again. I dare say may _one_.” “One, indeed!” said Dormouse indignantly. However, consented go on. “And three little sisters—they learning draw, know—” “What draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting promise. “Treacle,” said Dormouse, without considering time. “I want clean cup,” interrupted Hatter: “let us move one place on.” He moved spoke, Dormouse followed him: March Hare moved Dormouse’s place, Alice rather unwillingly took place March Hare. The Hatter one got advantage change: Alice good deal worse before, March Hare upset milk-jug plate. Alice wish offend Dormouse again, began cautiously: “But I understand. Where draw treacle from?” “You draw water water-well,” said Hatter; “so I think could draw treacle treacle-well—eh, stupid?” “But _in_ well,” Alice said Dormouse, choosing notice last remark. “Of course were,” said Dormouse; “—well in.” This answer confused poor Alice, let Dormouse go time without interrupting it. “They learning draw,” Dormouse went on, yawning rubbing eyes, getting sleepy; “and drew manner things—everything begins M—” “Why M?” said Alice. “Why not?” said March Hare. Alice silent. The Dormouse closed eyes time, going doze; but, pinched Hatter, woke little shriek, went on: “—that begins M, mouse-traps, moon, memory, muchness—you know say things “much muchness”—did ever see thing drawing muchness?” “Really, ask me,” said Alice, much confused, “I think—” “Then talk,” said Hatter. This piece rudeness Alice could bear: got great disgust, walked off; Dormouse fell asleep instantly, neither others took least notice going, though looked back twice, half hoping would call her: last time saw them, trying put Dormouse teapot. “At rate I never go _there_ again!” said Alice picked way wood. “It stupidest tea-party I ever life!” Just said this, noticed one trees door leading right it. “That curious!” thought. “But everything’s curious today. I think I may well go once.” And went. Once found long hall, close little glass table. “Now, I manage better time,” said herself, began taking little golden key, unlocking door led garden. Then went work nibbling mushroom (she kept piece pocket) till foot high: walked little passage: _then_—she found last beautiful garden, among bright flower-beds cool fountains. CHAPTER VIII. The Queen’s Croquet-Ground A large rose-tree stood near entrance garden: roses growing white, three gardeners it, busily painting red. Alice thought curious thing, went nearer watch them, came heard one say, “Look now, Five! Do go splashing paint like that!” “I could help it,” said Five, sulky tone; “Seven jogged elbow.” On Seven looked said, “That right, Five! Always lay blame others!” “_You’d_ better talk!” said Five. “I heard Queen say yesterday deserved beheaded!” “What for?” said one spoken first. “That none _your_ business, Two!” said Seven. “Yes, _is_ business!” said Five, “and I tell him—it bringing cook tulip-roots instead onions.” Seven flung brush, begun “Well, unjust things—” eye chanced fall upon Alice, stood watching them, checked suddenly: others looked round also, bowed low. “Would tell me,” said Alice, little timidly, “why painting roses?” Five Seven said nothing, looked Two. Two began low voice, “Why fact is, see, Miss, ought _red_ rose-tree, put white one mistake; Queen find out, heads cut off, know. So see, Miss, best, afore comes, to—” At moment Five, anxiously looking across garden, called “The Queen! The Queen!” three gardeners instantly threw flat upon faces. There sound many footsteps, Alice looked round, eager see Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; shaped like three gardeners, oblong flat, hands feet corners: next ten courtiers; ornamented diamonds, walked two two, soldiers did. After came royal children; ten them, little dears came jumping merrily along hand hand, couples: ornamented hearts. Next came guests, mostly Kings Queens, among Alice recognised White Rabbit: talking hurried nervous manner, smiling everything said, went without noticing her. Then followed Knave Hearts, carrying King’s crown crimson velvet cushion; and, last grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. Alice rather doubtful whether ought lie face like three gardeners, could remember ever heard rule processions; “and besides, would use procession,” thought she, “if people lie upon faces, could see it?” So stood still was, waited. When procession came opposite Alice, stopped looked her, Queen said severely “Who this?” She said Knave Hearts, bowed smiled reply. “Idiot!” said Queen, tossing head impatiently; and, turning Alice, went on, “What name, child?” “My name Alice, please Majesty,” said Alice politely; added, herself, “Why, pack cards, all. I need afraid them!” “And _these?_” said Queen, pointing three gardeners lying round rose-tree; for, see, lying faces, pattern backs rest pack, could tell whether gardeners, soldiers, courtiers, three children. “How _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised courage. “It business _mine_.” The Queen turned crimson fury, and, glaring moment like wild beast, screamed “Off head! Off—” “Nonsense!” said Alice, loudly decidedly, Queen silent. The King laid hand upon arm, timidly said “Consider, dear: child!” The Queen turned angrily away him, said Knave “Turn over!” The Knave so, carefully, one foot. “Get up!” said Queen, shrill, loud voice, three gardeners instantly jumped up, began bowing King, Queen, royal children, everybody else. “Leave that!” screamed Queen. “You make giddy.” And then, turning rose-tree, went on, “What _have_ here?” “May please Majesty,” said Two, humble tone, going one knee spoke, “we trying—” “_I_ see!” said Queen, meanwhile examining roses. “Off heads!” procession moved on, three soldiers remaining behind execute unfortunate gardeners, ran Alice protection. “You shall beheaded!” said Alice, put large flower-pot stood near. The three soldiers wandered minute two, looking them, quietly marched others. “Are heads off?” shouted Queen. “Their heads gone, please Majesty!” soldiers shouted reply. “That right!” shouted Queen. “Can play croquet?” The soldiers silent, looked Alice, question evidently meant her. “Yes!” shouted Alice. “Come on, then!” roared Queen, Alice joined procession, wondering much would happen next. “It is—it fine day!” said timid voice side. She walking White Rabbit, peeping anxiously face. “Very,” said Alice: “—where Duchess?” “Hush! Hush!” said Rabbit low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously shoulder spoke, raised upon tiptoe, put mouth close ear, whispered “She sentence execution.” “What for?” said Alice. “Did say ‘What pity!’?” Rabbit asked. “No, I not,” said Alice: “I think pity. I said ‘What for?’” “She boxed Queen’s ears—” Rabbit began. Alice gave little scream laughter. “Oh, hush!” Rabbit whispered frightened tone. “The Queen hear you! You see, came rather late, Queen said—” “Get places!” shouted Queen voice thunder, people began running directions, tumbling other; however, got settled minute two, game began. Alice thought never seen curious croquet-ground life; ridges furrows; balls live hedgehogs, mallets live flamingoes, soldiers double stand hands feet, make arches. The chief difficulty Alice found first managing flamingo: succeeded getting body tucked away, comfortably enough, arm, legs hanging down, generally, got neck nicely straightened out, going give hedgehog blow head, _would_ twist round look face, puzzled expression could help bursting laughing: got head down, going begin again, provoking find hedgehog unrolled itself, act crawling away: besides this, generally ridge furrow way wherever wanted send hedgehog to, and, doubled-up soldiers always getting walking parts ground, Alice soon came conclusion difficult game indeed. The players played without waiting turns, quarrelling while, fighting hedgehogs; short time Queen furious passion, went stamping about, shouting “Off head!” “Off head!” minute. Alice began feel uneasy: sure, yet dispute Queen, knew might happen minute, “and then,” thought she, “what would become me? They dreadfully fond beheading people here; great wonder is, one left alive!” She looking way escape, wondering whether could get away without seen, noticed curious appearance air: puzzled much first, but, watching minute two, made grin, said “It Cheshire Cat: I shall somebody talk to.” “How getting on?” said Cat, soon mouth enough speak with. Alice waited till eyes appeared, nodded. “It use speaking it,” thought, “till ears come, least one them.” In another minute whole head appeared, Alice put flamingo, began account game, feeling glad someone listen her. The Cat seemed think enough sight, appeared. “I think play fairly,” Alice began, rather complaining tone, “and quarrel dreadfully one cannot hear oneself speak—and seem rules particular; least, are, nobody attends them—and idea confusing things alive; instance, arch I got go next walking end ground—and I croqueted Queen’s hedgehog now, ran away saw mine coming!” “How like Queen?” said Cat low voice. “Not all,” said Alice: “she extremely—” Just noticed Queen close behind her, listening: went on, “—likely win, hardly worth finishing game.” The Queen smiled passed on. “Who _are_ talking to?” said King, going Alice, looking Cat’s head great curiosity. “It friend mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow introduce it.” “I like look all,” said King: “however, may kiss hand likes.” “I would rather not,” Cat remarked. “Do impertinent,” said King, “and look like that!” He got behind Alice spoke. “A cat may look king,” said Alice. “I read book, I remember where.” “Well, must removed,” said King decidedly, called Queen, passing moment, “My dear! I wish would cat removed!” The Queen one way settling difficulties, great small. “Off head!” said, without even looking round. “I fetch executioner myself,” said King eagerly, hurried off. Alice thought might well go back, see game going on, heard Queen’s voice distance, screaming passion. She already heard sentence three players executed missed turns, like look things all, game confusion never knew whether turn not. So went search hedgehog. The hedgehog engaged fight another hedgehog, seemed Alice excellent opportunity croqueting one other: difficulty was, flamingo gone across side garden, Alice could see trying helpless sort way fly tree. By time caught flamingo brought back, fight over, hedgehogs sight: “but matter much,” thought Alice, “as arches gone side ground.” So tucked away arm, might escape again, went back little conversation friend. When got back Cheshire Cat, surprised find quite large crowd collected round it: dispute going executioner, King, Queen, talking once, rest quite silent, looked uncomfortable. The moment Alice appeared, appealed three settle question, repeated arguments her, though, spoke once, found hard indeed make exactly said. The executioner’s argument was, could cut head unless body cut from: never thing before, going begin _his_ time life. The King’s argument was, anything head could beheaded, talk nonsense. The Queen’s argument was, something done less time would everybody executed, round. (It last remark made whole party look grave anxious.) Alice could think nothing else say “It belongs Duchess: would better ask _her_ it.” “She prison,” Queen said executioner: “fetch here.” And executioner went like arrow. The Cat’s head began fading away moment gone, and, time come back Duchess, entirely disappeared; King executioner ran wildly looking it, rest party went back game. CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle’s Story “You cannot think glad I see again, dear old thing!” said Duchess, tucked arm affectionately Alice’s, walked together. Alice glad find pleasant temper, thought perhaps pepper made savage met kitchen. “When _I’m_ Duchess,” said herself, (not hopeful tone though), “I pepper kitchen _at all_. Soup well without—Maybe always pepper makes people hot-tempered,” went on, much pleased found new kind rule, “and vinegar makes sour—and camomile makes bitter—and—and barley-sugar things make children sweet-tempered. I wish people knew _that_: would stingy it, know—” She quite forgotten Duchess time, little startled heard voice close ear. “You thinking something, dear, makes forget talk. I cannot tell moral is, I shall remember bit.” “Perhaps one,” Alice ventured remark. “Tut, tut, child!” said Duchess. “Everything’s got moral, find it.” And squeezed closer Alice’s side spoke. Alice much like keeping close her: first, Duchess _very_ ugly; secondly, exactly right height rest chin upon Alice’s shoulder, uncomfortably sharp chin. However, like rude, bore well could. “The game’s going rather better now,” said, way keeping conversation little. “It Is so,” said Duchess: “and moral is—‘Oh, love, love, makes world go round!’” “Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that done everybody minding business!” “Ah, well! It means much thing,” said Duchess, digging sharp little chin Alice’s shoulder added, “and moral _that_ is—‘Take care sense, sounds take care themselves.’” “How fond finding morals things!” Alice thought herself. “I dare say wondering I put arm round waist,” Duchess said pause: “the reason is, I doubtful temper flamingo. Shall I try experiment?” “He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, feeling anxious experiment tried. “Very true,” said Duchess: “flamingoes mustard bite. And moral is—‘Birds feather flock together.’” “Only mustard bird,” Alice remarked. “Right, usual,” said Duchess: “what clear way putting things!” “It mineral, I _think_,” said Alice. “Of course is,” said Duchess, seemed ready agree everything Alice said; “there large mustard-mine near here. And moral is—‘The mine, less yours.’” “Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, attended last remark, “it vegetable. It look like one, is.” “I quite agree you,” said Duchess; “and moral is—‘Be would seem be’—or would like put simply—‘Never imagine otherwise might appear others might otherwise would appeared otherwise.’” “I think I understand better,” Alice said politely, “if I written down: I cannot quite follow say it.” “That nothing I could say I chose,” Duchess replied, pleased tone. “Pray trouble say longer that,” said Alice. “Oh, talk trouble!” said Duchess. “I make present everything I said yet.” “A cheap sort present!” thought Alice. “I glad give birthday presents like that!” But venture say loud. “Thinking again?” Duchess asked, another dig sharp little chin. “I right think,” said Alice sharply, beginning feel little worried. “Just much right,” said Duchess, “as pigs fly; m—” But here, Alice’s great surprise, Duchess’s voice died away, even middle favourite word ‘moral,’ arm linked began tremble. Alice looked up, stood Queen front them, arms folded, frowning like thunderstorm. “A fine day, Majesty!” Duchess began low, weak voice. “Now, I give fair warning,” shouted Queen, stamping ground spoke; “either head must off, half time! Take choice!” The Duchess took choice, gone moment. “Let us go game,” Queen said Alice; Alice much frightened say word, slowly followed back croquet-ground. The guests taken advantage Queen’s absence, resting shade: however, moment saw her, hurried back game, Queen merely remarking moment’s delay would cost lives. All time playing Queen never left quarrelling players, shouting “Off head!” “Off head!” Those sentenced taken custody soldiers, course leave arches this, end half hour arches left, players, except King, Queen, Alice, custody sentence execution. Then Queen left off, quite breath, said Alice, “Have seen Mock Turtle yet?” “No,” said Alice. “I even know Mock Turtle is.” “It thing Mock Turtle Soup made from,” said Queen. “I never saw one, heard one,” said Alice. “Come on, then,” said Queen, “and shall tell history,” As walked together, Alice heard King say low voice, company generally, “You pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ good thing!” said herself, felt quite unhappy number executions Queen ordered. They soon came upon Gryphon, lying fast asleep sun. (If know Gryphon is, look picture.) “Up, lazy thing!” said Queen, “and take young lady see Mock Turtle, hear history. I must go back see executions I ordered;” walked off, leaving Alice alone Gryphon. Alice quite like look creature, whole thought would quite safe stay go savage Queen: waited. The Gryphon sat rubbed eyes: watched Queen till sight: chuckled. “What fun!” said Gryphon, half itself, half Alice. “What _is_ fun?” said Alice. “Why, _she_,” said Gryphon. “It fancy, that: never executes nobody, know. Come on!” “Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, went slowly it: “I never ordered life, never!” They gone far saw Mock Turtle distance, sitting sad lonely little ledge rock, and, came nearer, Alice could hear sighing heart would break. She pitied deeply. “What sorrow?” asked Gryphon, Gryphon answered, nearly words before, “It fancy, that: got sorrow, know. Come on!” So went Mock Turtle, looked large eyes full tears, said nothing. “This young lady,” said Gryphon, “she wants know history, do.” “I tell her,” said Mock Turtle deep, hollow tone: “sit down, you, speak word till I finished.” So sat down, nobody spoke minutes. Alice thought herself, “I see _ever_ finish, begin.” But waited patiently. “Once,” said Mock Turtle last, deep sigh, “I real Turtle.” These words followed long silence, broken occasional exclamation “Hjckrrh!” Gryphon, constant heavy sobbing Mock Turtle. Alice nearly getting saying, “Thank you, sir, interesting story,” could help thinking _must_ come, sat still said nothing. “When little,” Mock Turtle went last, calmly, though still sobbing little then, “we went school sea. The master old Turtle—we used call Tortoise—” “Why call Tortoise, one?” Alice asked. “We called Tortoise taught us,” said Mock Turtle angrily: “really dull!” “You ought ashamed asking simple question,” added Gryphon; sat silent looked poor Alice, felt ready sink earth. At last Gryphon said Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Do day it!” went words: “Yes, went school sea, though may believe it—” “I never said I not!” interrupted Alice. “You did,” said Mock Turtle. “Hold tongue!” added Gryphon, Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on. “We best educations—in fact, went school every day—” “_I’ve_ day-school, too,” said Alice; “you need proud that.” “With extras?” asked Mock Turtle little anxiously. “Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French music.” “And washing?” said Mock Turtle. “Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly. “Ah! really good school,” said Mock Turtle tone great relief. “Now _ours_ end bill, ‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’” “You could wanted much,” said Alice; “living bottom sea.” “I could afford learn it.” said Mock Turtle sigh. “I took regular course.” “What that?” inquired Alice. “Reeling Writhing, course, begin with,” Mock Turtle replied; “and different branches Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, Derision.” “I never heard ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured say. “What it?” The Gryphon lifted paws surprise. “What! Never heard uglifying!” exclaimed. “You know beautify is, I suppose?” “Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.” “Well, then,” Gryphon went on, “if know uglify is, _are_ simpleton.” Alice feel encouraged ask questions it, turned Mock Turtle, said “What else learn?” “Well, Mystery,” Mock Turtle replied, counting subjects flappers, “—Mystery, ancient modern, Seaography: Drawling—the Drawling-master old conger-eel, used come week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, Fainting Coils.” “What _that_ like?” said Alice. “Well, I cannot show myself,” Mock Turtle said: “I stiff. And Gryphon never learnt it.” “Had time,” said Gryphon: “I went Classics master, though. He old crab, _he_ was.” “I never went him,” Mock Turtle said sigh: “he taught Laughing Grief, used say.” “So did, did,” said Gryphon, sighing turn; creatures hid faces paws. “And many hours day lessons?” said Alice, hurry change subject. “Ten hours first day,” said Mock Turtle: “nine next, on.” “What curious plan!” exclaimed Alice. “That reason called lessons,” Gryphon remarked: “because lessen day day.” This quite new idea Alice, thought little made next remark. “Then eleventh day must holiday?” “Of course was,” said Mock Turtle. “And manage twelfth?” Alice went eagerly. “That enough lessons,” Gryphon interrupted decided tone: “tell something games now.” CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, drew back one flapper across eyes. He looked Alice, tried speak, minute two sobs choked voice. “Same bone throat,” said Gryphon: set work shaking punching back. At last Mock Turtle recovered voice, and, tears running cheeks, went again:— “You may lived much sea—” (“I not,” said Alice)—“and perhaps never even introduced lobster—” (Alice began say “I tasted—” checked hastily, said “No, never”) “—so idea delightful thing Lobster Quadrille is!” “No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort dance it?” “Why,” said Gryphon, “you first form line along sea-shore—” “Two lines!” cried Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, on; then, cleared jelly-fish way—” “_That_ generally takes time,” interrupted Gryphon. “—you advance twice—” “Each lobster partner!” cried Gryphon. “Of course,” Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set partners—” “—change lobsters, retire order,” continued Gryphon. “Then, know,” Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—” “The lobsters!” shouted Gryphon, bound air. “—as far sea can—” “Swim them!” screamed Gryphon. “Turn somersault sea!” cried Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. “Change lobsters again!” yelled Gryphon top voice. “Back land again, first figure,” said Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping voice; two creatures, jumping like mad things time, sat sadly quietly, looked Alice. “It must pretty dance,” said Alice timidly. “Would like see little it?” said Mock Turtle. “Very much indeed,” said Alice. “Come, let us try first figure!” said Mock Turtle Gryphon. “We without lobsters, know. Which shall sing?” “Oh, _you_ sing,” said Gryphon. “I forgotten words.” So began solemnly dancing round round Alice, every treading toes passed close, waving forepaws mark time, Mock Turtle sang this, slowly sadly:— “Will walk little faster?” said whiting snail. “There porpoise close behind us, treading tail. See eagerly lobsters turtles advance! They waiting shingle—will come join dance? Will you, you, you, you, join dance? Will you, you, you, you, join dance? “You really notion delightful When take us throw us, lobsters, sea!” But snail replied “Too far, far!” gave look askance— Said thanked whiting kindly, would join dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would join dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could join dance. “What matters far go?” scaly friend replied. “There another shore, know, upon side. The England nearer France— Then turn pale, beloved snail, come join dance. Will you, you, you, you, join dance? Will you, you, you, you, join dance?” “Thank you, interesting dance watch,” said Alice, feeling glad last: “and I like curious song whiting!” “Oh, whiting,” said Mock Turtle, “they—you seen them, course?” “Yes,” said Alice, “I often seen dinn—” checked hastily. “I know Dinn may be,” said Mock Turtle, “but seen often, course know like.” “I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They tails mouths—and crumbs.” “You wrong crumbs,” said Mock Turtle: “crumbs would wash sea. But _have_ tails mouths; reason is—” Mock Turtle yawned shut eyes.—“Tell reason that,” said Gryphon. “The reason is,” said Gryphon, “that _would_ go lobsters dance. So got thrown sea. So fall long way. So got tails fast mouths. So could get again. That all.” “Thank you,” said Alice, “it interesting. I never knew much whiting before.” “I tell that, like,” said Gryphon. “Do know called whiting?” “I never thought it,” said Alice. “Why?” “_It boots shoes_,” Gryphon replied solemnly. Alice thoroughly puzzled. “Does boots shoes!” repeated wondering tone. “Why, _your_ shoes done with?” said Gryphon. “I mean, makes shiny?” Alice looked them, considered little gave answer. “They done blacking, I believe.” “Boots shoes sea,” Gryphon went deep voice, “are done whiting. Now know.” “And made of?” Alice asked tone great curiosity. “Soles eels, course,” Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp could told that.” “If I would whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts still running song, “I would said porpoise, ‘Keep back, please: want _you_ us!’” “They obliged them,” Mock Turtle said: “no wise fish would go anywhere without porpoise.” “Would really?” said Alice tone great surprise. “Of course not,” said Mock Turtle: “why, fish came _me_, told going journey, I say ‘With porpoise?’” “Do mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice. “I mean I say,” Mock Turtle replied offended tone. And Gryphon added “Come, let us hear _your_ adventures.” “I could tell adventures—beginning morning,” said Alice little timidly: “but use going back yesterday, I different person then.” “Explain that,” said Mock Turtle. “No, no! The adventures first,” said Gryphon impatient tone: “explanations take dreadful time.” So Alice began telling adventures time first saw White Rabbit. She little nervous first, two creatures got close her, one side, opened eyes mouths _very_ wide, gained courage went on. Her listeners perfectly quiet till got part repeating “_You old, Father William_,” Caterpillar, words coming different, Mock Turtle drew long breath, said “That curious.” “It curious be,” said Gryphon. “It came different!” Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I like hear try repeat something now. Tell begin.” He looked Gryphon thought kind authority Alice. “Stand repeat ‘’_Tis voice sluggard_,’” said Gryphon. “How creatures order one about, make one repeat lessons!” thought Alice; “I might well school once.” However, got up, began repeat it, head full Lobster Quadrille, hardly knew saying, words came queer indeed:— “It Is voice Lobster; I heard declare, “You baked brown, I must sugar hair.” As duck eyelids, nose Trims belt buttons, turns toes.” [later editions continued follows When sands dry, gay lark, And talk contemptuous tones Shark, But, tide rises sharks around, His voice timid tremulous sound.] “That different _I_ used say I child,” said Gryphon. “Well, I never heard before,” said Mock Turtle; “but sounds uncommon nonsense.” Alice said nothing; sat face hands, wondering anything would _ever_ happen natural way again. “I like explained,” said Mock Turtle. “She cannot explain it,” said Gryphon hastily. “Go next verse.” “But toes?” Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ turn nose, know?” “It first position dancing.” Alice said; dreadfully puzzled whole thing, longed change subject. “Go next verse,” Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it begins ‘_I passed garden_.’” Alice dare disobey, though felt sure would come wrong, went trembling voice:— “I passed garden, marked, one eye, How Owl Panther sharing pie—” [later editions continued follows The Panther took pie-crust, gravy, meat, While Owl dish share treat. When pie finished, Owl, boon, Was kindly permitted pocket spoon: While Panther received knife fork growl, And concluded banquet—] “What _is_ use repeating stuff,” Mock Turtle interrupted, “if explain go on? It far confusing thing _I_ ever heard!” “Yes, I think would better leave off,” said Gryphon: Alice glad so. “Shall try another figure Lobster Quadrille?” Gryphon went on. “Or would like Mock Turtle sing song?” “Oh, song, please, Mock Turtle would kind,” Alice replied, eagerly Gryphon said, rather offended tone, “Hm! No accounting tastes! Sing ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ you, old fellow?” The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, began, voice sometimes choked sobs, sing this:— “Beautiful Soup, rich green, Waiting hot tureen! Who dainties would stoop? Soup evening, beautiful Soup! Soup evening, beautiful Soup! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop e—e—evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup! “Beautiful Soup! Who cares fish, Game, dish? Who would give else two p ennyworth beautiful Soup? Pennyworth beautiful Soup? Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop e—e—evening, Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!” “Chorus again!” cried Gryphon, Mock Turtle begun repeat it, cry “The trial’s beginning!” heard distance. “Come on!” cried Gryphon, and, taking Alice hand, hurried off, without waiting end song. “What trial it?” Alice panted ran; Gryphon answered “Come on!” ran faster, faintly came, carried breeze followed them, melancholy words:— “Soo—oop e—e—evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!” CHAPTER XI. Who Stole Tarts? The King Queen Hearts seated throne arrived, great crowd assembled them—all sorts little birds beasts, well whole pack cards: Knave standing them, chains, soldier side guard him; near King White Rabbit, trumpet one hand, scroll parchment other. In middle court table, large dish tarts upon it: looked good, made Alice quite hungry look them—“I wish would get trial done,” thought, “and hand round refreshments!” But seemed chance this, began looking everything her, pass away time. Alice never court justice before, read books, quite pleased find knew name nearly everything there. “That judge,” said herself, “because great wig.” The judge, way, King; wore crown wig, (look frontispiece want see it,) look comfortable, certainly becoming. “And jury-box,” thought Alice, “and twelve creatures,” (she obliged say “creatures,” see, animals, birds,) “I suppose jurors.” She said last word two three times herself, rather proud it: thought, rightly too, little girls age knew meaning all. However, “jury-men” would done well. The twelve jurors writing busily slates. “What doing?” Alice whispered Gryphon. “They cannot anything put yet, trial’s begun.” “They putting names,” Gryphon whispered reply, “for fear forget end trial.” “Stupid things!” Alice began loud, indignant voice, stopped hastily, White Rabbit cried out, “Silence court!” King put spectacles looked anxiously round, make talking. Alice could see, well looking shoulders, jurors writing “stupid things!” slates, could even make one know spell “stupid,” ask neighbour tell him. “A nice muddle slates’ll trial’s over!” thought Alice. One jurors pencil squeaked. This course, Alice could _not_ stand, went round court got behind him, soon found opportunity taking away. She quickly poor little juror (it Bill, Lizard) could make become it; so, hunting it, obliged write one finger rest day; little use, left mark slate. “Herald, read accusation!” said King. On White Rabbit blew three blasts trumpet, unrolled parchment scroll, read follows:— “The Queen Hearts, made tarts, All summer day: The Knave Hearts, stole tarts, And took quite away!” “Consider verdict,” King said jury. “Not yet, yet!” Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There great deal come that!” “Call first witness,” said King; White Rabbit blew three blasts trumpet, called out, “First witness!” The first witness Hatter. He came teacup one hand piece bread-and-butter other. “I beg pardon, Majesty,” began, “for bringing in: I quite finished tea I sent for.” “You ought finished,” said King. “When begin?” The Hatter looked March Hare, followed court, arm-in-arm Dormouse. “Fourteenth March, I _think_ was,” said. “Fifteenth,” said March Hare. “Sixteenth,” added Dormouse. “Write down,” King said jury, jury eagerly wrote three dates slates, added up, reduced answer shillings pence. “Take hat,” King said Hatter. “It mine,” said Hatter. “_Stolen!_” King exclaimed, turning jury, instantly made memorandum fact. “I keep sell,” Hatter added explanation; “I none own. I hatter.” Here Queen put spectacles, began staring Hatter, turned pale fidgeted. “Give evidence,” said King; “and nervous, I executed spot.” This seem encourage witness all: kept shifting one foot other, looking uneasily Queen, confusion bit large piece teacup instead bread-and-butter. Just moment Alice felt curious sensation, puzzled good deal made was: beginning grow larger again, thought first would get leave court; second thoughts decided remain long room her. “I wish would squeeze so.” said Dormouse, sitting next her. “I hardly breathe.” “I cannot help it,” said Alice meekly: “I growing.” “You right grow _here_,” said Dormouse. “Do talk nonsense,” said Alice boldly: “you know growing too.” “Yes, _I_ grow reasonable pace,” said Dormouse: “not ridiculous fashion.” And got sulkily crossed side court. All time Queen never left staring Hatter, and, Dormouse crossed court, said one officers court, “Bring list singers last concert!” wretched Hatter trembled so, shook shoes off. “Give evidence,” King repeated angrily, “or I executed, whether nervous not.” “I poor man, Majesty,” Hatter began, trembling voice, “—and I begun tea—not week so—and bread-and-butter getting thin—and twinkling tea—” “The twinkling _what?_” said King. “It _began_ tea,” Hatter replied. “Of course twinkling begins T!” said King sharply. “Do take dunce? Go on!” “I poor man,” Hatter went on, “and things twinkled that—only March Hare said—” “I not!” March Hare interrupted great hurry. “You did!” said Hatter. “I deny it!” said March Hare. “He denies it,” said King: “leave part.” “Well, rate, Dormouse said—” Hatter went on, looking anxiously round see would deny too: Dormouse denied nothing, fast asleep. “After that,” continued Hatter, “I cut bread-and-butter—” “But Dormouse say?” one jury asked. “That I cannot remember,” said Hatter. “You _must_ remember,” remarked King, “or I executed.” The miserable Hatter dropped teacup bread-and-butter, went one knee. “I poor man, Majesty,” began. “You _very_ poor _speaker_,” said King. Here one guinea-pigs cheered, immediately suppressed officers court. (As rather hard word, I explain done. They large canvas bag, tied mouth strings: slipped guinea-pig, head first, sat upon it.) “I glad I seen done,” thought Alice. “I often read newspapers, end trials, “There attempts applause, immediately suppressed officers court,” I never understood meant till now.” “If know it, may stand down,” continued King. “I cannot go lower,” said Hatter: “I floor, is.” “Then may _sit_ down,” King replied. Here guinea-pig cheered, suppressed. “Come, finished guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now shall get better.” “I would rather finish tea,” said Hatter, anxious look Queen, reading list singers. “You may go,” said King, Hatter hurriedly left court, without even waiting put shoes on. “—and take head outside,” Queen added one officers: Hatter sight officer could get door. “Call next witness!” said King. The next witness Duchess’s cook. She carried pepper-box hand, Alice guessed was, even got court, way people near door began sneezing once. “Give evidence,” said King. “Shall not,” said cook. The King looked anxiously White Rabbit, said low voice, “Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.” “Well, I must, I must,” King said, melancholy air, and, folding arms frowning cook till eyes nearly sight, said deep voice, “What tarts made of?” “Pepper, mostly,” said cook. “Treacle,” said sleepy voice behind her. “Collar Dormouse,” Queen shrieked out. “Behead Dormouse! Turn Dormouse court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off whiskers!” For minutes whole court confusion, getting Dormouse turned out, and, time settled again, cook disappeared. “Never mind!” said King, air great relief. “Call next witness.” And added undertone Queen, “Really, dear, _you_ must cross-examine next witness. It quite makes forehead ache!” Alice watched White Rabbit fumbled list, feeling curious see next witness would like, “—for got much evidence _yet_,” said herself. Imagine surprise, White Rabbit read out, top shrill little voice, name “Alice!” CHAPTER XII. Alice’s Evidence “Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting flurry moment large grown last minutes, jumped hurry tipped jury-box edge skirt, upsetting jurymen heads crowd below, lay sprawling about, reminding much globe goldfish accidentally upset week before. “Oh, I _beg_ pardon!” exclaimed tone great dismay, began picking quickly could, accident goldfish kept running head, vague sort idea must collected put back jury-box, would die. “The trial cannot proceed,” said King grave voice, “until jurymen back proper places—_all_,” repeated great emphasis, looking hard Alice said so. Alice looked jury-box, saw that, haste, put Lizard head downwards, poor little thing waving tail melancholy way, quite unable move. She soon got again, put right; “not signifies much,” said herself; “I think would _quite_ much use trial one way other.” As soon jury little recovered shock upset, slates pencils found handed back them, set work diligently write history accident, except Lizard, seemed much overcome anything sit mouth open, gazing roof court. “What know business?” King said Alice. “Nothing,” said Alice. “Nothing _whatever?_” persisted King. “Nothing whatever,” said Alice. “That important,” King said, turning jury. They beginning write slates, White Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, Majesty means, course,” said respectful tone, frowning making faces spoke. “_Un_important, course, I meant,” King hastily said, went undertone, “important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” trying word sounded best. Some jury wrote “important,” “unimportant.” Alice could see this, near enough look slates; “but matter bit,” thought herself. At moment King, time busily writing note-book, cackled “Silence!” read book, “Rule Forty-two. _All persons mile high leave court_.” Everybody looked Alice. “_I’m_ mile high,” said Alice. “You are,” said King. “Nearly two miles high,” added Queen. “Well, I shall go, rate,” said Alice: “besides, regular rule: invented now.” “It oldest rule book,” said King. “Then ought Number One,” said Alice. The King turned pale, shut note-book hastily. “Consider verdict,” said jury, low, trembling voice. “There evidence come yet, please Majesty,” said White Rabbit, jumping great hurry; “this paper picked up.” “What it?” said Queen. “I opened yet,” said White Rabbit, “but seems letter, written prisoner to—to somebody.” “It must that,” said King, “unless written nobody, usual, know.” “Who directed to?” said one jurymen. “It directed all,” said White Rabbit; “in fact, nothing written _outside_.” He unfolded paper spoke, added “It letter, all: set verses.” “Are prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another jurymen. “No, not,” said White Rabbit, “and queerest thing it.” (The jury looked puzzled.) “He must imitated somebody else’s hand,” said King. (The jury brightened again.) “Please Majesty,” said Knave, “I write it, cannot prove I did: name signed end.” “If sign it,” said King, “that makes matter worse. You _must_ meant mischief, else would signed name like honest man.” There general clapping hands this: first really clever thing King said day. “That _proves_ guilt,” said Queen. “It proves nothing sort!” said Alice. “Why, even know about!” “Read them,” said King. The White Rabbit put spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please Majesty?” asked. “Begin beginning,” King said gravely, “and go till come end: stop.” These verses White Rabbit read:— “They told her, And mentioned him: She gave good character, But said I could swim. He sent word I gone (We know true): If push matter on, What would become you? I gave one, gave two, You gave us three more; They returned you, Though mine before. If I chance Involved affair, He trusts set free, Exactly were. My notion (Before fit) An obstacle came Him, ourselves, it. Do let know liked best, For must ever A secret, kept rest, Between me.” “That important piece evidence heard yet,” said King, rubbing hands; “so let jury—” “If one explain it,” said Alice, (she grown large last minutes bit afraid interrupting him,) “I give sixpence. _I_ believe atom meaning it.” The jury wrote slates, “_She_ believe atom meaning it,” none attempted explain paper. “If meaning it,” said King, “that saves world trouble, know, need try find any. And yet I know,” went on, spreading verses knee, looking one eye; “I seem see meaning them, all. “—_said I could swim_—” cannot swim, you?” added, turning Knave. The Knave shook head sadly. “Do I look like it?” said. (Which certainly _not_, made entirely cardboard.) “All right, far,” said King, went muttering verses himself: “‘_We know true_—’ jury, course—‘_I gave one, gave two_—’ why, must tarts, know—” “But, goes ‘_they returned you_,’” said Alice. “Why, are!” said King triumphantly, pointing tarts table. “Nothing clearer _that_. Then again—‘_before fit_—’ never fits, dear, I think?” said Queen. “Never!” said Queen furiously, throwing inkstand Lizard spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill left writing slate one finger, found made mark; hastily began again, using ink, trickling face, long lasted.) “Then words _fit_ you,” said King, looking round court smile. There dead silence. “It pun!” King added offended tone, everybody laughed, “Let jury consider verdict,” King said, twentieth time day. “No, no!” said Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.” “Stuff nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea sentence first!” “Hold tongue!” said Queen, turning purple. “I not!” said Alice. “Off head!” Queen shouted top voice. Nobody moved. “Who cares you?” said Alice, (she grown full size time.) “You nothing pack cards!” At whole pack rose air, came flying upon her: gave little scream, half fright half anger, tried beat off, found lying bank, head lap sister, gently brushing away dead leaves fluttered trees upon face. “Wake up, Alice dear!” said sister; “Why, long sleep had!” “Oh, I curious dream!” said Alice, told sister, well could remember them, strange Adventures reading about; finished, sister kissed her, said, “It _was_ curious dream, dear, certainly: run tea; getting late.” So Alice got ran off, thinking ran, well might, wonderful dream been. But sister sat still left her, leaning head hand, watching setting sun, thinking little Alice wonderful Adventures, till began dreaming fashion, dream:— First, dreamed little Alice herself, tiny hands clasped upon knee, bright eager eyes looking hers—she could hear tones voice, see queer little toss head keep back wandering hair _would_ always get eyes—and still listened, seemed listen, whole place around became alive strange creatures little sister’s dream. The long grass rustled feet White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed way neighbouring pool—she could hear rattle teacups March Hare friends shared never-ending meal, shrill voice Queen ordering unfortunate guests execution—once pig-baby sneezing Duchess’s knee, plates dishes crashed around it—once shriek Gryphon, squeaking Lizard’s slate-pencil, choking suppressed guinea-pigs, filled air, mixed distant sobs miserable Mock Turtle. So sat on, closed eyes, half believed Wonderland, though knew open again, would change dull reality—the grass would rustling wind, pool rippling waving reeds—the rattling teacups would change tinkling sheep-bells, Queen’s shrill cries voice shepherd boy—and sneeze baby, shriek Gryphon, queer noises, would change (she knew) confused clamour busy farm-yard—while lowing cattle distance would take place Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs. Lastly, pictured little sister would, after-time, grown woman; would keep, riper years, simple loving heart childhood: would gather little children, make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale, perhaps even dream Wonderland long ago: would feel simple sorrows, find pleasure simple joys, remembering child-life, happy summer days.
