 THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER CHAPTER I “TOM!” No answer. “TOM!” No answer. “What gone boy, I wonder? You TOM!” No answer. The old lady pulled spectacles looked room; put looked them. She seldom never looked _through_ small thing boy; state pair, pride heart, built “style,” service—she could seen pair stove-lids well. She looked perplexed moment, said, fiercely, still loud enough furniture hear: “Well, I lay I get hold I will—” She finish, time bending punching bed broom, needed breath punctuate punches with. She resurrected nothing cat. “I never see beat boy!” She went open door stood looked among tomato vines “jimpson” weeds constituted garden. No Tom. So lifted voice angle calculated distance shouted: “Y-o-you-you TOM!” There slight noise behind turned time seize small boy slack roundabout arrest flight. “There! I might ’a’ thought closet. What there?” “Nothing.” “Nothing! Look hands. And look mouth. What _is_ truck?” “I know, aunt.” “Well, I know. It jam—that is. Forty times I said let jam alone I would skin you. Hand switch.” The switch hovered air—the peril desperate— “My! Look behind you, aunt!” The old lady whirled round, snatched skirts danger. The lad fled instant, scrambled high board-fence, disappeared it. His aunt Polly stood surprised moment, broke gentle laugh. “Hang boy, cannot I never learn anything? Are played tricks enough like looking time? But old fools biggest fools is. Cannot learn old dog new tricks, saying is. But goodness, never plays alike, two days, body know coming? He ’pears know long torment I get dander up, knows make put minute make laugh, I cannot hit lick. I duty boy, Lord’s truth, goodness knows. Spare rod spile child, Good Book says. I laying sin suffering us both, I know. He full Old Scratch, laws-a-me! dead sister’s boy, poor thing, I got heart lash him, somehow. Every time I let off, conscience hurt so, every time I hit old heart breaks. Well-a-well, man born woman days full trouble, Scripture says, I reckon so. He play hookey evening, * [* Southwestern “afternoon”] I obleeged make work, tomorrow, punish him. It mighty hard make work Saturdays, boys holiday, hates work hates anything else, I _got_ duty him, I ruination child.” Tom play hookey, good time. He got back home barely season help Jim, small colored boy, saw next-day’s wood split kindlings supper—at least time tell adventures Jim Jim three-fourths work. Tom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid already part work (picking chips), quiet boy, adventurous, trouble-some ways. While Tom eating supper, stealing sugar opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked questions full guile, deep—for wanted trap damaging revealments. Like many simple-hearted souls, pet vanity believe endowed talent dark mysterious diplomacy, loved contemplate transparent devices marvels low cunning. Said she: “Tom, middling warm school, warn’t it?” “Yes’m.” “Powerful warm, warn’t it?” “Yes’m.” “Did want go a-swimming, Tom?” A bit scare shot Tom—a touch uncomfortable suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly’s face, told nothing. So said: “No’m—well, much.” The old lady reached hand felt Tom’s shirt, said: “But warm now, though.” And flattered reflect discovered shirt dry without anybody knowing mind. But spite her, Tom knew wind lay, now. So forestalled might next move: “Some us pumped heads—mine’s damp yet. See?” Aunt Polly vexed think overlooked bit circumstantial evidence, missed trick. Then new inspiration: “Tom, undo shirt collar I sewed it, pump head, you? Unbutton jacket!” The trouble vanished Tom’s face. He opened jacket. His shirt collar securely sewed. “Bother! Well, go ’long you. I would made sure would played hookey a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon kind singed cat, saying is—better’n look. _This_ time.” She half sorry sagacity miscarried, half glad Tom stumbled obedient conduct once. But Sidney said: “Well, now, I think sewed collar white thread, black.” “Why, I sew white! Tom!” But Tom wait rest. As went door said: “Siddy, I lick that.” In safe place Tom examined two large needles thrust lapels jacket, thread bound them—one needle carried white thread black. He said: “She would never noticed Sid. Confound it! sometimes sews white, sometimes sews black. I wish gee-miny would stick one t’other—I cannot keep run them. But I bet I lam Sid that. I learn him!” He Model Boy village. He knew model boy well though—and loathed him. Within two minutes, even less, forgotten troubles. Not troubles one whit less heavy bitter man’s man, new powerful interest bore drove mind time—just men’s misfortunes forgotten excitement new enterprises. This new interest valued novelty whistling, acquired negro, suffering practise un-disturbed. It consisted peculiar bird-like turn, sort liquid warble, produced touching tongue roof mouth short intervals midst music—the reader probably remembers it, ever boy. Diligence attention soon gave knack it, strode street mouth full harmony soul full gratitude. He felt much astronomer feels discovered new planet—no doubt, far strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure concerned, advantage boy, astronomer. The summer evenings long. It dark, yet. Presently Tom checked whistle. A stranger him—a boy shade larger himself. A new-comer age either sex am-pressive curiosity poor little shabby village St. Petersburg. This boy well dressed, too—well dressed week-day. This simply astounding. His cap dainty thing, close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout new natty, pantaloons. He shoes on—and Friday. He even wore necktie, bright bit ribbon. He citified air ate Tom’s vitals. The Tom stared splendid marvel, higher turned nose finery shabbier shabbier outfit seemed grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, moved—but sidewise, circle; kept face face eye eye time. Finally Tom said: “I lick you!” “I would like see try it.” “Well, I it.” “No cannot, either.” “Yes I can.” “No cannot.” “I can.” “You cannot.” “Can!” “Cannot!” An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said: “What name?” “’Tisn’t business, maybe.” “Well I ’low I _make_ business.” “Well you?” “If say much, I will.” “Much—much—_much_. There now.” “Oh, think mighty smart, _don’t_ you? I could lick one hand tied behind me, I wanted to.” “Well _do_ it? You _say_ it.” “Well I _will_, fool me.” “Oh yes—I seen whole families fix.” “Smarty! You think _some_, now, _don’t_ you? Oh, hat!” “You lump hat like it. I dare knock off—and anybody take dare suck eggs.” “You liar!” “You another.” “You fighting liar dare take up.” “Aw—take walk!” “Say—if give much sass I take bounce rock off’n head.” “Oh, _course_ will.” “Well I _will_.” “Well _do_ then? What keep _saying_ for? Why _do_ it? It afraid.” “I _ain’t_ afraid.” “You are.” “I not.” “You are.” Another pause, eying sidling around other. Presently shoulder shoulder. Tom said: “Get away here!” “Go away yourself!” “I not.” “I either.” So stood, foot placed angle brace, shoving might main, glowering hate. But neither could get advantage. After struggling till hot flushed, relaxed strain watchful caution, Tom said: “You coward pup. I tell big brother you, thrash little finger, I make it, too.” “What I care big brother? I got brother bigger is—and more, throw fence, too.” [Both brothers imaginary.] “That lie.” “_Your_ saying make so.” Tom drew line dust big toe, said: “I dare step that, I lick till cannot stand up. Anybody take dare steal sheep.” The new boy stepped promptly, said: “Now said would it, let us see it.” “Do crowd now; better look out.” “Well, _said_ would it—why it?” “By jingo! two cents I _will_ it.” The new boy took two broad coppers pocket held derision. Tom struck ground. In instant boys rolling tumbling dirt, gripped together like cats; space minute tugged tore other’s hair clothes, punched scratched other’s nose, covered dust glory. Presently confusion took form, fog battle Tom appeared, seated astride new boy, pounding fists. “Holler ’nuff!” said he. The boy struggled free himself. He crying—mainly rage. “Holler ’nuff!”—and pounding went on. At last stranger got smothered “’Nuff!” Tom let said: “Now learn you. Better look fooling next time.” The new boy went brushing dust clothes, sobbing, snuffling, occasionally looking back shaking head threatening would Tom “next time caught out.” To Tom responded jeers, started high feather, soon back turned new boy snatched stone, threw hit shoulders turned tail ran like antelope. Tom chased traitor home, thus found lived. He held position gate time, daring enemy come outside, enemy made faces window declined. At last enemy’s mother appeared, called Tom bad, vicious, vulgar child, ordered away. So went away; said “’lowed” “lay” boy. He got home pretty late night, climbed cautiously window, uncovered ambuscade, person aunt; saw state clothes resolution turn Saturday holiday captivity hard labor became adamantine firmness. CHAPTER II SATURDAY morning come, summer world bright fresh, brimming life. There song every heart; heart young music issued lips. There cheer every face spring every step. The locust-trees bloom fragrance blossoms filled air. Cardiff Hill, beyond village it, green vegetation lay far enough away seem Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, inviting. Tom appeared sidewalk bucket whitewash long-handled brush. He surveyed fence, gladness left deep melancholy settled upon spirit. Thirty yards board fence nine feet high. Life seemed hollow, existence burden. Sighing, dipped brush passed along topmost plank; repeated operation; again; compared insignificant whitewashed streak far-reaching continent unwhitewashed fence, sat tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping gate tin pail, singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water town pump always hateful work Tom’s eyes, before, strike so. He remembered company pump. White, mulatto, negro boys girls always waiting turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And remembered although pump hundred fifty yards off, Jim never got back bucket water hour—and even somebody generally go him. Tom said: “Say, Jim, I fetch water whitewash some.” Jim shook head said: “Cannot, Mars Tom. Ole missis, tole I got go an’ git dis water an’ stop foolin’ roun’ wid anybody. She say spec’ Mars Tom gwine ax whitewash, an’ tole go ’long an’ ’tend business—she ’lowed _she’d_ ’tend de whitewashin’.” “Oh, never mind said, Jim. That way always talks. Give Me bucket—I gone minute. _She_ ever know.” “Oh, I dare not, Mars Tom. Ole missis would take an’ tar de head off’n me. ’Deed would.” “_She_! She never licks anybody—whacks head thimble—and cares that, I would like know. She talks awful, talk hurt—anyways cry. Jim, I give marvel. I give white alley!” Jim began waver. “White alley, Jim! And bully taw.” “My! Dat’s mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I’s powerful ’fraid ole missis—” “And besides, I show sore toe.” Jim human—this attraction much him. He put pail, took white alley, bent toe absorbing interest bandage unwound. In another moment flying street pail tingling rear, Tom whitewashing vigor, Aunt Polly retiring field slipper hand triumph eye. But Tom’s energy last. He began think fun planned day, sorrows multiplied. Soon free boys would come tripping along sorts delicious expeditions, would make world fun work—the thought burnt like fire. He got worldly wealth examined it—bits toys, marbles, trash; enough buy exchange _work_, maybe, half enough buy much half hour pure freedom. So returned straitened means pocket, gave idea trying buy boys. At dark hopeless moment inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less great, magnificent inspiration. He took brush went tranquilly work. Ben Rogers hove sight presently—the boy, boys, whose ridicule dreading. Ben’s gait hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough heart light anticipations high. He eating apple, giving long, melodious whoop, intervals, followed deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, personating steamboat. As drew near, slackened speed, took middle street, leaned far starboard rounded ponderously laborious pomp circumstance—for personating Big Missouri, considered drawing nine feet water. He boat captain engine-bells combined, imagine standing hurricane-deck giving orders executing them: “Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out, drew slowly toward sidewalk. “Ship back! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms straightened stiffened sides. “Set back stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow! Chow!” His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles—for representing forty-foot wheel. “Let go back labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!” The left hand began describe circles. “Stop stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop labboard! Come ahead stabboard! Stop her! Let outside turn slow! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get head-line! _lively_ now! Come—out spring-line—what there! Take turn round stump bight it! Stand stage, now—let go! Done engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH’T! S’H’T! SH’T!” (trying gauge-cocks). Tom went whitewashing—paid attention steamboat. Ben stared moment said: “_Hi-Yi! You’re_ stump, you!” No answer. Tom surveyed last touch eye artist, gave brush another gentle sweep surveyed result, before. Ben ranged alongside him. Tom’s mouth watered apple, stuck work. Ben said: “Hello, old chap, got work, hey?” Tom wheeled suddenly said: “Why, you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.” “Say—I going a-swimming, I am. Do wish could? But course would druther _work_—would you? Course would!” Tom contemplated boy bit, said: “What call work?” “Why, _that_ work?” Tom resumed whitewashing, answered carelessly: “Well, maybe is, maybe not. All I know, is, suits Tom Sawyer.” “Oh come, now, mean let _like_ it?” The brush continued move. “Like it? Well, I see I ought like it. Does boy get chance whitewash fence every day?” That put thing new light. Ben stopped nibbling apple. Tom swept brush daintily back forth—stepped back note effect—added touch there—criticised effect again—Ben watching every move getting interested, absorbed. Presently said: “Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash little.” Tom considered, consent; altered mind: “No—no—I reckon would hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful particular fence—right street, know—but back fence I would mind _she_ would not. Yes, awful particular fence; got done careful; I reckon one boy thousand, maybe two thousand, way got done.” “No—is so? Oh come, now—let try. Only little—I would let _you_, me, Tom.” “Ben, I would like to, honest injun; Aunt Polly—well, Jim wanted it, would let him; Sid wanted it, would let Sid. Now see I fixed? If tackle fence anything happen it—” “Oh, shucks, I careful. Now let try. Say—I give core apple.” “Well, here—No, Ben, not. I afeard—” “I give _all_ it!” Tom gave brush reluctance face, alacrity heart. And late steamer Big Missouri worked sweated sun, retired artist sat barrel shade close by, dangled legs, munched apple, planned slaughter innocents. There lack material; boys happened along every little while; came jeer, remained whitewash. By time Ben fagged out, Tom traded next chance Billy Fisher kite, good repair; played out, Johnny Miller bought dead rat string swing with—and on, on, hour hour. And middle afternoon came, poor poverty-stricken boy morning, Tom literally rolling wealth. He besides things mentioned, twelve marbles, part jews-harp, piece blue bottle-glass look through, spool cannon, key would unlock anything, fragment chalk, glass stopper decanter, tin soldier, couple tadpoles, six fire-crackers, kitten one eye, brass door-knob, dog-collar—but dog—the handle knife, four pieces orange-peel, dilapidated old window sash. He nice, good, idle time while—plenty company—and fence three coats whitewash it! If run whitewash would bankrupted every boy village. Tom said hollow world, all. He discovered great law human action, without knowing it—namely, order make man boy covet thing, necessary make thing difficult attain. If great wise philosopher, like writer book, would comprehended Work consists whatever body _obliged_ do, Play consists whatever body obliged do. And would help understand constructing artificial flowers performing tread-mill work, rolling ten-pins climbing Mont Blanc amusement. There wealthy gentlemen England drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty thirty miles daily line, summer, privilege costs considerable money; offered wages service, would turn work would resign. The boy mused awhile substantial change taken place worldly circumstances, wended toward headquarters report. CHAPTER III TOM presented Aunt Polly, sitting open window pleasant rearward apartment, bedroom, breakfast-room, dining-room, library, combined. The balmy summer air, restful quiet, odor flowers, drowsing murmur bees effect, nodding knitting—for company cat, asleep lap. Her spectacles propped gray head safety. She thought course Tom deserted long ago, wondered seeing place power intrepid way. He said: “May I go play now, aunt?” “What, a’ready? How much done?” “It done, aunt.” “Tom, lie me—I cannot bear it.” “I not, aunt; _is_ done.” Aunt Polly placed small trust evidence. She went see herself; would content find twenty per cent. Tom’s statement true. When found entire fence white-washed, whitewashed elaborately coated recoated, even streak added ground, astonishment almost unspeakable. She said: “Well, I never! There getting round it, work mind to, Tom.” And diluted compliment adding, “But powerful seldom mind to, I bound say. Well, go ’long play; mind get back time week, I tan you.” She overcome splendor achievement took closet selected choice apple delivered him, along improving lecture upon added value flavor treat took came without sin virtuous effort. And closed happy Scriptural flourish, “hooked” doughnut. Then skipped out, saw Sid starting outside stairway led back rooms second floor. Clods handy air full twinkling. They raged around Sid like hail-storm; Aunt Polly could collect surprised faculties sally rescue, six seven clods taken personal effect, Tom fence gone. There gate, general thing crowded time make use it. His soul peace, settled Sid calling attention black thread getting trouble. Tom skirted block, came round muddy alley led back aunt’s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond reach capture punishment, hastened toward public square village, two “military” companies boys met conflict, according previous appointment. Tom General one armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General other. These two great commanders condescend fight person—that better suited still smaller fry—but sat together eminence conducted field operations orders delivered aides-de-camp. Tom’s army great victory, long hard-fought battle. Then dead counted, prisoners exchanged, terms next disagreement agreed upon, day necessary battle appointed; armies fell line marched away, Tom turned homeward alone. As passing house Jeff Thatcher lived, saw new girl garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature yellow hair plaited two long-tails, white summer frock embroidered pan-talettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished heart left even memory behind. He thought loved distraction; regarded passion adoration; behold poor little evanescent partiality. He months winning her; confessed hardly week ago; happiest proudest boy world seven short days, one instant time gone heart like casual stranger whose visit done. He worshipped new angel furtive eye, till saw discovered him; pretended know present, began “show off” sorts absurd boyish ways, order win admiration. He kept grotesque foolishness time; by-and-by, midst dangerous gymnastic performances, glanced aside saw little girl wending way toward house. Tom came fence leaned it, grieving, hoping would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted moment steps moved toward door. Tom heaved great sigh put foot threshold. But face lit up, right away, tossed pansy fence moment disappeared. The boy ran around stopped within foot two flower, shaded eyes hand began look street discovered something interest going direction. Presently picked straw began trying balance nose, head tilted far back; moved side side, efforts, edged nearer nearer toward pansy; finally bare foot rested upon it, pliant toes closed upon it, hopped away treasure disappeared round corner. But minute—only could button flower inside jacket, next heart—or next stomach, possibly, much posted anatomy, hypercritical, anyway. He returned, now, hung fence till nightfall, “showing off,” before; girl never exhibited again, though Tom comforted little hope near window, meantime, aware attentions. Finally strode home reluctantly, poor head full visions. All supper spirits high aunt wondered “what got child.” He took good scolding clodding Sid, seem mind least. He tried steal sugar aunt’s nose, got knuckles rapped it. He said: “Aunt, whack Sid takes it.” “Well, Sid torment body way do. You would always sugar I warn’t watching you.” Presently stepped kitchen, Sid, happy immunity, reached sugar-bowl—a sort glorying Tom wellnigh unbearable. But Sid’s fingers slipped bowl dropped broke. Tom ecstasies. In ecstasies even controlled tongue silent. He said would speak word, even aunt came in, would sit perfectly still till asked mischief; would tell, would nothing good world see pet model “catch it.” He brimful exultation could hardly hold old lady came back stood wreck discharging lightnings wrath spectacles. He said himself, “Now coming!” And next instant sprawling floor! The potent palm uplifted strike Tom cried out: “Hold on, now, ’er belting _me_ for?—Sid broke it!” Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, Tom looked healing pity. But got tongue again, said: “Umf! Well, get lick amiss, I reckon. You audacious mischief I around, like enough.” Then conscience reproached her, yearned say something kind loving; judged would construed confession wrong, discipline forbade that. So kept silence, went affairs troubled heart. Tom sulked corner exalted woes. He knew heart aunt knees him, morosely gratified consciousness it. He would hang signals, would take notice none. He knew yearning glance fell upon him, then, film tears, refused recognition it. He pictured lying sick unto death aunt bending beseeching one little forgiving word, would turn face wall, die word unsaid. Ah, would feel then? And pictured brought home river, dead, curls wet, sore heart rest. How would throw upon him, tears would fall like rain, lips pray God give back boy would never, never abuse more! But would lie cold white make sign—a poor little sufferer, whose griefs end. He worked upon feelings pathos dreams, keep swallowing, like choke; eyes swam blur water, overflowed winked, ran trickled end nose. And luxury petting sorrows, could bear worldly cheeriness grating delight intrude upon it; sacred contact; so, presently, cousin Mary danced in, alive joy seeing home age-long visit one week country, got moved clouds darkness one door brought song sunshine other. He wandered far accustomed haunts boys, sought desolate places harmony spirit. A log raft river invited him, seated outer edge contemplated dreary vastness stream, wishing, while, could drowned, unconsciously, without undergoing uncomfortable routine devised nature. Then thought flower. He got out, rumpled wilted, mightily increased dismal felicity. He wondered would pity knew? Would cry, wish right put arms around neck comfort him? Or would turn coldly away like hollow world? This picture brought agony pleasurable suffering worked mind set new varied lights, till wore threadbare. At last rose sighing departed darkness. About half-past nine ten clock came along deserted street Adored Unknown lived; paused moment; sound fell upon listening ear; candle casting dull glow upon curtain second-story window. Was sacred presence there? He climbed fence, threaded stealthy way plants, till stood window; looked long, emotion; laid ground it, disposing upon back, hands clasped upon breast holding poor wilted flower. And thus would die—out cold world, shelter homeless head, friendly hand wipe death-damps brow, loving face bend pityingly great agony came. And thus _she_ would see looked upon glad morning, oh! would drop one little tear upon poor, lifeless form, would heave one little sigh see bright young life rudely blighted, untimely cut down? The window went up, maid-servant’s discordant voice profaned holy calm, deluge water drenched prone martyr’s remains! The strangling hero sprang relieving snort. There whiz missile air, mingled murmur curse, sound shivering glass followed, small, vague form went fence shot away gloom. Not long after, Tom, undressed bed, surveying drenched garments light tallow dip, Sid woke up; dim idea making “references allusions,” thought better held peace, danger Tom’s eye. Tom turned without added vexation prayers, Sid made mental note omission. CHAPTER IV THE sun rose upon tranquil world, beamed upon peaceful village like benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly family worship: began prayer built ground solid courses Scriptural quotations, welded together thin mortar originality; summit delivered grim chapter Mosaic Law, Sinai. Then Tom girded loins, speak, went work “get verses.” Sid learned lesson days before. Tom bent energies memorizing five verses, chose part Sermon Mount, could find verses shorter. At end half hour Tom vague general idea lesson, more, mind traversing whole field human thought, hands busy distracting recreations. Mary took book hear recite, tried find way fog: “Blessed the—a—a—” “Poor”— “Yes—poor; blessed poor—a—a—” “In spirit—” “In spirit; blessed poor spirit, they—they—” “_Theirs_—” “For _theirs_. Blessed poor spirit, kingdom heaven. Blessed mourn, they—they—” “Sh—” “For they—a—” “S, H, A—” “For S, H—Oh, I know is!” “_Shall_!” “Oh, _shall_! shall—for shall—a—a—shall mourn—a—a—blessed shall—they that—a—they shall mourn, shall—a—shall _what_? Why tell me, Mary?—what want mean for?” “Oh, Tom, poor thick-headed thing, I teasing you. I would that. You must go learn again. Do discouraged, Tom, manage it—and do, I give something ever nice. There, now, good boy.” “All right! What it, Mary, tell is.” “Never mind, Tom. You know I say nice, nice.” “You bet so, Mary. All right, I tackle again.” And “tackle again”—and double pressure curiosity prospective gain spirit accomplished shining success. Mary gave brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve half cents; convulsion delight swept system shook foundations. True, knife would cut anything, “sure-enough” Barlow, inconceivable grandeur that—though Western boys ever got idea weapon could possibly counterfeited injury imposing mystery always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived scarify cupboard it, arranging begin bureau, called dress Sunday-school. Mary gave tin basin water piece soap, went outside door set basin little bench there; dipped soap water laid down; turned sleeves; poured water ground, gently, entered kitchen began wipe face diligently towel behind door. But Mary removed towel said: “Now ashamed, Tom. You must bad. Water hurt you.” Tom trifle disconcerted. The basin refilled, time stood little while, gathering resolution; took big breath began. When entered kitchen presently, eyes shut groping towel hands, honorable testimony suds water dripping face. But emerged towel, yet satisfactory, clean territory stopped short chin jaws, like mask; beyond line dark expanse unirrigated soil spread downward front backward around neck. Mary took hand, done man brother, without distinction color, saturated hair neatly brushed, short curls wrought dainty symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed curls, labor difficulty, plastered hair close head; held curls effeminate, filled life bitterness.] Then Mary got suit clothing used Sundays two years—they simply called “other clothes”—and know size wardrobe. The girl “put rights” dressed himself; buttoned neat roundabout chin, turned vast shirt collar shoulders, brushed crowned speckled straw hat. He looked exceedingly improved uncomfortable. He fully uncomfortable looked; restraint whole clothes cleanliness galled him. He hoped Mary would forget shoes, hope blighted; coated thoroughly tallow, custom, brought out. He lost temper said always made everything want do. But Mary said, persuasively: “Please, Tom—that good boy.” So got shoes snarling. Mary soon ready, three children set Sunday-school—a place Tom hated whole heart; Sid Mary fond it. Sabbath-school hours nine half-past ten; church service. Two children always remained sermon voluntarily, always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat three hundred persons; edifice small, plain affair, sort pine board tree-box top steeple. At door Tom dropped back step accosted Sunday-dressed comrade: “Say, Billy, got yaller ticket?” “Yes.” “What take her?” “What give?” “Piece lickrish fish-hook.” “Less see them.” Tom exhibited. They satisfactory, property changed hands. Then Tom traded couple white alleys three red tickets, small trifle couple blue ones. He waylaid boys came, went buying tickets various colors ten fifteen minutes longer. He entered church, now, swarm clean noisy boys girls, proceeded seat started quarrel first boy came handy. The teacher, grave, elderly man, interfered; turned back moment Tom pulled boy’s hair next bench, absorbed book boy turned around; stuck pin another boy, presently, order hear say “Ouch!” got new reprimand teacher. Tom’s whole class pattern—restless, noisy, troublesome. When came recite lessons, one knew verses perfectly, prompted along. However, worried through, got reward—in small blue tickets, passage Scripture it; blue ticket pay two verses recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled red one, could exchanged it; ten red tickets equalled yellow one; ten yellow tickets superintendent gave plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents easy times) pupil. How many readers would industry application memorize two thousand verses, even Dore Bible? And yet Mary acquired two Bibles way—it patient work two years—and boy German parentage four five. He recited three thousand verses without stopping; strain upon mental faculties great, little better idiot day forth—a grievous misfortune school, great occasions, company, superintendent (as Tom expressed it) always made boy come “spread himself.” Only older pupils managed keep tickets stick tedious work long enough get Bible, delivery one prizes rare noteworthy circumstance; successful pupil great conspicuous day spot every scholar’s heart fired fresh ambition often lasted couple weeks. It possible Tom’s mental stomach never really hungered one prizes, unquestionably entire many day longed glory eclat came it. In due course superintendent stood front pulpit, closed hymn-book hand forefinger inserted leaves, commanded attention. When Sunday-school superintendent makes customary little speech, hymn-book hand necessary inevitable sheet music hand singer stands forward platform sings solo concert—though why, mystery: neither hymn-book sheet music ever referred sufferer. This superintendent slim creature thirty-five, sandy goatee short sandy hair; wore stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached ears whose sharp points curved forward abreast corners mouth—a fence compelled straight lookout ahead, turning whole body side view required; chin propped spreading cravat broad long bank-note, fringed ends; boot toes turned sharply up, fashion day, like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently laboriously produced young men sitting toes pressed wall hours together. Mr. Walters earnest mien, sincere honest heart; held sacred things places reverence, separated worldly matters, unconsciously Sunday-school voice acquired peculiar intonation wholly absent week-days. He began fashion: “Now, children, I want sit straight pretty give attention minute two. There—that it. That way good little boys girls do. I see one little girl looking window—I afraid thinks I somewhere—perhaps one trees making speech little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want tell good makes feel see many bright, clean little faces assembled place like this, learning right good.” And forth on. It necessary set rest oration. It pattern vary, familiar us all. The latter third speech marred resumption fights recreations among certain bad boys, fidgetings whisperings extended far wide, washing even bases isolated incorruptible rocks like Sid Mary. But every sound ceased suddenly, subsidence Mr. Walters’ voice, conclusion speech received burst silent gratitude. A good part whispering occasioned event less rare—the entrance visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied feeble aged man; fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman iron-gray hair; dignified lady doubtless latter’s wife. The lady leading child. Tom restless full chafings repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could meet Amy Lawrence’s eye, could brook loving gaze. But saw small newcomer soul ablaze bliss moment. The next moment “showing off” might—cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces—in word, using every art seemed likely fascinate girl win applause. His exaltation one alloy—the memory humiliation angel’s garden—and record sand fast washing out, waves happiness sweeping now. The visitors given highest seat honor, soon Mr. Walters’ speech finished, introduced school. The middle-aged man turned prodigious personage—no less one county judge—altogether august creation children ever looked upon—and wondered kind material made of—and half wanted hear roar, half afraid might, too. He Constantinople, twelve miles away—so travelled, seen world—these eyes looked upon county court-house—which said tin roof. The awe reflections inspired attested impressive silence ranks staring eyes. This great Judge Thatcher, brother lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, familiar great man envied school. It would music soul hear whisperings: “Look him, Jim! He going there. Say—look! going shake hands him—he _is_ shaking hands him! By jings, wish Jeff?” Mr. Walters fell “showing off,” sorts official bustlings activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there, everywhere could find target. The librarian “showed off”—running hither thither arms full books making deal splutter fuss insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers “showed off”—bending sweetly pupils lately boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers bad little boys patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers “showed off” small scoldings little displays authority fine attention discipline—and teachers, sexes, found business library, pulpit; business frequently done two three times (with much seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” various ways, little boys “showed off” diligence air thick paper wads murmur scufflings. And great man sat beamed majestic judicial smile upon house, warmed sun grandeur—for “showing off,” too. There one thing wanting make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete, chance deliver Bible-prize exhibit prodigy. Several pupils yellow tickets, none enough—he around among star pupils inquiring. He would given worlds, now, German lad back sound mind. And moment, hope dead, Tom Sawyer came forward nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, ten blue ones, demanded Bible. This thunderbolt clear sky. Walters expecting application source next ten years. But getting around it—here certified checks, good face. Tom therefore elevated place Judge elect, great news announced headquarters. It stunning surprise decade, profound sensation lifted new hero judicial one’s altitude, school two marvels gaze upon place one. The boys eaten envy—but suffered bitterest pangs perceived late contributed hated splendor trading tickets Tom wealth amassed selling whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, dupes wily fraud, guileful snake grass. The prize delivered Tom much effusion superintendent could pump circumstances; lacked somewhat true gush, poor fellow’s instinct taught mystery could well bear light, perhaps; simply preposterous boy warehoused two thousand sheaves Scriptural wisdom premises—a dozen would strain capacity, without doubt. Amy Lawrence proud glad, tried make Tom see face—but would look. She wondered; grain troubled; next dim suspicion came went—came again; watched; furtive glance told worlds—and heart broke, jealous, angry, tears came hated everybody. Tom (she thought). Tom introduced Judge; tongue tied, breath would hardly come, heart quaked—partly awful greatness man, mainly parent. He would liked fall worship him, dark. The Judge put hand Tom’s head called fine little man, asked name was. The boy stammered, gasped, got out: “Tom.” “Oh, no, Tom—it is—” “Thomas.” “Ah, it. I thought it, maybe. That well. But another one I daresay, tell me, you?” “Tell gentleman name, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say sir. You must forget manners.” “Thomas Sawyer—sir.” “That it! That good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two thousand verses great many—very, great many. And never sorry trouble took learn them; knowledge worth anything world; makes great men good men; great man good man yourself, day, Thomas, look back say, It owing precious Sunday-school privileges boyhood—it owing dear teachers taught learn—it owing good superintendent, encouraged me, watched me, gave beautiful Bible—a splendid elegant Bible—to keep own, always—it owing right bringing up! That say, Thomas—and would take money two thousand verses—no indeed would not. And would mind telling lady things learned—no, I know would not—for proud little boys learn. Now, doubt know names twelve disciples. Will tell us names first two appointed?” Tom tugging button-hole looking sheepish. He blushed, now, eyes fell. Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. He said himself, possible boy answer simplest question—why _did_ Judge ask him? Yet felt obliged speak say: “Answer gentleman, Thomas—do afraid.” Tom still hung fire. “Now I know tell me,” said lady. “The names first two disciples were—” “_David And Goliah!_” Let us draw curtain charity rest scene. CHAPTER V ABOUT half-past ten cracked bell small church began ring, presently people began gather morning sermon. The Sunday-school children distributed house occupied pews parents, supervision. Aunt Polly came, Tom Sid Mary sat her—Tom placed next aisle, order might far away open window seductive outside summer scenes possible. The crowd filed aisles: aged needy postmaster, seen better days; mayor wife—for mayor there, among unnecessaries; justice peace; widow Douglas, fair, smart, forty, generous, good-hearted soul well-to-do, hill mansion palace town, hospitable much lavish matter festivities St. Petersburg could boast; bent venerable Major Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, new notable distance; next belle village, followed troop lawn-clad ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; young clerks town body—for stood vestibule sucking cane-heads, circling wall oiled simpering admirers, till last girl run gantlet; last came Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking heedful care mother cut glass. He always brought mother church, pride matrons. The boys hated him, good. And besides, “thrown them” much. His white handkerchief hanging pocket behind, usual Sundays—accidentally. Tom handkerchief, looked upon boys snobs. The congregation fully assembled, now, bell rang more, warn laggards stragglers, solemn hush fell upon church broken tittering whispering choir gallery. The choir always tittered whispered service. There church choir ill-bred, I forgotten was, now. It great many years ago, I scarcely remember anything it, I think foreign country. The minister gave hymn, read relish, peculiar style much admired part country. His voice began medium key climbed steadily till reached certain point, bore strong emphasis upon topmost word plunged spring-board: Shall I car-ri-ed toe skies, flow’ry _beds_ ease, Whilst others fight win prize, sail thro’ _blood_-y seas? He regarded wonderful reader. At church “sociables” always called upon read poetry; through, ladies would lift hands let fall helplessly laps, “wall” eyes, shake heads, much say, “Words cannot express it; beautiful, TOO beautiful mortal earth.” After hymn sung, Rev. Mr. Sprague turned bulletin-board, read “notices” meetings societies things till seemed list would stretch crack doom—a queer custom still kept America, even cities, away age abundant newspapers. Often, less justify traditional custom, harder get rid it. And minister prayed. A good, generous prayer was, went details: pleaded church, little children church; churches village; village itself; county; State; State officers; United States; churches United States; Congress; President; officers Government; poor sailors, tossed stormy seas; oppressed millions groaning heel European monarchies Oriental despotisms; light good tidings, yet eyes see ears hear withal; heathen far islands sea; closed supplication words speak might find grace favor, seed sown fertile ground, yielding time grateful harvest good. Amen. There rustling dresses, standing congregation sat down. The boy whose history book relates enjoy prayer, endured it—if even much. He restive it; kept tally details prayer, unconsciously—for listening, knew ground old, clergyman’s regular route it—and little trifle new matter interlarded, ear detected whole nature resented it; considered additions unfair, scoundrelly. In midst prayer fly lit back pew front tortured spirit calmly rubbing hands together, embracing head arms, polishing vigorously seemed almost part company body, slender thread neck exposed view; scraping wings hind legs smoothing body coat-tails; going whole toilet tranquilly knew perfectly safe. As indeed was; sorely Tom’s hands itched grab dare—he believed soul would instantly destroyed thing prayer going on. But closing sentence hand began curve steal forward; instant “Amen” fly prisoner war. His aunt detected act made let go. The minister gave text droned along monotonously argument prosy many head began nod—and yet argument dealt limitless fire brimstone thinned predestined elect company small hardly worth saving. Tom counted pages sermon; church always knew many pages been, seldom knew anything else discourse. However, time really interested little while. The minister made grand moving picture assembling together world’s hosts millennium lion lamb lie together little child lead them. But pathos, lesson, moral great spectacle lost upon boy; thought conspicuousness principal character on-looking nations; face lit thought, said wished could child, tame lion. Now lapsed suffering again, dry argument resumed. Presently bethought treasure got out. It large black beetle formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” called it. It percussion-cap box. The first thing beetle take finger. A natural fillip followed, beetle went floundering aisle lit back, hurt finger went boy’s mouth. The beetle lay working helpless legs, unable turn over. Tom eyed it, longed it; safe reach. Other people uninterested sermon found relief beetle, eyed too. Presently vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad heart, lazy summer softness quiet, weary captivity, sighing change. He spied beetle; drooping tail lifted wagged. He surveyed prize; walked around it; smelt safe distance; walked around again; grew bolder, took closer smell; lifted lip made gingerly snatch it, missing it; made another, another; began enjoy diversion; subsided stomach beetle paws, continued experiments; grew weary last, indifferent absent-minded. His head nodded, little little chin descended touched enemy, seized it. There sharp yelp, flirt poodle’s head, beetle fell couple yards away, lit back more. The neighboring spectators shook gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans hand-kerchiefs, Tom entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, probably felt so; resentment heart, too, craving revenge. So went beetle began wary attack again; jumping every point circle, lighting fore-paws within inch creature, making even closer snatches teeth, jerking head till ears flapped again. But grew tired more, while; tried amuse fly found relief; followed ant around, nose close floor, quickly wearied that; yawned, sighed, forgot beetle entirely, sat it. Then wild yelp agony poodle went sailing aisle; yelps continued, dog; crossed house front altar; flew aisle; crossed doors; clamored home-stretch; anguish grew progress, till presently woolly comet moving orbit gleam speed light. At last frantic sufferer sheered course, sprang master’s lap; flung window, voice distress quickly thinned away died distance. By time whole church red-faced suffocating suppressed laughter, sermon come dead standstill. The discourse resumed presently, went lame halting, possibility impressiveness end; even gravest sentiments constantly received smothered burst unholy mirth, cover remote pew-back, poor parson said rarely facetious thing. It genuine relief whole congregation ordeal benediction pronounced. Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking satisfaction divine service bit variety it. He one marring thought; willing dog play pinchbug, think upright carry off. CHAPTER VI MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found so—because began another week’s slow suffering school. He generally began day wishing intervening holiday, made going captivity fetters much odious. Tom lay thinking. Presently occurred wished sick; could stay home school. Here vague possibility. He canvassed system. No ailment found, investigated again. This time thought could detect colicky symptoms, began encourage considerable hope. But soon grew feeble, presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly discovered something. One upper front teeth loose. This lucky; begin groan, “starter,” called it, occurred came court argument, aunt would pull out, would hurt. So thought would hold tooth reserve present, seek further. Nothing offered little time, remembered hearing doctor tell certain thing laid patient two three weeks threatened make lose finger. So boy eagerly drew sore toe sheet held inspection. But know necessary symptoms. However, seemed well worth chance it, fell groaning considerable spirit. But Sid slept unconscious. Tom groaned louder, fancied began feel pain toe. No result Sid. Tom panting exertions time. He took rest swelled fetched succession admirable groans. Sid snored on. Tom aggravated. He said, “Sid, Sid!” shook him. This course worked well, Tom began groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, brought elbow snort, began stare Tom. Tom went groaning. Sid said: “Tom! Say, Tom!” [No response.] “Here, Tom! TOM! What matter, Tom?” And shook looked face anxiously. Tom moaned out: “Oh, not, Sid. Do joggle me.” “Why, matter, Tom? I must call auntie.” “No—never mind. It by, maybe. Do call anybody.” “But I must! _Don’t_ groan so, Tom, awful. How long way?” “Hours. Ouch! Oh, stir so, Sid, kill me.” “Tom, wake sooner? Oh, Tom, _don’t!_ It makes flesh crawl hear you. Tom, matter?” “I forgive everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything ever done me. When I gone—” “Oh, Tom, dying, you? Do not, Tom—oh, not. Maybe—” “I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell so, Sid. And Sid, give window-sash cat one eye new girl come town, tell her—” But Sid snatched clothes gone. Tom suffering reality, now, handsomely imagination working, groans gathered quite genuine tone. Sid flew downstairs said: “Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom’s dying!” “Dying!” “Yes’m. Do wait—come quick!” “Rubbage! I believe it!” But fled upstairs, nevertheless, Sid Mary heels. And face grew white, too, lip trembled. When reached bedside gasped out: “You, Tom! Tom, matter you?” “Oh, auntie, I am—” “What matter you—what matter you, child?” “Oh, auntie, sore toe’s mortified!” The old lady sank chair laughed little, cried little, together. This restored said: “Tom, turn give me. Now shut nonsense climb this.” The groans ceased pain vanished toe. The boy felt little foolish, said: “Aunt Polly, _seemed_ mortified, hurt I never minded tooth all.” “Your tooth, indeed! What matter tooth?” “One them’s loose, aches perfectly awful.” “There, there, now, begin groaning again. Open mouth. Well—your tooth _is_ loose, going die that. Mary, get silk thread, chunk fire kitchen.” Tom said: “Oh, please, auntie, pull out. It hurt more. I wish I may never stir does. Please not, auntie. I want stay home school.” “Oh, not, you? So row thought would get stay home school go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love so, seem try every way break old heart outrageousness.” By time dental instruments ready. The old lady made one end silk thread fast Tom’s tooth loop tied bedpost. Then seized chunk fire suddenly thrust almost boy’s face. The tooth hung dangling bedpost, now. But trials bring compensations. As Tom wended school breakfast, envy every boy met gap upper row teeth enabled expectorate new admirable way. He gathered quite following lads interested exhibition; one cut finger centre fascination homage time, found suddenly without adherent, shorn glory. His heart heavy, said disdain feel anything spit like Tom Sawyer; another boy said, “Sour grapes!” wandered away dismantled hero. Shortly Tom came upon juvenile pariah village, Huckleberry Finn, son town drunkard. Huckleberry cordially hated dreaded mothers town, idle lawless vulgar bad—and children admired so, delighted forbidden society, wished dared like him. Tom like rest respectable boys, envied Huckleberry gaudy outcast condition, strict orders play him. So played every time got chance. Huckleberry always dressed cast-off clothes full-grown men, perennial bloom fluttering rags. His hat vast ruin wide crescent lopped brim; coat, wore one, hung nearly heels rearward buttons far back; one suspender supported trousers; seat trousers bagged low contained nothing, fringed legs dragged dirt rolled up. Huckleberry came went, free will. He slept doorsteps fine weather empty hogsheads wet; go school church, call master obey anybody; could go fishing swimming chose, stay long suited him; nobody forbade fight; could sit late pleased; always first boy went barefoot spring last resume leather fall; never wash, put clean clothes; could swear wonderfully. In word, everything goes make life precious boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy St. Petersburg. Tom hailed romantic outcast: “Hello, Huckleberry!” “Hello yourself, see like it.” “What got?” “Dead cat.” “Let Me see him, Huck. My, pretty stiff. Where get him?” “Bought off’n boy.” “What give?” “I give blue ticket bladder I got slaughter-house.” “Where get blue ticket?” “Bought off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago hoop-stick.” “Say—what dead cats good for, Huck?” “Good for? Cure warts with.” “No! Is so? I know something better.” “I bet not. What it?” “Why, spunk-water.” “Spunk-water! I would give dern spunk-water.” “You would not, would you? D’you ever try it?” “No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.” “Who told so!” “Why, told Jeff Thatcher, Jeff told Johnny Baker, Johnny told Jim Hollis, Jim told Ben Rogers, Ben told nigger, nigger told me. There now!” “Well, it? They lie. Leastways nigger. I know _him_. But I never see nigger _wouldn’t_ lie. Shucks! Now tell Bob Tanner done it, Huck.” “Why, took dipped hand rotten stump rain-water was.” “In daytime?” “Certainly.” “With face stump?” “Yes. Least I reckon so.” “Did say anything?” “I reckon did. I know.” “Aha! Talk trying cure warts spunk-water blame fool way that! Why, a-going good. You got go yourself, middle woods, know spunk-water stump, midnight back stump jam hand say: ‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller warts,’ walk away quick, eleven steps, eyes shut, turn around three times walk home without speaking anybody. Because speak charm’s busted.” “Well, sounds like good way; way Bob Tanner done.” “No, sir, bet not, becuz wartiest boy town; would wart would knowed work spunk-water. I took thousands warts hands way, Huck. I play frogs much I always got considerable many warts. Sometimes I take bean.” “Yes, bean’s good. I done that.” “Have you? What way?” “You take split bean, cut wart get blood, put blood one piece bean take dig hole bury ’bout midnight crossroads dark moon, burn rest bean. You see piece got blood keep drawing drawing, trying fetch piece it, helps blood draw wart, pretty soon comes.” “Yes, it, Huck—that it; though burying say ‘Down bean; wart; come bother me!’ better. That way Joe Harper does, nearly Coonville everywheres. But say—how cure dead cats?” “Why, take cat go get grave-yard ’long midnight somebody wicked buried; midnight devil come, maybe two three, cannot see them, hear something like wind, maybe hear talk; taking feller away, heave cat say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I done ye!’ That fetch _any_ wart.” “Sounds right. D’you ever try it, Huck?” “No, old Mother Hopkins told me.” “Well, I reckon so, then. Becuz say witch.” “Say! Why, Tom, I _know_ is. She witched pap. Pap says self. He come along one day, see a-witching him, took rock, dodged, would got her. Well, night rolled off’n would wher’ layin drunk, broke arm.” “Why, awful. How know a-witching him?” “Lord, pap tell, easy. Pap says keep looking right stiddy, a-witching you. Specially mumble. Becuz mumble saying Lord’s Prayer backards.” “Say, Hucky, going try cat?” “To-night. I reckon come old Hoss Williams to-night.” “But buried Saturday. Did get Saturday night?” “Why, talk! How could charms work till midnight?—and _then_ Sunday. Devils slosh around much Sunday, I reckon.” “I never thought that. That so. Let Me go you?” “Of course—if afeard.” “Afeard! ’Tain’t likely. Will meow?” “Yes—and meow back, get chance. Last time, kep’ a-meowing around till old Hays went throwing rocks says ‘Dern cat!’ I hove brick window—but tell.” “I not. I could meow night, becuz auntie watching me, I meow time. Say—what that?” “Nothing tick.” “Where get him?” “Out woods.” “What take him?” “I know. I want sell him.” “All right. It mighty small tick, anyway.” “Oh, anybody run tick belong them. I satisfied it. It good enough tick me.” “Sho, ticks plenty. I could thousand I wanted to.” “Well, you? Becuz know mighty well cannot. This pretty early tick, I reckon. It first one I seen year.” “Say, Huck—I give tooth him.” “Less see it.” Tom got bit paper carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed wistfully. The temptation strong. At last said: “Is genuwyne?” Tom lifted lip showed vacancy. “Well, right,” said Huckleberry, “it trade.” Tom enclosed tick percussion-cap box lately pinchbug’s prison, boys separated, feeling wealthier before. When Tom reached little isolated frame school-house, strode briskly, manner one come honest speed. He hung hat peg flung seat business-like alacrity. The master, throned high great splint-bottom arm-chair, dozing, lulled drowsy hum study. The interruption roused him. “Thomas Sawyer!” Tom knew name pronounced full, meant trouble. “Sir!” “Come here. Now, sir, late again, usual?” Tom take refuge lie, saw two long tails yellow hair hanging back recognized electric sympathy love; form _the vacant place_ girls’ side school-house. He instantly said: “_I stopped talk Huckleberry Finn!_” The master’s pulse stood still, stared helplessly. The buzz study ceased. The pupils wondered foolhardy boy lost mind. The master said: “You—you what?” “Stopped talk Huckleberry Finn.” There mistaking words. “Thomas Sawyer, astounding confession I ever listened to. No mere ferule answer offence. Take jacket.” The master’s arm performed tired stock switches notably diminished. Then order followed: “Now, sir, go sit girls! And let warning you.” The titter rippled around room appeared abash boy, reality result caused rather worshipful awe unknown idol dread pleasure lay high good fortune. He sat upon end pine bench girl hitched away toss head. Nudges winks whispers traversed room, Tom sat still, arms upon long, low desk him, seemed study book. By attention ceased him, accustomed school murmur rose upon dull air more. Presently boy began steal furtive glances girl. She observed it, “made mouth” gave back head space minute. When cautiously faced around again, peach lay her. She thrust away. Tom gently put back. She thrust away again, less animosity. Tom patiently returned place. Then let remain. Tom scrawled slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The girl glanced words, made sign. Now boy began draw something slate, hiding work left hand. For time girl refused notice; human curiosity presently began manifest hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. The girl made sort non-committal attempt see, boy betray aware it. At last gave hesitatingly whispered: “Let see it.” Tom partly uncovered dismal caricature house two gable ends corkscrew smoke issuing chimney. Then girl’s interest began fasten upon work forgot everything else. When finished, gazed moment, whispered: “It nice—make man.” The artist erected man front yard, resembled derrick. He could stepped house; girl hypercritical; satisfied monster, whispered: “It beautiful man—now make coming along.” Tom drew hour-glass full moon straw limbs armed spreading fingers portentous fan. The girl said: “It ever nice—I wish I could draw.” “It easy,” whispered Tom, “I learn you.” “Oh, you? When?” “At noon. Do go home dinner?” “I stay will.” “Good—that whack. What name?” “Becky Thatcher. What yours? Oh, I know. It Thomas Sawyer.” “That name lick by. I Tom I good. You call Tom, you?” “Yes.” Now Tom began scrawl something slate, hiding words girl. But backward time. She begged see. Tom said: “Oh, anything.” “Yes is.” “No not. You want see.” “Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.” “You tell.” “No I not—deed deed double deed not.” “You tell anybody all? Ever, long live?” “No, I ever tell _any_body. Now let me.” “Oh, _you_ want see!” “Now treat so, I _will_ see.” And put small hand upon little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending resist earnest letting hand slip degrees till words revealed: “_I love you_.” “Oh, bad thing!” And hit hand smart rap, reddened looked pleased, nevertheless. Just juncture boy felt slow, fateful grip closing ear, steady lifting impulse. In wise borne across house deposited seat, peppering fire giggles whole school. Then master stood awful moments, finally moved away throne without saying word. But although Tom’s ear tingled, heart jubilant. As school quieted Tom made honest effort study, turmoil within great. In turn took place reading class made botch it; geography class turned lakes mountains, mountains rivers, rivers continents, till chaos come again; spelling class, got “turned down,” succession mere baby words, till brought foot yielded pewter medal worn ostentation months. CHAPTER VII THE harder Tom tried fasten mind book, ideas wandered. So last, sigh yawn, gave up. It seemed noon recess would never come. The air utterly dead. There breath stirring. It sleepiest sleepy days. The drowsing murmur five twenty studying scholars soothed soul like spell murmur bees. Away flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted soft green sides shimmering veil heat, tinted purple distance; birds floated lazy wing high air; living thing visible cows, asleep. Tom’s heart ached free, else something interest pass dreary time. His hand wandered pocket face lit glow gratitude prayer, though know it. Then furtively percussion-cap box came out. He released tick put long flat desk. The creature probably glowed gratitude amounted prayer, too, moment, premature: started thankfully travel off, Tom turned aside pin made take new direction. Tom’s bosom friend sat next him, suffering Tom been, deeply gratefully interested entertainment instant. This bosom friend Joe Harper. The two boys sworn friends week, embattled enemies Saturdays. Joe took pin lapel began assist exercising prisoner. The sport grew interest momently. Soon Tom said interfering other, neither getting fullest benefit tick. So put Joe’s slate desk drew line middle top bottom. “Now,” said he, “as long side stir I let alone; let get away get side, leave alone long I keep crossing over.” “All right, go ahead; start up.” The tick escaped Tom, presently, crossed equator. Joe harassed awhile, got away crossed back again. This change base occurred often. While one boy worrying tick absorbing interest, would look interest strong, two heads bowed together slate, two souls dead things else. At last luck seemed settle abide Joe. The tick tried this, that, course, got excited anxious boys themselves, time would victory grasp, speak, Tom’s fingers would twitching begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head off, keep possession. At last Tom could stand longer. The temptation strong. So reached lent hand pin. Joe angry moment. Said he: “Tom, let alone.” “I want stir little, Joe.” “No, sir, fair; let alone.” “Blame it, I going stir much.” “Let alone, I tell you.” “I not!” “You shall—he side line.” “Look here, Joe Harper, whose tick?” “I care whose tick is—he side line, shall touch him.” “Well, I bet I will, though. He tick I I blame please him, die!” A tremendous whack came Tom’s shoulders, duplicate Joe’s; space two minutes dust continued fly two jackets whole school enjoy it. The boys absorbed notice hush stolen upon school awhile master came tiptoeing room stood them. He contemplated good part performance contributed bit variety it. When school broke noon, Tom flew Becky Thatcher, whispered ear: “Put bonnet let going home; get corner, give rest slip, turn lane come back. I go way come way.” So one went one group scholars, another. In little two met bottom lane, reached school themselves. Then sat together, slate them, Tom gave Becky pencil held hand his, guiding it, created another surprising house. When interest art began wane, two fell talking. Tom swimming bliss. He said: “Do love rats?” “No! I hate them!” “Well, I do, too—_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, swing round head string.” “No, I care rats much, anyway. What I like chewing-gum.” “Oh, I say so! I wish I now.” “Do you? I got some. I let chew awhile, must give back me.” That agreeable, chewed turn about, dangled legs bench excess contentment. “Was ever circus?” said Tom. “Yes, pa’s going take time, I good.” “I circus three four times—lots times. Church shucks circus. There things going circus time. I going clown circus I grow up.” “Oh, you! That nice. They lovely, spotted up.” “Yes, so. And get slathers money—most dollar day, Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, ever engaged?” “What that?” “Why, engaged married.” “No.” “Would like to?” “I reckon so. I know. What like?” “Like? Why like anything. You tell boy ever anybody him, ever ever ever, kiss all. Anybody it.” “Kiss? What kiss for?” “Why, that, know, to—well, always that.” “Everybody?” “Why, yes, everybody love other. Do remember I wrote slate?” “Ye—yes.” “What it?” “I shall tell you.” “Shall I tell _you_?” “Ye—yes—but time.” “No, now.” “No, now—to-morrow.” “Oh, no, _now_. Please, Becky—I whisper it, I whisper ever easy.” Becky hesitating, Tom took silence consent, passed arm waist whispered tale ever softly, mouth close ear. And added: “Now whisper me—just same.” She resisted, while, said: “You turn face away cannot see, I will. But must ever tell anybody—_will_ you, Tom? Now not, _will_ you?” “No, indeed, indeed I not. Now, Becky.” He turned face away. She bent timidly around till breath stirred curls whispered, “I—love—you!” Then sprang away ran around around desks benches, Tom her, took refuge corner last, little white apron face. Tom clasped neck pleaded: “Now, Becky, done—all kiss. Do afraid that—it anything all. Please, Becky.” And tugged apron hands. By gave up, let hands drop; face, glowing struggle, came submitted. Tom kissed red lips said: “Now done, Becky. And always this, know, ever love anybody me, ever marry anybody me, ever never forever. Will you?” “No, I never love anybody you, Tom, I never marry anybody you—and ever marry anybody me, either.” “Certainly. Of course. That _part_ it. And always coming school going home, walk me, anybody looking—and choose I choose parties, way engaged.” “It nice. I never heard before.” “Oh, ever gay! Why, Amy Lawrence—” The big eyes told Tom blunder stopped, confused. “Oh, Tom! Then I first ever engaged to!” The child began cry. Tom said: “Oh, cry, Becky, I care more.” “Yes, do, Tom—you know do.” Tom tried put arm neck, pushed away turned face wall, went crying. Tom tried again, soothing words mouth, repulsed again. Then pride up, strode away went outside. He stood about, restless uneasy, while, glancing door, every then, hoping would repent come find him. But not. Then began feel badly fear wrong. It hard struggle make new advances, now, nerved entered. She still standing back corner, sobbing, face wall. Tom’s heart smote him. He went stood moment, knowing exactly proceed. Then said hesitatingly: “Becky, I—I care anybody you.” No reply—but sobs. “Becky”—pleadingly. “Becky, say something?” More sobs. Tom got chiefest jewel, brass knob top andiron, passed around could see it, said: “Please, Becky, take it?” She struck floor. Then Tom marched house hills far away, return school day. Presently Becky began suspect. She ran door; sight; flew around play-yard; there. Then called: “Tom! Come back, Tom!” She listened intently, answer. She companions silence loneliness. So sat cry upbraid herself; time scholars began gather again, hide griefs still broken heart take cross long, dreary, aching afternoon, none among strangers exchange sorrows with. CHAPTER VIII TOM dodged hither thither lanes well track returning scholars, fell moody jog. He crossed small “branch” two three times, prevailing juvenile superstition cross water baffled pursuit. Half hour later disappearing behind Douglas mansion summit Cardiff Hill, school-house hardly distinguishable away valley behind him. He entered dense wood, picked pathless way centre it, sat mossy spot spreading oak. There even zephyr stirring; dead noonday heat even stilled songs birds; nature lay trance broken sound occasional far-off hammering wood-pecker, seemed render pervading silence sense loneliness profound. The boy’s soul steeped melancholy; feelings happy accord surroundings. He sat long elbows knees chin hands, meditating. It seemed life trouble, best, half envied Jimmy Hodges, lately released; must peaceful, thought, lie slumber dream forever ever, wind whispering trees caressing grass flowers grave, nothing bother grieve about, ever more. If clean Sunday-school record could willing go, done all. Now girl. What done? Nothing. He meant best world, treated like dog—like dog. She would sorry day—maybe late. Ah, could die _temporarily_! But elastic heart youth cannot compressed one constrained shape long time. Tom presently began drift insensibly back concerns life again. What turned back, now, disappeared mysteriously? What went away—ever far away, unknown countries beyond seas—and never came back more! How would feel then! The idea clown recurred now, fill disgust. For frivolity jokes spotted tights offense, intruded upon spirit exalted vague august realm romantic. No, would soldier, return long years, war-worn illustrious. No—better still, would join Indians, hunt buffaloes go warpath mountain ranges trackless great plains Far West, away future come back great chief, bristling feathers, hideous paint, prance Sunday-school, drowsy summer morning, blood-curdling war-whoop, sear eyeballs companions unappeasable envy. But no, something gaudier even this. He would pirate! That it! _now_ future lay plain him, glowing unimaginable splendor. How name would fill world, make people shudder! How gloriously would go plowing dancing seas, long, low, black-hulled racer, Spirit Storm, grisly flag flying fore! And zenith fame, would suddenly appear old village stalk church, brown weather-beaten, black velvet doublet trunks, great jack-boots, crimson sash, belt bristling horse-pistols, crime-rusted cutlass side, slouch hat waving plumes, black flag unfurled, skull crossbones it, hear swelling ecstasy whisperings, “It Tom Sawyer Pirate!—the Black Avenger Spanish Main!” Yes, settled; career determined. He would run away home enter upon it. He would start next morning. Therefore must begin get ready. He would collect resources together. He went rotten log near hand began dig one end Barlow knife. He soon struck wood sounded hollow. He put hand uttered incantation impressively: “What come here, come! What here, stay here!” Then scraped away dirt, exposed pine shingle. He took disclosed shapely little treasure-house whose bottom sides shingles. In lay marble. Tom’s astonishment bound-less! He scratched head perplexed air, said: “Well, beats anything!” Then tossed marble away pettishly, stood cogitating. The truth was, superstition failed, here, comrades always looked upon infallible. If buried marble certain necessary incantations, left alone fortnight, opened place incantation used, would find marbles ever lost gathered together there, meantime, matter widely separated. But now, thing actually unquestionably failed. Tom’s whole structure faith shaken foundations. He many time heard thing succeeding never failing before. It occur tried several times before, himself, could never find hiding-places afterward. He puzzled matter time, finally decided witch interfered broken charm. He thought would satisfy point; searched around till found small sandy spot little funnel-shaped depression it. He laid put mouth close depression called— “Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell I want know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell I want know!” The sand began work, presently small black bug appeared second darted fright. “He dare tell! So _was_ witch done it. I knowed it.” He well knew futility trying contend witches, gave discouraged. But occurred might well marble thrown away, therefore went made patient search it. But could find it. Now went back treasure-house carefully placed standing tossed marble away; took another marble pocket tossed way, saying: “Brother, go find brother!” He watched stopped, went looked. But must fallen short gone far; tried twice more. The last repetition successful. The two marbles lay within foot other. Just blast toy tin trumpet came faintly green aisles forest. Tom flung jacket trousers, turned suspender belt, raked away brush behind rotten log, disclosing rude bow arrow, lath sword tin trumpet, moment seized things bounded away, barelegged, fluttering shirt. He presently halted great elm, blew answering blast, began tiptoe look warily out, way that. He said cautiously—to imaginary company: “Hold, merry men! Keep hid till I blow.” Now appeared Joe Harper, airily clad elaborately armed Tom. Tom called: “Hold! Who comes Sherwood Forest without pass?” “Guy Guisborne wants man’s pass. Who art thou that—that—” “Dares hold language,” said Tom, prompting—for talked “by book,” memory. “Who art thou dares hold language?” “I, indeed! I Robin Hood, thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.” “Then art thou indeed famous outlaw? Right gladly I dispute thee passes merry wood. Have thee!” They took lath swords, dumped traps ground, struck fencing attitude, foot foot, began grave, careful combat, “two two down.” Presently Tom said: “Now, got hang, go lively!” So “went lively,” panting perspiring work. By Tom shouted: “Fall! fall! Why fall?” “I shall not! Why fall yourself? You getting worst it.” “Why, anything. I cannot fall; way book. The book says, ‘Then one back-handed stroke slew poor Guy Guisborne.’ You turn around let hit back.” There getting around authorities, Joe turned, received whack fell. “Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got let kill _you_. That fair.” “Why, I cannot that, book.” “Well, blamed mean—that all.” “Well, say, Joe, Friar Tuck Much miller’s son, lam quarter-staff; I Sheriff Nottingham Robin Hood little kill me.” This satisfactory, adventures carried out. Then Tom became Robin Hood again, allowed treacherous nun bleed strength away neglected wound. And last Joe, representing whole tribe weeping outlaws, dragged sadly forth, gave bow feeble hands, Tom said, “Where arrow falls, bury poor Robin Hood greenwood tree.” Then shot arrow fell back would died, lit nettle sprang gaily corpse. The boys dressed themselves, hid accoutrements, went grieving outlaws more, wondering modern civilization could claim done compensate loss. They said would rather outlaws year Sherwood Forest President United States forever. CHAPTER IX AT half-past nine, night, Tom Sid sent bed, usual. They said prayers, Sid soon asleep. Tom lay awake waited, restless impatience. When seemed must nearly daylight, heard clock strike ten! This despair. He would tossed fidgeted, nerves demanded, afraid might wake Sid. So lay still, stared dark. Everything dismally still. By by, stillness, little, scarcely perceptible noises began emphasize themselves. The ticking clock began bring notice. Old beams began crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued Aunt Polly’s chamber. And tiresome chirping cricket human ingenuity could locate, began. Next ghastly ticking death-watch wall bed’s head made Tom shudder—it meant somebody days numbered. Then howl far-off dog rose night air, answered fainter howl remoter distance. Tom agony. At last satisfied time ceased eternity begun; began doze, spite himself; clock chimed eleven, hear it. And came, mingling half-formed dreams, melancholy caterwauling. The raising neighboring window disturbed him. A cry “Scat! devil!” crash empty bottle back aunt’s woodshed brought wide awake, single minute later dressed window creeping along roof “ell” fours. He “meow’d” caution twice, went; jumped roof woodshed thence ground. Huckleberry Finn there, dead cat. The boys moved disappeared gloom. At end half hour wading tall grass graveyard. It graveyard old-fashioned Western kind. It hill, mile half village. It crazy board fence around it, leaned inward places, outward rest time, stood upright nowhere. Grass weeds grew rank whole cemetery. All old graves sunken in, tombstone place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered graves, leaning support finding none. “Sacred memory of” So-and-So painted once, could longer read, them, now, even light. A faint wind moaned trees, Tom feared might spirits dead, complaining disturbed. The boys talked little, breath, time place pervading solemnity silence oppressed spirits. They found sharp new heap seeking, ensconced within protection three great elms grew bunch within feet grave. Then waited silence seemed long time. The hooting distant owl sound troubled dead stillness. Tom’s reflections grew oppressive. He must force talk. So said whisper: “Hucky, believe dead people like us here?” Huckleberry whispered: “I wisht I knowed. It awful solemn like, _ain’t_ it?” “I bet is.” There considerable pause, boys canvassed matter inwardly. Then Tom whispered: “Say, Hucky—do reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?” “OF course does. Least sperrit does.” Tom, pause: “I wish I would said Mister Williams. But I never meant harm. Everybody calls Hoss.” “A body cannot partic’lar talk ’bout these-yer dead people, Tom.” This damper, conversation died again. Presently Tom seized comrade’s arm said: “Sh!” “What it, Tom?” And two clung together beating hearts. “Sh! There again! Did hear it?” “I—” “There! Now hear it.” “Lord, Tom, coming! They coming, sure. What do?” “I dono. Think see us?” “Oh, Tom, see dark, cats. I wisht I come.” “Oh, afeard. I believe bother us. We harm. If keep perfectly still, maybe notice us all.” “I try to, Tom, but, Lord, I shiver.” “Listen!” The boys bent heads together scarcely breathed. A muffled sound voices floated far end graveyard. “Look! See there!” whispered Tom. “What it?” “It devil-fire. Oh, Tom, awful.” Some vague figures approached gloom, swinging old-fashioned tin lantern freckled ground innumerable little spangles light. Presently Huckleberry whispered shudder: “It devils sure enough. Three them! Lordy, Tom, goners! Can pray?” “I try, afeard. They going hurt us. ‘Now I lay sleep, I—’” “Sh!” “What it, Huck?” “They _humans_! One is, anyway. One them’s old Muff Potter’s voice.” “No—’tain’t so, it?” “I bet I know it. Do stir budge. He sharp enough notice us. Drunk, usual, likely—blamed old rip!” “All right, I keep still. Now stuck. Cannot find it. Here come again. Now hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They p’inted right, time. Say, Huck, I know another voices; Injun Joe.” “That so—that murderin’ half-breed! I would druther devils dern sight. What kin to?” The whisper died wholly out, now, three men reached grave stood within feet boys’ hiding-place. “Here is,” said third voice; owner held lantern revealed face young Doctor Robinson. Potter Injun Joe carrying handbarrow rope couple shovels it. They cast load began open grave. The doctor put lantern head grave came sat back one elm trees. He close boys could touched him. “Hurry, men!” said, low voice; “the moon might come moment.” They growled response went digging. For time noise grating sound spades discharging freight mould gravel. It monotonous. Finally spade struck upon coffin dull woody accent, within another minute two men hoisted ground. They pried lid shovels, got body dumped rudely ground. The moon drifted behind clouds exposed pallid face. The barrow got ready corpse placed it, covered blanket, bound place rope. Potter took large spring-knife cut dangling end rope said: “Now cussed thing’s ready, Sawbones, another five, stays.” “That talk!” said Injun Joe. “Look here, mean?” said doctor. “You required pay advance, I paid you.” “Yes, done that,” said Injun Joe, approaching doctor, standing. “Five years ago drove away father’s kitchen one night, I come ask something eat, said I warn’t good; I swore I would get even took hundred years, father jailed vagrant. Did think I would forget? The Injun blood nothing. And I _got_ you, got _settle_, know!” He threatening doctor, fist face, time. The doctor struck suddenly stretched ruffian ground. Potter dropped knife, exclaimed: “Here, now, hit pard!” next moment grappled doctor two struggling might main, trampling grass tearing ground heels. Injun Joe sprang feet, eyes flaming passion, snatched Potter’s knife, went creeping, catlike stooping, round round combatants, seeking opportunity. All doctor flung free, seized heavy headboard Williams’ grave felled Potter earth it—and instant half-breed saw chance drove knife hilt young man’s breast. He reeled fell partly upon Potter, flooding blood, moment clouds blotted dreadful spectacle two frightened boys went speeding away dark. Presently, moon emerged again, Injun Joe standing two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave long gasp two still. The half-breed muttered: “_That_ score settled—damn you.” Then robbed body. After put fatal knife Potter’s open right hand, sat dismantled coffin. Three—four—five minutes passed, Potter began stir moan. His hand closed upon knife; raised it, glanced it, let fall, shudder. Then sat up, pushing body him, gazed it, around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe’s. “Lord, this, Joe?” said. “It dirty business,” said Joe, without moving. “What for?” “I! I never done it!” “Look here! That kind talk wash.” Potter trembled grew white. “I thought I would got sober. I would business drink to-night. But head yet—worse’n started here. I muddle; cannot recollect anything it, hardly. Tell me, Joe—_honest_, now, old feller—did I it? Joe, I never meant to—’pon soul honor, I never meant to, Joe. Tell was, Joe. Oh, awful—and young promising.” “Why, two scuffling, fetched one headboard fell flat; come, reeling staggering like, snatched knife jammed him, fetched another awful clip—and laid, dead wedge til now.” “Oh, I know I a-doing. I wish I may die minute I did. It account whiskey excitement, I reckon. I never used weepon life before, Joe. I fought, never weepons. They say that. Joe, tell! Say tell, Joe—that good feller. I always liked you, Joe, stood you, too. Do remember? You _won’t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?” And poor creature dropped knees stolid murderer, clasped appealing hands. “No, always fair square me, Muff Potter, I go back you. There, now, fair man say.” “Oh, Joe, angel. I bless longest day I live.” And Potter began cry. “Come, now, enough that. This time blubbering. You yonder way I go this. Move, now, leave tracks behind you.” Potter started trot quickly increased run. The half-breed stood looking him. He muttered: “If much stunned lick fuddled rum look being, think knife till gone far afraid come back place himself—chicken-heart!” Two three minutes later murdered man, blanketed corpse, lidless coffin, open grave inspection moon’s. The stillness complete again, too. CHAPTER X THE two boys flew on, toward village, speechless horror. They glanced backward shoulders time time, apprehensively, feared might followed. Every stump started path seemed man enemy, made catch breath; sped outlying cottages lay near village, barking aroused watch-dogs seemed give wings feet. “If get old tannery break down!” whispered Tom, short catches breaths. “I cannot stand much longer.” Huckleberry’s hard pantings reply, boys fixed eyes goal hopes bent work win it. They gained steadily it, last, breast breast, burst open door fell grateful exhausted sheltering shadows beyond. By pulses slowed down, Tom whispered: “Huckleberry, reckon’ll come this?” “If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging’ll come it.” “Do though?” “Why, I _know_ it, Tom.” Tom thought while, said: “Who tell? We?” “What talking about? S’pose something happened Injun Joe _didn’t_ hang? Why, would kill us time other, dead sure laying here.” “That I thinking myself, Huck.” “If anybody tells, let Muff Potter it, fool enough. He generally drunk enough.” Tom said nothing—went thinking. Presently whispered: “Huck, Muff Potter know it. How tell?” “What reason know it?” “Because would got whack Injun Joe done it. D’you reckon could see anything? D’you reckon knowed anything?” “By hokey, so, Tom!” “And besides, look-a-here—maybe whack done _him_!” “No, ’taint likely, Tom. He liquor him; I could see that; besides, always has. Well, pap’s full, might take belt head church could phase him. He says so, self. So Muff Potter, course. But man dead sober, I reckon maybe whack might fetch him; I dono.” After another reflective silence, Tom said: “Hucky, sure keep mum?” “Tom, _got_ keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil would make drownding us couple cats, squeak ’bout hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take swear one another—that got do—swear keep mum.” “I agreed. It best thing. Would hold hands swear we—” “Oh no, would this. That good enough little rubbishy common things—specially gals, cuz _they_ go back anyway, blab get huff—but orter writing ’bout big thing like this. And blood.” Tom’s whole applauded idea. It deep, dark, awful; hour, circumstances, surroundings, keeping it. He picked clean pine shingle lay moon-light, took little fragment “red keel” pocket, got moon work, painfully scrawled lines, emphasizing slow down-stroke clamping tongue teeth, letting pressure up-strokes. [See next page.] “Huck Finn Tom Sawyer swears keep mum This They wish They may Drop dead Their Tracks They ever Tell Rot.” Huckleberry filled admiration Tom’s facility writing, sublimity language. He took pin lapel going prick flesh, Tom said: “Hold on! Do that. A pin’s brass. It might verdigrease it.” “What verdigrease?” “It p’ison. That is. You swaller once—you see.” So Tom unwound thread one needles, boy pricked ball thumb squeezed drop blood. In time, many squeezes, Tom managed sign initials, using ball little finger pen. Then showed Huckleberry make H F, oath complete. They buried shingle close wall, dismal ceremonies incantations, fetters bound tongues considered locked key thrown away. A figure crept stealthily break end ruined building, now, notice it. “Tom,” whispered Huckleberry, “does keep us _ever_ telling—_always_?” “Of course does. It make difference _what_ happens, got keep mum. We would drop dead—do _you_ know that?” “Yes, I reckon so.” They continued whisper little time. Presently dog set long, lugubrious howl outside—within ten feet them. The boys clasped suddenly, agony fright. “Which us mean?” gasped Huckleberry. “I dono—peep crack. Quick!” “No, _you_, Tom!” “I cannot—I cannot _do_ it, Huck!” “Please, Tom. There again!” “Oh, lordy, I thankful!” whispered Tom. “I know voice. It Bull Harbison.” * [* If Mr. Harbison owned slave named Bull, Tom would spoken “Harbison’s Bull,” son dog name “Bull Harbison.”] “Oh, good—I tell you, Tom, I scared death; I would bet anything _stray_ dog.” The dog howled again. The boys’ hearts sank more. “Oh, my! Bull Harbison!” whispered Huckleberry. “_Do_, Tom!” Tom, quaking fear, yielded, put eye crack. His whisper hardly audible said: “Oh, Huck, _its stray dog_!” “Quick, Tom, quick! Who mean?” “Huck, must mean us both—we right together.” “Oh, Tom, I reckon goners. I reckon mistake ’bout _I’ll_ go to. I wicked.” “Dad fetch it! This comes playing hookey everything feller’s told _not_ do. I might good, like Sid, I would tried—but no, I would not, course. But ever I get time, I lay I _waller_ Sunday-schools!” And Tom began snuffle little. “_You_ bad!” Huckleberry began snuffle too. “Consound it, Tom Sawyer, old pie, ’long-side I am. Oh, _lordy_, lordy, lordy, I wisht I half chance.” Tom choked whispered: “Look, Hucky, look! He got _back_ us!” Hucky looked, joy heart. “Well, has, jingoes! Did before?” “Yes, did. But I, like fool, never thought. Oh, bully, know. _Now_ mean?” The howling stopped. Tom pricked ears. “Sh! What that?” whispered. “Sounds like—like hogs grunting. No—it somebody snoring, Tom.” “That _is_ it! Where ’bouts it, Huck?” “I bleeve ’tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used sleep there, sometimes, ’long hogs, laws bless you, lifts things _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon ever coming back town more.” The spirit adventure rose boys’ souls more. “Hucky, das’t go I lead?” “I like to, much. Tom, s’pose Injun Joe!” Tom quailed. But presently temptation rose strong boys agreed try, understanding would take heels snoring stopped. So went tiptoeing stealthily down, one behind other. When got within five steps snorer, Tom stepped stick, broke sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed little, face came moonlight. It Muff Potter. The boys’ hearts stood still, hopes too, man moved, fears passed away now. They tip-toed out, broken weather-boarding, stopped little distance exchange parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose night air again! They turned saw strange dog standing within feet Potter lying, _facing_ Potter, nose pointing heavenward. “Oh, geeminy, _him_!” exclaimed boys, breath. “Say, Tom—they say stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller’s house, ’bout midnight, much two weeks ago; whippoorwill come lit banisters sung, evening; anybody dead yet.” “Well, I know that. And suppose not. Did Gracie Miller fall kitchen fire burn terrible next Saturday?” “Yes, _dead_. And more, getting better, too.” “All right, wait see. She goner, dead sure Muff Potter’s goner. That niggers say, know kind things, Huck.” Then separated, cogitating. When Tom crept bedroom window night almost spent. He undressed excessive caution, fell asleep congratulating nobody knew escapade. He aware gently-snoring Sid awake, hour. When Tom awoke, Sid dressed gone. There late look light, late sense atmosphere. He startled. Why called—persecuted till up, usual? The thought filled bodings. Within five minutes dressed down-stairs, feeling sore drowsy. The family still table, finished breakfast. There voice rebuke; averted eyes; silence air solemnity struck chill culprit’s heart. He sat tried seem gay, up-hill work; roused smile, response, lapsed silence let heart sink depths. After breakfast aunt took aside, Tom almost brightened hope going flogged; so. His aunt wept asked could go break old heart so; finally told go on, ruin bring gray hairs sorrow grave, use try more. This worse thousand whippings, Tom’s heart sorer body. He cried, pleaded forgiveness, promised reform again, received dismissal, feeling imperfect forgiveness established feeble confidence. He left presence miserable even feel revengeful toward Sid; latter’s prompt retreat back gate unnecessary. He moped school gloomy sad, took flogging, along Joe Harper, playing hookey day before, air one whose heart busy heavier woes wholly dead trifles. Then betook seat, rested elbows desk jaws hands, stared wall stony stare suffering reached limit go. His elbow pressing hard substance. After long time slowly sadly changed position, took object sigh. It paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal sigh followed, heart broke. It brass andiron knob! This final feather broke camel’s back. CHAPTER XI CLOSE upon hour noon whole village suddenly electrified ghastly news. No need yet un-dreamed-of telegraph; tale flew man man, group group, house house, little less telegraphic speed. Of course schoolmaster gave holi-day afternoon; town would thought strangely not. A gory knife found close murdered man, recognized somebody belonging Muff Potter—so story ran. And said belated citizen come upon Potter washing “branch” one two clock morning, Potter sneaked off—suspicious circumstances, especially washing habit Potter. It also said town ransacked “murderer” (the public slow matter sifting evidence arriving verdict), could found. Horsemen departed roads every direction, Sheriff “was confident” would captured night. All town drifting toward graveyard. Tom’s heartbreak vanished joined procession, would thousand times rather go anywhere else, awful, unaccountable fascination drew on. Arrived dreadful place, wormed small body crowd saw dismal spectacle. It seemed age since before. Somebody pinched arm. He turned, eyes met Huckleberry’s. Then looked elsewhere once, wondered anybody noticed anything mutual glance. But everybody talking, intent upon grisly spectacle them. “Poor fellow!” “Poor young fellow!” “This ought lesson grave robbers!” “Muff Potter’ll hang catch him!” This drift remark; minister said, “It judgment; His hand here.” Now Tom shivered head heel; eye fell upon stolid face Injun Joe. At moment crowd began sway struggle, voices shouted, “It him! him! coming himself!” “Who? Who?” twenty voices. “Muff Potter!” “Hallo, stopped!—Look out, turning! Do let get away!” People branches trees Tom’s head said trying get away—he looked doubtful perplexed. “Infernal impudence!” said bystander; “wanted come take quiet look work, I reckon—did expect company.” The crowd fell apart, now, Sheriff came through, ostentatiously leading Potter arm. The poor fellow’s face haggard, eyes showed fear upon him. When stood murdered man, shook palsy, put face hands burst tears. “I it, friends,” sobbed; “’pon word honor I never done it.” “Who accused you?” shouted voice. This shot seemed carry home. Potter lifted face looked around pathetic hopelessness eyes. He saw Injun Joe, exclaimed: “Oh, Injun Joe, promised would never—” “Is knife?” thrust Sheriff. Potter would fallen caught eased ground. Then said: “Something told ’t I come back get—” He shuddered; waved nerveless hand vanquished gesture said, “Tell them, Joe, tell them—it use more.” Then Huckleberry Tom stood dumb staring, heard stony-hearted liar reel serene statement, expecting every moment clear sky would deliver God’s lightnings upon head, wondering see long stroke delayed. And finished still stood alive whole, wavering impulse break oath save poor betrayed prisoner’s life faded vanished away, plainly miscreant sold Satan would fatal meddle property power that. “Why leave? What want come for?” somebody said. “I could help it—I could help it,” Potter moaned. “I wanted run away, I could seem come anywhere here.” And fell sobbing again. Injun Joe repeated statement, calmly, minutes afterward inquest, oath; boys, seeing lightnings still withheld, confirmed belief Joe sold devil. He become, them, balefully interesting object ever looked upon, could take fascinated eyes face. They inwardly resolved watch nights, opportunity offer, hope getting glimpse dread master. Injun Joe helped raise body murdered man put wagon removal; whispered shuddering crowd wound bled little! The boys thought happy circumstance would turn suspicion right direction; disappointed, one villager remarked: “It within three feet Muff Potter done it.” Tom’s fearful secret gnawing conscience disturbed sleep much week this; breakfast one morning Sid said: “Tom, pitch around talk sleep much keep awake half time.” Tom blanched dropped eyes. “It bad sign,” said Aunt Polly, gravely. “What got mind, Tom?” “Nothing. Nothing ’t I know of.” But boy’s hand shook spilled coffee. “And talk stuff,” Sid said. “Last night said, ‘It blood, blood, is!’ You said over. And said, ‘Do torment so—I tell!’ Tell _what_? What tell?” Everything swimming Tom. There telling might happened, now, luckily concern passed Aunt Polly’s face came Tom’s relief without knowing it. She said: “Sho! It dreadful murder. I dream every night myself. Sometimes I dream done it.” Mary said affected much way. Sid seemed satisfied. Tom got presence quick plausibly could, complained toothache week, tied jaws every night. He never knew Sid lay nightly watching, frequently slipped bandage free leaned elbow listening good time, afterward slipped bandage back place again. Tom’s distress mind wore gradually toothache grew irksome discarded. If Sid really managed make anything Tom’s disjointed mutterings, kept himself. It seemed Tom schoolmates never would get done holding inquests dead cats, thus keeping trouble present mind. Sid noticed Tom never coroner one inquiries, though habit take lead new enterprises; noticed, too, Tom never acted witness—and strange; Sid overlook fact Tom even showed marked aversion inquests, always avoided could. Sid marvelled, said nothing. However, even inquests went vogue last, ceased torture Tom’s conscience. Every day two, time sorrow, Tom watched opportunity went little grated jail-window smuggled small comforts “murderer” could get hold of. The jail trifling little brick den stood marsh edge village, guards afforded it; indeed, seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped ease Tom’s conscience. The villagers strong desire tar-and-feather Injun Joe ride rail, body-snatching, formidable character nobody could found willing take lead matter, dropped. He careful begin inquest-statements fight, without confessing grave-robbery preceded it; therefore deemed wisest try case courts present. CHAPTER XII ONE reasons Tom’s mind drifted away secret troubles was, found new weighty matter interest about. Becky Thatcher stopped coming school. Tom struggled pride days, tried “whistle wind,” failed. He began find hanging around father’s house, nights, feeling miserable. She ill. What die! There distraction thought. He longer took interest war, even piracy. The charm life gone; nothing dreariness left. He put hoop away, bat; joy more. His aunt concerned. She began try manner remedies him. She one people infatuated patent medicines new-fangled methods producing health mending it. She inveterate experimenter things. When something fresh line came fever, right away, try it; herself, never ailing, anybody else came handy. She subscriber “Health” periodicals phrenological frauds; solemn ignorance inflated breath nostrils. All “rot” contained ventilation, go bed, get up, eat, drink, much exercise take, frame mind keep one’s self in, sort clothing wear, gospel her, never observed health-journals current month customarily upset everything recommended month before. She simple-hearted honest day long, easy victim. She gathered together quack periodicals quack medicines, thus armed death, went pale horse, metaphorically speaking, “hell following after.” But never suspected angel healing balm Gilead disguise, suffering neighbors. The water treatment new, now, Tom’s low condition windfall her. She daylight every morning, stood wood-she would drowned deluge cold water; scrubbed towel like file, brought to; rolled wet sheet put away blankets till sweated soul clean “the yellow stains came pores”—as Tom said. Yet notwithstanding this, boy grew melancholy pale dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, plunges. The boy remained dismal hearse. She began assist water slim oatmeal diet blister-plasters. She calculated capacity would jug’s, filled every day quack cure-alls. Tom become indifferent persecution time. This phase filled old lady’s heart consternation. This indifference must broken cost. Now heard Pain-killer first time. She ordered lot once. She tasted filled gratitude. It simply fire liquid form. She dropped water treatment everything else, pinned faith Pain-killer. She gave Tom teaspoonful watched deepest anxiety result. Her troubles instantly rest, soul peace again; “indifference” broken up. The boy could shown wilder, heartier interest, built fire him. Tom felt time wake up; sort life might romantic enough, blighted condition, getting little sentiment much distracting variety it. So thought various plans relief, finally hit upon professing fond Pain-killer. He asked often became nuisance, aunt ended telling help quit bothering her. If Sid, would misgivings alloy delight; since Tom, watched bottle clandestinely. She found medicine really diminish, occur boy mending health crack sitting-room floor it. One day Tom act dosing crack aunt’s yellow cat came along, purring, eyeing teaspoon avariciously, begging taste. Tom said: “Do ask unless want it, Peter.” But Peter signified want it. “You better make sure.” Peter sure. “Now asked it, I give you, anything mean me; find like it, must blame anybody self.” Peter agreeable. So Tom pried mouth open poured Pain-killer. Peter sprang couple yards air, delivered war-whoop set round round room, banging furniture, upsetting flower-pots, making general havoc. Next rose hind feet pranced around, frenzy enjoyment, head shoulder voice proclaiming unappeasable happiness. Then went tearing around house spreading chaos destruction path. Aunt Polly entered time see throw double summersets, deliver final mighty hurrah, sail open window, carrying rest flower-pots him. The old lady stood petrified astonishment, peering glasses; Tom lay floor expiring laughter. “Tom, earth ails cat?” “I know, aunt,” gasped boy. “Why, I never see anything like it. What make act so?” “Deed I know, Aunt Polly; cats always act good time.” “They do, they?” There something tone made Tom apprehensive. “Yes’m. That is, I believe do.” “You _do_?” “Yes’m.” The old lady bending down, Tom watching, interest emphasized anxiety. Too late divined “drift.” The handle telltale tea-spoon visible bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held up. Tom winced, dropped eyes. Aunt Polly raised usual handle—his ear—and cracked head soundly thimble. “Now, sir, want treat poor dumb beast so, for?” “I done pity him—because aunt.” “Had aunt!—you numskull. What got it?” “Heaps. Because would one would burnt herself! She would roasted bowels ’thout feeling human!” Aunt Polly felt sudden pang remorse. This putting thing new light; cruelty cat _might_ cruelty boy, too. She began soften; felt sorry. Her eyes watered little, put hand Tom’s head said gently: “I meaning best, Tom. And, Tom, _did_ good.” Tom looked face perceptible twinkle peeping gravity. “I know meaning best, aunty, I Peter. It done _him_ good, too. I never see get around since—” “Oh, go ’long you, Tom, aggravate again. And try see cannot good boy, once, need take medicine.” Tom reached school ahead time. It noticed strange thing occurring every day latterly. And now, usual late, hung gate schoolyard instead playing comrades. He sick, said, looked it. He tried seem looking everywhere whither really looking—down road. Presently Jeff Thatcher hove sight, Tom’s face lighted; gazed moment, turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; “led up” warily opportunities remark Becky, giddy lad never could see bait. Tom watched watched, hoping whenever frisking frock came sight, hating owner soon saw right one. At last frocks ceased appear, dropped hopelessly dumps; entered empty schoolhouse sat suffer. Then one frock passed gate, Tom’s heart gave great bound. The next instant out, “going on” like Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping fence risk life limb, throwing handsprings, standing head—doing heroic things could conceive of, keeping furtive eye out, while, see Becky Thatcher noticing. But seemed unconscious all; never looked. Could possible aware there? He carried exploits immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched boy’s cap, hurled roof schoolhouse, broke group boys, tumbling every direction, fell sprawling, himself, Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her—and turned, nose air, heard say: “Mf! people think mighty smart—always showing off!” Tom’s cheeks burned. He gathered sneaked off, crushed crestfallen. CHAPTER XIII TOM’S mind made now. He gloomy desperate. He forsaken, friendless boy, said; nobody loved him; found driven to, perhaps would sorry; tried right get along, would let him; since nothing would rid him, let so; let blame _him_ consequences—why they? What right friendless complain? Yes, forced last: would lead life crime. There choice. By time far Meadow Lane, bell school “take up” tinkled faintly upon ear. He sobbed, now, think never, never hear old familiar sound more—it hard, forced him; since driven cold world, must submit—but forgave them. Then sobs came thick fast. Just point met soul’s sworn comrade, Joe Harper—hard-eyed, evidently great dismal purpose heart. Plainly “two souls single thought.” Tom, wiping eyes sleeve, began blubber something resolution escape hard usage lack sympathy home roaming abroad great world never return; ended hoping Joe would forget him. But transpired request Joe going make Tom, come hunt purpose. His mother whipped drinking cream never tasted knew nothing about; plain tired wished go; felt way, nothing succumb; hoped would happy, never regret driven poor boy unfeeling world suffer die. As two boys walked sorrowing along, made new compact stand brothers never separate till death relieved troubles. Then began lay plans. Joe hermit, living crusts remote cave, dying, time, cold want grief; listening Tom, conceded conspicuous advantages life crime, consented pirate. Three miles St. Petersburg, point Mississippi River trifle mile wide, long, narrow, wooded island, shallow bar head it, offered well rendezvous. It inhabited; lay far toward shore, abreast dense almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson’s Island chosen. Who subjects piracies matter occur them. Then hunted Huckleberry Finn, joined promptly, careers one him; indifferent. They presently separated meet lonely spot river-bank two miles village favorite hour—which midnight. There small log raft meant capture. Each would bring hooks lines, provision could steal dark mysterious way—as became outlaws. And afternoon done, managed enjoy sweet glory spreading fact pretty soon town would “hear something.” All got vague hint cautioned “be mum wait.” About midnight Tom arrived boiled ham trifles, stopped dense undergrowth small bluff overlooking meeting-place. It starlight, still. The mighty river lay like ocean rest. Tom listened moment, sound disturbed quiet. Then gave low, distinct whistle. It answered bluff. Tom whistled twice more; signals answered way. Then guarded voice said: “Who goes there?” “Tom Sawyer, Black Avenger Spanish Main. Name names.” “Huck Finn Red-Handed, Joe Harper Terror Seas.” Tom furnished titles, favorite literature. “It Is well. Give countersign.” Two hoarse whispers delivered awful word simultaneously brooding night: “_Blood_!” Then Tom tumbled ham bluff let it, tearing skin clothes extent effort. There easy, comfortable path along shore bluff, lacked advantages difficulty danger valued pirate. The Terror Seas brought side bacon, worn getting there. Finn Red-Handed stolen skillet quantity half-cured leaf tobacco, also brought corn-cobs make pipes with. But none pirates smoked “chewed” himself. The Black Avenger Spanish Main said would never start without fire. That wise thought; matches hardly known day. They saw fire smouldering upon great raft hundred yards above, went stealthily thither helped chunk. They made imposing adventure it, saying, “Hist!” every then, suddenly halting finger lip; moving hands imaginary dagger-hilts; giving orders dismal whispers “the foe” stirred, “let hilt,” “dead men tell tales.” They knew well enough raftsmen village laying stores spree, still excuse conducting thing unpiratical way. They shoved off, presently, Tom command, Huck oar Joe forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, folded arms, gave orders low, stern whisper: “Luff, bring wind!” “Aye-aye, sir!” “Steady, steady-y-y-y!” “Steady is, sir!” “Let go point!” “Point is, sir!” As boys steadily monotonously drove raft toward mid-stream doubt understood orders given “style,” intended mean anything particular. “What sail’s carrying?” “Courses, tops’ls, flying-jib, sir.” “Send r’yals up! Lay aloft, there, half dozen ye—foretopmaststuns’l! Lively, now!” “Aye-aye, sir!” “Shake maintogalans’l! Sheets braces! _now_ hearties!” “Aye-aye, sir!” “Hellum-a-lee—hard port! Stand meet comes! Port, port! _Now_, men! With will! Stead-y-y-y!” “Steady is, sir!” The raft drew beyond middle river; boys pointed head right, lay oars. The river high, two three mile current. Hardly word said next three-quarters hour. Now raft passing distant town. Two three glimmering lights showed lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond vague vast sweep star-gemmed water, unconscious tremendous event happening. The Black Avenger stood still folded arms, “looking last” upon scene former joys later sufferings, wishing “she” could see now, abroad wild sea, facing peril death dauntless heart, going doom grim smile lips. It small strain imagination remove Jackson’s Island beyond eye-shot village, “looked last” broken satisfied heart. The pirates looking last, too; looked long came near letting current drift range island. But discovered danger time, made shift avert it. About two clock morning raft grounded bar two hundred yards head island, waded back forth landed freight. Part little raft’s belongings consisted old sail, spread nook bushes tent shelter provisions; would sleep open air good weather, became outlaws. They built fire side great log twenty thirty steps within sombre depths forest, cooked bacon frying-pan supper, used half corn “pone” stock brought. It seemed glorious sport feasting wild, free way virgin forest unexplored uninhabited island, far haunts men, said never would return civilization. The climbing fire lit faces threw ruddy glare upon pillared tree-trunks forest temple, upon varnished foliage festooning vines. When last crisp slice bacon gone, last allowance corn pone devoured, boys stretched grass, filled contentment. They could found cooler place, would deny romantic feature roasting campfire. “_Ain’t_ gay?” said Joe. “It _nuts_!” said Tom. “What would boys say could see us?” “Say? Well, would die here—hey, Hucky!” “I reckon so,” said Huckleberry; “anyways, I suited. I want nothing better’n this. I ever get enough eat, gen’ally—and cannot come pick feller bullyrag so.” “It life me,” said Tom. “You get up, mornings, go school, wash, blame foolishness. You see pirate _anything_, Joe, ashore, hermit _he_ praying considerable, fun, anyway, way.” “Oh yes, so,” said Joe, “but I thought much it, know. I would good deal rather pirate, I tried it.” “You see,” said Tom, “people go much hermits, nowadays, like used old times, pirate’s always respected. And hermit’s got sleep hardest place find, put sackcloth ashes head, stand rain, and—” “What put sackcloth ashes head for?” inquired Huck. “I dono. But _got_ it. Hermits always do. You would hermit.” “Dern’d I would,” said Huck. “Well, would do?” “I dono. But I would that.” “Why, Huck, would _have_ to. How get around it?” “Why, I would stand it. I would run away.” “Run away! Well, _would_ nice old slouch hermit. You would disgrace.” The Red-Handed made response, better employed. He finished gouging cob, fitted weed stem it, loaded tobacco, pressing coal charge blowing cloud fragrant smoke—he full bloom luxurious contentment. The pirates envied majestic vice, secretly resolved acquire shortly. Presently Huck said: “What pirates do?” Tom said: “Oh, bully time—take ships burn them, get money bury awful places island ghosts things watch it, kill everybody ships—make walk plank.” “And carry women island,” said Joe; “they kill women.” “No,” assented Tom, “they kill women—they noble. And women’s always beautiful, too. “And wear bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold silver di’monds,” said Joe, enthusiasm. “Who?” said Huck. “Why, pirates.” Huck scanned clothing forlornly. “I reckon I dressed fitten pirate,” said he, regretful pathos voice; “but I got none these.” But boys told fine clothes would come fast enough, begun adventures. They made understand poor rags would begin with, though customary wealthy pirates start proper wardrobe. Gradually talk died drowsiness began steal upon eyelids little waifs. The pipe dropped fingers Red-Handed, slept sleep conscience-free weary. The Terror Seas Black Avenger Spanish Main difficulty getting sleep. They said prayers inwardly, lying down, since nobody authority make kneel recite aloud; truth, mind say all, afraid proceed lengths that, lest might call sudden special thunderbolt heaven. Then reached hovered upon imminent verge sleep—but intruder came, now, would “down.” It conscience. They began feel vague fear wrong run away; next thought stolen meat, real torture came. They tried argue away reminding conscience purloined sweetmeats apples scores times; conscience appeased thin plausibilities; seemed them, end, getting around stubborn fact taking sweetmeats “hooking,” taking bacon hams valuables plain simple stealing—and command Bible. So inwardly resolved long remained business, piracies sullied crime stealing. Then conscience granted truce, curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully sleep. CHAPTER XIV WHEN Tom awoke morning, wondered was. He sat rubbed eyes looked around. Then comprehended. It cool gray dawn, delicious sense repose peace deep pervading calm silence woods. Not leaf stirred; sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood upon leaves grasses. A white layer ashes covered fire, thin blue breath smoke rose straight air. Joe Huck still slept. Now, far away woods bird called; another answered; presently hammering woodpecker heard. Gradually cool dim gray morning whitened, gradually sounds multiplied life manifested itself. The marvel Nature shaking sleep going work unfolded musing boy. A little green worm came crawling dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds body air time time “sniffing around,” proceeding again—for measuring, Tom said; worm approached him, accord, sat still stone, hopes rising falling, turns, creature still came toward seemed inclined go elsewhere; last considered painful moment curved body air came decisively upon Tom’s leg began journey him, whole heart glad—for meant going new suit clothes—without shadow doubt gaudy piratical uniform. Now procession ants appeared, nowhere particular, went labors; one struggled manfully dead spider five times big arms, lugged straight tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed dizzy height grass blade, Tom bent close said, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, house fire, children’s alone,” took wing went see it—which surprise boy, knew old insect credulous conflagrations, practised upon simplicity once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily ball, Tom touched creature, see shut legs body pretend dead. The birds fairly rioting time. A catbird, Northern mocker, lit tree Tom’s head, trilled imitations neighbors rapture enjoyment; shrill jay swept down, flash blue flame, stopped twig almost within boy’s reach, cocked head one side eyed strangers consuming curiosity; gray squirrel big fellow “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting intervals inspect chatter boys, wild things probably never seen human scarcely knew whether afraid not. All Nature wide awake stirring, now; long lances sunlight pierced dense foliage far near, butterflies came fluttering upon scene. Tom stirred pirates clattered away shout, minute two stripped chasing tumbling shallow limpid water white sandbar. They felt longing little village sleeping distance beyond majestic waste water. A vagrant current slight rise river carried raft, gratified them, since going something like burning bridge civilization. They came back camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, ravenous; soon camp-fire blazing again. Huck found spring clear cold water close by, boys made cups broad oak hickory leaves, felt water, sweetened wildwood charm that, would good enough substitute coffee. While Joe slicing bacon breakfast, Tom Huck asked hold minute; stepped promising nook river-bank threw lines; almost immediately reward. Joe time get impatient back handsome bass, couple sun-perch small catfish—provisions enough quite family. They fried fish bacon, astonished; fish ever seemed delicious before. They know quicker fresh-water fish fire caught better is; reflected little upon sauce open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, large ingredient hunger make, too. They lay around shade, breakfast, Huck smoke, went woods exploring expedition. They tramped gayly along, decaying logs, tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs forest, hung crowns ground drooping regalia grape-vines. Now came upon snug nooks carpeted grass jeweled flowers. They found plenty things delighted with, nothing astonished at. They discovered island three miles long quarter mile wide, shore lay closest separated narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide. They took swim every hour, close upon middle afternoon got back camp. They hungry stop fish, fared sumptuously upon cold ham, threw shade talk. But talk soon began drag, died. The stillness, solemnity brooded woods, sense loneliness, began tell upon spirits boys. They fell thinking. A sort undefined longing crept upon them. This took dim shape, presently—it budding homesickness. Even Finn Red-Handed dreaming doorsteps empty hogsheads. But ashamed weakness, none brave enough speak thought. For time, now, boys dully conscious peculiar sound distance, one sometimes ticking clock takes distinct note of. But mysterious sound became pronounced, forced recognition. The boys started, glanced other, assumed listening attitude. There long silence, profound unbroken; deep, sullen boom came floating distance. “What it!” exclaimed Joe, breath. “I wonder,” said Tom whisper. “’Tain’t thunder,” said Huckleberry, awed tone, “becuz thunder—” “Hark!” said Tom. “Listen—do talk.” They waited time seemed age, muffled boom troubled solemn hush. “Let us go see.” They sprang feet hurried shore toward town. They parted bushes bank peered water. The little steam ferry-boat mile village, drifting current. Her broad deck seemed crowded people. There great many skiffs rowing floating stream neighborhood ferryboat, boys could determine men doing. Presently great jet white smoke burst ferryboat’s side, expanded rose lazy cloud, dull throb sound borne listeners again. “I know now!” exclaimed Tom; “somebody drownded!” “That it!” said Huck; “they done last summer, Bill Turner got drownded; shoot cannon water, makes come top. Yes, take loaves bread put quicksilver set afloat, wherever anybody drownded, float right stop.” “Yes, I heard that,” said Joe. “I wonder makes bread that.” “Oh, bread, much,” said Tom; “I reckon mostly _say_ start out.” “But say anything it,” said Huck. “I seen not.” “Well, funny,” said Tom. “But maybe say themselves. Of _course_ do. Anybody might know that.” The boys agreed reason Tom said, ignorant lump bread, uninstructed incantation, could expected act intelligently set upon errand gravity. “By jings, I wish I there, now,” said Joe. “I too” said Huck “I would give heaps know is.” The boys still listened watched. Presently revealing thought flashed Tom’s mind, exclaimed: “Boys, I know drownded—it us!” They felt like heroes instant. Here gorgeous triumph; missed; mourned; hearts breaking account; tears would; accusing memories unkindness poor lost lads rising up, unavailing regrets remorse indulged; best all, departed talk whole town, envy boys, far dazzling notoriety concerned. This fine. It worth pirate, all. As twilight drew on, ferryboat went back accustomed business skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned camp. They jubilant vanity new grandeur illustrious trouble making. They caught fish, cooked supper ate it, fell guessing village thinking saying them; pictures drew public distress account gratifying look upon—from point view. But shadows night closed in, gradually ceased talk, sat gazing fire, minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The excitement gone, now, Tom Joe could keep back thoughts certain persons home enjoying fine frolic much were. Misgivings came; grew troubled unhappy; sigh two escaped, unawares. By Joe timidly ventured upon roundabout “feeler” others might look upon return civilization—not right now, but— Tom withered derision! Huck, uncommitted yet, joined Tom, waverer quickly “explained,” glad get scrape little taint chicken-hearted home-sickness clinging garments could. Mutiny effectually laid rest moment. As night deepened, Huck began nod, presently snore. Joe followed next. Tom lay upon elbow motionless, time, watching two intently. At last got cautiously, knees, went searching among grass flickering reflections flung campfire. He picked inspected several large semi-cylinders thin white bark sycamore, finally chose two seemed suit him. Then knelt fire painfully wrote something upon “red keel”; one rolled put jacket pocket, put Joe’s hat removed little distance owner. And also put hat certain schoolboy treasures almost inestimable value—among lump chalk, India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, one kind marbles known “sure ’nough crystal.” Then tiptoed way cautiously among trees till felt hearing, straightway broke keen run direction sandbar. CHAPTER XV A minutes later Tom shoal water bar, wading toward Illinois shore. Before depth reached middle halfway over; current would permit wading, now, struck confidently swim remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering upstream, still swept downward rather faster expected. However, reached shore finally, drifted along till found low place drew out. He put hand jacket pocket, found piece bark safe, struck woods, following shore, streaming garments. Shortly ten clock came open place opposite village, saw ferryboat lying shadow trees high bank. Everything quiet blinking stars. He crept bank, watching eyes, slipped water, swam three four strokes climbed skiff “yawl” duty boat’s stern. He laid thwarts waited, panting. Presently cracked bell tapped voice gave order “cast off.” A minute two later skiff’s head standing high up, boat’s swell, voyage begun. Tom felt happy success, knew boat’s last trip night. At end long twelve fifteen minutes wheels stopped, Tom slipped overboard swam ashore dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, danger possible stragglers. He flew along unfrequented alleys, shortly found aunt’s back fence. He climbed over, approached “ell,” looked sitting-room window, light burning there. There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, Joe Harper’s mother, grouped together, talking. They bed, bed door. Tom went door began softly lift latch; pressed gently door yielded crack; continued pushing cautiously, quaking every time creaked, till judged might squeeze knees; put head began, warily. “What makes candle blow so?” said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. “Why, door’s open, I believe. Why, course is. No end strange things now. Go ’long shut it, Sid.” Tom disappeared bed time. He lay “breathed” time, crept could almost touch aunt’s foot. “But I saying,” said Aunt Polly, “he warn’t _bad_, say—only misch_ee_vous. Only giddy, harum-scarum, know. He warn’t responsible colt. _He_ never meant harm, best-hearted boy ever was”—and began cry. “It Joe—always full devilment, every kind mischief, unselfish kind could be—and laws bless me, think I went whipped taking cream, never recollecting I throwed sour, I never see world, never, never, never, poor abused boy!” And Mrs. Harper sobbed heart would break. “I hope Tom’s better is,” said Sid, “but would better ways—” “_Sid!_” Tom felt glare old lady’s eye, though could see it. “Not word Tom, gone! God’ll take care _him_—never trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I know give up! I know give up! He comfort me, although tormented old heart me, ’most.” “The Lord giveth Lord hath taken away—Blessed name Lord! But hard—Oh, hard! Only last Saturday Joe busted firecracker right nose I knocked sprawling. Little I know then, soon—Oh, I would hug bless it.” “Yes, yes, yes, I know feel, Mrs. Harper, I know exactly feel. No longer ago yesterday noon, Tom took filled cat full Pain-killer, I think cretur would tear house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom’s head thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But troubles now. And last words I ever heard say reproach—” But memory much old lady, broke entirely down. Tom snuffling, now, himself—and pity anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, putting kindly word time time. He began nobler opinion ever before. Still, sufficiently touched aunt’s grief long rush bed overwhelm joy—and theatrical gorgeousness thing appealed strongly nature, too, resisted lay still. He went listening, gathered odds ends conjectured first boys got drowned taking swim; small raft missed; next, certain boys said missing lads promised village “hear something” soon; wise-heads “put together” decided lads gone raft would turn next town below, presently; toward noon raft found, lodged Missouri shore five six miles village—and hope perished; must drowned, else hunger would driven home nightfall sooner. It believed search bodies fruitless effort merely drowning must occurred mid-channel, since boys, good swimmers, would otherwise escaped shore. This Wednesday night. If bodies continued missing Sunday, hope would given over, funerals would preached morning. Tom shuddered. Mrs. Harper gave sobbing goodnight turned go. Then mutual impulse two bereaved women flung other’s arms good, consoling cry, parted. Aunt Polly tender far beyond not, goodnight Sid Mary. Sid snuffled bit Mary went crying heart. Aunt Polly knelt prayed Tom touchingly, appealingly, measureless love words old trembling voice, weltering tears again, long through. He keep still long went bed, kept making broken-hearted ejaculations time time, tossing unrestfully, turning over. But last still, moaning little sleep. Now boy stole out, rose gradually bedside, shaded candle-light hand, stood regarding her. His heart full pity her. He took sycamore scroll placed candle. But something occurred him, lingered considering. His face lighted happy solution thought; put bark hastily pocket. Then bent kissed faded lips, straightway made stealthy exit, latching door behind him. He threaded way back ferry landing, found nobody large there, walked boldly board boat, knew tenantless except watchman, always turned slept like graven image. He untied skiff stern, slipped it, soon rowing cautiously upstream. When pulled mile village, started quartering across bent stoutly work. He hit landing side neatly, familiar bit work him. He moved capture skiff, arguing might considered ship therefore legitimate prey pirate, knew thorough search would made might end revelations. So stepped ashore entered woods. He sat took long rest, torturing meanwhile keep awake, started warily home-stretch. The night far spent. It broad daylight found fairly abreast island bar. He rested sun well gilding great river splendor, plunged stream. A little later paused, dripping, upon threshold camp, heard Joe say: “No, Tom’s true-blue, Huck, come back. He desert. He knows would disgrace pirate, Tom’s proud sort thing. He something other. Now I wonder what?” “Well, things ours, anyway, they?” “Pretty near, yet, Huck. The writing says back breakfast.” “Which is!” exclaimed Tom, fine dramatic effect, stepping grandly camp. A sumptuous breakfast bacon fish shortly provided, boys set work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) adventures. They vain boastful company heroes tale done. Then Tom hid away shady nook sleep till noon, pirates got ready fish explore. CHAPTER XVI AFTER dinner gang turned hunt turtle eggs bar. They went poking sticks sand, found soft place went knees dug hands. Sometimes would take fifty sixty eggs one hole. They perfectly round white things trifle smaller English walnut. They famous fried-egg feast night, another Friday morning. After breakfast went whooping prancing bar, chased round round, shedding clothes went, naked, continued frolic far away shoal water bar, stiff current, latter tripped legs time time greatly increased fun. And stooped group splashed water other’s faces palms, gradually approaching other, averted faces avoid strangling sprays, finally gripping struggling till best man ducked neighbor, went tangle white legs arms came blowing, sputtering, laughing, gasping breath one time. When well exhausted, would run sprawl dry, hot sand, lie cover it, break water go original performance more. Finally occurred naked skin represented flesh-colored “tights” fairly; drew ring sand circus—with three clowns it, none would yield proudest post neighbor. Next got marbles played “knucks” “ringtaw” “keeps” till amusement grew stale. Then Joe Huck another swim, Tom would venture, found kicking trousers kicked string rattlesnake rattles ankle, wondered escaped cramp long without protection mysterious charm. He venture found it, time boys tired ready rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped “dumps,” fell gazing longingly across wide river village lay drowsing sun. Tom found writing “BECKY” sand big toe; scratched out, angry weakness. But wrote again, nevertheless; could help it. He erased took temptation driving boys together joining them. But Joe’s spirits gone almost beyond resurrection. He homesick could hardly endure misery it. The tears lay near surface. Huck melancholy, too. Tom downhearted, tried hard show it. He secret ready tell, yet, mutinous depression broken soon, would bring out. He said, great show cheerfulness: “I bet pirates island before, boys. We explore again. They hid treasures somewhere. How feel light rotten chest full gold silver—hey?” But roused faint enthusiasm, faded out, reply. Tom tried one two seductions; failed, too. It discouraging work. Joe sat poking sand stick looking gloomy. Finally said: “Oh, boys, let us give up. I want go home. It lonesome.” “Oh no, Joe, feel better by,” said Tom. “Just think fishing here.” “I care fishing. I want go home.” “But, Joe, another swimming-place anywhere.” “Swimming’s good. I seem care it, somehow, anybody say I shall go in. I mean go home.” “Oh, shucks! Baby! You want see mother, I reckon.” “Yes, I _do_ want see mother—and would, too, one. I baby are.” And Joe snuffled little. “Well, let crybaby go home mother, we, Huck? Poor thing—does want see mother? And shall. You like here, you, Huck? We stay, we?” Huck said, “Y-e-s”—without heart it. “I never speak long I live,” said Joe, rising. “There now!” And moved moodily away began dress himself. “Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants to. Go ’long home get laughed at. Oh, nice pirate. Huck crybabies. We stay, we, Huck? Let go wants to. I reckon get along without him, per’aps.” But Tom uneasy, nevertheless, alarmed see Joe go sullenly dressing. And discomforting see Huck eying Joe’s preparations wistfully, keeping ominous silence. Presently, without parting word, Joe began wade toward Illinois shore. Tom’s heart began sink. He glanced Huck. Huck could bear look, dropped eyes. Then said: “I want go, too, Tom. It getting lonesome anyway, worse. Let us us go, too, Tom.” “I not! You go, want to. I mean stay.” “Tom, I better go.” “Well, go ’long—who hendering you.” Huck began pick scattered clothes. He said: “Tom, I wisht would come, too. Now think over. We wait get shore.” “Well, wait blame long time, all.” Huck started sorrowfully away, Tom stood looking him, strong desire tugging heart yield pride go along too. He hoped boys would stop, still waded slowly on. It suddenly dawned Tom become lonely still. He made one final struggle pride, darted comrades, yelling: “Wait! Wait! I want tell something!” They presently stopped turned around. When got were, began unfolding secret, listened moodily till last saw “point” driving at, set warwhoop applause said “splendid!” said told first, would started away. He made plausible excuse; real reason fear even secret would keep great length time, meant hold reserve last seduction. The lads came gayly back went sports will, chattering time Tom’s stupendous plan admiring genius it. After dainty egg fish dinner, Tom said wanted learn smoke, now. Joe caught idea said would like try, too. So Huck made pipes filled them. These novices never smoked anything cigars made grapevine, “bit” tongue, considered manly anyway. Now stretched elbows began puff, charily, slender confidence. The smoke unpleasant taste, gagged little, Tom said: “Why, easy! If I would knowed all, I would learnt long ago.” “So would I,” said Joe. “It nothing.” “Why, many time I looked people smoking, thought well I wish I could that; I never thought I could,” said Tom. “That way me, hain’t it, Huck? You heard talk way—have you, Huck? I leave Huck I not.” “Yes—heaps times,” said Huck. “Well, I too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds times. Once slaughter-house. Do remember, Huck? Bob Tanner there, Johnny Miller, Jeff Thatcher, I said it. Do remember, Huck, ’bout saying that?” “Yes, so,” said Huck. “That day I lost white alley. No, day before.” “There—I told so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.” “I bleeve I could smoke pipe day,” said Joe. “I feel sick.” “Neither I,” said Tom. “I could smoke day. But I bet Jeff Thatcher could not.” “Jeff Thatcher! Why, would keel two draws. Just let try once. _He’d_ see!” “I bet would. And Johnny Miller—I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle once.” “Oh, I!” said Joe. “Why, I bet Johnny Miller could nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.” “’Deed would, Joe. Say—I wish boys could see us now.” “So I.” “Say—boys, say anything it, time around, I come say, ‘Joe, got pipe? I want smoke.’ And say, kind careless like, warn’t anything, say, ‘Yes, I got _old_ pipe, another one, tobacker good.’ And I say, ‘Oh, right, _strong_ enough.’ And pipes, light ca’m, see look!” “By jings, gay, Tom! I wish _now_!” “So I! And tell learned pirating, wish would along?” “Oh, I reckon not! I _bet_ will!” So talk ran on. But presently began flag trifle, grow disjointed. The silences widened; expectoration marvellously increased. Every pore inside boys’ cheeks became spouting fountain; could scarcely bail cellars tongues fast enough prevent inundation; little overflowings throats occurred spite could do, sudden retchings followed every time. Both boys looking pale miserable, now. Joe’s pipe dropped nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both fountains going furiously pumps bailing might main. Joe said feebly: “I lost knife. I reckon I better go find it.” Tom said, quivering lips halting utterance: “I help you. You go way I hunt around spring. No, need come, Huck—we find it.” So Huck sat again, waited hour. Then found lonesome, went find comrades. They wide apart woods, pale, fast asleep. But something informed trouble got rid it. They talkative supper night. They humble look, Huck prepared pipe meal going prepare theirs, said no, feeling well—something ate dinner disagreed them. About midnight Joe awoke, called boys. There brooding oppressiveness air seemed bode something. The boys huddled together sought friendly companionship fire, though dull dead heat breathless atmosphere stifling. They sat still, intent waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond light fire everything swallowed blackness darkness. Presently came quivering glow vaguely revealed foliage moment vanished. By another came, little stronger. Then another. Then faint moan came sighing branches forest boys felt fleeting breath upon cheeks, shuddered fancy Spirit Night gone by. There pause. Now weird flash turned night day showed every little grassblade, separate distinct, grew feet. And showed three white, startled faces, too. A deep peal thunder went rolling tumbling heavens lost sullen rumblings distance. A sweep chilly air passed by, rustling leaves snowing flaky ashes broadcast fire. Another fierce glare lit forest instant crash followed seemed rend treetops right boys’ heads. They clung together terror, thick gloom followed. A big raindrops fell pattering upon leaves. “Quick! boys, go tent!” exclaimed Tom. They sprang away, stumbling roots among vines dark, two plunging direction. A furious blast roared trees, making everything sing went. One blinding flash another came, peal peal deafening thunder. And drenching rain poured rising hurricane drove sheets along ground. The boys cried other, roaring wind booming thunderblasts drowned voices utterly. However, one one straggled last took shelter tent, cold, scared, streaming water; company misery seemed something grateful for. They could talk, old sail flapped furiously, even noises would allowed them. The tempest rose higher higher, presently sail tore loose fastenings went winging away blast. The boys seized others’ hands fled, many tumblings bruises, shelter great oak stood upon riverbank. Now battle highest. Under ceaseless conflagration lightning flamed skies, everything stood cleancut shadowless distinctness: bending trees, billowy river, white foam, driving spray spumeflakes, dim outlines high bluffs side, glimpsed drifting cloudrack slanting veil rain. Every little giant tree yielded fight fell crashing younger growth; unflagging thunderpeals came ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen sharp, unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated one matchless effort seemed likely tear island pieces, burn up, drown treetops, blow away, deafen every creature it, one moment. It wild night homeless young heads in. But last battle done, forces retired weaker weaker threatenings grumblings, peace resumed sway. The boys went back camp, good deal awed; found still something thankful for, great sycamore, shelter beds, ruin, now, blasted lightnings, catastrophe happened. Everything camp drenched, campfire well; heedless lads, like generation, made provision rain. Here matter dismay, soaked chilled. They eloquent distress; presently discovered fire eaten far great log built (where curved upward separated ground), handbreadth escaped wetting; patiently wrought until, shreds bark gathered sides sheltered logs, coaxed fire burn again. Then piled great dead boughs till roaring furnace, gladhearted more. They dried boiled ham feast, sat fire expanded glorified midnight adventure morning, dry spot sleep on, anywhere around. As sun began steal upon boys, drowsiness came them, went sandbar lay sleep. They got scorched by, drearily set getting breakfast. After meal felt rusty, stiff-jointed, little homesick more. Tom saw signs, fell cheering pirates well could. But cared nothing marbles, circus, swimming, anything. He reminded imposing secret, raised ray cheer. While lasted, got interested new device. This knock pirates, while, Indians change. They attracted idea; long stripped, striped head heel black mud, like many zebras—all chiefs, course—and went tearing woods attack English settlement. By separated three hostile tribes, darted upon ambush dreadful warwhoops, killed scalped thousands. It gory day. Consequently extremely satisfactory one. They assembled camp toward suppertime, hungry happy; difficulty arose—hostile Indians could break bread hospitality together without first making peace, simple impossibility without smoking pipe peace. There process ever heard of. Two savages almost wished remained pirates. However, way; show cheerfulness could muster called pipe took whiff passed, due form. And behold, glad gone savagery, gained something; found could smoke little without go hunt lost knife; get sick enough seriously uncomfortable. They likely fool away high promise lack effort. No, practised cautiously, supper, right fair success, spent jubilant evening. They prouder happier new acquirement would scalping skinning Six Nations. We leave smoke chatter brag, since use present. CHAPTER XVII BUT hilarity little town tranquil Saturday afternoon. The Harpers, Aunt Polly’s family, put mourning, great grief many tears. An unusual quiet possessed village, although ordinarily quiet enough, conscience. The villagers conducted concerns absent air, talked little; sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed burden children. They heart sports, gradually gave up. In afternoon Becky Thatcher found moping deserted schoolhouse yard, feeling melancholy. But found nothing comfort her. She soliloquized: “Oh, I brass andiron-knob again! But I got anything remember by.” And choked back little sob. Presently stopped, said herself: “It right here. Oh, again, I would say that—I would say whole world. But gone now; I never, never, never see more.” This thought broke down, wandered away, tears rolling cheeks. Then quite group boys girls—playmates Tom’s Joe’s—came by, stood looking paling fence talking reverent tones Tom so-and-so last time saw him, Joe said small trifle (pregnant awful prophecy, could easily see now!)—and speaker pointed exact spot lost lads stood time, added something like “and I a-standing so—just I now, him—I close that—and smiled, way—and something seemed go me, like—awful, know—and I never thought meant, course, I see now!” Then dispute saw dead boys last life, many claimed dismal distinction, offered evidences, less tampered witness; ultimately decided _did_ see departed last, exchanged last words them, lucky parties took upon sort sacred importance, gaped envied rest. One poor chap, grandeur offer, said tolerably manifest pride remembrance: “Well, Tom Sawyer licked once.” But bid glory failure. Most boys could say that, cheapened distinction much. The group loitered away, still recalling memories lost heroes, awed voices. When Sunday-school hour finished, next morning, bell began toll, instead ringing usual way. It still Sabbath, mournful sound seemed keeping musing hush lay upon nature. The villagers began gather, loitering moment vestibule converse whispers sad event. But whispering house; funereal rustling dresses women gathered seats disturbed silence there. None could remember little church full before. There finally waiting pause, expectant dumbness, Aunt Polly entered, followed Sid Mary, Harper family, deep black, whole congregation, old minister well, rose reverently stood mourners seated front pew. There another communing silence, broken intervals muffled sobs, minister spread hands abroad prayed. A moving hymn sung, text followed: “I Resurrection Life.” As service proceeded, clergyman drew pictures graces, winning ways, rare promise lost lads every soul there, thinking recognized pictures, felt pang remembering persistently blinded always before, persistently seen faults flaws poor boys. The minister related many touching incident lives departed, too, illustrated sweet, generous natures, people could easily see, now, noble beautiful episodes were, remembered grief time occurred seemed rank rascalities, well deserving cowhide. The congregation became moved, pathetic tale went on, till last whole company broke joined weeping mourners chorus anguished sobs, preacher giving way feelings, crying pulpit. There rustle gallery, nobody noticed; moment later church door creaked; minister raised streaming eyes handkerchief, stood transfixed! First one another pair eyes followed minister’s, almost one impulse congregation rose stared three dead boys came marching aisle, Tom lead, Joe next, Huck, ruin drooping rags, sneaking sheepishly rear! They hid unused gallery listening funeral sermon! Aunt Polly, Mary, Harpers threw upon restored ones, smothered kisses poured thanksgivings, poor Huck stood abashed uncomfortable, knowing exactly hide many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, started slink away, Tom seized said: “Aunt Polly, fair. Somebody got glad see Huck.” “And shall. I glad see him, poor motherless thing!” And loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon one thing capable making uncomfortable before. Suddenly minister shouted top voice: “Praise God blessings flow—_sing_!—and put hearts it!” And did. Old Hundred swelled triumphant burst, shook rafters Tom Sawyer Pirate looked around upon envying juveniles confessed heart proudest moment life. As “sold” congregation trooped said would almost willing made ridiculous hear Old Hundred sung like more. Tom got cuffs kisses day—according Aunt Polly’s varying moods—than earned year; hardly knew expressed gratefulness God affection himself. CHAPTER XVIII THAT Tom’s great secret—the scheme return home brother pirates attend funerals. They paddled Missouri shore log, dusk Saturday, landing five six miles village; slept woods edge town till nearly daylight, crept back lanes alleys finished sleep gallery church among chaos invalided benches. At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly Mary loving Tom, attentive wants. There unusual amount talk. In course Aunt Polly said: “Well, I say fine joke, Tom, keep everybody suffering ’most week boys good time, pity could hard-hearted let suffer so. If could come log go funeral, could come give hint way warn’t dead, run off.” “Yes, could done that, Tom,” said Mary; “and I believe would thought it.” “Would you, Tom?” said Aunt Polly, face lighting wistfully. “Say, now, would you, would thought it?” “I—well, I know. ’Twould ’a’ spoiled everything.” “Tom, I hoped loved much,” said Aunt Polly, grieved tone discomforted boy. “It would something would cared enough _think_ it, even _do_ it.” “Now, auntie, harm,” pleaded Mary; “it Tom’s giddy way—he always rush never thinks anything.” “More’s pity. Sid would thought. And Sid would come _done_ it, too. Tom, look back, day, late, wish would cared little would cost little.” “Now, auntie, know I care you,” said Tom. “I would know better acted like it.” “I wish I would thought,” said Tom, repentant tone; “but I dreamt you, anyway. That something, it?” “It much—a cat much—but better nothing. What dream?” “Why, Wednesday night I dreamt sitting bed, Sid sitting woodbox, Mary next him.” “Well, did. So always do. I glad dreams could take even much trouble us.” “And I dreamt Joe Harper’s mother here.” “Why, here! Did dream more?” “Oh, lots. But dim, now.” “Well, try recollect—cannot you?” “Somehow seems wind—the wind blowed the—the—” “Try harder, Tom! The wind blow something. Come!” Tom pressed fingers forehead anxious minute, said: “I got now! I got now! It blowed candle!” “Mercy us! Go on, Tom—go on!” “And seems said, ‘Why, I believe door—’” “Go _on_, Tom!” “Just let study moment—just moment. Oh, yes—you said believed door open.” “As I sitting here, I did! Did I, Mary! Go on!” “And then—and then—well I certain, seems like made Sid go and—and—” “Well? Well? What I make do, Tom? What I make do?” “You made him—you—Oh, made shut it.” “Well, land’s sake! I never heard beat days! Do tell _me_ anything dreams, more. Sereny Harper shall know I hour older. I would like see get around _this_ rubbage ’bout superstition. Go on, Tom!” “Oh, getting bright day, now. Next said I warn’t _bad_, mischeevous harum-scarum, responsible than—than—I think colt, something.” “And was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!” “And began cry.” “So I did. So I did. Not first time, neither. And then—” “Then Mrs. Harper began cry, said Joe same, wished whipped taking cream would throwed self—” “Tom! The sperrit upon you! You prophesying—that doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!” “Then Sid said—he said—” “I think I said anything,” said Sid. “Yes did, Sid,” said Mary. “Shut heads let Tom go on! What say, Tom?” “He said—I _think_ said hoped I better I gone to, I would better sometimes—” “_There_, d’you hear that! It words!” “And shut sharp.” “I lay I did! There must ’a’ angel there. There _was_ angel there, somewheres!” “And Mrs. Harper told Joe scaring firecracker, told Peter Pain-killer—” “Just true I live!” “And whole lot talk ’bout dragging river us, ’bout funeral Sunday, old Miss Harper hugged cried, went.” “It happened so! It happened so, sure I a-sitting tracks. Tom, could told like would ’a’ seen it! And what? Go on, Tom!” “Then I thought prayed me—and I could see hear every word said. And went bed, I sorry I took wrote piece sycamore bark, ‘We dead—we pirates,’ put table candle; looked good, laying asleep, I thought I went leaned kissed lips.” “Did you, Tom, _did_ you! I forgive everything that!” And seized boy crushing embrace made feel like guiltiest villains. “It kind, even though a—dream,” Sid soliloquized audibly. “Shut up, Sid! A body dream would awake. Here big Milum apple I saving you, Tom, ever found again—now go ’long school. I thankful good God Father us I got back, long-suffering merciful believe Him keep His word, though goodness knows I unworthy it, worthy ones got His blessings His hand help rough places, enough would smile ever enter His rest long night comes. Go ’long Sid, Mary, Tom—take off—you hendered long enough.” The children left school, old lady call Mrs. Harper vanquish realism Tom’s marvellous dream. Sid better judgment utter thought mind left house. It this: “Pretty thin—as long dream that, without mistakes it!” What hero Tom become, now! He go skipping prancing, moved dignified swagger became pirate felt public eye him. And indeed was; tried seem see looks hear remarks passed along, food drink him. Smaller boys flocked heels, proud seen him, tolerated him, drummer head procession elephant leading menagerie town. Boys size pretended know away all; consuming envy, nevertheless. They would given anything swarthy sun-tanned skin his, glittering notoriety; Tom would parted either circus. At school children made much Joe, delivered eloquent admiration eyes, two heroes long becoming insufferably “stuck-up.” They began tell adventures hungry listeners—but began; thing likely end, imaginations like furnish material. And finally, got pipes went serenely puffing around, summit glory reached. Tom decided could independent Becky Thatcher now. Glory sufficient. He would live glory. Now distinguished, maybe would wanting “make up.” Well, let her—she see could indifferent people. Presently arrived. Tom pretended see her. He moved away joined group boys girls began talk. Soon observed tripping gayly back forth flushed face dancing eyes, pretending busy chasing schoolmates, screaming laughter made capture; noticed always made captures vicinity, seemed cast conscious eye direction times, too. It gratified vicious vanity him; so, instead winning him, “set up” made diligent avoid betraying knew about. Presently gave skylarking, moved irresolutely about, sighing twice glancing furtively wistfully toward Tom. Then observed Tom talking particularly Amy Lawrence one else. She felt sharp pang grew disturbed uneasy once. She tried go away, feet treacherous, carried group instead. She said girl almost Tom’s elbow—with sham vivacity: “Why, Mary Austin! bad girl, come Sunday-school?” “I come—did see me?” “Why, no! Did you? Where sit?” “I Miss Peters’ class, I always go. I saw _you_.” “Did you? Why, funny I see you. I wanted tell picnic.” “Oh, jolly. Who going give it?” “My ma’s going let one.” “Oh, goody; I hope let _me_ come.” “Well, will. The picnic’s me. She let anybody come I want, I want you.” “That ever nice. When going be?” “By by. Maybe vacation.” “Oh, fun! You going girls boys?” “Yes, every one friends me—or wants be”; glanced ever furtively Tom, talked right along Amy Lawrence terrible storm island, lightning tore great sycamore tree “all flinders” “standing within three feet it.” “Oh, may I come?” said Grace Miller. “Yes.” “And me?” said Sally Rogers. “Yes.” “And me, too?” said Susy Harper. “And Joe?” “Yes.” And on, clapping joyful hands till group begged invitations Tom Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking, took Amy him. Becky’s lips trembled tears came eyes; hid signs forced gayety went chattering, life gone picnic, now, everything else; got away soon could hid sex call “a good cry.” Then sat moody, wounded pride, till bell rang. She roused up, now, vindictive cast eye, gave plaited tails shake said knew _she’d_ do. At recess Tom continued flirtation Amy jubilant self-satisfaction. And kept drifting find Becky lacerate performance. At last spied her, sudden falling mercury. She sitting cosily little bench behind schoolhouse looking picture-book Alfred Temple—and absorbed they, heads close together book, seem conscious anything world besides. Jealousy ran red-hot Tom’s veins. He began hate throwing away chance Becky offered reconciliation. He called fool, hard names could think of. He wanted cry vexation. Amy chatted happily along, walked, heart singing, Tom’s tongue lost function. He hear Amy saying, whenever paused expectantly could stammer awkward assent, often misplaced otherwise. He kept drifting rear schoolhouse, again, sear eyeballs hateful spectacle there. He could help it. And maddened see, thought saw, Becky Thatcher never suspected even land living. But see, nevertheless; knew winning fight, too, glad see suffer suffered. Amy’s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted things attend to; things must done; time fleeting. But vain—the girl chirped on. Tom thought, “Oh, hang her, I ever going get rid her?” At last must attending things—and said artlessly would “around” school let out. And hastened away, hating it. “Any boy!” Tom thought, grating teeth. “Any boy whole town Saint Louis smarty thinks dresses fine aristocracy! Oh, right, I licked first day ever saw town, mister, I lick again! You wait till I catch out! I take and—” And went motions thrashing imaginary boy—pummelling air, kicking gouging. “Oh, do, you? You holler ’nough, you? Now, then, let learn you!” And imaginary flogging finished satisfaction. Tom fled home noon. His conscience could endure Amy’s grateful happiness, jealousy could bear distress. Becky resumed picture inspections Alfred, minutes dragged along Tom came suffer, triumph began cloud lost interest; gravity absentmindedness followed, melancholy; two three times pricked ear footstep, false hope; Tom came. At last grew entirely miserable wished carried far. When poor Alfred, seeing losing her, know how, kept exclaiming: “Oh, jolly one! look this!” lost patience last, said, “Oh, bother me! I care them!” burst tears, got walked away. Alfred dropped alongside going try comfort her, said: “Go away leave alone, cannot you! I hate you!” So boy halted, wondering could done—for said would look pictures nooning—and walked on, crying. Then Alfred went musing deserted schoolhouse. He humiliated angry. He easily guessed way truth—the girl simply made convenience vent spite upon Tom Sawyer. He far hating Tom less thought occurred him. He wished way get boy trouble without much risk himself. Tom’s spelling-book fell eye. Here opportunity. He gratefully opened lesson afternoon poured ink upon page. Becky, glancing window behind moment, saw act, moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now, intending find Tom tell him; Tom would thankful troubles would healed. Before half way home, however, changed mind. The thought Tom’s treatment talking picnic came scorching back filled shame. She resolved let get whipped damaged spelling-book’s account, hate forever, bargain. CHAPTER XIX TOM arrived home dreary mood, first thing aunt said showed brought sorrows unpromising market: “Tom, I notion skin alive!” “Auntie, I done?” “Well, done enough. Here I go Sereny Harper, like old softy, expecting I going make believe rubbage dream, lo behold would found Joe heard talk night. Tom, I know become boy act like that. It makes feel bad think could let go Sereny Harper make fool never say word.” This new aspect thing. His smartness morning seemed Tom good joke before, ingenious. It merely looked mean shabby now. He hung head could think anything say moment. Then said: “Auntie, I wish I done it—but I think.” “Oh, child, never think. You never think anything selfishness. You could think come way Jackson’s Island night laugh troubles, could think fool lie dream; could ever think pity us save us sorrow.” “Auntie, I know mean, I mean mean. I not, honest. And besides, I come laugh night.” “What come for, then?” “It tell uneasy us, got drownded.” “Tom, Tom, I would thankfullest soul world I could believe ever good thought that, know never did—and I know it, Tom.” “Indeed ’deed I did, auntie—I wish I may never stir I not.” “Oh, Tom, lie—do it. It makes things hundred times worse.” “It lie, auntie; truth. I wanted keep grieving—that made come.” “I would give whole world believe that—it would cover power sins, Tom. I would ’most glad would run acted bad. But reasonable; because, tell me, child?” “Why, see, got talking funeral, I got full idea coming hiding church, I could somehow bear spoil it. So I put bark back pocket kept mum.” “What bark?” “The bark I wrote tell would gone pirating. I wish, now, would waked I kissed you—I do, honest.” The hard lines aunt’s face relaxed sudden tenderness dawned eyes. “_Did_ kiss me, Tom?” “Why, yes, I did.” “Are sure did, Tom?” “Why, yes, I did, auntie—certain sure.” “What kiss for, Tom?” “Because I loved so, laid moaning I sorry.” The words sounded like truth. The old lady could hide tremor voice said: “Kiss again, Tom!—and school, now, bother more.” The moment gone, ran closet got ruin jacket Tom gone pirating in. Then stopped, hand, said herself: “No, I dare. Poor boy, I reckon lied it—but blessed, blessed lie, comfort come it. I hope Lord—I _know_ Lord forgive him, good-heartedness tell it. But I want find lie. I look.” She put jacket away, stood musing minute. Twice put hand take garment again, twice refrained. Once ventured, time fortified thought: “It good lie—it good lie—I let grieve me.” So sought jacket pocket. A moment later reading Tom’s piece bark flowing tears saying: “I could forgive boy, now, would committed million sins!” CHAPTER XX THERE something Aunt Polly’s manner, kissed Tom, swept away low spirits made lighthearted happy again. He started school luck coming upon Becky Thatcher head Meadow Lane. His mood always determined manner. Without moment’s hesitation ran said: “I acted mighty mean today, Becky, I sorry. I ever, ever way again, long ever I live—please make up, you?” The girl stopped looked scornfully face: “I thank keep _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I never speak again.” She tossed head passed on. Tom stunned even presence mind enough say “Who cares, Miss Smarty?” right time say gone by. So said nothing. But fine rage, nevertheless. He moped schoolyard wishing boy, imagining would trounce were. He presently encountered delivered stinging remark passed. She hurled one return, angry breach complete. It seemed Becky, hot resentment, could hardly wait school “take in,” impatient see Tom flogged injured spelling-book. If lingering notion exposing Alfred Temple, Tom’s offensive fling driven entirely away. Poor girl, know fast nearing trouble herself. The master, Mr. Dobbins, reached middle age unsatisfied ambition. The darling desires was, doctor, poverty decreed nothing higher village schoolmaster. Every day took mysterious book desk absorbed times classes reciting. He kept book lock key. There urchin school perishing glimpse it, chance never came. Every boy girl theory nature book; two theories alike, way getting facts case. Now, Becky passing desk, stood near door, noticed key lock! It precious moment. She glanced around; found alone, next instant book hands. The titlepage—Professor Somebody _Anatomy_—carried information mind; began turn leaves. She came upon handsomely engraved colored frontispiece—a human figure, stark naked. At moment shadow fell page Tom Sawyer stepped door caught glimpse picture. Becky snatched book close it, hard luck tear pictured page half middle. She thrust volume desk, turned key, burst crying shame vexation. “Tom Sawyer, mean be, sneak person look looking at.” “How could I know looking anything?” “You ought ashamed yourself, Tom Sawyer; know going tell me, oh, shall I do, shall I do! I whipped, I never whipped school.” Then stamped little foot said: “_Be_ mean want to! I know something going happen. You wait see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!”—and flung house new explosion crying. Tom stood still, rather flustered onslaught. Presently said himself: “What curious kind fool girl is! Never licked school! Shucks! What licking! That like girl—they thin-skinned chicken-hearted. Well, course I going tell old Dobbins little fool, ways getting even her, mean; it? Old Dobbins ask tore book. Nobody’ll answer. Then way always does—ask first one t’other, comes right girl know it, without telling. Girls’ faces always tell them. They got backbone. She get licked. Well, kind tight place Becky Thatcher, way it.” Tom conned thing moment longer, added: “All right, though; would like see fix—let sweat out!” Tom joined mob skylarking scholars outside. In moments master arrived school “took in.” Tom feel strong interest studies. Every time stole glance girls’ side room Becky’s face troubled him. Considering things, want pity her, yet could help it. He could get exultation really worthy name. Presently spelling-book discovery made, Tom’s mind entirely full matters that. Becky roused lethargy distress showed good interest proceedings. She expect Tom could get trouble denying spilt ink book himself; right. The denial seemed make thing worse Tom. Becky supposed would glad that, tried believe glad it, found certain. When worst came worst, impulse get tell Alfred Temple, made effort forced keep still—because, said herself, “he tell tearing picture sure. I would say word, save life!” Tom took whipping went back seat broken-hearted, thought possible unknowingly upset ink spelling-book himself, skylarking bout—he denied form’s sake custom, stuck denial principle. A whole hour drifted by, master sat nodding throne, air drowsy hum study. By by, Mr. Dobbins straightened up, yawned, unlocked desk, reached book, seemed undecided whether take leave it. Most pupils glanced languidly, two among watched movements intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered book absently while, took settled chair read! Tom shot glance Becky. He seen hunted helpless rabbit look did, gun levelled head. Instantly forgot quarrel her. Quick—something must done! done flash, too! But imminence emergency paralyzed invention. Good!—he inspiration! He would run snatch book, spring door fly. But resolution shook one little instant, chance lost—the master opened volume. If Tom wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There help Becky now, said. The next moment master faced school. Every eye sank gaze. There smote even innocent fear. There silence one might count ten—the master gathering wrath. Then spoke: “Who tore book?” There sound. One could heard pin drop. The stillness continued; master searched face face signs guilt. “Benjamin Rogers, tear book?” A denial. Another pause. “Joseph Harper, you?” Another denial. Tom’s uneasiness grew intense slow torture proceedings. The master scanned ranks boys—considered while, turned girls: “Amy Lawrence?” A shake head. “Gracie Miller?” The sign. “Susan Harper, this?” Another negative. The next girl Becky Thatcher. Tom trembling head foot excitement sense hopelessness situation. “Rebecca Thatcher” [Tom glanced face—it white terror]—“did tear—no, look face” [her hands rose appeal]—“did tear book?” A thought shot like lightning Tom’s brain. He sprang feet shouted—“I done it!” The school stared perplexity incredible folly. Tom stood moment, gather dismembered faculties; stepped forward go punishment surprise, gratitude, adoration shone upon poor Becky’s eyes seemed pay enough hundred floggings. Inspired splendor act, took without outcry merciless flaying even Mr. Dobbins ever administered; also received indifference added cruelty command remain two hours school dismissed—for knew would wait outside till captivity done, count tedious time loss, either. Tom went bed night planning vengeance Alfred Temple; shame repentance Becky told all, forgetting treachery; even longing vengeance give way, soon, pleasanter musings, fell asleep last Becky’s latest words lingering dreamily ear— “Tom, _could_ noble!” CHAPTER XXI VACATION approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer exacting ever, wanted school make good showing “Examination” day. His rod ferule seldom idle now—at least among smaller pupils. Only biggest boys, young ladies eighteen twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins’ lashings vigorous ones, too; although carried, wig, perfectly bald shiny head, reached middle age, sign feebleness muscle. As great day approached, tyranny came surface; seemed take vindictive pleasure punishing least shortcomings. The consequence was, smaller boys spent days terror suffering nights plotting revenge. They threw away opportunity master mischief. But kept ahead time. The retribution followed every vengeful success sweeping majestic boys always retired field badly worsted. At last conspired together hit upon plan promised dazzling victory. They swore signpainter’s boy, told scheme, asked help. He reasons delighted, master boarded father’s family given boy ample hate him. The master’s wife would go visit country days, would nothing interfere plan; master always prepared great occasions getting pretty well fuddled, signpainter’s boy said dominie reached proper condition Examination Evening would “manage thing” napped chair; would awakened right time hurried away school. In fulness time interesting occasion arrived. At eight evening schoolhouse brilliantly lighted, adorned wreaths festoons foliage flowers. The master sat throned great chair upon raised platform, blackboard behind him. He looking tolerably mellow. Three rows benches side six rows front occupied dignitaries town parents pupils. To left, back rows citizens, spacious temporary platform upon seated scholars take part exercises evening; rows small boys, washed dressed intolerable state discomfort; rows gawky big boys; snowbanks girls young ladies clad lawn muslin conspicuously conscious bare arms, grandmothers’ ancient trinkets, bits pink blue ribbon flowers hair. All rest house filled non-participating scholars. The exercises began. A little boy stood sheepishly recited, “You would scarce expect one age speak public stage,” etc.—accompanying painfully exact spasmodic gestures machine might used—supposing machine trifle order. But got safely, though cruelly scared, got fine round applause made manufactured bow retired. A little shamefaced girl lisped, “Mary little lamb,” etc., performed compassion-inspiring curtsy, got meed applause, sat flushed happy. Tom Sawyer stepped forward conceited confidence soared unquenchable indestructible “Give liberty give death” speech, fine fury frantic gesticulation, broke middle it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, legs quaked like choke. True, manifest sympathy house house’s silence, too, even worse sympathy. The master frowned, completed disaster. Tom struggled awhile retired, utterly defeated. There weak attempt applause, died early. “The Boy Stood Burning Deck” followed; also “The Assyrian Came Down,” declamatory gems. Then reading exercises, spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited honor. The prime feature evening order, now—original “compositions” young ladies. Each turn stepped forward edge platform, cleared throat, held manuscript (tied dainty ribbon), proceeded read, labored attention “expression” punctuation. The themes illuminated upon similar occasions mothers them, grandmothers, doubtless ancestors female line clear back Crusades. “Friendship” one; “Memories Other Days”; “Religion History”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages Culture”; “Forms Political Government Compared Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart Longings,” etc., etc. A prevalent feature compositions nursed petted melancholy; another wasteful opulent gush “fine language”; another tendency lug ears particularly prized words phrases worn entirely out; peculiarity conspicuously marked marred inveterate intolerable sermon wagged crippled tail end every one them. No matter subject might be, brainracking effort made squirm aspect moral religious mind could contemplate edification. The glaring insincerity sermons sufficient compass banishment fashion schools, sufficient today; never sufficient world stands, perhaps. There school land young ladies feel obliged close compositions sermon; find sermon frivolous least religious girl school always longest relentlessly pious. But enough this. Homely truth unpalatable. Let us return “Examination.” The first composition read one entitled “Is this, then, Life?” Perhaps reader endure extract it: “In common walks life, delightful emotions youthful mind look forward anticipated scene festivity! Imagination busy sketching rose-tinted pictures joy. In fancy, voluptuous votary fashion sees amid festive throng, ‘the observed observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed snowy robes, whirling mazes joyous dance; eye brightest, step lightest gay assembly. “In delicious fancies time quickly glides by, welcome hour arrives entrance Elysian world, bright dreams. How fairy-like everything appear enchanted vision! Each new scene charming last. But finds beneath goodly exterior, vanity, flattery charmed soul, grates harshly upon ear; ballroom lost charms; wasted health imbittered heart, turns away conviction earthly pleasures cannot satisfy longings soul!” And forth on. There buzz gratification time time reading, accompanied whispered ejaculations “How sweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!” etc., thing closed peculiarly afflicting sermon applause enthusiastic. Then arose slim, melancholy girl, whose face “interesting” paleness comes pills indigestion, read “poem.” Two stanzas do: “A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA “Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well! But yet I leave thee now! Sad, yes, sad thoughts thee heart doth swell, And burning recollections throng brow! For I wandered thy flowery woods; Have roamed read near Tallapoosa’s stream; Have listened Tallassee’s warring floods, And wooed Coosa’s side Aurora’s beam. “Yet shame I bear o’erfull heart, Nor blush turn behind tearful eyes; It Is stranger land I must part, It Is strangers left I yield sighs. Welcome home mine within State, Whose vales I leave—whose spires fade fast And cold must mine eyes, heart, tete, When, dear Alabama! turn cold thee!” There knew “tete” meant, poem satisfactory, nevertheless. Next appeared dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, paused impressive moment, assumed tragic expression, began read measured, solemn tone: “A VISION “Dark tempestuous night. Around throne high single star quivered; deep intonations heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon ear; whilst terrific lightning revelled angry mood cloudy chambers heaven, seeming scorn power exerted terror illustrious Franklin! Even boisterous winds unanimously came forth mystic homes, blustered enhance aid wildness scene. “At time, dark, dreary, human sympathy spirit sighed; instead thereof, “‘My dearest friend, counsellor, comforter guide—My joy grief, second bliss joy,’ came side. She moved like one bright beings pictured sunny walks fancy’s Eden romantic young, queen beauty unadorned save transcendent loveliness. So soft step, failed make even sound, magical thrill imparted genial touch, unobtrusive beauties, would glided away unperceived—unsought. A strange sadness rested upon features, like icy tears upon robe December, pointed contending elements without, bade contemplate two beings presented.” This nightmare occupied ten pages manuscript wound sermon destructive hope non-Presbyterians took first prize. This composition considered finest effort evening. The mayor village, delivering prize author it, made warm speech said far “eloquent” thing ever listened to, Daniel Webster might well proud it. It may remarked, passing, number compositions word “beauteous” over-fondled, human experience referred “life’s page,” usual average. Now master, mellow almost verge geniality, put chair aside, turned back audience, began draw map America blackboard, exercise geography class upon. But made sad business unsteady hand, smothered titter rippled house. He knew matter was, set right it. He sponged lines remade them; distorted ever, tittering pronounced. He threw entire attention upon work, now, determined put mirth. He felt eyes fastened upon him; imagined succeeding, yet tittering continued; even manifestly increased. And well might. There garret above, pierced scuttle head; scuttle came cat, suspended around haunches string; rag tied head jaws keep mewing; slowly descended curved upward clawed string, swung downward clawed intangible air. The tittering rose higher higher—the cat within six inches absorbed teacher’s head—down, down, little lower, grabbed wig desperate claws, clung it, snatched garret instant trophy still possession! And light blaze abroad master’s bald pate—for signpainter’s boy _gilded_ it! That broke meeting. The boys avenged. Vacation come. NOTE:—The pretended “compositions” quoted chapter taken without alteration volume entitled “Prose Poetry, Western Lady”—but exactly precisely schoolgirl pattern, hence much happier mere imitations could be. CHAPTER XXII TOM joined new order Cadets Temperance, attracted showy character “regalia.” He promised abstain smoking, chewing, profanity long remained member. Now found new thing—namely, promise thing surest way world make body want go thing. Tom soon found tormented desire drink swear; desire grew intense nothing hope chance display red sash kept withdrawing order. Fourth July coming; soon gave up—gave worn shackles forty-eight hours—and fixed hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice peace, apparently deathbed would big public funeral, since high official. During three days Tom deeply concerned Judge’s condition hungry news it. Sometimes hopes ran high—so high would venture get regalia practise looking-glass. But Judge discouraging way fluctuating. At last pronounced upon mend—and convalescent. Tom disgusted; felt sense injury, too. He handed resignation once—and night Judge suffered relapse died. Tom resolved would never trust man like again. The funeral fine thing. The Cadets paraded style calculated kill late member envy. Tom free boy again, however—there something that. He could drink swear, now—but found surprise want to. The simple fact could, took desire away, charm it. Tom presently wondered find coveted vacation beginning hang little heavily hands. He attempted diary—but nothing happened three days, abandoned it. The first negro minstrel shows came town, made sensation. Tom Joe Harper got band performers happy two days. Even Glorious Fourth sense failure, rained hard, procession consequence, greatest man world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, actual United States Senator, proved overwhelming disappointment—for twenty-five feet high, even anywhere neighborhood it. A circus came. The boys played circus three days afterward tents made rag carpeting—admission, three pins boys, two girls—and circusing abandoned. A phrenologist mesmerizer came—and went left village duller drearier ever. There boys-and-girls’ parties, delightful made aching voids ache harder. Becky Thatcher gone Constantinople home stay parents vacation—so bright side life anywhere. The dreadful secret murder chronic misery. It cancer permanency pain. Then came measles. During two long weeks Tom lay prisoner, dead world happenings. He ill, interested nothing. When got upon feet last moved feebly downtown, melancholy change come everything every creature. There “revival,” everybody “got religion,” adults, even boys girls. Tom went about, hoping hope sight one blessed sinful face, disappointment crossed everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying Testament, turned sadly away depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, found visiting poor basket tracts. He hunted Jim Hollis, called attention precious blessing late measles warning. Every boy encountered added another ton depression; when, desperation, flew refuge last bosom Huckleberry Finn received Scriptural quotation, heart broke crept home bed realizing alone town lost, forever forever. And night came terrific storm, driving rain, awful claps thunder blinding sheets lightning. He covered head bedclothes waited horror suspense doom; shadow doubt hubbub him. He believed taxed forbearance powers extremity endurance result. It might seemed waste pomp ammunition kill bug battery artillery, seemed nothing incongruous getting expensive thunderstorm knock turf insect like himself. By tempest spent died without accomplishing object. The boy’s first impulse grateful, reform. His second wait—for might storms. The next day doctors back; Tom relapsed. The three weeks spent back time seemed entire age. When got abroad last hardly grateful spared, remembering lonely estate, companionless forlorn was. He drifted listlessly street found Jim Hollis acting judge juvenile court trying cat murder, presence victim, bird. He found Joe Harper Huck Finn alley eating stolen melon. Poor lads! they—like Tom—had suffered relapse. CHAPTER XXIII AT last sleepy atmosphere stirred—and vigorously: murder trial came court. It became absorbing topic village talk immediately. Tom could get away it. Every reference murder sent shudder heart, troubled conscience fears almost persuaded remarks put forth hearing “feelers”; see could suspected knowing anything murder, still could comfortable midst gossip. It kept cold shiver time. He took Huck lonely place talk him. It would relief unseal tongue little while; divide burden distress another sufferer. Moreover, wanted assure Huck remained discreet. “Huck, ever told anybody about—that?” “’Bout what?” “You know what.” “Oh—’course I not.” “Never word?” “Never solitary word, help me. What makes ask?” “Well, I afeard.” “Why, Tom Sawyer, would alive two days got found out. _You_ know that.” Tom felt comfortable. After pause: “Huck, could anybody get tell, could they?” “Get tell? Why, I wanted halfbreed devil drownd could get tell. They different way.” “Well, right, then. I reckon safe long keep mum. But let us swear again, anyway. It surer.” “I agreed.” So swore dread solemnities. “What talk around, Huck? I heard power it.” “Talk? Well, Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter time. It keeps sweat, constant, I want hide som’ers.” “That way go round me. I reckon goner. Do feel sorry him, sometimes?” “Most always—most always. He account; hain’t ever done anything hurt anybody. Just fishes little, get money get drunk on—and loafs around considerable; lord, that—leastways us—preachers like. But kind good—he give half fish, once, warn’t enough two; lots times kind stood I luck.” “Well, mended kites me, Huck, knitted hooks line. I wish could get there.” “My! could get out, Tom. And besides, ’twouldn’t good; would ketch again.” “Yes—so would. But I hate hear abuse like dickens never done—that.” “I too, Tom. Lord, I hear say bloodiest looking villain country, wonder ever hung before.” “Yes, talk like that, time. I heard say get free would lynch him.” “And would it, too.” The boys long talk, brought little comfort. As twilight drew on, found hanging neighborhood little isolated jail, perhaps undefined hope something would happen might clear away difficulties. But nothing happened; seemed angels fairies interested luckless captive. The boys often done before—went cell grating gave Potter tobacco matches. He ground floor guards. His gratitude gifts always smote consciences before—it cut deeper ever, time. They felt cowardly treacherous last degree Potter said: “You mighty good me, boys—better’n anybody else town. And I forget it, I not. Often I says myself, says I, ‘I used mend boys’ kites things, show good fishin’ places was, befriend I could, forgot old Muff trouble; Tom not, Huck not—_they_ forget him, says I, ‘and I forget them.’ Well, boys, I done awful thing—drunk crazy time—that way I account it—and I got swing it, right. Right, _best_, too, I reckon—hope so, anyway. Well, talk that. I want make _you_ feel bad; befriended me. But I want say, is, _you_ ever get drunk—then ever get here. Stand litter furder west—so—that it; prime comfort see faces friendly body’s muck trouble, none come yourn. Good friendly faces—good friendly faces. Git one another’s backs let touch them. That it. Shake hands—yourn’ll come bars, mine’s big. Little hands, weak—but helped Muff Potter power, would help could.” Tom went home miserable, dreams night full horrors. The next day day after, hung courtroom, drawn almost irresistible impulse go in, forcing stay out. Huck experience. They studiously avoided other. Each wandered away, time time, dismal fascination always brought back presently. Tom kept ears open idlers sauntered courtroom, invariably heard distressing news—the toils closing relentlessly around poor Potter. At end second day village talk effect Injun Joe’s evidence stood firm unshaken, slightest question jury’s verdict would be. Tom late, night, came bed window. He tremendous state excitement. It hours got sleep. All village flocked courthouse next morning, great day. Both sexes equally represented packed audience. After long wait jury filed took places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale haggard, timid hopeless, brought in, chains upon him, seated curious eyes could stare him; less conspicuous Injun Joe, stolid ever. There another pause, judge arrived sheriff proclaimed opening court. The usual whisperings among lawyers gathering together papers followed. These details accompanying delays worked atmosphere preparation impressive fascinating. Now witness called testified found Muff Potter washing brook, early hour morning murder discovered, immediately sneaked away. After questioning, counsel prosecution said: “Take witness.” The prisoner raised eyes moment, dropped counsel said: “I questions ask him.” The next witness proved finding knife near corpse. Counsel prosecution said: “Take witness.” “I questions ask him,” Potter’s lawyer replied. A third witness swore often seen knife Potter’s possession. “Take witness.” Counsel Potter declined question him. The faces audience began betray annoyance. Did attorney mean throw away client’s life without effort? Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter’s guilty behavior brought scene murder. They allowed leave stand without cross-questioned. Every detail damaging circumstances occurred graveyard upon morning present remembered well brought credible witnesses, none cross-examined Potter’s lawyer. The perplexity dissatisfaction house expressed murmurs provoked reproof bench. Counsel prosecution said: “By oaths citizens whose simple word suspicion, fastened awful crime, beyond possibility question, upon unhappy prisoner bar. We rest case here.” A groan escaped poor Potter, put face hands rocked body softly fro, painful silence reigned courtroom. Many men moved, many women’s compassion testified tears. Counsel defence rose said: “Your honor, remarks opening trial, foreshadowed purpose prove client fearful deed influence blind irresponsible delirium produced drink. We changed mind. We shall offer plea.” [Then clerk:] “Call Thomas Sawyer!” A puzzled amazement awoke every face house, even excepting Potter’s. Every eye fastened wondering interest upon Tom rose took place upon stand. The boy looked wild enough, badly scared. The oath administered. “Thomas Sawyer, seventeenth June, hour midnight?” Tom glanced Injun Joe’s iron face tongue failed him. The audience listened breathless, words refused come. After moments, however, boy got little strength back, managed put enough voice make part house hear: “In graveyard!” “A little bit louder, please. Do afraid. You were—” “In graveyard.” A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe’s face. “Were anywhere near Horse Williams’ grave?” “Yes, sir.” “Speak up—just trifle louder. How near you?” “Near I you.” “Were hidden, not?” “I hid.” “Where?” “Behind elms edge grave.” Injun Joe gave barely perceptible start. “Any one you?” “Yes, sir. I went with—” “Wait—wait moment. Never mind mentioning companion’s name. We produce proper time. Did carry anything you.” Tom hesitated looked confused. “Speak out, boy—do diffident. The truth always respectable. What take there?” “Only a—a—dead cat.” There ripple mirth, court checked. “We produce skeleton cat. Now, boy, tell us everything occurred—tell way—do skip anything, afraid.” Tom began—hesitatingly first, warmed subject words flowed easily; little every sound ceased voice; every eye fixed upon him; parted lips bated breath audience hung upon words, taking note time, rapt ghastly fascinations tale. The strain upon pent emotion reached climax boy said: “—and doctor fetched board around Muff Potter fell, Injun Joe jumped knife and—” Crash! Quick lightning halfbreed sprang window, tore way opposers, gone! CHAPTER XXIV TOM glittering hero more—the pet old, envy young. His name even went immortal print, village paper magnified him. There believed would President, yet, escaped hanging. As usual, fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter bosom fondled lavishly abused before. But sort conduct world’s credit; therefore well find fault it. Tom’s days days splendor exultation him, nights seasons horror. Injun Joe infested dreams, always doom eye. Hardly temptation could persuade boy stir abroad nightfall. Poor Huck state wretchedness terror, Tom told whole story lawyer night great day trial, Huck sore afraid share business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding Injun Joe’s flight saved suffering testifying court. The poor fellow got attorney promise secrecy, that? Since Tom’s harassed conscience managed drive lawyer’s house night wring dread tale lips sealed dismalest formidable oaths, Huck’s confidence human race wellnigh obliterated. Daily Muff Potter’s gratitude made Tom glad spoken; nightly wished sealed tongue. Half time Tom afraid Injun Joe would never captured; half afraid would be. He felt sure never could draw safe breath man dead seen corpse. Rewards offered, country scoured, Injun Joe found. One omniscient aweinspiring marvels, detective, came St. Louis, moused around, shook head, looked wise, made sort astounding success members craft usually achieve. That say, “found clew.” But cannot hang “clew” murder, detective got gone home, Tom felt insecure before. The slow days drifted on, left behind slightly lightened weight apprehension. CHAPTER XXV THERE comes time every rightly-constructed boy’s life raging desire go somewhere dig hidden treasure. This desire suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied find Joe Harper, failed success. Next sought Ben Rogers; gone fishing. Presently stumbled upon Huck Finn Red-Handed. Huck would answer. Tom took private place opened matter confidentially. Huck willing. Huck always willing take hand enterprise offered entertainment required capital, troublesome superabundance sort time money. “Where’ll dig?” said Huck. “Oh, anywhere.” “Why, hid around?” “No, indeed not. It hid mighty particular places, Huck—sometimes islands, sometimes rotten chests end limb old dead tree, shadow falls midnight; mostly floor ha’nted houses.” “Who hides it?” “Why, robbers, course—who would reckon? Sunday-school sup’rintendents?” “I know. If mine I would hide it; I would spend good time.” “So would I. But robbers way. They always hide leave there.” “Do come more?” “No, think will, generally forget marks, else die. Anyway, lays long time gets rusty; somebody finds old yellow paper tells find marks—a paper got ciphered week mostly signs hy’roglyphics.” “Hyro—which?” “Hy’roglyphics—pictures things, know, seem mean anything.” “Have got one papers, Tom?” “No.” “Well then, going find marks?” “I want marks. They always bury ha’nted house island, dead tree got one limb sticking out. Well, tried Jackson’s Island little, try time; old ha’nted house Still-House branch, lots dead-limb trees—dead loads them.” “Is them?” “How talk! No!” “Then going know one go for?” “Go them!” “Why, Tom, take summer.” “Well, that? Suppose find brass pot hundred dollars it, rusty gray, rotten chest full di’monds. How that?” Huck’s eyes glowed. “That bully. Plenty bully enough me. Just give hundred dollars I want di’monds.” “All right. But I bet I going throw di’monds. Some them’s worth twenty dollars apiece—there any, hardly, but’s worth six bits dollar.” “No! Is so?” “Cert’nly—anybody’ll tell so. Hain’t ever seen one, Huck?” “Not I remember.” “Oh, kings slathers them.” “Well, I don’ know kings, Tom.” “I reckon not. But go Europe would see raft hopping around.” “Do hop?” “Hop?—your granny! No!” “Well, say did, for?” “Shucks, I meant would _see_ them—not hopping, course—what want hop for?—but I mean would see them—scattered around, know, kind general way. Like old humpbacked Richard.” “Richard? What name?” “He name. Kings given name.” “No?” “But not.” “Well, like it, Tom, right; I want king given name, like nigger. But say—where going dig first?” “Well, I know. S’pose tackle old dead-limb tree hill t’other side Still-House branch?” “I agreed.” So got crippled pick shovel, set three-mile tramp. They arrived hot panting, threw shade neighboring elm rest smoke. “I like this,” said Tom. “So I.” “Say, Huck, find treasure here, going share?” “Well, I pie glass soda every day, I go every circus comes along. I bet I gay time.” “Well, going save it?” “Save it? What for?” “Why, something live on, by.” “Oh, use. Pap would come back thish-yer town day get claws I hurry up, I tell would clean pretty quick. What going yourn, Tom?” “I going buy new drum, sure’nough sword, red necktie bull pup, get married.” “Married!” “That it.” “Tom, you—why, right mind.” “Wait—you see.” “Well, foolishest thing could do. Look pap mother. Fight! Why, used fight time. I remember, mighty well.” “That anything. The girl I going marry fight.” “Tom, I reckon alike. They comb body. Now better think ’bout awhile. I tell better. What name gal?” “It gal all—it girl.” “It same, I reckon; says gal, says girl—both’s right, like enough. Anyway, name, Tom?” “I tell time—not now.” “All right—that do. Only get married I lonesomer ever.” “No not. You come live me. Now stir go digging.” They worked sweated half hour. No result. They toiled another halfhour. Still result. Huck said: “Do always bury deep this?” “Sometimes—not always. Not generally. I reckon got right place.” So chose new spot began again. The labor dragged little, still made progress. They pegged away silence time. Finally Huck leaned shovel, swabbed beaded drops brow sleeve, said: “Where going dig next, get one?” “I reckon maybe tackle old tree yonder Cardiff Hill back widow’s.” “I reckon good one. But widow take away us, Tom? It land.” “_She_ take away! Maybe would like try once. Whoever finds one hid treasures, belongs him. It make difference whose land on.” That satisfactory. The work went on. By Huck said: “Blame it, must wrong place again. What think?” “It mighty curious, Huck. I understand it. Sometimes witches interfere. I reckon maybe trouble now.” “Shucks! Witches got power daytime.” “Well, so. I think that. Oh, I know matter is! What blamed lot fools are! You got find shadow limb falls midnight, dig!” “Then consound it, fooled away work nothing. Now hang all, got come back night. It awful long way. Can get out?” “I bet I will. We got tonight, too, somebody sees holes know minute go it.” “Well, I come around maow tonight.” “All right. Let us hide tools bushes.” The boys night, appointed time. They sat shadow waiting. It lonely place, hour made solemn old traditions. Spirits whispered rustling leaves, ghosts lurked murky nooks, deep baying hound floated distance, owl answered sepulchral note. The boys subdued solemnities, talked little. By judged twelve come; marked shadow fell, began dig. Their hopes commenced rise. Their interest grew stronger, industry kept pace it. The hole deepened still deepened, every time hearts jumped hear pick strike upon something, suffered new disappointment. It stone chunk. At last Tom said: “It use, Huck, wrong again.” “Well, _can’t_ wrong. We spotted shadder dot.” “I know it, another thing.” “What that?”. “Why, guessed time. Like enough late early.” Huck dropped shovel. “That it,” said he. “That trouble. We got give one up. We cannot ever tell right time, besides kind thing’s awful, time night witches ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel something behind time; I afeard turn around, becuz maybe others front a-waiting chance. I creeping over, ever since I got here.” “Well, I pretty much so, too, Huck. They always put dead man bury treasure tree, look it.” “Lordy!” “Yes, do. I always heard that.” “Tom, I like fool around much dead people. A body’s bound get trouble them, sure.” “I like stir up, either. S’pose one stick skull say something!” “Do Tom! It awful.” “Well, is. Huck, I feel comfortable bit.” “Say, Tom, let us give place up, try somewheres else.” “All right, I reckon better.” “What be?” Tom considered awhile; said: “The ha’nted house. That it!” “Blame it, I like ha’nted houses, Tom. Why, dern sight worse’n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, come sliding around shroud, noticing, peep shoulder sudden grit teeth, way ghost does. I could stand thing that, Tom—nobody could.” “Yes, but, Huck, ghosts travel around night. They hender us digging daytime.” “Well, so. But know mighty well people go ha’nted house day night.” “Well, mostly like go man’s murdered, anyway—but nothing’s ever seen around house except night—just blue lights slipping windows—no regular ghosts.” “Well, see one blue lights flickering around, Tom, bet ghost mighty close behind it. It stands reason. Becuz know anybody ghosts use them.” “Yes, so. But anyway come around daytime, use afeard?” “Well, right. We tackle ha’nted house say so—but I reckon taking chances.” They started hill time. There middle moonlit valley stood “ha’nted” house, utterly isolated, fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering doorsteps, chimney crumbled ruin, window-sashes vacant, corner roof caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting see blue light flit past window; talking low tone, befitted time circumstances, struck far right, give haunted house wide berth, took way homeward woods adorned rearward side Cardiff Hill. CHAPTER XXVI ABOUT noon next day boys arrived dead tree; come tools. Tom impatient go haunted house; Huck measurably so, also—but suddenly said: “Lookyhere, Tom, know day is?” Tom mentally ran days week, quickly lifted eyes startled look them— “My! I never thought it, Huck!” “Well, I neither, popped onto Friday.” “Blame it, body cannot careful, Huck. We might ’a’ got awful scrape, tackling thing Friday.” “_Might_! Better say _would_! There lucky days, maybe, Friday not.” “Any fool knows that. I reckon _you_ first found out, Huck.” “Well, I never said I was, I? And Friday all, neither. I rotten bad dream last night—dreampt rats.” “No! Sure sign trouble. Did fight?” “No.” “Well, good, Huck. When fight sign trouble around, know. All got look mighty sharp keep it. We drop thing today, play. Do know Robin Hood, Huck?” “No. Who Robin Hood?” “Why, one greatest men ever England—and best. He robber.” “Cracky, I wisht I was. Who rob?” “Only sheriffs bishops rich people kings, like. But never bothered poor. He loved them. He always divided perfectly square.” “Well, must ’a’ brick.” “I bet was, Huck. Oh, noblest man ever was. They men now, I tell you. He could lick man England, one hand tied behind him; could take yew bow plug ten-cent piece every time, mile half.” “What _yew_ bow?” “I know. It kind bow, course. And hit dime edge would set cry—and curse. But play Robin Hood—it nobby fun. I learn you.” “I agreed.” So played Robin Hood afternoon, casting yearning eye upon haunted house passing remark morrow’s prospects possibilities there. As sun began sink west took way homeward athwart long shadows trees soon buried sight forests Cardiff Hill. On Saturday, shortly noon, boys dead tree again. They smoke chat shade, dug little last hole, great hope, merely Tom said many cases people given treasure getting within six inches it, somebody else come along turned single thrust shovel. The thing failed time, however, boys shouldered tools went away feeling trifled fortune, fulfilled requirements belong business treasure-hunting. When reached haunted house something weird grisly dead silence reigned baking sun, something depressing loneliness desolation place, afraid, moment, venture in. Then crept door took trembling peep. They saw weedgrown, floorless room, unplastered, ancient fireplace, vacant windows, ruinous staircase; here, there, everywhere hung ragged abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, quickened pulses, talking whispers, ears alert catch slightest sound, muscles tense ready instant retreat. In little familiarity modified fears gave place critical interested examination, rather admiring boldness, wondering it, too. Next wanted look upstairs. This something like cutting retreat, got daring other, course could one result—they threw tools corner made ascent. Up signs decay. In one corner found closet promised mystery, promise fraud—there nothing it. Their courage well hand. They go begin work when— “Sh!” said Tom. “What it?” whispered Huck, blanching fright. “Sh!... There!... Hear it?” “Yes!... Oh, my! Let us run!” “Keep still! Do budge! They coming right toward door.” The boys stretched upon floor eyes knotholes planking, lay waiting, misery fear. “They stopped.... No—coming.... Here are. Do whisper another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I this!” Two men entered. Each boy said himself: “There old deaf dumb Spaniard town twice lately—never saw t’other man before.” “T’other” ragged, unkempt creature, nothing pleasant face. The Spaniard wrapped serape; bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed sombrero, wore green goggles. When came in, “t’other” talking low voice; sat ground, facing door, backs wall, speaker continued remarks. His manner became less guarded words distinct proceeded: “No,” said he, “I thought over, I like it. It dangerous.” “Dangerous!” grunted “deaf dumb” Spaniard—to vast surprise boys. “Milksop!” This voice made boys gasp quake. It Injun Joe’s! There silence time. Then Joe said: “What dangerous job yonder—but nothing’s come it.” “That different. Away river so, another house about. ’Twon’t ever known tried, anyway, long succeed.” “Well, dangerous coming daytime!—anybody would suspicion us saw us.” “I know that. But warn’t place handy fool job. I want quit shanty. I wanted yesterday, warn’t use trying stir here, infernal boys playing hill right full view.” “Those infernal boys” quaked inspiration remark, thought lucky remembered Friday concluded wait day. They wished hearts waited year. The two men got food made luncheon. After long thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said: “Look here, lad—you go back river belong. Wait till hear me. I take chances dropping town more, look. We ‘dangerous’ job I spied around little think things look well it. Then Texas! We leg together!” This satisfactory. Both men presently fell yawning, Injun Joe said: “I dead sleep! It turn watch.” He curled weeds soon began snore. His comrade stirred twice became quiet. Presently watcher began nod; head drooped lower lower, men began snore now. The boys drew long, grateful breath. Tom whispered: “Now’s chance—come!” Huck said: “I cannot—I would die wake.” Tom urged—Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly softly, started alone. But first step made wrung hideous creak crazy floor sank almost dead fright. He never made second attempt. The boys lay counting dragging moments till seemed time must done eternity growing gray; grateful note last sun setting. Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around—smiled grimly upon comrade, whose head drooping upon knees—stirred foot said: “Here! _You’re_ watchman, you! All right, though—nothing’s happened.” “My! I asleep?” “Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time us moving, pard. What little swag got left?” “I know—leave always done, I reckon. No use take away till start south. Six hundred fifty silver’s something carry.” “Well—all right—it matter come more.” “No—but I would say come night used do—it better.” “Yes: look here; may good I get right chance job; accidents might happen; ’tain’t good place; regularly bury it—and bury deep.” “Good idea,” said comrade, walked across room, knelt down, raised one rearward hearth-stones took bag jingled pleasantly. He subtracted twenty thirty dollars much Injun Joe, passed bag latter, knees corner, now, digging bowie-knife. The boys forgot fears, miseries instant. With gloating eyes watched every movement. Luck!—the splendor beyond imagination! Six hundred dollars money enough make half dozen boys rich! Here treasure-hunting happiest auspices—there would bothersome uncertainty dig. They nudged every moment—eloquent nudges easily understood, simply meant—“Oh, glad _now_ here!” Joe’s knife struck upon something. “Hello!” said he. “What it?” said comrade. “Half-rotten plank—no, box, I believe. Here—bear hand see for. Never mind, I broke hole.” He reached hand drew out— “Man, money!” The two men examined handful coins. They gold. The boys excited themselves, delighted. Joe’s comrade said: “We make quick work this. There old rusty pick amongst weeds corner side fireplace—I saw minute ago.” He ran brought boys’ pick shovel. Injun Joe took pick, looked critically, shook head, muttered something himself, began use it. The box soon unearthed. It large; iron bound strong slow years injured it. The men contemplated treasure awhile blissful silence. “Pard, thousands dollars here,” said Injun Joe. “It Was always said Murrel’s gang used around one summer,” stranger observed. “I know it,” said Injun Joe; “and looks like it, I say.” “Now need job.” The halfbreed frowned. Said he: “You know me. Least know thing. ’Tain’t robbery altogether—it _revenge_!” wicked light flamed eyes. “I need help it. When finished—then Texas. Go home Nance kids, stand till hear me.” “Well—if say so; this—bury again?” “Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] _No_! great Sachem, no! [Profound distress overhead.] I would nearly forgot. That pick fresh earth it! [The boys sick terror moment.] What business pick shovel here? What business fresh earth them? Who brought here—and gone? Have heard anybody?—seen anybody? What! bury leave come see ground disturbed? Not exactly—not exactly. We take den.” “Why, course! Might thought before. You mean Number One?” “No—Number Two—under cross. The place bad—too common.” “All right. It nearly dark enough start.” Injun Joe got went window window cautiously peeping out. Presently said: “Who could brought tools here? Do reckon upstairs?” The boys’ breath forsook them. Injun Joe put hand knife, halted moment, undecided, turned toward stairway. The boys thought closet, strength gone. The steps came creaking stairs—the intolerable distress situation woke stricken resolution lads—they spring closet, crash rotten timbers Injun Joe landed ground amid debris ruined stairway. He gathered cursing, comrade said: “Now use that? If anybody, there, let _stay_ there—who cares? If want jump down, now, get trouble, objects? It dark fifteen minutes—and let follow us want to. I willing. In opinion, whoever hove things caught sight us took us ghosts devils something. I bet running yet.” Joe grumbled awhile; agreed friend daylight left ought economized getting things ready leaving. Shortly afterward slipped house deepening twilight, moved toward river precious box. Tom Huck rose up, weak vastly relieved, stared chinks logs house. Follow? Not they. They content reach ground without broken necks, take townward track hill. They talk much. They much absorbed hating themselves—hating ill luck made take spade pick there. But that, Injun Joe never would suspected. He would hidden silver gold wait till “revenge” satisfied, would misfortune find money turn missing. Bitter, bitter luck tools ever brought there! They resolved keep lookout Spaniard come town spying chances revengeful job, follow “Number Two,” wherever might be. Then ghastly thought occurred Tom. “Revenge? What means _us_, Huck!” “Oh, not!” said Huck, nearly fainting. They talked over, entered town agreed believe might possibly mean somebody else—at least might least mean nobody Tom, since Tom testified. Very, small comfort Tom alone danger! Company would palpable improvement, thought. CHAPTER XXVII THE adventure day mightily tormented Tom’s dreams night. Four times hands rich treasure four times wasted nothingness fingers sleep forsook wakefulness brought back hard reality misfortune. As lay early morning recalling incidents great adventure, noticed seemed curiously subdued far away—somewhat happened another world, time long gone by. Then occurred great adventure must dream! There one strong argument favor idea—namely, quantity coin seen vast real. He never seen much fifty dollars one mass before, like boys age station life, imagined references “hundreds” “thousands” mere fanciful forms speech, sums really existed world. He never supposed moment large sum hundred dollars found actual money one’s possession. If notions hidden treasure analyzed, would found consist handful real dimes bushel vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars. But incidents adventure grew sensibly sharper clearer attrition thinking over, presently found leaning impression thing might dream, all. This uncertainty must swept away. He would snatch hurried breakfast go find Huck. Huck sitting gunwale flatboat, listlessly dangling feet water looking melancholy. Tom concluded let Huck lead subject. If it, adventure would proved dream. “Hello, Huck!” “Hello, yourself.” Silence, minute. “Tom, would ’a’ left blame tools dead tree, would ’a’ got money. Oh, awful!” “’Tain’t dream, then, ’tain’t dream! Somehow I wish was. Dog’d I not, Huck.” “What dream?” “Oh, thing yesterday. I half thinking was.” “Dream! If stairs broke would ’a’ seen much dream was! I dreams enough night—with patch-eyed Spanish devil going them—rot him!” “No, rot him. _Find_ him! Track money!” “Tom, never find him. A feller one chance pile—and one’s lost. I would feel mighty shaky I see him, anyway.” “Well, so’d I; I would like see him, anyway—and track out—to Number Two.” “Number Two—yes, it. I thinking ’bout that. But I cannot make nothing it. What reckon is?” “I dono. It deep. Say, Huck—maybe number house!” “Goody!... No, Tom, it. If is, one-horse town. They numbers here.” “Well, so. Let Me think minute. Here—it number room—in tavern, know!” “Oh, trick! They two taverns. We find quick.” “You stay here, Huck, till I come.” Tom once. He care Huck’s company public places. He gone half hour. He found best tavern, No. 2 long occupied young lawyer, still occupied. In less ostentatious house, No. 2 mystery. The tavern-keeper’s young son said kept locked time, never saw anybody go come except night; know particular reason state things; little curiosity, rather feeble; made mystery entertaining idea room “ha’nted”; noticed light night before. “That I found out, Huck. I reckon No. 2 after.” “I reckon is, Tom. Now going do?” “Let Me think.” Tom thought long time. Then said: “I tell you. The back door No. 2 door comes little close alley tavern old rattle trap brick store. Now get hold doorkeys find, I nip auntie’s, first dark night go try them. And mind you, keep lookout Injun Joe, said going drop town spy around chance get revenge. If see him, follow him; go No. 2, place.” “Lordy, I want foller myself!” “Why, night, sure. He might ever see you—and did, maybe would never think anything.” “Well, pretty dark I reckon I track him. I dono—I dono. I try.” “You bet I follow him, dark, Huck. Why, might ’a’ found could get revenge, going right money.” “It so, Tom, so. I foller him; I will, jingoes!” “Now _talking_! Do ever weaken, Huck, I not.” CHAPTER XXVIII THAT night Tom Huck ready adventure. They hung neighborhood tavern nine, one watching alley distance tavern door. Nobody entered alley left it; nobody resembling Spaniard entered left tavern door. The night promised fair one; Tom went home understanding considerable degree darkness came on, Huck come “maow,” whereupon would slip try keys. But night remained clear, Huck closed watch retired bed empty sugar hogshead twelve. Tuesday boys ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday night promised better. Tom slipped good season aunt’s old tin lantern, large towel blindfold with. He hid lantern Huck’s sugar hogshead watch began. An hour midnight tavern closed lights (the ones thereabouts) put out. No Spaniard seen. Nobody entered left alley. Everything auspicious. The blackness darkness reigned, perfect stillness interrupted occasional mutterings distant thunder. Tom got lantern, lit hogshead, wrapped closely towel, two adventurers crept gloom toward tavern. Huck stood sentry Tom felt way alley. Then season waiting anxiety weighed upon Huck’s spirits like mountain. He began wish could see flash lantern—it would frighten him, would least tell Tom alive yet. It seemed hours since Tom disappeared. Surely must fainted; maybe dead; maybe heart burst terror excitement. In uneasiness Huck found drawing closer closer alley; fearing sorts dreadful things, momentarily expecting catastrophe happen would take away breath. There much take away, seemed able inhale thimblefuls, heart would soon wear out, way beating. Suddenly flash light Tom came tearing him: “Run!” said he; “run, life!” He need repeated it; enough; Huck making thirty forty miles hour repetition uttered. The boys never stopped till reached would deserted slaughter-house lower end village. Just got within shelter storm burst rain poured down. As soon Tom got breath said: “Huck, awful! I tried two keys, soft I could; seemed make power racket I could hardly get breath I scared. They would turn lock, either. Well, without noticing I doing, I took hold knob, open comes door! It warn’t locked! I hopped in, shook towel, and, _Great Caesar’s Ghost!_” “What!—what see, Tom?” “Huck, I stepped onto Injun Joe’s hand!” “No!” “Yes! He lying there, sound asleep floor, old patch eye arms spread out.” “Lordy, do? Did wake up?” “No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I grabbed towel started!” “I would never ’a’ thought towel, I bet!” “Well, I would. My aunt would make mighty sick I lost it.” “Say, Tom, see box?” “Huck, I wait look around. I see box, I see cross. I see anything bottle tin cup floor Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels lots bottles room. Do see, now, matter ha’nted room?” “How?” “Why, ha’nted whiskey! Maybe _all_ Temperance Taverns got ha’nted room, hey, Huck?” “Well, I reckon maybe so. Who would ’a’ thought thing? But say, Tom, now’s mighty good time get box, Injun Joe’s drunk.” “It is, that! You try it!” Huck shuddered. “Well, no—I reckon not.” “And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside Injun Joe enough. If would three, would drunk enough I would it.” There long pause reflection, Tom said: “Lookyhere, Huck, less try thing till know Injun Joe’s there. It scary. Now, watch every night, dead sure see go out, time other, snatch box quicker’n lightning.” “Well, I agreed. I watch whole night long, I every night, too, part job.” “All right, I will. All got trot Hooper Street block maow—and I asleep, throw gravel window fetch me.” “Agreed, good wheat!” “Now, Huck, storm’s over, I go home. It begin daylight couple hours. You go back watch long, you?” “I said I would, Tom, I will. I ha’nt tavern every night year! I sleep day I stand watch night.” “That right. Now, going sleep?” “In Ben Rogers’ hayloft. He let us me, pap’s nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water Uncle Jake whenever wants to, time I ask gives little something eat spare it. That mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I ever act I him. Sometime I set right eat _with_ him. But need tell that. A body’s got things awful hungry would want steady thing.” “Well, I want daytime, I let sleep. I come bothering around. Any time see something up, night, skip right around maow.” CHAPTER XXIX THE first thing Tom heard Friday morning glad piece news—Judge Thatcher’s family come back town night before. Both Injun Joe treasure sunk secondary importance moment, Becky took chief place boy’s interest. He saw exhausting good time playing “hispy” “gully-keeper” crowd schoolmates. The day completed crowned peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased mother appoint next day long-promised long-delayed picnic, consented. The child’s delight boundless; Tom’s moderate. The invitations sent sunset, straightway young folks village thrown fever preparation pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled keep awake pretty late hour, good hopes hearing Huck’s “maow,” treasure astonish Becky picnickers with, next day; disappointed. No signal came night. Morning came, eventually, ten eleven clock giddy rollicking company gathered Judge Thatcher’s, everything ready start. It custom elderly people mar picnics presence. The children considered safe enough wings young ladies eighteen young gentlemen twenty-three thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat chartered occasion; presently gay throng filed main street laden provision-baskets. Sid sick miss fun; Mary remained home entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said Becky, was: “You get back till late. Perhaps would better stay night girls live near ferry-landing, child.” “Then I stay Susy Harper, mamma.” “Very well. And mind behave trouble.” Presently, tripped along, Tom said Becky: “Say—I tell do. ’Stead going Joe Harper’s climb right hill stop Widow Douglas’. She ice-cream! She every day—dead loads it. And awful glad us.” “Oh, fun!” Then Becky reflected moment said: “But mamma say?” “How ever know?” The girl turned idea mind, said reluctantly: “I reckon wrong—but—” “But shucks! Your mother know, harm? All wants safe; I bet would ’a’ said go would ’a’ thought it. I know would!” The Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality tempting bait. It Tom’s persuasions presently carried day. So decided say nothing anybody night’s programme. Presently occurred Tom maybe Huck might come night give signal. The thought took deal spirit anticipations. Still could bear give fun Widow Douglas’. And give up, reasoned—the signal come night before, likely come tonight? The sure fun evening outweighed uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, determined yield stronger inclination allow think box money another time day. Three miles town ferryboat stopped mouth woody hollow tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore soon forest distances craggy heights echoed far near shoutings laughter. All different ways getting hot tired gone with, by-and-by rovers straggled back camp fortified responsible appetites, destruction good things began. After feast refreshing season rest chat shade spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted: “Who ready cave?” Everybody was. Bundles candles procured, straightway general scamper hill. The mouth cave hillside—an opening shaped like letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within small chamber, chilly icehouse, walled Nature solid limestone dewy cold sweat. It romantic mysterious stand deep gloom look upon green valley shining sun. But impressiveness situation quickly wore off, romping began again. The moment candle lighted general rush upon owner it; struggle gallant defence followed, candle soon knocked blown out, glad clamor laughter new chase. But things end. By-and-by procession went filing steep descent main avenue, flickering rank lights dimly revealing lofty walls rock almost point junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue eight ten feet wide. Every steps lofty still narrower crevices branched either hand—for McDougal’s cave vast labyrinth crooked aisles ran led nowhere. It said one might wander days nights together intricate tangle rifts chasms, never find end cave; might go down, down, still down, earth, same—labyrinth labyrinth, end them. No man “knew” cave. That impossible thing. Most young men knew portion it, customary venture much beyond known portion. Tom Sawyer knew much cave one. The procession moved along main avenue three-quarters mile, groups couples began slip aside branch avenues, fly along dismal corridors, take surprise points corridors joined again. Parties able elude space half hour without going beyond “known” ground. By-and-by, one group another came straggling back mouth cave, panting, hilarious, smeared head foot tallow drippings, daubed clay, entirely delighted success day. Then astonished find taking note time night hand. The clanging bell calling half hour. However, sort close day’s adventures romantic therefore satisfactory. When ferryboat wild freight pushed stream, nobody cared sixpence wasted time captain craft. Huck already upon watch ferryboat’s lights went glinting past wharf. He heard noise board, young people subdued still people usually nearly tired death. He wondered boat was, stop wharf—and dropped mind put attention upon business. The night growing cloudy dark. Ten clock came, noise vehicles ceased, scattered lights began wink out, straggling foot-passengers disappeared, village betook slumbers left small watcher alone silence ghosts. Eleven clock came, tavern lights put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited seemed weary long time, nothing happened. His faith weakening. Was use? Was really use? Why give turn in? A noise fell upon ear. He attention instant. The alley door closed softly. He sprang corner brick store. The next moment two men brushed him, one seemed something arm. It must box! So going remove treasure. Why call Tom now? It would absurd—the men would get away box never found again. No, would stick wake follow them; would trust darkness security discovery. So communing himself, Huck stepped glided along behind men, cat-like, bare feet, allowing keep far enough ahead invisible. They moved river street three blocks, turned left crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, came path led Cardiff Hill; took. They passed old Welshman’s house, halfway hill, without hesitating, still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, bury old quarry. But never stopped quarry. They passed on, summit. They plunged narrow path tall sumach bushes, hidden gloom. Huck closed shortened distance, now, would never able see him. He trotted along awhile; slackened pace, fearing gaining fast; moved piece, stopped altogether; listened; sound; none, save seemed hear beating heart. The hooting owl came hill—ominous sound! But footsteps. Heavens, everything lost! He spring winged feet, man cleared throat four feet him! Huck’s heart shot throat, swallowed again; stood shaking dozen agues taken charge once, weak thought must surely fall ground. He knew was. He knew within five steps stile leading Widow Douglas’ grounds. Very well, thought, let bury there; hard find. Now voice—a low voice—Injun Joe’s: “Damn her, maybe got company—there lights, late is.” “I cannot see any.” This stranger’s voice—the stranger haunted house. A deadly chill went Huck’s heart—this, then, “revenge” job! His thought was, fly. Then remembered Widow Douglas kind once, maybe men going murder her. He wished dared venture warn her; knew dare—they might come catch him. He thought moment elapsed stranger’s remark Injun Joe’s next—which was— “Because bush way. Now—this way—now see, you?” “Yes. Well, _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give up.” “Give up, I leaving country forever! Give maybe never another chance. I tell again, I told before, I care swag—you may it. But husband rough me—many times rough me—and mainly justice peace jugged vagrant. And all. It millionth part it! He _horsewhipped_!—horsewhipped front jail, like nigger!—with town looking on! _Horsewhipped_!—do understand? He took advantage died. But I take _her_.” “Oh, kill her! Do that!” “Kill? Who said anything killing? I would kill _him_ here; her. When want get revenge woman kill her—bosh! go looks. You slit nostrils—you notch ears like sow!” “By God, is—” “Keep opinion yourself! It safest you. I tie bed. If bleeds death, fault? I cry, does. My friend, help thing—for _my_ sake—that here—I might able alone. If flinch, I kill you. Do understand that? And I kill you, I kill her—and I reckon nobody’ll ever know much done business.” “Well, got done, let us get it. The quicker better—I shiver.” “Do _now_? And company there? Look here—I get suspicious you, first thing know. No—we wait till lights out—there hurry.” Huck felt silence going ensue—a thing still awful amount murderous talk; held breath stepped gingerly back; planted foot carefully firmly, balancing, one-legged, precarious way almost toppling over, first one side other. He took another step back, elaboration risks; another another, and—a twig snapped foot! His breath stopped listened. There sound—the stillness perfect. His gratitude measureless. Now turned tracks, walls sumach bushes—turned carefully ship—and stepped quickly cautiously along. When emerged quarry felt secure, picked nimble heels flew. Down, sped, till reached Welshman’s. He banged door, presently heads old man two stalwart sons thrust windows. “What row there? Who banging? What want?” “Let in—quick! I tell everything.” “Why, you?” “Huckleberry Finn—quick, let in!” “Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It name open many doors, I judge! But let in, lads, let us see trouble.” “Please ever tell I told you,” Huck’s first words got in. “Please not—I would killed, sure—but widow’s good friends sometimes, I want tell—I _will_ tell promise ever say me.” “By George, _has_ got something tell, would act so!” exclaimed old man; “out nobody here’ll ever tell, lad.” Three minutes later old man sons, well armed, hill, entering sumach path tiptoe, weapons hands. Huck accompanied further. He hid behind great bowlder fell listening. There lagging, anxious silence, sudden explosion firearms cry. Huck waited particulars. He sprang away sped hill fast legs could carry him. CHAPTER XXX AS earliest suspicion dawn appeared Sunday morning, Huck came groping hill rapped gently old Welshman’s door. The inmates asleep, sleep set hair-trigger, account exciting episode night. A call came window: “Who there!” Huck’s scared voice answered low tone: “Please let in! It Huck Finn!” “It name open door night day, lad!—and welcome!” These strange words vagabond boy’s ears, pleasantest ever heard. He could recollect closing word ever applied case before. The door quickly unlocked, entered. Huck given seat old man brace tall sons speedily dressed themselves. “Now, boy, I hope good hungry, breakfast ready soon sun’s up, piping hot one, too—make easy that! I boys hoped would turn stop last night.” “I awful scared,” said Huck, “and I run. I took pistols went off, I stop three mile. I come becuz I wanted know it, know; I come daylight becuz I want run across devils, even dead.” “Well, poor chap, look would hard night it—but bed breakfast. No, dead, lad—we sorry enough that. You see knew right put hands them, description; crept along tiptoe till got within fifteen feet them—dark cellar sumach path was—and I found I going sneeze. It meanest kind luck! I tried keep back, use—it bound come, come! I lead pistol raised, sneeze started scoundrels a-rustling get path, I sung out, ‘Fire boys!’ blazed away place rustling was. So boys. But jiffy, villains, them, woods. I judge never touched them. They fired shot apiece started, bullets whizzed us harm. As soon lost sound feet quit chasing, went stirred constables. They got posse together, went guard river bank, soon light sheriff gang going beat woods. My boys presently. I wish sort description rascals—’twould help good deal. But could see like, dark, lad, I suppose?” “Oh yes; I saw downtown follered them.” “Splendid! Describe them—describe them, boy!” “One’s old deaf dumb Spaniard ben around twice, t’other’s mean-looking, ragged—” “That enough, lad, know men! Happened woods back widow’s one day, slunk away. Off you, boys, tell sheriff—get breakfast tomorrow morning!” The Welshman’s sons departed once. As leaving room Huck sprang exclaimed: “Oh, please tell _any_body blowed them! Oh, please!” “All right say it, Huck, ought credit did.” “Oh no, no! Please tell!” When young men gone, old Welshman said: “They tell—and I not. But want known?” Huck would explain, say already knew much one men would man know knew anything whole world—he would killed knowing it, sure. The old man promised secrecy more, said: “How come follow fellows, lad? Were looking suspicious?” Huck silent framed duly cautious reply. Then said: “Well, see, I kind hard lot,—least everybody says so, I see nothing agin it—and sometimes I cannot sleep much, account thinking sort trying strike new way doing. That way last night. I could sleep, I come along upstreet ’bout midnight, a-turning over, I got old shackly brick store Temperance Tavern, I backed agin wall another think. Well, along comes two chaps slipping along close me, something arm, I reckoned would stole it. One a-smoking, t’other one wanted light; stopped right cigars lit faces I see big one deaf dumb Spaniard, white whiskers patch eye, t’other one rusty, ragged-looking devil.” “Could see rags light cigars?” This staggered Huck moment. Then said: “Well, I know—but somehow seems I did.” “Then went on, you—” “Follered them—yes. That it. I wanted see up—they sneaked along so. I dogged widder’s stile, stood dark heard ragged one beg widder, Spaniard swear would spile looks I told two—” “What! The _deaf dumb_ man said that!” Huck made another terrible mistake! He trying best keep old man getting faintest hint Spaniard might be, yet tongue seemed determined get trouble spite could do. He made several efforts creep scrape, old man’s eye upon made blunder blunder. Presently Welshman said: “My boy, afraid me. I would hurt hair head world. No—I would protect you—I would protect you. This Spaniard deaf dumb; let slip without intending it; cannot cover now. You know something Spaniard want keep dark. Now trust me—tell is, trust me—I betray you.” Huck looked old man’s honest eyes moment, bent whispered ear: “’Tain’t Spaniard—it Injun Joe!” The Welshman almost jumped chair. In moment said: “It plain enough, now. When talked notching ears slitting noses I judged embellishment, white men take sort revenge. But Injun! That different matter altogether.” During breakfast talk went on, course old man said last thing sons done, going bed, get lantern examine stile vicinity marks blood. They found none, captured bulky bundle of— “Of _what_?” If words lightning could leaped stunning suddenness Huck’s blanched lips. His eyes staring wide, now, breath suspended—waiting answer. The Welshman started—stared return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied: “Of burglar’s tools. Why, _matter_ you?” Huck sank back, panting gently, deeply, unutterably grateful. The Welshman eyed gravely, curiously—and presently said: “Yes, burglar’s tools. That appears relieve good deal. But give turn? What _you_ expecting would found?” Huck close place—the inquiring eye upon him—he would given anything material plausible answer—nothing suggested itself—the inquiring eye boring deeper deeper—a senseless reply offered—there time weigh it, venture uttered it—feebly: “Sunday-school books, maybe.” Poor Huck distressed smile, old man laughed loud joyously, shook details anatomy head foot, ended saying laugh money a-man’s pocket, cut doctor’s bill like everything. Then added: “Poor old chap, white jaded—you well bit—no wonder little flighty balance. But come it. Rest sleep fetch right, I hope.” Huck irritated think goose betrayed suspicious excitement, dropped idea parcel brought tavern treasure, soon heard talk widow’s stile. He thought treasure, however—he known not—and suggestion captured bundle much self-possession. But whole felt glad little episode happened, knew beyond question bundle _the_ bundle, mind rest exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed drifting right direction, now; treasure must still No. 2, men would captured jailed day, Tom could seize gold night without trouble fear interruption. Just breakfast completed knock door. Huck jumped hiding-place, mind connected even remotely late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies gentlemen, among Widow Douglas, noticed groups citizens climbing hill—to stare stile. So news spread. The Welshman tell story night visitors. The widow’s gratitude preservation outspoken. “Do say word it, madam. There another beholden boys, maybe, allow tell name. We would him.” Of course excited curiosity vast almost belittled main matter—but Welshman allowed eat vitals visitors, transmitted whole town, refused part secret. When else learned, widow said: “I went sleep reading bed slept straight noise. Why come wake me?” “We judged warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely come again—they tools left work with, use waking scaring death? My three negro men stood guard house rest night. They come back.” More visitors came, story told retold couple hours more. There Sabbath-school day-school vacation, everybody early church. The stirring event well canvassed. News came sign two villains yet discovered. When sermon finished, Judge Thatcher’s wife dropped alongside Mrs. Harper moved aisle crowd said: “Is Becky going sleep day? I expected would tired death.” “Your Becky?” “Yes,” startled look—“did stay last night?” “Why, no.” Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, sank pew, Aunt Polly, talking briskly friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said: “Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I got boy turned missing. I reckon Tom stayed house last night—one you. And afraid come church. I got settle him.” Mrs. Thatcher shook head feebly turned paler ever. “He stay us,” said Mrs. Harper, beginning look uneasy. A marked anxiety came Aunt Polly’s face. “Joe Harper, seen Tom morning?” “No’m.” “When see last?” Joe tried remember, sure could say. The people stopped moving church. Whispers passed along, boding uneasiness took possession every countenance. Children anxiously questioned, young teachers. They said noticed whether Tom Becky board ferryboat homeward trip; dark; one thought inquiring one missing. One young man finally blurted fear still cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell crying wringing hands. The alarm swept lip lip, group group, street street, within five minutes bells wildly clanging whole town up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank instant insignificance, burglars forgotten, horses saddled, skiffs manned, ferryboat ordered out, horror half hour old, two hundred men pouring highroad river toward cave. All long afternoon village seemed empty dead. Many women visited Aunt Polly Mrs. Thatcher tried comfort them. They cried them, too, still better words. All tedious night town waited news; morning dawned last, word came was, “Send candles—and send food.” Mrs. Thatcher almost crazed; Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages hope encouragement cave, conveyed real cheer. The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered candle-grease, smeared clay, almost worn out. He found Huck still bed provided him, delirious fever. The physicians cave, Widow Douglas came took charge patient. She said would best him, because, whether good, bad, indifferent, Lord’s, nothing Lord’s thing neglected. The Welshman said Huck good spots him, widow said: “You depend it. That Lord’s mark. He leave off. He never does. Puts somewhere every creature comes hands.” Early forenoon parties jaded men began straggle village, strongest citizens continued searching. All news could gained remotenesses cavern ransacked never visited before; every corner crevice going thoroughly searched; wherever one wandered maze passages, lights seen flitting hither thither distance, shoutings pistol-shots sent hollow reverberations ear sombre aisles. In one place, far section usually traversed tourists, names “BECKY & TOM” found traced upon rocky wall candle-smoke, near hand grease-soiled bit ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized ribbon cried it. She said last relic ever child; memorial could ever precious, one parted latest living body awful death came. Some said then, cave, far-away speck light would glimmer, glorious shout would burst forth score men go trooping echoing aisle—and sickening disappointment always followed; children there; searcher’s light. Three dreadful days nights dragged tedious hours along, village sank hopeless stupor. No one heart anything. The accidental discovery, made, proprietor Temperance Tavern kept liquor premises, scarcely fluttered public pulse, tremendous fact was. In lucid interval, Huck feebly led subject taverns, finally asked—dimly dreading worst—if anything discovered Temperance Tavern since ill. “Yes,” said widow. Huck started bed, wildeyed: “What? What it?” “Liquor!—and place shut up. Lie down, child—what turn give me!” “Only tell one thing—only one—please! Was Tom Sawyer found it?” The widow burst tears. “Hush, hush, child, hush! I told before, must _not_ talk. You very, sick!” Then nothing liquor found; would great powwow gold. So treasure gone forever—gone forever! But could crying about? Curious cry. These thoughts worked dim way Huck’s mind, weariness gave fell asleep. The widow said herself: “There—he asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, many left, now, got hope enough, strength enough, either, go searching.” CHAPTER XXXI NOW return Tom Becky’s share picnic. They tripped along murky aisles rest company, visiting familiar wonders cave—wonders dubbed rather over-descriptive names, “The Drawing-Room,” “The Cathedral,” “Aladdin’s Palace,” on. Presently hide-and-seek frolicking began, Tom Becky engaged zeal exertion began grow trifle wearisome; wandered sinuous avenue holding candles aloft reading tangled webwork names, dates, postoffice addresses, mottoes rocky walls frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along talking, scarcely noticed part cave whose walls frescoed. They smoked names overhanging shelf moved on. Presently came place little stream water, trickling ledge carrying limestone sediment it, had, slow-dragging ages, formed laced ruffled Niagara gleaming imperishable stone. Tom squeezed small body behind order illuminate Becky’s gratification. He found curtained sort steep natural stairway enclosed narrow walls, ambition discoverer seized him. Becky responded call, made smoke-mark future guidance, started upon quest. They wound way that, far secret depths cave, made another mark, branched search novelties tell upper world about. In one place found spacious cavern, whose ceiling depended multitude shining stalactites length circumference man’s leg; walked it, wondering admiring, presently left one numerous passages opened it. This shortly brought bewitching spring, whose basin incrusted frostwork glittering crystals; midst cavern whose walls supported many fantastic pillars formed joining great stalactites stalagmites together, result ceaseless water-drip centuries. Under roof vast knots bats packed together, thousands bunch; lights disturbed creatures came flocking hundreds, squeaking darting furiously candles. Tom knew ways danger sort conduct. He seized Becky’s hand hurried first corridor offered; none soon, bat struck Becky’s light wing passing cavern. The bats chased children good distance; fugitives plunged every new passage offered, last got rid perilous things. Tom found subterranean lake, shortly, stretched dim length away shape lost shadows. He wanted explore borders, concluded would best sit rest awhile, first. Now, first time, deep stillness place laid clammy hand upon spirits children. Becky said: “Why, I notice, seems ever long since I heard others.” “Come think, Becky, away them—and I know far away north, south, east, whichever is. We could hear here.” Becky grew apprehensive. “I wonder long here, Tom? We better start back.” “Yes, I reckon better. P’raps better.” “Can find way, Tom? It mixed-up crookedness me.” “I reckon I could find it—but bats. If put candles awful fix. Let us try way, go there.” “Well. But I hope get lost. It would awful!” girl shuddered thought dreadful possibilities. They started corridor, traversed silence long way, glancing new opening, see anything familiar look it; strange. Every time Tom made examination, Becky would watch face encouraging sign, would say cheerily: “Oh, right. This one, come right away!” But felt less less hopeful failure, presently began turn diverging avenues sheer random, desperate hope finding one wanted. He still said “all right,” leaden dread heart words lost ring sounded said, “All lost!” Becky clung side anguish fear, tried hard keep back tears, would come. At last said: “Oh, Tom, never mind bats, let us go back way! We seem get worse worse time.” “Listen!” said he. Profound silence; silence deep even breathings conspicuous hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing empty aisles died distance faint sound resembled ripple mocking laughter. “Oh, again, Tom, horrid,” said Becky. “It horrid, I better, Becky; might hear us, know,” shouted again. The “might” even chillier horror ghostly laughter, confessed perishing hope. The children stood still listened; result. Tom turned upon back track once, hurried steps. It little certain indecision manner revealed another fearful fact Becky—he could find way back! “Oh, Tom, make marks!” “Becky, I fool! Such fool! I never thought might want come back! No—I cannot find way. It mixed up.” “Tom, Tom, lost! lost! We never get awful place! Oh, _did_ ever leave others!” She sank ground burst frenzy crying Tom appalled idea might die, lose reason. He sat put arms around her; buried face bosom, clung him, poured terrors, unavailing regrets, far echoes turned jeering laughter. Tom begged pluck hope again, said could not. He fell blaming abusing getting miserable situation; better effect. She said would try hope again, would get follow wherever might lead would talk like more. For blame she, said. So moved again—aimlessly—simply random—all could move, keep moving. For little while, hope made show reviving—not reason back it, nature revive spring taken age familiarity failure. By-and-by Tom took Becky’s candle blew out. This economy meant much! Words needed. Becky understood, hope died again. She knew Tom whole candle three four pieces pockets—yet must economize. By-and-by, fatigue began assert claims; children tried pay attention, dreadful think sitting time grown precious, moving, direction, direction, least progress might bear fruit; sit invite death shorten pursuit. At last Becky’s frail limbs refused carry farther. She sat down. Tom rested her, talked home, friends there, comfortable beds and, all, light! Becky cried, Tom tried think way comforting her, encouragements grown thread-bare use, sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore heavily upon Becky drowsed sleep. Tom grateful. He sat looking drawn face saw grow smooth natural influence pleasant dreams; by-and-by smile dawned rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat peace healing spirit, thoughts wandered away bygone times dreamy memories. While deep musings, Becky woke breezy little laugh—but stricken dead upon lips, groan followed it. “Oh, _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never waked! No! No, I not, Tom! Do look so! I say again.” “I glad slept, Becky; feel rested, now, find way out.” “We try, Tom; I seen beautiful country dream. I reckon going there.” “Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, let us go trying.” They rose wandered along, hand hand hopeless. They tried estimate long cave, knew seemed days weeks, yet plain could be, candles gone yet. A long time this—they could tell long—Tom said must go softly listen dripping water—they must find spring. They found one presently, Tom said time rest again. Both cruelly tired, yet Becky said thought could go little farther. She surprised hear Tom dissent. She could understand it. They sat down, Tom fastened candle wall front clay. Thought soon busy; nothing said time. Then Becky broke silence: “Tom, I hungry!” Tom took something pocket. “Do remember this?” said he. Becky almost smiled. “It wedding-cake, Tom.” “Yes—I wish big barrel, got.” “I saved picnic us dream on, Tom, way grownup people wedding-cake—but our—” She dropped sentence was. Tom divided cake Becky ate good appetite, Tom nibbled moiety. There abundance cold water finish feast with. By-and-by Becky suggested move again. Tom silent moment. Then said: “Becky, bear I tell something?” Becky’s face paled, thought could. “Well, then, Becky, must stay here, water drink. That little piece last candle!” Becky gave loose tears wailings. Tom could comfort her, little effect. At length Becky said: “Tom!” “Well, Becky?” “They miss us hunt us!” “Yes, will! Certainly will!” “Maybe hunting us now, Tom.” “Why, I reckon maybe are. I hope are.” “When would miss us, Tom?” “When get back boat, I reckon.” “Tom, might dark then—would notice come?” “I know. But anyway, mother would miss soon got home.” A frightened look Becky’s face brought Tom senses saw made blunder. Becky gone home night! The children became silent thoughtful. In moment new burst grief Becky showed Tom thing mind struck also—that Sabbath morning might half spent Mrs. Thatcher discovered Becky Mrs. Harper’s. The children fastened eyes upon bit candle watched melt slowly pitilessly away; saw half inch wick stand alone last; saw feeble flame rise fall, climb thin column smoke, linger top moment, then—the horror utter darkness reigned! How long afterward Becky came slow consciousness crying Tom’s arms, neither could tell. All knew was, seemed mighty stretch time, awoke dead stupor sleep resumed miseries more. Tom said might Sunday, now—maybe Monday. He tried get Becky talk, sorrows oppressive, hopes gone. Tom said must missed long ago, doubt search going on. He would shout maybe one would come. He tried it; darkness distant echoes sounded hideously tried more. The hours wasted away, hunger came torment captives again. A portion Tom’s half cake left; divided ate it. But seemed hungrier before. The poor morsel food whetted desire. By-and-by Tom said: “SH! Did hear that?” Both held breath listened. There sound like faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, leading Becky hand, started groping corridor direction. Presently listened again; sound heard, apparently little nearer. “It them!” said Tom; “they coming! Come along, Becky—we right now!” The joy prisoners almost overwhelming. Their speed slow, however, pitfalls somewhat common, guarded against. They shortly came one stop. It might three feet deep, might hundred—there passing rate. Tom got breast reached far could. No bottom. They must stay wait searchers came. They listened; evidently distant shoutings growing distant! moment two gone altogether. The heart-sinking misery it! Tom whooped hoarse, use. He talked hopefully Becky; age anxious waiting passed sounds came again. The children groped way back spring. The weary time dragged on; slept again, awoke famished woe-stricken. Tom believed must Tuesday time. Now idea struck him. There side passages near hand. It would better explore bear weight heavy time idleness. He took kite-line pocket, tied projection, Becky started, Tom lead, unwinding line groped along. At end twenty steps corridor ended “jumping-off place.” Tom got knees felt below, far around corner could reach hands conveniently; made effort stretch yet little farther right, moment, twenty yards away, human hand, holding candle, appeared behind rock! Tom lifted glorious shout, instantly hand followed body belonged to—Injun Joe’s! Tom paralyzed; could move. He vastly gratified next moment, see “Spaniard” take heels get sight. Tom wondered Joe recognized voice come killed testifying court. But echoes must disguised voice. Without doubt, it, reasoned. Tom’s fright weakened every muscle body. He said strength enough get back spring would stay there, nothing tempt run risk meeting Injun Joe again. He careful keep Becky seen. He told shouted “for luck.” But hunger wretchedness rise superior fears long run. Another tedious wait spring another long sleep brought changes. The children awoke tortured raging hunger. Tom believed must Wednesday Thursday even Friday Saturday, now, search given over. He proposed explore another passage. He felt willing risk Injun Joe terrors. But Becky weak. She sunk dreary apathy would roused. She said would wait, now, was, die—it would long. She told Tom go kite-line explore chose; implored come back every little speak her; made promise awful time came, would stay hold hand over. Tom kissed her, choking sensation throat, made show confident finding searchers escape cave; took kite-line hand went groping one passages hands knees, distressed hunger sick bodings coming doom. CHAPTER XXXII TUESDAY afternoon came, waned twilight. The village St. Petersburg still mourned. The lost children found. Public prayers offered them, many many private prayer petitioner’s whole heart it; still good news came cave. The majority searchers given quest gone back daily avocations, saying plain children could never found. Mrs. Thatcher ill, great part time delirious. People said heartbreaking hear call child, raise head listen whole minute time, lay wearily moan. Aunt Polly drooped settled melancholy, gray hair grown almost white. The village went rest Tuesday night, sad forlorn. Away middle night wild peal burst village bells, moment streets swarming frantic half-clad people, shouted, “Turn out! turn out! found! found!” Tin pans horns added din, population massed moved toward river, met children coming open carriage drawn shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined homeward march, swept magnificently main street roaring huzzah huzzah! The village illuminated; nobody went bed again; greatest night little town ever seen. During first half-hour procession villagers filed Judge Thatcher’s house, seized saved ones kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, tried speak could not—and drifted raining tears place. Aunt Polly’s happiness complete, Mrs. Thatcher’s nearly so. It would complete, however, soon messenger dispatched great news cave get word husband. Tom lay upon sofa eager auditory told history wonderful adventure, putting many striking additions adorn withal; closed description left Becky went exploring expedition; followed two avenues far kite-line would reach; followed third fullest stretch kite-line, turn back glimpsed far-off speck looked like daylight; dropped line groped toward it, pushed head shoulders small hole, saw broad Mississippi rolling by! And happened night would seen speck daylight would explored passage more! He told went back Becky broke good news told fret stuff, tired, knew going die, wanted to. He described labored convinced her; almost died joy groped actually saw blue speck daylight; pushed way hole helped out; sat cried gladness; men came along skiff Tom hailed told situation famished condition; men believe wild tale first, “because,” said they, “you five miles river valley cave in”—then took aboard, rowed house, gave supper, made rest till two three hours dark brought home. Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher handful searchers tracked out, cave, twine clews strung behind them, informed great news. Three days nights toil hunger cave shaken once, Tom Becky soon discovered. They bedridden Wednesday Thursday, seemed grow tired worn, time. Tom got about, little, Thursday, downtown Friday, nearly whole ever Saturday; Becky leave room Sunday, looked passed wasting illness. Tom learned Huck’s sickness went see Friday, could admitted bedroom; neither could Saturday Sunday. He admitted daily that, warned keep still adventure introduce exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed see obeyed. At home Tom learned Cardiff Hill event; also “ragged man’s” body eventually found river near ferry-landing; drowned trying escape, perhaps. About fortnight Tom’s rescue cave, started visit Huck, grown plenty strong enough, now, hear exciting talk, Tom would interest him, thought. Judge Thatcher’s house Tom’s way, stopped see Becky. The Judge friends set Tom talking, one asked ironically would like go cave again. Tom said thought would mind it. The Judge said: “Well, others like you, Tom, I least doubt. But taken care that. Nobody get lost cave more.” “Why?” “Because I big door sheathed boiler iron two weeks ago, triple-locked—and I got keys.” Tom turned white sheet. “What matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch glass water!” The water brought thrown Tom’s face. “Ah, right. What matter you, Tom?” “Oh, Judge, Injun Joe’s cave!” CHAPTER XXXIII WITHIN minutes news spread, dozen skiff-loads men way McDougal’s cave, ferryboat, well filled passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer skiff bore Judge Thatcher. When cave door unlocked, sorrowful sight presented dim twilight place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon ground, dead, face close crack door, longing eyes fixed, latest moment, upon light cheer free world outside. Tom touched, knew experience wretch suffered. His pity moved, nevertheless felt abounding sense relief security, now, revealed degree fully appreciated vast weight dread lying upon since day lifted voice bloody-minded outcast. Injun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, blade broken two. The great foundation-beam door chipped hacked through, tedious labor; useless labor, too, was, native rock formed sill outside it, upon stubborn material knife wrought effect; damage done knife itself. But stony obstruction labor would useless still, beam wholly cut away Injun Joe could squeezed body door, knew it. So hacked place order something—in order pass weary time—in order employ tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could find half dozen bits candle stuck around crevices vestibule, left tourists; none now. The prisoner searched eaten them. He also contrived catch bats, these, also, eaten, leaving claws. The poor unfortunate starved death. In one place, near hand, stalagmite slowly growing ground ages, builded water-drip stalactite overhead. The captive broken stalagmite, upon stump placed stone, wherein scooped shallow hollow catch precious drop fell every three minutes dreary regularity clock-tick—a dessertspoonful four twenty hours. That drop falling Pyramids new; Troy fell; foundations Rome laid; Christ crucified; Conqueror created British empire; Columbus sailed; massacre Lexington “news.” It falling now; still falling things shall sunk afternoon history, twilight tradition, swallowed thick night oblivion. Has everything purpose mission? Did drop fall patiently five thousand years ready flitting human insect’s need? another important object accomplish ten thousand years come? No matter. It many many year since hapless half-breed scooped stone catch priceless drops, day tourist stares longest pathetic stone slow-dropping water comes see wonders McDougal’s cave. Injun Joe’s cup stands first list cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace” cannot rival it. Injun Joe buried near mouth cave; people flocked boats wagons towns farms hamlets seven miles around; brought children, sorts provisions, confessed almost satisfactory time funeral could hanging. This funeral stopped growth one thing—the petition governor Injun Joe’s pardon. The petition largely signed; many tearful eloquent meetings held, committee sappy women appointed go deep mourning wail around governor, implore merciful ass trample duty foot. Injun Joe believed killed five citizens village, that? If Satan would plenty weaklings ready scribble names pardon-petition, drip tear permanently impaired leaky water-works. The morning funeral Tom took Huck private place important talk. Huck learned Tom’s adventure Welshman Widow Douglas, time, Tom said reckoned one thing told him; thing wanted talk now. Huck’s face saddened. He said: “I know is. You got No. 2 never found anything whiskey. Nobody told you; I knowed must ’a’ ben you, soon I heard ’bout whiskey business; I knowed got money becuz would ’a’ got way told even mum everybody else. Tom, something always told would never get holt swag.” “Why, Huck, I never told tavern-keeper. _You_ know tavern right Saturday I went picnic. Do remember watch night?” “Oh yes! Why, seems ’bout year ago. It night I follered Injun Joe widder’s.” “_You_ followed him?” “Yes—but keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, I want souring mean tricks. If ben would Texas now, right.” Then Huck told entire adventure confidence Tom, heard Welshman’s part before. “Well,” said Huck, presently, coming back main question, “whoever nipped whiskey No. 2, nipped money, too, I reckon—anyways goner us, Tom.” “Huck, money ever No. 2!” “What!” Huck searched comrade’s face keenly. “Tom, got track money again?” “Huck, cave!” Huck’s eyes blazed. “Say again, Tom.” “The money’s cave!” “Tom—honest injun, now—is fun, earnest?” “Earnest, Huck—just earnest ever I life. Will go help get out?” “I bet I will! I blaze way get lost.” “Huck, without least little bit trouble world.” “Good wheat! What makes think money’s—” “Huck, wait till get there. If find I agree give drum every thing I got world. I will, jings.” “All right—it whiz. When say?” “Right now, say it. Are strong enough?” “Is far cave? I ben pins little, three four days, now, I cannot walk more’n mile, Tom—least I think I could.” “It five mile way anybody would go, Huck, mighty short cut anybody know about. Huck, I take right skiff. I float skiff there, I pull back myself. You need ever turn hand over.” “Less start right off, Tom.” “All right. We want bread meat, pipes, little bag two, two three kite-strings, new-fangled things call lucifer matches. I tell you, many’s time I wished I I before.” A trifle noon boys borrowed small skiff citizen absent, got way once. When several miles “Cave Hollow,” Tom said: “Now see bluff looks alike way cave hollow—no houses, wood-yards, bushes alike. But see white place yonder landslide? Well, one marks. We get ashore, now.” They landed. “Now, Huck, a-standing could touch hole I got fishing-pole. See find it.” Huck searched place about, found nothing. Tom proudly marched thick clump sumach bushes said: “Here are! Look it, Huck; snuggest hole country. You keep mum it. All along I wanting robber, I knew I would got thing like this, run across bother. We got now, keep quiet, let Joe Harper Ben Rogers in—because course got Gang, else would style it. Tom Sawyer’s Gang—it sounds splendid, it, Huck?” “Well, does, Tom. And rob?” “Oh, anybody. Waylay people—that mostly way.” “And kill them?” “No, always. Hive cave till raise ransom.” “What ransom?” “Money. You make raise can, off’n friends; kept year, raised kill them. That general way. Only kill women. You shut women, kill them. They always beautiful rich, awfully scared. You take watches things, always take hat talk polite. They anybody polite robbers—you see book. Well, women get loving you, cave week two weeks stop crying could get leave. If drove would turn right around come back. It books.” “Why, real bully, Tom. I believe better’n pirate.” “Yes, better ways, close home circuses that.” By time everything ready boys entered hole, Tom lead. They toiled way farther end tunnel, made spliced kite-strings fast moved on. A steps brought spring, Tom felt shudder quiver him. He showed Huck fragment candle-wick perched lump clay wall, described Becky watched flame struggle expire. The boys began quiet whispers, now, stillness gloom place oppressed spirits. They went on, presently entered followed Tom’s corridor reached “jumping-off place.” The candles revealed fact really precipice, steep clay hill twenty thirty feet high. Tom whispered: “Now I show something, Huck.” He held candle aloft said: “Look far around corner can. Do see that? There—on big rock yonder—done candle-smoke.” “Tom, _cross_!” “_Now_ Number Two? ‘_under cross_,’ hey? Right yonder’s I saw Injun Joe poke candle, Huck!” Huck stared mystic sign awhile, said shaky voice: “Tom, less git here!” “What! leave treasure?” “Yes—leave it. Injun Joe’s ghost round there, certain.” “No not, Huck, not. It would ha’nt place died—away mouth cave—five mile here.” “No, Tom, would not. It would hang round money. I know ways ghosts, you.” Tom began fear Huck right. Mis-givings gathered mind. But presently idea occurred him— “Lookyhere, Huck, fools making ourselves! Injun Joe’s ghost going come around cross!” The point well taken. It effect. “Tom, I think that. But so. It luck us, cross is. I reckon climb hunt box.” Tom went first, cutting rude steps clay hill descended. Huck followed. Four avenues opened small cavern great rock stood in. The boys examined three result. They found small recess one nearest base rock, pallet blankets spread it; also old suspender, bacon rind, well-gnawed bones two three fowls. But moneybox. The lads searched researched place, vain. Tom said: “He said _under_ cross. Well, comes nearest cross. It cannot rock itself, sets solid ground.” They searched everywhere more, sat discouraged. Huck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said: “Lookyhere, Huck, footprints candle-grease clay one side rock, sides. Now, for? I bet money _is_ rock. I going dig clay.” “That bad notion, Tom!” said Huck animation. Tom’s “real Barlow” once, dug four inches struck wood. “Hey, Huck!—you hear that?” Huck began dig scratch now. Some boards soon uncovered removed. They concealed natural chasm led rock. Tom got held candle far rock could, said could see end rift. He proposed explore. He stooped passed under; narrow way descended gradually. He followed winding course, first right, left, Huck heels. Tom turned short curve, by-and-by, exclaimed: “My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!” It treasure-box, sure enough, occupying snug little cavern, along empty powder-keg, couple guns leather cases, two three pairs old moccasins, leather belt, rubbish well soaked water-drip. “Got last!” said Huck, ploughing among tarnished coins hand. “My, rich, Tom!” “Huck, I always reckoned would get it. It good believe, _have_ got it, sure! Say—let us fool around here. Let us snake out. Let Me see I lift box.” It weighed fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, awkward fashion, could carry conveniently. “I thought so,” said; “_They_ carried like heavy, day ha’nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I right think fetching little bags along.” The money soon bags boys took cross rock. “Now less fetch guns things,” said Huck. “No, Huck—leave there. They tricks go robbing. We keep time, hold orgies there, too. It awful snug place orgies.” “What orgies?” “I dono. But robbers always orgies, course got them, too. Come along, Huck, long time. It getting late, I reckon. I hungry, too. We eat smoke get skiff.” They presently emerged clump sumach bushes, looked warily out, found coast clear, soon lunching smoking skiff. As sun dipped toward horizon pushed got way. Tom skimmed shore long twilight, chatting cheerily Huck, landed shortly dark. “Now, Huck,” said Tom, “we hide money loft widow’s woodshed, I come morning count divide, hunt place woods safe. Just lay quiet watch stuff till I run hook Benny Taylor’s little wagon; I gone minute.” He disappeared, presently returned wagon, put two small sacks it, threw old rags top them, started off, dragging cargo behind him. When boys reached Welshman’s house, stopped rest. Just move on, Welshman stepped said: “Hallo, that?” “Huck Tom Sawyer.” “Good! Come along me, boys, keeping everybody waiting. Here—hurry up, trot ahead—I haul wagon you. Why, light might be. Got bricks it?—or old metal?” “Old metal,” said Tom. “I judged so; boys town take trouble fool away time hunting six bits’ worth old iron sell foundry would make twice money regular work. But human nature—hurry along, hurry along!” The boys wanted know hurry about. “Never mind; see, get Widow Douglas’.” Huck said apprehension—for long used falsely accused: “Mr. Jones, nothing.” The Welshman laughed. “Well, I know, Huck, boy. I know that. Are widow good friends?” “Yes. Well, ben good friends me, anyway.” “All right, then. What want afraid for?” This question entirely answered Huck’s slow mind found pushed, along Tom, Mrs. Douglas’ drawing-room. Mr. Jones left wagon near door followed. The place grandly lighted, everybody consequence village there. The Thatchers there, Harpers, Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, minister, editor, great many more, dressed best. The widow received boys heartily one could well receive two looking beings. They covered clay candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson humiliation, frowned shook head Tom. Nobody suffered half much two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said: “Tom home, yet, I gave up; I stumbled Huck right door, I brought along hurry.” “And right,” said widow. “Come me, boys.” She took bedchamber said: “Now wash dress yourselves. Here two new suits clothes—shirts, socks, everything complete. They Huck’s—no, thanks, Huck—Mr. Jones bought one I other. But fit you. Get them. We wait—come slicked enough.” Then left. CHAPTER XXXIV HUCK said: “Tom, slope, find rope. The window high ground.” “Shucks! want slope for?” “Well, I used kind crowd. I cannot stand it. I going there, Tom.” “Oh, bother! It anything. I mind bit. I take care you.” Sid appeared. “Tom,” said he, “auntie waiting afternoon. Mary got Sunday clothes ready, everybody’s fretting you. Say—are grease clay, clothes?” “Now, Mr. Siddy, jist ’tend business. What blowout about, anyway?” “It one widow’s parties always having. This time Welshman sons, account scrape helped night. And say—I tell something, want know.” “Well, what?” “Why, old Mr. Jones going try spring something people tonight, I overheard tell auntie today it, secret, I reckon much secret now. Everybody knows—the widow, too, tries let not. Mr. Jones bound Huck here—could get along grand secret without Huck, know!” “Secret what, Sid?” “About Huck tracking robbers widow’s. I reckon Mr. Jones going make grand time surprise, I bet drop pretty flat.” Sid chuckled contented satisfied way. “Sid, told?” “Oh, never mind was. _Somebody_ told—that enough.” “Sid, one person town mean enough that, you. If Huck’s place would ’a’ sneaked hill never told anybody robbers. You cannot mean things, cannot bear see anybody praised good ones. There—no thanks, widow says”—and Tom cuffed Sid’s ears helped door several kicks. “Now go tell auntie dare—and tomorrow catch it!” Some minutes later widow’s guests supper-table, dozen children propped little side-tables room, fashion country day. At proper time Mr. Jones made little speech, thanked widow honor sons, said another person whose modesty— And forth on. He sprung secret Huck’s share adventure finest dramatic manner master of, surprise occasioned largely counterfeit clamorous effusive might happier circumstances. However, widow made pretty fair show astonishment, heaped many compliments much gratitude upon Huck almost forgot nearly intolerable discomfort new clothes entirely intolerable discomfort set target everybody’s gaze everybody’s laudations. The widow said meant give Huck home roof educated; could spare money would start business modest way. Tom’s chance come. He said: “Huck need it. Huck’s rich.” Nothing heavy strain upon good manners company kept back due proper complimentary laugh pleasant joke. But silence little awkward. Tom broke it: “Huck’s got money. Maybe believe it, got lots it. Oh, need smile—I reckon I show you. You wait minute.” Tom ran doors. The company looked perplexed interest—and inquiringly Huck, tongue-tied. “Sid, ails Tom?” said Aunt Polly. “He—well, ever making boy out. I never—” Tom entered, struggling weight sacks, Aunt Polly finish sentence. Tom poured mass yellow coin upon table said: “There—what I tell you? Half Huck’s half mine!” The spectacle took general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke moment. Then unanimous call explanation. Tom said could furnish it, did. The tale long, brimful interest. There scarcely interruption one break charm flow. When finished, Mr. Jones said: “I thought I fixed little surprise occasion, amount anything now. This one makes sing mighty small, I willing allow.” The money counted. The sum amounted little twelve thousand dollars. It one present ever seen one time before, though several persons worth considerably property. CHAPTER XXXV THE reader may rest satisfied Tom’s Huck’s windfall made mighty stir poor little village St. Petersburg. So vast sum, actual cash, seemed next incredible. It talked about, gloated over, glorified, reason many citizens tottered strain unhealthy excitement. Every “haunted” house St. Petersburg neighboring villages dissected, plank plank, foundations dug ransacked hidden treasure—and boys, men—pretty grave, unromantic men, too, them. Wherever Tom Huck appeared courted, admired, stared at. The boys able remember remarks possessed weight before; sayings treasured repeated; everything seemed somehow regarded remarkable; evidently lost power saying commonplace things; moreover, past history raked discovered bear marks conspicuous originality. The village paper published biographical sketches boys. The Widow Douglas put Huck’s money six per cent., Judge Thatcher Tom’s Aunt Polly’s request. Each lad income, now, simply prodigious—a dollar every weekday year half Sundays. It minister got—no, promised—he generally could collect it. A dollar quarter week would board, lodge, school boy old simple days—and clothe wash him, too, matter. Judge Thatcher conceived great opinion Tom. He said commonplace boy would ever got daughter cave. When Becky told father, strict confidence, Tom taken whipping school, Judge visibly moved; pleaded grace mighty lie Tom told order shift whipping shoulders own, Judge said fine outburst noble, generous, magnanimous lie—a lie worthy hold head march history breast breast George Washington’s lauded Truth hatchet! Becky thought father never looked tall superb walked floor stamped foot said that. She went straight told Tom it. Judge Thatcher hoped see Tom great lawyer great soldier day. He said meant look Tom admitted National Military Academy afterward trained best law school country, order might ready either career both. Huck Finn’s wealth fact Widow Douglas’ protection introduced society—no, dragged it, hurled it—and sufferings almost could bear. The widow’s servants kept clean neat, combed brushed, bedded nightly unsympathetic sheets one little spot stain could press heart know friend. He eat knife fork; use napkin, cup, plate; learn book, go church; talk properly speech become insipid mouth; whithersoever turned, bars shackles civilization shut bound hand foot. He bravely bore miseries three weeks, one day turned missing. For forty-eight hours widow hunted everywhere great distress. The public profoundly concerned; searched high low, dragged river body. Early third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among old empty hogsheads behind abandoned slaughter-house, one found refugee. Huck slept there; breakfasted upon stolen odds ends food, lying off, now, comfort, pipe. He unkempt, uncombed, clad old ruin rags made picturesque days free happy. Tom routed out, told trouble causing, urged go home. Huck’s face lost tranquil content, took melancholy cast. He said: “Do talk it, Tom. I tried it, work; work, Tom. It me; I used it. The widder’s good me, friendly; I cannot stand ways. She makes get time every morning; makes wash, comb thunder; let sleep woodshed; I got wear blamed clothes smothers me, Tom; seem air git them, somehow; rotten nice I cannot set down, lay down, roll around anywher’s; I hain’t slid cellar-door for—well, ’pears years; I got go church sweat sweat—I hate ornery sermons! I cannot ketch fly there, I cannot chaw. I got wear shoes Sunday. The widder eats bell; goes bed bell; gits bell—everything’s awful reg’lar body cannot stand it.” “Well, everybody way, Huck.” “Tom, make difference. I everybody, I cannot _stand_ it. It awful tied so. And grub comes easy—I take interest vittles, way. I got ask go a-fishing; I got ask go a-swimming—dern’d I hain’t got ask everything. Well, I would got talk nice comfort—I would got go attic rip awhile, every day, git taste mouth, I would died, Tom. The widder would let smoke; would let yell, would let gape, stretch, scratch, folks—” [Then spasm special irritation injury]—“And dad fetch it, prayed time! I never see woman! I _had_ shove, Tom—I to. And besides, school’s going open, I would go it—well, I would stand _that_, Tom. Looky-here, Tom, rich cracked be. It worry worry, sweat sweat, a-wishing dead time. Now clothes suits me, bar’l suits me, I ever going shake more. Tom, I would ever got trouble ’a’ ben money; take sheer along your’n, give ten-center sometimes—not many times, becuz I give dern thing ’thout tollable hard git—and go beg widder.” “Oh, Huck, know I cannot that. ’Tain’t fair; besides try thing longer come like it.” “Like it! Yes—the way I would like hot stove I set long enough. No, Tom, I rich, I live cussed smothery houses. I like woods, river, hogsheads, I stick them, too. Blame all! would got guns, cave, fixed rob, dern foolishness got come spile all!” Tom saw opportunity— “Lookyhere, Huck, rich going keep back turning robber.” “No! Oh, good-licks; real dead-wood earnest, Tom?” “Just dead earnest I sitting here. But Huck, cannot let gang respectable, know.” Huck’s joy quenched. “Cannot let in, Tom? Did let go pirate?” “Yes, different. A robber high-toned pirate is—as general thing. In countries awful high nobility—dukes such.” “Now, Tom, hain’t always ben friendly me? You would shet out, would you, Tom? You would that, now, _would_ you, Tom?” “Huck, I would want to, I _don’t_ want to—but would people say? Why, would say, ‘Mph! Tom Sawyer’s Gang! pretty low characters it!’ They would mean you, Huck. You would like that, I would not.” Huck silent time, engaged mental struggle. Finally said: “Well, I go back widder month tackle see I come stand it, let b’long gang, Tom.” “All right, Huck, whiz! Come along, old chap, I ask widow let little, Huck.” “Will you, Tom—now you? That good. If let roughest things, I smoke private cuss private, crowd bust. When going start gang turn robbers?” “Oh, right off. We get boys together initiation tonight, maybe.” “Have which?” “Have initiation.” “What that?” “It swear stand one another, never tell gang’s secrets, even chopped flinders, kill anybody family hurts one gang.” “That gay—that mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.” “Well, I bet is. And swearing’s got done midnight, lonesomest, awfulest place find—a ha’nted house best, ripped now.” “Well, midnight’s good, anyway, Tom.” “Yes, is. And got swear coffin, sign blood.” “Now, something _like_! Why, million times bullier pirating. I stick widder till I rot, Tom; I git reg’lar ripper robber, everybody talking ’bout it, I reckon proud snaked wet.” CONCLUSION SO endeth chronicle. It strictly history _boy_, must stop here; story could go much without becoming history _man_. When one writes novel grown people, knows exactly stop—that is, marriage; writes juveniles, must stop best can. Most characters perform book still live, prosperous happy. Some day may seem worth take story younger ones see sort men women turned be; therefore wisest reveal part lives present.
