He much admired indeed. “He beautiful weathercock,” remarked one Town Councillors wished gain reputation artistic tastes; “only quite useful,” added, fearing lest people think unpractical, really not. “Why cannot like Happy Prince?” asked sensible mother little boy crying moon. “The Happy Prince never dreams crying anything.” “I glad one world quite happy,” muttered disappointed man gazed wonderful statue. “He looks like angel,” said Charity Children came cathedral bright scarlet cloaks clean white pinafores. “How know?” said Mathematical Master, “you never seen one.” “Ah! have, dreams,” answered children; Mathematical Master frowned looked severe, approve children dreaming. One night flew city little Swallow. His friends gone away Egypt six weeks before, stayed behind, love beautiful Reed. He met early spring flying river big yellow moth, attracted slender waist stopped talk her. “Shall I love you?” said Swallow, liked come point once, Reed made low bow. So flew round round her, touching water wings, making silver ripples. This courtship, lasted summer. “It ridiculous attachment,” twittered Swallows; “she money, far many relations”; indeed river quite full Reeds. Then, autumn came flew away. After gone felt lonely, began tire lady-love. “She conversation,” said, “and I afraid coquette, always flirting wind.” And certainly, whenever wind blew, Reed made graceful curtseys. “I admit domestic,” continued, “but I love travelling, wife, consequently, love travelling also.” “Will come away me?” said finally her; Reed shook head, attached home. “You trifling me,” cried. “I Pyramids. Good-bye!” flew away. All day long flew, night-time arrived city. “Where shall I put up?” said; “I hope town made preparations.” Then saw statue tall column. “I put there,” cried; “it fine position, plenty fresh air.” So alighted feet Happy Prince. “I golden bedroom,” said softly looked round, prepared go sleep; putting head wing large drop water fell him. “What curious thing!” cried; “there single cloud sky, stars quite clear bright, yet raining. The climate north Europe really dreadful. The Reed used like rain, merely selfishness.” Then another drop fell. “What use statue cannot keep rain off?” said; “I must look good chimney-pot,” determined fly away. But opened wings, third drop fell, looked up, saw—Ah! see? The eyes Happy Prince filled tears, tears running golden cheeks. His face beautiful moonlight little Swallow filled pity. “Who you?” said. “I Happy Prince.” “Why weeping then?” asked Swallow; “you quite drenched me.” “When I alive human heart,” answered statue, “I know tears were, I lived Palace Sans-Souci, sorrow allowed enter. In daytime I played companions garden, evening I led dance Great Hall. Round garden ran lofty wall, I never cared ask lay beyond it, everything beautiful. My courtiers called Happy Prince, happy indeed I was, pleasure happiness. So I lived, I died. And I dead set high I see ugliness misery city, though heart made lead yet I cannot chose weep.” “What! solid gold?” said Swallow himself. He polite make personal remarks loud. “Far away,” continued statue low musical voice, “far away little street poor house. One windows open, I see woman seated table. Her face thin worn, coarse, red hands, pricked needle, seamstress. She embroidering passion-flowers satin gown loveliest Queen’s maids-of-honour wear next Court-ball. In bed corner room little boy lying ill. He fever, asking oranges. His mother nothing give river water, crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, bring ruby sword-hilt? My feet fastened pedestal I cannot move.” “I waited Egypt,” said Swallow. “My friends flying Nile, talking large lotus-flowers. Soon go sleep tomb great King. The King painted coffin. He wrapped yellow linen, embalmed spices. Round neck chain pale green jade, hands like withered leaves.” “Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said Prince, “will stay one night, messenger? The boy thirsty, mother sad.” “I think I like boys,” answered Swallow. “Last summer, I staying river, two rude boys, miller’s sons, always throwing stones me. They never hit me, course; swallows fly far well that, besides, I come family famous agility; still, mark disrespect.” But Happy Prince looked sad little Swallow sorry. “It cold here,” said; “but I stay one night, messenger.” “Thank you, little Swallow,” said Prince. So Swallow picked great ruby Prince’s sword, flew away beak roofs town. He passed cathedral tower, white marble angels sculptured. He passed palace heard sound dancing. A beautiful girl came balcony lover. “How wonderful stars are,” said her, “and wonderful power love!” “I hope dress ready time State-ball,” answered; “I ordered passion-flowers embroidered it; seamstresses lazy.” He passed river, saw lanterns hanging masts ships. He passed Ghetto, saw old Jews bargaining other, weighing money copper scales. At last came poor house looked in. The boy tossing feverishly bed, mother fallen asleep, tired. In hopped, laid great ruby table beside woman’s thimble. Then flew gently round bed, fanning boy’s forehead wings. “How cool I feel,” said boy, “I must getting better”; sank delicious slumber. Then Swallow flew back Happy Prince, told done. “It curious,” remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although cold.” “That done good action,” said Prince. And little Swallow began think, fell asleep. Thinking always made sleepy. When day broke flew river bath. “What remarkable phenomenon,” said Professor Ornithology passing bridge. “A swallow winter!” And wrote long letter local newspaper. Every one quoted it, full many words could understand. “To-night I go Egypt,” said Swallow, high spirits prospect. He visited public monuments, sat long time top church steeple. Wherever went Sparrows chirruped, said other, “What distinguished stranger!” enjoyed much. When moon rose flew back Happy Prince. “Have commissions Egypt?” cried; “I starting.” “Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said Prince, “will stay one night longer?” “I waited Egypt,” answered Swallow. “To-morrow friends fly Second Cataract. The river-horse couches among bulrushes, great granite throne sits God Memnon. All night long watches stars, morning star shines utters one cry joy, silent. At noon yellow lions come water’s edge drink. They eyes like green beryls, roar louder roar cataract.” “Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said Prince, “far away across city I see young man garret. He leaning desk covered papers, tumbler side bunch withered violets. His hair brown crisp, lips red pomegranate, large dreamy eyes. He trying finish play Director Theatre, cold write more. There fire grate, hunger made faint.” “I wait one night longer,” said Swallow, really good heart. “Shall I take another ruby?” “Alas! I ruby now,” said Prince; “my eyes I left. They made rare sapphires, brought India thousand years ago. Pluck one take him. He sell jeweller, buy food firewood, finish play.” “Dear Prince,” said Swallow, “I cannot that”; began weep. “Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said Prince, “do I command you.” So Swallow plucked Prince’s eye, flew away student’s garret. It easy enough get in, hole roof. Through darted, came room. The young man head buried hands, hear flutter bird’s wings, looked found beautiful sapphire lying withered violets. “I beginning appreciated,” cried; “this great admirer. Now I finish play,” looked quite happy. The next day Swallow flew harbour. He sat mast large vessel watched sailors hauling big chests hold ropes. “Heave a-hoy!” shouted chest came up. “I going Egypt”! cried Swallow, nobody minded, moon rose flew back Happy Prince. “I come bid good-bye,” cried. “Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said Prince, “will stay one night longer?” “It winter,” answered Swallow, “and chill snow soon here. In Egypt sun warm green palm-trees, crocodiles lie mud look lazily them. My companions building nest Temple Baalbec, pink white doves watching them, cooing other. Dear Prince, I must leave you, I never forget you, next spring I bring back two beautiful jewels place given away. The ruby shall redder red rose, sapphire shall blue great sea.” “In square below,” said Happy Prince, “there stands little match-girl. She let matches fall gutter, spoiled. Her father beat bring home money, crying. She shoes stockings, little head bare. Pluck eye, give her, father beat her.” “I stay one night longer,” said Swallow, “but I cannot pluck eye. You would quite blind then.” “Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said Prince, “do I command you.” So plucked Prince’s eye, darted it. He swooped past match-girl, slipped jewel palm hand. “What lovely bit glass,” cried little girl; ran home, laughing. Then Swallow came back Prince. “You blind now,” said, “so I stay always.” “No, little Swallow,” said poor Prince, “you must go away Egypt.” “I stay always,” said Swallow, slept Prince’s feet. All next day sat Prince’s shoulder, told stories seen strange lands. He told red ibises, stand long rows banks Nile, catch gold-fish beaks; Sphinx, old world itself, lives desert, knows everything; merchants, walk slowly side camels, carry amber beads hands; King Mountains Moon, black ebony, worships large crystal; great green snake sleeps palm-tree, twenty priests feed honey-cakes; pygmies sail big lake large flat leaves, always war butterflies. “Dear little Swallow,” said Prince, “you tell marvellous things, marvellous anything suffering men women. There Mystery great Misery. Fly city, little Swallow, tell see there.” So Swallow flew great city, saw rich making merry beautiful houses, beggars sitting gates. He flew dark lanes, saw white faces starving children looking listlessly black streets. Under archway bridge two little boys lying one another’s arms try keep warm. “How hungry are!” said. “You must lie here,” shouted Watchman, wandered rain. Then flew back told Prince seen. “I covered fine gold,” said Prince, “you must take off, leaf leaf, give poor; living always think gold make happy.” Leaf leaf fine gold Swallow picked off, till Happy Prince looked quite dull grey. Leaf leaf fine gold brought poor, children’s faces grew rosier, laughed played games street. “We bread now!” cried. Then snow came, snow came frost. The streets looked made silver, bright glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung eaves houses, everybody went furs, little boys wore scarlet caps skated ice. The poor little Swallow grew colder colder, would leave Prince, loved well. He picked crumbs outside baker’s door baker looking tried keep warm flapping wings. But last knew going die. He strength fly Prince’s shoulder more. “Good-bye, dear Prince!” murmured, “will let kiss hand?” “I glad going Egypt last, little Swallow,” said Prince, “you stayed long here; must kiss lips, I love you.” “It Egypt I going,” said Swallow. “I going House Death. Death brother Sleep, not?” And kissed Happy Prince lips, fell dead feet. At moment curious crack sounded inside statue, something broken. The fact leaden heart snapped right two. It certainly dreadfully hard frost. Early next morning Mayor walking square company Town Councillors. As passed column looked statue: “Dear me! shabby Happy Prince looks!” said. “How shabby indeed!” cried Town Councillors, always agreed Mayor; went look it. “The ruby fallen sword, eyes gone, golden longer,” said Mayor fact, “he little better beggar!” “Little better beggar,” said Town Councillors. “And actually dead bird feet!” continued Mayor. “We must really issue proclamation birds allowed die here.” And Town Clerk made note suggestion. So pulled statue Happy Prince. “As longer beautiful longer useful,” said Art Professor University. Then melted statue furnace, Mayor held meeting Corporation decide done metal. “We must another statue, course,” said, “and shall statue myself.” “Of myself,” said Town Councillors, quarrelled. When I last heard quarrelling still. “What strange thing!” said overseer workmen foundry. “This broken lead heart melt furnace. We must throw away.” So threw dust-heap dead Swallow also lying. “Bring two precious things city,” said God one His Angels; Angel brought Him leaden heart dead bird. “You rightly chosen,” said God, “for garden Paradise little bird shall sing evermore, city gold Happy Prince shall praise me.” The Nightingale Rose. “SHE said would dance I brought red roses,” cried young Student; “but garden red rose.” From nest holm-oak tree Nightingale heard him, looked leaves, wondered. “No red rose garden!” cried, beautiful eyes filled tears. “Ah, little things happiness depend! I read wise men written, secrets philosophy mine, yet want red rose life made wretched.” “Here last true lover,” said Nightingale. “Night night I sung him, though I knew not: night night I told story stars, I see him. His hair dark hyacinth-blossom, lips red rose desire; passion made face like pale ivory, sorrow set seal upon brow.” “The Prince gives ball to-morrow night,” murmured young Student, “and love company. If I bring red rose dance till dawn. If I bring red rose, I shall hold arms, lean head upon shoulder, hand clasped mine. But red rose garden, I shall sit lonely, pass by. She heed me, heart break.” “Here indeed true lover,” said Nightingale. “What I sing of, suffers—what joy me, pain. Surely Love wonderful thing. It precious emeralds, dearer fine opals. Pearls pomegranates cannot buy it, set forth marketplace. It may purchased merchants, weighed balance gold.” “The musicians sit gallery,” said young Student, “and play upon stringed instruments, love dance sound harp violin. She dance lightly feet touch floor, courtiers gay dresses throng round her. But dance, I red rose give her”; flung grass, buried face hands, wept. “Why weeping?” asked little Green Lizard, ran past tail air. “Why, indeed?” said Butterfly, fluttering sunbeam. “Why, indeed?” whispered Daisy neighbour, soft, low voice. “He weeping red rose,” said Nightingale. “For red rose?” cried; “how ridiculous!” little Lizard, something cynic, laughed outright. But Nightingale understood secret Student’s sorrow, sat silent oak-tree, thought mystery Love. Suddenly spread brown wings flight, soared air. She passed grove like shadow, like shadow sailed across garden. In centre grass-plot standing beautiful Rose-tree, saw flew it, lit upon spray. “Give red rose,” cried, “and I sing sweetest song.” But Tree shook head. “My roses white,” answered; “as white foam sea, whiter snow upon mountain. But go brother grows round old sun-dial, perhaps give want.” So Nightingale flew Rose-tree growing round old sun-dial. “Give red rose,” cried, “and I sing sweetest song.” But Tree shook head. “My roses yellow,” answered; “as yellow hair mermaiden sits upon amber throne, yellower daffodil blooms meadow mower comes scythe. But go brother grows beneath Student’s window, perhaps give want.” So Nightingale flew Rose-tree growing beneath Student’s window. “Give red rose,” cried, “and I sing sweetest song.” But Tree shook head. “My roses red,” answered, “as red feet dove, redder great fans coral wave wave ocean-cavern. But winter chilled veins, frost nipped buds, storm broken branches, I shall roses year.” “One red rose I want,” cried Nightingale, “only one red rose! Is way I get it?” “There way,” answered Tree; “but terrible I dare tell you.” “Tell me,” said Nightingale, “I afraid.” “If want red rose,” said Tree, “you must build music moonlight, stain heart’s-blood. You must sing breast thorn. All night long must sing me, thorn must pierce heart, life-blood must flow veins, become mine.” “Death great price pay red rose,” cried Nightingale, “and Life dear all. It pleasant sit green wood, watch Sun chariot gold, Moon chariot pearl. Sweet scent hawthorn, sweet bluebells hide valley, heather blows hill. Yet Love better Life, heart bird compared heart man?” So spread brown wings flight, soared air. She swept garden like shadow, like shadow sailed grove. The young Student still lying grass, left him, tears yet dry beautiful eyes. “Be happy,” cried Nightingale, “be happy; shall red rose. I build music moonlight, stain heart’s-blood. All I ask return true lover, Love wiser Philosophy, though wise, mightier Power, though mighty. Flame-coloured wings, coloured like flame body. His lips sweet honey, breath like frankincense.” The Student looked grass, listened, could understand Nightingale saying him, knew things written books. But Oak-tree understood, felt sad, fond little Nightingale built nest branches. “Sing one last song,” whispered; “I shall feel lonely gone.” So Nightingale sang Oak-tree, voice like water bubbling silver jar. When finished song Student got up, pulled note-book lead-pencil pocket. “She form,” said himself, walked away grove—“that cannot denied her; got feeling? I afraid not. In fact, like artists; style, without sincerity. She would sacrifice others. She thinks merely music, everybody knows arts selfish. Still, must admitted beautiful notes voice. What pity mean anything, practical good.” And went room, lay little pallet-bed, began think love; and, time, fell asleep. And Moon shone heavens Nightingale flew Rose-tree, set breast thorn. All night long sang breast thorn, cold crystal Moon leaned listened. All night long sang, thorn went deeper deeper breast, life-blood ebbed away her. She sang first birth love heart boy girl. And top-most spray Rose-tree blossomed marvellous rose, petal following petal, song followed song. Pale it, first, mist hangs river—pale feet morning, silver wings dawn. As shadow rose mirror silver, shadow rose water-pool, rose blossomed topmost spray Tree. But Tree cried Nightingale press closer thorn. “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried Tree, “or Day come rose finished.” So Nightingale pressed closer thorn, louder louder grew song, sang birth passion soul man maid. And delicate flush pink came leaves rose, like flush face bridegroom kisses lips bride. But thorn yet reached heart, rose’s heart remained white, Nightingale’s heart’s-blood crimson heart rose. And Tree cried Nightingale press closer thorn. “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried Tree, “or Day come rose finished.” So Nightingale pressed closer thorn, thorn touched heart, fierce pang pain shot her. Bitter, bitter pain, wilder wilder grew song, sang Love perfected Death, Love dies tomb. And marvellous rose became crimson, like rose eastern sky. Crimson girdle petals, crimson ruby heart. But Nightingale’s voice grew fainter, little wings began beat, film came eyes. Fainter fainter grew song, felt something choking throat. Then gave one last burst music. The white Moon heard it, forgot dawn, lingered sky. The red rose heard it, trembled ecstasy, opened petals cold morning air. Echo bore purple cavern hills, woke sleeping shepherds dreams. It floated reeds river, carried message sea. “Look, look!” cried Tree, “the rose finished now”; Nightingale made answer, lying dead long grass, thorn heart. And noon Student opened window looked out. “Why, wonderful piece luck!” cried; “here red rose! I never seen rose like life. It beautiful I sure long Latin name”; leaned plucked it. Then put hat, ran Professor’s house rose hand. The daughter Professor sitting doorway winding blue silk reel, little dog lying feet. “You said would dance I brought red rose,” cried Student. “Here reddest rose world. You wear to-night next heart, dance together tell I love you.” But girl frowned. “I afraid go dress,” answered; “and, besides, Chamberlain’s nephew sent real jewels, everybody knows jewels cost far flowers.” “Well, upon word, ungrateful,” said Student angrily; threw rose street, fell gutter, cart-wheel went it. “Ungrateful!” said girl. “I tell what, rude; and, all, you? Only Student. Why, I believe even got silver buckles shoes Chamberlain’s nephew has”; got chair went house. “What silly thing Love is,” said Student walked away. “It half useful Logic, prove anything, always telling one things going happen, making one believe things true. In fact, quite unpractical, and, age practical everything, I shall go back Philosophy study Metaphysics.” So returned room pulled great dusty book, began read. The Selfish Giant. EVERY afternoon, coming school, children used go play Giant’s garden. It large lovely garden, soft green grass. Here grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, twelve peach-trees spring-time broke delicate blossoms pink pearl, autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat trees sang sweetly children used stop games order listen them. “How happy here!” cried other. One day Giant came back. He visit friend Cornish ogre, stayed seven years. After seven years said say, conversation limited, determined return castle. When arrived saw children playing garden. “What here?” cried gruff voice, children ran away. “My garden garden,” said Giant; “any one understand that, I allow nobody play myself.” So built high wall round it, put notice-board. TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED He selfish Giant. The poor children nowhere play. They tried play road, road dusty full hard stones, like it. They used wander round high wall lessons over, talk beautiful garden inside. “How happy there,” said other. Then Spring came, country little blossoms little birds. Only garden Selfish Giant still winter. The birds care sing children, trees forgot blossom. Once beautiful flower put head grass, saw notice-board sorry children slipped back ground again, went sleep. The people pleased Snow Frost. “Spring forgotten garden,” cried, “so live year round.” The Snow covered grass great white cloak, Frost painted trees silver. Then invited North Wind stay them, came. He wrapped furs, roared day garden, blew chimney-pots down. “This delightful spot,” said, “we must ask Hail visit.” So Hail came. Every day three hours rattled roof castle till broke slates, ran round round garden fast could go. He dressed grey, breath like ice. “I cannot understand Spring late coming,” said Selfish Giant, sat window looked cold white garden; “I hope change weather.” But Spring never came, Summer. The Autumn gave golden fruit every garden, Giant’s garden gave none. “He selfish,” said. So always Winter there, North Wind, Hail, Frost, Snow danced trees. One morning Giant lying awake bed heard lovely music. It sounded sweet ears thought must King’s musicians passing by. It really little linnet singing outside window, long since heard bird sing garden seemed beautiful music world. Then Hail stopped dancing head, North Wind ceased roaring, delicious perfume came open casement. “I believe Spring come last,” said Giant; jumped bed looked out. What see? He saw wonderful sight. Through little hole wall children crept in, sitting branches trees. In every tree could see little child. And trees glad children back covered blossoms, waving arms gently children’s heads. The birds flying twittering delight, flowers looking green grass laughing. It lovely scene, one corner still winter. It farthest corner garden, standing little boy. He small could reach branches tree, wandering round it, crying bitterly. The poor tree still quite covered frost snow, North Wind blowing roaring it. “Climb up! little boy,” said Tree, bent branches low could; boy tiny. And Giant’s heart melted looked out. “How selfish I been!” said; “now I know Spring would come here. I put poor little boy top tree, I knock wall, garden shall children’s playground ever ever.” He really sorry done. So crept downstairs opened front door quite softly, went garden. But children saw frightened ran away, garden became winter again. Only little boy run, eyes full tears see Giant coming. And Giant stole behind took gently hand, put tree. And tree broke blossom, birds came sang it, little boy stretched two arms flung round Giant’s neck, kissed him. And children, saw Giant wicked longer, came running back, came Spring. “It garden now, little children,” said Giant, took great axe knocked wall. And people going market twelve clock found Giant playing children beautiful garden ever seen. All day long played, evening came Giant bid good-bye. “But little companion?” said: “the boy I put tree.” The Giant loved best kissed him. “We know,” answered children; “he gone away.” “You must tell sure come to-morrow,” said Giant. But children said know lived, never seen before; Giant felt sad. Every afternoon, school over, children came played Giant. But little boy Giant loved never seen again. The Giant kind children, yet longed first little friend, often spoke him. “How I would like see him!” used say. Years went over, Giant grew old feeble. He could play more, sat huge armchair, watched children games, admired garden. “I many beautiful flowers,” said; “but children beautiful flowers all.” One winter morning looked window dressing. He hate Winter now, knew merely Spring asleep, flowers resting. Suddenly rubbed eyes wonder, looked looked. It certainly marvellous sight. In farthest corner garden tree quite covered lovely white blossoms. Its branches golden, silver fruit hung them, underneath stood little boy loved. Downstairs ran Giant great joy, garden. He hastened across grass, came near child. And came quite close face grew red anger, said, “Who hath dared wound thee?” For palms child’s hands prints two nails, prints two nails little feet. “Who hath dared wound thee?” cried Giant; “tell me, I may take big sword slay him.” “Nay!” answered child; “but wounds Love.” “Who art thou?” said Giant, strange awe fell him, knelt little child. And child smiled Giant, said him, “You let play garden, to-day shall come garden, Paradise.” And children ran afternoon, found Giant lying dead tree, covered white blossoms. The Devoted Friend. ONE morning old Water-rat put head hole. He bright beady eyes stiff grey whiskers tail like long bit black india-rubber. The little ducks swimming pond, looking like lot yellow canaries, mother, pure white real red legs, trying teach stand heads water. “You never best society unless stand heads,” kept saying them; every showed done. But little ducks paid attention her. They young know advantage society all. “What disobedient children!” cried old Water-rat; “they really deserve drowned.” “Nothing kind,” answered Duck, “every one must make beginning, parents cannot patient.” “Ah! I know nothing feelings parents,” said Water-rat; “I family man. In fact, I never married, I never intend be. Love well way, friendship much higher. Indeed, I know nothing world either nobler rarer devoted friendship.” “And what, pray, idea duties devoted friend?” asked Green Linnet, sitting willow-tree hard by, overheard conversation. “Yes, I want know,” said Duck; swam away end pond, stood upon head, order give children good example. “What silly question!” cried Water-rat. “I expect devoted friend devoted me, course.” “And would return?” said little bird, swinging upon silver spray, flapping tiny wings. “I understand you,” answered Water-rat. “Let tell story subject,” said Linnet. “Is story me?” asked Water-rat. “If so, I listen it, I extremely fond fiction.” “It applicable you,” answered Linnet; flew down, alighting upon bank, told story The Devoted Friend. “Once upon time,” said Linnet, “there honest little fellow named Hans.” “Was distinguished?” asked Water-rat. “No,” answered Linnet, “I think distinguished all, except kind heart, funny round good-humoured face. He lived tiny cottage himself, every day worked garden. In country-side garden lovely his. Sweet-william grew there, Gilly-flowers, Shepherds’-purses, Fair-maids France. There damask Roses, yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, gold, purple Violets white. Columbine Ladysmock, Marjoram Wild Basil, Cowslip Flower-de-luce, Daffodil Clove-Pink bloomed blossomed proper order months went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, always beautiful things look at, pleasant odours smell. “Little Hans great many friends, devoted friend big Hugh Miller. Indeed, devoted rich Miller little Hans, would never go garden without leaning wall plucking large nosegay, handful sweet herbs, filling pockets plums cherries fruit season. “‘Real friends everything common,’ Miller used say, little Hans nodded smiled, felt proud friend noble ideas. “Sometimes, indeed, neighbours thought strange rich Miller never gave little Hans anything return, though hundred sacks flour stored away mill, six milch cows, large flock woolly sheep; Hans never troubled head things, nothing gave greater pleasure listen wonderful things Miller used say unselfishness true friendship. “So little Hans worked away garden. During spring, summer, autumn happy, winter came, fruit flowers bring market, suffered good deal cold hunger, often go bed without supper dried pears hard nuts. In winter, also, extremely lonely, Miller never came see then. “‘There good going see little Hans long snow lasts,’ Miller used say wife, ‘for people trouble left alone, bothered visitors. That least idea friendship, I sure I right. So I shall wait till spring comes, I shall pay visit, able give large basket primroses make happy.’ “‘You certainly thoughtful others,’ answered Wife, sat comfortable armchair big pinewood fire; ‘very thoughtful indeed. It quite treat hear talk friendship. I sure clergyman could say beautiful things do, though live three-storied house, wear gold ring little finger.’ “‘But could ask little Hans here?’ said Miller’s youngest son. ‘If poor Hans trouble I give half porridge, show white rabbits.’ “‘What silly boy are!’ cried Miller; ‘I really know use sending school. You seem learn anything. Why, little Hans came here, saw warm fire, good supper, great cask red wine, might get envious, envy terrible thing, would spoil anybody’s nature. I certainly allow Hans’ nature spoiled. I best friend, I always watch him, see led temptations. Besides, Hans came here, might ask let flour credit, I could do. Flour one thing, friendship another, confused. Why, words spelt differently, mean quite different things. Everybody see that.’ “‘How well talk!’ said Miller’s Wife, pouring large glass warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy. It like church.’ “‘Lots people act well,’ answered Miller; ‘but people talk well, shows talking much difficult thing two, much finer thing also’; looked sternly across table little son, felt ashamed hung head down, grew quite scarlet, began cry tea. However, young must excuse him.” “Is end story?” asked Water-rat. “Certainly not,” answered Linnet, “that beginning.” “Then quite behind age,” said Water-rat. “Every good story-teller nowadays starts end, goes beginning, concludes middle. That new method. I heard day critic walking round pond young man. He spoke matter great length, I sure must right, blue spectacles bald head, whenever young man made remark, always answered ‘Pooh!’ But pray go story. I like Miller immensely. I kinds beautiful sentiments myself, great sympathy us.” “Well,” said Linnet, hopping one leg other, “as soon winter over, primroses began open pale yellow stars, Miller said wife would go see little Hans. “‘Why, good heart have!’ cried Wife; ‘you always thinking others. And mind take big basket flowers.’ “So Miller tied sails windmill together strong iron chain, went hill basket arm. “‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said Miller. “‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning spade, smiling ear ear. “‘And winter?’ said Miller. “‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it good ask, good indeed. I afraid I rather hard time it, spring come, I quite happy, flowers well.’ “‘We often talked winter, Hans,’ said Miller, ‘and wondered getting on.’ “‘That kind you,’ said Hans; ‘I half afraid forgotten me.’ “‘Hans, I surprised you,’ said Miller; ‘friendship never forgets. That wonderful thing it, I afraid understand poetry life. How lovely primroses looking, by-the-bye!” “‘They certainly lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and lucky thing I many. I going bring market sell Burgomaster’s daughter, buy back wheelbarrow money.’ “‘Buy back wheelbarrow? You mean say sold it? What stupid thing do!’ “‘Well, fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I obliged to. You see winter bad time me, I really money buy bread with. So I first sold silver buttons Sunday coat, I sold silver chain, I sold big pipe, last I sold wheelbarrow. But I going buy back now.’ “‘Hans,’ said Miller, ‘I give wheelbarrow. It good repair; indeed, one side gone, something wrong wheel-spokes; spite I give you. I know generous me, great many people would think extremely foolish parting it, I like rest world. I think generosity essence friendship, and, besides, I got new wheelbarrow myself. Yes, may set mind ease, I give wheelbarrow.’ “‘Well, really, generous you,’ said little Hans, funny round face glowed pleasure. ‘I easily put repair, I plank wood house.’ “‘A plank wood!’ said Miller; ‘why, I want roof barn. There large hole it, corn get damp I stop up. How lucky mentioned it! It quite remarkable one good action always breeds another. I given wheelbarrow, going give plank. Of course, wheelbarrow worth far plank, true, friendship never notices things like that. Pray get once, I set work barn day.’ “‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ran would dragged plank out. “‘It big plank,’ said Miller, looking it, ‘and I afraid I mended barn-roof left mend wheelbarrow with; but, course, fault. And now, I given wheelbarrow, I sure would like give flowers return. Here basket, mind fill quite full.’ “‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, really big basket, knew filled would flowers left market anxious get silver buttons back. “‘Well, really,’ answered Miller, ‘as I given wheelbarrow, I think much ask flowers. I may wrong, I thought friendship, true friendship, quite free selfishness kind.’ “‘My dear friend, best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you welcome flowers garden. I would much sooner good opinion silver buttons, day’; ran plucked pretty primroses, filled Miller’s basket. “‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said Miller, went hill plank shoulder, big basket hand. “‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, began dig away quite merrily, pleased wheelbarrow. “The next day nailing honeysuckle porch, heard Miller’s voice calling road. So jumped ladder, ran garden, looked wall. “There Miller large sack flour back. “‘Dear little Hans,’ said Miller, ‘would mind carrying sack flour market?’ “‘Oh, I sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I really busy to-day. I got creepers nail up, flowers water, grass roll.’ “‘Well, really,’ said Miller, ‘I think that, considering I going give wheelbarrow, rather unfriendly refuse.’ “‘Oh, say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I would unfriendly whole world’; ran cap, trudged big sack shoulders. “It hot day, road terribly dusty, Hans reached sixth milestone tired sit rest. However, went bravely, last reached market. After waited time, sold sack flour good price, returned home once, afraid stopped late might meet robbers way. “‘It certainly hard day,’ said little Hans going bed, ‘but I glad I refuse Miller, best friend, and, besides, going give wheelbarrow.’ “Early next morning Miller came get money sack flour, little Hans tired still bed. “‘Upon word,’ said Miller, ‘you lazy. Really, considering I going give wheelbarrow, I think might work harder. Idleness great sin, I certainly like friends idle sluggish. You must mind speaking quite plainly you. Of course I dream I friend. But good friendship one cannot say exactly one means? Anybody say charming things try please flatter, true friend always says unpleasant things, mind giving pain. Indeed, really true friend prefers it, knows good.’ “‘I sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing eyes pulling night-cap, ‘but I tired I thought I would lie bed little time, listen birds singing. Do know I always work better hearing birds sing?’ “‘Well, I glad that,’ said Miller, clapping little Hans back, ‘for I want come mill soon dressed, mend barn-roof me.’ “Poor little Hans anxious go work garden, flowers watered two days, like refuse Miller, good friend him. “‘Do think would unfriendly I said I busy?’ inquired shy timid voice. “‘Well, really,’ answered Miller, ‘I think much ask you, considering I going give wheelbarrow; course refuse I go myself.’ “‘Oh! account,’ cried little Hans jumped bed, dressed himself, went barn. “He worked day long, till sunset, sunset Miller came see getting on. “‘Have mended hole roof yet, little Hans?’ cried Miller cheery voice. “‘It quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming ladder. “‘Ah!’ said Miller, ‘there work delightful work one others.’ “‘It certainly great privilege hear talk,’ answered little Hans, sitting down, wiping forehead, ‘a great privilege. But I afraid I shall never beautiful ideas have.’ “‘Oh! come you,’ said Miller, ‘but must take pains. At present practice friendship; day theory also.’ “‘Do really think I shall?’ asked little Hans. “‘I doubt it,’ answered Miller, ‘but mended roof, better go home rest, I want drive sheep mountain to-morrow.’ “Poor little Hans afraid say anything this, early next morning Miller brought sheep round cottage, Hans started mountain. It took whole day get back; returned tired went sleep chair, wake till broad daylight. “‘What delightful time I shall garden,’ said, went work once. “But somehow never able look flowers all, friend Miller always coming round sending long errands, getting help mill. Little Hans much distressed times, afraid flowers would think forgotten them, consoled reflection Miller best friend. ‘Besides,’ used say, ‘he going give wheelbarrow, act pure generosity.’ “So little Hans worked away Miller, Miller said kinds beautiful things friendship, Hans took note-book, used read night, good scholar. “Now happened one evening little Hans sitting fireside loud rap came door. It wild night, wind blowing roaring round house terribly first thought merely storm. But second rap came, third, louder others. “‘It poor traveller,’ said little Hans himself, ran door. “There stood Miller lantern one hand big stick other. “‘Dear little Hans,’ cried Miller, ‘I great trouble. My little boy fallen ladder hurt himself, I going Doctor. But lives far away, bad night, occurred would much better went instead me. You know I going give wheelbarrow, so, fair something return.’ “‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take quite compliment coming me, I start once. But must lend lantern, night dark I afraid I might fall ditch.’ “‘I sorry,’ answered Miller, ‘but new lantern, would great loss anything happened it.’ “‘Well, never mind, I without it,’ cried little Hans, took great fur coat, warm scarlet cap, tied muffler round throat, started off. “What dreadful storm was! The night black little Hans could hardly see, wind strong could scarcely stand. However, courageous, walking three hours, arrived Doctor’s house, knocked door. “‘Who there?’ cried Doctor, putting head bedroom window. “‘Little Hans, Doctor.’ “’What want, little Hans?’ “‘The Miller’s son fallen ladder, hurt himself, Miller wants come once.’ “‘All right!’ said Doctor; ordered horse, big boots, lantern, came downstairs, rode direction Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him. “But storm grew worse worse, rain fell torrents, little Hans could see going, keep horse. At last lost way, wandered moor, dangerous place, full deep holes, poor little Hans drowned. His body found next day goatherds, floating great pool water, brought back cottage. “Everybody went little Hans’ funeral, popular, Miller chief mourner. “‘As I best friend,’ said Miller, ‘it fair I best place’; walked head procession long black cloak, every wiped eyes big pocket-handkerchief. “‘Little Hans certainly great loss every one,’ said Blacksmith, funeral over, seated comfortably inn, drinking spiced wine eating sweet cakes. “‘A great loss rate,’ answered Miller; ‘why, I good given wheelbarrow, I really know it. It much way home, bad repair I could get anything I sold it. I certainly take care give away anything again. One always suffers generous.’” “Well?” said Water-rat, long pause. “Well, end,” said Linnet. “But became Miller?” asked Water-rat. “Oh! I really know,” replied Linnet; “and I sure I care.” “It quite evident sympathy nature,” said Water-rat. “I afraid quite see moral story,” remarked Linnet. “The what?” screamed Water-rat. “The moral.” “Do mean say story moral?” “Certainly,” said Linnet. “Well, really,” said Water-rat, angry manner, “I think told began. If done so, I certainly would listened you; fact, I said ‘Pooh,’ like critic. However, I say now”; shouted “Pooh” top voice, gave whisk tail, went back hole. “And like Water-rat?” asked Duck, came paddling minutes afterwards. “He great many good points, part I mother’s feelings, I never look confirmed bachelor without tears coming eyes.” “I rather afraid I annoyed him,” answered Linnet. “The fact is, I told story moral.” “Ah! always dangerous thing do,” said Duck. And I quite agree her. The Remarkable Rocket. THE King’s son going married, general rejoicings. He waited whole year bride, last arrived. She Russian Princess, driven way Finland sledge drawn six reindeer. The sledge shaped like great golden swan, swan’s wings lay little Princess herself. Her long ermine-cloak reached right feet, head tiny cap silver tissue, pale Snow Palace always lived. So pale drove streets people wondered. “She like white rose!” cried, threw flowers balconies. At gate Castle Prince waiting receive her. He dreamy violet eyes, hair like fine gold. When saw sank upon one knee, kissed hand. “Your picture beautiful,” murmured, “but beautiful picture”; little Princess blushed. “She like white rose before,” said young Page neighbour, “but like red rose now”; whole Court delighted. For next three days everybody went saying, “White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose”; King gave orders Page’s salary doubled. As received salary much use him, considered great honour, duly published Court Gazette. When three days marriage celebrated. It magnificent ceremony, bride bridegroom walked hand hand canopy purple velvet embroidered little pearls. Then State Banquet, lasted five hours. The Prince Princess sat top Great Hall drank cup clear crystal. Only true lovers could drink cup, false lips touched it, grew grey dull cloudy. “It quite clear love other,” said little Page, “as clear crystal!” King doubled salary second time. “What honour!” cried courtiers. After banquet Ball. The bride bridegroom dance Rose-dance together, King promised play flute. He played badly, one ever dared tell so, King. Indeed, knew two airs, never quite certain one playing; made matter, for, whatever did, everybody cried out, “Charming! charming!” The last item programme grand display fireworks, let exactly midnight. The little Princess never seen firework life, King given orders Royal Pyrotechnist attendance day marriage. “What fireworks like?” asked Prince, one morning, walking terrace. “They like Aurora Borealis,” said King, always answered questions addressed people, “only much natural. I prefer stars myself, always know going appear, delightful flute-playing. You must certainly see them.” So end King’s garden great stand set up, soon Royal Pyrotechnist put everything proper place, fireworks began talk other. “The world certainly beautiful,” cried little Squib. “Just look yellow tulips. Why! real crackers could lovelier. I glad I travelled. Travel improves mind wonderfully, away one’s prejudices.” “The King’s garden world, foolish squib,” said big Roman Candle; “the world enormous place, would take three days see thoroughly.” “Any place love world you,” exclaimed pensive Catherine Wheel, attached old deal box early life, prided broken heart; “but love fashionable more, poets killed it. They wrote much nobody believed them, I surprised. True love suffers, silent. I remember once—But matter now. Romance thing past.” “Nonsense!” said Roman Candle, “Romance never dies. It like moon, lives ever. The bride bridegroom, instance, love dearly. I heard morning brown-paper cartridge, happened staying drawer myself, knew latest Court news.” But Catherine Wheel shook head. “Romance dead, Romance dead, Romance dead,” murmured. She one people think that, say thing great many times, becomes true end. Suddenly, sharp, dry cough heard, looked round. It came tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, tied end long stick. He always coughed made observation, attract attention. “Ahem! ahem!” said, everybody listened except poor Catherine Wheel, still shaking head, murmuring, “Romance dead.” “Order! order!” cried Cracker. He something politician, always taken prominent part local elections, knew proper Parliamentary expressions use. “Quite dead,” whispered Catherine Wheel, went sleep. As soon perfect silence, Rocket coughed third time began. He spoke slow, distinct voice, dictating memoirs, always looked shoulder person talking. In fact, distinguished manner. “How fortunate King’s son,” remarked, “that married day I let off. Really, arranged beforehand, could turned better him; but, Princes always lucky.” “Dear me!” said little Squib, “I thought quite way, let Prince’s honour.” “It may you,” answered; “indeed, I doubt is, different. I remarkable Rocket, come remarkable parents. My mother celebrated Catherine Wheel day, renowned graceful dancing. When made great public appearance spun round nineteen times went out, time threw air seven pink stars. She three feet half diameter, made best gunpowder. My father Rocket like myself, French extraction. He flew high people afraid would never come again. He did, though, kindly disposition, made brilliant descent shower golden rain. The newspapers wrote performance flattering terms. Indeed, Court Gazette called triumph Pylotechnic art.” “Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, mean,” said Bengal Light; “I know Pyrotechnic, I saw written canister.” “Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered Rocket, severe tone voice, Bengal Light felt crushed began bully little squibs, order show still person importance. “I saying,” continued Rocket, “I saying—What I saying?” “You talking yourself,” replied Roman Candle. “Of course; I knew I discussing interesting subject I rudely interrupted. I hate rudeness bad manners every kind, I extremely sensitive. No one whole world sensitive I am, I quite sure that.” “What sensitive person?” said Cracker Roman Candle. “A person who, corns himself, always treads people’s toes,” answered Roman Candle low whisper; Cracker nearly exploded laughter. “Pray, laughing at?” inquired Rocket; “I laughing.” “I laughing I happy,” replied Cracker. “That selfish reason,” said Rocket angrily. “What right happy? You thinking others. In fact, thinking me. I always thinking myself, I expect everybody else same. That called sympathy. It beautiful virtue, I possess high degree. Suppose, instance, anything happened to-night, misfortune would every one! The Prince Princess would never happy again, whole married life would spoiled; King, I know would get it. Really, I begin reflect importance position, I almost moved tears.” “If want give pleasure others,” cried Roman Candle, “you better keep dry.” “Certainly,” exclaimed Bengal Light, better spirits; “that common sense.” “Common sense, indeed!” said Rocket indignantly; “you forget I uncommon, remarkable. Why, anybody common sense, provided imagination. But I imagination, I never think things really are; I always think quite different. As keeping dry, evidently one appreciate emotional nature. Fortunately myself, I care. The thing sustains one life consciousness immense inferiority everybody else, feeling I always cultivated. But none hearts. Here laughing making merry Prince Princess married.” “Well, really,” exclaimed small Fire-balloon, “why not? It joyful occasion, I soar air I intend tell stars it. You see twinkle I talk pretty bride.” “Ah! trivial view life!” said Rocket; “but I expected. There nothing you; hollow empty. Why, perhaps Prince Princess may go live country deep river, perhaps may one son, little fair-haired boy violet eyes like Prince himself; perhaps day may go walk nurse; perhaps nurse may go sleep great elder-tree; perhaps little boy may fall deep river drowned. What terrible misfortune! Poor people, lose son! It really dreadful! I shall never get it.” “But lost son,” said Roman Candle; “no misfortune happened all.” “I never said had,” replied Rocket; “I said might. If lost son would use saying anything matter. I hate people cry spilt milk. But I think might lose son, I certainly much affected.” “You certainly are!” cried Bengal Light. “In fact, affected person I ever met.” “You rudest person I ever met,” said Rocket, “and cannot understand friendship Prince.” “Why, even know him,” growled Roman Candle. “I never said I knew him,” answered Rocket. “I dare say I knew I friend all. It dangerous thing know one’s friends.” “You really better keep dry,” said Fire-balloon. “That important thing.” “Very important you, I doubt,” answered Rocket, “but I shall weep I choose”; actually burst real tears, flowed stick like rain-drops, nearly drowned two little beetles, thinking setting house together, looking nice dry spot live in. “He must truly romantic nature,” said Catherine Wheel, “for weeps nothing weep about”; heaved deep sigh, thought deal box. But Roman Candle Bengal Light quite indignant, kept saying, “Humbug! humbug!” top voices. They extremely practical, whenever objected anything called humbug. Then moon rose like wonderful silver shield; stars began shine, sound music came palace. The Prince Princess leading dance. They danced beautifully tall white lilies peeped window watched them, great red poppies nodded heads beat time. Then ten clock struck, eleven, twelve, last stroke midnight every one came terrace, King sent Royal Pyrotechnist. “Let fireworks begin,” said King; Royal Pyrotechnist made low bow, marched end garden. He six attendants him, carried lighted torch end long pole. It certainly magnificent display. Whizz! Whizz! went Catherine Wheel, spun round round. Boom! Boom! went Roman Candle. Then Squibs danced place, Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet. “Good-bye,” cried Fire-balloon, soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks. Bang! Bang! answered Crackers, enjoying immensely. Every one great success except Remarkable Rocket. He damp crying could go all. The best thing gunpowder, wet tears use. All poor relations, would never speak, except sneer, shot sky like wonderful golden flowers blossoms fire. Huzza! Huzza! cried Court; little Princess laughed pleasure. “I suppose reserving grand occasion,” said Rocket; “no doubt means,” looked supercilious ever. The next day workmen came put everything tidy. “This evidently deputation,” said Rocket; “I receive becoming dignity” put nose air, began frown severely thinking important subject. But took notice till going away. Then one caught sight him. “Hallo!” cried, “what bad rocket!” threw wall ditch. “BAD Rocket? BAD Rocket?” said, whirled air; “impossible! GRAND Rocket, man said. BAD GRAND sound much same, indeed often same”; fell mud. “It comfortable here,” remarked, “but doubt fashionable watering-place, sent away recruit health. My nerves certainly much shattered, I require rest.” Then little Frog, bright jewelled eyes, green mottled coat, swam him. “A new arrival, I see!” said Frog. “Well, nothing like mud. Give rainy weather ditch, I quite happy. Do think wet afternoon? I sure I hope so, sky quite blue cloudless. What pity!” “Ahem! ahem!” said Rocket, began cough. “What delightful voice have!” cried Frog. “Really quite like croak, croaking course musical sound world. You hear glee-club evening. We sit old duck pond close farmer’s house, soon moon rises begin. It entrancing everybody lies awake listen us. In fact, yesterday I heard farmer’s wife say mother could get wink sleep night account us. It gratifying find oneself popular.” “Ahem! ahem!” said Rocket angrily. He much annoyed could get word in. “A delightful voice, certainly,” continued Frog; “I hope come duck-pond. I look daughters. I six beautiful daughters, I afraid Pike may meet them. He perfect monster, would hesitation breakfasting them. Well, good-bye: I enjoyed conversation much, I assure you.” “Conversation, indeed!” said Rocket. “You talked whole time yourself. That conversation.” “Somebody must listen,” answered Frog, “and I like talking myself. It saves time, prevents arguments.” “But I like arguments,” said Rocket. “I hope not,” said Frog complacently. “Arguments extremely vulgar, everybody good society holds exactly opinions. Good-bye second time; I see daughters distance:” little Frog swam away. “You irritating person,” said Rocket, “and ill-bred. I hate people talk themselves, do, one wants talk oneself, I do. It I call selfishness, selfishness detestable thing, especially one temperament, I well known sympathetic nature. In fact, take example me; could possibly better model. Now chance better avail it, I going back Court almost immediately. I great favourite Court; fact, Prince Princess married yesterday honour. Of course know nothing matters, provincial.” “There good talking him,” said Dragon-fly, sitting top large brown bulrush; “no good all, gone away.” “Well, loss, mine,” answered Rocket. “I going stop talking merely pays attention. I like hearing talk. It one greatest pleasures. I often long conversations myself, I clever sometimes I understand single word I saying.” “Then certainly lecture Philosophy,” said Dragon-fly; spread pair lovely gauze wings soared away sky. “How silly stay here!” said Rocket. “I sure often got chance improving mind. However, I care bit. Genius like mine sure appreciated day”; sank little deeper mud. After time large White Duck swam him. She yellow legs, webbed feet, considered great beauty account waddle. “Quack, quack, quack,” said. “What curious shape are! May I ask born like that, result accident?” “It quite evident always lived country,” answered Rocket, “otherwise would know I am. However, I excuse ignorance. It would unfair expect people remarkable oneself. You doubt surprised hear I fly sky, come shower golden rain.” “I think much that,” said Duck, “as I cannot see use one. Now, could plough fields like ox, draw cart like horse, look sheep like collie-dog, would something.” “My good creature,” cried Rocket haughty tone voice, “I see belong lower orders. A person position never useful. We certain accomplishments, sufficient. I sympathy industry kind, least industries seem recommend. Indeed, I always opinion hard work simply refuge people nothing whatever do.” “Well, well,” said Duck, peaceable disposition, never quarrelled one, “everybody different tastes. I hope, rate, going take residence here.” “Oh! dear no,” cried Rocket. “I merely visitor, distinguished visitor. The fact I find place rather tedious. There neither society here, solitude. In fact, essentially suburban. I shall probably go back Court, I know I destined make sensation world.” “I thoughts entering public life myself,” remarked Duck; “there many things need reforming. Indeed, I took chair meeting time ago, passed resolutions condemning everything like. However, seem much effect. Now I go domesticity, look family.” “I made public life,” said Rocket, “and relations, even humblest them. Whenever appear excite great attention. I actually appeared myself, I magnificent sight. As domesticity, ages one rapidly, distracts one’s mind higher things.” “Ah! higher things life, fine are!” said Duck; “and reminds hungry I feel”: swam away stream, saying, “Quack, quack, quack.” “Come back! come back!” screamed Rocket, “I great deal say you”; Duck paid attention him. “I glad gone,” said himself, “she decidedly middle-class mind”; sank little deeper still mud, began think loneliness genius, suddenly two little boys white smocks came running bank, kettle faggots. “This must deputation,” said Rocket, tried look dignified. “Hallo!” cried one boys, “look old stick! I wonder came here”; picked rocket ditch. “OLD Stick!” said Rocket, “impossible! GOLD Stick, said. Gold Stick complimentary. In fact, mistakes one Court dignitaries!” “Let us put fire!” said boy, “it help boil kettle.” So piled faggots together, put Rocket top, lit fire. “This magnificent,” cried Rocket, “they going let broad day-light, every one see me.” “We go sleep now,” said, “and wake kettle boiled”; lay grass, shut eyes. The Rocket damp, took long time burn. At last, however, fire caught him. “Now I going off!” cried, made stiff straight. “I know I shall go much higher stars, much higher moon, much higher sun. In fact, I shall go high that—” Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! went straight air. “Delightful!” cried, “I shall go like ever. What success I am!” But nobody saw him. Then began feel curious tingling sensation him. “Now I going explode,” cried. “I shall set whole world fire, make noise nobody talk anything else whole year.” And certainly explode. Bang! Bang! Bang! went gunpowder. There doubt it. But nobody heard him, even two little boys, sound asleep. Then left stick, fell back Goose taking walk side ditch. “Good heavens!” cried Goose. “It going rain sticks”; rushed water. “I knew I create great sensation,” gasped Rocket, went out.
