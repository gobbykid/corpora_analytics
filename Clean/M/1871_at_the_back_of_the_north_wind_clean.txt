 AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND CHAPTER I. THE HAY-LOFT I HAVE asked tell back north wind. An old Greek writer mentions people lived there, comfortable could bear longer, drowned themselves. My story his. I think Herodotus got right account place. I going tell fared boy went there. He lived low room coach-house; means back north wind, mother well knew. For one side room built boards, boards old might run penknife north wind. And let settle sharper! I know pulled wind would like cat mouse, would know soon enough back north wind. Still, room cold, except north wind blew stronger usual: room I always cold, except summer, sun took matter hands. Indeed, I sure whether I ought call room all; loft kept hay straw oats horses. And little Diamond--but stop: I must tell father, coachman, named favourite horse, mother objection:--when little Diamond, then, lay bed, could hear horses munching away dark, moving sleepily dreams. For Diamond's father built bed loft boards round it, little room end coach-house; Diamond's father put old Diamond stall bed, quiet horse, go sleep standing, lay like reasonable creature. But, although surprisingly reasonable creature, yet, young Diamond woke middle night, felt bed shaking blasts north wind, could help wondering whether, wind blow house down, fall manger, old Diamond might eat knew night-gown. And although old Diamond quiet night long, yet woke got like earthquake, young Diamond knew clock was, least done next, was--to go sleep fast could. There hay feet hay head, piled great trusses roof. Indeed sometimes little lane several turnings, looked sawn him, could reach bed all. For stock hay was, course, always state either slow ebb sudden flow. Sometimes whole space loft, little panes roof stars look in, would lie open open eyes lay bed; sometimes yellow wall sweet-smelling fibres closed view distance half yard. Sometimes, mother undressed room, told trot bed himself, would creep heart hay, lie thinking cold outside wind, warm inside bed, could go pleased, would yet; would get little colder first. And ever grew colder, bed would grow warmer, till last would scramble hay, shoot like arrow bed, cover up, snuggle down, thinking happy boy was. He least idea wind got chink wall, blew night. For back bed boards inch thick, side north wind. Now, I already said, boards soft crumbly. To sure, tarred outside, yet many places like tinder timber. Hence happened soft part worn away it, little Diamond found one night, lay down, knot come one them, wind blowing upon cold rather imperious fashion. Now fancy leaving things wrong might set right; jumped bed again, got little strike hay, twisted up, folded middle, and, thus made cork, stuck hole wall. But wind began blow loud angrily, and, Diamond falling asleep, blew cork hit nose, hard enough wake quite, let hear wind whistling shrill hole. He searched hay-cork, found it, stuck harder, dropping more, when, pop! angry whistle behind it, cork struck again, time cheek. Up rose more, made fresh stopple hay, corked hole severely. But hardly before--pop! came forehead. He gave up, drew clothes head, soon fast asleep. Although next day stormy, Diamond forgot hole, busy making cave side mother's fire broken chair, three-legged stool, blanket, sitting it. His mother, however, discovered it, pasted bit brown paper it, that, Diamond snuggled next night, occasion think it. Presently, however, lifted head listened. Who could talking him? The wind rising again, getting loud, full rushes whistles. He sure one talking--and near him, too, was. But frightened, yet learned be; sat hearkened. At last voice, which, though quite gentle, sounded little angry, appeared come back bed. He crept nearer it, laid ear wall. Then heard nothing wind, sounded loud indeed. The moment, however, moved head wall, heard voice again, close ear. He felt hand, came upon piece paper mother pasted hole. Against laid ear, heard voice quite distinctly. There was, fact, little corner paper loose, that, mouth wall, voice came. “What mean, little boy--closing window?” “What window?” asked Diamond. “You stuffed hay three times last night. I blow three times.” “You cannot mean little hole! It window; hole bed.” “I say window: I said window.” “But cannot window, windows holes see of.” “Well, I made window for.” “But outside: cannot want window.” “You quite mistaken. Windows see of, say. Well, I house, I want windows see it.” “But made window bed.” “Well, mother got three windows dancing room, three garret.” “But I heard father say, mother wanted make window wall, law, would look Mr. Dyves's garden.” The voice laughed. “The law would trouble catch me!” said. “But right, know,” said Diamond, “that matter. You it.” “I tall I law,” said voice. “You must tall house, then,” said Diamond. “Yes; tall house: clouds inside it.” “Dear me!” said Diamond, thought minute. “I think, then, hardly expect keep window bed you. Why make window Mr. Dyves's bed?” “Nobody makes window ash-pit,” said voice, rather sadly. “I like see nice things windows.” “But must nicer bed I have, though mine nice--so nice I could wish better.” “It bed I care about: it.--But open window.” “Well, mother says I disobliging; rather hard. You see north wind blow right face I do.” “I North Wind.” “O-o-oh!” said Diamond, thoughtfully. “Then promise blow face I open window?” “I cannot promise that.” “But give toothache. Mother's got already.” “But become without window?” “I sure I know. All I say is, worse you.” “No; not. You shall worse it--I promise that. You much better it. Just believe I say, I tell you.” “Well, I pull clothes head,” said Diamond, feeling little sharp nails, got hold open edge paper tore once. In came long whistling spear cold, struck little naked chest. He scrambled tumbled bedclothes, covered up: paper voice, felt little--not frightened exactly--I told learned yet--but rather queer; strange person North Wind must lived great house--“called Out-of-Doors, I suppose,” thought Diamond--and made windows people's beds! But voice began again; could hear quite plainly, even head bed-clothes. It still gentle voice now, although six times large loud been, thought sounded little like mother's. “What name, little boy?” asked. “Diamond,” answered Diamond, bed-clothes. “What funny name!” “It nice name,” returned owner. “I know that,” said voice. “Well, I do,” retorted Diamond, little rudely. “Do know speaking!” “No,” said Diamond. And indeed not. For know person's name always know person's self. “Then I must angry you.--You better look see, though.” “Diamond pretty name,” persisted boy, vexed give satisfaction. “Diamond useless thing rather,” said voice. “That true. Diamond nice--as big two--and quiet night! And make jolly row morning, getting upon four great legs! It like thunder.” “You seem know diamond is.” “Oh, I just! Diamond great good horse; sleeps right me. He old Diamond, I young Diamond; or, like better, particular, Mr. North Wind, big Diamond, I little Diamond; I know us father likes best.” A beautiful laugh, large soft musical, sounded somewhere beside him, Diamond kept head clothes. “I Mr. North Wind,” said voice. “You told North Wind,” insisted Diamond. “I say Mister North Wind,” said voice. “Well, then, I do; mother tells I ought polite.” “Then let tell I think polite say Mister me.” “Well, I know better. I sorry.” “But ought know better.” “I know that.” “I do. You cannot say polite lie talking--with head bed-clothes, never look see kind person talking to.--I want come me.” “I want go sleep,” said Diamond, nearly crying, like scolded, even deserved it. “You shall sleep better to-morrow night.” “Besides,” said Diamond, “you Mr. Dyves's garden, I cannot get there. I get yard.” “Will take head bed-clothes?” said voice, little angrily. “No!” answered Diamond, half peevish, half frightened. The instant said word, tremendous blast wind crashed board wall, swept clothes Diamond. He started terror. Leaning large, beautiful, pale face woman. Her dark eyes looked little angry, begun flash; quivering sweet upper lip made look going cry. What strange away head streamed black hair every direction, darkness hay-loft looked made hair Diamond gazed speechless amazement, mingled confidence--for boy entranced mighty beauty--her hair began gather darkness, fell again, till face looked midst like moon cloud. From eyes came light Diamond saw face hair; see yet. The wind gone. “Will go now, little Diamond? I sorry I forced rough you,” said lady. “I will; yes, I will,” answered Diamond, holding arms. “But,” added, dropping them, “how shall I get clothes? They mother's room, door locked.” “Oh, never mind clothes. You cold. I shall take care that. Nobody cold north wind.” “I thought everybody was,” said Diamond. “That great mistake. Most people make it, however. They cold north wind, without it.” If Diamond little older, supposed good deal wiser, would thought lady joking. But older, fancy wiser, therefore understood well enough. Again stretched arms. The lady's face drew back little. “Follow me, Diamond,” said. “Yes,” said Diamond, little ruefully. “You afraid?” said North Wind. “No, madam; mother never would let go without shoes: never said anything clothes, I dare say would mind that.” “I know mother well,” said lady. “She good woman. I visited often. I born. I saw laugh cry once. I love mother, Diamond.” “How know name, then, madam? Please I say madam you, madam?” “One question time, dear boy. I knew name quite well, I wanted hear would say it. Do remember day man finding fault name--how I blew window in?” “Yes, yes,” answered Diamond, eagerly. “Our window opens like door, right coach-house door. And wind--you, madam--came in, blew Bible man's hands, leaves went flutter, flutter floor, mother picked gave back open, there----” “Was name Bible--the sixth stone high priest's breastplate.” “Oh!--a stone, it?” said Diamond. “I thought horse--I did.” “Never mind. A horse better stone day. Well, see, I know mother.” “Yes. I go you.” “Now next question: call madam. You must call name--respectfully, know--just North Wind.” “Well, please, North Wind, beautiful, I quite ready go you.” “You must ready go everything beautiful once, Diamond.” “But beautiful cannot bad. You bad, North Wind?” “No; I bad. But sometimes beautiful things grow bad bad, takes time badness spoil beauty. So little boys may mistaken go things beautiful.” “Well, I go beautiful good, too.” “Ah, another thing, Diamond:--What I look ugly without bad--look ugly I making ugly things beautiful?--What then?” “I quite understand you, North Wind. You tell then.” “Well, I tell you. If see face black, frightened. If see flapping wings like bat's, big whole sky, frightened. If hear raging ten times worse Mrs. Bill, blacksmith's wife--even see looking people's windows like Mrs. Eve Dropper, gardener's wife--you must believe I work. Nay, Diamond, I change serpent tiger, must let go hold me, hand never change keep good hold. If keep hold, know I time, even look cannot see least like North Wind. I may look something awful. Do understand?” “Quite well,” said little Diamond. “Come along, then,” said North Wind, disappeared behind mountain hay. Diamond crept bed followed her. CHAPTER II. THE LAWN WHEN Diamond got round corner hay, moment hesitated. The stair would naturally gone door side loft, looked black indeed; full North Wind's hair, descended him. And beside ladder going straight stable, father always came fetch hay Diamond's dinner. Through opening floor faint gleam the-stable lantern enticing, Diamond thought would run way. The stair went close past loose-box Diamond horse lived. When Diamond boy half-way down, remembered use go way, stable-door locked. But moment horse Diamond's great head poked box ladder, knew boy Diamond although night-gown, wanted pull ears him. This Diamond gently minute so, patted stroked neck too, kissed big horse, begun take bits straw hay mane, recollected Lady North Wind waiting yard. “Good night, Diamond,” said, darted ladder, across loft, stair door. But got yard, lady. Now always dreadful thing think somebody find nobody. Children particular made minds it; generally cry nobody, especially wake night. But especial disappointment Diamond, little heart beating joy: face North Wind grand! To lady like friend--with long hair, too! Why, longer twenty Diamonds' tails! She gone. And stood, bare feet stones paved yard. It clear night overhead, stars shining. Orion particular making bright belt golden sword. But moon poor thin crescent. There one great, jagged, black gray cloud sky, steep side like precipice; moon side, looked tumbled top cloud-hill, broken rolling precipice. She seem comfortable, looking deep pit waiting her. At least Diamond thought stood moment staring her. But quite wrong, moon afraid, pit going into, sides it, pit without sides pit all. Diamond, however, late life, things looked strange him!--just got Fairyland, knew quite much anybody; mother money buy books set wrong subject. I seen world--only sometimes, then, know--look strange ever I saw Fairyland. But I confess I yet seen Fairyland best. I always going see time. But face back North Wind, cold rather frosty night, night-gown, would felt quite strange Diamond did. He cried little, little, disappointed lose lady: course, you, little man, would done that! But part, I mind people crying much I mind cry about, cry--whether cry quietly like ladies gentlemen, go shrieking like vulgar emperors, ill-natured cooks; emperors gentlemen, cooks ladies--nor queens princesses matter, either. But cannot denied little gentle crying one good. It Diamond good; soon brave boy again. “She shall say fault, anyhow!” said Diamond. “I daresay hiding somewhere see I do. I look her.” So went round end stable towards kitchen-garden. But moment clear shelter stable, sharp knife came wind little chest bare legs. Still would look kitchen-garden, went on. But got round weeping-ash stood corner, wind blew much stronger, grew stronger stronger till could hardly fight it. And cold! All flashy spikes stars seemed got somehow wind. Then thought lady said people cold North Wind. How guessed meant moment I cannot tell, I observed wonderful thing world people come understand anything. He turned back wind, trotted towards yard; whereupon, strange say, blew much gently calves blown shins began feel almost warm contrast. You must think cowardly Diamond turn back wind: thought Lady North Wind said something like telling so. If said must hold face it, Diamond would held face it. But foolish thing fight good, please nobody. Well, wind pushing Diamond along. If turned round, grew sharp legs especially, thought wind might really Lady North Wind, though could see her, better let blow wherever pleased. So blew blew, went went, found standing door wall, door led yard little belt shrubbery, flanking Mr. Coleman's house. Mr. Coleman father's master, owner Diamond. He opened door, went shrubbery, middle lawn, still hoping find North Wind. The soft grass pleasant bare feet, felt warm stones yard; lady nowhere seen. Then began think must done wrong, offended following close her, staying talk horse, certainly neither wise polite. There stood middle lawn, wind blowing night-gown till flapped like loose sail. The stars shiny head; give light enough show grass green; Diamond stood alone strange night, looked half solid him. He began wonder whether dream not. It important determine this; “for,” thought Diamond, “if I dream, I safe bed, I need cry. But I dream, I here, perhaps I better cry, or, least, I sure whether I help it.” He came conclusion, however, that, whether dream not, could harm crying little longer: could begin whenever liked. The back Mr. Coleman's house lawn, one drawing-room windows looked upon it. The ladies gone bed; light still shining window. But idea little boy standing lawn night-gown, would run moment. And long saw light, Diamond could feel quite lonely. He stood staring, great warrior Orion sky, yet disconsolate, neglected moon going west, drawing-room window light shining green curtains. He room twice could remember Christmas times; Colemans kind people, though care much children. All light went nearly out: could see glimmer shape window. Then, indeed, felt left alone. It dreadful night everybody gone bed! That could bear. He burst crying good earnest, beginning wail like wind waking up. Perhaps think foolish; could go home bed liked? Yes; looked dreadful creep stair lie bed again, know North Wind's window open beside him, gone, might never see again. He would lonely here. Nay, would much worse think window nothing hole wall. At moment burst crying, old nurse grown one family, gone away Miss Coleman want nursing, came back door, glass, close shutters. She thought heard cry, and, peering hand side eyes like Diamond's blinkers, saw something white lawn. Too old wise frightened, opened door, went straight towards white thing see was. And Diamond saw coming frightened either, though Mrs. Crump little cross sometimes; good kind crossness disagreeable, bad kind crossness nasty indeed. So came neck stretched out, head end it, eyes foremost all, like snail's, peering night see could went glimmering white her. When see, made great exclamation, threw hands. Then without word, thought Diamond walking sleep, caught hold him, led towards house. He made objection, mood grateful notice sort, Mrs. Crump led straight drawing-room. Now, neglect new housemaid, fire Miss Coleman's bedroom gone out, mother told brush hair drawing-room fire--a disorderly proceeding mother's wish could justify. The young lady lovely, though nearly beautiful North Wind; hair extremely long, came knees--though nothing North Wind's hair. Yet looked round, hair her, Diamond entered, thought one moment North Wind, and, pulling hand Mrs. Crump's, stretched arms ran towards Miss Coleman. She pleased threw brush, almost knelt floor receive arms. He saw next moment Lady North Wind, looked like could help running arms bursting tears afresh. Mrs. Crump said poor child walked sleep, Diamond thought ought know, contradict anything knew, might indeed. He let talk him, said nothing; when, astonishment over, Miss Coleman given sponge-cake, decreed Mrs. Crump take mother, quite satisfied. His mother get bed open door Mrs. Crump knocked. She indeed surprised see her, boy; taken arms carried bed, returned long confabulation Mrs. Crump, still talking Diamond fell fast asleep, could hear longer. CHAPTER III. OLD DIAMOND DIAMOND woke early morning, thought curious dream had. But memory grew brighter brighter head, look altogether like dream, began doubt whether really abroad wind last night. He came conclusion that, really brought home mother Mrs. Crump, would say something it, would settle matter. Then got dressed himself, but, finding father mother yet stirring, went ladder stable. There found even old Diamond awake yet, he, well young Diamond, always got moment woke, lying flat horse could lie upon nice trim bed straw. “I give old Diamond surprise,” thought boy; creeping softly, horse knew, astride back. Then young Diamond's turn surprise expected; earthquake, rumbling rocking hither thither, sprawling legs heaving many backs, young Diamond found hoisted air, hands twisted horse's mane. The next instant old Diamond lashed hind legs, giving one cry terror young Diamond found lying neck, arms far round would go. But horse stood still stone, except lifted head gently let boy slip back. For heard young Diamond's cry knew nothing kick about; young Diamond good boy, old Diamond good horse, one right back other. As soon Diamond got comfortable saddle place, horse began pulling hay, boy began thinking. He never mounted Diamond before, never got without lifted down. So sat, horse ate, wondering reach ground. But meditated, mother woke, first thought see boy. She visited twice night, found sleeping quietly. Now bed empty, frightened. “Diamond! Diamond! Where you, Diamond?” called out. Diamond turned head sat like knight steed enchanted stall, cried aloud,-- “Here, mother!” “Where, Diamond?” returned. “Here, mother, Diamond's back.” She came running ladder, peeping down, saw aloft great horse. “Come down, Diamond,” said. “I cannot,” answered Diamond. “How get up?” asked mother. “Quite easily,” answered he; “but I got up, Diamond would get too, I am.” His mother thought walking sleep again, hurried ladder. She much like going horse, used horses; would gone lion's den, say horse's stall, help boy. So went lifted Diamond's back, felt braver life after. She carried arms room; but, afraid frightening sleep-walking, supposed it, said nothing last night. Before next day over, Diamond almost concluded whole adventure dream. For week mother watched carefully--going loft several times night--as often, fact, woke. Every time found fast asleep. All week hard weather. The grass showed white morning hoar-frost clung like tiny comfits every blade. And Diamond's shoes good, mother quite saved enough money get new pair much wanted him, would let run out. He played games indoors, especially driving two chairs harnessed baby's cradle; go fast, went fast could expected best chairs world, although one three legs, half back. At length mother brought home new shoes, sooner find fitted told might run yard amuse hour. The sun going flew door like bird cage. All world new him. A great fire sunset burned top gate led stables house; fire sky lay large lake green light, golden cloud, blue wintry heavens. And Diamond thought that, next home, never seen place would like much live sky. For fine things make home nice place, mother father. As looking lovely colours, gates thrown open, old Diamond friend carriage, dancing impatience get stalls oats. And came. Diamond least afraid father driving him, but, careful spoil grand show made fine horses multitudinous cape, red edge every fold, slipped way let dash right stables. To quite safe step recess door led yard shrubbery. As stood remembered wind driven spot night dream. And almost sure dream. At events, would go see whether things looked then. He opened door, passed little belt shrubbery. Not flower seen beds lawn. Even brave old chrysanthemums Christmas roses passed away frost. What? Yes! There one! He ran knelt look it. It primrose--a dwarfish thing, perfect shape--a baby-wonder. As stooped face see close, little wind began blow, two three long leaves stood behind flower shook waved quivered, primrose lay still green hollow, looking sky, seeming know wind blowing all. It one eye dull black wintry earth opened look sky with. All Diamond thought saying prayers, ought staring so. He ran stable see father make Diamond's bed. Then father took arms, carried ladder, set table going tea. “Miss poorly,” said Diamond's father. “Mis'ess doctor to-day, looked glum came again. I a-watching see doctor said.” “And Miss look glum too?” asked mother. “Not half glum Mis'ess,” returned coachman. “You see--” But lowered voice, Diamond could make word there. For Diamond's father one finest coachmen look at, one best drivers, one discreet servants well. Therefore talk family affairs one wife, proved better long ago, careful even Diamond hear nothing could repeat concerning master family. It bed-time soon, Diamond went bed fell fast asleep. He awoke once, dark. “Open window, Diamond,” said voice. Now Diamond's mother pasted North Wind's window. “Are North Wind?” said Diamond: “I hear blowing.” “No; hear talking. Open window, I overmuch time.” “Yes,” returned Diamond. “But, please, North Wind, use? You left alone last time.” He got knees, busy nails paper hole wall. For North Wind spoke again, remembered taken place distinctly happened last night. “Yes, fault,” returned North Wind. “I work do; and, besides, gentleman never keep lady waiting.” “But I gentleman,” said Diamond, scratching away paper. “I hope say ten years this.” “I going coachman, coachman gentleman,” persisted Diamond. “We call father gentleman house,” said North Wind. “He call one,” said Diamond. “That consequence: every man ought gentleman, father one.” Diamond pleased hear scratched paper like ten mice, getting hold edge it, tore off. The next instant young girl glided across bed, stood upon floor. “Oh dear!” said Diamond, quite dismayed; “I know--who you, please?” “I North Wind.” “Are really?” “Yes. Make haste.” “But bigger me.” “Do think I care big little I am? Did see evening? I less then.” “No. Where you?” “Behind leaves primrose. Did see blowing?” “Yes.” “Make haste, then, want go me.” “But big enough take care me. I think Miss North Wind.” “I big enough show way, anyhow. But come, why, must stay.” “I must dress myself. I mind grown lady, I could go little girl night-gown.” “Very well. I hurry I night. Dress fast can, I go shake primrose leaves till come.” “Do hurt it,” said Diamond. North Wind broke little laugh like breaking silver bubbles, gone moment. Diamond saw--for starlit night, mass hay low ebb now--the gleam something vanishing stair, and, springing bed, dressed fast ever could. Then crept yard, door wall, away primrose. Behind stood North Wind, leaning it, looking flower mother. “Come along,” said, jumping holding hand. Diamond took hand. It cold, pleasant full life, better warm. She led across garden. With one bound top wall. Diamond left foot. “Stop, stop!” cried. “Please, I cannot jump like that.” “You try” said North Wind, top looked foot taller before. “Give hand again, I will, try” said Diamond. She reached down, Diamond laid hold hand, gave great spring, stood beside her. “This nice!” said. Another bound, stood road river. It full tide, stars shining clear depths, lay still, waiting turn run sea. They walked along side. But walked far surface covered ripples, stars vanished bosom. And North Wind tall full-grown girl. Her hair flying head, wind blowing breeze river. But turned aside went narrow lane, went hair fell around her. “I rather disagreeable work to-night,” said, “before I get sea, I must set once. The disagreeable work must looked first.” So saying, laid hold Diamond began run, gliding along faster faster. Diamond kept well could. She made many turnings windings, apparently quite easy get walls houses. Once ran hall found back front doors open. At foot stair North Wind stood still, Diamond, hearing great growl, started terror, there, instead North Wind, huge wolf side. He let go hold dismay, wolf bounded stair. The windows house rattled shook guns firing, sound great fall came above. Diamond stood white face staring landing. “Surely,” thought, “North Wind cannot eating one children!” Coming once, rushed little fist clenched. There ladies long trains going stairs, gentlemen white neckties attending them, stared him, none people house, said nothing. Before reached head stair, however, North Wind met him, took hand, hurried house. “I hope eaten baby, North Wind!” said Diamond, solemnly. North Wind laughed merrily, went tripping faster. Her grassy robe swept swirled steps, wherever passed withered leaves, went fleeing whirling spirals, running edges like wheels, feet. “No,” said last, “I eat baby. You would ask foolish question let go hold me. You would seen I served nurse calling child bad names, telling wicked. She drinking. I saw ugly gin bottle cupboard.” “And frightened her?” said Diamond. “I believe so!” answered North Wind laughing merrily. “I flew throat, tumbled floor crash ran in. She turned away to-morrow--and quite time, knew much I do.” “But frighten little one?” “She never saw me. The woman would seen either wicked.” “Oh!” said Diamond, dubiously. “Why see things,” returned North Wind, “that would understand know with? Good people see good things; bad people, bad things.” “Then bad thing?” “No. For see me, Diamond, dear,” said girl, looked him, Diamond saw loving eyes great lady beaming depths falling hair. “I make look like bad thing could see me. If I put shape wolf's would seen me, growing shape inside her.” “I know mean,” said Diamond, “but I suppose right.” They climbing slope grassy ascent. It Primrose Hill, fact, although Diamond never heard it. The moment reached top, North Wind stood turned face towards London The stars still shining clear cold overhead. There cloud seen. The air sharp, Diamond find cold. “Now,” said lady, “whatever do, let hand go. I might lost last time, I hurry then: I hurry.” Yet stood still moment. CHAPTER IV. NORTH WIND AND stood looking towards London, Diamond saw trembling. “Are cold, North Wind?” asked. “No, Diamond,” answered, looking upon smile; “I getting ready sweep one rooms. Those careless, greedy, untidy children make mess.” As spoke could told voice, seen eyes, growing larger larger. Her head went towards stars; grew, still trembling body, hair also grew--longer longer, lifted head, went black waves. The next moment, however, fell back around her, grew less less till tall woman. Then put hands behind head, gathered hair, began weaving knotting together. When done, bent beautiful face close his, said-- “Diamond, I afraid would keep hold me, I drop you, I know might happen; I making place hair. Come.” Diamond held arms, grand face looking him, believed like baby. She took hands, threw shoulder, said, “Get in, Diamond.” And Diamond parted hair hands, crept between, feeling soon found woven nest. It like pocket, like shawl gipsy women carry children. North Wind put hands back, felt nest, finding safe, said-- “Are comfortable, Diamond?” “Yes, indeed,” answered Diamond. The next moment rising air. North Wind grew towering place clouds. Her hair went streaming her, till spread like mist stars. She flung abroad space. Diamond held two twisted ropes which, parted interwoven, formed shelter, could help little afraid. As soon come himself, peeped woven meshes, dare look top nest. The earth rushing past like river sea him. Trees water green grass hurried away beneath. A great roar wild animals rose rushed Zoological Gardens, mixed chattering monkeys screaming birds; died away moment behind them. And nothing roofs houses, sweeping along like great torrent stones rocks. Chimney-pots fell, tiles flew roofs; looked left behind roofs chimneys scudded away. There great roaring, wind dashing London like sea; North Wind's back Diamond, course, felt nothing all. He perfect calm. He could hear sound it, all. By raised looked edge nest. There houses rushing shooting away him, like fierce torrent rocks instead water. Then looked sky, could see stars; hidden blinding masses lady's hair swept between. He began wonder whether would hear spoke. He would try. “Please, North Wind,” said, “what noise?” From high head came voice North Wind, answering him, gently-- “The noise besom. I old woman sweeps cobwebs sky; I busy floor now.” “What makes houses look running away?” “I sweeping fast them.” “But, please, North Wind, I knew London big, I know big this. It seems never get away it.” “We going round round, else left long ago.” “Is way sweep, North Wind?” “Yes; I go round round great besom.” “Please, would mind going little slower, I want see streets?” “You see much now.” “Why?” “Because I nearly swept people home.” “Oh! I forgot,” said Diamond, quiet that, want troublesome. But dropped little towards roofs houses, Diamond could see streets. There people about, though. The lamps flickered flared again, nobody seemed want them. Suddenly Diamond espied little girl coming along street. She dreadfully blown wind, broom trailing behind troublesome. It seemed wind spite her--it kept worrying like wild beast, tearing rags. She lonely there! “Oh! please, North Wind,” cried, “will help little girl?” “No, Diamond; I must leave work.” “But kind her?” “I kind her. I sweeping wicked smells away.” “But kinder me, dear North Wind. Why kind me?” “There reasons, Diamond. Everybody cannot done same. Everybody ready thing.” “But I see I kinder used she.” “Do think nothing's done see, Diamond, silly! It right. Of course help like. You got nothing particular moment; I have.” “Oh! let help her, then. But able wait, perhaps?” “No, I cannot wait; must yourself. And, mind, wind get hold you, too.” “Do want help her, North Wind?” “Not without idea happen. If break cry, much help her, make goose little Diamond.” “I want go,” said Diamond. “Only one thing--how I get home?” “If anxious that, perhaps better go me. I bound take home again, do.” “There!” cried Diamond, still looking little girl. “I sure wind blow over, perhaps kill her. Do let go.” They sweeping slowly along line street. There lull roaring. “Well, though I cannot promise take home,” said North Wind, sank nearer nearer tops houses, “I promise right end. You get home somehow. Have made mind do?” “Yes; help little girl,” said Diamond firmly. The moment North Wind dropt street stood, tall lady, hair flying housetops. She put hands back, took Diamond, set street. The moment caught fierce coils blast, blown away. North Wind stepped back step, towered stature height houses. A chimney-pot clashed Diamond's feet. He turned terror, look little girl, turned lady vanished, wind roaring along street bed invisible torrent. The little girl scudding blast, hair flying too, behind dragged broom. Her little legs going fast ever could keep falling. Diamond crept shelter doorway, thinking stop her; passed like bird, crying gently pitifully. “Stop! stop! little girl,” shouted Diamond, starting pursuit. “I cannot,” wailed girl, “the wind leave go me.” Diamond could run faster she, broom. In moments caught frock, tore hand, away went little girl. So run again, time ran fast got her, turning round caught arms, went together, made little girl laugh midst crying. “Where going?” asked Diamond, rubbing elbow stuck farthest out. The arm belonged twined round lamp-post stood little girl wind. “Home,” said, gasping breath. “Then I go you,” said Diamond. And silent while, wind blew worse ever, hold lamp-post. “Where crossing?” asked girl length. “I sweep,” answered Diamond. “What do, then?” asked she. “You big enough things.” “I know I do,” answered he, feeling rather ashamed. “Nothing, I suppose. My father's Mr. Coleman's coachman.” “Have father?” said, staring boy father natural curiosity. “Yes. Have you?” returned Diamond. “No; mother neither. Old Sal's I got.” And began cry again. “I would go good me,” said Diamond. “But must go somewheres.” “Move on,” said voice policeman behind them. “I told so,” said girl. “You must go somewheres. They always it.” “But old Sal beat you, she?” “I wish would.” “What mean?” asked Diamond, quite bewildered. “She would mother. But would lie abed a-cuddlin' ugly old bones, laugh hear crying door.” “You mean let to-night?” “It good chance does.” “Why late, then?” asked Diamond. “My crossing's long way West End, I indulgin' door-steps mewses.” “We would better try anyhow,” said Diamond. “Come along.” As spoke Diamond thought caught glimpse North Wind turning corner front them; turned corner too, found quiet there, saw nothing lady. “Now lead me,” said, taking hand, “and I take care you.” The girl withdrew hand, dry eyes frock, enough broom. She put again, led him, turning turning, stopped cellar-door dirty lane. There knocked. “I like live here,” said Diamond. “Oh, yes, would, nowhere else go to,” answered girl. “I wish may get in.” “I want go in,” said Diamond. “Where mean go, then?” “Home home.” “Where that?” “I exactly know.” “Then worse I am.” “Oh no, North Wind--” began Diamond, stopped, hardly knew why. “What?” said girl, held ear door listening. But Diamond reply. Neither old Sal. “I told so,” said girl. “She wide awake hearkening. But get in.” “What do, then?” asked Diamond. “Move on,” answered. “Where?” “Oh, anywheres. Bless you, I used it.” “Had better come home me, then?” “That good joke, know is. Come on.” “But where?” “Oh, nowheres particular. Come on.” Diamond obeyed. The wind fallen considerably. They wandered on, turning direction that, without reason one way another, got thick houses waste kind place. By time tired. Diamond felt good deal inclined cry, thought silly get back North Wind; would minded done girl good; thought use her. He mistaken there, far happier Diamond wandering alone. She seem tired was. “Do let us rest bit,” said Diamond. “Let us see,” answered. “There something like railway there. Perhaps open arch.” They went towards found one, and, better still, empty barrel lying arch. “Hallo! are!” said girl. “A barrel's jolliest bed going--on tramp, I mean. We forty winks, go again.” She crept in, Diamond crept beside her. They put arms round other, began grow warm, Diamond's courage began come back. “This jolly!” said. “I glad!” “I think much it,” said girl. “I used it, I suppose. But I cannot think kid like comes alone time night.” She called kid, really month older was; work bread, soon makes people older. “But I late I got help you,” said Diamond. “North Wind gone home long ago.” “I think must ha' got one Hidget Asylms,” said girl. “You said something north wind afore I could get rights of.” So now, sake character, Diamond tell whole story. She believe word it. She said flat believe bosh. But spoke came great blast wind arch, set barrel rolling. So made haste get it, notion rolled packed tight would hurt, like barrel herrings. “I thought sleep,” said Diamond; “but I cannot say I sleepy all. Come, let us go again.” They wandered on, sometimes sitting door-step, always turning lanes fields chance. They found last rising ground sloped rather steeply side. It waste kind spot below, bounded irregular wall, doors it. Outside lay broken things general, garden rollers flower-pots wine-bottles. But moment reached brow rising ground, gust wind seized blew hill fast could run. Nor could Diamond stop went bang one doors wall. To dismay burst open. When came peeped in. It back door garden. “Ah, ah!” cried Diamond, staring moments, “I thought so! North Wind takes nobody in! Here I master's garden! I tell what, little girl, bore hole old Sal's wall, put mouth it, say, 'Please, North Wind, may I go you?' see come.” “I daresay I shall. But I wind often already want it.” “I said North Wind, it.” “It one.” “It one.” “It one.” “But I know best.” “And I know better. I box ears,” said girl. Diamond got angry. But remembered even box ears, musn't box again, girl, boys must do, girls rude, go away leave them. So went door. “Good-bye, mister” said girl. This brought Diamond senses. “I sorry I cross,” said. “Come in, mother give breakfast.” “No, thank you. I must crossing. It morning now.” “I sorry you,” said Diamond. “Well, life tired of--what old Sal, many holes shoes.” “I wonder good. I kill myself.” “Oh, no, would not! When I think it, I always want see coming next, I always wait till next over. Well! I suppose somebody happy somewheres. But carriages. Oh my! look sometimes--fit bite head off! Good-bye!” She ran hill disappeared behind it. Then Diamond shut door best could, ran kitchen-garden stable. And glad get blessed bed again! CHAPTER V. THE SUMMER-HOUSE DIAMOND said nothing mother adventures. He half notion North Wind friend mother, that, know it, least mind going anywhere lady wind. At time doubted whether might appear telling stories told all, especially could hardly believe thought middle day, although twilight half-way night doubt it, least first days her. The girl swept crossing certainly refused believe him. Besides, felt sure North Wind would tell ought speak. It time saw lady wind again. Indeed nothing remarkable took place Diamond's history following week. This happened then. Diamond horse wanted new shoes, Diamond's father took stable, getting back ride forge, saw little boy standing pump, looking wistfully. Then coachman took foot stirrup, left hold mane bridle, came across boy, lifted up, setting horse's back, told sit like man. He led away Diamonds together. The boy atop felt little tremulous great muscles lifted legs horse knotted relaxed legs, cowered towards withers, grasping hands bit mane worn short collar; father looked back him, saying more, “Sit up, Diamond,” let mane go sat up, notwithstanding horse, thinking, I suppose, master said him, “Come up, Diamond,” stepped faster. For Diamonds grandly obedient. And Diamond soon found that, obedient father, horse obedient him. For ridden far found courage reach forward catch hold bridle, father, whose hand upon it, felt boy pull towards him, looked smiled, and, well pleased, let go hold, left Diamond guide Diamond; boy soon found could perfectly. It grand thing able guide great beast like that. And another discovery made that, order guide horse, measure obey horse first. If yield body motions horse's body, could guide him; must fall off. The blacksmith lived distance, deeper London. As crossed angle square, Diamond, quite comfortable living throne, glancing way gentle pride, saw girl sweeping crossing scuddingly lady. The lady father's mistress, Mrs. Coleman, little girl whose sake got North Wind's back. He drew Diamond's bridle eager anxiety see whether outstretched hand would gather penny Mrs. Coleman. But given one last crossing, hand returned grasp broom. Diamond could bear it. He penny pocket, gift lady day before, tumbled horse give girl. He tumbled off, I say, tumble reached ground. But got instant, ran, searching pocket ran. She made pretty courtesy offered treasure, bewildered stare. She thought first: “Then back North Wind all!” but, looking sound horse's feet paved crossing, changed idea, saying herself, “North Wind father's horse! That secret it! Why could say so?” And mind refuse penny. But smile put right, took penny put mouth “Thank you, mister. Did wollop then?” “Oh no!” answered Diamond. “They never wollops me.” “Lor!” said little girl, speechless. Meantime father, looking up, seeing horse's back bare, suffered pang awful dread, next moment catching sight him, took put on, saying-- “Do get again, Diamond. The horse might put foot you.” “No, father,” answered boy, rode majestic safety. The summer drew near, warm splendid. Miss Coleman little better health, sat good deal garden. One day saw Diamond peeping shrubbery, called him. He talked frankly often sent that, degrees came leave run garden pleased. He never touched flowers blossoms, like boys cannot enjoy thing without pulling pieces, preventing every one enjoying them. A week even makes long time child's life, Diamond begun feel North Wind dream far-off year. One hot evening, sitting young mistress, called her, little summer-house bottom lawn--a wonderful thing beauty, boy thought, little window side made coloured glass. It grew dusky, lady began feel chill, went in, leaving boy summer-house. He sat gazing bed tulips, which, although closed night, could go quite asleep wind kept waving about. All saw great bumble-bee fly one tulips. “There! something done,” said voice--a gentle, merry, childish voice, tiny. “At last was. I thought would stay night, poor fellow! I did.” Diamond could tell whether voice near far away, small yet clear. He never seen fairy, heard such, began look one. And tiniest creature sliding stem tulip! “Are fairy herds bees?” asked, going summer-house, knees green shore tulip-bed. “I fairy,” answered little creature. “How know that?” “It would become better ask know it.” “You told me.” “Yes. But use knowing thing told it?” “Well, I know fairy? You look like one.” “In first place, fairies much bigger see me.” “Oh!” said Diamond reflectively; “I thought little.” “But might tremendously bigger I am, yet big. Why, I could six times size I am, huge. Besides, fairy cannot grow big little will, though nursery-tales say so: know better. You stupid Diamond! never seen before?” And, spoke, moan wind bent tulips almost ground, creature laid hand Diamond's shoulder. In moment knew North Wind. “I stupid,” said; “but I never saw small before, even nursing primrose.” “Must see every size measured know me, Diamond?” “But could I think taking care great stupid bumble-bee?” “The stupid need taken care of. What sucking honey trying open door, nearly dated; opened morning let sun see tulip's heart, would sun thought find stupid thing lying there--with wings too?” “But time look bees?” “I look bees. I one look after. It hard work, though.” “Hard work! Why, could blow chimney down, or--or boy's cap off,” said Diamond. “Both easier blow tulip open. But I scarcely know difference hard easy. I always able I do. When I see work, I rush it--and done. But I must chatter. I got sink ship to-night.” “Sink ship! What! men it?” “Yes, women too.” “How dreadful! I wish would talk so.” “It rather dreadful. But work. I must it.” “I hope ask go you.” “No, I ask you. But must come that.” “I then.” “Will you?” And North Wind grew tall lady, looked eyes, Diamond said-- “Please take me. You cannot cruel.” “No; I could cruel I would. I nothing cruel, although I often looks like cruel know I really doing. The people say I drown, I carry away to--to--to--well, back North Wind--that used call long ago, I never saw place.” “How carry never saw it?” “I know way.” “But never saw it?” “Because behind me.” “But look round.” “Not far enough see back. No; I always look me. In fact, I grow quite blind deaf I try see back. I mind work.” “But work?” “Ah, I cannot tell you. I know is, I I feel right, I I feel wrong. East Wind says--only one exactly know much believe says, naughty sometimes--she says managed baby; whether good naughty says that, I know. I stick work. It one let bee tulip, sweep cobwebs sky. You would like go to-night?” “I want see ship sunk.” “But suppose I take you?” “Why, then, course I must go.” “There good Diamond.--I think I better growing bit. Only must go bed first. I cannot take till bed. That law children. So I better go something else first.” “Very well, North Wind,” said Diamond. “What going first, please?” “I think I may tell you. Jump top wall, there.” “I cannot.” “Ah! I cannot help you--you bed yet, see. Come road me, front coach-house, I show you.” North Wind grew small indeed, small could blown dust dusty miller, Scotch children call yellow auricula. Diamond could even see blades grass move flitted along foot. They left lawn, went wicket the-coach-house gates, crossed road low wall separated river. “You get wall, Diamond,” said North Wind. “Yes; mother forbidden me.” “Then not,” said North Wind. “But I see over,” said Diamond. “Ah! sure. I cannot.” So saying, North Wind gave little bound, stood top wall. She height dragon-fly would be, stood end. “You darling!” said Diamond, seeing lovely little toy-woman was. “Do impertinent, Master Diamond,” said North Wind. “If one thing makes angry another, way humans judge things size. I quite respectable I shall six hours this, I take East Indiaman royals, twist round, push under. You right address fashion.” But spoke, tiny face wore smile great, grand woman. She beautiful fun Diamond, true woman's fun never hurts. “But look there!” resumed. “Do see boat one man it--a green white boat?” “Yes; quite well.” “That poet.” “I thought said bo-at.” “Stupid pet! Do know poet is?” “Why, thing sail water in.” “Well, perhaps far wrong. Some poets carry people sea. But I business talk much. The man poet.” “The boat boat,” said Diamond. “Cannot spell?” asked North Wind. “Not well.” “So I see. A poet bo-at, call it. A poet man glad something, tries make people glad too.” “Ah! I know. Like man sweety-shop.” “Not very. But I see use. I sent tell you, I cannot tell you. I must off. Only first look man.” “He much rower” said Diamond--“paddling first one fin other.” “Now look here!” said North Wind. And flashed like dragon-fly across water, whose surface rippled puckered passed. The next moment man boat glanced him, bent oars. The boat flew rippling water. Man boat river awake. The instant almost, North Wind perched upon river wall. “How that?” asked Diamond. “I blew face,” answered North Wind. “I see could it,” said Diamond. “I daresay not. And therefore say believe could.” “No, no, dear North Wind. I know well believe you.” “Well, I blew face, woke up.” “But good it?” “Why! see? Look him--how pulling. I blew mist him.” “How that?” “That I cannot tell you.” “But it.” “Yes. I ten thousand things without able tell how.” “I like that,” said Diamond. He staring boat. Hearing answer, looked wall. North Wind gone. Away across river went long ripple--what sailors call cat's paw. The man boat putting sail. The moon coming edge great cloud, sail began shine white. Diamond rubbed eyes, wondered about. Things seemed going around him, understand other, could make nothing it. So put hands pockets, went tea. The night hot, wind fallen again. “You seem well to-night, Diamond,” said mother. “I quite well, mother,” returned Diamond, puzzled. “I think better go bed,” added. “Very well, mother,” answered. He stopped one moment look window. Above moon clouds going different ways. Somehow troubled him, but, notwithstanding, soon fast asleep. He woke middle night darkness. A terrible noise rumbling overhead, like rolling beat great drums echoing brazen vault. The roof loft lay ceiling; tiles sky. For could come quite awake, noise kept beating down, heart troubled fluttered painfully. A second peal thunder burst head, almost choked fear. Nor recover great blast followed, torn tiles roof, sent spout wind bed face, brought wide awake, gave back courage. The moment heard mighty yet musical voice calling him. “Come up, Diamond,” said. “It ready. I waiting you.” He looked bed, saw gigantic, powerful, lovely arm--with hand whose fingers nothing less ladylike could strangled boa-constrictor, choked tigress prey--stretched big hole roof. Without moment's hesitation reached tiny one, laid grand palm him. CHAPTER VI. OUT IN THE STORM THE hand felt way arm, and, grasping gently strongly elbow, lifted Diamond bed. The moment hole roof, winds heaven seemed lay hold upon him, buffet hither thither. His hair blew one way, night-gown another, legs threatened float him, head grow dizzy swiftness invisible assailant. Cowering, clung hand huge hand held arm, fear invaded heart. “Oh, North Wind!” murmured, words vanished lips seen soap-bubbles burst soon vanish mouth pipe. The wind caught them, nowhere. They could get all, torn away strangled. And yet North Wind heard them, answer seemed Diamond big could help it, ear mouth must seem dreadfully far away, spoke tenderly graciously ever before. Her voice like bass deep organ, without groan it; like delicate violin tones without wail it; like glorious trumpet-ejaculations without defiance it; like sound falling water without clatter clash it: like neither them--all without faults, without peculiarity: all, like mother's voice anything else world. “Diamond, dear,” said, “be man. What fearful least fearful me.” “But cannot hurt you,” murmured Diamond, “for it.” “Then I it, arms, hurt you?” “Oh yes! I see,” whispered Diamond. “But looks dreadful, pushes so.” “Yes, does, dear. That sent for.” At moment, peal thunder shook Diamond's heart sides bosom hurtled heavens: I cannot say sky, sky. Diamond seen lightning, intent finding face North Wind. Every moment folds garment would sweep across eyes blind him, between, could persuade saw great glories woman's eyes looking rifts mountainous clouds head. He trembled thunder, knees failed him, sunk North Wind's feet, clasped round column ankle. She instantly stooped, lifted roof--up--up bosom, held there, saying, inconsolable child-- “Diamond, dear, never do.” “Oh yes, will,” answered Diamond. “I right now--quite comfortable, I assure you, dear North Wind. If let stay here, I shall right indeed.” “But feel wind here, Diamond.” “I mind bit, long I feel arms it,” answered Diamond, nestling closer grand bosom. “Brave boy!” returned North Wind, pressing closer. “No,” said Diamond, “I see that. It courage all, long I feel there.” “But better get hair? Then would feel wind; here.” “Ah, but, dear North Wind, know nice feel arms me. It thousand times better wind together, hair back neck wind all.” “But surely comfortable there?” “Well, perhaps; I begin think better things comfortable.” “Yes, indeed are. Well, I keep front me. You feel wind, much. I shall want one arm take care you; quite enough sink ship.” “Oh, dear North Wind! talk so?” “My dear boy, I never talk; I always mean I say.” “Then mean sink ship hand?” “Yes.” “It like you.” “How know that?” “Quite easily. Here taking care poor little boy one arm, sinking ship other. It cannot like you.” “Ah! me? I cannot two mes, know.” “No. Nobody two mes.” “Well, me?” “Now I must think. There looks two.” “Yes. That point.--You cannot knowing thing know, you?” “No.” “Which know?” “The kindest, goodest, best world,” answered Diamond, clinging North Wind. “Why I good you?” “I know.” “Have ever done anything me?” “No.” “Then I must good I choose good you.” “Yes.” “Why I choose?” “Because--because--because like.” “Why I like good you?” “I know, except good good me.” “That it; I good I like good.” “Then good people well me?” “That I know. Why I?” “I know either. Then you?” “Because I am.” “There again,” said Diamond. “I see are. It looks quite thing.” “Well, listen me, Diamond. You know one me, say, good.” “Yes.” “Do know well?” “No. I cannot. I like to.” “There is. You know me. You sure one them?” “Yes.” “And sure cannot two mes?” “Yes.” “Then know must know,--else would two mes?” “Yes.” “Then know must kind know?” “Yes.” “Besides, I tell so, look like it. That I confess freely. Have anything object?” “No, no, dear North Wind; I quite satisfied.” “Then I tell something might object. You might say know like me, I cruel through.” “I know cannot be, kind.” “But kindness might pretence sake cruel afterwards.” Diamond clung tighter ever, crying-- “No, no, dear North Wind; I cannot believe that. I believe it. I believe it. That would kill me. I love you, must love me, else I come love you? How could know put beautiful face love rest? No. You may sink many ships like, I say another word. I cannot say I shall like see it, know.” “That quite another thing,” said North Wind; spoke gave one spring roof hay-loft, rushed clouds, Diamond left arm close heart. And clouds knew come, burst fresh jubilation thunderous light. For moments, Diamond seemed borne depths ocean dazzling flame; next, winds writhing around like storm serpents. For midst clouds mists, course took shapes wind, eddying wreathing whirling shooting dashing like grey black water, wind taken shape, saw grey black wind tossing raving madly him. Now blinded smiting upon eyes; deafened bellowing ears; even thunder came knew billows great ocean air dashing haste fill hollow scooped lightning; took breath quite away sucking body speed rush. But mind it. He gasped first laughed, arm North Wind him, leaning bosom. It quite impossible describe saw. Did ever watch great wave shoot winding passage amongst rocks? If ever did, would see water rushed every way once, even turning back opposing rest; greater confusion might see nowhere except crowd frightened people. Well, wind like that, except went much faster, therefore much wilder, twisted shot curled dodged clashed raved ten times madly anything else creation except human passions. Diamond saw threads lady's hair streaking all. In parts indeed could tell hair black storm vapour. It seemed sometimes great billows mist-muddy wind woven crossing lines North Wind's infinite hair, sweeping endless intertwistings. And Diamond felt wind seized hair, mother kept rather long, part storm, life went him. But sheltered North Wind's arm bosom times, fiercer onslaught curl-billowed eddy, recognise moment wild storm carried, nestling core formative centre. It seemed Diamond likewise motionless centre, confusion fighting went around them. Flash flash illuminated fierce chaos, revealing varied yellow blue grey dusky red vapourous contention; peal peal thunder tore infinite waste; seemed Diamond North Wind motionless, hair. It so. They sweeping speed wind towards sea. CHAPTER VII. THE CATHEDRAL I MUST go describing cannot described, nothing wearisome. Before reached sea, Diamond felt North Wind's hair beginning fall him. “Is storm over, North Wind?” called out. “No, Diamond. I waiting moment set down. You would like see ship sunk, I going give place stop till I come back you.” “Oh! thank you,” said Diamond. “I shall sorry leave you, North Wind, I would rather see ship go down. And I afraid poor people cry, I hear them. Oh, dear!” “There good many passengers board; tell truth, Diamond, I care hearing cry speak of. I afraid would get little head long time.” “But bear then, North Wind? For I sure kind. I shall never doubt again.” “I tell I able bear it, Diamond: I always hearing, every noise, noise I making even, sound far-off song. I exactly know is, means; I hear much it, odour music, were, flitting across great billows ocean outside air I make storm; I hear quite enough make able bear cry drowning ship. So would could hear it.” “No, would not,” returned Diamond, stoutly. “For would hear music far-away song; did, would good. You see I going drowned, might enjoy it.” “But never heard psalm, know like. Somehow, I cannot say how, tells right; coming swallow cries.” “But good--the people, I mean,” persisted Diamond. “It must. It must,” said North Wind, hurriedly. “It would song seems swallow fear pain too, set singing rest. I sure will. And know, ever since I knew I hair, is, ever since began go away, song coming nearer nearer. Only I must say thousand years I heard it.” “But say coming nearer hear it?” asked doubting little Diamond. “Since I began hear it, I know growing louder, therefore I judge coming nearer nearer I hear first. I old, know--a thousand years only--and I quite baby I heard noise first, I knew must come voices people ever much older wiser I was. I cannot sing all, except then, I never tell song going be; I know I sung it.--But never do. Will stop here?” “I cannot see anywhere stop,” said Diamond. “Your hair like darkness, I cannot see I knock eyes ever much.” “Look, then,” said North Wind; and, one sweep great white arm, swept yards deep darkness like great curtain face boy. And lo! blue night, lit stars. Where shine stars shimmered milk stars, except where, opposite Diamond's face, grey towers cathedral blotted shape sky stars. “Oh! that?” cried Diamond, struck kind terror, never seen cathedral, rose awful reality midst wide spaces, conquering emptiness grandeur. “A good place wait in,” said North Wind. “But shall go in, shall judge yourself.” There open door middle one towers, leading upon roof, passed. Then North Wind set Diamond feet, found top stone stair, went twisting away darkness little light came door. It enough, however, allow Diamond see North Wind stood beside him. He looked find face, saw longer beautiful giantess, tall gracious lady liked best see. She took hand, and, giving broad part spiral stair walk on, led good way; then, opening another little door, led upon narrow gallery ran round central part church, ledges windows clerestory, openings parts wall divided windows other. It narrow, except passing wall, Diamond saw nothing keep falling church. It lay like great silent gulf hollowed stone, held breath fear looked down. “What trembling for, little Diamond?” said lady, walked gently along, hand held behind leading him, breadth enough walk side side. “I afraid falling there,” answered Diamond. “It deep down.” “Yes, rather,” answered North Wind; “but hundred times higher minutes ago.” “Ah, yes, somebody arm then,” said Diamond, putting little mouth beautiful cold hand hold his. “What dear little warm mouth got!” said North Wind. “It pity talk nonsense it. Do know I hold you?” “Yes; I walking legs, might slip. I cannot trust well arms.” “But I hold you, I tell you, foolish child.” “Yes, somehow I cannot feel comfortable.” “If fall, hold give way, I less moment lady's watch tick, catch long reached ground.” “I like though,” said Diamond. “Oh! oh! oh!” screamed next moment, bent double terror, North Wind let go hold hand, vanished, leaving standing rooted gallery. She left words, “Come me,” sounding ears. But move dared not. In moment would terror fallen church, suddenly came gentle breath cool wind upon face, kept blowing upon little puffs, every puff Diamond felt faintness going away, fear it. Courage reviving little heart, still cool wafts soft wind breathed upon him, soft wind mighty strong within gentleness, minute Diamond marching along narrow ledge fearless time North Wind herself. He walked on, windows row one side him, great empty nave church echoing every one brave strides other, last came little open door, broader stair led down, till last found arms North Wind, held close her, kissed forehead. Diamond nestled her, murmured bosom,--“Why leave me, dear North Wind?” “Because I wanted walk alone,” answered. “But much nicer here!” said Diamond. “I daresay; I could hold little coward heart. It would make cold!” “But I brave myself,” said Diamond, older readers already discovered true child this, given metaphysics. “It wind blew face made brave. Was now, North Wind?” “Yes: I know that. You taught courage was. And could know without feeling it: therefore given you. But feel would try brave next time?” “Yes, I do. But trying much.” “Yes, is--a great deal, beginning. And beginning greatest thing all. To try brave brave. The coward tries brave man brave made so, never try.” “How kind are, North Wind!” “I just. All kindness justice. We owe it.” “I quite understand that.” “Never mind; day. There hurry understanding now.” “Who blew wind made brave?” “I did.” “I see you.” “Therefore believe me.” “Yes, yes; course. But little breath could strong?” “That I know.” “But made strong?” “No: I blew it. I knew would make strong, man boat, remember. But breath power I cannot tell. It put I made. That I know. But really I must going work.” “Ah! poor ship! I wish would stop here, let poor ship go.” “That I dare do. Will stop till I come back?” “Yes. You long?” “Not longer I help. Trust me, shall get home morning.” In moment North Wind gone, next Diamond heard moaning church, grew grew roaring. The storm again, knew North Wind's hair flying. The church dark. Only little light came windows, almost precious old stained glass much lovelier new. But Diamond could see beautiful were, enough light stars show colours them. He could distinguish walls, He looked up, could see gallery along passed. He could tell far faint glimmer windows clerestory, whose sills made part it. The church grew lonely him, began feel like child whose mother forsaken it. Only knew left alone always forsaken. He began feel way place, went wandering down. His little footsteps waked little answering echoes great house. It big mind him. It church knew there, meant make house. So went giving back answer every step, length Diamond thought like say something loud, see church would answer. But found afraid speak. He could utter word fear loneliness. Perhaps well not, sound spoken word would made feel place yet deserted empty. But thought could sing. He fond singing, home used sing, tunes own, nursery rhymes knew. So began try `Hey diddle diddle', would do. Then tried `Little Boy Blue', better. Neither would `Sing Song Sixpence' sing all. Then tried `Poor old Cockytoo', would do. They sounded silly! never thought silly before. So quiet, listened echoes came dark corners answer footsteps. At last gave great sigh, said, “I tired.” But hear gentle echo answered far away head, moment came lowest steps stretched across church, fell hurt arm. He cried little first, crawled steps hands knees. At top came little bit carpet, lay down; lay staring dull window rose nearly hundred feet head. Now eastern window church, moon moment edge horizon. The next, peeping it. And lo! moon, St. John St. Paul, rest them, began dawn window lovely garments. Diamond know wonder-working moon behind, thought light coming window itself, good old men appearing help him, growing night darkness, hurt arm, tired lonely, North Wind long coming. So lay looked backwards head, wondering would come would next. They dim, moonlight strong enough colours, enough eyes trying make shapes. So eyes grew tired, tired, eyelids grew heavy would keep tumbling eyes. He kept lifting lifting them, every time heavier last. It use: much him. Sometimes got half up, again; length gave quite, moment gave up, fast asleep. CHAPTER VIII. THE EAST WINDOW THAT Diamond fallen fast asleep evident strange things fancied taking place. For thought heard sound whispering great window. He tried open eyes, could not. And whispering went grew louder louder, could hear every word said. He thought Apostles talking him. But could open eyes. “And comes lying there, St. Peter?” said one. “I think I saw ago gallery, Nicodemus window. Perhaps fallen down. “What think, St. Matthew?” “I think could crept falling height. He must killed.” “What him? We cannot leave lying there. And could make comfortable window: rather crowded already. What say, St. Thomas?” “Let us go look him.” There came rustling, chinking, time, silence, Diamond felt somehow Apostles standing round looking him. And still could open eyes. “What matter him, St. Luke?” asked one. “There nothing matter him,” answered St. Luke, must joined company Apostles next window, one would think. “He sound sleep.” “I it,” cried another. “This one North Wind's tricks. She caught dropped door, like withered leaf foundling baby. I understand woman's conduct, I must say. As enough money, without going taking care people's children! That forefathers built cathedrals for.” Now Diamond could bear hear things North Wind, who, knew, never played anybody trick. She far busy work that. He struggled hard open eyes, without success. “She consider church place pranks, mention live it,” said another. “It certainly disrespectful her. But always disrespectful. What right bang windows whole night? I daresay glass broken somewhere. I know blue robe dreadful mess rain first dust after. It cost shillings clean it.” Then Diamond knew could Apostles, talking like this. They could sextons vergers such-like, got night, put robes deans bishops, called grand names, foolish servants heard father tell call lords ladies, masters mistresses. And angry daring abuse North Wind, jumped up, crying--“North Wind knows best about. She good right blow cobwebs windows, sent it. She sweeps away grander places, I tell you, I it.” This began say, spoke eyes came wide open, behold, neither Apostles vergers there--not even window effigies holy men it, dark heap hay him, little panes roof loft glimmering blue light morning. Old Diamond coming awake stable. In moment feet, shaking young Diamond's bed trembled him. “He grand shaking himself,” said Diamond. “I wish I could shake like that. But I wash myself, cannot. What fun would see Old Diamond washing face hoofs iron shoes! Would picture?” So saying, got dressed himself. Then went garden. There must tremendous wind night, although quiet now, lay little summer-house crushed ground, great elm-tree, wind broken across, much decayed middle. Diamond almost cried see wilderness green leaves, used far blue air, tossing breeze, liking best wind blew most, lying near ground, without hope ever getting deep air again. “I wonder old tree is!” thought Diamond. “It must take long time get near sky poor tree was.” “Yes, indeed,” said voice beside him, Diamond spoken last words aloud. Diamond started, looking around saw clergyman, brother Mrs. Coleman, happened visiting her. He great scholar, habit rising early. “Who you, man?” added. “Little Diamond,” answered boy. “Oh! I heard you. How come early?” “Because sham Apostles talked nonsense, waked up.” The clergyman stared. Diamond saw better held tongue, could explain things. “You must dreaming, little man,” said he. “Dear! dear!” went on, looking tree, “there terrible work here. This north wind's doing. What pity! I wish lived back it, I sure.” “Where sir?” asked Diamond. “Away Hyperborean regions,” answered clergyman, smiling. “I never heard place,” returned Diamond. “I daresay not,” answered clergyman; “but tree now, would blown down, wind there.” “But, please, sir, there,” said Diamond, “we sorry it.” “Certainly not.” “Then glad it, either.” “You quite right, boy,” said clergyman, looking kindly, turned away house, eyes bent towards earth. But Diamond thought within himself, “I ask North Wind next time I see take country. I think speak before.” CHAPTER IX. HOW DIAMOND GOT TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND WHEN Diamond went home breakfast, found father mother already seated table. They busy bread butter, Diamond sat usual place. His mother looked him, and, watching moment, said: “I think boy looking well, husband.” “Do you? Well, I know. I think looks pretty bobbish. How feel yourself, Diamond, boy?” “Quite well, thank you, father; least, I think I got little headache.” “There! I told you,” said father mother once. “The child's poorly” added mother. “The child's quite well,” added father. And laughed. “You see,” said mother, “I letter sister Sandwich.” “Sleepy old hole!” said father. “Do abuse place; good people it,” said mother. “Right, old lady,” returned father; “only I believe two pair carriage-horses whole blessed place.” “Well, people get heaven without carriages--or coachmen either, husband. Not I like go without coachman, know. But boy?” “What boy?” “That boy, there, staring goggle-eyes.” “Have I got goggle-eyes, mother?” asked Diamond, little dismayed. “Not goggle,” said mother, quite proud boy's eyes, want make vain. “Not goggle; need stare so.” “Well, him?” said father. “I told I got letter.” “Yes, sister; Diamond.” “La, husband! got bed wrong leg first morning, I believe.” “I always get once,” said father, laughing. “Well, listen then. His aunt wants boy go see her.” “And want make looking well.” “No is. I think better go.” “Well, I care, find money,” said father. “I manage that,” said mother; agreed Diamond go Sandwich. I describe preparations Diamond made. You would thought going three months' voyage. Nor I describe journey, business place. He met station aunt, cheerful middle-aged woman, conveyed safety sleepy old town, father called it. And wonder sleepy, nearly dead old age. Diamond went staring beautiful goggle-eyes, quaint old streets, shops, houses. Everything looked strange, indeed; town abandoned nurse, sea, like old oyster left shore till gaped weariness. It used one five chief seaports England, began hold high, consequence sea grew less less intimate it, gradually drew back, kept itself, till length left high dry: Sandwich seaport more; sea went tide-business long way off, forgot it. Of course went sleep, ships. That comes cities nations, boys girls, say, “I without help. I enough myself.” Diamond soon made great friends old woman kept toyshop, mother given twopence pocket-money left, gone shop spend it, got talking him. She looked funny, got teeth, Diamond liked her, went often shop, although nothing spend twopence gone. One afternoon wandering rather wearily streets time. It hot day, felt tired. As passed toyshop, stepped in. “Please may I sit minute box?” said, thinking old woman somewhere shop. But got answer, sat without one. Around great many toys prices, penny shillings. All heard gentle whirring somewhere amongst them. It made start look behind him. There sails windmill going round round almost close ear. He thought first must one toys wound go clockwork; no, common penny toy, windmill end whistle, whistle blows windmill goes. But wonder one whistle end blowing, yet sails turning round round--now faster, slower, faster again. “What mean?” said Diamond, aloud. “It means me,” said tiniest voice ever heard. “Who you, please?” asked Diamond. “Well, really, I begin ashamed you,” said voice. “I wonder long know me; often I might take got sharp enough suspect me. You bad baby know mother new bonnet.” “Not quite bad that, dear North Wind,” said Diamond, “for I see all, indeed I see yet, although I recognise voice. Do grow little, please.” “Not hair's-breadth,” said voice, smallest voice ever spoke. “What here?” “I come see aunt. But, please, North Wind, come back church night?” “I did. I carried safe home. All time dreaming glass Apostles, lying arms.” “I glad,” said Diamond. “I thought must it, I wanted hear say so. Did sink ship, then?” “Yes.” “And drown everybody?” “Not quite. One boat got away six seven men it.” “How could boat swim ship could not?” “Of course I trouble it. I contrive bit, manage waves little. When thoroughly waked up, I good deal trouble sometimes. They apt get stupid tumbling other's heads. That fairly it. However, boat got desert island noon next day.” “And good come that?” “I know. I obeyed orders. Good bye.” “Oh! stay, North Wind, stay!” cried Diamond, dismayed see windmill get slower slower. “What it, dear child?” said North Wind, windmill began turning swiftly Diamond could scarcely see it. “What big voice got! noise make it? What want? I little do, little must done.” “I want take country back north wind.” “That easy,” said North Wind, silent long Diamond thought gone indeed. But quite given up, voice began again. “I almost wish old Herodotus held tongue it. Much knew it!” “Why wish that, North Wind?” “Because clergyman would never heard it, set wanting go. But shall see. We shall see. You must go home now, dear, seem well, I see done you. Do wait me. I got break old Goody's toys; thinking much new stock. Two three do. There! go now.” Diamond rose, quite sorry, without word left shop, went home. It soon appeared mother right him, afternoon head began ache much, go bed. He awoke middle night. The lattice window room blown open, curtains little bed swinging wind. “If North Wind now!” thought Diamond. But next moment heard one closing window, aunt came bedside. She put hand face, said-- “How head, dear?” “Better, auntie, I think.” “Would like something drink?” “Oh, yes! I should, please.” So aunt gave lemonade, used nursing sick people, Diamond felt much refreshed, laid head go fast asleep, thought. And did, come awake again, fresh burst wind blew lattice open second time. The moment found cloud North Wind's hair, beautiful face, set like moon, bending him. “Quick, Diamond!” said. “I found chance!” “But I well,” said Diamond. “I know that, better little fresh air. You shall plenty that.” “You want go, then?” “Yes, I do. It hurt you.” “Very well,” said Diamond; getting bed-clothes, jumped North Wind's arms. “We must make haste aunt comes,” said she, glided open lattice left swinging. The moment Diamond felt arms fold around began feel better. It moonless night, dark, glimpses stars clouds parted. “I used dash waves here,” said North Wind, “where cows sheep feeding now; shall soon get them. There are.” And Diamond, looking down, saw white glimmer breaking water far him. “You see, Diamond,” said North Wind, “it difficult get back north wind, country lies north itself, course I cannot blow northwards.” “Why not?” asked Diamond. “You little silly!” said North Wind. “Do see I blow northwards I South Wind, much say one person could two persons?” “But ever get home all, then?” “You quite right--that home, though I never get farther outer door. I sit doorstep, hear voices inside. I nobody there, Diamond.” “I sorry.” “Why?” “That nobody.” “Oh, I mind it. Dear little man! glad day nobody yourself. But cannot understand now, better try; do, certain go fancying egregious nonsense, making miserable it.” “Then I not,” said Diamond. “There good boy. It come good time.” “But told get doorstep, know.” “It easy enough me. I consent nobody, I am. I draw I doorstep. But easily see, less sense I think, drag you, heavy thing, along me, would take centuries, I could give time it.” “Oh, I sorry!” said Diamond. “What now, pet?” “That I heavy you. I would lighter I could, I know how.” “You silly darling! Why, I could toss hundred miles I liked. It I going home I shall find heavy.” “Then going home me?” “Of course. Did I come fetch that?” “But time must going southwards.” “Yes. Of course I am.” “How taking northwards, then?” “A sensible question. But shall see. I get rid clouds--only come fast! It like trying blow brook dry. There! What see now?” “I think I see little boat, away there, below.” “A little boat, indeed! Well! She yacht two hundred tons; captain friend mine; man good sense, sail craft well. I helped many time little thought it. I heard grumbling me, I best I could him. Why, I carried eighty miles day, again, right north.” “He must dodged that,” said Diamond, watching vessels, seen went ways wind blew. “Of course must. But see, best I could do? I could South Wind. And besides gave share business. It good all--mind that, Diamond--to everything love, give share doing. It kind. It making much yourself, child. If I South Wind, would smoked pipe day, made stupid.” “But could man sense grumble best him?” “Oh! must make allowances,” said North Wind, “or never justice anybody.--You understand, then, captain may sail north----” “In spite north wind--yes,” supplemented Diamond. “Now, I think must stupid, dear” said North Wind. “Suppose north wind blow would then?” “Why south wind would carry him.” “So think north wind stops south wind blows. Nonsense. If I blow, captain could sail eighty miles day. No doubt South Wind would carry faster, South Wind sitting doorstep then, I stopped would dead calm. So wrong say sail north spite me; sails north help, help alone. You see that, Diamond?” “Yes, I do, North Wind. I stupid, I want stupid.” “Good boy! I going blow north little craft, one finest ever sailed sea. Here are, right it. I shall blowing you; sailing me; want it. The captain get fast would like, get on, shall we. I going put board. Do see front tiller--that thing man working, one side, other--a round thing like top drum?” “Yes,” said Diamond. “Below keep spare sails, stores sort. I going blow cover off. The moment I drop deck, must tumble in. Do afraid, depth, fall sail-cloth. You find nice warm dry-only dark; know I near every roll pitch vessel. Coil go sleep. The yacht shall cradle shall baby.” “Thank you, dear North Wind. I bit afraid,” said Diamond. In moment level bulwarks, North Wind sent hatch after-store rattling away deck leeward. The next, Diamond found dark, tumbled hole North Wind told him, cover replaced head. Away went rolling leeward, wind began blow hard. He heard call captain, loud trampling men head, hauled main sheet get boom board might take reef mainsail. Diamond felt found seemed comfortable place, snuggled lay. Hours hours, great many them, went by; still Diamond lay there. He never felt least tired impatient, strange pleasure filled heart. The straining masts, creaking boom, singing ropes, banging blocks put vessel about, fell roaring wind above, surge waves past sides, thud every one would strike her; Diamond could hear gurgling, rippling, talking flow water planks, slipped it, lying side, that--like subdued air running grand music North Wind making keep tiring sped towards country back doorstep. How long lasted Diamond idea. He seemed fall asleep sometimes, sleep heard sounds going on. At length weather seemed get worse. The confusion trampling feet grew frequent head; vessel lay side, went roaring waves, banged thumped anger. All arose terrible uproar. The hatch blown off; cold fierce wind swept upon him; long arm came laid hold lifted out. The moment saw little vessel far righting herself. She taken sails lay tossing waves like sea-bird folded wings. A short distance south lay much larger vessel, two three sails set, towards North Wind carrying Diamond. It German ship, way North Pole. “That vessel give us lift now,” said North Wind; “and I must best I can.” She managed hide amongst flags big ship, snugly stowed away, sped towards north. At length one night whispered ear, “Come deck, Diamond;” got crept deck. Everything looked strange. Here sides huge masses floating ice, looking like cathedrals, castles, crags, away beyond blue sea. “Is sun rising setting?” asked Diamond. “Neither both, please. I hardly tell myself. If setting now, rising next moment.” “What strange light is!” said Diamond. “I heard sun go bed summer parts. Miss Coleman told that. I suppose feels sleepy, light sends looks like dream.” “That account well enough practical purposes,” said North Wind. Some icebergs drifting northwards; one passing near ship. North Wind seized Diamond, single bound lighted one them--a huge thing, sharp pinnacles great clefts. The instant wind began blow south. North Wind hurried Diamond north side iceberg, stepping jags splintering; berg never got far enough south melted smoothed summer sun. She brought cave near water, entered, and, letting Diamond go, sat weary ledge ice. Diamond seated side, enraptured colour air inside cave. It deep, dazzling, lovely blue, deeper deepest blue sky. The blue seemed constant motion, like blackness press eyeballs fingers, boiling sparkling. But looked across North Wind frightened; face worn livid. “What matter you, dear North Wind?” said. “Nothing much. I feel faint. But must mind it, I bear quite well. South Wind always blows faint. If cool thick ice her, I faint altogether. Indeed, is, I fear I must vanish.” Diamond stared terror, saw form face growing, small, transparent, like something dissolving, water, light. He could see side blue cave heart. And melted away till left pale face, like moon morning, two great lucid eyes it. “I going, Diamond,” said. “Does hurt you?” asked Diamond. “It uncomfortable,” answered; “but I mind it, I shall come right long. I thought I able go way, I cannot. You must frightened though. Just go straight on, come right. You find doorstep.” As spoke, face faded quite away, Diamond thought could still see eyes shining blue. When went closer, however, found thought eyes two hollows ice. North Wind quite gone; Diamond would cried, trusted thoroughly. So sat still blue air cavern listening wash ripple water base iceberg, sped open sea northwards. It excellent craft go current, twice much water above. But light south wind blowing too, went fast. After little Diamond went sat edge floating island, looked ocean beneath him. The white sides berg reflected much light water, could see far green abyss. Sometimes fancied saw eyes North Wind looking below, fancy never lasted beyond moment birth. And time passed know how, felt dream. When got tired green water, went blue cave; got tired blue cave went gazed blue sea, ever sparkling sun, kept wheeling sky, never going horizon. But chiefly gazed northwards, see whether land appearing. All time never wanted eat. He broke little bits berg sucked them, thought nice. At length, one time came cave, spied far horizon, shining peak rose sky like top tremendous iceberg; vessel bearing straight towards it. As went peak rose rose higher higher horizon; peaks rose it, sharp edges jagged ridges connecting them. Diamond thought must place going to; right; mountains rose rose, till saw line coast feet length iceberg drove little bay, around lofty precipices snow tops, streaks ice sides. The berg floated slowly projecting rock. Diamond stepped shore, without looking behind began follow natural path led windingly towards top precipice. When reached it, found broad table ice, along could walk without much difficulty. Before him, considerable distance, rose lofty ridge ice, shot fantastic pinnacles towers battlements. The air cold, seemed somehow dead, slightest breath wind. In centre ridge appeared gap like opening valley. But walked towards it, gazing, wondering whether could way take, saw appeared gap form woman seated ice front ridge, leaning forwards hands lap, hair hanging ground. “It North Wind doorstep,” said Diamond joyfully, hurried on. He soon came place, form sat, like one great figures door Egyptian temple, motionless, drooping arms head. Then Diamond grew frightened, move speak. He sure North Wind, thought must dead last. Her face white snow, eyes blue air ice-cave, hair hung straight, like icicles. She greenish robe, like colour hollows glacier seen far off. He stood her, gazed fearfully face minutes ventured speak. At length, great effort trembling voice, faltered out-- “North Wind!” “Well, child?” said form, without lifting head. “Are ill, dear North Wind?” “No. I waiting.” “What for?” “Till I wanted.” “You care more,” said Diamond, almost crying now. “Yes I do. Only I cannot show it. All love bottom heart. But I feel bubbling there.” “What want next, dear North Wind?” said Diamond, wishing show love obedient. “What want yourself?” “I want go country back.” “Then must go me.” “I know mean.” “I mean I say. You must walk I open door, go right me.” “But hurt you.” “Not least. It hurt you, though.” “I mind that, tell it.” “Do it,” said North Wind. Diamond walked towards instantly. When reached knees, put hand lay her, nothing save intense cold. He walked on. Then grew white him; cold stung like fire. He walked still, groping whiteness. It thickened him. At last, got heart, lost sense. I would say fainted--only whereas common faints grows black you, felt swallowed whiteness. It reached North Wind's heart fainted fell. But fell, rolled threshold, thus Diamond got back north wind. CHAPTER X. AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND I HAVE come difficult part story. And why? Because I know enough it. And I know much part part? For course I could know nothing story except Diamond told it; Diamond tell country back north wind, well adventures getting there? Because, came back, forgotten great deal, remember hard tell. Things different things here! The people speak language one thing. Indeed, Diamond insisted speak all. I think right, may well appeared Diamond. The fact is, different reports place trustworthy people. Therefore bound believe appears somewhat different different people. All, however, agree general way it. I tell something two different people reported, knew it, I believe, Herodotus. One speaks experience, visited country; testimony young peasant girl came back month's visit friends. The former great Italian noble family, died five hundred years ago; latter Scotch shepherd died forty years ago. The Italian, then, informs us enter country fire hot would thrown boiling glass cool himself. This Diamond's experience, Durante--that name Italian, means Lasting, books last long enough men world worthy them--Durante elderly man, Diamond little boy, experience must little different. The peasant girl, hand, fell fast asleep wood, woke country. In describing it, Durante says ground everywhere smelt sweetly, gentle, even-tempered wind, never blew faster slower, breathed face went, making leaves point one way, disturb birds tops trees, but, contrary, sounding bass song. He describes also little river full little waves, hurried along, bent grass, full red yellow flowers, flowed. He says purest stream world beside one would look mixed something belong it, even although flowing ever brown shadow trees, neither sun moon could shine upon it. He seems imply always month May country. It would place describe wonderful sights saw, music another key story, I shall therefore add account traveller, people free healthy, every one crown like king mitre like priest. The peasant girl--Kilmeny name--could report grand things Durante, for, shepherd says, telling story I tell Diamond's-- “Kilmeny knew where, And Kilmeny seen could declare; Kilmeny cock never crew, Where rain never fell, wind never blew. But seemed harp sky rung, And airs heaven played round tongue, When spoke lovely forms seen, And land sin never been; A land love land light, Withouten sun, moon, night; Where river swayed living stream, And light pure cloudless beam: The land vision would seem, And still everlasting dream.” The last two lines shepherd's remark, matter opinion. But clear, I think, Kilmeny must described country Durante saw, though, experience, could neither understand describe well. Now I must give fragments recollection Diamond able bring back him. When came fell, found back north wind. North Wind nowhere seen. Neither vestige snow ice within sight. The sun vanished; matter, plenty certain still rayless light. Where came never found out; thought belonged country itself. Sometimes thought came flowers, bright, strong colour. He said river--for agree river there--flowed through, grass: channel, instead rock, stones, pebbles, sand, anything else, pure meadow grass, long. He insisted sing tunes people's ears, sung tunes heads, proof I may mention that, troubles followed, Diamond often heard singing; asked singing, would answer, “One tunes river back north wind sung.” And I may well say Diamond never told things one but--no, I better say was; whoever told me, I thought would well write child-readers. He could say happy there, neither father mother him, felt still quiet patient contented, that, far mere feeling went, something better mere happiness. Nothing went wrong back north wind. Neither anything quite right, thought. Only everything going right day. His account disagreed Durante, agreed Kilmeny, this, protested wind all. I fancy missed it. At events could without wind. It depends big lungs whether wind strong us not. When person told asked whether saw anybody knew there, answered, “Only little girl belonging gardener, thought lost her, quite mistaken, safe enough, come back day, I came back, would wait.” “Did talk her, Diamond?” “No. Nobody talks there. They look other, understand everything.” “Is cold there?” “No.” “Is hot?” “No.” “What then?” “You never think things there.” “What queer place must be!” “It good place.” “Do want go back again?” “No; I think I left it; I feel here, somewhere.” “Did people look pleased?” “Yes--quite pleased, little sad.” “Then look glad?” “They looked waiting gladder day.” This Diamond used answer questions country. And I take story again, tell got back country. CHAPTER XI. HOW DIAMOND GOT HOME AGAIN WHEN one back north wind wanted know things going one loved, go certain tree, climb stem, sit branches. In minutes, kept still, would see something least going people loved. One day Diamond sitting tree, began long much get home again, wonder, saw mother crying. Durante says people may always follow wishes, never wish good. Diamond's wish get home, would fain follow wish. But set it? If could see North Wind! But moment got back, gone altogether sight. He never seen back. She might sitting doorstep still, looking southwards, waiting, white thin blue-eyed, wanted. Or might become mighty creature, power demanded her, gone far away upon many missions. She must somewhere, however. He could go home without her, therefore must find her. She could never intended leave always away mother. If danger that, would told him, given choice going. For North Wind right honest. How find North Wind, therefore, occupied thoughts. In anxiety mother, used climb tree every day, sit branches. However many dwellers so, never incommoded one another; moment one got tree, became invisible every one else; wide-spreading tree room every one people country it, without least interference other. Sometimes, getting down, two would meet root, would smile sweetly time, much say, “Ah, too!” One day sitting one outer branches tree, looking southwards home. Far away blue shining sea, dotted gleaming sparkling specks white. Those icebergs. Nearer saw great range snow-capped mountains, lovely meadow-grass country, stream flowing flowing it, away towards sea. As looked began wonder, whole country lay beneath like map, near looked small knew miles away. The ridge ice encircled appeared yards off, larger row pebbles child mark boundaries kingdom appropriated sea-shore. He thought could distinguish vapoury form North Wind, seated left her, side. Hastily descended tree, amazement found map model country still lay feet. He stood it. With one stride crossed river; another reached ridge ice; third stepped peaks, sank wearily North Wind's knees. For sat doorstep. The peaks great ridge ice lofty ever behind her, country back vanished Diamond's view. North Wind still Diamond left her. Her pale face white snow, motionless eyes blue caverns ice. But instant Diamond touched her, face began change like one waking sleep. Light began glimmer blue eyes. A moment more, laid hand Diamond's head, began playing hair. Diamond took hold hand, laid face it. She gave little start. “How alive are, child!” murmured. “Come nearer me.” By help stones around clambered beside her, laid bosom. She gave great sigh, slowly lifted arms, slowly folded him, clasped close. Yet moment, roused herself, came quite awake; cold bosom, pierced Diamond's bones, vanished. “Have sitting ever since I went you, dear North Wind?” asked Diamond, stroking hand. “Yes,” answered, looking old kindness. “Are tired?” “No; I often sit longer. Do know long been?” “Oh! years years,” answered Diamond. “You seven days,” returned North Wind. “I thought I hundred years!” exclaimed Diamond. “Yes, I daresay,” replied North Wind. “You away seven days; long may quite another thing. Behind back face things different! They go rule.” “I glad,” said Diamond, thinking while. “Why?” asked North Wind. “Because I long time there, little away mother. Why, expecting home Sandwich yet!” “No. But must talk longer. I got orders now, must minutes.” Next moment Diamond found sitting alone rock. North Wind vanished. A creature like great humble-bee cockchafer flew past face; could neither, insects amongst ice. It passed again, flying circles around him, concluded must North Wind herself, bigger Tom Thumb mother put nutshell lined flannel. But longer vapoury thin. She solid, although tiny. A moment more, perched shoulder. “Come along, Diamond,” said ear, smallest highest treble voices; “it time setting Sandwich.” Diamond could see her, turning head towards shoulder far could, one eye, nose came other. “Will take arms carry me?” said whisper, knew like loud voice small. “Ah! ungrateful boy,” returned North Wind, smiling “how dare make game me? Yes, I carry you, shall walk bit impertinence first. Come along.” She jumped shoulder, Diamond looked upon ground, could see nothing little spider long legs made way ice towards south. It ran fast indeed spider, Diamond ran long way it, waited it. It sooner expected, however, grown good deal. And spider grew grew went faster faster, till Diamond discovered spider, weasel; away glided weasel, away went Diamond it, took run keep weasel. And weasel grew, grew, grew, till Diamond saw weasel weasel cat. And away went cat, Diamond it. And run half mile, found cat waiting him, sitting washing face lose time. And away went cat again, Diamond it. But next time came cat, cat cat, hunting-leopard. And hunting-leopard grew jaguar, covered spots like eyes. And jaguar grew Bengal tiger. And none Diamond afraid, North Wind's back, could afraid longer whatever grew. And tiger flew snow straight line south, growing less less Diamond's eyes till black speck upon whiteness; vanished altogether. And Diamond felt would rather run farther, ice got rough. Besides, near precipices bounded sea, slackened pace walk, saying aloud himself: “When North Wind punished enough making game her, come back me; I know will, I cannot go much farther without her.” “You dear boy! It fun. Here I am!” said North Wind's voice behind him. Diamond turned, saw liked best see her, standing beside him, tall lady. “Where tiger?” asked, knew creatures picture book Miss Coleman given him. “But, course,” added, “you tiger. I puzzled forgot. I saw long way me, behind me. It odd, know.” “It must look odd you, Diamond: I see that. But odd break old pine two.” “Well, odd enough,” remarked Diamond. “So is! I forgot. Well, none things odder eat bread butter.” “Well, odd too, I think it,” persisted Diamond. “I like slice bread butter! I afraid say long is--how long seems me, is--since I anything eat.” “Come then,” said North Wind, stooping holding arms. “You shall bread butter soon. I glad find want some.” Diamond held arms meet hers, safe upon bosom. North Wind bounded air. Her tresses began lift rise spread stream flow flutter; roar hair answering roar one great glaciers beside them, whose slow torrent tumbled two three icebergs waves feet, North Wind Diamond went flying southwards. CHAPTER XII. WHO MET DIAMOND AT SANDWICH As THEY flew, fast went sea slid away like great web shot silk, blue shot grey, green shot purple. They went fast stars appeared sail away past overhead, “like golden boats,” blue sea turned upside down. And went fast Diamond went way fast--I mean went fast asleep North Wind's arms. When woke, face bending him; North Wind's; mother's. He put arms her, clasped bosom burst crying. Diamond kissed make stop. Perhaps kissing best thing crying, always stop it. “What matter, mother?” said. “Oh, Diamond, darling! ill!” sobbed. “No, mother dear. I back north wind,” returned Diamond. “I thought dead,” said mother. But moment doctor came in. “Oh! there!” said doctor gentle cheerfulness; “we better to-day, I see.” Then drew mother aside, told talk Diamond, mind might say; must kept quiet possible. And indeed Diamond much inclined talk, felt strange weak, little wonder, seeing time away sucked lumps ice, could much nourishment them. Now lying there, getting strong chicken broth nice things, I tell readers taking place home, ought told it. They may forgotten Miss Coleman poor state health. Now three reasons this. In first place, lungs strong. In second place, gentleman somewhere behaved well her. In third place, anything particular do. These three nots together enough make lady ill indeed. Of course could help first because; two causes existed, would little consequence; would little careful. The second could help quite; anything do, done well, would difficult man behave badly her. And third illness, anything worth doing, might borne bad behaviour even would made ill. It always easy, I confess, find something worth doing, difficult things constantly done, might found something tried. Her fault lay this, tried. But, sure, father mother blame never set going. Only again, nobody told father mother ought set going direction. So none would find themselves, North Wind teach them. We know North Wind busy night left Diamond cathedral. She sense blowing Colemans' house whole night. First, Miss Coleman's maid left chink mistress's window open, thinking shut it, North Wind wound hairs round lady's throat. She considerably worse next morning. Again, ship North Wind sunk night belonged Mr. Coleman. Nor readers understand heavy loss I informed getting poorer poorer time. He successful speculations been, speculated great deal right, time pulled up. It hard thing rich man grow poor; awful thing grow dishonest, kinds speculation lead man deep dishonesty thinks about. Poverty make man worthless--he may worth great deal poor rich; dishonesty goes far indeed make man value--a thing thrown dust-hole creation, like bit broken basin, dirty rag. So North Wind look Mr. Coleman, try make honest man him. So sank ship last venture, wife world called ruined. Nor yet. For board vessel Miss Coleman's lover passenger; news came vessel gone down, board perished, may sure think loss fine house garden furniture greatest misfortune world. Of course, trouble end Mr. Coleman family. Nobody suffer alone. When suffering deeply hidden heart, nobody knows anything man himself, must great good man indeed, us known, pain inside make behave less uncomfortable. But man brings money-troubles making haste rich, people must suffer way himself. The elm-tree North Wind blew night, small great trials gathered one heap, crushed Miss Coleman's pretty summer-house: fall Mr. Coleman crushed little family lived coach-house stable. Before Diamond well enough taken home, home go to. Mr. Coleman--or creditors, I know particulars--had sold house, carriage, horses, furniture, everything. He wife daughter Mrs. Crump gone live small house Hoxton, would unknown, whence could walk place business City. For old man, hoped yet retrieve fortunes. Let us hope lived retrieve honesty, tail slipped fingers last joint, beyond it. Of course, Diamond's father nothing time, hard nothing Miss Coleman. He wrote wife that, sister would keep till got place, would better them, would greatly obliged her. Meantime, gentleman bought house allowed furniture remain little while. Diamond's aunt quite willing keep long could. And indeed Diamond yet well enough moved safety. When recovered far able go out, one day mother got sister's husband, little pony-cart, carry sea-shore, leave hours. He business Ramsgate, would pick returned. A whiff sea-air would good, said, thought besides could best tell Diamond happened quite herself. CHAPTER XIII. THE SEASIDE DIAMOND mother sat upon edge rough grass bordered sand. The sun far enough past highest shine eyes looked eastward. A sweet little wind blew left side, comforted mother without letting know comforted her. Away stretched sparkling waters ocean, every wave flashed delight back face great sun, looked stillness blue house glorious silent face upon flashing children. On hand shore rounded outwards, forming little bay. There white cliffs here, north south, place rather dreary, sky got much better. Not house, creature within sight. Dry sand feet, thin wiry grass, managed grow poverty-stricken shore. “Oh dear!” said Diamond's mother, deep sigh, “it sad world!” “Is it?” said Diamond. “I know.” “How know, child? You well taken care of, I trust.” “Oh yes, I have,” returned Diamond. “I sorry! I thought taken care too. I thought father took care you. I ask it. I think must forgotten.” “Dear boy!” said mother, “your father's best man world.” “So I thought!” returned Diamond triumph. “I sure it!--Well, take good care you?” “Yes, yes, does,” answered mother, bursting tears. “But take care him? And take care us got nothing eat himself?” “Oh dear!” said Diamond gasp; “has got anything eat? Oh! I must go home him.” “No, no, child. He come yet. But become us, I know.” “Are hungry, mother? There basket. I thought put something eat it.” “O darling stupid! I say I hungry,” returned mother, smiling tears. “Then I understand all,” said Diamond. “Do tell matter.” “There people world nothing eat, Diamond.” “Then I suppose stop longer. They--they--what call--die--do they?” “Yes, do. How would like that?” “I know. I never tried. But I suppose go get something eat.” “Like enough want it,” said mother, petulantly. “That right then,” said Diamond, thinking I daresay chose put words. “Is though? Poor boy! little know things! Mr. Coleman's lost money, father nothing do, shall nothing eat by.” “Are sure, mother?” “Sure what?” “Sure shall nothing eat.” “No, thank Heaven! I sure it. I hope not.” “Then I cannot understand it, mother. There piece gingerbread basket, I know.” “O little bird! You sense sparrow picks wants, never thinks winter frost and, snow.” “Ah--yes--I see. But birds get winter, they?” “Some fall dead ground.” “They must die time. They would like birds always. Would you, mother?” “What child is!” thought mother, said nothing. “Oh! I remember,” Diamond went on. “Father told day I went Epping Forest him, rose-bushes, may-bushes, holly-bushes bird's barns, hips, haws, holly-berries, ready winter.” “Yes; true. So see birds provided for. But barns me, Diamond.” “Are there?” “No. We got work bread.” “Then let us go work,” said Diamond, getting up. “It use. We got anything do.” “Then let us wait.” “Then shall starve.” “No. There basket. Do know, mother, I think I shall call basket barn.” “It big one. And empty--where then?” “At auntie's cupboard,” returned Diamond promptly. “But cannot eat auntie's things leave starve.” “No, no. We go back father that. He found cupboard somewhere time.” “How know that?” “I know it. But I got even cupboard, I always plenty eat. I heard say I much, sometimes.” “But I tell I cupboard you, child.” “And empty, auntie opened hers.” “But cannot go on.” “How know? I think must big cupboard somewhere, little cupboards filled, know, mother.” “Well, I wish I could find door cupboard,” said mother. But moment stopped, silent good while. I cannot tell whether Diamond knew thinking, I think I know. She heard something church day before, came back upon her--something like this, eat tomorrow well to-day; wanted could missed. So, instead saying anything more, stretched hand basket, Diamond dinner. And Diamond enjoy it. For drive fresh air made quite hungry; not, like mother, trouble dine day week. The fact lived long without food back north wind, knew quite well food essential existence; fact, certain circumstances, people could live without well enough. His mother speak much dinner. After helped walk little, able much soon got tired. He get fretful, though. He glad sun wind again, fret could run about. He lay dry sand, mother covered shawl. She sat side, took bit work pocket. But Diamond felt rather sleepy, turned side gazed sleepily sand. A yards saw something fluttering. “What that, mother?” said. “Only bit paper,” answered. “It flutters bit paper would, I think,” said Diamond. “I go see like,” said mother. “My eyes none best.” So rose went found right, little book, partly buried sand. But several leaves clear sand, wind kept blowing flutterful manner. She took brought Diamond. “What it, mother?” asked. “Some nursery rhymes, I think,” answered. “I sleepy,” said Diamond. “Do read me.” “Yes, I will,” said, began one.--“But nonsense!” said again. “I try find better one.” She turned leaves searching, three times, sudden puffs, wind blew leaves rustling back verses. “Do read one,” said Diamond, seemed mind wind. “It sounded nice. I sure good one.” So mother thought might amuse him, though could find sense it. She never thought might understand it, although could not. Now I exactly know mother read, Diamond heard, thought afterwards heard. He was, however, I said, sleepy. And thought understood verses may dreaming better ones. This went-- I know river whose waters run asleep run run ever singing shallows dumb hollows sleeping deep swallows dip feathers hollows shallows merriest swallows nests bake clay cake water shake wings rake water shallows hollows hold together weather swallows merriest fellows merriest children built narrow like head arrow cut air go nicest water flowing nicest dust blowing narrow like head arrow barrow carry mud makes nicest water flowing nicest dust blowing build nest loves best nicest cakes sunshine bakes merry children callow beaks follow gaping hollow wider wider father mother food-provider brings spider worm poor hider earth dearth beaks yellow buttercups growing beside flowing singing river always ever growing blowing fast sheep awake asleep crop crop cannot stop creep go blowing daisies little white praises grow blow spread crown praise sun goes praising done fold crown sleep every one till plain shining amain praising praising low songs raising one hears sun rears sheep bite quietest sheep awake asleep merriest bleat little lambs merriest lambs forget eat frolic feet lambs dams whitest sheep woolliest wool longest wool trailingest tails shine like snow grasses grow singing river sings ever sheep lambs merry ever river sings drink lambs dams quiet white diet bite buttercups yellow daisies white grass green river make wind mellow kiss shake never seen hollows beside river swallows merriest fellows nests make clay cake sunshine bake till like bone dry wind marble stone firm bind grass clay dries wind sweetest wind blows river flowing ever never find whence comes wind blows hollows shallows dip swallows alive blows life goes awake asleep river sings flows life blows sheep awake asleep woolliest wool trailingest tails never fails gentle cool wave wool toss grass lambs sheep pass tug bite teeth white sweep trailing tails smooth grows amain amain grows wind blows tosses swallows hollows shallows till every feather doth shake quiver feathers go together blowing life joy rife swallows skim shallows yellowest children wind blows life river flowing ever washes grasses still passes feeds daisies little white praises buttercups bonny golden sunny butter honey whiten sheep awake asleep nibble bite grow whiter white merry quiet sweet diet fed river tossed ever wind tosses swallow crosses shallows dipping wings gather water bake cake wind shall make hard bone dry stone wind blows behind river flows ever grasses white daisies merry sheep awake asleep happy swallows skimming shallows wind blows behind. Here Diamond became aware mother stopped reading. “Why go on, mother dear?” asked. “It nonsense!” said mother. “I believe would go ever.” “That did,” said Diamond. “What did?” asked. “Why, river. That almost tune used sing.” His mother frightened, thought fever coming again. So contradict him. “Who made poem?” asked Diamond. “I know,” answered. “Some silly woman children, I suppose--and thought good enough print.” “She must back north wind time other, anyhow,” said Diamond. “She could got hold anywhere else. That went.” And began chant bits there; mother said nothing fear making him, worse; glad indeed saw brother-in-law jogging along little cart. They lifted Diamond in, got themselves, away went, “home again, home again, home again,” Diamond sang. But soon grew quiet, reached Sandwich fast asleep dreaming country back north wind. CHAPTER XIV. OLD DIAMOND AFTER Diamond recovered fast, days quite able go home soon father place go. Now father saved little money, finding situation offered itself, thinking new plan. A strange occurrence turned thoughts direction. He friend Bloomsbury region, lived letting cabs horses cabmen. This man, happening meet one day returning unsuccessful application, said him: “Why set now--in cab line, I mean?” “I enough that,” answered Diamond's father. “You must saved goodish bit, I think. Just come home look horse I let cheap. I bought weeks ago, thinking would Hansom, I wrong. He got bone enough waggon, waggon Hansom. He got go enough Hansom. You see parties takes Hansoms wants go like wind, got wind enough, young was. But four-wheeler takes families luggages, horse. He would carry small house day. I bought cheap, I sell cheap.” “Oh, I want him,” said Diamond's father. “A body must time think affair much importance. And cab too. That would come deal money.” “I could fit there, I daresay,” said friend. “But come look animal, anyhow.” “Since I lost old pair, Mr. Coleman's,” said Diamond's father, turning accompany cab-master, “I almost got heart look horse face. It thousand pities part man horse.” “So is,” returned friend sympathetically. But ex-coachman's delight, when, going stable friend led him, found horse wanted buy old Diamond, grown thin bony long-legged, they, could fit Hansom work! “He Hansom horse,” said Diamond's father indignantly. “Well, right. He handsome, good un” said owner. “Who says handsome? He one handsomest horses gentleman's coachman ever druv,” said Diamond's father; remarking breath--“though I says not”--for feel inclined confess old horse could sunk low. “Well,” said friend, “all I say is--There animal you, strong church; an'll go like train, leastways parly,” added, correcting himself. But coachman lump throat tears eyes. For old horse, hearing voice, turned long neck, old friend went laid hand side, whinnied joy, laid big head master's breast. This settled matter. The coachman's arms round horse's neck moment, fairly broke cried. The cab-master never fond horse hug like that, saw moment was. And must good-hearted fellow, I never heard idea coming head man horse sell: instead putting something price pretty sure selling him, actually took pound meant ask him, saying shame part old friends. Diamond's father, soon came himself, turned asked much wanted horse. “I see old friends,” said owner. “It old Diamond. I liked far best pair, though good. You got too, you?” “No; nothing stable match there.” “I believe you,” said coachman. “But wanting long price him, I know.” “No, much. I bought cheap, I say, work.” The end Diamond's father bought old Diamond again, along four-wheeled cab. And rooms stable, took them, wrote wife come home, set cabman. CHAPTER XV. THE MEWS IT WAS late afternoon Diamond mother baby reached London. I full Diamond I forgot tell baby arrived meantime. His father waiting cab, told Diamond horse was; father wanted enjoy pleasure surprise found out. He got mother without looking horse, father put Diamond's carpet-bag mother's little trunk, got upon box drove off; Diamond quite proud riding home father's carriage. But got mews, could help little dismayed first; never back north wind, I afraid would cried little. But instead that, said fine thing old furniture there. And instead helping mother miserable change, began find advantages place; every place advantages, always better worth knowing disadvantages. Certainly weather depressing, thick, dull, persistent rain falling time reached home. But happily weather changeable; besides, good fire burning room, neighbour drunken husband attended them; tea-things put out, kettle boiling fire. And good fire, tea bread butter, things cannot said miserable. Diamond's father mother were, notwithstanding, rather miserable, Diamond began feel kind darkness beginning spread mind. But moment said himself, “This never do. I cannot give this. I back north wind. Things go right there, I must try get things go right here. I got fight miserable things. They shall make miserable I help it.” I mean thought words. They perhaps grown-up thought, represent kind thing heart head. And heart head go together, nothing stand them. “What nice bread butter is!” said Diamond. “I glad like it, dear” said father. “I bought butter little shop round corner.” “It nice, thank you, father. Oh, baby waking! I take him.” “Sit still, Diamond,” said mother. “Go bread butter. You strong enough lift yet.” So took baby herself, set knee. Then Diamond began amuse him, went till little fellow shrieking laughter. For baby's world mother's arms; drizzling rain, dreary mews, even father's troubled face could touch him. What cared baby loss hundred situations? Yet neither father mother thought hard-hearted crowed laughed middle troubles. On contrary, crowing laughing infectious. His little heart full merriment could hold all, ran theirs. Father mother began laugh too, Diamond laughed till fit coughing frightened mother, made stop. His father took baby, mother put bed. But indeed change all, Sandwich, old place, instead great river huge barges mighty brown yellow sails went tacking side side like little pleasure-skiffs, long thin boats shot past eight sometimes twelve rowers, windows looked upon dirty paved yard. And garden Diamond run pleased, gay flowers feet, solemn sun-filled trees head. Neither wooden wall back bed hole North Wind come liked. Indeed, high wall, many houses mews, North Wind seldom got place all, except something must done, grand cleaning like housewives; partition head Diamond's new bed divided room occupied cabman drank much beer, came home chiefly quarrel wife pinch children. It dreadful Diamond hear scolding crying. But could make miserable, back north wind. If reader find hard believe Diamond good, must remember back north wind. If never knew boy good, ever know boy back north wind? It least strange Diamond behave did; contrary, thoroughly sensible him. We shall see got on. CHAPTER XVI. DIAMOND MAKES A BEGINNING THE wind blew loud, Diamond slept deep sleep, never heard it. My impression every time Diamond slept well remembered nothing morning, night back north wind. I almost sure woke refreshed, felt quiet hopeful day. Indeed said much, though me--that always woke sleep something mind, could tell what--could tell whether last far-off sounds river dying away distance, words endless song mother read sea-shore. Sometimes thought must twittering swallows--over shallows, you, know; may chirping dingy sparrows picking breakfast yard--how I tell? I know I know, I know I think; tell truth, I swallows sparrows. When knew coming awake, would sometimes try hard keep hold words seemed new song, one heard before--a song words music somehow appeared one; even thought got well fixed mind, ever came awaker--as would say--one line faded away it, another, another, till last nothing left lovely picture water grass daisies, something else common, commonness polished it, lovely soul it, people seldom see, and, alas! yet seldomer believe in, shining out. But would sing oddest, loveliest little songs baby--of making, mother said; Diamond said make them; made somewhere inside him, knew nothing till coming out. When woke first morning got once, saying himself, “I ill long enough, given great deal trouble; I must try use now, help mother.” When went room found lighting fire, father getting bed. They one room, besides little one, much closet, Diamond slept. He began set things rights, baby waking up, took him, nursed till mother got breakfast ready. She looking gloomy, father silent; indeed except Diamond done possibly could keep misery trying get doors windows, would grown miserable, would miserable together. But try make others comfortable way get right comfortable ourselves, comes partly able think much helping people. For Selves always pretty well pay much attention. Our Selves like little children happy enough long left games, begin interfere them, make presents nice playthings, many sweet things, begin fret spoil. “Why, Diamond, child!” said mother last, “you good mother girl--nursing baby, toasting bread, sweeping hearth! I declare body would think among fairies.” Could Diamond greater praise greater pleasure? You see forgot Self mother took care Self, loved praised Self. Our praises poison Selves, puff swell up, till lose shape beauty, become like great toadstools. But praises father mother Selves good, comfort make beautiful. They never harm. If harm, comes mixing praises them, turns nasty slimy poisonous. When father finished breakfast, rather hurry, got went yard get horse put cab. “Will come see cab, Diamond?” said. “Yes, please, father--if mother spare minute,” answered Diamond. “Bless child! I want him,” said mother cheerfully. But following father door, called back. “Diamond, hold baby one minute. I something say father.” So Diamond sat again, took baby lap, began poking face little body, laughing singing while, baby crowed like little bantam. And sang something like this--such nonsense could understand it! baby, got good world it:-- baby's a-sleeping wake baby swallows merriest fellows yellowest children would go sleeping snore like gaby disturbing mother father brother a-boring ears snoring snoring snoring particular wake baby sit perpendicular hark gushing hark rushing sheep woolliest lambs unruliest tails whitest eyes brightest baby's bonniest baby's funniest baby's shiniest baby's tiniest baby's merriest baby's worriest lambs plague dams mother's whitest dams feed lambs go crop-cropping without stop-stopping father's best swallows build nest shining shallows merriest children baby Diamond Diamond baby baby Diamond Diamond baby-- Here Diamond's knees went wild dance tossed baby shook laughter immoderate peals. His mother listening door last lines song, came tears eyes. She took baby him, gave kiss, told run father. By time Diamond got yard, horse shafts, father looping traces on. Diamond went round look horse. The sight made feel queer. He know much different horses, horses much him. But could make out. This Diamond Diamond. Diamond hang head like that; yet head hanging like one Diamond used hold high. Diamond's bones show skin like that; skin pushed shape like Diamond's skin; bones might Diamond's bones, never seen shape them. But came round front old horse, put long neck, began sniffing rubbing upper lip nose him, Diamond saw could old Diamond, father done before--put arms round neck cried--but much. “Are jolly, father?” said. “Was ever anybody lucky me? Dear old Diamond!” And hugged horse again, kissed big hairy cheeks. He could manage one time, however--the cheek far side big head. His father mounted box air, Diamond thought, used get upon coach-box, Diamond said himself, “Father's grand ever anyhow.” He kept brown livery-coat, wife taken silver buttons put brass ones instead, think polite Mr. Coleman fallen fortunes let crest seen upon box cab. Old Diamond kept collar; silver crest upon still, master thought nobody would notice that, let remain memorial better days reminded him--not unpleasantly, seeing fault either old horse's come world together. “Oh, father, let drive bit,” said Diamond, jumping box beside him. His father changed places once, putting reins hands. Diamond gathered eagerly. “Do pull mouth,” said father, “just feel, gently let know attending him. That I call talking reins.” “Yes, father, I understand,” said Diamond. Then horse said, “Go Diamond.” And old Diamond's ponderous bulk began move voice little boy. But reached entrance mews, another voice called young Diamond, which, turn, obey, mother. “Diamond! Diamond!” cried; Diamond pulled reins, horse stood still stone. “Husband,” said mother, coming up, “you never going trust reins--a baby like that?” “He must learn day, cannot begin soon. I see already born coachman,” said father proudly. “And I see well could escape it, father grandfather, great-grandfather, coachmen, I told; must come natural him, one would think. Besides, see, old Diamond's proud selves, wife. Do see turning round ears, mouths open, first word speaks tumble in? He well bred turn head, know.” “Well, but, husband, I cannot without to-day. Everything's got done, know. It first day here. And baby!” “Bless you, wife! I never meant take away--only bottom Endell Street. He watch way back.” “No thank you, father; to-day,” said Diamond. “Mother wants me. Perhaps let go another day.” “Very well, man,” said father, took reins Diamond holding him. Diamond got down, little disappointed course, went mother, pleased speak. She took hold hand tight afraid running away instead glad would leave her. Now, although know it, owner stables, man sold horse father, standing inside one stable-doors, hands pockets, heard seen passed; day John Stonecrop took great fancy little boy. And beginning came it. The evening, Diamond feeling tired day's work, wishing father would come home, Mr. Stonecrop knocked door. His mother went opened it. “Good evening, madam,” said he. “Is little master in?” “Yes, sure is--at service, I sure, Mr. Stonecrop,” said mother. “No, no, madam; I service. I a-going cab, likes come me, shall drive old horse till tired.” “It getting rather late him,” said mother thoughtfully. “You see invalid.” Diamond thought, funny thing! How could invalid even know word meant? But, course, mother right. “Oh, well,” said Mr. Stonecrop, “I let drive Bloomsbury Square, shall run home again.” “Very good, sir. And I much obliged you,” said mother. And Diamond, dancing delight, got cap, put hand Mr. Stonecrop's, went yard cab waiting. He think horse looked nearly nice Diamond, Mr. Stonecrop nearly grand father; none, less pleased. He got box, new friend got beside him. “What horse's name?” whispered Diamond, took reins man. “It nice name,” said Mr. Stonecrop. “You need call it. I give him. He go well enough without it. Give boy whip, Jack. I never carries one I drive old----” He finish sentence. Jack handed Diamond whip, which, holding half stick, managed flack haunches horse; away went. “Mind gate,” said Mr. Stonecrop; Diamond mind gate, guided nameless horse safety, pulling way according necessary. Diamond learned drive sooner accustomed told, could obey smallest hint moment. Nothing helps one get like that. Some people know told; used it, neither understand quickly able turn understand action quickly. With obedient mind one learns rights things fast enough; law universe, obey understand. “Look out!” cried Mr. Stonecrop, turning corner Bloomsbury Square. It getting dusky now. A cab approaching rather rapidly opposite direction, Diamond pulling aside, driver pulling up, escaped collision. Then knew other. “Why, Diamond, bad beginning run father,” cried driver. “But, father, would bad ending run son?” said Diamond return; two men laughed heartily. “This kind you, I sure, Stonecrop,” said father. “Not bit. He brave fellow, and'll fit drive hook week two. But I think would better let drive home now, mother like much night air, I promised take farther square.” “Come along then, Diamond,” said father, brought cab other, moved box seat beside it. Diamond jumped across, caught reins, said “Good-night, thank you, Mr. Stonecrop,” drove away home, feeling man ever yet chance feeling life. Nor father find necessary give single hint driving. Only I suspect fact old Diamond, old Diamond way stable, may something young Diamond's success. “Well, child,” said mother, entered room, “you long gone.” “No, mother; I am. Give baby.” “The baby's asleep,” said mother. “Then give me, I lay down.” But Diamond took him, woke began laugh. For indeed one merriest children. And wonder, plump plum-pudding, never ache pain lasted five minutes time. Diamond sat began sing him. baby baby babbing father's gone a-cabbing catch shilling pence make baby babbing dance old Diamond's duck say swim duck diamonds baby swallows merriest fellows bake cake water shake river flowing ever make dust clay shiniest day build nest father's best mother's whitest eyes brightest dams watch lambs cropping grass waters pass singing ever lambs shakingest tails jumpingest feet baby's funniest baby's bonniest never wails always sweet Diamond's nurse Diamond's nurse Diamond's nurse When Diamond's rhymes grew scarce, always began dancing baby. Some people wondered child could rhyme did, rhymes good, trying remember heard river sing back north wind. CHAPTER XVII. DIAMOND GOES ON DIAMOND became great favourite men mews. Some may think best place world brought in; must been, was. At first, heard good many rough bad words; like them, little harm. He know least meant, something sound them, tone voice said, Diamond felt ugly. So even stick him, say get inside him. He never took notice them, face shone pure good middle them, like primrose hailstorm. At first, face quiet sweet, smile always either awake asleep eyes, never heeded ugly words rough jokes, said there, meaning half idiot, whereas great deal sense see. And long bad words found ashamed come men's mouths Diamond near. The one would nudge remind boy within hearing, words choked got farther. When talked nicely always good answer, sometimes smart one, ready, helped much make change minds him. One day Jack gave curry-comb brush try hand upon old Diamond's coat. He used deftly, gently, yet thoroughly, far could reach, man could help admiring him. “You must make haste and, grow” said. “It horse's belly clean back dirty, know.” “Give leg,” said Diamond, moment old horse's back comb brush. He sat withers, reaching forward ate hay, curried brushed, first one side neck, other. When done asked dressing-comb, combed mane thoroughly. Then pushed back, shoulders far could reach. Then sat croup, back sides; turned around like monkey, attacked hind-quarters, combed tail. This last easy manage, lift up, every old Diamond would whisk hands, sent comb flying stable door, great amusement men. But Jack fetched again, Diamond began more, leave done whole business fairly well, first-rate, experienced fashion. All time old horse went eating hay, and, occasional whisk tail Diamond tickled scratched him, took notice proceeding. But pretence, knew well perched back, rubbing away comb brush. So quite pleased proud, perhaps said something like this-- “I stupid old horse, cannot brush coat; young godson back, cleaning like angel.” I vouch old horse thinking, difficult find old horse thinking. “Oh dear!” said Diamond done, “I tired!” And laid full length old Diamond's back. By time men stable gathered two Diamonds, much amused. One lifted down, time greater favourite before. And ever boy chance prodigy cab-driving, Diamond boy, strife came box. His mother, however, little shy company him, besides could always spare him. Also father liked could; desired enjoyed among cabmen. But one way another learn drive sorts horses, drive well, crowded streets London City. Of course man always box-seat beside him, long seldom least occasion take reins hands. For one thing never got frightened, consequently never great hurry. Yet moment came something sharp, always ready it. I must remind readers back north wind. One day, neither washing-day, cleaning-day marketing-day, Saturday, Monday--upon consequently Diamond could spared baby--his father took cab. After stray job two way, drew row upon stand Cockspur Street Pall Mall. They waited long time, nobody seemed want carried anywhere. By ladies would going home Academy exhibition, would chance job. “Though, sure,” said Diamond's father--with truth I cannot say, believed said--“some ladies hard, keeps bare sixpence mile, every one knows enough keep family cab upon. To sure law; mayhap may get law like day themselves.” As hot, Diamond's father got glass beer himself, give another old waterman. He left Diamond box. A sudden noise got up, Diamond looked round see matter. There crossing near cab-stand, girl sweeping. Some rough young imps picked quarrel her, hauling broom get away her. But pull together, holding them, scolding entreating alternately. Diamond box moment, running help girl. He got hold broom end pulled along her. But boys proceeded rougher measures, one hit Diamond nose, made bleed; could let go broom mind nose, soon dreadful figure. But presently father came back, missing Diamond, looked about. He look twice, however, could sure boy middle tumult. He rushed in, sent assailants flying directions. The girl thanked Diamond, began sweeping nothing happened, father led away. With help old Tom, waterman, soon washed decency, father set box again, perfectly satisfied account gave fray. “I could let behave poor girl--could I, father?” said. “Certainly not, Diamond,” said father, quite pleased, Diamond's father gentleman. A moment after, came girl, running, broom shoulder, calling, “Cab, there! cab!” Diamond's father turned instantly, foremost rank, followed girl. One two passing cabs heard cry, made place, girl taken care call till near enough give friends first chance. When reached curbstone--who waiting cab Mrs. Miss Coleman! They look cabman, however. The girl opened door them; gave address, penny; told cabman, away drove. When reached house, Diamond's father got rang bell. As opened door cab, touched hat do. The ladies stared moment, exclaimed together: “Why, Joseph! you?” “Yes, madam; yes, miss,” answered he, touching hat, respect could possibly put action. “It lucky day I see upon it.” “Who would thought it?” said Mrs. Coleman. “It changed times us, Joseph, often cab even; see daughter still poorly, cannot bear motion omnibuses. Indeed meant walk bit first took cab, corner, hot sun was, cold wind came street, I saw Miss Coleman must face it. But think fallen upon you, cabmen London! I know got cab.” “Well, see, madam, I chance buying old horse, I could resist him. There is, looking you, madam. Nobody knows sense head his.” The two ladies went near pat horse, noticed Diamond box. “Why, got Diamonds you,” said Miss Coleman. “How do, Diamond?” Diamond lifted cap, answered politely. “He fit drive long,” said father, proudly. “The old horse a-teaching him.” “Well, must come see us, found us out. Where live?” Diamond's father gave ladies ticket name address printed it; Mrs. Coleman took purse, saying: “And fare, Joseph?” “No, thank you, madam,” said Joseph. “It old horse took you; paid long ago.” He jumped box could say another word, parting salute drove off, leaving pavement, maid holding door them. It long time since Diamond seen North Wind, even thought much her. And father drove along, thinking her, crossing-sweeper, wondering made feel knew quite well, could remember anything her. But picture arose mind little girl running wind dragging broom her; that, degrees, recalled whole adventure night got North Wind's back London street. But could quite satisfy whether whole affair dream dreamed little boy. Only back north wind since--there could doubt that; woke every morning, always knew again. And thought thought, recalled another thing happened morning, which, although seemed mere accident, might something happened since. His father intended going stand King's Cross morning, turned Gray's Inn Lane drive there, found way blocked up, upon inquiry informed stack chimneys blown night, fallen across road. They clearing rubbish away. Diamond's father turned, made Charing Cross. That night father mother great deal talk about. “Poor things!” said mother. “it worse us. You see used grand things, come little poky house like that--it breaks heart think it.” “I know” said Diamond thoughtfully, “whether Mrs. Coleman bells toes.” “What mean, child?” said mother. “She rings fingers, anyhow,” returned Diamond. “Of course had, lady would. What it?” “When Sandwich,” said Diamond, “you said would part mother's ring, poor.” “Bless child; forgets nothing,” said mother. “Really, Diamond, body would need mind say you.” “Why?” said Diamond. “I think it.” “That why,” said mother. “Why why?” persisted Diamond, yet learned grown-up people often much grown never talk like children--and spoilt ones too. “Mrs. Coleman none poor yet. No, thank Heaven! come that.” “Is great disgrace poor?” asked Diamond, tone mother spoken. But mother, whether conscience-stricken I know hurried away bed, various attempts understand her, resumed resumed spite invading sleep, conquered last, gave in, murmuring himself, “Why why?” getting answer question. CHAPTER XVIII. THE DRUNKEN CABMAN A FEW nights this, Diamond woke suddenly, believing heard North Wind thundering along. But something quite different. South Wind moaning round chimneys, sure, happy night, voice wakened Diamond. Her voice would lulled deeper asleep. It loud, angry voice, growling like beast, raving like madman; Diamond came little wider awake, knew voice drunken cabman, wall whose room head bed. It anything pleasant hear, could help hearing it. At length came cry woman, scream baby. Thereupon Diamond thought time somebody something, somebody hand, must go see whether could something. So got put part clothes, went stair, cabman's room open upon stair, go yard, next door. This, fortunately, cabman, drunk, left open. By time reached stair, still except voice crying baby, guided right door. He opened softly, peeped in. There, leaning back chair, arms hanging sides, legs stretched supported heels, sat drunken cabman. His wife lay clothes upon bed, sobbing, baby wailing cradle. It miserable altogether. Now way people see anything miserable turn away sight, try forget it. But Diamond began usual try destroy misery. The little boy much one God's messengers angel flaming sword, going fight devil. The devil fight Misery. And way fought best. Like wise soldier, attacked first weakest point--that baby; Misery never get hold baby grown person. Diamond knowing babies, knew could something make baby, happy; although known one baby yet, although one baby another, yet much alike things, knew one baby thoroughly, good reason believe could something other. I known people would begun fight devil different stupid way. They would begun scolding idiotic cabman; next would make wife angry saying must fault well his, leaving ill-bred though well-meant shabby little books read, sure hate sight of; time would put finger touch wailing baby. But Diamond cradle moment, set knee, told look light. Now light came lamp yard, dingy yellow light, glass lamp dirty, gas bad; light came was, notwithstanding, certainly light come sun itself, baby knew that, smiled it; although indeed wretched room lamp lighted--so dreary, dirty, empty, hopeless!--there middle sat Diamond stool, smiling baby, baby knees smiling lamp. The father sat staring nothing, neither asleep awake, quite lost stupidity either, dimly angry himself, know why. It struck wife. He forgotten it, miserable it, notwithstanding. And misery voice great Love made wife baby Diamond, speaking heart, telling good. For great Love speaks wretched dirty hearts; tone voice depends echoes place sounds. On Mount Sinai, thunder; cabman's heart misery; soul St. John perfect blessedness. By became aware voice singing room. This, course, voice Diamond singing baby--song song, every one foolish another cabman, tipsy part one word another: words mixed ear gurgle without division stop; way spoke himself, horrid condition. But baby content Diamond's songs, Diamond contented songs about, care bit songs themselves, baby liked them. But cabman good well baby Diamond, put sleep, sleep busy time lasted, smoothing wrinkles temper. At length Diamond grew tired singing, began talk baby instead. And soon stopped singing, cabman began wake up. His brain little clearer now, temper little smoother, heart quite dirty. He began listen went listening, heard Diamond saying baby something like this, thought cabman asleep: “Poor daddy! Baby's daddy takes much beer gin, makes somebody else, self all. Baby's daddy would never hit baby's mammy take much beer. He fond baby's mammy, works morning night get breakfast dinner supper, night forgets, pays money away beer. And put nasty stuff beer, I heard daddy say, drives good out, let us bad in. Daddy says man takes drink, thirsty devil creeps inside, knows always get enough there. And devil always crying drink, makes man thirsty, drinks more, till kills it. And ugly devil creeps him, crawls belly, looking cabman get into, may drink, drink, drink. That daddy says, baby. And says, too, way make devil come give plenty cold water tea coffee, nothing comes public-house; devil cannot abide kind stuff, creeps pretty soon, fear drowned it. But daddy drink nasty stuff, poor man! I wish would not, makes mammy cross him, wonder! mammy's cross, crosser, nobody house take care baby; take care them, baby--do you, baby? I know do. Babies always take care fathers mothers--do they, baby? That come for--is it, baby? And daddy stops drinking beer nasty gin turpentine it, father says, mammy happy, look pretty! daddy good baby! baby happy swallow, merriest fellow! And Diamond happy too! And Diamond's man, take baby box, teach drive cab.” He went chatter like till baby asleep, time tired, father mother wide awake--only rather confused--the one beer, blow--and staring, one chair, bed, Diamond. But quite unaware notice, sat half-asleep, eyes wide open, staring turn, though without knowing it, cabman, cabman could withdraw gaze Diamond's white face big eyes. For Diamond's face always rather pale, paler usual sleeplessness, light street-lamp upon it. At length found nodding, knew time put baby down, lest let fall. So rose little three-legged stool, laid baby cradle, covered up--it well warm night, want much covering--and staggered door, tipsy sleep. “Wife,” said cabman, turning towards bed, “I somehow believe wur angel gone. Did see him, wife? He warn't wery big, got none wingses, know. It wur one baby-angels sees gravestones, know.” “Nonsense, hubby!” said wife; “but good. I might say better, ketch hold like. That little Diamond everybody knows, duck diamonds is! No woman could wish better child be.” “I ha' heerd stable, I never see brat afore. Come, old girl, let bygones bygones, gie us kiss, go bed.” The cabman kept cab another yard, although room this. He often late coming home, one take notice children, especially tipsy, oftener not. Hence, ever seen Diamond, know him. But wife knew well enough, every one else lived day yard. She good-natured woman. It got fire lighted tea ready Diamond mother came home Sandwich. And husband ill-natured man either, morning recalled Diamond's visit, behaved wife, vexed himself, gladdened poor wife's heart telling sorry was. And whole week after, go near public-house, hard avoid it, seeing certain rich brewer built one, like trap catch souls bodies in, almost every corner pass way home. Indeed, never quite bad that, though time began really reform. CHAPTER XIX. DIAMOND'S FRIENDS ONE day old Diamond standing nose bag Pall Mall Cockspur Street, master reading newspaper box cab, last good many row, little Diamond got run, legs getting cramped sitting. And first strolled hands pockets crossing, girl broom found weathers. Just going speak her, tall gentleman stepped upon crossing. He pleased find clean, streets muddy, nice boots on; put hand pocket, gave girl penny. But gave sweet smile return, made pretty courtesy, looked again, said: “Where live, child?” “Paradise Row,” answered; “next door Adam Eve--down area.” “Whom live with?” asked. “My wicked old grannie,” replied. “You call grannie wicked,” said gentleman. “But is,” said girl, looking confidently face. “If believe me, come take look her.” The words sounded rude, girl's face looked simple gentleman saw mean rude, became still interested her. “Still say so,” insisted. “Should I? Everybody calls wicked old grannie--even wicked her. You hear swear. There nothing like Row. Indeed, I assure you, sir, never one shut grannie begins gets right a-going. You must put passion first, know. It good till that--she old now. How make laugh, sure!” Although called wicked, child spoke plainly indicate pride grannie's pre-eminence swearing. The gentleman looked grave hear her, sorry nice little girl bad keeping. But know say next, stood moment eyes ground. When lifted them, saw face Diamond looking his. “Please, sir,” said Diamond, “her grannie's cruel sometimes, shuts streets night, happens late.” “Is brother?” asked gentleman girl. “No, sir.” “How know grandmother, then? He look like one sort.” “Oh no, sir! He good boy--quite.” Here tapped forehead finger significant manner. “What mean that?” asked gentleman, Diamond looked smiling. “The cabbies call God's baby,” whispered. “He right head, know. A tile loose.” Still Diamond, though heard every word, understood too, kept smiling. What could matter people called him, long nothing ought do? And, besides, God's baby surely best names! “Well, little man, do?” asked gentleman, turning towards him--just sake saying something. “Drive cab,” said Diamond. “Good; else?” continued; for, accepting girl said, regarded still sweetness Diamond's face sign silliness, wished kind poor little fellow. “Nurse baby,” said Diamond. “Well--and else?” “Clean father's boots, make bit toast tea.” “You useful little man,” said gentleman. “What else do?” “Not much I know of,” said Diamond. “I cannot curry horse, except somebody puts back. So I count that.” “Can read?” “No. But mother father can, going teach day soon.” “Well, penny you.” “Thank you, sir.” “And learned read, come me, I give sixpence book fine pictures it.” “Please, sir, I come?” asked Diamond, much man world know must gentleman's address could go see him. “You silly!” thought he, put hand pocket, brought card. “There,” said, “your father able read that, tell go.” “Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,” said Diamond, put card pocket. The gentleman walked away, turning round paces off, saw Diamond give penny girl, and, walking slower heard say: “I got father, mother, little brother, got nothing wicked old grannie. You may penny.” The girl put beside pocket, trustworthy article dress wore. Her grandmother always took care stout pocket. “Is cruel ever?” asked Diamond. “Much same. But I gets coppers I used to, I get summats eat, take browns enough home besides keep grumbling. It good thing blind, though.” “Why?” asked Diamond. “Because sharp eyes used be, would find I never eats broken wittles, would know I must get something somewheres.” “Does watch you, then?” “OF course do. Do just! But I make believe drop lap, hitch pocket.” “What would found out?” “She never give more.” “But want it!” “Yes, I want it.” “What it, then?” “Give cripple Jim.” “Who cripple Jim?” “A boy Row. His mother broke leg wur kid, never come much; good boy, Jim, I love Jim dearly. I always keeps penny Jim--leastways often I can.--But I must sweep again, busses makes end dirt.” “Diamond! Diamond!” cried father, afraid might get good talking girl; Diamond obeyed, got upon box. He told father gentleman, promised would learn read, showed gentleman's card. “Why, many doors Mews!” said father, giving back card. “Take care it, boy, may lead something. God knows, hard times man wants many friends ever likely get.” “Have got friends enough, father?” asked Diamond. “Well, I right complain; better, know.” “Just let count,” said Diamond. And took hands pockets, spreading fingers left hand, began count, beginning thumb. “There mother, first, baby, me. Next old Diamond--and cab--no, I count cab, never looks you, Diamond's shafts, nobody. Then man drinks next door, wife, baby.” “They friends mine,” said father. “Well, friends mine,” said Diamond. His father laughed. “Much good you!” said. “How know not?” returned Diamond. “Well, go on,” said father. “Then Jack Mr. Stonecrop, and, deary me! mentioned Mr. Coleman Mrs. Coleman, Miss Coleman, Mrs. Crump. And clergyman spoke garden day tree blown down.” “What name!” “I know name.” “Where live?” “I know.” “How count him, then?” “He talk me, kindlike too.” His father laughed again. “Why, child, counting everybody know. That make friends.” “Do it? I thought did. Well, shall friends. I shall make them.” “How that?” “They cannot help then, would. If I choose friend, know, cannot prevent me. Then girl crossing.” “A fine set friends have, sure, Diamond!” “Surely friend anyhow, father. If her, would never got Mrs. Coleman Miss Coleman carry home.” His father silent, saw Diamond right, ashamed find ungrateful thought. “Then new gentleman,” Diamond went on. “If say,” interposed father. “And he? I daresay sixpence much spare. But I quite understand, father: nobody friend one something you?” “No, I say that, boy. You would leave baby then.” “Oh no, I not. Baby laugh face, crow ears, make feel happy. Call nothing, father?” The father's heart fairly touched now. He made answer last appeal, Diamond ended saying: “And best mine come yet--and you, daddy--except mother, know. You friend, daddy, you? And I friend, I?” “And God us all,” said father, silent solemn. CHAPTER XX. DIAMOND LEARNS TO READ THE question tall gentleman whether Diamond could read set father thinking high time could; soon old Diamond suppered bedded, began task night. But much task Diamond, father took lesson-book rhymes mother picked sea-shore; Diamond beginning soon, learned fast indeed. Within month able spell verses himself. But never come upon poem thought heard mother read day. He looked book several times knew letters words, fancying could tell look it, always failed find one like another. So wisely gave search till could really read. Then resolved begin beginning, read straight through. This took nearly fortnight. When almost reached end, came upon following verses, took fancy much, although certainly like search of. LITTLE BOY BLUE Little Boy Blue lost way wood. Sing apples cherries, roses honey; He said, “I would go back I could, It jolly funny.” He sang, “This wood own, Apples cherries, roses honey; So I sit, like king throne, All jolly funny.” A little snake crept tree, Apples cherries, roses honey; “Lie feet, little snake,” said he, All jolly funny. A little bird sang tree overhead, Apples cherries, roses honey; “Come sing song finger instead, All jolly funny.” The snake coiled up; bird flew down, And sang song Birdie Brown. Little Boy Blue found tiresome sit, And thought better walk bit. So got, way take, And said, “Come along, little bird snake.” And waves snake damp leaves passed, And snake went first Birdie Brown last; By Boy Blue's head, flutter dart, Flew Birdie Brown song heart. He came apples grew red sweet: “Tree, drop apple feet.” He came cherries hung plump red: “Come mouth, sweet kisses,” said. And boughs bow down, apples dapple The grass, many grapple. And cheeriest cherries, never miss, Fall mouth, full-grown kiss. He met little brook singing song. He said, “Little brook, going wrong. “You must follow me, follow me, follow, I say Do I tell you, come way.” And song-singing, sing-songing forest brook Leaped bed took, Followed him, followed. And pale wan, The dead leaves rustled water ran. And every bird high bough, And every creature low below, He called, creatures obeyed call, Took legs wings followed all; Squirrels carried tails like sack, Each little humpy brown back; Householder snails, slugs tails, And butterflies, flutterbies, ships sails; And weasels, ousels, mice, larks, And owls, rere-mice, harkydarks, All went running, creeping, flowing, After merry boy fluttering going; The dappled fawns fawning, fallow-deer following, The swallows flies, flying swallowing; Cockchafers, henchafers, cockioli-birds, Cockroaches, henroaches, cuckoos herds. The spider forgot followed spinning, And lost thread end beginning. The gay wasp forgot rings waist, He never made undignified haste. The dragon-flies melted mist hurrying. The mole moleskins left barrowing burrowing. The bees went buzzing, busy beesy, And midges columns upright easy. But Little Boy Blue content, Calling followers still went, Blowing horn, beating drum, And crying aloud, “Come you, come!” He said shadows, “Come me;” And shadows began flicker flee, And flew wood flattering fluttering, Over dead leaves flickering muttering. And said wind, “Come, follow; come, follow, With whistle pipe, rustle hollo.” And wind wound round desire, As gold cock spire. And cock flew church, And left farmers lurch. They run fly, creep come, Everything, everything, some. The trees tugged roots, Only feet fast boots, After leaning straining bending, As boles kept walking wending, Till wood burst lea, Shouting calling, “Come me!” And rose leafy hiss, And stood nothing amiss. Little Boy Blue sat stone, And creatures came round every one. And said clouds, “I want there.” And sank thin blue air. And said sunset far West, “Come here; I want you; I know best.” And sunset came stood wold, And burned glowed purple gold. Then Little Boy Blue began ponder: “What done all, I wonder.” Then Little Boy Blue, said, quite low, “What I sure I know.” Then clouds clodded till dismal grew; The snake sneaked close; round Birdie Brown flew; The brook sat like snake tail; And wind came what-will-you wail; And creatures sat stared; The mole opened eyes glared; And rats bats world wife, Little Boy Blue afraid life. Then Birdie Brown began sing, And sang thing: “You brought us hither, Little Boy Blue, Pray want us do?” “Go away! go away!” said Little Boy Blue; “I sure I want you--get away--do.” “No, no; no, no; no, yes, no, no,” Sang Birdie Brown, “it must so. “We cannot nothing come here, away. Give us work, else stay.” “Oh dear! oh dear!” sob sigh, Said Little Boy Blue, began cry. But got far, thought thing; And stood, spoke like king. “Why hustle jostle bother? Off all! Take back mother.” The sunset stood gates west. “Follow me, follow me” came Birdie Brown's breast. “I going way fast I can,” Said brook, sank turned ran. Back woods fled shadows like ghosts: “If stay, shall missed posts.” Said wind voice changed cheer, “I going there, brought here.” “That I live,” said sack-backed squirrel, And turned sack swing swirl. Said cock spire, “His father's churchwarden.” Said brook running faster, “I run garden.” Said mole, “Two hundred worms--there I caught Last year, I going next autumn.” Said all, “If want us steer for, What earth water bring us for?” “Never mind,” said Little Boy Blue; “That I tell you. If do, “I get once, go home without you. I think I will; I begin doubt you.” He rose; rose snake tail, And hissed three times, half hiss, half wail. Little Boy Blue tried go past him; But wherever turned, sat snake faced him. “If get way,” said, “I tell you, snake, I break head.” The snake neither would go come; So hit hard stick drum. The snake fell dead, And Little Boy Blue set foot head. And creatures marched him, And marshalled home high cockolorum. And Birdie Brown sang Twirrrr twitter twirrrr twee-- Apples cherries, roses honey; Little Boy Blue listened me-- All jolly funny. CHAPTER XXI. SAL'S NANNY DIAMOND managed many blunders read rhyme mother. “Is nice, mother?” said. “Yes, pretty,” answered. “I think means something,” returned Diamond. “I sure I know what,” said. “I wonder boy--yes, must same--Little Boy Blue, know. Let see--how rhyme go? Little Boy Blue, come blow horn-- Yes, course is--for one went `blowing horn beating drum.' He drum too. Little Boy Blue, come blow horn; The sheep's meadow, cow's corn, He keep out, know. But minding work. It goes-- Where little boy looks sheep? He haystack, fast asleep. There, see, mother! And then, let see-- Who go wake him? No, I; For I do, sure cry. So I suppose nobody wake him. He rather cross little boy, I daresay, woke up. And wake himself, saw mischief cow done corn, instead running home mother, ran away wood lost himself. Do think likely, mother?” “I wonder,” answered. “So see naughty; even lost want go home. Any creatures would shown way asked it--all snake. He followed snake, know, took farther away. I suppose young one serpent tempted Adam Eve. Father telling us last Sunday, remember.” “Bless child!” said mother herself; added aloud, finding Diamond go on, “Well, next?” “I know, mother. I sure great deal more, I cannot say. I know killed snake. I suppose drumstick for. He could horn.” “But surely silly take true, Diamond?” “I think must be. It looks true. That killing snake looks true. It I got often.” His mother looked uneasy. Diamond smiled full face, added-- “When baby cries happy, father talk troubles, I mean.” This little reassure mother; lest reader qualms too, I venture remind Diamond back north wind. Finding made reply, Diamond went on-- “In week so, I shall able go tall gentleman tell I read. And I ask help understand rhyme.” But week out, another reason going Mr. Raymond. For three days, which, one time other, Diamond's father stand near National Gallery, girl crossing, Diamond got quite anxious her, fearing must ill. On fourth day, seeing yet, said father, moment shut door cab upon fare-- “Father, I want go look girl, She cannot well.” “All right,” said father. “Only take care yourself, Diamond.” So saying climbed box drove off. He great confidence boy, see, would trust anywhere. But known kind place girl lived, would perhaps thought twice allowed go alone. Diamond, know something it, not, however, fear. From talking girl good notion was, remembered address well enough; asking way twenty times, mostly policemen, came length pretty near place. The last policeman questioned looked upon summit six feet two inches, replied another question, kindly: “What want there, small kid? It bred, I guess.” “No sir” answered Diamond. “I live Bloomsbury.” “That long way off,” said policeman. “Yes, good distance,” answered Diamond; “but I find way pretty well. Policemen always kind me.” “But earth want here?” Diamond told plainly about, course man believed him, nobody ever disbelieved Diamond. People might think mistaken, never thought telling story. “It ugly place,” said policeman. “Is far off?” asked Diamond. “No. It next door almost. But safe.” “Nobody hurts me,” said Diamond. “I must go you, I suppose.” “Oh, no! please not,” said Diamond. “They might think I going meddle them, I not, know.” “Well, please,” said man, gave full directions. Diamond set off, never suspecting policeman, kind-hearted man, children own, following close, watching round every corner. As went on, thought remembered place, whether really so, laid policeman's instructions well mind, went straight cellar old Sal. “He sharp little kid, anyhow, simple looks,” said man himself. “Not wrong turn take! But old Sal's rum un child pay morning visit to. She worse sober half drunk. I seen would torn pieces.” Happily Diamond, old Sal gone get gin. When came door bottom area-stair knocked, received answer. He laid ear door, thought heard moaning within. So tried door, found locked! It dreary place indeed,--and dark, window level street, covered mud, grating kept people falling area, stood chest drawers, placed dealer second-hand furniture, shut almost light. And smell place dreadful. Diamond stood still while, could see next nothing, heard moaning plainly enough now, When got used darkness, discovered friend lying closed eyes white suffering face heap little better rags corner den. He went spoke; made answer. Indeed, least aware presence, Diamond saw could nothing without help. So taking lump barley-sugar pocket, bought came along, laying beside her, left place, already made mind go see tall gentleman, Mr. Raymond, ask something Sal's Nanny, girl called. By time got area-steps, three four women seen go standing together top waiting him. They wanted clothes children; follow lest Sal find there. The moment appeared, laid hands him, began talking once, wanted get advantage neighbours. He told quite quietly, frightened, come see matter Nanny. “What know Nanny?” said one fiercely. “Wait till old Sal comes home, catch it, going prying house out. If give jacket directly, I go fetch her.” “I cannot give jacket,” said Diamond. “It belongs father mother, know. It mine give. Is now? You would think right give away yours--would now?” “Give away! No, I would not; I would keep it,” said, rough laugh. “But jacket yours, right keep it? Here, Cherry, make haste. It one go apiece.” They began tug jacket, Diamond stooped kept arms bent resist them. Before done jacket harm, however, suddenly scampered away; Diamond, looking opposite direction, saw tall policeman coming towards him. “You better let come you, little man,” said, looking Diamond's face, flushed resistance. “You came right time, thank you,” returned Diamond. “They done harm.” “They would I hand, though.” “Yes; hand, know, could not.” Perhaps answer deeper purport either Diamond policeman knew. They walked away together, Diamond telling new friend ill poor Nanny was, going let tall gentleman know. The policeman put nearest way Bloomsbury, stepping good earnest, Diamond reached Mr. Raymond's door less hour. When asked home, servant, return, asked wanted. “I want tell something.” “But I cannot go trouble message that.” “He told come him--that is, I could read--and I can.” “How I know that?” Diamond stared astonishment one moment, answered: “Why, I told you. That know it.” But man made coarser grain policeman, and, instead seeing Diamond could tell lie, put answer impudence, saying, “Do think I going take word it?” shut door face. Diamond turned sat doorstep, thinking tall gentleman must either come come out, therefore best possible position finding him. He waited long door opened again; looked round, servant more. “Get, away” said. “What doorstep?” “Waiting Mr. Raymond,” answered Diamond, getting up. “He home.” “Then I wait till comes,” returned Diamond, sitting smile. What man would done next I know, step sounded hall, Diamond looked round yet again, tall gentleman. “Who this, John?” asked. “I know, sir. An imperent little boy sit doorstep.” “Please sir” said Diamond, “he told home, I sat wait you.” “Eh, what!” said Mr. Raymond. “John! John! This do. Is habit turn away visitors? There one else turn away, I afraid, I find kind thing. Come in, little man. I suppose come claim sixpence?” “No, sir, that.” “What! cannot read yet?” “Yes, I now, little. But I come next time. I came tell Sal's Nanny.” “Who Sal's Nanny?” “The girl crossing talked day.” “Oh, yes; I remember. What matter? Has got run over?” Then Diamond told all. Now Mr. Raymond one kindest men London. He sent horse put brougham, took Diamond him, drove Children's Hospital. There well known everybody, large subscriber, used go tell children stories afternoon. One doctors promised go find Nanny, could done--have brought hospital, possible. That night sent litter her, could use old Sal better, object removed. So soon lying fever ward--for first time life nice clean bed. But knew nothing whole affair. She ill know anything. CHAPTER XXII. MR. RAYMOND'S RIDDLE MR. RAYMOND took Diamond home him, stopping Mews tell mother would send back soon. Diamond ran message himself, reappeared hand torn crumpled book North Wind given him. “Ah! I see,” said Mr. Raymond: “you going claim sixpence now.” “I thinking much another thing,” said Diamond. “There rhyme book I cannot quite understand. I want tell means, please.” “I I can,” answered Mr. Raymond. “You shall read get home, I shall see.” Still good many blunders, Diamond read fashion. Mr. Raymond took little book read again. Now Mr. Raymond poet himself, so, although never back north wind, able understand poem pretty well. But saying anything it, read aloud, Diamond thought understood much better already. “I tell I think means,” said. “It means people may way while, like, get troubles wish it.” “I know, I know!” said Diamond. “Like poor cabman next door. He drinks much.” “Just so,” returned Mr. Raymond. “But people want right, things try help them. Only must kill snake, know.” “I sure snake something it,” cried Diamond triumphantly. A good deal talk followed, Mr. Raymond gave Diamond sixpence. “What it?” asked. “Take home mother,” answered. “She teapot--such black one!--with broken spout, keeps money it. It much; saves buy shoes me. And baby coming famously, want shoes soon. And every sixpence something--are it, sir?” “To sure, man. I hope always make good use money.” “I hope so, sir,” said Diamond. “And book you, full pictures stories poems. I wrote myself, chiefly children hospital I hope Nanny going. I mean I printed it, know. I made it,” added Mr. Raymond, wishing Diamond understand author book. “I know mean. I make songs myself. They awfully silly, please baby, meant for.” “Could let hear one now?” said Mr. Raymond. “No, sir, I could not. I forget soon I done them. Besides, I could make line without baby knee. We make together, know. They much baby's mine. It pulls me.” “I suspect child's genius,” said poet himself, “and makes people think silly.” Now child readers want know genius is--shall I try tell them, shall I not? I give one short answer: means one understands things without body telling mean. God makes teach rest us. “Do like riddles?” asked Mr. Raymond, turning leaves book. “I know riddle is,” said Diamond. “It something means something else, got find something else is.” Mr. Raymond liked old-fashioned riddle best, written few--one read. I one foot, thousands toes; My one foot stands, never goes. I many arms, mighty all; And hundreds fingers, large small. From ends fingers beauty grows. I breathe hair, I drink toes. I grow bigger bigger waist, And yet I always tight laced. None ever saw eat--I mouth bite; Yet I eat day full sunlight. In summer song I shave quiver, But winter I fast groan shiver. “Do know means, Diamond?” asked, finished. “No, indeed, I not,” answered Diamond. “Then read yourself, think it, see find out,” said Mr. Raymond, giving book. “And better go home mother. When found riddle, come again.” If Diamond find riddle order see Mr. Raymond again, I doubt would ever seen him. “Oh then,” I think I hear little reader say, “he could genius, genius finds things without told.” I answer, “Genius finds truths, tricks.” And understand that, I afraid must content wait till grow older know more. CHAPTER XXIII. THE EARLY BIRD WHEN Diamond got home found father home already, sitting fire looking rather miserable, head ached felt sick. He night work late, agreed him, given up, time, taken kind fever. The next day forced keep bed, wife nursed him, Diamond attended baby. If ill, would delightful home; first day Diamond sang songs ever baby, father listened pleasure. But next could bear even Diamond's sweet voice, ill indeed; Diamond took baby room, end quiet games there. If pull bedding floor, matter, kept baby quiet, made bed again, slept baby next night, many nights after. But long father got well, mother's savings gone. She say word hearing husband, lest distress him; one night, could help crying, came Diamond's room father might hear her. She thought Diamond asleep, not. When heard sobbing, frightened, said-- “Is father worse, mother?” “No, Diamond,” answered, well could; “he good bit better.” “Then crying for, mother?” “Because money almost gone,” replied. “O mammy, make think little poem baby I learned North Wind's book to-day. Do remember I bothered words?” “Yes, child,” said mother heedlessly, thinking to-morrow. Diamond began repeated poem, wonderful memory. A little bird sat edge nest; Her yellow-beaks slept sound tops; That day done best, And filled every one little crops. She filled over-full, And hence feeling little dull. “Oh, dear!” sighed, sat head Sunk chest, neck all, While crop stuck like feather bed Turned inside out, rather small; “What shall I things reform? I know single worm. “I twenty to-day, children five each, Besides flies, fat spiders: No one say I I preach-- I one best bird-providers; But use? We want storm-- I know single worm.” “There five crop,” said wee, wee bird, Which woke voice mother's pain; “I know five.” And word He tucked head, went again. “The folly childhood,” sighed mother, “Has always especial bother.” The yellow-beaks slept on-- They never heard bogy To-morrow; But mother sat outside, making moan-- She soon beg, steal, borrow. For never tell night before, Where shall find one red worm more. The fact, I say, was, would many; She could sleep, called virtue, Motherly foresight, affection, Name may call hurt you, So late ere tucked head in, And slept late almost sin. But little fellow knew five Nor troubled head more, Woke early, felt quite alive, And wanted sixth add store: He pushed mother, greedy elf, Then thought better try himself. When mother awoke rubbed eyes, Feeling less like bird, like mole, She saw him--fancy surprise-- Dragging huge worm hole! It Was hero proverb took form: It Is early bird catches worm. “There, mother!” said Diamond, finished; “are funny?” “I wish like little bird, Diamond, could catch worms yourself,” said mother, rose go look husband. Diamond lay awake minutes, thinking could catch worms. It little trouble make mind, however, still less go sleep it. CHAPTER XXIV. ANOTHER EARLY BIRD HE GOT morning soon heard men moving yard. He tucked little brother could tumble bed, went out, leaving door open, cry mother might hear once. When got yard found stable-door opened. “I early bird, I think,” said himself. “I hope I shall catch worm.” He would ask one help him, fearing project might meet disapproval opposition. With great difficulty, help broken chair brought bedroom, managed put harness Diamond. If old horse least objection proceeding, course could done it; even came bridle, opened mouth bit, taking apple Diamond sometimes gave him. He fastened cheek-strap carefully, usual hole, fear choking friend, else letting bit get amongst teeth. It job get saddle on; chair managed it. If old Diamond education physics equal camel, would knelt let put back, could expected him, Diamond creep quite get hold girth. The collar almost worst part business; Diamond could help Diamond. He held head low till little master got turned round, lifted head, shook shoulders. The yoke rather difficult; laid traces horse's neck, weight much him. He got right last, led stable. By time several men watching him, would interfere, anxious see would get various difficulties. They followed far stable-door, stood watching put horse shafts, got one loops, fastened traces, belly-band, breeching, reins. Then got whip. The moment mounted box, men broke hearty cheer delight success. But would let go without general inspection harness; although found right, buckle shifted, never allowed time father ill. The cheer brought mother window, saw little boy setting alone cab gray morning. She tugged window, stiff; could open it, Diamond, great hurry, mews, almost street. She called “Diamond! Diamond!” answer except Jack. “Never fear him, madam,” said Jack. “It 'ud devil would hurt him, many folk 'ud believe. A boy Diamond's size 'arness 'oss t'other Diamond's size, put to, right trivet--if upset keb-- fall feet, madam.” “But upset cab, he, Jack?” “Not he, madam. Leastways go it.” “I know much myself. What mean?” “I mean little likely oldest man stable. How gov'nor to-day, madam?” “A good deal better, thank you,” answered, closing window fear lest husband made anxious news Diamond's expedition. He knew pretty well, however, boy capable of, although quite easy less anxious mother. But evening drew on, anxiety increased, every sound wheels made father raise bed, mother peep window. Diamond resolved go straight cab-stand best known, never crawl fear getting annoyed idlers. Before got across Oxford Street, however, hailed man wanted catch train, great hurry think driver. Having carried King's Cross good time, got good fare return, set great spirits, reached stand safety. He first all. As men arrived greeted kindly, inquired father. “Are afraid old 'oss running away you?” asked one. “No, would run away me,” answered Diamond. “He knows I getting shillings father. Or would run home.” “Well, plucky one, girl's looks!” said man; “and I wish ye luck.” “Thank you, sir,” said Diamond. “I I can. I came old place, see, I knew would let turn here.” In course day one man try cut out, stranger; shout rest raised let see would do, made far ashamed besides, went away crawling. Once, block, policeman came him, asked number. Diamond showed father's badge, saying smile: “Father's ill home, I came cab. There fear me. I drive. Besides, old horse could go alone.” “Just well, I daresay. You pair them. But rum 'un cabby--are now?” said policeman. “I know I ought let go.” “I done nothing,” said Diamond. “It fault I bigger. I big enough age.” “That is,” said man. “You fit.” “How know that?” asked Diamond, usual smile, turning head like little bird. “Why, get ruck now, begins move?” “Just get box,” said Diamond, “and I show you. There, van's a-moving now. Jump up.” The policeman Diamond told him, soon satisfied little fellow could drive. “Well,” said, got again, “I know I right interfere. Good luck you, little man!” “Thank you, sir,” said Diamond, drove away. In minutes gentleman hailed him. “Are driver cab?” asked. “Yes, sir” said Diamond, showing badge, which, proud. “You youngest cabman I ever saw. How I know break bones?” “I would rather break own,” said Diamond. “But afraid, never mind me; I shall soon get another fare.” “I risk it,” said gentleman; and, opening door himself, jumped in. He going good distance, soon found Diamond got ground well. Now Diamond go straight ahead, mind much about, thoughts always turned riddle Mr. Raymond set him; gentleman looked clever fancied must able read him. He given hope finding himself, could plague father ill. He thought answer himself, fancied could right one, see fitted required knowledge physiology. So, reached end journey, got quickly, head looking window, said, gentleman gathered gloves newspapers: “Please, sir, tell meaning riddle?” “You must tell riddle first,” answered gentleman, amused. Diamond repeated riddle. “Oh! easy enough,” returned. “It tree.” “Well, got mouth, sure enough; eat day long?” “It sucks food tiniest holes leaves,” answered. “Its breath food. And cannot except daylight.” “Thank you, sir, thank you,” returned Diamond. “I sorry I could find myself; Mr. Raymond would better pleased me.” “But need tell one told you.” Diamond gave stare came back north wind, kind thing unknown. “That would cheating,” said last. “Are cabby, then?” “Cabbies cheat.” “Do they? I different opinion.” “I sure father not.” “What fare, young innocent?” “Well, I think distance good deal three miles--that two shillings. Only father says sixpence mile little, though cannot ask more.” “You deep one. But I think wrong. It four miles--not much, is.” “Then half-a-crown,” said Diamond. “Well, three shillings. Will do?” “Thank kindly, sir. I tell father good me--first tell riddle, put right distance, give sixpence over. It help father get well again, will.” “I hope may, man. I wonder good look, all.” As Diamond returned, drew stand never before: time give Diamond bag chopped beans oats. The men got him, began chaff him. He took good-humouredly, one them, ill-conditioned fellow, began tease old Diamond poking roughly ribs, making general game him. That could bear, tears came eyes. He undid nose-bag, put boot, going mount drive away, fellow interfered, would let get up. Diamond endeavoured persuade him, civil, would fun him, said. In minutes group idle boys assembled, Diamond found uncomfortable position. Another cab drew stand, driver got approached assemblage. “What here?” asked, Diamond knew voice. It drunken cabman. “Do see young oyster? He pretends drive cab,” said enemy. “Yes, I see him. And I sees too. You would better leave alone. He oyster. He angel come business. You off, I nearer quite agreeable.” The drunken cabman tall, stout man, look one take liberties with. “Oh! friend yours,” said other, drawing back. Diamond got nose-bag again. Old Diamond feed now. “Yes, friend mine. One best I ever had. It pity friend yourn. You would better it, fault hisn.” When Diamond went home night, carried one pound one shilling sixpence, besides coppers extra, followed fares. His mother got anxious indeed--so much almost afraid, hear sound cab, go look, lest yet disappointed, break husband. But old horse, cab right, Diamond box, pale face looking triumphant full moon twilight. When drew stable-door, Jack came out, good many friendly questions congratulations, said: “You go mother, Diamond. I put old 'oss. I take care him. He deserve small attention, do.” “Thank you, Jack,” said Diamond, bounded house, arms mother, waiting top stair. The poor, anxious woman led room, sat bed, took lap baby, cried. “How father?” asked Diamond, almost afraid ask. “Better, child,” answered, “but uneasy you, dear.” “Did tell I early bird gone catch worm?” “That put head, it, monkey?” said mother, beginning get better. “That something else,” answered Diamond, quietly mother held head back stared face. “Well! children!” said, said more. “And worm,” resumed Diamond. But see face poured shillings sixpences pence lap! She burst crying second time, ran money husband. And pleased was! It end good. But counting coins, Diamond turned baby, lying awake cradle, sucking precious thumb, took up, saying: “Baby, baby! I seen whole year.” And began sing usual. And sang this, happy either make song sing sense. It one Mr. Raymond's book. THE TRUE STORY OF THE CAT AND THE FIDDLE Hey, diddle, diddle! The cat fiddle! He played merry tune, That cow went mad With pleasure had, And jumped right moon. But then, see? Before could be, The moon come listened. The little dog hearkened, So loud barkened, “There nothing like it, not.” Hey, diddle, diddle! Went cat fiddle, Hey diddle, diddle, dee, dee! The dog laughed sport Till cough cut short, It hey diddle, diddle, oh me! And back came cow With merry, merry low, For would humbled man moon. The dish got excited, The spoon delighted, And dish waltzed away spoon. But man moon, Coming back soon From famous town Norwich, Caught dish, Said, “It I wish To hold cold plum-porridge!” Gave cow rat-tat, Flung water cat, And sent away like rocket. Said, “O Moon are!” Got car, And went spoon pocket Hey ho! diddle, diddle! The wet cat wet fiddle, They made caterwauling, That cow fright Stood bolt upright Bellowing now, bawling; And dog tail, Stretched neck wail. But “Ho! ho!” said man moon-- “No South Shall I burn mouth, For I found dish spoon.” CHAPTER XXV. DIAMOND'S DREAM “THERE, baby!” said Diamond; “I happy I sing nonsense. Oh, father, think poor man, cab old Diamond! What I done?” “I know indeed could done,” said father bed. “We starved, precious Diamond,” said mother, whose pride boy even greater joy shillings. Both together made heart ache, pleasure well pain. “Oh no! not,” said Diamond. “I could taken Nanny's crossing till came back; money, instead going Old Sal's gin, would gone father's beef-tea. I wonder Nanny gets well again. Somebody else sure taken crossing time. I wonder fight it, whether I shall help her. I bother head that. Time enough yet! Hey diddle! hey diddle! hey diddle diddle! I wonder whether Mr. Raymond would take see Nanny. Hey diddle! hey diddle! hey diddle diddle! The baby fiddle! O, mother, I silly! But I cannot help it. I wish I could think something else, nothing come head hey diddle diddle! cat fiddle! I wonder angels do--when extra happy, know--when driving cabs day taking home money mothers. Do think ever sing nonsense, mother?” “I daresay got sort it,” answered mother, “else would like people.” She thinking twenty-one shillings sixpence, nice dinner would get sick husband next day, angels nonsense, said it. But Diamond found answer right. “Yes, sure,” replied. “They would like people nonsense sometimes. But must pretty nonsense, like silly hey diddle diddle! cat fiddle! I wish I could get head. I wonder angels' nonsense like. Nonsense good thing, it, mother?--a little then; baby, much grown people like cabmen mothers? It like pepper salt goes soup--that it--is it, mother? There baby fast asleep! Oh, nonsense baby is--to sleep much! Shall I put down, mother?” Diamond chattered away. What rose happy little heart ran mouth, father mother good. When went bed, early, tired, may suppose, usual, still thinking nonsense could like angels sang happy sing sense. But coming conclusion fell fast asleep. And wonder, must acknowledged difficult question. That night curious dream I think readers would like told them. They would, least, fond nice dreams I am, enough own. He dreamed running twilight old garden. He thought waiting North Wind, come. So would run back gate, see there. He ran ran. It good long garden dream, dream grown long spread wide gate wanted nowhere. He ran ran, instead coming gate found beautiful country, like country ever before. There trees size; nothing bigger fact hawthorns, full may-blossom. The place grew wild dry, mostly covered grass, patches heath. It extended every side far could see. But although wild, yet wherever ordinary heath might expected furze bushes, holly, broom, grew roses--wild rare--all kinds. On every side, far near, roses glowing. There gum-cistus, whose flowers fall every night come next morning, lilacs syringas laburnums, many shrubs besides, know names; roses everywhere. He wandered on, wondering would come end. It use going back, house seen anywhere. But frightened, know Diamond used things rather way. He threw rose-bush, fell asleep. He woke, dream, it, thinking heard child's voice, calling “Diamond, Diamond!” He jumped up, still him. The rose-bushes pouring odours clouds. He could see scent like mists colour rose, issuing like slow fountain spreading air till joined thin rosy vapour hung wilderness. But came voice calling him, seemed come head. He looked up, saw deep blue sky full stars--more brilliant, however, seen before; sky stars looked nearer earth. While gazed up, heard cry. At moment saw one biggest stars head give kind twinkle jump, went came again. He threw back, fixed eyes upon it. Nor gazed long went out, leaving something like scar blue. But went gazing saw face star been--a merry face, bright eyes. The eyes appeared see Diamond, know Diamond caught sight them, face withdrew moment. Again came voice, calling “Diamond, Diamond;” jumped star place. Diamond called loud could, right sky: “Here Diamond, you. What want do?” The next instant many stars round one went out, many voices shouted sky,-- “Come up; come up. We jolly! Diamond! Diamond!” This followed peal merriest, kindliest laughter, stars jumped places again. “How I come up?” shouted Diamond. “Go round rose-bush. It got foot it,” said first voice. Diamond got once, walked side rose-bush. There found seemed opposite wanted--a stair earth. It turf moss. It seem promise well getting sky, Diamond learned look look things. The voice must meant go stair; stair Diamond went, without waiting think it. It nice stair, cool soft--all sides well steps grown moss grass ferns! Down Diamond went--a long way, last heard gurgling splashing little stream; gone much farther met it--yes, met coming stairs meet him, running naturally thing. Neither Diamond least surprised see pitching one step another climbed towards him: never thought odd--and was, there. It would odd here. It made merry tune came, voice like laughter heard sky. This appeared promising; went on, stair, stream, till last came hurried stone, stair stopped altogether. And stream bubbled up, stone shook swayed force; Diamond thought would try lift it. Lightly rose hand, forced stream below; and, would seemed unaccountable perversion things awake, threatened come tumbling upon head. But avoided it, fell, got upon it. He saw opening water came pouring head, help stone scrambled it, found side grassy hill rounded away every direction, came brook vanished hole. But scarcely noticed much merry shouting laughter burst upon him, number naked little boys came running, every one eager get first. At shoulders fluttered two little wings, use flying, mere buds; made could help fluttering flying. Just foremost troop reached him, one two fell, rest shouts laughter came tumbling till heaped mound struggling merriment. One another extricated themselves, got free threw arms round Diamond kissed him. Diamond's heart ready melt within clear delight. When embraced him,-- “Now let us fun,” cried one, shout scampered hither thither, played wildest gambols grassy slopes. They kept constantly coming back Diamond, however, centre enjoyment, rejoicing found lost playmate. There wind hillside blew like embodiment living gladness. It blew Diamond's heart, made happy forced sit cry. “Now let us go dig stars,” said one seemed captain troop. They scurried away, soon returned, one another, pickaxe shoulder spade hand. As soon gathered, captain led straight line another part hill. Diamond rose followed. “Here begin lesson to-night,” said. “Scatter dig.” There fun. Each went himself, walking slowly bent shoulders eyes fixed ground. Every one would stop, kneel down, look intently, feeling hands parting grass. One would get walk again, another spring feet, catch eagerly pickaxe strike ground again, throw aside, snatch spade, commence digging loosened earth. Now one would sorrowfully shovel earth hole again, trample little bare white feet, walk on. But another would give joyful shout, much tugging loosening would draw hole lump big head, bigger fist; side would pour blaze golden bluish light Diamond's eyes quite dazzled. Gold blue commoner colours: jubilation greater red green purple. And every time star dug little angels dropped tools crowded it, shouting dancing fluttering wing-buds. When examined well, would kneel one peep hole; always stood back give Diamond first look. All diamond could report, however, was, star-holes saw great many things places people knew quite well, somehow different--there something marvellous them--he could tell what. Every time rose looking star-hole, felt heart would break for, joy; said cried, know would become him. As soon looked, star carefully fitted again, little mould strewn it, rest heap left sign star discovered. At length one dug small star lovely colour--a colour Diamond never seen before. The moment angel saw was, instead showing about, handed one neighbours, seated edge hole, saying: “This me. Good-bye. I off.” They crowded him, hugging kissing him; stood back solemn stillness, wings lying close shoulders. The little fellow looked round smile, shot headlong star-hole. Diamond, privileged, threw ground peep him, saw nothing. “It use,” said captain. “I never saw anything one went way.” “His wings cannot much use,” said Diamond, concerned fearful, yet comforted calm looks rest. “That true,” said captain. “He lost time. They go way. You got any, see.” “No,” said Diamond. “I never any.” “Oh! you?” said captain. “Some people say,” added, pause, “that come again. I know. I never found colour I care myself. I suppose I shall day.” Then looked star, put carefully hole, danced around it--but solemnly, called name finder. “Will know again?” asked Diamond. “Oh, yes. We never forget star made door of.” Then went searching digging. Diamond neither pickaxe spade, time think. “I see little girls,” said last. The captain stopped shovelling, leaned spade, rubbed forehead thoughtfully left hand--the little angels left-handed--repeated words “little girls,” then, thought struck him, resumed work, saying-- “I think I know mean. I never seen them, course; I suppose sort mean. I told--but mind I say so, I know--that fall asleep, troop angels like ourselves, quite different, goes round stars discovered, discovers us. I suppose shovelling handling spoil bit; I daresay clouds come make smoky dull sometimes. They say--mind, I say say--these angels take one one, pass round do, breathe it, rub white hands, softer ours, pick-and-spade work, smile it, put again: keeps growing dark.” “How jolly!” thought Diamond. “I like see work too.--When go sleep?” asked captain. “When grow sleepy,” answered captain. “They say--but mind I say say--that others--what call them? I know name; I guessing may sort mean--when rounds come near troop us fall asleep. They live west side hill. None us ever top yet.” Even spoke, dropped spade. He tumbled beside it, lay fast asleep. One troop dropped pickaxe shovel listless hands, lay fast asleep work. “Ah!” thought Diamond himself, delight, “now girl-angels coming, I, angel, shall fall asleep like rest, I shall see girl-angels.” But moment felt growing sleepy. He struggled hard invading power. He put fingers eyelids pulled open. But use. He thought saw glimmer pale rosy light far green hill, ceased know. When awoke, angels starting wide awake too. He expected see lift tools, no, time play come. They looked happier ever, began sing stood. He heard sing before. “Now,” thought, “I shall know kind nonsense angels sing merry. They drive cabs, I see, dig stars, work hard enough merry it.” And hear angels' nonsense; sense them, much sense Diamond made good nonsense it. He tried hard set mind, listening closely could, one, another, together. But yet singing began, dismay, find coming awake--faster faster. And came awake, found that, goodness memory, verse verse angels' nonsense vanished it. He always thought could keep last, next began lost one it, length awoke, struggling keep hold last verse all. He felt effort keep forgetting one verse vanishing song nearly killed him. And yet time wide awake could sure even. It something like this: White hands whiteness Wash stars' faces, Till glitter, glitter, glit, goes brightness Down poor places. This, however, near sense thought could really sing. CHAPTER XXVI. DIAMOND TAKES A FARE THE WRONG WAY RIGHT THE next morning Diamond almost early before. He nothing fear mother now, made secret about. By time reached stable, several men there. They asked good many questions luck day before, told wanted know. But proceeded harness old horse, pushed aside rough kindness, called baby, began him. So Diamond ran another mouthful tea bread butter; although never tired night before, started quite fresh morning. It cloudy day, wind blew hard north--so hard sometimes that, perched box toes touching ground, Diamond wished kind strap fasten lest blown away. But really mind it. His head full dream dreamed; make neglect work, work dig stars drive old Diamond pick fares. There many people think beautiful things common work time. But many people back north wind. There much business doing. And Diamond felt rather cold, notwithstanding mother put comforter helped greatcoat. But well aware dignity get inside cab do. A cabman ought minding weather--at least Diamond thought. At length called neighbouring house, young woman heavy box taken Wapping coast-steamer. He find pleasant, far east near river; roughs great force. However, block, even Nightingale Lane, reached entrance wharf, set passenger without annoyance. But turned go back, idlers, content chaffing him, showed mind fare young woman given him. They pulling box, Diamond shouting police, pale-faced man, shabby clothes, look gentleman somewhere him, came up, making good use stick, drove off. “Now, little man,” said, “get can. Do lose time. This place you.” But Diamond habit thinking himself. He saw new friend looked weary, ill, poor. “Will jump in, sir?” said. “I take wherever like.” “Thank you, man; I money; I cannot.” “Oh! I want money. I shall much happier get in. You saved I had. I owe lift, sir.” “Which way going?” “To Charing Cross; I mind I go.” “Well, I tired. If take Charing Cross, I shall greatly obliged you. I walked Gravesend, hardly penny left get tunnel.” So saying, opened door got in, Diamond drove away. But drove, could help fancying seen gentleman--for Diamond knew gentleman--before. Do could, however, could recall when. Meantime fare, may call such, seeing pay nothing, relief carried made less less inclined carry himself, turning things mind, and, passed Mint, called Diamond, stopped horse, got went window. “If mind taking Chiswick, I able pay got there. It long way, shall whole fare Docks--and something over.” “Very well, sir” said Diamond. “I shall happy.” He clambering again, gentleman put head window said-- “It The Wilderness--Mr. Coleman's place; I direct come neighbourhood.” It flashed upon Diamond was. But got upon box arrange thoughts making reply. The gentleman Mr. Evans, Miss Coleman married, Diamond seen several times garden. I said behaved well Miss Coleman. He put marriage cowardly fashion, merely ashamed marry upon small income, live humble way. When man thinks people say case, may love, love poor affair. Mr. Coleman took firm junior partner, measure influence entered upon speculations ruined him. So love blessing. The ship North Wind sunk last venture, Mr. Evans gone hope turning cargo best advantage. He one single boat-load managed reach desert island, gone great many hardships sufferings since then. But past taught, troubles done end good, made doubt himself, begin think, come see foolish well wicked. For, Miss Coleman desert island, build hut, hunt food, make clothes her, would thought fortunate men; home, would marry till could afford man-servant. Before got home again, even begun understand man make haste rich without going God, case one frightful thing successful. So come back humble man, longing ask Miss Coleman forgive him. But idea ruin fallen upon them, never made thoroughly acquainted firm's affairs. Few speculative people know affairs. Hence never doubted find matters much left them, expected see The Wilderness before. But fallen Diamond, would thought going first. What Diamond do? He heard father mother drop remarks concerning Mr. Evans made doubtful him. He understood considerate might been. So went rather slowly till make mind. It was, course, use drive Mr. Evans Chiswick. But tell befallen them, lived now, might put going see them, certain Miss Coleman, least, must want much see Mr. Evans. He pretty sure also best thing case bring together, let set matters right themselves. The moment came conclusion, changed course westward northward, went straight Mr. Coleman's poor little house Hoxton. Mr. Evans tired much occupied thoughts take least notice streets passed through, suspicion, therefore, change direction. By time wind increased almost hurricane, often head it, joke either Diamonds. The distance, however, great. Before reached street Mr. Coleman lived blew tremendously, Miss Coleman, going little way, opened door, dashed wall bang, afraid venture, went again. In five minutes after, Diamond drew door. As soon entered street, however, wind blew right behind them, pulled up, old Diamond much ado stop cab it, breeching broke. Young Diamond jumped box, knocked loudly door, turned cab said--before Mr. Evans quite begun think something must amiss: “Please, sir, harness given away. Would mind stepping minutes? They friends mine. I take like I got mended. I shall many minutes, cannot stand wind.” Half stupid fatigue want food, Mr. Evans yielded boy's suggestion, walked door maid held difficulty wind. She took Mr. Evans visitor, indeed was, showed room ground-floor. Diamond, followed hall, whispered closed door-- “Tell Miss Coleman. It Miss Coleman wants see.” “I know” said maid. “He look much like gentleman.” “He is, though; I know him, Miss Coleman.” The maid could remember Diamond, seen father brought ladies home. So believed him, went told her. What passed little parlour Miss Coleman came belong story, Diamond. If known Miss Coleman thought Mr. Evans dead, perhaps would managed differently. There cry running fro house, quiet again. Almost soon Mr. Evans went in, wind began cease, still. Diamond found making breeching little tighter quite comfortable old horse could well present; and, thinking better let bag quiet place, sat box till old horse eaten dinner. In little Mr. Evans came out, asked come in. Diamond obeyed, delight Miss Coleman put arms round kissed him, payment him! Not mention five precious shillings gave him, could refuse mother wanted much home father. He left nearly happy themselves. The rest day better, and, although much take home day before, yet whole result satisfactory. And story tell father mother adventures, done, result! They asked multitude questions! could answer, could answer; father seemed ever much better finding boy already useful family useful people, quite taking place man judged wise, work worth doing. For fortnight Diamond went driving cab, keeping family. He begun known parts London, people would prefer taking cab liked heard him. One gentleman lived near mews engaged carry City every morning certain hour; Diamond punctual clockwork--though effect required good deal care, father's watch much depended on, watched clock St. George's church. Between two, however, make success it. After fortnight, father able go again. Then Diamond went make inquiries Nanny, led something else. CHAPTER XXVII. THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL THE first day father resumed work, Diamond went usual. In afternoon, however, father, taken fare neighbourhood, went home, Diamond drove cab rest day. It hard old Diamond work, could afford another horse. They contrived save much possible, fed well, bravely. The next morning father much stronger Diamond thought might go ask Mr. Raymond take see Nanny. He found home. His servant grown friendly time, showed without cross-questioning. Mr. Raymond received usual kindness, consented once, walked Hospital, close hand. It comfortable old-fashioned house, built reign Queen Anne, day, doubt, inhabited rich fashionable people: home poor sick children, carefully tended love's sake. There regions London hospital every street might full children, whose fathers mothers dead, unable take care them. When Diamond followed Mr. Raymond room children got worst illness growing better lay, saw number little iron bedsteads, heads walls, every one child, whose face story itself. In some, health begun appear tinge upon cheeks, doubtful brightness eyes, cold dreary winter spring comes blushing buds bright crocuses. In others signs winter left. Their faces reminded snow keen cutting winds, sunshine soft breezes butterflies; even signs suffering told suffering less, spring-time arrived, yet arrived. Diamond looked round, could see Nanny. He turned Mr. Raymond question eyes. “Well?” said Mr. Raymond. “Nanny's here,” said Diamond. “Oh, yes, is.” “I see her.” “I do, though. There is.” He pointed bed right front Diamond standing. “That Nanny,” said. “It Nanny. I seen many times since have. Illness makes great difference.” “Why, girl must back north wind!” thought Diamond, said nothing, stared; stared, something old Nanny began dawn face new Nanny. The old Nanny, though good girl, friendly girl, rough, blunt speech, dirty person. Her face would always reminded one already back north wind something seen best company, coarse notwithstanding, partly weather, partly living amongst low people, partly defend herself: sweet, gentle, refined, might lady gentleman father mother. And Diamond could help thinking words heard church day before: “Surely good afflicted;” something like that. North Wind, somehow other, must her! She grown rough girl gentle maiden. Mr. Raymond, however, surprised, used see lovely changes--something like change passes upon crawling, many-footed creature, turns sick ill, revives butterfly, two wings instead many feet. Instead take care herself, kind hands ministered her, making comfortable sweet clean, soothing aching head, giving cooling drink thirsty; kind eyes, stars kingdom heaven, shone upon her; that, fire fever dew tenderness, coarse melted away, whole face grown refined sweet Diamond know her. But gazed, best old face, true good part it, Nanny herself, dawned upon him, like moon coming cloud, length, instead believing Mr. Raymond she, saw Nanny indeed--very worn grown beautiful. He went her. She smiled. He heard laugh, never seen smile before. “Nanny, know me?” said Diamond. She smiled again, question amusing. She likely forget him; although yet know got there, dreamed often, talked much delirious. Nor much wonder, boy except Joe ever shown kindness. Meantime Mr. Raymond going bed bed, talking little people. Every one knew him, every one eager look, smile, kind word him. Diamond sat stool head Nanny's bed. She laid hand his. No one else old acquaintance near her. Suddenly little voice called aloud-- “Will Mr. Raymond tell us story?” “Oh, yes, please do! please do!” cried several little voices also stronger rest. For Mr. Raymond habit telling story went see them, enjoyed far nice things doctor permitted give them. “Very well,” said Mr. Raymond, “I will. What sort story shall be?” “A true story,” said one little girl. “A fairy tale,” said little boy. “Well,” said Mr. Raymond, “I suppose, difference, I may choose. I cannot think true story moment, I tell sort fairy one.” “Oh, jolly!” exclaimed little boy called fairy tale. “It came head morning I got bed,” continued Mr. Raymond; “and turns pretty well, I write down, get somebody print me, shall read like.” “Then nobody ever heard before?” asked one older child. “No, nobody.” “Oh!” exclaimed several, thinking grand first telling; I daresay might peculiar freshness it, everything would nearly new story-teller listeners. Some sitting lying down, could busy gathering, bustling, shifting fro children generally prepare hear story; faces, turning heads, many feeble exclamations expected pleasure, showed preparations making within them. Mr. Raymond stood middle room, might turn side side, give share seeing him. Diamond kept place Nanny's side, hand his. I know much Mr. Raymond's story smaller children understood; indeed, I quite know much understood, story every one take get. But listened apparent satisfaction, certainly great attention. Mr. Raymond wrote afterwards, is--somewhat altered doubt, good story-teller tries make stories better every time tells them. I cannot help thinking somewhat indebted one old story The Sleeping Beauty. CHAPTER XXVIII. LITTLE DAYLIGHT NO HOUSE pretension called palace least worthy name, except wood near it--very near it--and nearer better. Not round it--I mean that, palace ought open sun wind, stand high brave, weathercocks glittering flags flying; one side every palace must wood. And grand wood indeed beside palace king going Daylight's father; grand wood, nobody yet ever got end it. Near house kept trim nice, free brushwood long way in; degrees got wild, grew wilder, wilder, wilder, said wild beasts last liked it. The king courtiers often hunted, however, kept wild beasts far away palace. One glorious summer morning, wind sun together, vanes flashing flags frolicking blue sky, little Daylight made appearance somewhere--nobody could tell where--a beautiful baby, bright eyes might come sun, showed lively ways might equally well come wind. There great jubilation palace, first baby queen had, much happiness new baby palace cottage. But one disadvantage living near wood: know quite neighbours may be. Everybody knew several fairies, living within miles palace, always something new baby came; fairies live much longer we, business good many generations human mortals. The curious houses lived well known also,--one, hollow oak; another, birch-tree, though nobody could ever find fairy made house it; another, hut growing trees intertwined, patched turf moss. But another fairy lately come place, nobody even knew fairy except fairies. A wicked old thing was, always concealing power, disagreeable could, order tempt people give offence, might pleasure taking vengeance upon them. The people thought witch, knew sight careful avoid offending her. She lived mud house, swampy part forest. In history find fairies give remarkable gifts prince princess, child sufficient importance eyes, always christening. Now understand, ancient custom amongst human beings well; hard explain wicked fairies choose time unkind things; difficult understand able them, would fancy wicked creatures would powerless occasion. But I never knew interference part wicked fairy turn good thing end. What good thing, instance, one princess sleep hundred years! Was saved plague young men worthy her? And come awake exactly right moment right prince kissed her? For part, I cannot help wishing good many girls would sleep till fate overtook them. It would happier them, agreeable friends. Of course known fairies invited christening. But king queen never thought inviting old witch. For power fairies nature; whereas witch gets power wickedness. The fairies, however, knowing danger thus run, provided well could accidents quarter. But could neither render powerless, could arrange gifts reference beforehand, could tell might be. Of course old hag without asked. Not asked wanted, might sort reason wished do. For somehow even wickedest creatures likes pretext wrong thing. Five fairies one given child gifts counted best, fifth stepped back place surrounding splendour ladies gentlemen, when, mumbling laugh toothless gums, wicked fairy hobbled middle circle, moment archbishop handing baby lady head nursery department state affairs, addressed thus, giving bite two every word could part it: “Please Grace, I deaf: would Grace mind repeating princess's name?” “With pleasure, good woman,” said archbishop, stooping shout ear: “the infant's name little Daylight.” “And little daylight shall be,” cried fairy, tone dry axle, “and little good shall gifts her. For I bestow upon gift sleeping day long, whether not. Ha, ha! He, he! Hi, hi!” Then started sixth fairy, who, course, others arranged come wicked one, order undo much might. “If sleep day,” said, mournfully, “she shall, least, wake night.” “A nice prospect mother me!” thought poor king; loved far much give nurses, especially night, kings queens do--and sorry afterwards. “You spoke I done,” said wicked fairy. “That law. It gives another chance.” “I beg pardon,” said fairies, together. “She did. I done laughing,” said crone. “I got Hi, hi! I go Ho, ho! Hu, hu! So I decree wakes night shall wax wane mistress, moon. And may mean I hope royal parents live see. Ho, ho! Hu, hu!” But stepped another fairy, wise enough keep two reserve, every fairy knew trick one. “Until,” said seventh fairy, “a prince comes shall kiss without knowing it.” The wicked fairy made horrid noise like angry cat, hobbled away. She could pretend finished speech time, laughed Ho, ho! Hu, hu! “I know means,” said poor king seventh fairy. “Do afraid. The meaning come thing itself,” said she. The assembly broke up, miserable enough--the queen, least, prepared good many sleepless nights, lady head nursery department anything comfortable prospect her, course queen could all. As king, made mind, courage could summon, meet demands case, wondered whether could propriety require First Lord Treasury take share burden laid upon him. I attempt describe go time. But last household settled regular system--a irregular one respects. For certain seasons palace rang night bursts laughter little Daylight, whose heart old fairy's curse could reach; Daylight still, little wrong place, always dropped asleep first hint dawn east. But merriment short duration. When moon full, glorious spirits, beautiful possible child age be. But moon waned, faded, last wan withered like poorest, sickliest child might come upon streets great city arms homeless mother. Then night quiet day, little creature lay gorgeous cradle night day hardly motion, indeed last without even moan, like one dead. At first often thought dead, last got used it, consulted almanac find moment would begin revive, which, course, first appearance silver thread crescent moon. Then would move lips, would give little nourishment; would grow better better better, days splendidly well. When well, always merriest moonlight; even near worst, seemed better when, warm summer nights, carried cradle light waning moon. Then sleep would smile faintest, pitiful smile. For long time people ever saw awake. As grew older became favourite, however, palace always would contrive keep awake night, order near her. But soon began take every chance getting away nurses enjoying moonlight alone. And thus things went nearly seventeen years age. Her father mother time got used odd state things ceased wonder them. All arrangements reference state Princess Daylight, amazing things contrive accommodate themselves. But prince ever find deliver her, appeared inconceivable. As grew older grown beautiful, sunniest hair loveliest eyes heavenly blue, brilliant profound sky June day. But much painful sad change bad time came on. The beautiful full moon, withered worn become moon waned. At time story arrived, looked, moon small gone, like old woman exhausted suffering. This painful appearance unnatural; hair eyes change. Her wan face drawn wrinkled, eager hungry look. Her skinny hands moved wishing, unable, lay hold something. Her shoulders bent forward, chest went in, stooped eighty years old. At last put bed, await flow tide life. But grew dislike seen, still touched hands, season. One lovely summer evening, moon lay gone upon verge horizon, vanished attendants, searching long time great terror, found fast asleep forest, foot silver birch, carried home. A little way palace great open glade, covered greenest softest grass. This favourite haunt; full moon shone free glorious, vista trees could generally see less dying moon crossed opening. Here little rustic house built her, mostly resided. None court might go without leave, attendants learned time officious waiting upon her, much liberty. Whether good fairies anything I cannot tell, last got way retreating wood every night moon waned, sometimes great trouble finding her; always angry discovered watching her, scarcely dared so. At length one night thought lost altogether. It morning found her. Feeble was, wandered thicket long way glade, lay--fast asleep, course. Although fame beauty sweetness gone abroad, yet everybody knew bad spell, king neighbourhood desire daughter-in-law. There serious objections relation. About time neighbouring kingdom, consequence wickedness nobles, insurrection took place upon death old king, greater part nobility massacred, young prince compelled flee life, disguised like peasant. For time, got country, suffered much hunger fatigue; got ruled princess's father, longer fear recognised, fared better, people kind. He abandon disguise, however. One tolerable reason clothes put on, another little money, know get more. There good telling everybody met prince, felt prince ought able get like people, else rank made fool him. He read princes setting upon adventure; similar case, without choice matter. He would go on, see would come it. For day two walking palace-wood, next nothing eat, came upon strangest little house, inhabited nice, tidy, motherly old woman. This one good fairies. The moment saw knew quite well going come it; liberty interfere orderly march events. She received kindness would shown traveller, gave bread milk, thought delicious food ever tasted, wondering dinner palace sometimes. The old woman pressed stay night. When awoke amazed find well strong felt. She would take money offered, begged him, found occasion continuing neighbourhood, return occupy quarters. “Thank much, good mother,” answered prince; “but little chance that. The sooner I get wood better.” “I know that,” said fairy. “What mean?” asked prince. “Why, I know?” returned she. “I cannot tell,” said prince. “Very well,” said fairy. “How strangely talk!” said prince. “Do I?” said fairy. “Yes, do,” said prince. “Very well,” said fairy. The prince used spoken fashion, felt little angry, turned walked away. But offend fairy. She stood door little house looking till trees hid quite. Then said “At last!” went in. The prince wandered wandered, got nowhere. The sun sank sank went sight, seemed nearer end wood ever. He sat fallen tree, ate bit bread old woman given him, waited moon; for, although much astronomer, knew moon would rise time, risen night before. Up came, slow slow, good size, pretty nearly round indeed; whereupon, greatly refreshed piece bread, got went--he knew whither. After walking considerable distance, thought coming outside forest; reached thought last it, found upon edge great open space it, covered grass. The moon shone bright, thought never seen lovely spot. Still looked dreary loneliness, could see house side. He sat down, weary again, gazed glade. He seen much room several days. All spied something middle grass. What could be? It moved; came nearer. Was human creature, gliding across--a girl dressed white, gleaming moonshine? She came nearer nearer. He crept behind tree watched, wondering. It must strange wood--a nymph moonlight warm dusky air enticed tree. But came close stood, longer doubted human--for caught sight sunny hair, clear blue eyes, loveliest face form ever seen. All began singing like nightingale, dancing music, eyes ever turned towards moon. She passed close stood, dancing edge trees away great circle towards side, could see spot white yellowish green moonlit grass. But feared would vanish quite, spot grew, became figure more. She approached again, singing dancing, waving arms head, completed circle. Just opposite tree stood, ceased song, dropped arms, broke long clear laugh, musical brook. Then, tired, threw grass, lay gazing moon. The prince almost afraid breathe lest startle her, vanish sight. As venturing near her, never came head. She lain long hour longer, prince began doubt concerning her. Perhaps vision fancy. Or spirit wood, all? If so, would haunt wood, glad lost kingdom everything hope near her. He would build hut forest, would live pure chance seeing again. Upon nights like least would come bask moonlight, make soul blessed. But thus dreamed sprang feet, turned face full moon, began singing would draw sky power entrancing voice. She looked beautiful ever. Again began dancing music, danced away distance. Once returned similar manner; although watching eagerly before, fatigue gazing, fell fast asleep came near him. When awoke broad daylight, princess nowhere. He could leave place. What come next night! He would gladly endure day's hunger see yet again: would buckle belt quite tight. He walked round glade see could discover prints feet. But grass short, steps light, left single trace behind her. He walked half-way round wood without seeing anything account presence. Then spied lovely little house, thatched roof low eaves, surrounded exquisite garden, doves peacocks walking it. Of course must gracious lady loved moonlight lived. Forgetting appearance, walked towards door, determined make inquiries, passed little pond full gold silver fishes, caught sight turned find door kitchen. There knocked, asked piece bread. The good-natured cook brought in, gave excellent breakfast, prince found nothing worse served kitchen. While ate, talked entertainer, learned favourite retreat Princess Daylight. But learned nothing more, afraid seeming inquisitive, cook choose heard talking mistress peasant lad begged breakfast. As rose take leave, occurred might far old woman's cottage thought, asked cook whether knew anything place, describing well could. She said knew well enough, adding smile-- “It going, it?” “Yes, far off.” “It three miles. But mind about, know.” “Why say that?” “If mischief, make repent it.” “The best thing could happen circumstances,” remarked prince. “What mean that?” asked cook. “Why, stands reason,” answered prince “that wish anything wrong, best thing made repent it.” “I see,” said cook. “Well, I think may venture. She good old soul.” “Which way lie here?” asked prince. She gave full instructions; left many thanks. Being refreshed, however, prince go back cottage day: remained forest, amusing best could, waiting anxiously night, hope princess would appear. Nor disappointed, for, directly moon rose, spied glimmering shape far across glade. As drew nearer, saw indeed--not dressed white before: pale blue like sky, looked lovelier still. He thought blue suited yet better white; know really beautiful moon nearer full. In fact next night full moon, princess would zenith loveliness. The prince feared time coming near hiding-place night; circles dance ever widened moon rose, last embraced whole glade, came still closer trees hiding come night before. He entranced loveliness, indeed marvellous thing. All night long watched her, dared go near her. He would ashamed watching too, become almost incapable thinking anything beautiful was. He watched whole night long, saw moon went retreated smaller smaller circles, last could see more. Weary was, set old woman's cottage, arrived time breakfast, shared him. He went bed, slept many hours. When awoke sun down, departed great anxiety lest lose glimpse lovely vision. But, whether machinations swamp-fairy, merely one thing go another return road, lost way. I shall attempt describe misery moon rose, saw nothing trees, trees, trees. She high heavens reached glade. Then indeed troubles vanished, princess coming dancing towards him, dress shone like gold, shoes glimmered grass like fireflies. She course still beautiful before. Like embodied sunbeam passed him, danced away distance. Before returned circle, clouds begun gather moon. The wind rose, trees moaned, lighter branches leaned one way it. The prince feared princess would go in, see night. But came dancing jubilant ever, golden dress sunny hair streaming upon blast, waving arms towards moon, exuberance delight ordering clouds away face. The prince could hardly believe creature elements, all. By time completed another circle, clouds gathered deep, growlings distant thunder. Just passed tree stood, flash lightning blinded moment, saw again, horror, princess lay ground. He darted her, thinking struck; heard coming, feet moment. “What want?” asked. “I beg pardon. I thought--the lightning” said prince, hesitating. “There nothing matter,” said princess, waving rather haughtily. The poor prince turned walked towards wood. “Come back,” said Daylight: “I like you. You told. Are good?” “Not good I like be,” said prince. “Then go grow better,” said princess. Again disappointed prince turned went. “Come back,” said princess. He obeyed, stood waiting. “Can tell sun like?” asked. “No,” answered. “But good asking know?” “But I know,” rejoined. “Why, everybody knows.” “That thing: I everybody. I never seen sun.” “Then cannot know like till see it.” “I think must prince,” said princess. “Do I look like one?” said prince. “I cannot quite say that.” “Then think so?” “Because told speak truth.--Is sun bright?” “As bright lightning.” “But go like that, it?” “Oh, no. It shines like moon, rises sets like moon, much shape moon, bright cannot look moment.” “But I would look it,” said princess. “But could not,” said prince. “But I could,” said princess. “Why you, then?” “Because I cannot.” “Why cannot you?” “Because I cannot wake. And I never shall wake until----” Here hid face hands, turned away, walked slowest, stateliest manner towards house. The prince ventured follow little distance, turned made repellent gesture, which, like true gentleman-prince, obeyed once. He waited long time, come near again, night cleared, set last old woman's cottage. It long past midnight reached it, but, surprise, old woman paring potatoes door. Fairies fond odd things. Indeed, however may dissemble, night always day. And fairy blood them. “Why, there, time night, mother?” said prince; kind way young man country would address woman much older himself. “Getting supper ready, son,” answered. “Oh, I want supper,” said prince. “Ah! seen Daylight,” said she. “I seen princess never saw it,” said prince. “Do like her?” asked fairy. “Oh! I?” said prince. “More would believe, mother.” “A fairy believe anything ever ever could be,” said old woman. “Then fairy?” asked prince. “Yes,” said she. “Then things believe?” asked prince. “There plenty them--everything never ever could be.” “Plenty, I grant you,” said prince. “But believe could princess never saw daylight? Do believe now?” This prince said, doubted princess, wanted fairy tell more. She old fairy, however, caught easily. “Of people, fairies must tell secrets. Besides, princess.” “Well, I tell secret. I prince.” “I know that.” “How know it?” “By curl third eyelash left eyelid.” “Which corner count from?” “That secret.” “Another secret? Well, least, I prince, harm telling princess.” “It princes I cannot tell.” “There them--are there?” said prince. “What! think prince world, you?” “Oh, dear, no! all. But I know one many present, except princess----” “Yes, yes, it,” said fairy. “What it?” asked prince. But could get nothing fairy, go bed unanswered, something trial. Now wicked fairies bound law good fairies obey, always seems give bad advantage good, use means gain ends others not. But consequence, never succeeds; nay, end brings thing trying prevent. So see somehow, cleverness, wicked fairies dreadfully stupid, for, although beginning world really helped instead thwarting good fairies, one bit wiser it. She try bad thing her; succeeds better course. The prince far stolen march upon swamp-fairy know neighbourhood seen princess three times. When knew it, consoled thinking princess must far proud modest young man venture even speak seen six times least. But even less danger wicked fairy thought; for, however much princess might desire set free, dreadfully afraid wrong prince. Now, however, fairy going could. She contrived deceitful spells, next night prince could endeavour find way glade. It would take long tell tricks. They would amusing us, know could harm, something amusing poor prince. He wandered forest till daylight, fell fast asleep. The thing occurred seven following days, neither could find good fairy's cottage. After third quarter moon, however, bad fairy thought might ease affair fortnight least, chance prince wishing kiss princess period. So first day fourth quarter find cottage, next day found glade. For nearly another week haunted it. But princess never came. I little doubt farther edge part every night, period always wore black, and, little light, prince never saw her. Nor would known seen her. How could taken worn decrepit creature now, glorious Princess Daylight? At last, one night moon all, ventured near house. There heard voices talking, although past midnight; women considerable uneasiness, one whose turn watch fallen asleep, seen way went, night would probably wander far, describing circle touch open glade all, stretched away back house, deep side forest--a part prince knew nothing. When understood said disappeared, must gone somewhere said direction, plunged wood see could find her. For hours roamed nothing guide vague notion circle one side bordered house, much picked talk overheard. It getting towards dawn, yet streak light sky, came great birch-tree, sat weary foot it. While sat--very miserable, may sure--full fear princess, wondering attendants could take quietly, bethought would bad plan light fire, which, anywhere near, would attract her. This managed tinder-box, good fairy given him. It beginning blaze up, heard moan, seemed come side tree. He sprung feet, heart throbbed lean moment tree could move. When got round, lay human form little dark heap earth. There light enough fire show princess. He lifted arms, hardly heavier child, carried flame. The countenance old woman, fearfully strange look. A black hood concealed hair, eyes closed. He laid comfortably could, chafed hands, put little cordial bottle, also gift fairy, mouth; took coat wrapped her, short best could. In little opened eyes looked him--so pitifully! The tears rose flowed grey wrinkled cheeks, said never word. She closed eyes again, tears kept flowing, whole appearance utterly pitiful prince near crying too. He begged tell matter, promising could help her; still speak. He thought dying, took arms carry princess's house, thought good-natured cook might able something her. When lifted her, tears flowed yet faster, gave sad moan went heart. “Mother, mother!” said. “Poor mother!” kissed withered lips. She started; eyes opened upon him! But see them, still dark, enough make way trees towards house. Just approached door, feeling tired could imagined possible--she little thin old thing--she began move, became restless that, unable carry moment longer, thought lay grass. But stood upright feet. Her hood dropped, hair fell her. The first gleam morning caught face: face bright never-aging Dawn, eyes lovely sky darkest blue. The prince recoiled overmastering wonder. It Daylight brought forest! He fell feet, dared look laid hand upon head. He rose then. “You kissed I old woman: there! I kiss I young princess,” murmured Daylight.--“Is sun coming?” CHAPTER XXIX. RUBY THE children delighted story, made many amusing remarks upon it. Mr. Raymond promised search brain another, found one bring them. Diamond taken leave Nanny, promised go see soon, went away him. Now Mr. Raymond turning mind could Diamond Nanny. He therefore made acquaintance Diamond's father, greatly pleased him. But come resolution, anything good would like them, put certain test. So walked away together, began talk Diamond follows:-- “Nanny must leave hospital soon, Diamond.” “I glad that, sir.” “Why? Do think nice place?” “Yes, very. But better well something, know, even quite comfortable.” “But cannot keep Nanny long would like. They cannot keep till quite strong. There always many sick children want take make better. And question is, What send again?” “That I cannot tell, though I thinking over, sir. Her crossing taken long ago, I could bear see Nanny fighting it, especially poor fellow taken it. He quite lame, sir.” “She look much like fighting, now, she, Diamond?” “No, sir. She looks like angel. Angels fight--do they, sir?” “Not get things themselves, least,” said Mr. Raymond. “Besides,” added Diamond, “I quite see would better right crossing boy got it. Nobody gave her; took it. And taken it.” “If sweep crossing--soon least--after illness had, would laid first wet day,” said Mr. Raymond. “And hardly money got except wet days,” remarked Diamond reflectively. “Is nothing else could do, sir?” “Not without taught, I afraid.” “Well, could somebody teach something?” “Could teach her, Diamond?” “I know anything myself, sir. I could teach dress baby; nobody would give anything things like that: easy. There would much good teaching drive cab, would get cab drive? There fathers old Diamonds everywhere. At least poor Nanny cannot find them, I doubt.” “Perhaps taught nice clean, speak gentle words.” “Mother could teach that,” interrupted Diamond. “And dress babies, feed them, take care them,” Mr. Raymond proceeded, “she might get place nurse somewhere, know. People give money that.” “Then I ask mother,” said Diamond. “But give food then; father, strong, enough already without that.” “But me,” said Diamond: “I help it. When tired driving, I get. It make difference old Diamond. I mean likes well father--of course cannot, know--nobody could; duty same. It got done, know, sir; Diamond's good horse--is he, sir?” “From description I say certainly; I pleasure acquaintance myself.” “Do think go heaven, sir?” “That I know anything about,” said Mr. Raymond. “I confess I glad think so,” added, smiling thoughtfully. “I sure get back north wind, anyhow,” said Diamond himself; learned careful saying things aloud. “Is rather much go cab day every day?” resumed Mr. Raymond. “So father says, feels ribs morning. But says old horse eat well, moment supper, goes, never gets till called; and, legs him, father says makes end differ. Some horses, sir! lie night long, go sleep four pins, like haystack, father says. I think stupid them, old Diamond. But I suppose know better, cannot help it. We must hard upon them, father says.” “Your father must good man, Diamond.” Diamond looked Mr. Raymond's face, wondering could mean. “I said father must good man, Diamond.” “Of course,” said Diamond. “How could drive cab not?” “There men drive cabs good,” objected Mr. Raymond. Diamond remembered drunken cabman, saw friend right. “Ah, but,” returned, “he must be, know, horse old Diamond.” “That make difference,” said Mr. Raymond. “But quite enough good man without trying account it. Now, like, I give proof I think good man. I going away Continent while--for three months, I believe--and I going let house gentleman want use brougham. My horse nearly old, I fancy, Diamond, I want part him, I want idle; nobody, say, ought idle; neither I want worked hard. Now, come head perhaps father would take charge him, work certain conditions.” “My father right,” said Diamond. “I sure that.” “Well, I think. Will ask comes home call little chat me--to-day, time?” “He must dinner first,” said Diamond. “No, got dinner to-day. It must tea.” “Of course, course. Any time do. I shall home day.” “Very well, sir. I tell him. You may sure come. My father thinks kind gentleman, I know right, I know self, sir.” Mr. Raymond smiled, reached door, parted, Diamond went home. As soon father entered house, Diamond gave Mr. Raymond's message, recounted conversation preceded it. His father said little, took thought-sauce bread butter, soon finished meal, rose, saying: “I go friend directly, Diamond. It would grand thing get little money. We want it.” Diamond accompanied father Mr. Raymond's door, left him. He shown Mr. Raymond's study, gazed wonder multitude books walls, thought learned man Mr. Raymond must be. Presently Mr. Raymond entered, saying much old horse, made following distinct proposal--one over-advantageous Diamond's father, reasons--namely, Joseph use Mr. Raymond's horse away, condition never worked six hours day, fed well, that, besides, take Nanny home soon able leave hospital, provide one children, neither better worse--so long, is, horse. Diamond's father could help thinking pretty close bargain. He girl horse feed, six hours' work horse. “It save horse,” said Mr. Raymond. “That true,” answered Joseph; “but I get horse enough keep us, I save feed horse girl--do see, sir?” “Well, go home think it, let know end week. I hurry then.” So Joseph went home recounted proposal wife, adding think much advantage got it. “Not much way, husband,” said Diamond's mother; “but would advantage, matter gets it!” “I see it,” answered husband. “Mr. Raymond gentleman property, I discover much good helping save little more. He easily get one make bargain, I mean shall get me. It would loss rather gain--I think--at least I took less work horse.” “One hour would make difference old Diamond. But main point. You must think advantage would poor girl home go to!” “She one Diamond's friends,” thought father. “I could kind her, know,” mother went on, “and teach housework, handle baby; and, besides, would help me, I stronger it, able odd bit charing then, I got chance.” “I hear that,” said husband. “Have girl means. I ashamed I think sides thing once. I wonder horse great eater. To sure, I gave Diamond two hours' additional rest, would better old bones him, would four hours extra horse. That would give Diamond something every day. He could drive old Diamond dinner, I could take horse six hours tea, morning, I found best. It might pay keep them,--that is, I good luck. I like oblige Mr. Raymond, though rather hard, kind Diamond, wife. Has now?” “He indeed, Joseph,” said wife, conversation ended. Diamond's father went next day Mr. Raymond, accepted proposal; week got another stall stable, two horses instead one. Oddly enough, name new horse Ruby, red chestnut. Diamond's name came white lozenge forehead. Young Diamond said rich now, big diamond big ruby. CHAPTER XXX. NANNY'S DREAM NANNY fit moved time yet, Diamond went see often could. But regularly engaged now, seeing went every day hours old Diamond, baby mind, one horses attend to, could go often would liked. One evening, sat bedside, said him: “I beautiful dream, Diamond! I like tell you.” “Oh! do,” said Diamond; “I fond dreams!” “She must back north wind,” said himself. “It foolish dream, know. But somehow pleasant! What good thing believe dream time it!” My readers must suppose poor Nanny able say meant well I put here. She never school, heard little else vulgar speech came hospital. But I school, although could never make able dream well Nanny, made able tell dream better could herself. And I desirous I already done best I could Diamond's dream, would shame give boy advantage. “I tell I know it,” said Nanny. “The day yesterday, lady came see us--a beautiful lady, beautifully dressed. I heard matron say kind come blue gold; answered knew like dull colours. She lovely shawl on, like redness dipped milk, worked flowers colour. It shine much, silk, kept shine. When came bedside, sat down, sitting, Diamond, laid hand counterpane. I sitting up, table ready tea. Her hand looked pretty blue glove, I tempted stroke it. I thought would angry, everybody comes hospital kind. It streets kind. But drew hand away, I almost cried, I thought I rude. Instead that, however, like giving glove stroke, drew off, laid hand before. I sure, I ventured put ugly hand.” “Your hand ugly, Nanny,” said Diamond; Nanny went on-- “And I stroked again, stroked mine,--think that! And ring finger, I looked see like. And drew off, put upon one fingers. It red stone, told called ruby.” “Oh, funny!” said Diamond. “Our new horse called Ruby. We got another horse--a red one--such beauty!” But Nanny went story. “I looked ruby time lady talking me,--it beautiful! And talked I kept seeing deeper deeper stone. At last rose go away, I began pull ring finger; think said?--'Wear night, like. Only must take care it. I cannot give you, one gave me; may keep till to-morrow.' Was kind her? I could hardly take tea, I delighted hear it; I think ring set dreaming; for, I taken tea, I leaned back, half lying half sitting, looked ring finger. By degrees I began dream. The ring grew larger larger, last I found I looking red stone, red sunset, shone end long street near Grannie lives. I dressed rags I used be, I great holes shoes, nasty mud came feet. I use mind before, I thought horrid. And great red sunset, streaks green gold between, standing looking me. Why could I live sunset instead dirt? Why far away always? Why never come wretched street? It faded away, sunsets always do, last went altogether. Then cold wind began blow, flutter rags about----” “That North Wind herself,” said Diamond. “Eh?” said Nanny, went story. “I turned back it, wandered away. I know I going, warmer go way. I think north wind, I found west end last. But matter dream wind was.” “I know that,” said Diamond. “I believe North Wind get dreams--yes, blow them. Sometimes blown dream altogether.” “I know mean, Diamond,” said Nanny. “Never mind,” answered Diamond. “Two people cannot always understand other. They would back north wind directly, would become places without them?” “You talk oddly!” said Nanny. “I sometimes think must right you.” “What say me?” asked Diamond. “They called God's baby.” “How kind them! But I knew that.” “Did know meant, though? It meant right head.” “I feel right,” said Diamond, putting hands head, globe could take set again. “Well, long pleased I pleased,” said Nanny. “Thank you, Nanny. Do go story. I think I like dreams even better fairy tales. But must nice ones, like yours, know.” “Well, I went on, keeping back wind, I came fine street top hill. How happened I know, front door one houses open, front door, back door well, I could see right house--and think I saw? A garden place green grass, moon shining upon it! Think that! There moon street, house moon. I looked nobody near: I would harm, grass much nicer mud! But I could think going grass dirty shoes: I kicked gutter, ran bare feet, steps, house, grass; moment I came moonlight, I began feel better.” “That North Wind blew there,” said Diamond. “It came Mr. Raymond's story Princess Daylight,” returned Nanny. “Well, I lay upon grass moonlight without thinking I get again. Somehow moon suited exactly. There breath north wind talk about; quite gone.” “You want more, then. She never goes wanted,” said Diamond. “But blew moonlight, anyhow.” “Well, dispute it,” said Nanny: “you got tile loose, know.” “Suppose I have,” returned Diamond, “do see may let moonlight, sunlight matter?” “Perhaps yes, perhaps no,” said Nanny. “And got dreams, too, Nanny.” “Yes, I know dreams.” “So I. But I know besides something well.” “Oh! you?” rejoined Nanny. “I not.” “All right,” said Diamond. “Perhaps day.” “Perhaps I not,” said Nanny. Diamond held peace, Nanny resumed story. “I lay long time, moonlight got every tear clothes, made feel happy----” “There, I tell you!” said Diamond. “What tell me?” returned Nanny. “North Wind----” “It moonlight, I tell you,” persisted Nanny, Diamond held peace. “All I felt moon shining strong. I looked up, cloud, crapey fluffy, trying drown beautiful creature. But moon round, like whole plate, cloud could stick her. She shook off, said shone clearer brighter ever. But came thicker cloud,--and 'You shall not,' said moon; 'I will,' said cloud,--but could not: shone moon, quite laughing impudence. I knew ways, I always used watch her. She thing worth looking street night.” “Do call street,” said Diamond. “You going back it. You coming us, know.” “That good true,” said Nanny. “There things good enough true,” said Diamond; “but I hope is. Too good true cannot be. Is true good? good good? And how, then, anything good true? That like old Sal--to say that.” “Do abuse Grannie, Diamond. She horrid old thing, gin bottle; repent day, glad said anything her.” “Why?” said Diamond. “Because sorry her.” “I sorry now.” “Very well. That right. She sorry too. And end it.” “All right. You come us,” said Diamond. “Where I?” said Nanny. “Telling moon served clouds.” “Yes. But would do, it. Up came clouds clouds, came faster faster, moon covered up. You could expect throw hundred once--could you?” “Certainly not,” said Diamond. “So grew dark; dog began yelp house. I looked saw door garden shut. Presently opened--not let out, let dog in--yelping bounding. I thought caught sight me, I biting first, police after. So I jumped up, ran little summer-house corner garden. The dog came me, I shut door face. It well door--was it?” “You dreamed door wanted it,” said Diamond. “No, I not; came itself. It there, true dream.” “There--I caught you!” said Diamond. “I knew believed dream much I do.” “Oh, well, lay traps body!” said Nanny. “Anyhow, I safe inside summer-house. And think?--There moon beginning shine again--but one panes--and one colour ruby. Was funny?” “No, bit funny,” said Diamond. “If contrary!” said Nanny. “No, no,” said Diamond; “I meant pane I expected shine through.” “Oh, well!” returned Nanny. What Diamond meant, I pretend say. He curious notions things. “And now,” said Nanny, “I know do, dog kept barking door, I could get out. But moon beautiful I could keep looking red pane. And I looked got larger larger till filled whole pane outgrew it, I could see panes; grew till filled whole window, summer-house nearly bright day. “The dog stopped barking, I heard gentle tapping door, like wind blowing little branch it.” “Just like her,” said Diamond, thought everything strange beautiful must done North Wind. “So I turned window opened door; think I saw?” “A beautiful lady,” said Diamond. “No--the moon itself, big little house, round ball, shining like yellow silver. It stood grass--down grass: I could see nothing else brightness it: And I stared wondered, door opened side it, near ground, curious little old man, crooked thing shoulder, looked out, said: 'Come along, Nanny; lady wants you. We come fetch you.” I bit frightened. I went beautiful bright thing, old man held hand, I took hold it, gave jump, gave lift, I inside moon. And think like? It pretty little house, blue windows white curtains! At one windows sat beautiful lady, head leaning hand, looking out. She seemed rather sad, I sorry her, stood staring her. “`You think I beautiful mistress that!' said queer little man. `No, indeed!' I answered: `who would thought it?' `Ah! indeed? But see know everything.' The little man closed door, began pull rope hung behind weight end. After pulled while, said--`There, do; right now.' Then took hand opened little trap floor, led two three steps, I saw like great hole me. `Do frightened,' said tittle man. `It hole. It window. Put face look through.' I told me, garden summer-house, far away, lying bottom moonlight. `There!' said little man; `we brought off! Do see little dog barking us garden?' I told I could see anything far. `Can see anything small far off?' I said. `Bless you, child!' said little man; `I could pick needle grass I long enough arm. There one lying door summer-house now.' I looked eyes. They small, bright I think saw light went them. Then took up, little stair corner room, another trapdoor, one great round window us, I saw blue sky clouds, lots stars, big shining hard ever could!” “The little girl-angels polishing them,” said Diamond. “What nonsense talk!” said Nanny. “But nonsense good yours, Nanny. When done, I tell dream. The stars it--not moon, though. She away somewhere. Perhaps gone fetch then. I think that, though, dream longer ago yours. She might fetch one else, though; cannot fancy us get fine things done them. But tell came next.” Perhaps one child-readers may remember whether moon came fetch night Diamond dream. I cannot tell, course. I know come fetch me, though I think I could make follow I boy--not tiny one either. “The little man took round house, made look every window. Oh, beautiful! There were, air, nice, clean little house! `Your work keep windows bright,' said little man. `You find difficult, much dust here. Only, frost settles sometimes, drops rain leave marks them.' `I easily clean inside,' I said; `but I get frost rain outside them?' `Oh!' said, `it quite easy. There ladders about. You got go door, climb about. There great many windows seen yet, look places know anything about. I used clean myself, I getting rather old, see. Are I now?' `I cannot tell,' I answered. `You see I never saw younger.' `Never saw man moon?' said he. `Not near,' I answered, `not tell young old looked. I seen bundle sticks back.' For Jim pointed me. Jim fond looking man moon. Poor Jim! I wonder see me. I afraid ill too.” “I try find out,” said Diamond, “and let know.” “Thank you,” said Nanny. “You Jim ought friends.” “But man moon say, told seen bundle sticks back?” “He laughed. But I thought looked offended too. His little nose turned sharper, drew corners mouth tips ears neck. But look cross, know.” “Did say anything?” “Oh, yes! He said: `That nonsense. What saw bundle dusters. I going clean windows. It takes good many, know. Really, say superiors there!' `It know better,' I ventured say. `Of course, course,' said little man. `Nobody ever know better. Well, I forgive them, sets right, I hope.' `It good you,' I said. `No!' said he, `it least good me. I could comfortable otherwise.' After said nothing while, I laid floor garret, stared around great blue beautifulness. I forgotten almost, last said: `Are done yet?' `Done what?' I asked. `Done saying prayers,' says he. 'I saying prayers,' I answered. `Oh, yes, were,' said he, `though know it! And I must show something else.' “He took hand led stair again, narrow passage, another, another, another. I know could room many passages little house. The heart must ever much farther sides other. How could inside independent outside? There point. It funny--was it, Diamond?” “No,” said Diamond. He going say much sort thing back north wind; checked added, “All right. I see it. I see inside depend outside. It crabs. They creep outsides make new ones. Mr. Raymond told so.” “I see got it,” said Nanny. “Then go story, please,” said Diamond. “What come to, going winding passages heart moon?” “I say winding passages. I said long narrow. They wind. They went corners.” “That worth knowing,” remarked Diamond. “For knows soon may go there? But main thing is, come last?” “We came small box wall tiny room. The little man told put ear it. I so, heard noise something like purring cat, loud, much sweeter. `What it?' I asked. `Do know sound?' returned little man. `No,' I answered. `Do know sound bees?' said. I never heard bees, could know sound them. `Those lady's bees,' went on. I heard bees gather honey flowers. `But flowers them?' I asked. `My lady's bees gather honey sun stars,' said little man. `Do let see them,' I said. `No. I dare that,' answered. `I business them. I understand them. Besides, bright one fly eye, would blind altogether.' `Then seen them?' `Oh, yes! Once twice, I think. But I quite know: bright--like buttons lightning. Now I showed I to-night, go back room.' I followed him, made sit lamp hung roof, gave bread honey. “The lady never moved. She sat forehead leaning hand, gazing little window, hung like rest white cloudy curtains. From I sitting I looked too, I could see nothing. Her face beautiful, white, still, hand white forehead leaned it. I see whole face--only side it, never moved turn full upon me, even look me. “How long I sat I eaten bread honey, I know. The little man busy room, pulling string here, string there, chiefly string back door. I thinking uneasiness would soon wanting go clean windows, I fancy job. At last came great armful dusters. `It time set windows,' said; `for rain coming, quite clean before, rain cannot spoil them.' I got once. `You need afraid,' said. `You tumble off. Only must careful. Always hold one hand rub other.' As spoke, opened door. I started back terrible fright, nothing blue air seen me, like great water without bottom all. But must must, live much nicer mud holes shoes, I never thought I told. The little man showed lay hold I put foot round edge door first round ladder. `Once up,' said, `you see go well enough.' I told me, crept carefully. Then little man handed bundle dusters, saying, `I always carry reaping hook, I think could manage properly. You shall like.' I would take it, however, looked dangerous. “I best I could dusters, crawled top moon. But grand sight was! The stars head, bright near I could almost laid hold them. The round ball I clung went bobbing floating away dark blue every side. It beautiful fear left me, I set work diligently. I cleaned window window. At length I came little one, I peeped. There room box bees it! I laid ear window, heard musical hum quite distinctly. A great longing see came upon me, I opened window crept in. The little box door like closet. I opened it--the tiniest crack--when came light sting I closed terror--not, however, three bees shot room, darted like flashes lightning. Terribly frightened, I tried get window again, I could not: way outside moon door; room lady sat. No sooner I reached room, three bees, followed me, flew lady, settled upon hair. Then first I saw move. She started, put hand, caught them; rose and, held flame lamp one other, turned me. Her face sad stern. It frightened much. `Nanny, got trouble,' said. `You letting bees, I manage. You forced burn them. It great loss, storm.' As spoke, clouds gathered us. I could see come crowding white windows. `I sorry find,' said lady, `that trusted. You must go home again--you us.' Then came great clap thunder, moon rocked swayed. All grew dark me, I fell floor lay half-stunned. I could hear everything could see nothing. `Shall I throw door, lady?' said little man. `No,' answered; `she quite bad enough that. I think much harm her; never us. She would make dreadful mischief here. She fit mud. It great pity. I sorry her. Just take ring finger. I sadly afraid stolen it.' The little man caught hold hand, I felt tugging ring. I tried speak true it, but, terrible effort, gave groan. Other things began come head. Somebody else hold me. The little man there. I opened eyes last, saw nurse. I cried sleep, come waked me. But, Diamond, dream, I cannot help ashamed yet opening lady's box bees.” “You would again--would you--if take back?” said Diamond. “No. I think anything would ever make again. But good? I shall never chance.” “I know that,” said Diamond. “You silly baby! It dream,” said Nanny. “I know that, Nanny, dear. But tell may dream again?” “That bit likely.” “I know that,” said Diamond. “You always saying that,” said Nanny. “I like it.” “Then I say again--if I forget.” said Diamond. “But beautiful dream!--was it, Nanny? What pity opened door let bees out! You might long dream, nice talks moon-lady. Do try go again, Nanny. I want hear more.” But nurse came told time go; Diamond went, saying himself, “I cannot help thinking North Wind something dream. It would tiresome lie day night too--without dreaming. Perhaps done that, moon might carried back north wind--who knows?” CHAPTER XXXI. THE NORTH WIND DOTH BLOW IT WAS great delight Diamond length Nanny well enough leave hospital go home house. She strong yet, Diamond's mother considerate her, took care nothing quite fit for. If Nanny taken straight street, probable would pleasant decent household, easy teach; refining influences illness kind treatment hospital, moved house like rather sad pleasure haunting mind. As got better, colour came back cheeks, step grew lighter quicker, smile shone readily, became certain would soon treasure help. It great fun see Diamond teaching hold baby, wash dress him, often laughed together awkwardness. But many lessons able perform duties quite well Diamond himself. Things however go well Joseph arrival Ruby. It almost seemed red beast brought ill luck him. The fares fewer, pay less. Ruby's services indeed make week's income first little beyond used be, two feed. After first month fell lame, whole next Joseph dared attempt work him. I cannot say never grumbled, health far been; I say tried best. During month, lived short commons indeed, seldom tasting meat except Sundays, poor old Diamond, worked hardest all, even then--so end thin clothes-horse, Ruby plump sleek bishop's cob. Nor much better Ruby able work again, season great depression business, soon felt amongst cabmen. City men look shillings, wives daughters less spend. It besides wet autumn, bread rose greatly price. When I add Diamond's mother poorly, new baby coming, see jolly times friends mews. Notwithstanding depressing influences around him, Joseph able keep little hope alive heart; came home night, would get Diamond read him, would also make Nanny produce book might see getting on. For Diamond taken education hand, clever child, soon able put letters words together. Thus three months passed away, Mr. Raymond return. Joseph looking anxiously him, chiefly desire getting rid Ruby--not absolutely use him, constant weight upon mind. Indeed, far provision went, rather worse Ruby Nanny before, hand, Nanny great help house, comfort think new baby come, Nanny would wife. Of God's gifts baby greatest; therefore wonder one came, heartily welcomed little household brought plenty her. Of course made great difference work done--far difference size warranted, Nanny end help, Diamond much sunbeam ever, began sing new baby first moment got arms. But sing songs sung brother, for, said, new baby must new songs; besides, sister-baby brother-baby, course would like kind songs. Where difference songs lay, however, I pretend able point out. One thing I sure of, small share education little girl, helped whole family great deal aware. How managed get long dreary expensive winter, I hardly say. Sometimes things better, sometimes worse. But last spring came, winter gone, much. Still, Mr. Raymond return, although mother would able manage without Nanny now, could look place long Ruby; altogether sorry this. One week last worse yet had. They almost without bread over. But sadder saw father mother looking, Diamond set sing two babies. One thing increased expenses forced hire another little room Nanny. When second baby came, Diamond gave room Nanny might hand help mother, went hers, which, although fine place accustomed to, nice eyes. He mind change though, mother comfortable it? And Nanny comfortable too? And indeed Diamond comfortable people comfortable? And comfort every way, change happy one. CHAPTER XXXII. DIAMOND AND RUBY IT WAS Friday night, Diamond, like rest household, little eat day. The mother would always pay week's rent laid anything even food. His father gloomy--so gloomy actually cross wife. It strange thing pain seeing suffering love sometimes make us add suffering cross them. This comes faith enough God, shows necessary faith is, lose it, lose even kindness alone soothe suffering. Diamond consequence gone bed quiet thoughtful--a little troubled indeed. It stormy winter, even spring come, north wind often blew. When Diamond went bed, tiny room roof, heard like sea moaning; fell asleep still heard moaning. All said himself, “Am I awake, I asleep?” But time answer question, North Wind calling him. His heart beat fast, long time since heard voice. He jumped bed, looked everywhere, could see her. “Diamond, come here,” said again; could tell. To sure room quite dark, might close beside him. “Dear North Wind,” said Diamond, “I want much go you, I cannot tell where.” “Come here, Diamond,” answer. Diamond opened door, went room, stair yard. His little heart flutter, long given thought seeing again. Neither see her. When got out, great puff wind came him, obedience turned back, went blew. It blew right stable-door, went blowing. “She wants go stable,” said Diamond himself, “but door locked.” He knew key was, certain hole wall--far high get at. He ran place, however: reached came wild blast, fell key clanging stones feet. He picked up, ran back opened stable-door, went in. And think saw? A little light came dusty window gas-lamp, sufficient show Diamond Ruby two heads up, looking across partition stalls. The light showed white mark Diamond's forehead, Ruby's eye shone bright, thought light came went in. This saw. But think heard? He heard two horses talking other--in strange language, yet, somehow other, could understand, turn mind English. The first words heard Diamond, apparently already quarrelling Ruby. “Look fat Ruby!” said old Diamond. “You plump skin shines so, ought ashamed yourself.” “There harm fat,” said Ruby deprecating tone. “No, sleek. I may well shine not.” “No harm?” retorted Diamond. “Is harm go eating poor master's oats, taking much time grooming you, work six hours--no, six hours day, and, I hear, get along faster big dray-horse two tons behind him?--So tell me.” “Your master's mine,” said Ruby. “I must attend master's interests, eat given me, sleek fat I can, go faster I need.” “Now really rest horses asleep, poor things--they work till tired--I believe would get kick stable. You make ashamed horse. You dare say master master! That gratitude way feeds spares you! Pray would carcass him?” “He sake. If I horse, would work hard you.” “And I proud worked. I would fat you--not worth. You disgrace stable. Look horse next you. He something like horse--all skin bone. And master kind either. He put stinging lash whip last week. But old horse knows got wife children keep--as well drunken master--and works like horse. I daresay grudges master beer drinks, I believe grudges anything else.” “Well, I grudge gets me,” said Ruby. “Gets!” retorted Diamond. “What gets worth grudging. It comes next nothing--what fat shine. “Well, least ought thankful better it. You get two hours' rest day it.” “I thank master that--not you, lazy fellow! You go along like buttock beef upon castors--you do.” “Are afraid I kick, go like that, Diamond?” “Kick! You could kick tried. You might heave rump half foot, lashing out--oho! If did, would belly could get legs again. It belief, out, would stick ever. Talk kicking! Why put one foot cab? The abuse master gets sake quite shameful. No decent horse would bring him. Depend upon it, Ruby, cabman likes abused fare. But fares, least shafts, much excused. Indeed are.” “Well, see, Diamond, I want go lame again.” “I believe lame all--there!” “Oh, I was.” “Then I believe fault. I lame. I never lame life. You take care legs. You never lay night. There huge carcass crushing poor legs night long. You even care legs--so long eat, eat, sleep, sleep. You horse indeed!” “But I tell I lame.” “I denying puffy look off-pastern. But belief is, even grease--it fat.” “I tell I put foot one horrid stones make roads with, gave ankle twist.” “Ankle indeed! Why ape betters? Horses got ankles: pasterns. And long lift feet better, fall asleep every step, run good chance laming ankles call them, one another. It lively horse comes grief way. I tell I believe much, was, fault. There! I done. I going sleep. I try think well I can. If would step bit run little fat!” Here Diamond began double knees; Ruby spoke again, and, young Diamond thought, rather different tone. “I say, Diamond, I cannot bear honest old horse like think like that. I tell truth: fault I fell lame.” “I told so,” returned other, tumbling partition rolled side give legs every possible privilege narrow circumstances. “I meant it, Diamond.” At words, old horse arose scramble like thunder, shot angry head glaring eye Ruby's stall, said-- “Keep way, unworthy wretch, I bite you. You horse! Why that?” “Because I wanted grow fat.” “You grease-tub! Oh! teeth tail! I thought humbug! Why want get fat? There truth got cross-questioning. You fit horse.” “Because I fat, nature keep fat long time; I know master might come home want see me.” “You conceited, good-for-nothing brute! You fit knacker's yard. You wanted look handsome, you? Hold tongue, I break halter you--with handsome fat!” “Never mind, Diamond. You good horse. You cannot hurt me.” “Cannot hurt you! Just let try.” “No, cannot.” “Why then?” “Because I angel.” “What that?” “Of course know.” “Indeed I not.” “I know not. An ignorant, rude old human horse, like you, could know it. But young Diamond listening saying; knows well enough horses heaven angels ride upon, well animals, lions eagles bulls, important situations. The horses angels ride, must angel-horses, else angels could ride upon them. Well, I one them.” “You not.” “Did ever know horse tell lie?” “Never before. But confessed shamming lame.” “Nothing sort. It necessary I grow fat, necessary good Joseph, master, grow lean. I could pretended lame, horse, least angel-horse would do. So I must lame, I sprained ankle--for angel-horses ankles--they talk horse-slang there--and hurt much, I assure you, Diamond, though may good enough able believe it.” Old Diamond made reply. He lain again, sleepy snort, like snore, revealed that, already asleep, past understanding word Ruby saying. When young Diamond found this, thought might venture take dropt shuttlecock conversation. “I good enough believe it, Ruby,” said. But Ruby never turned head, took notice him. I suppose understand English coachman stableman habit addressing with. Finding, however, companion made reply, shot head partition looking said-- “You wait till to-morrow, see whether I speaking truth not.--I declare old horse fast asleep!--Diamond!--No I not.” Ruby turned away, began pulling hayrack silence. Diamond gave shiver, looking round saw door stable open. He began feel dreaming, glance stable see North Wind anywhere visible, thought better go back bed. CHAPTER XXXIII. THE PROSPECT BRIGHTENS THE next morning, Diamond's mother said father, “I quite comfortable child again.” “Which child, Martha?” asked Joseph. “You got choice now.” “Well, Diamond I mean. I afraid getting queer ways again. He old trick walking sleep. I saw run stair middle night.” “Did go him, wife?” “Of course I did--and found fast asleep bed. It little meat last six weeks, I afraid.” “It may that. I sorry. But please God send us enough, I do, wife?” “You cannot help it, I know, dear good man,” returned Martha. “And I know. I see get well rest us. There I nursing baby time, I get along pretty well. I sure, hear little man singing, would think much amiss him.” For moment Diamond singing like lark clouds. He new baby arms, mother dressing herself. Joseph sitting breakfast--a little weak tea, dry bread, dubious butter--which Nanny set him, enjoying hungry. He groomed horses, got old Diamond harnessed ready put to. “Think fat angel, Dulcimer!” said Diamond. The baby christened yet, Diamond, reading Bible, come upon word dulcimer, thought pretty ever called sister Dulcimer! “Think red, fat angel, Dulcimer!” repeated; “for Ruby's angel horse, Dulcimer. He sprained ankle got fat purpose.” “What purpose, Diamond?” asked father. “Ah! I cannot tell. I suppose look handsome master comes,” answered Diamond.--“What think, Dulcimer? It must good, Ruby's angel.” “I wish I rid him, anyhow,” said father; “for weighs heavy mind.” “No wonder, father: fat,” said Diamond. “But need afraid, everybody says better condition him.” “Yes, may thin tin horse owner comes. It bad leave hands way.” “Perhaps could help it,” suggested Diamond. “I daresay good reason it.” “So I said,” returned father, “if driven hard bargain first.” “But know may come yet, husband,” said wife. “Mr. Raymond may give little boot, seeing bargain wanted reckoned upon.” “I afraid not: hard man,” said Joseph, rose went get cab out. Diamond resumed singing. For time carolled snatches everything anything; last settled something like follows. I cannot tell got it. Where come from, baby dear? Out everywhere here. Where get eyes blue? Out sky I came through. What makes light sparkle spin? Some starry spikes left in. Where get little tear? I found waiting I got here. What makes forehead smooth high? A soft hand stroked I went by. What makes cheek like warm white rose? I saw something better one knows. Whence three-cornered smile bliss? Three angels gave kiss. Where get pearly ear? God spoke, came hear. Where get arms hands? Love made hooks bands. Feet, whence come, darling things? From box cherubs' wings. How come you? God thought me, I grew. But come us, dear? God thought you, I here. “You never made song, Diamond,” said mother. “No, mother. I wish I had. No, I not. That would take somebody else. But mine that.” “What makes yours?” “I love so.” “Does loving thing make yours?” “I think so, mother--at least anything else can. If I love baby (which could be, know) would mine bit. But I love baby, baby Dulcimer.” “The baby's mine, Diamond.” “That makes mine, mother.” “How make out?” “Because mine, mother.” “Is love me?” “Yes, because. Love makes myness,” said Diamond. When father came home dinner, change Diamond Ruby, saw look sad, told fare worth mentioning whole morning. “We shall go workhouse, wife,” said. “It would better go back north wind,” said Diamond, dreamily, intending say aloud. “So would,” answered father. “But get there, Diamond?” “We must wait till taken,” returned Diamond. Before father could speak again, knock came door, walked Mr. Raymond smile face. Joseph got received respectfully, cordially. Martha set chair him, would sit down. “You glad see me,” said Joseph. “You want part old horse.” “Indeed, sir, mistaken there. What anxiety him, bad luck, I wished I rid thousand times. It three months, eight nine.” “I sorry hear statement,” said Mr. Raymond. “Has service you?” “Not much, lameness” “Ah!” said Mr. Raymond, hastily--“you laming him--have you? That accounts it. I see, I see.” “It fault, right now. I know happened, but--” “He purpose,” said Diamond. “He put foot stone twist ankle.” “How know that, Diamond?” said father, turning him. “I never said so, I could think came.” “I heard it--in stable,” answered Diamond. “Let us look him,” said Mr. Raymond. “If step yard,” said Joseph, “I bring out.” They went, Joseph, first taken harness, walked Ruby middle yard. “Why,” said Mr. Raymond, “you using well.” “I know mean that, sir. I expect hear you. He sound wind limb--as sound barrel.” “And big, might add. Why, fat pig! You call good usage!” Joseph angry make answer. “You worked enough, I say. That making good use him. That would done by.” “I sorry I served same, sir.” “He fat, I say.” “There whole month I could work all, nothing eat head off. He awful eater. I taken best part six hours day since, I always afraid coming grief again, I could make even that. I declare you, sir, shafts, I sit box miserable I would stolen him. He looks time bottling complaints make minute set eyes again. There! look now, squinting round one eye! I declare you, word, I laid whip three times.” “I glad hear it. He never want whip.” “I say that, sir. If ever horse wanted whip, do. He brought beggary almost snail's pace. I glad come rid him.” “I know that,” said Mr. Raymond. “Suppose I ask buy me--cheap.” “I would present, sir. I like him. And I would drive horse I like--no, gold. It cannot come good love them.” “Just bring horse, let see sort pair would make.” Joseph laughed rather bitterly went fetch Diamond. When two placed side side, Mr. Raymond could hardly keep countenance, mingling feelings. Beside great, red, round barrel, Ruby, body legs, Diamond looked like clothes-horse skin thrown it. There hardly spot could descry sign bone underneath. Gaunt grim weary stood, kissing master, heeding one else. “You using well,” said Mr. Raymond. “I must say,” returned Joseph, throwing arm round horse's neck, “that remark better spared, sir. The horse worth three now.” “I think so. I think make nice pair. If one's fat, other's lean--so right. And buy Ruby, I must buy Diamond.” “Thank you, sir,” said Joseph, tone implying anything thanks. “You seem like proposal,” said Mr. Raymond. “I not,” returned Joseph. “I would part old Diamond skin full nuggets bones.” “Who said anything parting him?” “You now, sir.” “No; I not. I spoke buying make pair Ruby. We could pare Ruby patch Diamond bit. And height, near match I care about. Of course would coachman--if would consent reconciled Ruby.” Joseph stood bewildered, unable answer. “I bought small place Kent,” continued Mr. Raymond, “and I must pair carriage, roads hilly thereabouts. I want make show pair high-steppers. I think do. Suppose, week two, set take Ruby bring Diamond up. If could lay pipe Ruby's sides Diamond's, would work moment. But I fear would answer.” A strong inclination laugh intruded upon Joseph's inclination cry, made speech still harder before. “I beg pardon, sir,” said length. “I miserable, long, I never thought chaffing said I used horses well. I grumble you, sir, many's time trouble; whenever I said anything, little Diamond would look smile, much say: 'I know better you, father;' upon word, I always thought boy must right.” “Will sell old Diamond, then?” “I will, sir, one condition--that ever want part me, give option buying him. I could part him, sir. As calls his, nothing; for, Diamond says, loving thing make yours--and I love old Diamond, sir, dearly.” “Well, cheque twenty pounds, I wrote offer him, case I find done handsome thing Ruby. Will enough?” “It much, sir. His body worth it--shoes all. It heart, sir--that worth millions--but heart'll mine same--so much, sir.” “I think so. It be, least, time got fed again. You take welcome. Just go cabbing another month, take Ruby let Diamond rest; time I shall ready go country.” “Thank you, sir, thank you. Diamond set friend, sir, moment saw you. I believe child mine knows people.” “I think so, too,” said Mr. Raymond walked away. He meant test Joseph made bargain Ruby, intention greatly prolonging trial. He taken ill Switzerland, quite unable return sooner. He went away highly gratified finding stood test, true man. Joseph rushed wife standing window anxiously waiting result long colloquy. When heard horses go together double harness, burst forth immoderate fit laughter. Diamond came baby arms made big anxious eyes her, saying-- “What matter you, mother dear? Do cry little. It good. When father takes ever small drop spirits, puts water it.” “You silly darling!” said mother; “how could I laugh notion great fat Ruby going side side poor old Diamond?” “But not, mother? With month's oats, nothing do, Diamond'll nearer Ruby's size father's. I think good different sorts go together. Now Ruby chance teaching Diamond better manners.” “How dare say thing, Diamond?” said father, angrily. “To compare two manners, comparison possible. Our Diamond's gentleman.” “I mean say not, father; I daresay gentlemen judge neighbours unjustly. That I mean. Diamond thought bad things Ruby. He try make best him.” “How know that, pray?” “I heard talking one night.” “Who?” “Why Diamond Ruby. Ruby's angel.” Joseph stared said more. For new gladness, gloomy re-harnessed angel, thought darling Diamond going mind. He could help thinking rather differently, however, found change come Ruby. Considering fat, exerted amazingly, got ground incredible speed. So willing, even anxious, go now, Joseph hold quite tight. Then laughed fancies, new fear came upon lest horse break wind, Mr. Raymond good think using well. He might even suppose taken advantage new instructions, let upon horse pent-up dislike; whereas truth, utterly vanished felt Ruby, too, friend time. CHAPTER XXXIV. IN THE COUNTRY BEFORE end month, Ruby got respectably thin, Diamond respectably stout. They really began look fit double harness. Joseph wife got affairs order, everything ready migrating shortest notice; felt peaceful happy judged trouble gone well worth enduring. As Nanny, happy ever since left hospital, expected nothing better, saw nothing attractive notion country. At time, least idea word country meant, never seen anything streets gas-lamps. Besides, attached Jim Diamond: Jim reasonable being, Diamond eyes best amiable, over-grown baby, amount expostulation would ever bring talk sense, say think it. Now could manage baby well he, judged altogether superior. Towards father mother, could wish. Diamond taken great deal pains trouble find Jim, last succeeded help tall policeman, glad renew acquaintance strange child. Jim moved quarters, heard Nanny's illness till time taken hospital, shy go inquire her. But length went live Diamond's family, Jim willing enough go see her. It one visits, talking new prospects, Nanny expressed Diamond opinion country. “There nothing sun moon, Diamond.” “There trees flowers,” said Diamond. “Well, count,” returned Nanny. “Are they? They beautiful, make happy look them.” “That silly.” Diamond smiled far-away look, gazing clouds green leaves vision contented him. But thinking could Nanny; evening went find Mr. Raymond, heard returned town. “Ah! do, Diamond?” said Mr. Raymond; “I glad see you.” And indeed, grown fond him. His opinion different Nanny's. “What want now, child?” asked. “I always wanting something, sir,” answered Diamond. “Well, quite right, long want right. Everybody always wanting something; mention right place often enough. What now?” “There friend Nanny's, lame boy, called Jim.” “I heard him,” said Mr. Raymond. “Well?” “Nanny care much going country, sir.” “Well, Jim?” “You could find corner Jim work in--could you, sir?” “I know I could not. That is, show good reason it.” “He good boy, sir.” “Well, much better him.” “I know shine boots, sir.” “So much better us.” “You want boots shined country--do you, sir?” “Yes, sure.” “It would nice walk flowers dirty boots--would it, sir?” “No, indeed.” “They would like it--would they?” “No, would not.” “Then Nanny would better pleased go, sir.” “If flowers like dirty boots walk them, Nanny would mind going country? Is it? I quite see it.” “No, sir; I mean that. I meant, would take Jim clean boots, odd jobs, know, sir, Nanny would like better. She fond Jim!” “Now come point, Diamond. I see mean, exactly. I turn mind. Could bring Jim see me?” “I try, sir. But mind much. They think I silly,” added Diamond, one sweetest smiles. What Mr. Raymond thought, I dare hardly attempt put here. But one part was, highest wisdom must ever appear folly possess it. “I think would come though--after dark, know,” Diamond continued. “He well shining boots. People's kind lame boys, know, sir. But dark, much doing.” Diamond succeeded bringing Jim Mr. Raymond, consequence resolved give boy chance. He provided new clothes Nanny; upon certain day, Joseph took wife three children, Nanny Jim, train certain station county Kent, found cart waiting carry luggage The Mound, name Mr. Raymond's new residence. I describe varied feelings party went, arrived. All I say is, Diamond, care, full quiet delight--a gladness deep talk about. Joseph returned town night, next morning drove Ruby Diamond down, carriage behind them, Mr. Raymond lady carriage. For Mr. Raymond old bachelor longer: bringing wife live The Mound. The moment Nanny saw her, recognised lady lent ruby-ring. That ring given Mr. Raymond. The weather hot, woods shadowy. There great many wild flowers, getting well towards autumn, wild flowers rise early leaves, not, would never get glimpse sun them. So fun over, ready go bed time trees dressed. But plenty loveliest grass daisies house, Diamond's chief pleasure seemed lie amongst them, breathe pure air. But time, dreaming country back north wind, trying recall songs river used sing. For like back north wind anything known since left it. Sometimes would little brother, sometimes little sister, sometimes grass him, felt like cat first kittens, said, could purr--all could sing. These different times used drive cab, must suppose Diamond idle. He much mother now, Nanny occupied former place; helped father still, stable harness-room, generally went box might learn drive pair, ready open carriage-door. Mr. Raymond advised father give plenty liberty. “A boy like that,” said, “ought pushed.” Joseph assented heartily, smiling idea pushing Diamond. After everything fell share, boy wealth time disposal. And happy, sometimes merry time was. Only two months so, neither saw heard anything North Wind. CHAPTER XXXV. I MAKE DIAMOND'S ACQUAINTANCE MR. RAYMOND'S house called The Mound, stood upon little steep knoll, smooth symmetrical showed artificial. It had, beyond doubt, built Queen Elizabeth hunting tower--a place, namely, top could see country miles sides, able follow eyes flying deer pursuing hounds horsemen. The mound cast give good basement-advantage neighbouring heights woods. There great quarry-hole far off, brim-full water, which, current legend stated, materials forming heart mound--a kind stone unfit building--had dug. The house brick, said foundations first laid natural level, stones earth mound heaped them, great height well buttressed. Joseph wife lived little cottage short way house. It real cottage, roof thick thatch, which, June July, wind sprinkled red white petals shook loose topmost sprays rose-trees climbing walls. At first Diamond nest thatch--a pretty little room white muslin curtains, afterwards Mr. Mrs. Raymond wanted page house, father mother quite pleased employed without leaving them. So dressed suit blue, pale face fair hair came like loveliest blossom, took abode house. “Would afraid sleep alone, Diamond?” asked mistress. “I know mean, madam,” said Diamond. “I never afraid anything I recollect--not much, least.” “There little room top house--all alone,” returned; “perhaps would mind sleeping there?” “I sleep anywhere, I like best high up. Should I able see out?” “I show place,” answered; taking hand, led oval-winding stair one two towers. Near top entered tiny little room, two windows could see whole country. Diamond clapped hands delight. “You would like room, then, Diamond?” said mistress. “It grandest room house,” answered. “I shall near stars, yet far tops trees. That I like.” I daresay thought, also, would nice place North Wind call passing; said nothing sort. Below spread lake green leaves, glimpses grass bottom it. As looked down, saw squirrel appear suddenly, suddenly vanish amongst topmost branches. “Aha! little squirrel,” cried, “my nest built higher yours.” “You books much like,” said mistress. “I little bell hung door, I ring I want you. Half-way stair drawing-room.” So Diamond installed page, new room got ready him. It soon I came know Diamond. I tutor family whose estate adjoined little property belonging The Mound. I made acquaintance Mr. Raymond London time before, walking drive towards house call upon one fine warm evening, I saw Diamond first time. He sitting foot great beech-tree, yards road, book knees. He see me. I walked behind tree, peeping shoulder, saw reading fairy-book. “What reading?” I said, spoke suddenly, hope seeing startled little face look round me. Diamond turned head quietly obeying mother's voice, calmness face rebuked unkind desire made ashamed it. “I reading story Little Lady Goblin Prince,” said Diamond. “I sorry I know story,” I returned. “Who by?” “Mr. Raymond made it.” “Is uncle?” I asked guess. “No. He master.” “What him?” I asked respectfully. “Anything wishes do,” answered. “I busy now. He gave story read. He wants opinion upon it.” “Do find rather hard make mind?” “Oh dear no! Any story always tells I think it. Mr. Raymond want say whether clever story not, whether I like it, I like it. I never tell call clever call silly, I always know whether I like story not.” “And always tell like not?” “No. Very often I cannot all. Sometimes I can. I always know, I cannot always tell why. Mr. Raymond writes stories, tries me. Mother makes jam. She made lot jam since came here! And always makes taste see do. Mother knows face I make whether not.” At moment I caught sight two children approaching. One handsome girl, pale-faced, awkward-looking boy, limped much one leg. I withdrew little, see would follow, seemed consternation. After hurried words, went together, I pursued way house, I kindly received Mr. Mrs. Raymond I could desired. From I learned something Diamond, consequence glad find him, I returned, seated place before. “What boy girl want you, Diamond?” I asked. “They seen creature frightened them.” “And came tell it?” “They could get water well it. So wanted go them.” “They bigger you.” “Yes, frightened it.” “And frightened it?” “No.” “Why?” “Because I silly. I never frightened things.” I could help thinking old meaning word silly. “And it?” I asked. “I think kind angel--a little one. It long body great wings, drove fast grew thin cloud round it. It flew backwards forwards well, hung right middle, making mist wings, business take care water.” “And drive away?” “I drive away. I knew, whatever creature was, well get water of. So I took jug, dipped in, drew water.” “And creature do?” “Flew about.” “And hurt you?” “No. Why it? I anything wrong.” “What companions say then?” “They said--`Thank you, Diamond. What dear silly are!'” “And angry them?” “No! Why I? I like would play little; always like better go away together work over. They never heed me. I mind much, though. The creatures friendly. They run away me. Only busy work, mind much.” “Do feel lonely, then?” “Oh, no! When nobody minds me, I get nest, look up. And sky mind me, thinks me.” “Where nest?” He rose, saying, “I show you,” led side tree. There hung little rope-ladder one lower boughs. The boy climbed ladder got upon bough. Then climbed farther leafy branches, went sight. After little while, I heard voice coming tree. “I nest now,” said voice. “I cannot see you,” I returned. “I cannot see either, I see first star peeping sky. I like get sky. Do think I shall, day?” “Yes, I do. Tell see there.” “I see anything more, except leaves, big sky me. It goes swinging about. The earth behind back. There comes another star! The wind like kisses big lady. When I get I feel I North Wind's arms.” This first I heard North Wind. The whole ways look child, full quiet wisdom, yet ready accept judgment others dispraise, took hold heart, I felt wonderfully drawn towards him. It seemed me, somehow, little Diamond possessed secret life, ready think lowest living thing--an angel God something special say do. A gush reverence came me, single goodnight, I turned left nest. I saw often this, gained much confidence told I told you. I cannot pretend account it. I leave philosophical reader fashion. The easiest way Nanny Jim, said often Diamond tile loose. But Mr. Raymond much opinion concerning boy; Mrs. Raymond confessed often rang bell pleasure seeing lovely stillness boy's face, blue eyes seemed rather made people look look of. It plainer others felt desertion Nanny Jim. They appeared regard mere toy, except found could minister scruple using him--generally success. They were, however, well-behaved wonderful degree; I little doubt much good behaviour owing unconscious influence boy called God's baby. One strange thing I could never find got many songs. At times would bubbles blown nursery rhyme, following, I heard sing one evening little Dulcimer. There score sheep feeding paddock near him, white wool dyed pale rose light setting sun. Those long shadows trees dead white; sunlight half glorified pale rose. Little Bo Peep, lost sheep, And know find them; They height sight, Trailing tails behind them. Little Bo Peep woke sleep, Jump'd set find them: “The silly things, got wings, And left trails behind them: “They taken tails, left trails, And I shall follow find them;” For wherever tail dragged trail, The long grass grew behind them. And day's eyes butter-cups, cow's lips crow's feet Were glittering sun. She threw book, caught crook, And sheep run. She ran, ran, ever ran, The grass grew higher higher; Till hill sun began To set flame fire. She ran still--up grassy hill, And grass grew higher higher; When reached crown, sun down, And left trail fire. The sheep tails gone, gone-- And trail behind them! Yes, yes! there--long-tailed fair, But, alas! could find them. Purple gold, rosy blue, With tails white behind them, Her sheep run trail sun; She saw them, could find them. After sun, like clouds run, But knew sheep: She sat cry, look sky, But cried asleep. And slept dew fell fast, And wind blew sky; And strange things took place shun day's face, Because sweet shy. Nibble, nibble, crop! heard woke: A hundred little lambs Did pluck eat grass sweet That grew trails dams. Little Bo Peep caught crook, And wiped tears blind her. And nibble, nibble crop! without stop! The lambs came eating behind her. Home, home came, tired lame, With three times many sheep. In month more, big before, And laugh sleep. But would say, one fine day, When got bushiest tails, Their grown game same, And follow trails? Never weep, Bo Peep, though lose sheep, And know find them; It Is sun mothers run, And lambs behind them. I confess touched little, loses far Diamond's sweet voice singing gains rhyme there. Some books Mr. Raymond given him. These always knew, others could seldom tell. Sometimes would say, “I made one.” generally would say, “I know; I found somewhere;” “I got back north wind.” One evening I found sitting grassy slope house, Dulcimer arms little brother rolling grass beside them. He chanting usual way, like sound brook anything else I think of. When I went ceased chant. “Do go on, Diamond. Do mind me,” I said. He began once. While sang, Nanny Jim sat little way off, one hemming pocket-handkerchief, reading story her, never heeded Diamond. This near sang I recollect, reproduce rather. What would see I took To little nest air? You would see sky like clear blue cup Turned upside downwards there. What would I took To little nest tree? My child cries would trouble air, To get could see. What would get top tree For crying grief? Not star would clutch see-- You could gather leaf. But lost greedy grief, Content see afar, You would find hand withering leaf, In heart shining star. As Diamond went singing, grew dark, ceased came great flash lightning, blinded us moment. Dulcimer crowed pleasure; roar thunder came it, little brother gave loud cry terror. Nanny Jim came running us, pale fear. Diamond's face, too, paler usual, delight. Some glory seemed clung it, remained shining. “You frightened--are you, Diamond?” I said. “No. Why I be?” answered usual question, looking face calm shining eyes. “He got sense frightened,” said Nanny, going giving pitying hug. “Perhaps sense frightened, Nanny,” I returned. “Do think lightning likes?” “It might kill you,” said Jim. “Oh, no, might not!” said Diamond. As spoke came another great flash, tearing crack. “There tree struck!” I said; looked round, blinding flash left eyes, saw huge bough beech-tree Diamond's nest hanging ground like broken wing bird. “There!” cried Nanny; “I told so. If see would happened, little silly!” “No, I not,” said Diamond, began sing Dulcimer. All I could hear song, children going chatter, was-- The clock struck one, And mouse came down. Dickery, dickery, dock! Then came blast wind, rain followed straight-pouring lines, watering-pot. Diamond jumped little Dulcimer arms, Nanny caught little boy, ran cottage. Jim vanished double shuffle, I went house. When I came return home, clouds gone, evening sky glimmered trees, blue, pale-green towards west, I turned steps little aside look stricken beech. I saw bough torn stem, twilight would allow see. While I stood gazing, sky came sound singing, voice neither lark nightingale: sweeter either: voice Diamond, airy nest:-- The lightning thunder, They go come; But stars stillness Are always home. And voice ceased. “Good-night, Diamond,” I said. “Good-night, sir,” answered Diamond. As I walked away pondering, I saw great black top beech swaying sky upper wind, heard murmur many dim half-articulate voices filling solitude around Diamond's nest. CHAPTER XXXVI. DIAMOND QUESTIONS NORTH WIND MY READERS wonder that, this, I best gain friendship Diamond. Nor I find difficult, child ready trust. Upon one subject alone reticent--the story relations North Wind. I fancy could quite make mind think them. At events little time trusted this, told everything. If I could regard exactly light did, I was, guiltless least pretence, fully sympathetic, satisfied without demanding theory difficult points involved. I let see plainly enough, whatever might explanation marvellous experience, I would given much similar one myself. On evening soon thunderstorm, late twilight, half-moon high heavens, I came upon Diamond act climbing little ladder beech-tree. “What always going for, Diamond?” I heard Nanny ask, rather rudely, I thought. “Sometimes one thing, sometimes another, Nanny,” answered Diamond, looking skywards climbed. “You break neck day,” said. “I going look moon to-night,” added, without heeding remark. “You see moon well here,” returned. “I think so.” “You nearer there.” “Oh, yes! I shall. I must nearer her, know. I wish I could dream pretty dreams can, Nanny.” “You silly! never done dream. I never dreamed one, nonsense enough, I sure.” “It nonsense. It beautiful dream--and funny one too, one.” “But good talking way, know dream? Dreams true.” “That one true, Nanny. You know was. Did come grief told do? And true?” “I cannot get sense him,” exclaimed Nanny, expression mild despair. “Do really believe, Diamond, house moon, beautiful lady crooked old man dusters it?” “If not, something better,” answered, vanished leaves heads. I went house, I visited often evenings. When I came out, little wind blowing, pleasant heat day, although late summer now, still hot. The tree-tops swinging it. I took way past beech, called see Diamond still nest rocking head. “Are there, Diamond?” I said. “Yes, sir,” came clear voice reply. “Is growing dark get safely?” “Oh, no, sir--if I take time it. I know way well, never let go one hand till I good hold other.” “Do careful,” I insisted--foolishly, seeing boy careful could already. “I coming,” returned. “I got moon I want to-night.” I heard rustling rustling drawing nearer nearer. Three four minutes elapsed, appeared length creeping little ladder. I took arms, set ground. “Thank you, sir,” said. “That north wind blowing, it, sir?” “I cannot tell,” I answered. “It feels cool kind, I think may be. But I could sure except stronger, gentle wind might turn way amongst trunks trees.” “I shall know I get room,” said Diamond. “I think I hear mistress's bell. Good-night, sir.” He ran house, I went home. His mistress rung send bed, careful I daresay thought looking well. When reached room, opened windows, one looked north east, find wind blew. It blew right northern window. Diamond glad, thought perhaps North Wind would come now: real north wind never blown time since left London. But, always came herself, never looking her, indeed almost never thinking her, shut east window, went bed. Perhaps readers may wonder could go sleep expectation; and, indeed, I known him, I wondered myself; one peculiarities, seemed nothing strange him. He full quietness could go sleep almost time, composed let sleep come. This time went fast asleep usual. But woke dim blue night. The moon vanished. He thought heard knocking door. “Somebody wants me,” said himself, jumping bed, ran open it. But one there. He closed again, and, noise still continuing, found another door room rattling. It belonged closet, thought, never able open it. The wind blowing window must shaking it. He would go see so. The door opened quite easily, surprise, instead closet found long narrow room. The moon, sinking west, shone open window end. The room low coved ceiling, occupied whole top house, immediately roof. It quite empty. The yellow light half-moon streamed dark floor. He delighted discovery strange, desolate, moonlit place close snug little room, began dance skip floor. The wind came door left open, blew danced, kept turning towards might blow face. He kept picturing many places, lovely desolate, hill-sides farm-yards tree-tops meadows, blown way The Mound. And danced, grew delighted motion wind; feet grew stronger, body lighter, length seemed borne air, could almost fly. So strong feeling become, last began doubt whether one precious dreams often had, floated air will. But something made look up, unspeakable delight, found uplifted hands lying North Wind, dancing him, round round long bare room, hair falling floor, filling arched ceiling, eyes shining like thinking stars, sweetest grand smiles playing breezily beautiful mouth. She was, often before, height rather tall lady. She stoop order dance him, held hands high hers. When saw her, gave one spring, arms neck, arms holding bosom. The moment swept open window moon shining, made circuit like bird alight, settled nest top great beech-tree. There placed lap began hush baby, Diamond entirely happy care speak word. At length, however, found going sleep, would lose much, that, pleasant was, could consent. “Please, dear North Wind,” said, “I happy I afraid dream. How I know dream?” “What matter?” returned North Wind. “I should, cry” said Diamond. “But cry? The dream, dream, pleasant one--is not?” “That I want true.” “Have forgotten said Nanny dream?” “It dream itself--I mean, pleasure it,” answered Diamond, “for I that, whether dream not; you, North Wind; I cannot bear find dream, I lose you. You would nobody then, I could bear that. You dream, you, dear North Wind? Do say No, else I shall cry, come awake, gone ever. I dare dream anybody.” “I either dream, something better dream, Diamond,” said North Wind, rather sorrowful tone, thought. “But something better--it I want, North Wind,” persisted, already beginning cry little. She made answer, rose arms sailed away tree-tops till came meadow, flock sheep feeding. “Do remember song singing week ago says Bo-Peep--how lost sheep, got twice many lambs?” asked North Wind, sitting grass, placing lap before. “Oh yes, I do, well enough,” answered Diamond; “but I never quite liked rhyme.” “Why not, child?” “Because seems say one's good another, two new ones better one lost. I thinking great deal, seems although one sixpence good sixpence, twenty lambs would instead one sheep whose face knew. Somehow, looked anybody's eyes, right deep them, I mean, nobody one more. Nobody, ever beautiful good, make one going sight. So see, North Wind, I cannot help frightened think perhaps I dreaming, nowhere all. Do tell own, real, beautiful North Wind.” Again rose, shot air, uneasy could answer him; Diamond lay quiet arms, waiting would say. He tried see face, dreadfully afraid answering could say dream; let hair fall face could see it. This frightened still more. “Do speak, North Wind,” said last. “I never speak I nothing say,” replied. “Then I think must real North Wind, dream,” said Diamond. “But I looking something say time.” “But I want say hard find. If say one word comfort true, I know must dream, great beautiful lady like could never tell lie.” “But might know say say, little boy like would understand it,” said North Wind. “Here, let us get again, I try tell I think. You musn't suppose I able answer questions, though. There great many things I understand do.” She descended grassy hillock, midst wild furzy common. There rabbit-warren underneath, rabbits came holes, moonlight, looking sober wise, like patriarchs standing tent-doors, looking going bed. When saw North Wind, instead turning round vanishing thump heels, cantered slowly snuffled long upper lips, moved every way once. That way kissing her; and, talked Diamond, would every stroke furry backs, lift play long ears. They would, Diamond thought, leaped upon lap, already. “I think,” said she, sitting silent while, “that I dream, would able love so. You love me, you?” “Indeed I do,” answered Diamond, stroking hand. “I see! I see! How could I able love I all, know? Besides, I could able dream anything half beautiful head; I did, I could love fancy like that, could I?” “I think not. You might loved dream, dreamily, forgotten woke, I daresay, loved like real love me. Even then, I think could dream anything something real like somewhere. But seen many shapes, Diamond: remember I wolf once--do you?” “Oh yes--a good wolf frightened naughty drunken nurse.” “Well, suppose I turn ugly, would rather I dream then?” “Yes; I know beautiful inside same. You would love me, I love same. I like look ugly, know. But I believe bit.” “Not saw it?” “No, I saw ever plain.” “There Diamond! I tell I know then. I think I fancy be. I shape various ways various people. But heart true. People call dreadful names, think know me. But not. Sometimes call Bad Fortune, sometimes Evil Chance, sometimes Ruin; another name think dreadful all.” “What that?” asked Diamond, smiling face. “I tell name. Do remember go get country back?” “Oh yes, I do. How cold were, North Wind! white, lovely eyes! My heart grew like lump ice, I forgot while.” “You near knowing call then. Would afraid go again?” “No. Why I? Indeed I glad enough, get another peep country back.” “You never seen yet.” “Have I, North Wind? Oh! I sorry! I thought I had. What I see then?” “Only picture it. The real country real back ever much beautiful that. You shall see one day--perhaps long.” “Do sing songs there?” “Do remember dream little boys dug stars?” “Yes, I do. I thought must something dream, beautiful.” “Yes; I gave dream.” “Oh! thank you. Did give Nanny dream too--about moon bees?” “Yes. I lady sat window moon.” “Oh, thank you. I almost sure something too. And tell Mr. Raymond story Princess Daylight?” “I believe I something it. At events thought one night could sleep. But I want ask whether remember song boy-angels sang dream yours.” “No. I could keep it, I would, I try.” “That fault.” “How could be, North Wind?” “Because I know properly myself, I could teach you. I could make rough guess something like would be, I able make dream hard enough remember it. Nor would I done I could, correct. I made dream pictures it, though. But hear song get back of----” “My dear North Wind,” said Diamond, finishing sentence her, kissing arm held leaning her. “And settled this--for time, least,” said North Wind. “But I cannot feel quite sure yet,” said Diamond. “You must wait that. Meantime may hopeful, content quite sure. Come now, I take home again, tire much.” “Oh, no, no. I least tired,” pleaded Diamond. “It better, though.” “Very well; wish it,” yielded Diamond sigh. “You dear good, boy” said North Wind. “I come to-morrow night take longer time. We shall make little journey together, fact, shall start earlier, moon later, shall little moonlight way.” She rose, swept meadow trees. In moments Mound appeared them. She sank little, floated window Diamond's room. There laid bed, covered over, moment lapt dreamless sleep. CHAPTER XXXVII. ONCE MORE THE next night Diamond seated open window, head hand, rather tired, eagerly waiting promised visit afraid could sleep. But started suddenly, found already asleep. He rose, looking window saw something white beech-tree. It North Wind. She holding one hand top branch. Her hair garments went floating away behind tree, whose top swaying others still. “Are ready, Diamond?” asked. “Yes,” answered Diamond, “quite ready.” In moment window, arms came took him. She sailed away swiftly could first mark nothing speed clouds dim earth went rushing past. But soon began see sky lovely, mottled clouds moon, threw faint colours like mother-of-pearl, opal. The night warm, lady's arms feel wind making waves ripe corn, ripples rivers lakes. At length descended side open earthy hill, where, beneath stone, spring came bubbling out. “I going take along little brook,” said North Wind. “I wanted anything else to-night, I give treat.” She stooped stream holding Diamond close surface it, glided along level flow ran hill. And song brook came Diamond's ears, grew grew changed every turn. It seemed Diamond singing story life him. And was. It began musical tinkle changed babble gentle rushing. Sometimes song would almost cease, break again, tinkle, babble, rush, once. At bottom hill came small river, brook flowed muffled merry sound. Along surface river, darkly clear moonlight, floated; now, widened little lake, would hover moment bed water-lilies, watch swing about, folded sleep, water leaned swayed presence North Wind; would watch fishes asleep among roots below. Sometimes would hold Diamond deep hollow curving bank, might look far cool stillness. Sometimes would leave river sweep across clover-field. The bees home, clover asleep. Then would return follow river. It grew wider wider went. Now armies wheat oats would hang rush opposite banks; willows would dip low branches still waters; would lead stately trees grassy banks lovely garden, roses lilies asleep, tender flowers quite folded up, wide-awake sending life sweet, strong odours. Wider wider grew stream, came upon boats lying along banks, rocked little flutter North Wind's garments. Then came houses banks, standing lovely lawn, grand trees; parts river high grass roots trees water, Diamond, glided stems, could see grass bottom water. Then would leave river float houses, one another--beautiful rich houses, which, like fine trees, taken centuries grow. There scarcely light seen, movement heard: people lay fast asleep. “What lot dreams must dreaming!” said Diamond. “Yes,” returned North Wind. “They cannot surely lies--can they?” “I think depends little dreams them,” suggested Diamond. “Yes,” said North Wind. “The people think lies, lies, likely dream lies. But people love true surely dream true things. But something depends whether dreams home-grown, whether seed blown somebody else's garden-wall. Ah! one awake house!” They floating past window light burning. Diamond heard moan, looked anxiously North Wind's face. “It lady,” said North Wind. “She cannot sleep pain.” “Could something her?” said Diamond. “No, I cannot. But could.” “What could I do?” “Sing little song her.” “She would hear me.” “I take in, hear you.” “But would rude, would it? You go please, course, I business room.” “You may trust me, Diamond. I shall take good care lady you. The window open. Come.” By shaded lamp, lady seated white wrapper, trying read, moaning every minute. North Wind floated behind chair, set Diamond down, told sing something. He little frightened, thought while, sang:-- The sun gone down, And moon's sky; But sun come up, And moon laid by. The flower asleep But dead; When morning shines, It lift head. When winter comes, It die--no, no; It hide From frost snow. Sure summer, Sure sun; The night winter Are shadows run. The lady never lifted eyes book, head hand. As soon Diamond finished, North Wind lifted carried away. “Did lady hear me?” asked Diamond floating river. “Oh, yes, heard you,” answered North Wind. “Was frightened then?” “Oh, no.” “Why look see was?” “She know there.” “How could hear then?” “She hear ears.” “What hear with?” “With heart.” “Where think words came from?” “She thought came book reading. She search to-morrow find them, able understand all.” “Oh, fun!” said Diamond. “What do?” “I tell do: never forget meaning them; never able remember words them.” “If sees Mr. Raymond's book, puzzle her, it?” “Yes, will. She never able understand it.” “Until gets back north wind,” suggested Diamond. “Until gets back north wind,” assented lady. “Oh!” cried Diamond, “I know are. Oh! let go old garden, mother's room, Diamond's stall. I wonder hole back bed still. I like stay rest night. It take long get home here, it, North Wind?” “No,” answered; “you shall stay long like.” “Oh, jolly,” cried Diamond, North Wind sailed house him, set lawn back. Diamond ran lawn little moonlight. He found part cut flower-beds, little summer-house coloured glass great elm-tree gone. He like this, ran stable. There horses all. He ran upstairs. The rooms empty. The thing left cared hole wall little bed stood; enough make wish stop. He ran stair again, upon lawn. There threw began cry. It dreary lost! “I thought I liked place much,” said Diamond himself, “but I find I care it. I suppose people make like place, gone, dead, care bit it. North Wind told I might stop long I liked, I stopped longer already. North Wind!” cried aloud, turning face towards sky. The moon cloud, looking dull dismal. A star shot sky, fell grass beside him. The moment lighted, stood North Wind. “Oh!” cried Diamond, joyfully, “were shooting star?” “Yes, child.” “Did hear call then?” “Yes.” “So high that?” “Yes; I heard quite well.” “Do take home.” “Have enough old home already?” “Yes, enough. It home now.” “I thought would it,” said North Wind. “Everything, dreaming all, got soul it, else worth nothing, care bit it. Some thoughts worth nothing, got soul them. The brain puts mind, mind brain.” “But know that, North Wind? You got body.” “If I would know anything me. No creature know another without help body. But I care talk that. It time go home.” So saying, North Wind lifted Diamond bore away. CHAPTER XXXVIII. AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND I DID see Diamond week this, told I told you. I astonished able even report conversations said North Wind, I known already children profound metaphysics. But fear crosses me, lest, telling much friend, I lead people mistake one consequential, priggish little monsters, always trying say clever things, looking see whether people appreciate them. When child like dies, instead silly book written him, stuffed like one awful big-headed fishes see museums. But Diamond never troubled head people thought him. He never set knowing better others. The wisest things said came wanted one help difficulty in. He even offended Nanny Jim calling silly. He supposed something it, though could quite understand what. I suspect however name gave him, God's Baby, share reconciling it. Happily me, I much interested metaphysics Diamond himself, therefore, recounted conversations North Wind, I find strange sea, although certainly I could always feel bottom, indeed convinced bottom miles away. “Could dreaming, think, sir?” asked anxiously. “I dare say, Diamond,” I answered. “But least one thing may sure of, still better love wonderful call North Wind. Even dream, dream beautiful creature could come chance.” “Yes, I know,” returned Diamond; “I know.” Then silent, but, I confess, appeared thoughtful satisfied. The next time I saw him, looked paler usual. “Have seen friend again?” I asked him. “Yes,” answered, solemnly. “Did take her?” “No. She speak me. I woke once, I generally I going see her, door big room, sitting I saw sit doorstep, white snow, eyes blue heart iceberg. She looked me, never moved spoke.” “Were afraid?” I asked. “No. Why I been?” answered. “I felt little cold.” “Did stay long?” “I know. I fell asleep again. I think I rather cold ever since though,” added smile. I quite like this, I said nothing. Four days after, I called Mound. The maid opened door looked grave, I suspected nothing. When I reached drawing-room, I saw Mrs. Raymond crying. “Have heard?” said, seeing questioning looks. “I heard nothing,” I answered. “This morning found dear little Diamond lying floor big attic-room, outside door--fast asleep, thought. But took up, think asleep. We saw that----” Here kind-hearted lady broke crying afresh. “May I go see him?” I asked. “Yes,” sobbed. “You know way top tower.” I walked winding stair, entered room. A lovely figure, white almost clear alabaster, lying bed. I saw was. They thought dead. I knew gone back north wind.
