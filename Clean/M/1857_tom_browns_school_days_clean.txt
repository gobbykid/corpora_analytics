 TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS PART I. CHAPTER I--THE BROWN FAMILY “I Poet White Horse Vale, sir, With liberal notions cap.”--Ballad The Browns become illustrious pen Thackeray pencil Doyle, within memory young gentlemen matriculating universities. Notwithstanding well-merited late fame fallen upon them, one acquainted family must feel much yet written said British nation properly sensible much greatness owes Browns. For centuries, quiet, dogged, homespun way, subduing earth English counties, leaving mark American forests Australian uplands. Wherever fleets armies England renown, stalwart sons Browns done yeomen's work. With yew bow cloth-yard shaft Cressy Agincourt--with brown bill pike brave Lord Willoughby--with culverin demi-culverin Spaniards Dutchmen--with hand-grenade sabre, musket bayonet, Rodney St. Vincent, Wolfe Moore, Nelson Wellington, carried lives hands, getting hard knocks hard work plenty--which whole looked for, best thing them--and little praise pudding, indeed they, us, better without. Talbots Stanleys, St. Maurs, such-like folk, led armies made laws time mind; noble families would somewhat astounded--if accounts ever came fairly taken--to find small work England side Browns. These latter, indeed, have, present generation, rarely sung poet, chronicled sage. They wanted sacer vates, solid rise top themselves, largely gifted talent catching hold of, holding tight to, whatever good things happened going--the foundation fortunes many noble families. But world goes way, wheel turns, wrongs Browns, like wrongs, seem fair way get righted. And present writer, many years life devout Brown-worshipper, and, moreover, honour nearly connected eminently respectable branch great Brown family, anxious, far lies, help wheel over, throw stone pile. However, gentle reader, simple reader, whichever may be, lest led waste precious time upon pages, I make bold tell sort folk meet put with, I jog comfortably together. You shall hear sort folk Browns are--at least branch them; then, like sort, why, cut concern once, let I cry quits either us grumble other. In first place, Browns fighting family. One may question wisdom, wit, beauty, fight question. Wherever hard knocks kind, visible invisible, going; Brown nearest must shove carcass. And carcasses, part, answer well characteristic propensity: squareheaded snake-necked generation, broad shoulder, deep chest, thin flank, carrying lumber. Then clanship, bad Highlanders; amazing belief one another. With nothing like Browns, third fourth generation. “Blood thicker water,” one pet sayings. They cannot happy unless always meeting one another. Never people family gatherings; which, stranger, sensitive, might think better gathered together. For whole time together luxuriate telling one another minds whatever subject turns up; minds wonderfully antagonistic, opinions downright beliefs. Till among time understand them, cannot think quarrelling. Not bit it. They love respect one another ten times good set family arguing bout, go back, one curacy, another chambers, another regiment, freshened work, ever convinced Browns height company. This family training, too, combined turn combativeness, makes eminently quixotic. They cannot let anything alone think going wrong. They must speak mind it, annoying easy-going folk, spend time money tinker it, however hopeless job. It impossibility Brown leave disreputable lame dog side stile. Most folk get tired work. The old Browns, red faces, white whiskers, bald heads, go believing fighting green old age. They always crotchet going, till old man scythe reaps garners away troublesome old boys are. And provoking thing is, failures knock up, make hold hands, think you, me, sane people right. Failures slide like July rain duck's back feathers. Jem whole family turn bad, cheat one week, next thing Jack; goes treadmill, wife children workhouse, lookout Bill take place. However, time us get general particular; so, leaving great army Browns, scattered whole empire sun never sets, whose general diffusion I take chief empire's stability; let us fix attention upon small nest Browns hero hatched, dwelt portion royal county Berks called Vale White Horse. Most probably travelled Great Western Railway far Swindon. Those eyes open aware, soon leaving Didcot station, fine range chalk hills running parallel railway left-hand side go down, distant two three miles, less, line. The highest point range White Horse Hill, come front stop Shrivenham station. If love English scenery, hours spare, cannot better, next time pass, stop Farringdon Road Shrivenham station, make way highest point. And care vague old stories haunt country-sides England, not, wise, content hours' stay; for, glorious view is, neighbourhood yet interesting relics bygone times. I know two English neighbourhoods thoroughly, each, within circle five miles, enough interest beauty last reasonable man life. I believe case almost throughout country, special attraction, none richer one I speaking going introduce particularly, subject I must prosy; care England detail may skip chapter. O young England! young England! born racing railroad times, Great Exhibition, monster sight, every year, get couple thousand miles ground three pound ten five-weeks' holiday, know birthplaces? You ends earth, seems me, soon get necks educational collar, midsummer holidays, long vacations, not--going round Ireland, return ticket, fortnight; dropping copies Tennyson tops Swiss mountains; pulling Danube Oxford racing boats. And get home quiet fortnight, turn steam off, lie backs paternal garden, surrounded last batch books Mudie's library, half bored death. Well, well! I know good side. You patter French less, perhaps German; seen men cities, doubt, opinions, are, schools painting, high art, that; seen pictures Dresden Louvre, know taste sour krout. All I say is, know lanes woods fields. Though may choke-full science, one twenty knows find wood-sorrel, bee-orchis, grow next wood, three miles off, bog-bean wood-sage good for. And country legends, stories old gable-ended farmhouses, place last skirmish fought civil wars, parish butts stood, last highwayman turned bay, last ghost laid parson, gone date altogether. Now, time, got home old coach, put us cross-roads boxes, first day holidays, driven family coachman, singing “Dulce Domum” top voices, were, fixtures, till black Monday came round. We cut amusements within walk ride home. And got know country folk ways songs stories heart, went fields woods hills, again, till made friends all. We Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Yorkshire boys; young cosmopolites, belonging countries countries. No doubt right; I dare say is. This day large views, glorious humanity, that; I wish back-sword play gone Vale White Horse, confounded Great Western carried away Alfred's Hill make embankment. But return said Vale White Horse, country first scenes true interesting story laid. As I said, Great Western runs right it, land large, rich pastures bounded ox-fences, covered fine hedgerow timber, nice little gorse spinney, abideth poor Charley, cover betake miles miles, pushed fine November morning old Berkshire. Those there, well mounted, know stanch little pack dash him--heads high sterns low, breast-high scent--can consume ground times. There little ploughland, woods, Vale average sporting country, except hunting. The villages straggling, queer, old-fashioned places, houses dropped without least regularity, nooks out-of-the-way corners, sides shadowy lanes footpaths, patch garden. They built chiefly good gray stone, thatched; though I see within last year two red-brick cottages multiplying, Vale beginning manufacture largely bricks tiles. There lots waste ground side roads every village, amounting often village greens, feed pigs ganders people; roads old-fashioned, homely roads, dirty badly made, hardly endurable winter, still pleasant jog-trot roads running great pasture-lands, dotted little clumps thorns, sleek kine feeding, fence either side them, gate end field, makes get gig (if keep one), gives chance looking every quarter mile. One moralists sat youth--was great Richard Swiveller, Mr. Stiggins--says, “We born vale, must take consequences found situation.” These consequences I, one, ready encounter. I pity people born vale. I mean flat country; vale--that is, flat country bounded hills. The hill always view choose turn towards him--that essence vale. There ever distance, friend companion. You never lose hilly districts. And hill White Horse Hill! There stands right rest, nine hundred feet sea, boldest, bravest shape chalk hill ever saw. Let us go top him, see found there. Ay, may well wonder think odd never heard before; wonder not, please, hundreds things lying England, wiser folk know nothing of, care nothing for. Yes, magnificent Roman camp, mistake, gates ditch mounds, complete twenty years strong old rogues left it. Here, right highest point, say see eleven counties, trenched round table-land, twelve fourteen acres, custom, could bear anybody overlook them, made eyrie. The ground falls away rapidly sides. Was ever turf whole world? You sink ankles every step, yet spring delicious. There always breeze “camp,” called; lies, Romans left it, except cairn east side, left Majesty's corps sappers miners day, engineer officer finished sojourn there, surveys ordnance map Berkshire. It altogether place forget, place open man's soul, make prophesy, looks great Vale spread garden Lord him, wave wave mysterious downs behind, right left chalk hills running away distance, along trace miles old Roman road, “the Ridgeway” (“the Rudge,” country folk call it), keeping straight along highest back hills--such place Balak brought Balaam to, told prophesy people valley beneath. And could not, neither shall you, people Lord abide there. And leave camp, descend towards west, Ashdown. We treading heroes. It sacred ground Englishmen--more sacred one two fields bones lie whitening. For actual place Alfred great battle, battle Ashdown (“Aescendum” chroniclers), broke Danish power, made England Christian land. The Danes held camp slope standing--the whole crown hill, fact. “The heathen beforehand seized higher ground,” old Asser says, wasted everything behind London, ready burst fair Vale, Alfred's birthplace heritage. And heights came Saxons, Alma. “The Christians led line lower ground. There stood also spot single thorn-tree, marvellous stumpy (which eyes seen).” Bless old chronicler! Does think nobody ever saw “single thorn-tree” himself? Why, stands day, edge slope, I saw three weeks since--an old single thorn-tree, “marvellous stumpy.” At least, tree ought been, place battle must lost--“around which, I saying, two lines foemen came together battle huge shout. And place one two kings heathen five earls fell died, many thousands heathen side place.” * After crowning mercy, pious king, might never wanting sign memorial country-side, carved northern side chalk hill, camp, almost precipitous, great Saxon White Horse, may see railway, gives name Vale, looked thousand years more. * “Pagani editiorem Iocum praeoccupaverant. Christiani ab inferiori loco aciem dirigebant. Erat quoque eodem loco unica spinosa arbor, brevis admodum (quam nos ipsi nostris propriis oculis vidimus). Circa quam ergo hostiles inter se acies cum ingenti clamore hostiliter conveniunt. Quo loco alter de duobus Paganorum regibus et quinque comites occisi occubuerunt, et multa millia Paganae partis eodem loco. Cecidit illic ergo Boegsceg Rex, et Sidroc ille senex comes, et Sidroc Junior comes, et Obsbern comes,” etc.-- Annales Rerum Gestarum AElfredi Magni, Auctore Asserio. Recensuit Franciscus Wise. Oxford, 1722, p.23. Right White Horse curious deep broad gully called “the Manger,” one side hills fall series lovely sweeping curves, known “the Giant's Stairs.” They bit like stairs, I never saw anything like anywhere else, short green turf, tender bluebells, gossamer thistle-down gleaming sun sheep-paths running along sides like ruled lines. The side Manger formed Dragon's Hill, curious little round self-confident fellow, thrown forward range, utterly unlike everything round him. On hill deliverer mankind--St. George, country folk used tell me--killed dragon. Whether St. George, I cannot say; surely dragon killed there, may see marks yet blood ran down, token place ran easiest way hillside. Passing along Ridgeway west mile, come little clump young beech firs, growth thorn privet underwood. Here may find nests strong partridge peewit, take care keeper upon you; middle old cromlech, huge flat stone raised seven eight others, led path, large single stones set side. This Wayland Smith's cave, place classic fame now; Sir Walter touched it, I may well let alone, refer “Kenilworth” legend. The thick, deep wood see hollow, mile off, surrounds Ashdown Park, built Inigo Jones. Four broad alleys cut wood circumference centre, leads one face house. The mystery downs hangs house wood, stand alone, unlike around, green slopes studded great stones part, stretching away sides. It wise Lord Craven, I think, pitched tent there. Passing along Ridgeway east, soon come cultivated land. The downs, strictly called, more. Lincolnshire farmers imported, long, fresh slopes sheep-walks more, grow famous turnips barley. One improvers lives “Seven Barrows” farm, another mystery great downs. There barrows still, solemn silent, like ships calm sea, sepulchres sons men. But whom? It three miles White Horse--too far slain Ashdown buried there. Who shall say heroes waiting there? But must get Vale again, away Great Western Railway town, time printer's devil press, terrible long slippery descent, shocking bad road. At bottom, however, pleasant public; whereat must really take modest quencher, air provocative thirst. So pull old oak stands door. “What name hill, landlord?” “Blawing STWUN Hill, sir, sure.” [READER. “Stuym?” AUTHOR: “Stone, stupid--the Blowing Stone.”] “And house? I cannot make sign.” “Blawing Stwun, sir,” says landlord, pouring old ale Toby Philpot jug, melodious crash, long-necked glass. “What queer names!” say we, sighing end draught, holding glass replenished. “Bean't queer all, I see, sir,” says mine host, handing back glass, “seeing Blawing Stwun, self,” putting hand square lump stone, three feet half high, perforated two three queer holes, like petrified antediluvian rat-holes, lies close oak, nose. We ever puzzled, drink second glass ale, wondering come next. “Like hear un, sir?” says mine host, setting Toby Philpot tray, resting hands “Stwun.” We ready anything; he, without waiting reply, applies mouth one ratholes. Something must come it, burst. Good heavens! I hope apoplectic tendencies. Yes, comes, sure enough, gruesome sound moan roar, spreads away valley, hillside, woods back house, ghost-like, awful voice. “Um say, sir,” says mine host, rising purple-faced, moan still coming Stwun, “as used old times warn country-side blawing Stwun enemy a-comin', folks could make un heered seven mile round; leastways, I heered Lawyer Smith say, knows smart sight old times.” We hardly swallow Lawyer Smith's seven miles; could blowing stone summons, sort sending fiery cross round neighbourhood old times? What old times? Who knows? We pay beer, thankful. “And name village below, landlord?” “Kingstone Lisle, sir.” “Fine plantations got here?” “Yes, sir; Squire's 'mazing fond trees like.” “No wonder. He got real beauties fond of. Good-day, landlord.” “Good-day, sir, pleasant ride 'ee.” And now, boys, I want get readers, enough? Will give once, say convinced, let begin story, it? Remember, I little bit hillside yet--what could ride round easily ponies hour. I come Vale, Blowing Stone Hill; I begin Vale, stop me? You hear Wantage, birthplace Alfred, Farringdon, held long Charles First (the Vale near Oxford, dreadfully malignant--full Throgmortons, Puseys, Pyes, like; brawny retainers). Did ever read Thomas Ingoldsby's “Legend Hamilton Tighe”? If not, ought have. Well, Farringdon lived, went sea; real name Hamden Pye, Pyes great folk Farringdon. Then Pusey. You heard Pusey horn, King Canute gave Puseys day, gallant old squire, lately gone rest (whom Berkshire freeholders turned last Parliament, eternal disgrace, voting according conscience), used bring high days, holidays, bonfire nights. And splendid old cross church Uffington, Uffingas town. How whole countryside teems Saxon names memories! And old moated grange Compton, nestled close hillside, twenty Marianas may lived, bright water-lilies moat, yew walk, “the cloister walk,” peerless terraced gardens. There are, twenty things beside, care them, eyes. And sort things may find, I believe, every one you, common English country neighbourhood. Will look noses, not? Well, well, I done I make you; go gadding half Europe now, every holidays, I cannot help it. I born bred west-country man, thank God! Wessex man, citizen noblest Saxon kingdom Wessex, regular “Angular Saxon,” soul adscriptus glebae. There nothing like old country-side me, music like twang real old Saxon tongue, one gets fresh veritable chaw White Horse Vale; I say “Gaarge Ridler,” old west-country yeoman,-- “Throo aall waarld owld Gaarge would bwoast, Commend merry owld England mwoast; While vools gwoes prating vur nigh, We stwops whum, dog I.” Here, rate, lived stopped home Squire Brown, J.P. county Berks, village near foot White Horse range. And dealt justice mercy rough way, begat sons daughters, hunted fox, grumbled badness roads times. And wife dealt stockings, calico shirts, smock frocks, comforting drinks old folks “rheumatiz,” good counsel all; kept coal clothes' clubs going, yule-tide, bands mummers came round, dressed ribbons coloured paper caps, stamped round Squire's kitchen, repeating true sing-song vernacular legend St. George fight, ten-pound doctor, plays part healing Saint--a relic, I believe, old Middle-age mysteries. It first dramatic representation greeted eyes little Tom, brought kitchen nurse witness it, mature age three years. Tom eldest child parents, earliest babyhood exhibited family characteristics great strength. He hearty, strong boy first, given fighting escaping nurse, fraternizing village boys, made expeditions round neighbourhood. And here, quiet old-fashioned country village, shadow everlasting hills, Tom Brown reared, never left till went first school, nearly eight years age, days change air twice year thought absolutely necessary health Majesty's lieges. I credibly informed, inclined believe, various boards directors railway companies, gigantic jobbers bribers, quarrelling everything else, agreed together ten years back buy learned profession medicine, body soul. To end set apart several millions money, continually distribute judiciously among doctors, stipulating one thing, shall prescribe change air every patient pay, borrow money pay, railway fare, see prescription carried out. If this, none us well home year together? It twenty years ago, bit it. The Browns go country five years. A visit Reading Abingdon twice year, assizes quarter sessions, Squire made horse pair saddle-bags containing wardrobe, stay day two country neighbour's, expedition county ball yeomanry review, made sum Brown locomotion years. A stray Brown distant county dropped every then; Oxford, grave nag, old don, contemporary Squire; looked upon Brown household villagers sort feeling regard man crossed Rocky Mountains, launched boat Great Lake Central Africa. The White Horse Vale, remember, traversed great road--nothing country parish roads, bad. Only one coach ran there, one Wantage London, western part Vale without regular means moving on, certainly seem want them. There canal, way, supplied country-side coal, continually went long barges, big black men lounging side horses along towing-path, women bright-coloured handkerchiefs standing sterns steering. Standing I say, could never see whether standing sitting, heads shoulders sight cozy little cabins occupied eight feet stern, Tom Brown pictured desirable residences. His nurse told good-natured-looking women constant habit enticing children barges, taking London selling them, Tom would believe, made resolve soon possible accept oft-proffered invitation sirens “young master” come ride. But yet nurse much Tom. Yet I, all, abuse gadabout propensities countrymen? We vagabond nation now, certain, better worse. I vagabond; I away home less five distinct times last year. The Queen sets us example: moving top bottom. Little dirty Jack, abides Clement's Inn gateway, blacks boots penny, takes month's hop-picking every year matter course. Why he? I delighted it. I love vagabonds, I prefer poor rich ones. Couriers ladies'-maids, imperials travelling carriages, abomination unto me; I cannot away them. But dirty Jack, every good fellow who, words capital French song, moves about, “Comme le limacon, Portant tout son bagage, Ses meubles, sa maison,” back, why, good luck them, many merry roadside adventure, steaming supper chimney corners roadside inns, Swiss chalets, Hottentot kraals, wherever else like go. So, succeeded contradicting first chapter (which gives great hopes go on, think good fellow notwithstanding crotchets), I shall shut present, consider ways; resolved “sar' out,” say Vale, “holus bolus” comes, probably get truth me. CHAPTER II--THE “VEAST.” “And King commandeth forbiddeth, henceforth neither fairs markets kept Churchyards, honour Church.”--STATUTES : 13 Edw. I. Stat. II. cap. vi. As venerable learned poet (whose voluminous works think correct thing admire talk about, read often) truly says, “The child father man;” fortiori, therefore, must father boy. So going rate see Tom Brown boyhood, supposing never get farther (which, show proper sense value history, knowing may), let us look life environments child quiet country village introduced last chapter. Tom, already said, robust combative urchin, age four began struggle yoke authority nurse. That functionary good-hearted, tearful, scatter-brained girl, lately taken Tom's mother, Madam Brown, called, village school trained nurserymaid. Madam Brown rare trainer servants, spent freely profession; profession was, gave trouble half many people take earn good income. Her servants known sought miles round. Almost girls attained certain place village school taken her, one two time, housemaids, laundrymaids, nurserymaids, kitchenmaids, year two's training started life amongst neighbouring families, good principles wardrobes. One results system perpetual despair Mrs. Brown's cook maid, sooner notable girl made hands missus sure find good place send off, taking fresh importations school. Another was, house always full young girls, clean, shining faces, broke plates scorched linen, made atmosphere cheerful, homely life place, good every one came within influence. Mrs. Brown loved young people, fact human creatures general, plates linen. They like lot elder children servants, felt mother aunt mistress. Tom's nurse one took instruction slowly--she seemed two left hands head; Mrs. Brown kept longer usual, might expend awkwardness forgetfulness upon would judge punish strictly them. Charity Lamb name. It immemorial habit village christen children either Bible names, cardinal virtues; one ever hearing village street green, shrill sounds “Prudence! Prudence! thee cum' gutter;” or, “Mercy! drat girl, bist thee a-doing wi' little Faith?” Ruths, Rachels, Keziahs, every corner. The boys: Benjamins, Jacobs, Noahs, Enochs. I suppose custom come Puritan times. There is, rate, strong still Vale. Well, early morning till dewy eve, cold tub putting bed, Charity Tom pitted one another. Physical power yet side Charity, chance wherever headwork wanted. This war independence began every morning breakfast, Charity escorted charge neighbouring farmhouse, supplied Browns, where, mother's wish, Master Tom went drink whey breakfast. Tom sort objection whey, decided liking curds, forbidden unwholesome; seldom morning manage secure handful hard curds, defiance Charity farmer's wife. The latter good soul gaunt, angular woman, who, old black bonnet top head, strings dangling shoulders, gown tucked pocket-holes, went clattering dairy, cheese-room, yard, high pattens. Charity sort niece old lady's, consequently free farmhouse garden, could resist going purposes gossip flirtation heir-apparent, dawdling fellow, never work ought been. The moment Charity found cousin, occupation, Tom would slip away; minute shrill cries would heard dairy, “Charity, Charity, thee lazy huzzy, bist?” Tom would break cover, hands mouth full curds, take refuge shaky surface great muck reservoir middle yard, disturbing repose great pigs. Here safety, grown person could follow without getting knees; luckless Charity, aunt scolded dairy door, “allus hankering arter Willum, instead minding Master Tom,” would descend threats coaxing, lure Tom muck, rising shoes, would soon tell tale stockings, would sure catch missus's maid. Tom two abettors, shape couple old boys, Noah Benjamin name, defended Charity, expended much time upon education. They retired servants former generations Browns. Noah Crooke keen, dry old man almost ninety, still able totter about. He talked Tom quite one family, indeed long completely identified Browns himself. In remote age attendant Miss Brown, conveyed country pillion. He little round picture identical gray horse, caparisoned identical pillion, used sort fetish worship, abuse turnpike-roads carriages. He wore old full-bottomed wig, gift dandy old Brown valeted middle last century, habiliment Master Tom looked upon considerable respect, say fear; indeed whole feeling towards Noah strongly tainted awe. And old gentleman gathered fathers, Tom's lamentation unaccompanied certain joy seen last wig. “Poor old Noah, dead gone,” said he; “Tom Brown sorry. Put coffin, wig all.” But old Benjy young master's real delight refuge. He youth side Noah, scarce seventy years old--a cheery, humorous, kind-hearted old man, full sixty years Vale gossip, sorts helpful ways young old, children. It bent first pin Tom extracted first stickleback “Pebbly Brook,” little stream ran village. The first stickleback splendid fellow, fabulous red blue gills. Tom kept small basin till day death, became fisherman day. Within month taking first stickleback, Benjy carried hero canal, defiance Charity; them, whole afternoon's popjoying, caught three four small, coarse fish perch, averaging perhaps two half ounces each, Tom bore home rapture mother precious gift, received like true mother equal rapture, instructing cook nevertheless, private interview, prepare Squire's dinner. Charity appealed old Benjy meantime, representing dangers canal banks; Mrs. Brown, seeing boy's inaptitude female guidance, decided Benjy's favour, thenceforth old man Tom's dry nurse. And sat canal watching little green-and-white float, Benjy would instruct doings deceased Browns. How grandfather, early days great war, much distress crime Vale, magistrates threatened mob, ridden big stick hand, held petty sessions himself. How great-uncle, rector, encountered laid last ghost, frightened old women, male female, parish senses, turned blacksmith's apprentice disguised drink white sheet. It Benjy, too, saddled Tom's first pony, instructed mysteries horsemanship, teaching throw weight back keep hand low, stood chuckling outside door girls' school Tom rode little Shetland cottage round table, old dame pupils seated work. Benjy come family distinguished Vale prowess athletic games. Some half-dozen brothers kinsmen gone wars, one survived come home, small pension, three bullets different parts body; shared Benjy's cottage till death, left old dragoon's sword pistol, hung mantelpiece, flanked pair heavy single-sticks Benjy renown long ago old gamester, picked men Wiltshire Somersetshire, many good bout revels pastimes country-side. For famous back-swordman young days, good wrestler elbow collar. Back-swording wrestling serious holiday pursuits Vale--those men attained fame--and village champion. I suppose that, whole, people less worked now; rate, seemed time energy old pastimes. The great times back-swording came round year village; feast. The Vale “veasts” common statute feasts, much ancient business. They literally, far one ascertain, feasts dedication--that is, first established churchyard day village church opened public worship, wake festival patron saint, held day every year since time. There longer remembrance “veast” instituted, nevertheless pleasant almost sacred character own; children village, wherever scattered, tried get home holiday visit fathers mothers friends, bringing wages little gift country old folk. Perhaps day two before, rate “veast day” day after, village, might see strapping, healthy young men women parts country going round house house best clothes, finishing call Madam Brown, would consult putting earnings best advantage, best expend benefit old folk. Every household, however poor, managed raise “feast-cake” bottle ginger raisin wine, stood cottage table ready comers, unlikely make remember feast-time, feast-cake solid, full huge raisins. Moreover, feast-time day reconciliation parish. If Job Higgins Noah Freeman spoken last six months, “old women” would sure get patched day. And though good deal drinking low vice booths evening, pretty well confined would like, “veast veast;” whole, effect humanising Christian. In fact, reason case still gentlefolk farmers taken amusements, have, usual, forgotten poor. They attend feasts themselves, call disreputable; whereupon steadiest poor leave also, become called. Class amusements, dukes ploughboys, always become nuisances curses country. The true charm cricket hunting still less sociable universal; place every man come take part. No one village enjoyed approach “veast day” Tom, year taken old Benjy's tutelage. The feast held large green field lower end village. The road Farringdon ran along one side it, brook side road; brook another large, gentle, sloping pasture-land, footpath running churchyard; old church, originator mirth, towered gray walls lancet windows, overlooking sanctioning whole, though share therein forgotten. At point footpath crossed brook road, entered field feast held, long, low roadside inn; opposite side field large white thatched farmhouse, dwelt old sporting farmer, great promoter revels. Past old church, footpath, pottered old man child hand-in-hand early afternoon day feast, wandered round ground, already occupied “cheap Jacks,” green-covered carts marvellous assortment wares; booths legitimate small traders, tempting arrays fairings eatables; penny peep-shows shows, containing pink-eyed ladies, dwarfs, boa-constrictors, wild Indians. But object interest Benjy, course pupil also, stage rough planks four feet high, put village carpenter back-swording wrestling. And surveying whole tenderly, old Benjy led charge away roadside inn, ordered glass ale long pipe himself, discussed unwonted luxuries bench outside soft autumn evening mine host, another old servant Browns, speculated likelihood good show old gamesters contend morrow's prizes, told tales gallant bouts forty years back, Tom listened ears eyes. But shall tell joy next morning, church bells ringing merry peal, old Benjy appeared servants' hall, resplendent long blue coat brass buttons, pair old yellow buckskins top-boots cleaned inherited Tom's grandfather, stout thorn stick hand, nosegay pinks lavender buttonhole, led away Tom best clothes, two new shillings breeches-pockets? Those two, rate, look like enjoying day's revel. They quicken pace get churchyard, already see field thronged country folk; men clean, white smocks velveteen fustian coats, rough plush waistcoats many colours, women beautiful, long scarlet cloak--the usual out-door dress west-country women days, often descended families mother daughter--or new-fashioned stuff shawls, which, would believe it, become half well. The air resounds pipe tabor, drums trumpets showmen shouting doors caravans, tremendous pictures wonders seen within hang temptingly; rises shrill “root-too-too-too” Mr. Punch, unceasing pan-pipe satellite. “Lawk a' massey, Mr. Benjamin,” cries stout, motherly woman red cloak, enter field, “be you? Well, I never! You look purely. And Squire, madam, family?” Benjy graciously shakes hands speaker, left village years, come “veast” day visit old gossip, gently indicates heir-apparent Browns. “Bless little heart! I must gi' un kiss.--Here, Susannah, Susannah!” cries she, raising embrace, “come see Mr. Benjamin young Master Tom.--You minds Sukey, Mr. Benjamin; growed rare slip wench since seen her, though her'll sixteen come Martinmas. I aim take see madam get place.” And Sukey comes bouncing away knot old school-fellows, drops curtsey Mr. Benjamin. And elders come parts salute Benjy, girls madam's pupils kiss Master Tom. And carry load fairings; returns Benjy, hat coat covered ribbons, pockets crammed wonderful boxes open upon ever new boxes, popguns, trumpets, apples, gilt gingerbread stall Angel Heavens, sole vender thereof, whose booth groans kings queens, elephants prancing steeds, gleaming gold. There gold Angel's cakes ginger degenerate age. Skilled diggers might yet make fortune churchyards Vale, carefully washing dust consumers Angel's gingerbread. Alas! namesakes, receipts have, I fear, died him. And inspect penny peep-show--at least Tom does--while old Benjy stands outside gossips walks steps, enters mysterious doors pink-eyed lady Irish giant, means come pictures; boa swallow rabbit, rabbit waiting swallowed; expect tuppence? We easily pleased Vale. Now rush crowd, tinkling bell heard, shouts laughter; Master Tom mounts Benjy's shoulders, beholds jingling match glory. The games begun, opening them. It quaint game, immensely amusing look at; I know whether used counties, I better describe it. A large roped ring made, introduced dozen big boys young men mean play; carefully blinded turned loose ring, man introduced blindfolded; bell hung round neck, two hands tied behind him. Of course every time moves bell must ring, hand hold it; dozen blindfolded men catch him. This cannot always manage lively fellow, half always rush arms half, drive heads together, tumble over; crowd laughs vehemently, invents nicknames spur moment; they, choleric, tear handkerchiefs blind them, unfrequently pitch one another, thinking must run purpose. It great fun look jingling match certainly, Tom shouts jumps old Benjy's shoulders sight, old man feels weary, shifts strong young shoulders groom, got fun. And now, climbing pole another part field, muzzling flour-tub another, old farmer whose house, said, overlooks field, master revels, gets steps stage, announces may concern half-sovereign money forthcoming old gamester breaks heads; Squire added new hat. The amount prize sufficient stimulate men immediate neighbourhood, enough bring high talent distance; so, glance two round, tall fellow, shepherd, chucks hat stage climbs steps, looking rather sheepish. The crowd, course, first cheer, chaff usual, picks hat begins handling sticks see suit him. “Wooy, Willum Smith, thee canst plaay wi' arra daay,” says companion blacksmith's apprentice, stout young fellow nineteen twenty. Willum's sweetheart “veast” somewhere, strictly enjoined get head broke back-swording, pain highest displeasure; seen (the women pretend like see backsword play, keep away stage), hat decidedly getting old, chucks stage, follows himself, hoping break people's heads, that, all, Rachel really mind. Then follows greasy cap lined fur half-gipsy, poaching, loafing fellow, travels Vale much good, I fancy: “For twenty times Peter feared For Peter respected,” fact. And three four hats, including glossy castor Joe Willis, self-elected would-be champion neighbourhood, well-to-do young butcher twenty-eight thereabouts, great strapping fellow, full allowance bluster. This capital show gamesters, considering amount prize; so, picking sticks drawing lots, I think I must tell you, shortly I can, noble old game back-sword played; sadly gone late, even Vale, maybe never seen it. The weapon good stout ash stick large basket handle, heavier somewhat shorter common single-stick. The players called “old gamesters”--why, I cannot tell you--and object simply break one another's heads; moment blood runs inch anywhere eyebrow, old gamester belongs beaten, stop. A slight blow sticks fetch blood, means punishing pastime, men play purpose savagely body arms adversaries. The old gamester going action takes hat coat, arms stick; loops fingers left hand handkerchief strap, fastens round left leg, measuring length, draws tight left elbow air, elbow shall reach high crown. Thus see, long chooses keep left elbow up, regardless cuts, perfect guard left side head. Then advances right hand front head, holding stick across, point projects inch two left elbow; thus whole head completely guarded, faces man armed like manner; stand three feet apart, often nearer, feint, strike, return one another's heads, one cries “hold,” blood flows. In first case allowed minute's time; go again; latter another pair gamesters called on. If good men playing, quickness returns marvellous: hear rattle like boy makes drawing stick along palings, heavier; closeness men action one another gives strange interest, makes spell back-swording noble sight. They suited sticks, Joe Willis gipsy man drawn first lot. So rest lean rails stage, Joe dark man meet middle, boards strewed sawdust, Joe's white shirt spotless drab breeches boots contrasting gipsy's coarse blue shirt dirty green velveteen breeches leather gaiters. Joe evidently turning nose other, half insulted break head. The gipsy tough, active fellow, skilful weapon, Joe's weight strength tell minute; heavy metal him. Whack, whack, whack, come blows, breaking gipsy's guard, threatening reach head every moment. There last. “Blood, blood!” shout spectators, thin stream oozes slowly roots hair, umpire calls stop. The gipsy scowls Joe brows pleasant manner, Master Joe swaggers about, makes attitudes, thinks himself, shows thinks himself, greatest man field. Then follow several stout sets-to candidates new hat, last come shepherd Willum Smith. This crack set-to day. They famous wind, crying “hold.” The shepherd old hand, dodges. He tries one another, nearly gets Willum's head coming near, playing guard half-stick; somehow Willum blunders through, catching stick shoulders, neck, sides, every then, anywhere head, returns heavy straight, youngest gamester favourite parish, gallant stand brings shouts cheers, knowing ones think win keeps steady; Tom, groom's shoulder, holds hands together, hardly breathe excitement. Alas Willum! His sweetheart, getting tired female companionship, hunting booths see got to, catches sight stage full combat. She flushes turns pale; old aunt catches hold her, saying, “Bless 'ee, child, doan't 'ee go a'nigst it;” breaks away runs towards stage calling name. Willum keeps guard stoutly, glances moment towards voice. No guard it, Willum, without eye. The shepherd steps round strikes, point stick grazes Willum's forehead, fetching skin, blood flows, umpire cries, “Hold!” poor Willum's chance day. But takes well, puts old hat coat, goes scolded sweetheart, led away mischief. Tom hears say coaxingly, walks off,-- “Now doan't 'ee, Rachel! I would ha' done it, I wanted summut buy 'ee fairing wi', I vlush money twod feathers.” “Thee mind I tells 'ee,” rejoins Rachel saucily, “and doan't 'ee kep blethering fairings.” Tom resolves heart give Willum remainder two shillings back-swording. Joe Willis luck to-day. His next bout ends easy victory, shepherd tough job break second head; Joe shepherd meet, whole circle expect hope see get broken crown, shepherd slips first round falls rails, hurting old farmer let go on, much wishes try; impostor Joe (for certainly best man) struts swaggers stage conquering gamester, though five minutes' really trying play. Joe takes new hat hand, puts money it, then, thought strikes him, think victory quite acknowledged below, walks face stage, looks down, shaking money, chaffing, stake hat money another half-sovereign “agin gamester played already.” Cunning Joe! thus gets rid Willum shepherd, quite fresh again. No one seems like offer, umpire coming down, queer old hat, something like doctor divinity's shovel, chucked stage elderly, quiet man steps out, watching play, saying like cross stick wi' prodigalish young chap. The crowd cheer, begin chaff Joe, turns nose swaggers across sticks. “Imp'dent old wosbird!” says he; “I break bald head un truth.” The old boy bald, certainly, blood show fast enough touch him, Joe. He takes long-flapped coat, stands long-flapped waistcoat, Sir Roger de Coverley might worn new, picks stick, ready Master Joe, loses time, begins old game, whack, whack, whack, trying break old man's guard sheer strength. But do; catches every blow close basket, though rather stiff returns, minute walks Joe stage, clearly stanch old gamester. Joe comes in, making height, tries get old man's guard half-stick, takes smart blow ribs another elbow, nothing more. And loses wind begins puff, crowd laugh. “Cry 'hold,' Joe; thee'st met thy match!” Instead taking good advice getting wind, Joe loses temper, strikes old man's body. “Blood, blood!” shout crowd; “Joe's head's broke!” Who would thought it? How come? That body-blow left Joe's head unguarded moment; one turn wrist old gentleman picked neat little bit skin middle forehead; though believe it, hammers three blows despite shouts, convinced blood trickling eye. Poor Joe sadly crestfallen, fumbles pocket half-sovereign, old gamester it. “Keep thy money, man, gi's thy hand,” says he; shake hands. But old gamester gives new hat shepherd, and, soon after, half-sovereign Willum, thereout decorates sweetheart ribbons heart's content. “Who be?” “Wur cum from?” ask crowd. And soon flies old west-country champion, played tie Shaw Lifeguardsman “Vizes” twenty years before, broken Joe Willis's crown him. How country fair spinning out! I see I must skip wrestling; boys jumping sacks, rolling wheelbarrows blindfolded; donkey-race, fight arose thereout, marring otherwise peaceful “veast;” frightened scurrying away female feast-goers, descent Squire Brown, summoned wife one combatants stop it; would start till got top-boots. Tom carried away old Benjy, dog-tired surfeited pleasure, evening comes dancing begins booths; though Willum, Rachel new ribbons, many another good lad lass come away yet, good step out, enjoy it, get harm thereby, yet we, sober folk, stroll away churchyard, old yew-tree, get quiet dish tea parley gossips, steady ones village do, bed. That fair, true sketch, far goes, one larger village feasts Vale Berks, I little boy. They much altered worse, I told. I one twenty years, I statute fairs west-country towns, servants hired, greater abominations cannot found. What village feasts come to, I fear, many cases, may read pages “Yeast” (though I never saw one bad--thank God!). Do want know why? It because, I said before, gentlefolk farmers left joining taking interest them. They either subscribe prizes, go enjoy fun. Is good bad sign? I hardly know. Bad, sure enough, arises separation classes consequent twenty years buying cheap selling dear, accompanying overwork; sons daughters hearts London club-life, so-called “society,” instead old English home-duties; farmers' sons apeing fine gentlemen, farmers' daughters caring make bad foreign music good English cheeses. Good, perhaps, time old “veast” gone by; longer healthy, sound expression English country holiday-making; that, fact, we, nation, got beyond it, transition state, feeling soon likely find better substitute. Only I got say I quit text. Do let reformers sort think going really lay hold working boys young men England educational grapnel whatever, bona fide equivalent games old country “veast” it; something put place back-swording wrestling racing; something try muscles men's bodies, endurance hearts, make rejoice strength. In new-fangled comprehensive plans I see, left out; consequence is, great mechanics' institutes end intellectual priggism, Christian young men's societies religious Pharisaism. Well, well, must bide time. Life beer skittles; beer skittles, something better sort, must form good part every Englishman's education. If I could drive heads rising parliamentary lords, young swells “have ways made you,” saying is, you, frequent palaver houses West-end clubs, waiting always ready strap back poor dear old John, soon present used-up lot (your fathers uncles), sit great parliamentary-majorities' pack-saddle, make believe guiding red-tape bridle, tumble, lifted off! I think much yet--I wish I could--though go talking lecturing country crowded audiences, busy sorts philanthropic intellectualism, circulating libraries museums, Heaven knows besides, try make us think, newspaper reports, are, even we, working classes. But bless hearts, “are green,” though lots us sorts toady enough certainly, try make think so. I tell now: instead trumpeting fuss, old parliamentary-majority dodge again, go, (you plenty time it, give t'other line), quietly make three four friends--real friends--among us. You find little trouble getting right sort, birds come lightly lure; found may be. Take, say, two professions, lawyer, parson, doctor--which will; one trade; three four working classes--tailors, engineers, carpenters, engravers. There plenty choice. Let men ages, mind, ask homes; introduce wives sisters, get introduced theirs; give good dinners, talk really bottom hearts; box, run, row them, chance. Do honestly man man, time come ride old John, able something sit back, may feel mouth stronger bridle red-tape one. Ah, would! But got far right rut, I fear. Too much over-civilization, deceitfulness riches. It easier camel go eye needle. More's pity. I never came across two could value man wholly solely him--who thought verily indeed flesh blood John Jones attorney's clerk, Bill Smith costermonger, could act thought so. CHAPTER III--SUNDRY WARS AND ALLIANCES. Poor old Benjy! The “rheumatiz” much answer English country-sides, never played scurvier trick laying thee heels, thou wast yet green old age. The enemy, long carrying sort border warfare, trying strength Benjy's battlefield hands legs, now, mustering forces, began laying siege citadel, overrunning whole country. Benjy seized back loins; though made strong brave fight, soon clear enough could beaten poor old Benjy would give long. It much could now, help big stick frequent stops, hobble canal Master Tom, bait hook him, sit watch angling, telling quaint old country stories; Tom sport, detecting rat hundred yards along bank, would rush Toby turnspit terrier, faithful companion, bootless pursuit, might tumbled drowned twenty times Benjy could got near him. Cheery unmindful himself, Benjy was, loss locomotive power bothered greatly. He got new object old age, beginning think useful world. He feared much, too, lest Master Tom fall back hands Charity women. So tried everything could think get set up. He even went expedition dwelling one queer mortals, who--say will, reason will--do cure simple people diseases one kind another without aid physic, get reputation using charms, inspire dwellings great respect, say fear, amongst simple folk dwellers Vale White Horse. Where power, whatever else may be, descends upon shoulders man whose ways straight, becomes nuisance neighbourhood--a receiver stolen goods, giver love-potions, deceiver silly women--the avowed enemy law order, justices peace, head-boroughs, gamekeepers,--such man, fact, recently caught tripping, deservedly dealt Leeds justices, seducing girl come get back faithless lover, convicted bigamy since then. Sometimes, however, quite different stamp--men pretend nothing, difficulty persuaded exercise occult arts simplest cases. Of latter sort old Farmer Ives, called, “wise man” Benjy resorted (taking Tom usual), early spring year next feast described last chapter. Why called “farmer” I cannot say, unless owner cow, pig two, poultry, maintained acre land inclosed middle wild common, probably father squatted lords manors looked keenly rights now. Here lived one knew long, solitary man. It often rumoured turned cottage pulled down, somehow never came pass; pigs cow went grazing common, geese hissed passing children heels horse lord's steward, often rode covetous eye inclosure still unmolested. His dwelling miles village; Benjy, half ashamed errand, wholly unable walk there, exercise much ingenuity get means transporting Tom thither without exciting suspicion. However, one fine May morning managed borrow old blind pony friend publican, Tom persuaded Madam Brown give holiday spend old Benjy, lend Squire's light cart, stored bread cold meat bottle ale. And two high glee started behind old Dobbin, jogged along deep-rutted plashy roads, mended winter's wear, towards dwelling wizard. About noon passed gate opened large common, old Dobbin toiled slowly hill, Benjy pointed little deep dingle left, welled tiny stream. As crept hill tops birch-trees came sight, blue smoke curling delicate light boughs; little white thatched home inclosed ground Farmer Ives, lying cradled dingle, gay gorse common rising behind sides; front, traversing gentle slope, eye might travel miles miles rich vale. They left main road struck green track common marked lightly wheel horse-shoe, led dingle stopped rough gate Farmer Ives. Here found farmer, iron-gray old man, bushy eyebrow strong aquiline nose, busied one vocations. He horse cow doctor, tending sick beast sent cured. Benjy hailed old friend, returned greeting cordially enough, looking however hard moment Benjy Tom, see whether visit appeared first sight. It work difficulty danger Benjy reach ground, which, however, managed without mishap; devoted unharnessing Dobbin turning graze (“a run” one could say virtuous steed) common. This done, extricated cold provisions cart, entered farmer's wicket; he, shutting knife taking maggots cow's back sides, accompanied towards cottage. A big old lurcher got slowly door-stone, stretching first one hind leg other, taking Tom's caresses presence Toby, kept, however, respectful distance, equal indifference. “Us cum pay 'ee visit. I long minded do't old sake's sake, I vinds I dwon't get I would used to't. I plaguy bad wi' th' rheumatiz back.” Benjy paused, hopes drawing farmer subject ailments without direct application. “Ah, I see bean't quite lissom was,” replied farmer, grim smile, lifted latch door; “we bean't young was, nother us, wuss luck.” The farmer's cottage like better class peasantry general. A snug chimney corner two seats, small carpet hearth, old flint gun pair spurs fireplace, dresser shelves bright pewter plates crockeryware arranged, old walnut table, chairs settles, framed samplers, old print two, bookcase dozen volumes walls, rack flitches bacon, stores fastened ceiling, best part furniture. No sign occult art seen, unless bundles dried herbs hanging rack ingle row labelled phials one shelves betoken it. Tom played kittens occupied hearth, goat walked demurely open door--while host Benjy spread table dinner--and soon engaged conflict cold meat, much honour. The two old men's talk old comrades deeds, mute inglorious Miltons Vale, doings thirty years back, interest much, except spoke making canal; indeed began listen ears, learned, small wonder, dear wonderful canal always--was not, fact, old Benjy Farmer Ives, caused strange commotion small brain. After dinner Benjy called attention wart Tom knuckles hand, family doctor trying skill without success, begged farmer charm away. Farmer Ives looked it, muttered something another it, cut notches short stick, handed Benjy, giving instructions cutting certain days, cautioning Tom meddle wart fortnight. And strolled sat bench sun pipes, pigs came grunted sociably let Tom scratch them; farmer, seeing liked animals, stood held arms air, gave call, brought flock pigeons wheeling dashing birch-trees. They settled clusters farmer's arms shoulders, making love scrambling one another's backs get face; threw off, fluttered close by, lighted held arms. All creatures place clean fearless, quite unlike relations elsewhere; Tom begged taught make pigs cows poultry village tame, farmer gave one grim chuckles. It till ready go, old Dobbin harnessed, Benjy broached subject rheumatism again, detailing symptoms one one. Poor old boy! He hoped farmer could charm away easily could Tom's wart, ready equal faith put another notched stick pocket, cure ailments. The physician shook head, nevertheless produced bottle, handed Benjy, instructions use. “Not 't'll 'ee much good--leastways I afeard not,” shading eyes hand, looking cart. “There one thing I knows as'll cure old folks like I th' rheumatiz.” “Wot then, farmer?” inquired Benjy. “Churchyard mould,” said old iron-gray man, another chuckle. And said good-byes went ways home. Tom's wart gone fortnight, Benjy's rheumatism, laid heels more. And though Tom still spent many hour him, sat bench sunshine, chimney corner cold, soon seek elsewhere regular companions. Tom accustomed often accompany mother visits cottages, thereby made acquaintance many village boys age. There Job Rudkin, son widow Rudkin, bustling woman parish. How could ever stolid boy Job child must always remain mystery. The first time Tom went cottage mother, Job indoors; entered soon after, stood hands pockets, staring Tom. Widow Rudkin, would cross madam get young Hopeful--a breach good manners wholly incapable--began series pantomime signs, puzzled him; last, unable contain longer, burst with, “Job! Job! thy cap?” “What! bean't 'ee head, mother?” replied Job, slowly extricating one hand pocket, feeling article question; found head sure enough, left there, mother's horror Tom's great delight. Then poor Jacob Dodson, half-witted boy, ambled cheerfully, undertaking messages little helpful odds ends every one, which, however, poor Jacob managed always hopelessly imbrangle. Everything came pieces hands, nothing would stop head. They nicknamed Jacob Doodle-calf. But Harry Winburn, quickest best boy parish. He might year older Tom, little bigger, Crichton village boys. He could wrestle climb run better rest, learned schoolmaster could teach faster worthy liked. He boy proud of, curly brown hair, keen gray eye, straight active figure, little ears hands feet, “as fine lord's,” Charity remarked Tom one day, talking, usual, great nonsense. Lords' hands ears feet ugly folk's children, one may convince likes look. Tight boots gloves, nothing them, I allow make difference time twenty. Now Benjy laid shelf, young brothers still petticoat government, Tom, search companions, began cultivate village boys generally more. Squire Brown, said, true-blue Tory backbone, believed honestly powers ordained God, loyalty steadfast obedience men's first duties. Whether consequence spite political creed, I mean give opinion, though I one; certain held therewith divers social principles generally supposed true blue colour. Foremost these, one Squire loved propound others, belief man valued wholly solely himself, stands four fleshly walls him, apart clothes, rank, fortune, externals whatsoever. Which belief I take wholesome corrective political opinions, and, held sincerely, make opinions equally harmless, whether blue, red, green. As necessary corollary belief, Squire Brown held matter straw whether son associated lords' sons ploughmen's sons, provided brave honest. He played football gone bird-nesting farmers met vestry labourers tilled fields, father grandfather, progenitors. So encouraged Tom intimacy boys village, forwarded means power, gave run close playground, provided bats balls football sports. Our village blessed amongst things well-endowed school. The building stood itself, apart master's house, angle ground three roads met--an old gray stone building steep roof mullioned windows. On one opposite angles stood Squire Brown's stables kennel, backs road, towered great elm-tree; third stood village carpenter wheelwright's large open shop, house schoolmaster's, long low eaves, swallows built scores. The moment Tom's lessons over, would get corner stables, watch till boys came school. He prevailed groom cut notches bark elm could climb lower branches; would sit watching school door, speculating possibility turning elm dwelling-place friends, manner Swiss Family Robinson. But school hours long Tom's patience short, soon began descend street, go peep school door wheelwright's shop, look something away time. Now wheelwright choleric man, one fine afternoon, returning short absence, found Tom occupied one pet adzes, edge fast vanishing hero's care. A speedy flight saved Tom one sound cuff ears; resented unjustifiable interruption first essays carpentering, still proceedings wheelwright, cut switch, hung door workshop, threatening use upon Tom came within twenty yards gate. So Tom, retaliate, commenced war upon swallows dwelt wheelwright's eaves, harassed sticks stones; fleeter foot enemy, escaped punishment, kept perpetual anger. Moreover, presence school door began incense master, boys neighbourhood neglected lessons consequence; issued porch, rod hand, Tom beat hasty retreat. And wheelwright, laying heads together, resolved acquaint Squire Tom's afternoon occupations; order effect, determined take captive lead away judgment fresh evil doings. This would found difficulty doing, Tom continued war single-handed, rather single-footed, would taken deepest part Pebbly Brook escape them; but, like active powers, ruined alliances. Poor Jacob Doodle-calf could go school boys, one fine afternoon, three clock (the school broke four), Tom found ambling street, pressed visit school-porch. Jacob, always ready asked, consented, two stole school together. Tom first reconnoitred wheelwright's shop; seeing signs activity, thought safe quarter, ordered advance troops upon schoolporch. The door school ajar, boys seated nearest bench recognized opened correspondence invaders. Tom, waxing bold, kept putting head school making faces master back turned. Poor Jacob, least comprehending situation, high glee finding near school, never allowed enter, suddenly, fit enthusiasm, pushed Tom, ambling three steps school, stood there, looking round nodding self-approving smile. The master, stooping boy's slate, back door, became aware something unusual, turned quickly round. Tom rushed Jacob, began dragging back smock-frock, master made them, scattering forms boys career. Even might escaped, porch, barring retreat, appeared crafty wheelwright, watching proceedings. So seized, school dismissed, Tom Jacob led away Squire Brown lawful prize, boys following gate groups, speculating result. The Squire angry first, interview, Tom's pleading, ended compromise. Tom go near school till three clock, done lessons well, case bearer note master Squire Brown; master agreed case release ten twelve best boys hour time breaking up, go play close. The wheelwright's adzes swallows ever respected; hero master withdrew servants' hall drink Squire's health, well satisfied day's work. The second act Tom's life may said begun. The war independence time: none women now--not even mother's maid--dared offer help dressing washing. Between ourselves, often first run Benjy unfinished state toilet. Charity rest seemed take delight putting impossible buttons ties middle back; would gone without nether integuments altogether, sooner recourse female valeting. He room himself, father gave sixpence week pocket-money. All achieved Benjy's advice assistance. But conquered another step life--the step real boys long make: got amongst equals age strength, could measure boys; lived whose pursuits wishes ways kind own. The little governess lately installed house found work grow wondrously easy, Tom slaved lessons, order make sure note schoolmaster. So days week Tom village boys playing close three clock. Prisoner's base, rounders, high-cock-a-lorum, cricket, football--he soon initiated delights all; though boys older himself, managed hold well. He naturally active strong, quick eye hand, advantage light shoes well-fitting dress, short time could run jump climb them. They generally finished regular games half hour tea-time, began trials skill strength many ways. Some would catch Shetland pony turned field, get two three together back, little rogue, enjoying fun, would gallop fifty yards, turn round, stop short shoot turf, graze quietly till felt another load; others played peg-top marbles, bigger ones stood bout wrestling. Tom first looked pastime, peculiar attractions him, could long keep it. Elbow collar wrestling, practised western counties, was, next back-swording, way fame youth Vale; boys knew rules it, less expert. But Job Rudkin Harry Winburn stars--the former stiff sturdy, legs like small towers; latter pliant indiarubber quick lightning. Day day stood foot foot, offered first one hand other, grappled closed, swayed strained, till well-aimed crook heel thrust loin took effect, fair back-fall ended matter. And Tom watched eyes, first challenged one less scientific, threw him; one one wrestled way leaders. Then indeed months poor time it; long indeed could manage keep legs Job, hero slow offence, gained victories chiefly allowing others throw immovable legs loins. But Harry Winburn undeniably master; first clutch hands stood up, last trip sent back turf, felt Harry knew could he. Luckily Harry's bright unconsciousness Tom's natural good temper kept quarrelling; Tom worked on, trod nearly Harry's heels, last mastered dodges falls except one. This one Harry's particular invention pet; scarcely ever used except hard pressed, came, sure did, went poor Tom. He thought fall meals, walks, lay awake bed, dreams, purpose, Harry one day open way suggested thought met; week time boys equal, save slight difference strength Harry's favour, extra ten months age gave. Tom often afterwards reason thankful early drilling, all, mastered Harry Winburn's fall. Besides home games, Saturdays boys would wander neighbourhood; sometimes downs, camp, cut initials springy turf, watched hawks soaring, “peert” bird, Harry Winburn called gray plover, gorgeous wedding feathers; home, racing Manger many roll among thistles, Uffington Wood watch fox cubs playing green rides; sometimes Rosy Brook, cut long whispering reeds grew there, make pan-pipes of; sometimes Moor Mills, piece old forest land, short browsed turf tufted brambly thickets stretching oaks, amongst rumour declared raven, last race, still lingered; sand-hills, vain quest rabbits; bird-nesting season, anywhere everywhere. The neighbours Squire's rank every would shrug shoulders drove rode party boys Tom middle, carrying along bulrushes whispering reeds, great bundles cowslip meadow-sweet, young starlings magpies, spoil wood, brook, meadow; Lawyer Red-tape might mutter Squire Straight-back Board good would come young Browns, let run wild dirty village boys, best farmers' sons even would play with. And squire might reply shake head sons mixed equals, never went village without governess footman. But, luckily, Squire Brown full stiffbacked neighbours, went way; Tom younger brothers, grew up, went playing village boys, without idea equality inequality (except wrestling, running, climbing) ever entering heads; till put Jack Nastys fine ladies' maids. I mean say would case villages, certainly one: village boys full manly honest, certainly purer, higher rank; Tom got harm equals first fortnight private school, went nine years old, village friends day left Charity's apron-strings. Great grief amongst village school-boys Tom drove Squire, one August morning, meet coach way school. Each given little present best had, small private box full peg-taps, white marbles (called “alley-taws” Vale), screws, birds' eggs, whip-cord, jews-harps, miscellaneous boys' wealth. Poor Jacob Doodle-calf, floods tears, pressed upon spluttering earnestness lame pet hedgehog (he always poor broken-down beast bird him); Tom obliged refuse, Squire's order. He given great tea big elm playground, Madam Brown supplied biggest cake ever seen village; Tom really sorry leave lose him, sorrow unmixed pride excitement making new step life. And feeling carried first parting mother better could expected. Their love fair whole human love be--perfect self-sacrifice one side meeting young true heart other. It within scope book, however, speak family relations, I much say subject English mothers--ay, English fathers, sisters, brothers too. Neither I room speak private schools. What I say public schools--those much-abused much-belauded institutions peculiar England. So must hurry Master Tom's year private school fast can. It fair average specimen, kept gentleman, another gentleman second master; little enough real work did--merely coming school lessons prepared ready heard. The whole discipline school lesson hours hands two ushers, one always boys playground, school, meals--in fact, times every where, till fairly bed night. Now theory private schools (or was) constant supervision school--therein differing fundamentally public schools. It may right wrong; right, supervision surely ought especial work head-master, responsible person. The object schools ram Latin Greek boys, make good English boys, good future citizens; far important part work must done, done, school hours. To leave it, therefore, hands inferior men, giving highest hardest part work education. Were I private school-master, I say, Let hear boys lessons, let live play rest. The two ushers Tom's first school gentlemen, poorly educated, driving poor trade usher get living could it. They bad men, little heart work, course bent making easy possible. One methods endeavoured accomplish encouraging tale-bearing, become frightfully common vice school consequence, sapped foundations school morality. Another was, favouring grossly biggest boys, alone could given much trouble; whereby young gentlemen became abominable tyrants, oppressing little boys small mean ways prevail private schools. Poor little Tom made dreadfully unhappy first week catastrophe happened first letter home. With huge labour had, evening arrival, managed fill two sides sheet letter-paper assurances love dear mamma, happiness school, resolves would wish. This missive, help boy sat desk next him, also new arrival, managed fold successfully; done, sadly put means sealing. Envelopes unknown; wax, dared disturb stillness evening school-room getting going ask usher some. At length Tom's friend, ingenious turn mind, suggested sealing ink; letter accordingly stuck blob ink, duly handed Tom, way bed, housekeeper posted. It till four days afterwards good dame sent him, produced precious letter wax, saying, “O Master Brown, I forgot tell before, letter sealed.” Poor Tom took wax silence sealed letter, huge lump rising throat process, ran away quiet corner playground, burst agony tears. The idea mother waiting day day letter promised once, perhaps thinking forgetful her, done power make good promise, bitter grief undergo many long year. His wrath, then, proportionately violent aware two boys, stopped close him, one whom, fat gaby fellow, pointed called “Young mammy-sick!” Whereupon Tom arose, giving vent thus grief shame rage, smote derider nose; made bleed; sent young worthy howling usher, reported Tom violent unprovoked assault battery. Hitting face felony punishable flogging, hitting misdemeanour--a distinction altogether clear principle. Tom, however, escaped penalty pleading primum tempus; written second letter mother, inclosing forget-me-nots, picked first half-holiday walk, felt quite happy again, began enjoy vastly good deal new life. These half-holiday walks great events week. The whole fifty boys started dinner one ushers Hazeldown, distant mile school. Hazeldown measured three miles round, neighbourhood several woods full manner birds butterflies. The usher walked slowly round boys liked accompany him; rest scattered directions, bound appear usher completed round, accompany home. They forbidden, however, go anywhere except woods; village especially prohibited, huge bull's-eyes unctuous toffy might procured exchange coin realm. Various amusements boys betook themselves. At entrance steep hillock, like barrows Tom's downs. This mound weekly scene terrific combats, game called queer name “mud-patties.” The boys played divided sides different leaders, one side occupied mound. Then, parties provided many sods turf, cut bread-and-cheese knives, side remained bottom proceeded assault mound, advancing sides cover heavy fire turfs, struggling victory occupants, soon could, even moment, clear summit, turn became besieged. It good, rough, dirty game, great use counteracting sneaking tendencies school. Then others boys spread downs, looking holes humble-bees mice, dug without mercy, often (I regret say) killing skinning unlucky mice, (I regret say) getting well stung bumble-bees. Others went butterflies birds' eggs seasons; Tom found Hazeldown, first time, beautiful little blue butterfly golden spots wings, never seen downs, dug first sand-martin's nest. This latter achievement resulted flogging, sand-martins built high bank close village, consequently bounds; one bolder spirits school, never could happy unless something risk attached, easily persuaded Tom break bounds visit martins' bank. From whence step toffy shop, could simple go fill pockets; certain return, distribution treasure made, usher shortly detect forbidden smell bull's-eyes, and, search ensuing, discover state breeches-pockets Tom ally? This ally Tom's indeed desperate hero sight boys, feared one dealt magic, something approaching thereto. Which reputation came wise. The boys went bed eight, and, course, consequently lay awake dark hour two, telling ghost-stories turns. One night came turn, dried souls story, suddenly declared would make fiery hand appear door; astonishment terror boys room, hand, something like it, pale light, appear. The fame exploit spread rooms, discredited there, young necromancer declared wonder would appear rooms turn, accordingly did; whole circumstances privately reported one ushers usual, functionary, listening doors rooms, sudden descent caught performer night-shirt, box phosphorus guilty hand. Lucifer-matches present facilities getting acquainted fire unknown--the name phosphorus something diabolic boy-mind; Tom's ally, cost sound flogging, earned many older folk covet much--the decided fear companions. He remarkable boy, means bad one. Tom stuck till left, got many scrapes doing. But great opponent tale-bearing habits school, open enemy ushers; worthy support. Tom imbibed fair amount Latin Greek school, somehow, whole, suit him, it, holidays constantly working Squire send public school. Great joy then, middle third half-year, October 183-, fever broke village, master slightly sickened it, whole boys sent day's notice respective homes. The Squire quite pleased Master Tom see young gentleman's brown, merry face appear home, two months proper time, Christmas holidays; so, putting thinking cap, retired study wrote several letters, result that, one morning breakfast-table, fortnight Tom's return, addressed wife with--“My dear, I arranged Tom shall go Rugby once, last six weeks half-year, instead wasting riding loitering home. It kind doctor allow it. Will see things ready Friday, I shall take town, send next day himself.” Mrs. Brown prepared announcement, merely suggested doubt whether Tom yet old enough travel himself. However, finding father son point, gave in, like wise woman, proceeded prepare Tom's kit launch public school. CHAPTER IV--THE STAGE COACH. “Let steam-pot hiss till hot; Give speed Tantivy trot.” Coaching Song, R.E.E. Warburton, Esq. “Now, sir, time get up, please. Tally-ho coach Leicester'll round half hour, wait nobody.” So spake boots Peacock Inn Islington, half-past two clock morning day early part November 183-, giving Tom time shake shoulder, putting candle; carrying shoes clean. Tom father arrived town Berkshire day before, finding, inquiry, Birmingham coaches ran city pass Rugby, deposited passengers Dunchurch, village three miles distant main road, said passengers wait Oxford Leicester coach evening, take post-chaise, resolved Tom travel Tally-ho, diverged main road passed Rugby itself. And Tally-ho early coach, driven Peacock road. Tom never London, would liked stopped Belle Savage, put Star, dusk, might gone roving endless, mysterious, gas-lit streets, which, glare hum moving crowds, excited could talk even. But soon found Peacock arrangement would get Rugby twelve clock day, whereas otherwise would till evening, plans melted away, one absorbing aim become public school-boy fast possible, six hours sooner later seeming alarming importance. Tom father alighted Peacock seven evening; heard unfeigned joy paternal order, bar, steaks oyster-sauce supper half hour, seen father seated cozily bright fire coffee-room paper hand, Tom run see him, wondered vehicles passing repassing, fraternized boots hostler, ascertained Tally-ho tip-top goer--ten miles hour including stoppages--and punctual road set clocks her. Then summoned supper, regaled one bright little boxes Peacock coffee-room, beef-steak unlimited oyster-sauce brown stout (tasted first time--a day marked ever Tom white stone); first attended excellent advice father bestowing glass steaming brandy-and-water, began nodding, united effects stout, fire, lecture; till Squire, observing Tom's state, remembering nearly nine clock, Tally-ho left three, sent little fellow chambermaid, shake hand (Tom stipulated morning starting kissing cease them), parting words: “And now, Tom, boy,” said Squire, “remember going, earnest request, chucked great school, like young bear, troubles you--earlier sent perhaps. If schools time, see great many cruel blackguard things done, hear deal foul, bad talk. But never fear. You tell truth, keep brave kind heart, never listen say anything would mother sister hear, never feel ashamed come home, see you.” The allusion mother made Tom feel rather choky, would liked hugged father well, recent stipulation. As was, squeezed father's hand, looked bravely said, “I try, father.” “I know will, boy. Is money safe? “Yes,” said Tom, diving one pocket make sure. “And keys?” said Squire. “All right,” said Tom, diving pocket. “Well, then, good-night. God bless you! I tell boots call you, see off.” Tom carried chambermaid brown study, roused clean little attic, buxom person calling little darling kissing left room; indignity much surprised resent. And still thinking father's last words, look spoken, knelt prayed that, come might, might never bring shame sorrow dear folk home. Indeed, Squire's last words deserved effect, result much anxious thought. All way London pondered say Tom way parting advice--something boy could keep head ready use. By way assisting meditation, even gone length taking flint steel tinder, hammering away quarter hour till manufactured light long Trichinopoli cheroot, silently puffed, small wonder coachee, old friend, institution Bath road, always expected talk prospects doings, agricultural social, whole country, carried Squire. To condense Squire's meditation, somewhat follows: “I tell read Bible, love serve God; mother's sake teaching, mine. Shall I go sort temptations meet with? No, I cannot that. Never old fellow go things boy. He understand me. Do harm good, ten one. Shall I tell mind work, say sent school make good scholar? Well, sent school that--at rate, mainly. I care straw Greek particles, digamma; mother. What sent school for? Well, partly wanted go. If turn brave, helpful, truth-telling Englishman, gentleman, Christian, I want,” thought Squire; upon view case framed last words advice Tom, well enough suited purpose. For Tom's first thoughts tumbled bed summons boots, proceeded rapidly wash dress himself. At ten minutes three coffee-room stockings, carrying hat-box, coat, comforter hand; found father nursing bright fire, cup hot coffee hard biscuit table. “Now, then, Tom, give us things here, drink this. There nothing like starting warm, old fellow.” Tom addressed coffee, prattled away worked shoes greatcoat, well warmed through--a Petersham coat velvet collar, made tight abominable fashion days. And swallowing last mouthful, winding comforter round throat, tucking ends breast coat, horn sounds; boots looks says, “Tally-ho, sir;” hear ring rattle four fast trotters town-made drag, dashes Peacock. “Anything us, Bob?” says burly guard, dropping behind, slapping across chest. “Young gen'lm'n, Rugby; three parcels, Leicester; hamper game, Rugby,” answers hostler. “Tell young gent look alive,” says guard, opening hind-boot shooting parcels examining lamps. “Here; shove portmanteau a-top. I fasten presently.--Now then, sir, jump behind.” “Good-bye, father--my love home.” A last shake hand. Up goes Tom, guard catching hatbox holding one hand, claps horn mouth. Toot, toot, toot! hostlers let go heads, four bays plunge collar, away goes Tally-ho darkness, forty-five seconds time pulled up. Hostler, boots, Squire stand looking Peacock lamp. “Sharp work!” says Squire, goes bed, coach well sight hearing. Tom stands coach looks back father's figure long see it; guard, disposed luggage, comes anchor, finishes buttonings preparations facing three hours dawn--no joke minded cold, fast coach November, reign late Majesty. I sometimes think boys generation deal tenderer fellows used be. At rate much comfortable travellers, I see every one rug plaid, dodges preserving caloric, going in, fuzzy, dusty, padded first-class carriages. It another affair altogether, dark ride top Tally-ho, I tell you, tight Petersham coat, feet dangling six inches floor. Then knew cold was, without legs, bit feeling first half-hour. But pleasures, old dark ride. First consciousness silent endurance, dear every Englishman--of standing something, giving in. Then music rattling harness, ring horses' feet hard road, glare two bright lamps steaming hoar frost, leaders' ears, darkness, cheery toot guard's horn, warn drowsy pikeman hostler next change; looking forward daylight; last, least, delight returning sensation toes. Then break dawn sunrise, ever seen perfection coach roof? You want motion change music see glory--not music singing men singing women, good, silent music, sets head, accompaniment work getting ground. The Tally-ho past St. Albans, Tom enjoying ride, though half-frozen. The guard, alone back coach, silent, muffled Tom's feet straw, put end oat-sack knees. The darkness driven inwards, gone little past life, thought doings promises, mother sister, father's last words; made fifty good resolutions, means bear like brave Brown is, though young one. Then forward mysterious boy-future, speculating sort place Rugby is, there, calling stories public schools heard big boys holidays. He choke-full hope life, notwithstanding cold, kicks heels back-board, would like sing, know friend silent guard might take it. And dawn breaks end fourth stage, coach pulls little roadside inn huge stables behind. There bright fire gleaming red curtains bar window, door open. The coachman catches whip double thong, throws hostler; steam horses rises straight air. He put along last two miles, two minutes time. He rolls box inn. The guard rolls behind. “Now, sir,” says Tom, “you jump down, I give drop something keep cold out.” Tom finds difficulty jumping, indeed finding top wheel feet, may next world feels; guard picks coach top, sets legs, stump bar, join coachman outside passengers. Here fresh-looking barmaid serves glass early purl stand fire, coachman guard exchanging business remarks. The purl warms cockles Tom's heart, makes cough. “Rare tackle that, sir, cold morning,” says coachman, smiling. “Time's up.” They up; coachee last, gathering reins hands talking Jem hostler mare's shoulder, swinging box--the horses dashing canter falls seat. Toot-toot-tootle-too goes horn, away again, five-and-thirty miles road (nearly half-way Rugby, thinks Tom), prospect breakfast end stage. And begin see, early life country-side comes out--a market cart two; men smock-frocks going work, pipe mouth, whiff bad smell bright morning. The sun gets up, mist shines like silver gauze. They pass hounds jogging along distant meet, heels huntsman's back, whose face colour tails old pink, exchanges greetings coachman guard. Now pull lodge, take board well-muffled-up sportsman, gun-case carpet-bag, An early up-coach meets them, coachmen gather horses, pass one another accustomed lift elbow, team eleven miles hour, mile spare behind necessary. And comes breakfast. “Twenty minutes here, gentlemen,” says coachman, pull half-past seven inn-door. Have endured nobly morning? worthy reward much endurance? There low, dark wainscoted room hung sporting prints; hat-stand (with whip two standing belonging bagmen still snug bed) door; blazing fire, quaint old glass mantelpiece, stuck large card list meets week county hounds; table covered whitest cloths china, bearing pigeon-pie, ham, round cold boiled beef cut mammoth ox, great loaf household bread wooden trencher. And comes stout head waiter, puffing tray hot viands--kidneys steak, transparent rashers poached eggs, buttered toast muffins, coffee tea, smoking hot. The table never hold all. The cold meats removed sideboard--they put show give us appetite. And fall on, gentlemen all. It well-known sporting-house, breakfasts famous. Two three men pink, way meet, drop in, jovial sharp-set, indeed are. “Tea coffee, sir?” says head waiter, coming round Tom. “Coffee, please,” says Tom, mouth full muffin kidney. Coffee treat him, tea not. Our coachman, I perceive, breakfasts us, cold beef man. He also eschews hot potations, addicts tankard ale, brought barmaid. Sportsman looks approvingly, orders ditto himself. Tom eaten kidney pigeon-pie, imbibed coffee, till little skin tight drum; pleasure paying head waiter purse, dignified manner, walks inn-door see horses put to. This done leisurely highly-finished manner hostlers, enjoyed hurried. Coachman comes waybill, puffing fat cigar sportsman given him. Guard emerges tap, prefers breakfasting, licking round tough-looking doubtful cheroot, might tie round finger, three whiffs would knock one else time. The pinks stand inn-door lighting cigars waiting see us start, hacks led market-place, inn looks. They know sportsman, feel reflected credit see chatting laughing them. “Now, sir, please,” says coachman. All rest passengers up; guard locking hind-boot. “A good run you!” says sportsman pinks, coachman's side time. “Let go, Dick!” The hostlers fly back, drawing cloths glossy loins, away go market-place High Street, looking first-floor windows, seeing several worthy burgesses shaving thereat; shopboys cleaning windows, housemaids steps, stop look pleased rattle past, part legitimate morning's amusement. We clear town, well hedgerows town clock strikes eight. The sun shines almost warmly, breakfast oiled springs loosened tongues. Tom encouraged remark two guard's puffs oily cheroot, besides getting tired talking. He full destination talk anything else, asks guard knows Rugby. “Goes every day life. Twenty minutes afore twelve down--ten clock up.” “What sort place it, please?” says Tom. Guard looks comical expression. “Werry out-of-the-way place, sir; paving streets, lighting. 'Mazin' big horse cattle fair autumn--lasts week--just now. Takes town week get clean it. Fairish hunting country. But slow place, sir, slow place--off main road, see--only three coaches day, one two-oss wan, like hearse coach--Regulator--comes Oxford. Young genl'm'n school calls Pig Whistle, goes college (six miles hour) goes enter. Belong school, sir?” “Yes,” says Tom, unwilling moment guard think old boy. But then, qualms truth assertion, seeing assume character old boy could go asking questions wanted, added--“That say, I way there. I new boy.” The guard looked knew quite well Tom. “You werry late, sir,” says guard; “only six weeks to-day end half.” Tom assented. “We takes fine loads day six weeks, Monday Tuesday arter. Hopes shall pleasure carrying back.” Tom said hoped would; thought within fate would probably Pig Whistle. “It pays uncommon cert'nly,” continues guard. “Werry free cash young genl'm'n. But, Lor' bless you, gets rows 'long road, wi' pea-shooters, long whips, hollering, upsetting every one comes by, I would sight sooner carry one two them, sir, I may a-carryin' now, coach-load.” “What pea-shooters?” inquires Tom. “Do wi' them! Why, peppers every one's faces comes near, 'cept young gals, breaks windows wi' too, shoots hard. Now last June, a-driving first-day boys, mendin' quarter-mile road, lot Irish chaps, reg'lar roughs, a-breaking stones. As comes up, 'Now, boys,' says young gent box (smart young fellow desper't reckless), 'here fun! Let Pats ears.' 'God's sake sir!' says Bob (that mate coachman); 'do go shoot them. They knock us coach.' 'Damme, coachee,' says young lord, 'you afraid.--Hoora, boys! let it.' 'Hoora!' sings others, fill mouths choke-full peas last whole line. Bob, seeing come, knocks hat eyes, hollers osses, shakes up; away goes line them, twenty miles hour. The Pats begin hoora too, thinking runaway; first lot stands grinnin' wavin' old hats comes abreast them; would ha' laughed see took aback choking savage looked, gets peas a-stinging them. But bless you, laugh side, sir, long way. We going fast, took aback, take till half-way line. Then was, 'Look all!' surely. They howls line fit frighten you; runs arter us tries clamber behind, hits fingers pulls hands off; one sharp act'ly runs right leaders, though would ketch heads, luck'ly misses tip comes heap stones first. The rest picks stones, gives us right away till gets shot, young gents holding werry manful pea-shooters stones lodged us, pretty many too. Then Bob picks hisself again, looks young gent box werry solemn. Bob'd rum un ribs, which'd like ha' knocked box, made drop reins. Young gent box picks hisself up, all, looks round count damage. Box's head cut open hat gone; 'nother young gent's hat gone; mine knocked side, one us black blue somewheres another, over. Two pound ten pay damage paint, subscribed then, give Bob extra half-sovereign each; I would go line twenty half-sovereigns.” And guard shook head slowly, got blew clear, brisk toot-toot. “What fun!” said Tom, could scarcely contain pride exploit future school-fellows. He longed already end half, might join them. “'Taint good fun, though, sir, folk meets coach, go back next day. Them Irishers last summer got stones ready us, letting drive, would got two reverend gents aboard too. We pulled beginning line, pacified them, never going carry pea-shooters, unless promises fire line Irish chaps a-stonebreaking.” The guard stopped pulled away cheroot, regarding Tom benignantly while. “Oh, stop! Tell us something pea-shooting.” “Well, would like pretty piece work Bicester, back. We six mile town, meets old square-headed gray-haired yeoman chap, a-jogging along quite quiet. He looks coach, pea hits nose, catches cob behind makes dance hind legs. I see'd old boy's face flush look plaguy awkward, I thought something nasty. “He turns cob's head rides quietly us shot. How 'ere cob step! We never shook dozen yards six miles. At first young gents werry lively him; afore got in, seeing steady old chap come on, quite quiet, laid heads together do. Some fighting, axing pardon. He rides town close us, comes stops, says two shot must come magistrate; great crowd comes round, could get osses to. But young uns stand one another, says none must go, would fight out, carried. Just gettin' serious, old boy mob going pull coach, one little fellow jumps says, 'Here--I stay. I going three miles farther. My father's name's Davis; known here, I go magistrate gentleman.' 'What! thee parson Davis's son?' says old boy. 'Yes,' says young un. 'Well, I mortal sorry meet thee company; thy father's sake thine (for thee bist brave young chap) I say it.' Did boys cheer him, mob cheered young chap; one biggest gets down, begs pardon werry gentlemanly rest, saying plaguy vexed first, like ax pardon till then, felt ought shirk consequences joke. And got down, shook hands old boy, asked parts country, homes; drives twenty minutes behind time, cheering hollering county 'members. But, Lor' bless you, sir,” says guard, smacking hand knee looking full Tom's face, “ten minutes arter bad ever.” Tom showed undisguised open-mouthed interest narrations old guard rubbed memory, launched graphic history performances boys roads last twenty years. Off road could go; exploit must connected horses vehicles hang old fellow's head. Tom tried ground twice, found knew nothing beyond, let head, rest road bowled easily away; old Blow-hard (as boys called him) dry old file, much kindness humour, capital spinner yarn broken neck day's work, got plenty ale belt. What struck Tom's youthful imagination desperate lawless character stories. Was guard hoaxing him? He could help hoping true. It odd almost English boys love danger. You get ten join game, climb tree, swim stream, chance breaking limbs getting drowned, one stay level ground, depth, play quoits bowls. The guard finished account desperate fight happened one fairs drovers farmers whips, boys cricket-bats wickets, arose playful objectionable practice boys going round public-houses taking linch-pins wheels gigs, moralizing upon way Doctor, “a terrible stern man would heard tell,” come upon several performers, “sending three next morning po-shay parish constable,” turned corner neared milestone, third Rugby. By stone two boys stood, jackets buttoned tight, waiting coach. “Look here, sir,” says guard, giving sharp toot-toot; “there two them; out-and-out runners be. They comes twice three times week, spirts mile alongside us.” And came up, sure enough, away went two boys along footpath, keeping horses--the first light, clean-made fellow going springs; stout round-shouldered, labouring pace, going dogged bull-terrier. Old Blow-hard looked admiringly. “See beautiful un holds hisself together, goes hips, sir,” said he; “he 'mazin' fine runner. Now many coachmen drives first-rate team'd put on, try pass them. But Bob, sir, bless you, tender-hearted; would sooner pull bit see'd a-gettin' beat. I b'lieve, too, un'd sooner break heart let us go afore next milestone.” At second milestone boys pulled short, waved hats guard, watch shouted “4.56,” thereby indicating mile done four seconds five minutes. They passed several parties boys, objects deepest interest Tom, came sight town ten minutes twelve. Tom fetched long breath, thought never spent pleasanter day. Before went bed quite settled must greatest day ever spend, alter opinion many long year--if yet. CHAPTER V--RUGBY AND FOOTBALL. “Foot eye opposed In dubious strife.”--Scott. “And Rugby, sir, last, plenty time dinner School-house, I telled you,” said old guard, pulling horn case tootle-tooing away, coachman shook horses, carried along side school close, round Dead-man's corner, past school-gates, High Street Spread Eagle, wheelers spanking trot, leaders cantering, style would disgraced “Cherry Bob,” “ramping, stamping, tearing, swearing Billy Harwood,” old coaching heroes. Tom's heart beat quick passed great schoolfield close, noble elms, several games football going on, tried take long line gray buildings, beginning chapel, ending School-house, residence head-master, great flag lazily waving highest round tower. And began already proud Rugby boy, passed schoolgates, oriel window above, saw boys standing there, looking town belonged them, nodding familiar manner coachman, one would quite equal getting box, working team street well he. One young heroes, however, ran rest, scrambled behind; where, righted himself, nodded guard, “How do, Jem?” turned short round Tom, looking minute, began,-- “I say, fellow, name Brown?” “Yes,” said Tom, considerable astonishment, glad, however, lighted one already seemed know him. “Ah, I thought so. You know old aunt, Miss East. She lives somewhere way Berkshire. She wrote coming to-day, asked give lift.” Tom somewhat inclined resent patronizing air new friend, boy height age, gifted transcendent coolness assurance, Tom felt aggravating hard bear, could life help admiring envying--especially young lord begins hectoring two three long loafing fellows, half porter, half stableman, strong touch blackguard, end arranges one them, nicknamed Cooey, carry Tom's luggage School-house sixpence. “And hark 'ee, Cooey; must ten minutes, jobs me. Come along, Brown.” And away swaggers young potentate, hands pockets, Tom side. “All right, sir,” says Cooey, touching hat, leer wink companions. “Hullo though,” says East, pulling up, taking another look Tom; “this never do. Have got hat? We never wear caps here. Only louts wear caps. Bless you, go quadrangle thing on, I know happen.” The idea quite beyond young Master East, looked unutterable things. Tom thought cap knowing affair, confessed hat hat-box; accordingly extracted hind-boot, Tom equipped go-to-meeting roof, new friend called it. But quite suit fastidious taste another minute, shiny; so, walk town, dive Nixon's hatter's, Tom arrayed, utter astonishment, without paying it, regulation cat-skin seven-and-sixpence, Nixon undertaking send best hat matron's room, School-house, half hour. “You send note tile Monday, make right, know,” said Mentor; “we allowed two seven-and-sixers half, besides bring home.” Tom time began conscious new social position dignities, luxuriate realized ambition public school-boy last, vested right spoiling two seven-and-sixers half year. “You see,” said friend, strolled towards school-gates, explanation conduct, “a great deal depends fellow cuts first. If got nothing odd him, answers straightforward, holds head up, gets on. Now, well rig, cap. You see I handsome thing you, father knows yours; besides, I want please old lady. She gave half sov. half, perhaps'll double next, I keep good books.” There nothing candour like lower-school boy, East genuine specimen--frank, hearty, good-natured, well-satisfied position, choke-full life spirits, Rugby prejudices traditions able get together long course one half-year School-house. And Tom, notwithstanding bumptiousness, felt friends once, began sucking ways prejudices, fast could understand them. East great character cicerone. He carried Tom great gates, two three boys. These satisfied stock questions, “You fellow, name? Where come from? How old you? Where board?” and, “What form in?” And passed quadrangle small courtyard, upon looked lot little windows (belonging, guide informed him, School-house studies), matron's room, East introduced Tom dignitary; made give key trunk, matron might unpack linen, told story hat presence mind: upon relation whereof matron laughingly scolded coolest new boy house; East, indignant accusation newness, marched Tom quadrangle, began showing schools, examining literary attainments; result prophecy would form, could lessons together. “And come see study--we shall time dinner; afterwards, calling over, close.” Tom followed guide School-house hall, opens quadrangle. It great room, thirty feet long eighteen high, thereabouts, two great tables running whole length, two large fireplaces side, blazing fires them, one dozen boys standing lounging, shouted East stop; shot convoy, landed long, dark passages, large fire end each, upon studies opened. Into one these, bottom passage, East bolted hero, slamming bolting door behind them, case pursuit hall, Tom first time Rugby boy's citadel. He prepared separate studies, little astonished delighted palace question. It large, certainly, six feet long four broad. It could called light, bars grating window; little precautions necessary studies ground-floor looking close, prevent exit small boys locking up, entrance contraband articles. But uncommonly comfortable look at, Tom thought. The space window farther end occupied square table covered reasonably clean whole red blue check tablecloth; hard-seated sofa covered red stuff occupied one side, running end, making seat one, sitting close, two, table good stout wooden chair afforded seat another boy, three could sit work together. The walls wainscoted half-way up, wainscot covered green baize, remainder bright-patterned paper, hung three four prints dogs' heads; Grimaldi winning Aylesbury steeple-chase; Amy Robsart, reigning Waverley beauty day; Tom Crib, posture defence, credit science hero, truly represented. Over door row hat-pegs, side bookcases cupboards bottom, shelves cupboards filled indiscriminately school-books, cup two, mouse-trap candlesticks, leather straps, fustian bag, curious-looking articles puzzled Tom little, friend explained climbing-irons, showed use. A cricket-bat small fishing-rod stood one corner. This residence East another boy form, interest Tom Windsor Castle, residence British Isles. For become joint owner similar home, first place could call own? One's own! What charm words! How long takes boy man find worth! How fast us hold them--faster jealously, nearer general home take nothing, must go naked came world! When shall learn multiplieth possessions multiplieth troubles, one single use things call may hath need them? “And shall I study like too?” said Tom. “Yes, course; chummed fellow Monday, sit till then.” “What nice places!” “They well enough,” answered East, patronizingly, “only uncommon cold nights sometimes. Gower--that chum--and I make fire paper floor supper generally, makes smoky.” “But big fire passage,” said Tom. “Precious little get that, though,” said East. “Jones praepostor study fire end, rigged iron rod green baize curtain across passage, draws night, sits door open; gets fire, hears come studies eight, make noise. However, taken sitting fifth-form room lately, get bit fire sometimes; keep sharp lookout catch behind curtain comes down--that all.” A quarter past one struck, bell began tolling dinner; went hall took places, Tom bottom second table, next praepostor (who sat end keep order there), East paces higher. And Tom first time saw future school-fellows body. In came, hot ruddy football long walks, pale chilly hard reading studies, loitering fire pastrycook's, dainty mortals, bringing pickles saucebottles help dinners. And great big-bearded man, Tom took master, began calling names, great joints rapidly carved third table corner old verger housekeeper. Tom's turn came last, meanwhile eyes, looking first awe great man, sat close him, helped first, read hard-looking book time eating; got walked fire, small boys round him, reading, rest talking whispers one another, stealing one another's bread, shooting pellets, digging forks tablecloth. However, notwithstanding curiosity, managed make capital dinner time big man called “Stand up!” said grace. As soon dinner over, Tom questioned neighbours curious birth, parentage, education, like matters, East, evidently enjoyed new dignity patron mentor, proposed look close, Tom, athirst knowledge, gladly assented to; went quadrangle past big fives court, great playground. “That chapel, see,” said East; “and there, behind it, place fights. You see way masters, live side, come first lesson callings-over. That fights come off. And part little-side ground, right trees; side trees big-side ground, great matches played. And island farthest corner; know well enough next half, island fagging. I say, horrid cold; let us run across.” And away went East, Tom close behind him. East evidently putting best foot foremost; Tom, mighty proud running, little anxious show friend that, although new boy, milksop, laid work best style. Right across close went, knew, yard pulled island moat. “I say,” said East, soon got wind, looking much increased respect Tom, “you bad scud, means. Well, I warm toast now.” “But wear white trousers November?” said Tom. He struck peculiarity costume almost School-house boys. “Why, bless us, know? No; I forgot. Why, to-day's School-house match. Our house plays whole School football. And wear white trousers, show care hacks. You luck come to-day. You see match; Brooke's going let play quarters. That lower-school boy, except James, fourteen.” “Who Brooke?” “Why, big fellow called dinner, sure. He cock school, head School-house side, best kick charger Rugby.” “Oh, show play. And tell it. I love football so, played life. Will Brooke let play?” “Not he,” said East, indignation. “Why, know rules; month learning them. And joke playing-up match, I tell you--quite another thing private school games. Why, two collar-bones broken half, dozen fellows lamed. And last year fellow leg broken.” Tom listened profoundest respect chapter accidents, followed East across level ground till came sort gigantic gallows two poles, eighteen feet high, fixed upright ground fourteen feet apart, cross-bar running one height ten feet thereabouts. “This one goals,” said East, “and see other, across there, right opposite, Doctor's wall. Well, match best three goals; whichever side kicks two goals wins: do, see, kick ball posts--it must go cross-bar; height'll do, long posts. You stay goal touch ball rolls behind posts, side touch try goal. Then fellows quarters, play front goal here, turn ball kick back big fellows side follow up. And front us big fellows play, scrummages mostly.” Tom's respect increased struggled make friend's technicalities, set work explain mysteries “off side,” “drop-kicks,” “punts,” “places,” intricacies great science football. “But keep ball goals?” said he; “I cannot see might go right chapel.” “Why; play,” answered East. “You see gravel-walk running along side playing-ground, line elms opposite other? Well, bounds. As soon ball gets past them, touch, play. And whoever first touches knock straight amongst players-up, make two lines space them, every fellow going side. Are fine scrummages then! And three trees see come play, tremendous place ball hangs there, get thrown trees, worse hack.” Tom wondered within himself, strolled back towards fives court, whether matches really break-neck affairs East represented, whether, were, ever get like play well. He long wonder, however, next minute East cried out, “Hurrah! punt-about; come along try hand kick.” The punt-about practice-ball, brought kicked anyhow one boy another callings-over dinner, odd times. They joined boys brought out, small School-house fellows, friends East; Tom pleasure trying skill, performed creditably, first driving foot three inches ground, nearly kicking leg air, vigorous efforts accomplish drop-kick manner East. Presently boys bigger came out, boys houses way calling-over, balls sent for. The crowd thickened three clock approached; hour struck, one hundred fifty boys hard work. Then balls held, master week came cap gown calling-over, whole school three hundred boys swept big school answer names. “I may come in, may I?” said Tom, catching East arm, longing feel one them. “Yes, come along; nobody'll say anything. You eager get calling-over month,” replied friend; marched big school together, farther end, illustrious form, lower fourth, honour East's patronage time being, stood. The master mounted high desk door, one praepostors week stood steps, three marching middle school canes, calling out, “Silence, silence!” The sixth form stood close door left, thirty number, mostly great big grown men, Tom thought, surveying distance awe; fifth form behind them, twice number, quite big. These left; right lower fifth, will, junior forms order; middle marched three praepostors. Then praepostor stands master calls names, beginning sixth form; calls boy answers “here” name, walks out. Some sixth stop door turn whole string boys close. It great match-day, every boy school, he, nill he, must there. The rest sixth go forwards close, see one escapes side gates. To-day, however, School-house match, none School-house praepostors stay door watch truants side; carte blanche School-house fags go like. “They trust honour,” East proudly informs Tom; “they know well School-house boy would cut match. If did, would soon cut him, I tell you.” The master week short-sighted, praepostors week small well work, lower-school boys employ ten minutes elapse names called pelting one another vigorously acorns, fly directions. The small praepostors dash every then, generally chastise quiet, timid boy equally afraid acorns canes, principal performers get dexterously way. And calling-over rolls somehow, much like big world, punishments lighting wrong shoulders, matters going generally queer, cross-grained way, end coming somehow, is, all, great point. And master week finished, locked big school; praepostors week come out, sweeping last remnant school fags, loafing corners fives court, hopes chance bolting, close. “Hold punt-about!” “To goals!” cries; stray balls impounded authorities, whole mass boys moves towards two goals, dividing go three bodies. That little band left, consisting fifteen twenty boys, Tom amongst them, making goal School-house wall, School-house boys play up, stay goal. The larger body moving island goal School boys like predicament. The great mass middle players-up, sides mingled together; hanging jackets (and mean real work), hats, waistcoats, neck-handkerchiefs, braces, railings round small trees; go twos threes respective grounds. There none colour tastiness get-up, perceive, lends life present game Rugby, making dullest worst-fought match pretty sight. Now house uniform cap jersey, lively colour; time speaking plush caps yet come in, uniforms sort, except School-house white trousers, abominably cold to-day. Let us get work, bare-headed, girded plain leather straps. But mean business, gentlemen. And two sides fairly sundered, occupies ground, get good look them, absurdity this? You mean say fifty sixty boys white trousers, many quite small, going play huge mass opposite? Indeed I do, gentlemen. They going try, rate, make bad fight either, mark word; old Brooke toss, lucky halfpenny, got choice goals kick-off? The new ball may see lie quite itself, middle, pointing towards School island goal; another minute well way there. Use minute remarking Schoolhouse side drilled. You see, first place, sixth-form boy, charge goal, spread force (the goalkeepers) occupy whole space behind goal-posts, distances five yards apart. A safe well-kept goal foundation good play. Old Brooke talking captain quarters, moves away. See youngster spreads men (the light brigade) carefully ground, half-way goal body players-up (the heavy brigade). These play several bodies. There young Brooke bull-dogs. Mark well. They “fighting brigade,” “die-hards,” larking leap-frog keep warm, playing tricks one another. And side old Brooke, standing middle ground going kick off, see separate wing players-up, boy acknowledged prowess look to--here Warner, Hedge; old Brooke, absolute Russia, wisely bravely ruling willing worshipping subjects, true football king. His face earnest careful glances last time array, full pluck hope--the sort look I hope see general I go fight. The School side organized way. The goal-keepers lumps, anyhow nohow; cannot distinguish players-up boys quarters, divided leadership. But odds strength weight must take hinder winning; leaders seem think, let players-up manage themselves. But look! slight move forward School-house wings, shout “Are ready?” loud affirmative reply. Old Brooke takes half dozen quick steps, away goes ball spinning towards School goal, seventy yards touches ground, point twelve fifteen feet high, model kick-off; School-house cheer rush on. The ball returned, meet drive back amongst masses School already motion. Then two sides close, see nothing minutes swaying crowd boys, one point violently agitated. That ball is, keen players met, glory hard knocks got. You hear dull thud, thud ball, shouts “Off side,” “Down him,” “Put over,” “Bravo.” This call “a scrummage,” gentlemen, first scrummage School-house match joke consulship Plancus. But see! broken; ball driven School-house side, rush School carries past School-house players-up. “Look quarters,” Brooke's twenty voices ring out. No need call, though: School-house captain quarters caught bound, dodges foremost School boys, heading rush, sends back good drop-kick well enemy's country. And follows rush upon rush, scrummage upon scrummage, ball driven School-house quarters, School goal; School-house lost advantage kick-off slight wind gave outset, slightly “penning” adversaries. You say see much all--nothing struggling mass boys, leather ball seems excite great fury, red rag bull. My dear sir, battle would look much you, except boys would men, balls iron; battle would worth looking that, football match. You cannot expected appreciate delicate strokes play, turns game lost won--it takes old player that; broad philosophy football understand will. Come along little nearer, let us consider together. The ball fallen two sides thickest, close rapidly around scrummage. It must driven force skill, till flies one side other. Look differently boys face it! Here come two bulldogs, bursting outsiders; go, straight heart scrummage, bent driving ball opposite side. That mean do. My sons, sons! hot; gone past ball, must struggle right scrummage, get round back side, use. Here comes young Brooke; goes straight you, keeps head, backs bends, holding still behind ball, driving furiously gets chance. Take leaf book, young chargers. Here comes Speedicut, Flashman School-house bully, shouts great action. Will two come young Brooke, locking-up, School-house fire, “Old fellow, splendid scrummage three trees?” But knows you, we. You really want drive ball scrummage, chancing hurt glory School-house, make us think want--a vastly different thing; fellows kidney never go skirts scrummage, push kicking. We respect boys keep it, sham going in; you--we rather say think you. Then boys bending watching outside, mark them: useful players, dodgers, seize ball moment rolls amongst chargers, away across opposite goal. They seldom go scrummage, must coolness chargers. As endless boys' characters, ways facing facing scrummage football. Three-quarters hour gone; first winds failing, weight numbers beginning tell. Yard yard School-house driven back, contesting every inch ground. The bull-dogs colour mother earth shoulder ankle, except young Brooke, marvellous knack keeping legs. The School-house penned turn, ball behind goal, Doctor's wall. The Doctor family looking on, seem anxious boy success School-house. We get minute's breathing-time old Brooke kicks out, gives word play strongly touch, three trees. Away goes ball, bull-dogs it, another minute shout “In touch!” “Our ball!” Now's time, old Brooke, men still fresh. He stands ball hand, two sides form deep lines opposite one another; must strike straight them. The lines thickest close him, young Brooke two three men shifting farther, opposite line weak. Old Brooke strikes straight strong, falls opposite brother. Hurrah! rush taken right School line, away past three trees, far quarters, young Brooke bull-dogs close upon it. The School leaders rush back, shouting, “Look goal!” strain every nerve catch him, fleetest foot Rugby. There go straight School goal-posts, quarters scattering them. One another bull-dogs go down, young Brooke holds on. “He down.” No! long stagger, danger past. That shock Crew, dangerous dodgers. And close School goal, ball three yards him. There hurried rush School fags spot, one throws ball, chance, young Brooke touched right School goal-posts. The School leaders come furious, administer toco wretched fags nearest hand. They may well angry, Lombard Street china orange School-house kick goal ball touched good place. Old Brooke, course, kick out, shall catch place it? Call Crab Jones. Here comes, sauntering along straw mouth, queerest, coolest fish Rugby. If tumbled moon minute, would pick without taking hands pockets turning hair. But moment boldest charger's heart beats quick. Old Brooke stands ball arm motioning School back; kick till goal, behind posts. They edging forwards, inch inch, get nearer rush Crab Jones, stands front old Brooke catch ball. If reach destroy catches, danger over; one rush carry right away School-house goal. Fond hope! kicked caught beautifully. Crab strikes heel ground, mark spot ball caught, beyond school line may advance; stand, five deep, ready rush moment ball touches ground. Take plenty room. Do give rush chance reaching you. Place true steady. Trust Crab Jones. He made small hole heel ball lie on, resting one knee, eye old Brooke. “Now!” Crab places ball word, old Brooke kicks, rises slowly truly School rush forward. Then moment's pause, sides look spinning ball. There flies, straight two posts, five feet cross-bar, unquestioned goal; shout real, genuine joy rings School-house players-up, faint echo comes close goal-keepers Doctor's wall. A goal first hour--such thing done School-house match five years. “Over!” cry. The two sides change goals, School-house goal-keepers come threading way across masses School, openly triumphant them--amongst Tom, School-house boy two hours' standing--getting ears boxed transit. Tom indeed excited beyond measure, sixth-form boy, kindest safest goal-keepers, able do, keep rushing whenever ball near goal. So holds side, instructs science touching. At moment Griffith, itinerant vender oranges Hill Morton, enters close heavy baskets. There rush small boys upon little pale-faced man, two sides mingling together, subdued great goddess Thirst, like English French streams Pyrenees. The leaders past oranges apples, visit coats, apply innocent-looking ginger-beer bottles mouths. It ginger-beer though, I fear, good. One short mad rush, stitch side, honest play. That comes bottles. But Griffith's baskets empty, ball placed midway, School going kick off. Their leaders sent lumber goal, rated rest soundly, one hundred twenty picked players-up there, bent retrieving game. They keep ball front School-house goal, drive sheer strength weight. They mean heavy play mistake, old Brooke sees, places Crab Jones quarters goal, four five picked players keep ball away sides, try goal, obtained, less dangerous front. He himself, Warner Hedge, saved till now, lead charges. “Are ready?” “Yes.” And away comes ball, kicked high air, give School time rush catch falls. And amongst us. Meet like Englishmen, Schoolhouse boys, charge home. Now time show mettle you; shall warm seat hall fire, honour, lots bottled beer to-night duty next half-hour. And well met. Again cloud players-up gathers goal, comes threatening on, Warner Hedge, young Brooke relics bull-dogs, break carry ball back; old Brooke ranges field like Job's war-horse. The thickest scrummage parts asunder rush, like waves clipper's bows; cheery voice rings field, eye everywhere. And miss ball, rolls dangerously front goal, Crab Jones men seized sent away towards sides unerring drop-kick. This worth living for--the whole sum school-boy existence gathered one straining, struggling half-hour, half-hour worth year common life. The quarter five struck, play slackens minute goal; Crew, artful dodger, driving ball behind goal, island side, quarters weakest. Is one meet him? Yes; look little East! The ball equal distances two, rush together, young man seventeen boy twelve, kick moment. Crew passes without stagger; East hurled forward shock, plunges shoulder, would bury ground; ball rises straight air, falls behind Crew's back, “bravoes” School-house attest pluckiest charge hard-fought day. Warner picks East lame half stunned, hobbles back goal, conscious played man. And last minutes come, School gather last rush, every boy hundred twenty run left him. Reckless defence goal, come across level big-side ground, ball well amongst them, straight goal, like column Old Guard slope Waterloo. All former charges child's play this. Warner Hedge met them, still come. The bull-dogs rush last time; hurled carried back, striving hand, foot, eyelids. Old Brooke comes sweeping round skirts play, turning short round, picks heart scrummage, plunges in. It wavers moment; ball. No, passed him, voice rings clear advancing tide, “Look goal!” Crab Jones catches moment; kick, rush upon passes him; picks behind straw mouth, little dirtier, cool ever. The ball rolls slowly behind School-house goal, three yards front dozen biggest School players-up. There stands School-house praepostor, safest goal-keepers, Tom Brown side, learned trade time. Now time, Tom. The blood Browns up, two rush together, throw ball, feet advancing column--the praepostor hands knees, arching back, Tom along face. Over topple leaders rush, shooting back praepostor, falling flat Tom, knocking wind small carcass. “Our ball,” says praepostor, rising prize; “but get there; little fellow you.” They hauled roll him, Tom discovered, motionless body. Old Brooke picks up. “Stand back, give air,” says; feeling limbs, adds, “No bones broken.--How feel, young un?” “Hah-hah!” gasps Tom, wind comes back; “pretty well, thank you--all right.” “Who he?” says Brooke. “Oh, Brown; new boy; I know him,” says East, coming up. “Well, plucky youngster, make player,” says Brooke. And five clock strikes. “No side” called, first day School-house match over. CHAPTER VI--AFTER THE MATCH. “Some food had.”--Shakespeare. [Greek text]--Theocr. Id. As boys scattered away ground, East, leaning Tom's arm, limping along, beginning consider luxury go buy tea celebrate glorious victory, two Brookes came striding by. Old Brooke caught sight East, stopped; put hand kindly shoulder, said, “Bravo, youngster; played famously. Not much matter, I hope?” “No, nothing all,” said East--“only little twist charge.” “Well, mind get right next Saturday.” And leader passed on, leaving East better words opodeldoc England would made him, Tom ready give one ears much notice. Ah! light words love honour, power ye are, carelessly wielded use you! Surely things also God ask account. “Tea's directly locking-up, see,” said East, hobbling along fast could, “so come along Sally Harrowell's; School-house tuck-shop. She bakes stunning murphies, penn'orth tea. Come along, gone.” Tom's new purse money burnt pocket; wondered, toddled quadrangle along street, whether East would insulted suggested extravagance, sufficient faith pennyworth potatoes. At last blurted out,-- “I say, East, cannot get something else besides potatoes? I got lots money, know.” “Bless us, yes; I forgot,” said East, “you come. You see tin's gone twelve weeks--it hardly ever lasts beyond first fortnight; allowances stopped morning broken windows, I got penny. I got tick Sally's, course; I hate running high, see, towards end half, one directly one comes back, bore.” Tom understand much talk, seized fact East money, denying little pet luxury consequence. “Well, shall I buy?” said he, “I uncommon hungry.” “I say,” said East, stopping look rest leg, “you trump, Brown. I next half. Let us pound sausages then. That best grub tea I know of.” “Very well,” said Tom, pleased possible; “where sell them?” “Oh, here, opposite.” And crossed street walked cleanest little front room small house, half parlour, half shop, bought pound particular sausages, East talking pleasantly Mrs. Porter put paper, Tom paying part. From Porter's adjourned Sally Harrowell's, found lot School-house boys waiting roast potatoes, relating exploits day's match top voices. The street opened Sally's kitchen, low brick-floored room, large recess fire, chimney-corner seats. Poor little Sally, good-natured much-enduring womankind, bustling about, napkin hand, oven neighbours' cottages yard back house. Stumps, husband, short, easy-going shoemaker, beery, humorous eye ponderous calves, lived mostly wife's earnings, stood corner room, exchanging shots roughest description repartee every boy turn. “Stumps, lout, much beer to-day.” “'Twasn't paying for, then.” “Stumps's calves running ankles; want get grass.” “Better gone altogether like yours,” etc. Very poor stuff was, served make time pass; every Sally arrived middle smoking tin potatoes, cleared seconds, boy seized lot running house “Put two-penn'orth, Sally;” “Put three-penn'orth Davis,” etc. How ever kept accounts straight did, head slate, perfect wonder. East Tom got served last, started back School-house, locking-up bell began ring, East way recounting life adventures Stumps, character. Amongst small avocations, hind carrier sedan-chair, last race, Rugby ladies still went tea, which, fairly harnessed carrying load, delight small mischievous boys follow whip calves. This much temper even Stumps, would pursue tormentors vindictive apoplectic manner released, easily pacified twopence buy beer with. The lower-school boys School-house, fifteen number, tea lower-fifth school, presided old verger head-porter. Each boy quarter loaf bread pat butter, much tea pleased; scarcely one add luxury, baked potatoes, herring, sprats, something sort. But period half-year could live pound Porter's sausages, East great magnificence upon strength theirs. He produced toasting-fork study, set Tom toast sausages, mounted guard butter potatoes. “Because,” explained, “you new boy, play trick get butter; toast well I.” So Tom, midst three four urchins similarly employed, toasted face sausages time huge fire, till latter cracked; East watch-tower shouted done, feast proceeded, festive cups tea filled emptied, Tom imparted sausages small bits many neighbours, thought never tasted good potatoes seen jolly boys. They parts waived ceremony, pegged away sausages potatoes, remembering Tom's performance goal, voted East's new crony brick. After tea, things cleared away, gathered round fire, talk match still went on; show pulled trousers showed hacks received good because. They soon, however, turned school; East conducted Tom bedroom, might get clean things, wash singing. “What singing?” said Tom, taking head basin, plunging cold water. “Well, jolly green,” answered friend, neighbouring basin. “Why, last six Saturdays every half sing course; first them. No first lesson do, know, lie bed to-morrow morning.” “But sings?” “Why, everybody, course; see soon enough. We begin directly supper, sing till bed-time. It good fun now, though, summer half; sing little fives court, library, know. We take tables, big boys sit round drink beer--double allowance Saturday nights; cut quadrangle songs, looks like lot robbers cave. And louts come pound great gates, pound back again, shout them. But half sing hall. Come along study.” Their principal employment study clear East's table; removing drawers ornaments tablecloth; lived bottom passage, table requisition singing. Supper came due course seven clock, consisting bread cheese beer, saved singing; directly afterwards fags went work prepare hall. The School-house hall, said, great long high room, two large fires one side, two large iron-bound tables, one running middle, along wall opposite fireplaces. Around upper fire fags placed tables form horse-shoe, upon jugs Saturday night's allowance beer. Then big boys used drop take seats, bringing bottled beer song books; although knew songs heart, thing old manuscript book descended departed hero, carefully written out. The sixth-form boys yet appeared; so, fill gap, interesting time-honoured ceremony gone through. Each new boy placed table turn, made sing solo, penalty drinking large mug salt water resisted broke down. However, new boys sing like nightingales to-night, salt water requisition--Tom, part, performing old west-country song “The Leather Bottel” considerable applause. And half-hour come sixth fifth form boys, take places tables, filled next biggest boys, rest, room table, standing round outside. The glasses mugs filled, fugleman strikes old sea-song, “A wet sheet flowing sea, And wind follows fast,” etc., invariable first song School-house; seventy voices join in, mindful harmony, bent noise, attain decidedly, general effect bad. And follow “The British Grenadiers,” “Billy Taylor,” “The Siege Seringapatam,” “Three Jolly Postboys,” vociferous songs rapid succession, including “The Chesapeake Shannon,” song lately introduced honour old Brooke; come words, “Brave Broke waved sword, crying, Now, lads, aboard, And stop playing Yankee-doodle-dandy oh!” expect roof come down. The sixth fifth know “brave Broke” Shannon sort relation old Brooke. The fourth form uncertain belief, part hold old Brooke midshipman board uncle's ship. And lower school never doubt moment old Brooke led boarders, capacity care straw. During pauses bottled-beer corks fly rapidly, talk fast merry, big boys--at least fellow-feeling dry throats--hand mugs shoulders emptied small ones stand round behind. Then Warner, head house, gets wants speak; cannot, every boy knows coming. And big boys sit tables pound cheer; small boys stand behind pound one another, cheer, rush hall cheering. Then silence made, Warner reminds old School-house custom drinking healths, first night singing, going leave end half. “He sees know going say already” (loud cheers), “and keep them, ask treat toast deserves. It head eleven, head big-side football, leader glorious day--Pater Brooke!” And away goes pounding cheering again, becoming deafening old Brooke gets legs; till, table broken down, gallon beer upset, throats getting dry, silence ensues, hero speaks, leaning hands table, bending little forwards. No action, tricks oratory--plain, strong, straight, like play. “Gentlemen School-house! I proud way received name, I wish I could say I like return. But I know I shall not. However, I best I say seems ought said fellow going leave, spent good slice life here. Eight years is, eight years I never hope again. So I hope listen me” (loud cheers “That will”), “for I going talk seriously. You bound listen use calling 'pater,' that, mind I say? And I going talk seriously, I feel so. It jolly time, too, getting end half, goal kicked us first day” (tremendous applause), “after one hardest fiercest day's play I remember eight years.” (Frantic shoutings.) “The School played splendidly, too, I say, kept last. That last charge would carried away house. I never thought see anything old Crab there, except little pieces, I saw tumbled it.” (Laughter shouting, great slapping back Jones boys nearest him.) “Well, beat them.” (Cheers.) “Ay, beat them? Answer that.” (Shouts “Your play.”) “Nonsense! 'Twasn't wind kick-off either--that would it. 'Twasn't half dozen best players school, have. I would change Warner, Hedge, Crab, young un, six side.” (Violent cheers.) “But half dozen fellows cannot keep two hours two hundred. Why it, then? I tell I think. It reliance one another, house feeling, fellowship School have. Each us knows depend next-hand man better. That beat to-day. We union, division--there secret.” (Cheers.) “But kept up? How improved? That question. For I take earnest beating School, whatever else care about. I know I would sooner win two School-house matches running get Balliol scholarship day.” (Frantic cheers.) “Now, I proud house one. I believe best house school, out.” (Cheers.) “But long way I want see it. First, deal bullying going on. I know well. I pry interfere; makes underhand, encourages small boys come us fingers eyes telling tales, worse ever. It little kindness sixth meddle generally--you youngsters mind that. You better football players learning stand it, take parts, fight through. But depend it, nothing breaks house like bullying. Bullies cowards, one coward makes many; good-bye School-house match bullying gets ahead here.” (Loud applause small boys, look meaningly Flashman boys tables.) “Then fuddling public-house, drinking bad spirits, punch, rot-gut stuff. That make good drop-kicks chargers you, take word it. You get plenty good beer here, enough you; drinking fine manly, whatever may think it. “One thing I must word about. A lot think say, I heard you, 'There new Doctor long us, changing old customs. Rugby, Schoolhouse especially, going dogs. Stand good old ways, Doctor!' Now I fond old Rugby customs ways you, I longer you, I give word advice time, I like see getting sacked. 'Down Doctor's' easier said done. You find pretty tight perch, I take it, awkwardish customer handle line. Besides now, customs put down? There good old custom taking linchpins farmers' bagmen's gigs fairs, cowardly, blackguard custom was. We know came it, wonder Doctor objected it. But come now, you, name custom put down.” “The hounds,” calls fifth-form boy, clad green cutaway brass buttons cord trousers, leader sporting interest, reputed great rider keen hand generally. “Well, six seven mangy harriers beagles belonging house, I allow, years, Doctor put down. But good ever came them? Only rows keepers ten miles round; big-side hare-and-hounds better fun ten times over. What else?” No answer. “Well, I go on. Think yourselves. You find, I believe, meddle one worth keeping. And mind now, I say again, look squalls go way, way Doctor's, lead grief. You know I fellow back master thick thin. If I saw stopping football, cricket, bathing, sparring, I would ready fellow stand it. But not; encourages them. Did see to-day half hour watching us?” (loud cheers Doctor); “and strong, true man, wise one too, public-school man too” (cheers), “and let us stick him, talk rot, drink health head house.” (Loud cheers.) “And I done blowing up, glad I done. But solemn thing thinking leaving place one lived loved eight years; one say word good old house time, why, said, whether bitter sweet. If I proud house you--ay, one knows proud--I blowing up. And let us get singing. But I sit I must give toast drunk three-times-three honours. It toast I hope every one us, wherever may go hereafter, never fail drink thinks brave, bright days boyhood. It toast bind us together, gone come us here. It dear old School-house--the best house best school England!” My dear boys, old young, belonged, belong, schools houses, begin throwing poor little book room, abusing it, vowing read get point. I allow provocation it. But come now--would you, you, give fig fellow believe stand house school? You know would not. Then object cracking old School house, Rugby. Have I right it, I taking trouble writing true history benefits? If satisfied, go write history houses times, say know schools houses, provided true, I read without abusing you. The last words hit audience weakest place. They altogether enthusiastic several parts old Brooke's speech; “the best house best school England” much all, carried even sporting drinking interests legs rapturous applause, (it hoped) resolutions lead new life remember old Brooke's words--which, however, altogether do, appear hereafter. But required old Brooke's popularity carry parts speech--especially relating Doctor. For bigoted holders established forms customs, never foolish meaningless, English school-boys--at least, school-boys generation. We magnified heroes every boy left, looked upon awe reverence revisited place year afterwards, way Oxford Cambridge; happy boy remembered him, sure audience expounded used say, though sad enough stuff make angels, say head-masters, weep. We looked upon every trumpery little custom habit obtained School though law Medes Persians, regarded infringement variation sort sacrilege. And Doctor, man boy stronger liking old school customs good sensible, had, already hinted, come decided collision several neither one other. And old Brooke said, came collision boys customs, nothing give take off; said done, mistake it. And beginning pretty clearly understood. The boys felt strong man them, would things way, yet learnt wise loving man also. His personal character influence time make felt, except bigger boys came directly contact; looked upon great fear dislike great majority even house. For found School School-house state monstrous license misrule, still employed necessary unpopular work setting order strong hand. However, said, old Brooke triumphed, boys cheered Doctor. And songs came, healths boys leave, made speech, one flowery, another maudlin, third prosy, on, necessary recorded. Half-past nine struck middle performance “Auld Lang Syne,” obstreperous proceeding, immense amount standing one foot table, knocking mugs together shaking hands, without accompaniments seems impossible youths Britain take part famous old song. The under-porter School-house entered performance, bearing five six long wooden candlesticks lighted dips them, proceeded stick holes part great tables could get at; stood outside ring till end song, hailed shouts. “Bill old muff, half-hour struck.” “Here, Bill, drink cocktail.” “Sing us song, old boy.” “Do wish may get table?” Bill drank proffered cocktail unwillingly, putting empty glass, remonstrated. “Now gentlemen, ten minutes prayers, must get hall straight.” Shouts “No, no!” violent effort strike “Billy Taylor” third time. Bill looked appealingly old Brooke, got stopped noise. “Now then, lend hand, youngsters, get tables back; clear away jugs glasses. Bill's right. Open windows, Warner.” The boy addressed, sat long ropes, proceeded pull great windows, let clear, fresh rush night air, made candles flicker gutter, fires roar. The circle broke up, collaring jug, glass, song-book; Bill pounced big table, began rattle away place outside buttery door. The lower-passage boys carried small tables, aided friends; all, standing great hall-table, knot untiring sons harmony made night doleful prolonged performance “God Save King.” His Majesty King William Fourth reigned us, monarch deservedly popular amongst boys addicted melody, chiefly known beginning excellent slightly vulgar song much delighted,-- “Come, neighbours all, great small, Perform duties here, And loudly sing, 'Live Billy, king,' For bating tax upon beer.” Others learned songs also celebrated praises sort ballad, I take written Irish loyalist. I forgotten chorus, ran,-- “God save good King William, Be name ever blest; He father people, And guardian rest.” In troth loyal subjects days, rough way. I trust successors make much present Majesty, and, regard greater refinement times, adopted written songs equally hearty, civilized, honour. Then quarter ten struck, prayer-bell rang. The sixth fifth form boys ranged school order along wall, either side great fires, middle-fifth upper-school boys round long table middle hall, lower-school boys round upper part second long table, ran side hall farthest fires. Here Tom found bottom all, state mind body fit prayers, thought; tried hard make serious, could not, life him, anything repeat head choruses songs, stare boys opposite, wondering brilliancy waistcoats, speculating sort fellows were. The steps head-porter heard stairs, light gleams door. “Hush!” fifth-form boys stand there, strides Doctor, cap head, book one hand, gathering gown other. He walks middle, takes post Warner, begins calling names. The Doctor takes notice anything, quietly turns book finds place, stands, cap hand finger book, looking straight nose. He knows better one look, see nothing. To-night singing night, lots noise harm done--nothing beer drunk, nobody worse it, though look hot excited. So Doctor sees nothing, fascinates Tom horrible manner stands there, reads psalm, deep, ringing, searching voice his. Prayers over, Tom still stares open-mouthed Doctor's retiring figure, feels pull sleeve, turning round, sees East. “I say, ever tossed blanket?” “No,” said Tom; “why?” “Because tossing to-night, likely, sixth come bed. So funk, come along hide, else catch toss you.” “Were ever tossed? Does hurt?” inquired Tom. “Oh yes, bless you, dozen times,” said East, hobbled along Tom's side upstairs. “It hurt unless fall floor. But fellows like it.” They stopped fireplace top passage, crowd small boys whispering together, evidently unwilling go bedrooms. In minute, however, study door opened, sixth-form boy came out, scuttled stairs, noiselessly dispersed different rooms. Tom's heart beat rather quick East reached room, made mind. “I shall hide, East,” said he. “Very well, old fellow,” replied East, evidently pleased; “no shall I. They us directly.” The room great big one, dozen beds it, boy Tom could see except East himself. East pulled coat waistcoat, sat bottom bed whistling pulling boots. Tom followed example. A noise steps heard passage, door opens, rush four five great fifth-form boys, headed Flashman glory. Tom East slept farther corner room, seen first. “Gone ground, eh?” roared Flashman. “Push then, boys; look beds.” And pulled little white curtain one nearest him. “Who-o-op!” roared, pulling away leg small boy, held tight leg bed, sang lustily mercy. “Here, lend hand, one you, help pull young howling brute.--Hold tongue, sir, I kill you.” “Oh, please, Flashman, please, Walker, toss me! I fag you--I anything--only toss me.” “You hanged,” said Flashman, lugging wretched boy along; “'twon't hurt you,--you!--Come along, boys; is.” “I say, Flashey,” sang another big boys; “drop that; heard old Pater Brooke said to-night. I hanged toss one will. No bullying. Let go, I say.” Flashman, oath kick, released prey, rushed headlong bed again, fear change minds, crept along underneath beds, till got sixth-form boy, knew dare disturb. “There plenty youngsters care it,” said Walker. “Here, Scud East--you tossed, you, young un?” Scud East's nickname, Black, called it, gained fleetness foot. “Yes,” said East, “if like, mind foot.” “And another hide.--Hullo! new boy; name, sir?” “Brown.” “Well, Whitey Brown, mind tossed?” “No,” said Tom, setting teeth. “Come along then, boys,” sang Walker; away went, carrying along Tom East, intense relief four five small boys, crept beds behind them. “What trump Scud is!” said one. “They come back now.” “And new boy, too; must good-plucked one.” “Ah! wait till tossed floor; see like then!” Meantime procession went passage Number 7, largest room, scene tossing, middle great open space. Here joined parties bigger boys, captive two, willing tossed, sullen, frightened death. At Walker's suggestion afraid let off, honour Pater Brooke's speech. Then dozen big boys seized hold blanket, dragged one beds. “In Scud; quick! time lose.” East chucked blanket. “Once, twice, thrice, away!” Up went like shuttlecock, quite ceiling. “Now, boys, will,” cried Walker; “once, twice, thrice, away!” This time went clean up, kept touching ceiling hand, third time, turned out, went another boy. And came Tom's turn. He lay quite still, East's advice, dislike “once, twice, thrice;” “away” pleasant. They good wind now, sent slap ceiling first time, knees came rather sharply. But moment's pause descending rub--the feeling utter helplessness leaving whole inside behind sticking ceiling. Tom near shouting set found back blanket, thought East, not; took three tosses without kick cry, called young trump pains. He East, earned it, stood looking on. No catastrophe happened, captives cool hands, struggle. This suit Flashman. What real bully likes tossing boys kick struggle, hold one side blanket, get pitched bodily floor; fun one hurt frightened. “Let us toss two together, Walker,” suggested he. “What cursed bully are, Flashey!” rejoined other. “Up another one.” And two boys tossed together, peculiar hardship is, much human nature lie still share troubles; wretched pair small boys struggle air shall fall a-top descent, small risk falling blanket, huge delight brutes like Flashman. But cry praepostor room coming; tossing stops, scatter different rooms; Tom left turn in, first day's experience public school meditate upon. CHAPTER VII--SETTLING TO THE COLLAR. “Says Giles, 'It Is mortal hard go, But be's I must I means follow arter As goes hisself fust.'”--Ballad. Everybody, I suppose, knows dreamy, delicious state one lies, half asleep, half awake, consciousness begins return sound night's rest new place glad in, following upon day unwonted excitement exertion. There pleasanter pieces life. The worst last short time; nurse will, lying perfectly passive mind body, cannot make five minutes them. After time stupid, obtrusive, wakeful entity call “I”, impatient stiff-necked, spite teeth force back again, take possession us toes. It state Master Tom lay half-past seven morning following day arrival, clean little white bed watched movements Bogle (the generic name successive shoeblacks School-house known), marched round bed bed, collecting dirty shoes boots, depositing clean ones places. There lay, half doubtful exactly universe was, conscious made step life anxious make. It light looked lazily wide windows, saw tops great elms, rooks circling cawing remonstrances lazy ones commonwealth starting body neighbouring ploughed fields. The noise room-door closing behind Bogle, made exit shoebasket arm, roused thoroughly, sat bed looked round room. What world could matter shoulders loins? He felt severely beaten back--the natural results performance first match. He drew knees rested chin them, went events yesterday, rejoicing new life, seen it, come. Presently one two boys roused themselves, began sit talk one another low tones. Then East, roll two, came anchor also, nodding Tom, began examining ankle. “What pull,” said he, “that lie-in-bed, I shall lame tree, I think.” It Sunday morning, Sunday lectures yet established; nothing breakfast intervened bed eleven clock chapel--a gap means easy fill up: fact, though received correct amount grumbling, first lecture instituted Doctor shortly afterwards great boon School. It lie-in-bed, one hurry get up, especially rooms sixth-form boy good-tempered fellow, case Tom's room, allowed small boys talk laugh pretty much pleased, long disturb him. His bed bigger one rest, standing corner fireplace, washing-stand large basin side, lay state white curtains tucked form retiring place--an awful subject contemplation Tom, slept nearly opposite, watched great man rouse take book pillow, begin reading, leaning head hand, turning back room. Soon, however, noise striving urchins arose, muttered encouragements neighbouring boys “Go it, Tadpole!” “Now, young Green!” “Haul away blanket!” “Slipper hands!” Young Green little Hall, commonly called Tadpole, great black head thin legs, slept side side far away door, ever playing one another tricks, usually ended, morning, open violent collision; now, unmindful order authority, were, hauling away other's bedclothes one hand, other, armed slipper, belabouring whatever portion body adversary came within reach. “Hold noise corner,” called praepostor, sitting looking round curtains; Tadpole young Green sank disordered beds; then, looking watch, added, “Hullo! past eight. Whose turn hot water?” (Where praepostor particular ablutions, fags room descend turn kitchen, beg steal hot water him; often custom extended farther, two boys went every morning get supply whole room.) “East's Tadpole's,” answered senior fag, kept rota. “I cannot go,” said East; “I dead lame.” “Well, quick you, all,” said great man, turned bed, putting slippers, went great passage, runs whole length bedrooms, get Sunday habiliments portmanteau. “Let go you,” said Tom East; “I like it.” “Well, thank 'ee, good fellow. Just pull trousers, take jug mine. Tadpole show way.” And Tom Tadpole, nightshirts trousers, started downstairs, “Thos's hole,” little buttery, candles beer bread cheese served night, called, across School-house court, long passage, kitchen; where, parley stalwart, handsome cook, declared filled dozen jugs already, got hot water, returned speed great caution. As was, narrowly escaped capture privateers fifth-form rooms, lookout hot-water convoys, pursued door room, making spill half load passage. “Better going though,” Tadpole remarked, “as beggars caught us.” By time calling-over bell rang, Tom new comrades down, dressed best clothes, satisfaction answering “here” name first time, praepostor week put bottom list. And came breakfast saunter close town East, whose lameness became severe fagging done. And whiled away time morning chapel. It fine November morning, close soon became alive boys ages, sauntered grass, walked round gravel walk, parties two three. East, still cicerone, pointed remarkable characters Tom passed: Osbert, could throw cricket-ball little-side ground rook-trees Doctor's wall; Gray, got Balliol scholarship, and, East evidently thought much importance, half-holiday School success; Thorne, run ten miles two minutes hour; Black, held cock town last row louts; many heroes, walked worshipped, trace long since vanished scene fame. And fourth-form boy reads names rudely cut old hall tables, painted upon big-side cupboard (if hall tables big-side cupboards still exist), wonders manner boys were. It wonder, sons, whatever prowess may cricket, scholarship, football. Two three years, less, steadily advancing, blessed wave pass names passed ours. Nevertheless, play games work manfully--see done--and let remembrance take care itself. The chapel-bell began ring quarter eleven, Tom got early took place lowest row, watched boys come take places, filling row row; tried construe Greek text inscribed door slightest possible success, wondered masters, walked chapel took seats exalted boxes end, would lord. And came closing doors, Doctor robes, service, which, however, impress much, feeling wonder curiosity strong. And boy one side scratching name oak panelling front, could help watching see name was, whether well scratched; boy side went sleep, kept falling him; whole, though many boys even part school serious attentive, general atmosphere means devotional; got close again, feel comfortable, church. But afternoon chapel quite another thing. He spent time dinner writing home mother, better frame mind; first curiosity over, could attend service. As hymn prayers sung, chapel getting little dark, beginning feel really worshipping. And came great event his, every Rugby boy's life day--the first sermon Doctor. More worthy pens mine described scene--the oak pulpit standing School seats; tall, gallant form, kindling eye, voice, soft low notes flute, clear stirring call light-infantry bugle, stood Sunday Sunday, witnessing pleading Lord, King righteousness love glory, whose Spirit filled, whose power spoke; long lines young faces, rising tier tier whole length chapel, little boy's left mother young man's going next week great world, rejoicing strength. It great solemn sight, never time year, lights chapel pulpit seats praepostors week, soft twilight stole rest chapel, deepening darkness high gallery behind organ. But it, all, seized held three hundred boys, dragging themselves, willing unwilling, twenty minutes, Sunday afternoons? True, always boys scattered School, heart head worthy hear able carry away deepest wisest words spoken. But minority always, generally small one, often small one countable fingers hand. What moved held us, rest three hundred reckless, childish boys, feared Doctor hearts, little besides heaven earth; thought sets School Church Christ, put traditions Rugby public opinion boys daily life laws God? We could enter half heard; knowledge hearts knowledge one another, little enough faith, hope, love needed end. But listened, boys better moods listen (ay, men matter that), man felt be, heart soul strength, striving whatever mean unmanly unrighteous little world. It cold, clear voice one giving advice warning serene heights struggling sinning below, warm, living voice one fighting us sides, calling us help one another. And so, wearily little little, surely steadily whole, brought home young boy, first time, meaning life--that fool's sluggard's paradise wandered chance, battlefield ordained old, spectators, youngest must take side, stakes life death. And roused consciousness showed time, every word spoke pulpit, whole daily life, battle fought, stood fellow-soldier captain band--the true sort captain, too, boy's army--one misgivings, gave uncertain word command, and, let would yield make truce, would fight fight (so every boy felt) last gasp last drop blood. Other sides character might take hold influence boys there; thoroughness undaunted courage which, anything else, way hearts great mass left mark, made believe first Master. It quality others moved boys hero, nothing whatever remarkable except excess boyishness--by I mean animal life fullest measure, good nature honest impulses, hatred injustice meanness, thoughtlessness enough sink three-decker. And so, next two years, doubtful whether would get good evil School, steady purpose principle grew him, whatever week's sins shortcomings might been, hardly ever left chapel Sunday evenings without serious resolve stand follow Doctor, feeling cowardice (the incarnation sins boy's mind) hindered heart. The next day Tom duly placed third form, began lessons corner big School. He found work easy, well grounded, knew grammar heart; and, intimate companions make idle (East School-house friends lower fourth, form him), soon gained golden opinions master, said placed low, put end half-year. So went well School, wrote flourishing letters home mother, full success unspeakable delights public school. In house, too, went well. The end half-year drawing near, kept everybody good humour, house ruled well strongly Warner Brooke. True, general system rough hard, bullying nooks corners--bad signs future; never got farther, dared show openly, stalking passages hall bedrooms, making life small boys continual fear. Tom, new boy, right excused fagging first month, enthusiasm new life privilege hardly pleased him; East others young friends, discovering this, kindly allowed indulge fancy, take turns night fagging cleaning studies. These principal duties fags house. From supper nine clock three fags taken order stood passages, answered praepostor called “Fag,” racing door, last comer work. This consisted generally going buttery beer bread cheese (for great men sup rest, allowance study fifth-form room), cleaning candlesticks putting new candles, toasting cheese, bottling beer, carrying messages house; Tom, first blush hero-worship, felt high privilege receive orders bearer supper old Brooke. And besides night-work, praepostor three four fags specially allotted him, supposed guide, philosopher, friend, return good offices clean study every morning turns, directly first lesson returned breakfast. And pleasure seeing great men's studies, looking pictures, peeping books, made Tom ready substitute boy lazy work. And soon gained character good-natured, willing fellow, ready turn one. In games, too, joined heart, soon became well versed mysteries football, continual practice School-house little-side, played daily. The incident worth recording here, however, first run hare-and-hounds. On last Tuesday one half-year passing hall dinner, hailed shouts Tadpole several fags seated one long tables, chorus was, “Come help us tear scent.” Tom approached table obedience mysterious summons, always ready help, found party engaged tearing old newspapers, copy-books, magazines, small pieces, filling four large canvas bags. “It turn house find scent big-side hare-and-hounds,” exclaimed Tadpole. “Tear away; time lose calling-over.” “I think great shame,” said another small boy, “to hard run last day.” “Which run it?” said Tadpole. “Oh, Barby run, I hear,” answered other; “nine miles least, hard ground; chance getting finish, unless first-rate scud.” “Well, I going try,” said Tadpole; “it last run half, fellow gets end big-side stands ale bread cheese bowl punch; Cock's famous place ale.” “I like try too,” said Tom. “Well, then, leave waistcoat behind, listen door, calling-over, hear meet is.” After calling-over, sure enough two boys door, calling out, “Big-side hare-and-hounds meet White Hall;” Tom, girded leather strap, left superfluous clothing behind, set White Hall, old gable-ended house quarter mile town, East, persuaded join, notwithstanding prophecy could never get in, hardest run year. At meet found forty fifty boys, Tom felt sure, seen many run football, East likely get they. After minutes' waiting, two well-known runners, chosen hares, buckled four bags filled scent, compared watches young Brooke Thorne, started long, slinging trot across fields direction Barby. Then hounds clustered round Thorne, explained shortly, “They six minutes' law. We run Cock, every one comes within quarter hour hares'll counted, round Barby church.” Then came minute's pause so, watches pocketed, pack led gateway field hares first crossed. Here break trot, scattering field find first traces scent hares throw go along. The old hounds make straight likely points, minute cry “Forward” comes one them, whole pack, quickening pace, make spot, boy hit scent first, two three nearest him, first fence, making play along hedgerow long grass-field beyond. The rest pack rush gap already made, scramble through, jostling one another. “Forward” again, half through. The pace quickens sharp run, tail hounds straining get lucky leaders. They gallant hares, scent lies thick right across another meadow ploughed field, pace begins tell; good wattle ditch side, large pasture studded old thorns, slopes first brook. The great Leicestershire sheep charge away across field pack comes racing slope. The brook small one, scent lies right ahead opposite slope, thick ever--not turn check favour tail hounds, strain on, trailing long line, many youngster beginning drag legs heavily, feel heart beat like hammer, bad-plucked ones thinking worth keep up. Tom, East, Tadpole good start, well young hands, rising slope crossing next field, find leading hounds, overrun scent, trying back. They come mile half eleven minutes, pace shows last day. About twenty-five original starters show here, rest already given in; leaders busy making casts fields left right, others get second winds. Then comes cry “Forward” young Brooke, extreme left, pack settles work steadily doggedly, whole keeping pretty well together. The scent, though still good, thick; need that, part run every one knows line must taken, casts made, good downright running fencing done. All mean coming in, come foot Barby Hill without losing two three pack. This last straight two miles half always vantage ground hounds, hares know well; generally viewed side Barby Hill, eyes lookout to-day. But sign appears, hard work hounds, nothing cast scent, hares' turn, may baffle pack dreadfully next two miles. Ill fares youngsters, School-house boys, follow young Brooke, takes wide casts round left, conscious powers, loving hard work. For would consider moment, small boys, would remember Cock, run ends good ale going, lies far right Dunchurch road, every cast take left much extra work. And stage run, evening closing already, one remarks whether run little cunning not; stick crafty hounds keep edging away right, follow prodigal like young Brooke, whose legs twice long cast-iron, wholly indifferent one two miles less. However, struggle him, sobbing plunging along, Tom East pretty close, Tadpole, whose big head begins pull down, thirty yards behind. Now comes brook, stiff clay banks, hardly drag legs, hear faint cries help wretched Tadpole, fairly stuck fast. But little run left pull brothers. Three fields more, another check, “Forward” called away extreme right. The two boys' souls die within them; never it. Young Brooke thinks too, says kindly, “You cross lane next field; keep it, hit Dunchurch road Cock,” steams away run in, sure first, starting. They struggle across next field, “forwards” getting fainter fainter, ceasing. The whole hunt ear-shot, hope coming over. “Hang all!” broke East, soon got wind enough, pulling hat mopping face, spattered dirt lined sweat, went thick steam still, cold air. “I told would be. What thick I come! Here are, dead beat, yet I know close run in, knew country.” “Well,” said Tom, mopping away, gulping disappointment, “it cannot helped. We best anyhow. Had better find lane, go it, young Brooke told us?” “I suppose so--nothing else it,” grunted East. “If ever I go last day again.” Growl, growl, growl. So tried back slowly sorrowfully, found lane, went limping it, plashing cold puddly ruts, beginning feel run taken them. The evening closed fast, clouded over, dark, cold, dreary. “I say, must locking-up, I think,” remarked East, breaking silence--“it dark.” “What late?” said Tom. “No tea, sent Doctor,” answered East. The thought add cheerfulness. Presently faint halloo heard adjoining field. They answered stopped, hoping competent rustic guide them, gate twenty yards ahead crawled wretched Tadpole, state collapse. He lost shoe brook, groping elbows stiff, wet clay, miserable creature shape boy seldom seen. The sight him, notwithstanding, cheered them, degrees wretched they. They also cheered him, longer dread passing night alone fields. And so, better heart, three plashed painfully never-ending lane. At last widened, utter darkness set in, came turnpike road, paused, bewildered, lost bearings, knew whether turn right left. Luckily decide, lumbering along road, one lamp lighted two spavined horses shafts, came heavy coach, moment's suspense recognized Oxford coach, redoubtable Pig Whistle. It lumbered slowly up, boys, mustering last run, caught passed, began clambering behind, exploit East missed footing fell flat nose along road. Then others hailed old scarecrow coachman, pulled agreed take shilling; sat back seat, drubbing heels, teeth chattering cold, jogged Rugby forty minutes locking-up. Five minutes afterwards three small, limping, shivering figures steal along Doctor's garden, house servants' entrance (all gates closed long since), first thing light upon passage old Thomas, ambling along, candle one hand keys other. He stops examines condition grim smile. “Ah! East, Hall, Brown, late locking-up. Must go Doctor's study once.” “Well but, Thomas, may go wash first? You put time, know.” “Doctor's study d'rectly come in--that orders,” replied old Thomas, motioning towards stairs end passage led Doctor's house; boys turned ruefully it, cheered old verger's muttered remark, “What pickle boys in!” Thomas referred faces habiliments, construed indicating Doctor's state mind. Upon short flight stairs paused hold counsel. “Who go first?” inquires Tadpole. “You--you senior,” answered East. “Catch me. Look state I in,” rejoined Hall, showing arms jacket. “I must get behind two.” “Well, look me,” said East, indicating mass clay behind standing; “I worse you, two one. You might grow cabbages trousers.” “That below, keep legs behind sofa,” said Hall. “Here, Brown; show-figure. You must lead.” “But face muddy,” argued Tom. “Oh, one boat matter; come on; making worse, dawdling here.” “Well, give us brush then,” said Tom. And began trying rub superfluous dirt other's jackets; dry enough, rubbing made worse; despair pushed swing-door head stairs, found Doctor's hall. “That library door,” said East whisper, pushing Tom forwards. The sound merry voices laughter came within, first hesitating knock unanswered. But second, Doctor's voice said, “Come in;” Tom turned handle, he, others behind him, sidled room. The Doctor looked task; working away great chisel bottom boy's sailing boat, lines doubt fashioning model one Nicias's galleys. Round stood three four children; candles burnt brightly large table farther end, covered books papers, great fire threw ruddy glow rest room. All looked kindly, homely, comfortable boys took heart moment, Tom advanced behind shelter great sofa. The Doctor nodded children, went out, casting curious amused glances three young scarecrows. “Well, little fellows,” began Doctor, drawing back fire, chisel one hand coat-tails other, eyes twinkling looked over; “what makes late?” “Please, sir, big-side hare-and-hounds, lost way.” “Hah! could keep up, I suppose?” “Well, sir,” said East, stepping out, liking Doctor think lightly running powers, “we got round Barby right; then--” “Why, state in, boy!” interrupted Doctor, pitiful condition East's garments fully revealed him. “That fall I got, sir, road,” said East, looking himself; “the Old Pig came by--” “The what?” said Doctor. “The Oxford coach, sir,” explained Hall. “Hah! yes, Regulator,” said Doctor. “And I tumbled face, trying get behind,” went East. “You hurt, I hope?” said Doctor. “Oh no, sir.” “Well now, run upstairs, three you, get clean things on, tell housekeeper give tea. You young try long runs. Let Warner know I seen you. Good-night.” “Good-night, sir.” And away scuttled three boys high glee. “What brick, give us even twenty lines learn!” said Tadpole, reached bedroom; half hour afterwards sitting fire housekeeper's room sumptuous tea, cold meat--“Twice good grub got hall,” Tadpole remarked grin, mouth full buttered toast. All grievances forgotten, resolving go first big-side next half, thinking hare-and-hounds delightful games. A day two afterwards great passage outside bedrooms cleared boxes portmanteaus, went packed matron, great games chariot-racing, cock-fighting, bolstering went vacant space, sure sign closing half-year. Then came making parties journey home, Tom joined party hire coach, post four horses Oxford. Then last Saturday, Doctor came round form give prizes, hear master's last reports charges conducting themselves; Tom, huge delight, praised, got remove lower fourth, School-house friends were. On next Tuesday morning four clock hot coffee going housekeeper's matron's rooms; boys wrapped great-coats mufflers swallowing hasty mouthfuls, rushing about, tumbling luggage, asking questions matron; outside School-gates drawn several chaises four-horse coach Tom's party chartered, postboys best jackets breeches, cornopean player, hired occasion, blowing away “A southerly wind cloudy sky,” waking peaceful inhabitants half-way High Street. Every minute bustle hubbub increased: porters staggered boxes bags, cornopean played louder. Old Thomas sat den great yellow bag side, paying journey-money boy, comparing light solitary dip dirty, crabbed little list handwriting Doctor's list amount cash; head one side, mouth screwed up, spectacles dim early toil. He prudently locked door, carried operations solely window, would driven wild lost money. “Thomas, quick; shall never catch Highflyer Dunchurch.” “That money right, Green.” “Hullo, Thomas, Doctor said I two pound ten; given two pound.” (I fear Master Green confining strictly truth.) Thomas turns head one side ever, spells away dirty list. Green forced away window. “Here, Thomas--never mind him; mine's thirty shillings.” “And mine too,” “And mine,” shouted others. One way another, party Tom belonged got packed paid, sallied gates, cornopean playing frantically “Drops Brandy,” allusion, probably, slight potations musician postboys already indulging. All luggage carefully stowed away inside coach front hind boots, hat-box visible outside. Five six small boys, pea-shooters, cornopean player, got behind; front big boys, mostly smoking, pleasure, gentlemen large, correct public method notifying fact. “Robinson's coach road minute; gone Bird's pick up. We wait till close, make race it,” says leader. “Now, boys, half sovereign apiece beat Dunchurch one hundred yards.” “All right, sir,” shouted grinning postboys. Down comes Robinson's coach minute two, rival cornopean, away go two vehicles, horses galloping, boys cheering, horns playing loud. There special providence school-boys well sailors, must upset twenty times first five miles--sometimes actually abreast one another, boys roofs exchanging volleys peas; nearly running post-chaise started them; half-way bank; wheel half yawning ditch: dark morning, nothing lamps guide them. However, last, run nothing old pig Southam Street. The last peas distributed Corn Market Oxford, arrive eleven twelve, sit sumptuous breakfast Angel, made pay accordingly. Here party breaks up, going different ways; Tom orders chaise pair grand lord, though scarcely five shillings left pocket, twenty miles get home. “Where to, sir?” “Red Lion, Farringdon,” says Tom, giving hostler shilling. “All right, sir.--Red Lion, Jem,” postboy; Tom rattles away towards home. At Farringdon, known innkeeper, gets worthy pay Oxford horses, forward another chaise once; gorgeous young gentleman arrives paternal mansion, Squire Brown looks rather blue pay two pound ten shillings posting expenses Oxford. But boy's intense joy getting home, wonderful health in, good character brings, brave stories tells Rugby, doings delights, soon mollify Squire, three happier people sit dinner day England (it boy's first dinner six clock home--great promotion already) Squire wife Tom Brown, end first half-year Rugby. CHAPTER VIII--THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. “They slaves choose Hatred, scoffing, abuse, Rather silence shrink From truth needs must think; They slaves dare In right two three.” --LOWELL, Stanzas Freedom. The lower-fourth form, Tom found beginning next half-year, largest form lower school, numbered upwards forty boys. Young gentlemen ages nine fifteen found there, expended part energies devoted Latin Greek upon book Livy, “Bucolics” Virgil, “Hecuba” Euripides, ground small daily portions. The driving unlucky lower-fourth must grievous work unfortunate master, unhappily constituted school. Here stuck great stupid boys, who, life them, could never master accidence--the objects alternately mirth terror youngsters, daily taking laughing lesson, getting kicked play-hours. There less three unhappy fellows tail coats, incipient chins, Doctor master form always endeavouring hoist upper school, whose parsing construing resisted well-meant shoves. Then came mass form, boys eleven twelve, mischievous reckless age British youth, East Tom Brown fair specimens. As full tricks monkeys, excuses Irishwomen, making fun master, one another, lessons, Argus would puzzled keep eye them; making steady serious half hour together, simply hopeless. The remainder form consisted young prodigies nine ten, going school rate form half-year, boys' hands wits progress. It would one man's work see precocious youngsters fair play; master good deal besides do, not, ever shoved three four places, verses stolen, books inked, jackets whitened, lives otherwise made burden them. The lower-fourth, forms it, heard great school, trusted prepare lessons coming in, whipped school three-quarters hour lesson began respective masters, there, scattered benches, dictionary grammar, hammered twenty lines Virgil Euripides midst babel. The masters lower school walked great school together three-quarters hour, sat desks reading looking copies, keeping order possible. But lower-fourth overgrown form, large one man attend properly, consequently elysium ideal form young scapegraces formed staple it. Tom, said, come third good character, temptations lower-fourth soon proved strong him, rapidly fell away, became unmanageable rest. For weeks, indeed, succeeded maintaining appearance steadiness, looked upon favourably new master, whose eyes first opened following little incident. Besides desk master occupied, another large unoccupied desk corner great school, untenanted. To rush seize upon desk, ascended three steps held four boys, great object ambition lower-fourthers; contentions occupation bred disorder last master forbade use altogether. This, course, challenge adventurous spirits occupy it; capacious enough two boys lie hid completely, seldom remained empty, notwithstanding veto. Small holes cut front, occupants watched masters walked down; lesson time approached, one boy time stole steps, masters' backs turned, mingled general crowd forms below. Tom East successfully occupied desk half-dozen times, grown reckless habit playing small games fives balls inside masters end big school. One day, ill-luck would it, game became exciting usual, ball slipped East's fingers, rolled slowly steps middle school, masters turned walk faced round upon desk. The young delinquents watched master, lookout holes, march slowly school straight upon retreat, boys neighbourhood, course, stopped work look on; ignominiously drawn out, caned hand there, characters steadiness gone time. However, shared fate three-fourths rest form, weigh heavily upon them. In fact, occasions cared matter monthly examinations, Doctor came round examine form, one long, awful hour, work done preceding month. The second monthly examination came round soon Tom's fall, anything lively anticipations lower-fourth boys came prayers morning examination day. Prayers calling-over seemed twice short usual, could get construes tithe hard passages marked margin books, seated round, Doctor standing middle, talking whispers master. Tom could hear word passed, never lifted eyes book; knew sort magnetic instinct Doctor's under-lip coming out, eye beginning burn, gown getting gathered tightly left hand. The suspense agonizing, Tom knew sure occasions make example School-house boys. “If would begin,” thought Tom, “I mind.” At last whispering ceased, name called Brown. He looked moment, Doctor's face awful; Tom would met eye worth, buried book again. The boy called first clever, merry School-house boy, one set; connection Doctor's, great favourite, ran house liked, selected first victim. “Triste lupus stabulis,” began luckless youngster, stammered eight ten lines. “There, do,” said Doctor; “now construe.” On common occasions boy could construed passage well enough probably, head gone. “Triste lupus, sorrowful wolf,” began. A shudder ran whole form, Doctor's wrath fairly boiled over. He made three steps construer, gave good box ear. The blow hard one, boy taken surprise started back; form caught back knees, went floor behind. There dead silence whole school. Never never Tom school Doctor strike boy lesson. The provocation must great. However, victim saved form occasion, Doctor turned top bench, put best boys rest hour though, end lesson, gave rating forget, terrible field-day passed without severe visitations shape punishments floggings. Forty young scapegraces expressed thanks “sorrowful wolf” different ways second lesson. But character steadiness gone easily recovered, Tom found; years afterwards went school without it, masters' hands him, them. And regarded them, matter course, natural enemies. Matters comfortable, either, house been; old Brooke left Christmas, one two others sixth-form boys following Easter. Their rule rough, strong main, higher standard beginning set up; fact, short foretaste good time followed years later. Just now, however, threatened return darkness chaos again. For new praepostors either small young boys, whose cleverness carried top school, strength body character yet fit share government; else big fellows wrong sort--boys whose friendships tastes downward tendency, caught meaning position work, felt none responsibilities. So no-government School-house began see bad times. The big fifth-form boys, sporting drinking set, soon began usurp power, fag little boys praepostors, bully oppress showed signs resistance. The bigger sort sixth-form boys described soon made common fifth, smaller sort, hampered colleagues' desertion enemy, could make head them. So fags without lawful masters protectors, ridden rough-shod set boys bound obey, whose right stood bodily powers; and, old Brooke prophesied, house degrees broke small sets parties, lost strong feeling fellowship set much store by, much prowess games lead school matters done much keep up. In place world individual character weight public school. Remember this, I beseech you, boys getting upper forms. Now time lives, probably, may wide influence good evil society live ever again. Quit like men, then; speak up, strike necessary, whatsoever true, manly, lovely, good report; never try popular, duty help others theirs, may leave tone feeling school higher found it, good living soul measure generations countrymen yet unborn. For boys follow one another herds like sheep, good evil; hate thinking, rarely settled principles. Every school, indeed, traditionary standard right wrong, cannot transgressed impunity, marking certain things low blackguard, certain others lawful right. This standard ever varying, though changes slowly little little; and, subject standard, leading boys time give tone rest, make School either noble institution training Christian Englishmen, place young boy get evil would turned make way London streets, anything two extremes. The change worse School-house, however, press heavily youngsters time. They good bedroom, slept praepostor left able keep thorough order, study passage. So, though fagged less, occasionally kicked cuffed bullies, were, whole, well off; fresh, brave school-life, full games, adventures, good-fellowship, ready forgetting, capacious enjoying, bright forecasting, outweighed thousand-fold troubles master form, occasional ill-usage big boys house. It till year events recorded praepostor room passage left. None sixth-form boys would move passage, and, disgust indignation Tom East, one morning breakfast seized upon Flashman, made carry books furniture unoccupied study, taken. From time began feel weight tyranny Flashman friends, and, trouble come home doors, began look sympathizers partners amongst rest fags; meetings oppressed began held, murmurs arise, plots laid free avenged enemies. While matters state, East Tom one evening sitting study. They done work first lesson, Tom brown study, brooding, like young William Tell, upon wrongs fags general, particular. “I say, Scud,” said last, rousing snuff candle, “what right fifth-form boys fag us do?” “No right fag them,” answered East, without looking early number “Pickwick,” coming out, luxuriously devouring, stretched back sofa. Tom relapsed brown study, East went reading chuckling. The contrast boys' faces would given infinite amusement looker-on--the one solemn big mighty purpose, radiant bubbling fun. “Do know, old fellow, I thinking good deal,” began Tom again. “Oh yes, I know--fagging thinking of. Hang all! But listen here, Tom--here fun. Mr. Winkle's horse--” “And I made mind,” broke Tom, “that I fag except sixth.” “Quite right too, boy,” cried East, putting finger place looking up; “but pretty peck troubles get into, going play game. However, I strike myself, get others join. It getting bad.” “Cannot get sixth-form fellow take up?” asked Tom. “Well, perhaps might. Morgan would interfere, I think. Only,” added East, moment's pause, “you see, tell it, School principles. Do remember old Brooke said learning take parts?” “Ah, I wish old Brooke back again. It right time.” “Why, yes, see, strongest best fellows sixth, fifth-form fellows afraid them, kept good order; sixth-form fellows small, fifth care them, like house.” “And get double set masters,” cried Tom indignantly--“the lawful ones, responsible Doctor rate, unlawful, tyrants, responsible nobody.” “Down tyrants!” cried East; “I law order, hurrah revolution.” “I mind young Brooke now,” said Tom; “he good-hearted, gentlemanly fellow, ought sixth. I would anything him. But blackguard Flashman, never speaks one without kick oath--” “The cowardly brute,” broke East--“how I hate him! And knows too; knows I think coward. What bore got study passage! Do hear supper den? Brandy-punch going, I bet. I wish Doctor would come catch him. We must change study soon can.” “Change change, I never fag again,” said Tom, thumping table. “Fa-a-a-ag!” sounded along passage Flashman's study. The two boys looked one another silence. It struck nine, regular night-fags left duty, nearest supper-party. East sat up, began look comical, always difficulties. “Fa-a-a-ag!” again. No answer. “Here, Brown! East! cursed young skulks,” roared Flashman, coming open door; “I know in; shirking.” Tom stole door, drew bolts noiselessly could; East blew candle. “Barricade first,” whispered he. “Now, Tom, mind, surrender.” “Trust that,” said Tom teeth. In another minute heard supper-party turn come passage door. They held breaths, heard whispering, made Flashman's words, “I know young brutes in.” Then came summonses open, unanswered, assault commenced. Luckily door good strong oak one, resisted united weight Flashman's party. A pause followed, heard besieger remark, “They safe enough. Do see door holds top bottom? So bolts must drawn. We forced lock long ago.” East gave Tom nudge, call attention scientific remark. Then came attacks particular panels, one last gave way repeated kicks; broke inwards, broken pieces got jammed across (the door lined green baize), could easily removed outside: besieged, scorning concealment, strengthened defences pressing end sofa door. So, one two ineffectual efforts, Flashman Company retired, vowing vengeance mild terms. The first danger over, remained besieged effect safe retreat, near bed-time. They listened intently, heard supper-party resettle themselves, gently drew back first one bolt other. Presently convivial noises began steadily. “Now then, stand run,” said East, throwing door wide open rushing passage, closely followed Tom. They quick caught; Flashman lookout, sent empty pickle-jar whizzing them, narrowly missed Tom's head, broke twenty pieces end passage. “He would mind killing one, caught,” said East, turned corner. There pursuit, two turned hall, found knot small boys round fire. Their story told. The war independence broken out. Who would join revolutionary forces? Several others present bound fag fifth form once. One two edged off, left rebels. What else could do? “I good mind go Doctor straight,” said Tom. “That never do. Do remember levy school last half?” put another. In fact, solemn assembly, levy School, held, captain School got up, premising several instances occurred matters reported masters; public morality School tradition; levy sixth held subject, resolved practice must stopped once; given boy, whatever form, thenceforth appeal master, without first gone praepostor laid case him, thrashed publicly, sent Coventry. “Well, then, let us try sixth. Try Morgan,” suggested another. “No use”--“Blabbing do,” general feeling. “I give fellows piece advice,” said voice end hall. They turned round start, speaker got bench lying unobserved, gave shake. He big, loose-made fellow, huge limbs grown far jacket trousers. “Do go anybody all--you stand out; say fag. They soon get tired licking you. I tried years ago forerunners.” “No! Did you? Tell us was?” cried chorus voices, clustered round him. “Well, you. The fifth form would fag us, I struck, beat them. The good fellows left directly, bullies kept soon got afraid.” “Was Flashman then?” “Yes; dirty, little, snivelling, sneaking fellow too. He never dared join us, used toady bullies offering fag them, peaching rest us.” “Why cut, then?” said East. “Oh, toadies never get cut; useful. Besides, end great hampers home, wine game them; toadied fed favour.” The quarter-to-ten bell rang, small boys went upstairs, still consulting together, praising new counsellor, stretched bench hall fire again. There lay, queer specimen boyhood, name Diggs, familiarly called “the Mucker.” He young size, clever fellow, nearly top fifth. His friends home, regard, I suppose, age, size place school, put tails; even jackets always small; talent destroying clothes making look shabby. He terms Flashman's set, sneered dress ways behind back; knew, revenged asking Flashman disagreeable questions, treating familiarly whenever crowd boys round him. Neither intimate bigger boys, warned oddnesses, queer fellow; besides, amongst failings, impecuniosity remarkable degree. He brought much money boys school, got rid time, one knew how; then, also reckless, borrowed one; debts accumulated creditors pressed, would auction hall everything possessed world, selling even school-books, candlestick, study table. For weeks one auctions, rendered study uninhabitable, would live fifth-form room hall, verses old letter-backs odd scraps paper, learning lessons one knew how. He never meddled little boy, popular them, though looked sort compassion, called “Poor Diggs,” able resist appearances, disregard wholly even sneers enemy Flashman. However, seemed equally indifferent sneers big boys pity small ones, lived queer life much apparent enjoyment himself. It necessary introduce Diggs thus particularly, Tom East good service present warfare, told, soon afterwards, got sixth, chose fags, excused study-fagging, thereby earning unto eternal gratitude interested history. And seldom small boys need friend, morning siege storm burst upon rebels violence. Flashman laid wait, caught Tom second lesson, receiving point-blank “No” told fetch hat, seized twisted arm, went methods torture use. “He could make cry, though,” Tom said triumphantly rest rebels; “and I kicked shins well, I know.” And soon crept lot fags league, Flashman excited associates join bringing young vagabonds senses; house filled constant chasings, sieges, lickings sorts; return, bullies' beds pulled pieces drenched water, names written walls every insulting epithet fag invention could furnish. The war, short, raged fiercely; soon, Diggs told them, better fellows fifth gave trying fag them, public feeling began set Flashman two three intimates, obliged keep doings secret, thorough bad fellows, missed opportunity torturing private. Flashman adept ways, power saying cutting cruel things, could often bring tears eyes boys way, thrashings world would wrung them. And operations cut short directions, devoted chiefly Tom East, lived door, would force study whenever found chance, sit there, sometimes alone, sometimes companion, interrupting work, exulting evident pain every could see inflicting one other. The storm cleared air rest house, better state things began since old Brooke left; angry, dark spot thunder-cloud still hung end passage Flashman's study East Tom lay. He felt first rebels, rebellion great extent successful; stirred hatred bitterness heart frequent collisions late openly called coward sneak. The taunts true forgiven. While act thrashing them, would roar instances funking football, shirking encounter lout half size. These things well enough known house, disgrace shouted small boys, feel despised him, unable silence amount torture, see open laugh sneer associates (who looking on, took trouble hide scorn him, though neither interfered bullying lived bit less intimately him), made beside himself. Come might, would make boys' lives miserable. So strife settled personal affair Flashman youngsters--a war knife, fought little cockpit end bottom passage. Flashman, said, seventeen years old, big strong age. He played well games pluck much wanted, managed generally keep appearances was; bluff, off-hand manner, passed heartiness, considerable powers pleasant liked, went school general good fellow enough. Even School-house, dint command money, constant supply good things kept up, adroit toadyism, managed make tolerated, rather popular amongst contemporaries; although young Brooke scarcely spoke him, one two others right sort showed opinions whenever chance offered. But wrong sort happened ascendant now, Flashman formidable enemy small boys. This soon became plain enough. Flashman left slander unspoken, deed undone, could way hurt victims, isolate rest house. One one rebels fell away them, Flashman's prospered, several fifth-form boys began look black ill-treat passed house. By keeping bounds, events house quadrangle, day, carefully barring night, East Tom managed hold without feeling miserable; much could do. Greatly drawn towards old Diggs, who, uncouth way, began take good deal notice them, twice came study Flashman there, immediately decamped consequence. The boys thought Diggs must watching. When therefore, time, auction one night announced take place hall, which, amongst superfluities boys, Diggs's penates time going hammer, East Tom laid heads together, resolved devote ready cash (some four shillings sterling) redeem articles sum would cover. Accordingly, duly attended bid, Tom became owner two lots Diggs's things:--Lot 1, price one-and-threepence, consisting (as auctioneer remarked) “valuable assortment old metals,” shape mouse-trap, cheese-toaster without handle, saucepan: Lot 2, villainous dirty table-cloth green-baize curtain; East, one-and-sixpence, purchased leather paper-case, lock key, handsome, much worse wear. But still point settle get Diggs take things without hurting feelings. This solved leaving study, never locked out. Diggs, attended auction, remembered bought lots, came study soon after, sat silent time, cracking great red finger-joints. Then laid hold verses, began looking altering them, last got up, turning back them, said, “You uncommon good-hearted little beggars, two. I value paper-case; sister gave last holidays. I forget.” And tumbled passage, leaving somewhat embarrassed, sorry knew done. The next morning Saturday, day allowances one shilling week paid--an important event spendthrift youngsters; great disgust amongst small fry hear allowances impounded Derby lottery. That great event English year, Derby, celebrated Rugby days many lotteries. It improving custom, I own, gentle reader, led making books, betting, objectionable results; great Houses Palaver think right stop nation's business day many members bet heavily themselves, blame us boys following example betters? At rate follow it. First great school lottery, first prize six seven pounds; house one separate lotteries. These nominally voluntary, boy compelled put shilling choose so. But besides Flashman, three four fast, sporting young gentlemen Schoolhouse, considered subscription matter duty necessity; so, make duty come easy small boys, quietly secured allowances lump given distribution, kept them. It use grumbling--so many fewer tartlets apples eaten fives balls bought Saturday; locking-up, money would otherwise spent, consolation carried many small boy sound night-fags shouting along passages, “Gentlemen sportsmen School-house; lottery's going drawn hall.” It pleasant called gentleman sportsman, also chance drawing favourite horse. The hall full boys, head one long tables stood sporting interest, hat them, tickets folded up. One began calling list house. Each boy name called drew ticket hat, opened it; bigger boys, drawing, left hall directly go back studies fifth-form room. The sporting interest drawn blanks, sulky accordingly; neither favourites yet drawn, come upper-fourth. So now, small boy came drew ticket, seized opened Flashman, standers-by. But great favourite drawn comes Tadpole's turn, shuffles draws, tries make off, caught, ticket opened like rest. “Here are! Wanderer--the third favourite!” shouts opener. “I say, give ticket, please,” remonstrates Tadpole. “Hullo! hurry,” breaks Flashman; “what sell Wanderer now?” “I want sell,” rejoins Tadpole. “Oh, you! Now listen, young fool: know anything it; horse use you. He win, I want hedge. Now, I give half crown him.” Tadpole holds out, threats cajoleries length sells half one shilling sixpence--about fifth fair market value; however, glad realize anything, and, wisely remarks, “Wanderer may win, tizzy safe anyhow.” East presently comes draws blank. Soon comes Tom's turn. His ticket, like others, seized opened. “Here then,” shouts opener, holding up--“Harkaway!--By Jove, Flashey, young friend's luck.” “Give ticket,” says Flashman, oath, leaning across table open hand face black rage. “Would like it?” replies opener, bad fellow bottom, admirer Flashman. “Here, Brown, catch hold.” And hands ticket Tom, pockets it. Whereupon Flashman makes door once, Tom ticket may escape, keeps watch drawing boys gone, except sporting set five six, stay compare books, make bets, on; Tom, choose move Flashman door; East, stays friend, anticipating trouble. The sporting set gathered round Tom. Public opinion would allow actually rob ticket, humbug intimidation could driven sell whole part undervalue lawful. “Now, young Brown, come, sell Harkaway for? I hear going start. I give five shillings him,” begins boy opened ticket. Tom, remembering good deed, moreover forlorn state wishing make friend, accept offer, another cries out, “I give seven shillings.” Tom hesitated looked one other. “No, no!” said Flashman, pushing in, “leave deal him; draw lots afterwards. Now sir, know me: sell Harkaway us five shillings, repent it.” “I sell bit him,” answered Tom shortly. “You hear now!” said Flashman, turning others. “He coxiest young blackguard house. I always told so. We trouble risk getting lotteries benefit fellows he.” Flashman forgets explain risk ran, speaks willing ears. Gambling makes boys selfish cruel well men. “That true. We always draw blanks,” cried one.--“Now, sir, shall sell half, rate.” “I not,” said Tom, flushing hair, lumping mind sworn enemy. “Very well then; let us roast him,” cried Flashman, catches hold Tom collar. One two boys hesitate, rest join in. East seizes Tom's arm, tries pull away, knocked back one boys, Tom dragged along struggling. His shoulders pushed mantelpiece, held main force fire, Flashman drawing trousers tight way extra torture. Poor East, pain even Tom, suddenly thinks Diggs, darts find him. “Will sell ten shillings?” says one boy relenting. Tom answers groans struggles. “I say, Flashey, enough,” says boy, dropping arm holds. “No, no; another turn'll it,” answers Flashman. But poor Tom done already, turns deadly pale, head falls forward breast, Diggs, frantic excitement, rushes hall East heels. “You cowardly brutes!” say, catches Tom supports hall table. “Good God! dying. Here, get cold water--run housekeeper.” Flashman one two others slink away; rest, ashamed sorry, bend Tom run water, East darts housekeeper. Water comes, throw hands face, begins come to. “Mother!”--the words came feebly slowly--“it cold to-night.” Poor old Diggs blubbering like child. “Where I?” goes Tom, opening eyes, “Ah! I remember now.” And shut eyes groaned. “I say,” whispered, “we cannot good, housekeeper minute.” And one steal away. He stays Diggs, silent sorrowful, fans Tom's face. The housekeeper comes strong salts, Tom soon recovers enough sit up. There smell burning. She examines clothes, looks inquiringly. The boys silent. “How come so?” No answer. “There bad work here,” adds, looking serious, “and I shall speak Doctor it.” Still answer. “Had better carry sick-room?” suggests Diggs. “Oh, I walk now,” says Tom; and, supported East housekeeper, goes sick-room. The boy held ground soon amongst rest, fear lives. “Did peach?” “Does know it?” “Not word; stanch little fellow.” And pausing moment, adds, “I sick work; brutes been!” Meantime Tom stretched sofa housekeeper's room, East side, gets wine water restoratives. “Are much hurt, dear old boy?” whispers East. “Only back legs,” answers Tom. They indeed badly scorched, part trousers burnt through. But soon bed cold bandages. At first feels broken, thinks writing home getting taken away; verse hymn learned years ago sings head, goes sleep, murmuring,-- “Where wicked cease troubling, And weary rest.” But sound night's rest, old boy-spirit comes back again. East comes in, reporting whole house him; forgets everything, except old resolve never beaten bully Flashman. Not word could housekeeper extract either them, though Doctor knew knew morning, never knew more. I trust believe scenes possible school, lotteries betting-books gone out; I writing schools time, must give evil good. CHAPTER IX--A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS. “Wherein I [speak] disastrous chances, Of moving accidents flood field, Of hair-breadth 'scapes.”--SHAKESPEARE. When Tom came back school couple days sick-room, found matters much changed better, East led expect. Flashman's brutality disgusted even intimate friends, cowardice made plain house; Diggs encountered morning lottery, high words sides, struck him, blow returned. However, Flashey unused sort thing, lived awkward affairs before, and, Diggs said, fed toadied back favour again. Two three boys helped roast Tom came begged pardon, thanked telling anything. Morgan sent him, inclined take matter warmly, Tom begged it; agreed, Tom's promising come future--a promise which, I regret say, keep. Tom kept Harkaway himself, second prize lottery, thirty shillings, East contrived spend three days purchase pictures study, two new bats cricket-ball--all best could got--and supper sausages, kidneys, beef-steak pies rebels. Light come, light go; would comfortable money pockets middle half. The embers Flashman's wrath, however, still smouldering, burst every sly blows taunts, felt quite done yet. It long, however, last act drama came, end bullying Tom East Rugby. They often stole hall nights, incited thereto partly hope finding Diggs talk him, partly excitement something rules; for, sad say, youngsters, since loss character steadiness form, got habit things forbidden, matter adventure,--just way, I fancy, men fall smuggling, sort reasons--thoughtlessness first place. It never occurred consider rules laid down: reason nothing them, looked upon rules sort challenge rule-makers, would rather bad pluck accept; again, lower parts school enough do. The work form could manage get pretty easily, keeping good enough place get regular yearly remove; much ambition beyond this, whole superfluous steam available games scrapes. Now, one rule house daily pleasure boys break supper fags, except three duty passages, remain studies nine clock; caught passages hall, one another's studies, liable punishments caning. The rule stricter observance; sixth spent evenings fifth-form room, library was, lessons learnt common. Every then, however, praepostor would seized fit district visiting, would make tour passages hall fags' studies. Then, owner entertaining friend two, first kick door ominous “Open here” effect shadow hawk chicken-yard: every one cut cover--one small boy diving sofa, another table, owner would hastily pull book two open them, cry meek voice, “Hullo, there?” casting anxious eye round see protruding leg elbow could betray hidden boys. “Open, sir, directly; Snooks.” “Oh, I sorry; I know you, Snooks.” And well-feigned zeal door would opened, young hopeful praying beast Snooks might heard scuffle caused coming. If study empty, Snooks proceeded draw passages hall find truants. Well, one evening, forbidden hours, Tom East hall. They occupied seats fire nearest door, Diggs sprawled usual farther fire. He busy copy verses, East Tom chatting together whispers light fire, splicing favourite old fives bat sprung. Presently step came bottom passage. They listened moment, assured praepostor, went work, door swung open, walked Flashman. He see Diggs, thought good chance keep hand in; boys move him, struck one them, make get way. “What for?” growled assaulted one. “Because I choose. You business here. Go study.” “You cannot send us.” “Cannot I? Then I thrash stay,” said Flashman savagely. “I say, two,” said Diggs, end hall, rousing resting elbow--“you never get rid fellow till lick him. Go him, you. I see fair play.” Flashman taken aback, retreated two steps. East looked Tom. “Shall try!” said he. “Yes,” said Tom desperately. So two advanced Flashman, clenched fists beating hearts. They shoulder, tough boys age, perfect training; he, though strong big, poor condition monstrous habit stuffing want exercise. Coward was, however, Flashman could swallow insult this; besides, confident easy work, faced boys, saying, “You impudent young blackguards!” Before could finish abuse, rushed him, began pummelling could reach. He hit wildly savagely; full force blows tell--they near him. It long odds, though, point strength; another minute Tom went spinning backwards form, Flashman turned demolish East savage grin. But Diggs jumped table seated himself. “Stop there,” shouted he; “the round's over--half-minute time allowed.” “What --- you?” faltered Flashman, began lose heart. “I going see fair, I tell you,” said Diggs, grin, snapping great red fingers; “'taint fair fighting one time.--Are ready, Brown? Time's up.” The small boys rushed again. Closing, saw, best chance, Flashman wilder flurried ever: caught East throat, tried force back iron-bound table. Tom grasped waist, remembering old throw learned Vale Harry Winburn, crooked leg inside Flashman's, threw whole weight forward. The three tottered moment, went floor, Flashman striking head form hall. The two youngsters sprang legs, lay still. They began frightened. Tom stooped down, cried out, scared wits, “He bleeding awfully. Come here, East! Diggs, dying!” “Not he,” said Diggs, getting leisurely table; “it sham; afraid fight out.” East frightened Tom. Diggs lifted Flashman's head, groaned. “What matter?” shouted Diggs. “My skull's fractured,” sobbed Flashman. “Oh, let run housekeeper!” cried Tom. “What shall do?” “Fiddlesticks! It nothing skin broken,” said relentless Diggs, feeling head. “Cold water bit rag's want.” “Let go,” said Flashman surlily, sitting up; “I want help.” “We really sorry--” began East. “Hang sorrow!” answered Flashman, holding handkerchief place; “you shall pay this, I tell you, you.” And walked hall. “He cannot bad,” said Tom, deep sigh, much relieved see enemy march well. “Not he,” said Diggs; “and see troubled more. But, I say, head's broken too; collar covered blood.” “Is though?” said Tom, putting hand; “I know it.” “Well, mop up, jacket spoilt. And got nasty eye, Scud. You would better go bathe well cold water.” “Cheap enough too, done old friend Flashey,” said East, made upstairs bathe wounds. They done Flashman one sense, never laid finger either again; whatever harm spiteful heart venomous tongue could them, took care done. Only throw dirt enough, sure stick; fifth form bigger boys general, associated less, all. Flashman managed get Tom East disfavour, wear time author disappeared School world. This event, much prayed small fry general, took place months encounter. One fine summer evening Flashman regaling gin-punch, Brownsover; and, exceeded usual limits, started home uproarious. He fell friend two coming back bathing, proposed glass beer, assented, weather hot, thirsty souls, unaware quantity drink Flashman already board. The short result was, Flashey became beastly drunk. They tried get along, could not; chartered hurdle two men carry him. One masters came upon them, naturally enough fled. The flight rest raised master's suspicions, good angel fags incited examine freight, and, examination, convoy hurdle School-house; Doctor, long eye Flashman, arranged withdrawal next morning. The evil men boys lives them: Flashman gone, boys, hinted above, still felt effects hate. Besides, movers strike unlawful fagging. The righteous--the result triumphant great extent; best fifth--even never fagged small boys, given practice cheerfully--could help feeling small grudge first rebels. After all, form defied, grounds, doubt--so just, indeed, acknowledged wrong, remained passive strife. Had sided Flashman set, rebels must given way once. They could help, whole, glad acted, resistance successful form shown fight; felt law order gained thereby, ringleaders could quite pardon once. “Confoundedly coxy young rascals get, mind,” general feeling. So is, must always, dear boys. If angel Gabriel come heaven, head successful rise abominable unrighteous vested interest poor old world groans under, would certainly lose character many years, probably centuries, upholders said vested interest, respectable mass people delivered. They would ask dinner, let names appear papers; would careful spoke Palaver, clubs. What expect, then, poor gallant blundering men like Kossuth, Garibaldi, Mazzini, righteous causes triumph hands--men holes enough armour, God knows, easy hit respectabilities sitting lounging chairs, large balances bankers'? But brave, gallant boys, hate easy-chairs, balances bankers. You want heads set straight, take right side; bear mind majorities, especially respectable ones, nine times ten wrong; see man boy striving earnestly weak side, however wrong-headed blundering may be, go join cry him. If cannot join help him, make wiser, rate remember found something world fight suffer for, got yourselves; think speak tenderly. So East Tom, Tadpole, one two more, became sort young Ishmaelites, hands every one, every one's hand them. It already told got war masters fifth form, sixth much same. They saw praepostors cowed joining fifth shirking duties; respect them, rendered willing obedience. It one thing clean studies sons heroes like old Brooke, quite another like Snooks Green, never faced good scrummage football, could keep passages order night. So slurred fagging well enough escape licking, always that, got character sulky, unwilling fags. In fifth-form room, supper, matters often discussed arranged, names ever coming up. “I say, Green,” Snooks began one night, “is new boy, Harrison, fag?” “Yes; why?” “Oh, I know something home, like excuse him. Will swop?” “Who give me?” “Well, let us see. There Willis, Johnson. No, do. Yes, I it. There young East; I give him.” “Do wish may get it?” replied Green. “I give two Willis, like.” “Who, then?” asked Snooks. “Hall Brown.” “Would gift.” “Better East, though; quite sharp,” said Green, getting leaning back mantelpiece. He bad fellow, could help able put unruly fifth form. His eye twinkled went on, “Did I ever tell young vagabond sold last half?” “No; how?” “Well, never half cleaned study out--only stuck candlesticks cupboard, swept crumbs floor. So last I mortal angry, up, made go whole performance eyes. The dust young scamp made nearly choked me, showed swept carpet before. Well, finished, 'Now, young gentleman,' says I, 'mind, I expect done every morning--floor swept, table-cloth taken shaken, everything dusted.' 'Very well,' grunts he. Not bit though. I quite sure, day two, never took table-cloth even. So I laid trap him. I tore paper, put half dozen bits table one night, cloth usual. Next morning breakfast I came, pulled cloth, and, sure enough, paper, fluttered floor. I towering rage. 'I got now,' thought I, sent him, I got cane. Up came cool please, hands pockets. 'Did I tell shake table-cloth every morning?' roared I. 'Yes,' says he. 'Did morning?' 'Yes.' 'You young liar! I put pieces paper table last night, would taken table-cloth would seen them, I going give good licking.' Then youngster takes one hand pocket, stoops picks two bits paper, holds me. There written each, great round text, 'Harry East, mark.' The young rogue found trap out, taken away paper, put there, every bit ear-marked. I would great mind lick impudence; but, all, one right laying traps, I not. Of course I mercy till end half, weeks study frowzy I could sit it.” “They spoil one's things so, too,” chimed third boy. “Hall Brown night-fags last week. I called 'fag,' gave candlesticks clean. Away went, appear again. When would time enough clean three times over, I went look them. They passages I went hall, I heard music; I found sitting table, listening Johnson, playing flute, candlesticks stuck bars well fire, red-hot, clean spoiled. They never stood straight since, I must get more. However, I gave good licking; one comfort.” Such sort scrapes always getting into; so, partly faults, partly circumstances, partly faults others, found outlaws, ticket-of-leave men, line--in short, dangerous parties--and lived sort hand-to-mouth, wild, reckless life parties generally put with. Nevertheless never quite lost favour young Brooke, cock house, getting sixth; Diggs stuck like man, gave store good advice, never least profited. And even house mended, law order restored, soon happened young Brooke Diggs got sixth, could easily return paths steadiness, many old, wild, out-of-bounds habits stuck firmly ever. While quite little boys, scrapes got School much mattered one; upper school, wrong-doers sent straight Doctor once. So began come notice; sort leaders small way amongst contemporaries, eye, everywhere, upon them. It toss-up whether turned well ill, boys caused anxiety master. You told first occasion sent Doctor, remembrance pleasant much less fear boys standing had. “It look,” Tom used say East, “that frightens fellows. Do remember, never said anything us first half-year hour late locking-up?” The next time Tom came him, however, interview different kind. It happened time arrived, first series scrapes hero managed tumble. The river Avon Rugby slow clear stream, chub, dace, roach, coarse fish (or were) plentiful enough, together fair sprinkling small jack, fish worth sixpence either sport food. It is, however, capital river bathing, many nice small pools several good reaches swimming, within mile one another, easy twenty minutes' walk school. This mile water rented, used rented, bathing purposes trustees School, boys. The footpath Brownsover crosses river “the Planks,” curious old single-plank bridge running fifty sixty yards flat meadows side river--for winter frequent floods. Above Planks bathing-places smaller boys--Sleath's, first bathing-place, new boys begin, proved bathing men (three steady individuals, paid attend daily summer prevent accidents) could swim pretty decently, allowed go Anstey's, one hundred fifty yards below. Here hole six feet deep twelve feet across, puffing urchins struggled opposite side, thought small beer depths. Below Planks came larger deeper holes, first Wratislaw's, last Swift's, famous hole, ten twelve feet deep parts, thirty yards across, fine swimming reach right mill. Swift's reserved sixth fifth forms, spring board two sets steps: others one set steps each, used indifferently lower boys, though house addicted one hole another. The School-house time affected Wratislaw's hole, Tom East, learnt swim like fishes, found regular clock summer, always twice, often three times day. Now boys either had, fancied had, right also fish pleasure whole part river, would understand right (if any) extended Rugby side. As ill-luck would it, gentleman owned opposite bank, allowing time without interference, ordered keepers let boys fish side--the consequence first wranglings fights keepers boys; keen quarrel become landlord keepers, ducking inflicted one latter, fierce fight ensued thereon, great school calling-over identify delinquents, Doctor five six masters could keep peace. Not even authority could prevent hissing; strong feeling four praepostors week walked school canes, shouting “S-s-s-s-i-lenc-c-c-c-e” top voices. However, chief offenders time flogged kept bounds; victorious party brought nice hornet's nest ears. The landlord hissed School-gates rode past, charged horse mob boys, tried thrash whip, driven back cricket-bats wickets, pursued pebbles fives balls; wretched keepers' lives burden them, watch waters closely. The School-house boys Tom's standing, one all, protest tyranny cutting short lawful amusements, took fishing ways, especially means night-lines. The little tacklemaker bottom town would soon made fortune rage lasted, several barbers began lay fishing-tackle. The boys great advantage enemies, spent large portion day nature's garb river-side, so, tired swimming, would get side fish, set night-lines, till keepers hove sight, plunge swim back mix bathers, keepers wise follow across stream. While things state, one day Tom three four others bathing Wratislaw's, had, matter course, taking re-setting night-lines. They left water, sitting standing toilets, costumes, shirt upwards, aware man velveteen shooting-coat approaching side. He new keeper, recognize notice him, till pulled right opposite, began: “I see'd young gentlemen side a-fishing now.” “Hullo! you? What business yours, old Velveteens?” “I new under-keeper, master's told keep sharp lookout young chaps. And I tells 'ee I means business, would better keep side, shall fall out.” “Well, right, Velveteens; speak out, let us know mind once.” “Look here, old boy,” cried East, holding miserable, coarse fish two small jack; “would like smell see bank lived under?” “I give bit advice, keeper,” shouted Tom, sitting shirt paddling feet river: “you would better go Swift's, big boys are; beggars setting lines, and'll put wrinkle two catching five-pounders.” Tom nearest keeper, officer, getting angry chaff, fixed eyes hero, take note future use. Tom returned gaze steady stare, broke laugh, struck middle favourite School-house song,-- “As I companions Were setting snare The gamekeeper watching us; For care: For wrestle fight, boys, And jump anywhere. For delight likely night, In season year.” The chorus taken boys shouts laughter, keeper turned away grunt, evidently bent mischief. The boys thought matter. But came May-fly season; soft, hazy summer weather lay sleepily along rich meadows Avon side, green gray flies flickered graceful, lazy up-and-down flight reeds water meadows, myriads upon myriads. The May-flies must surely lotus-eaters ephemerae--the happiest, laziest, carelessest fly dances dreams hours sunshiny life English rivers. Every little pitiful, coarse fish Avon alert flies, gorging wretched carcass hundreds daily, gluttonous rogues! every lover gentle craft avenge poor May-flies. So one fine Thursday afternoon, Tom, borrowed East's new rod, started river. He fished time small success--not fish would rise him; prowled along bank, presently aware mighty ones feeding pool opposite side, shade huge willow-tree. The stream deep here, fifty yards shallow, made hot-foot; forgetting landlords, keepers, solemn prohibitions Doctor, everything else, pulled trousers, plunged across, three minutes creeping along fours towards clump willows. It often great chub, coarse fish, earnest anything; thoroughly bent feeding, half hour Master Tom deposited three thumping fellows foot giant willow. As baiting fourth pounder, going throw again, became aware man coming bank one hundred yards off. Another look told under-keeper. Could reach shallow him? No, carrying rod. Nothing tree. So Tom laid bones it, shinning fast could, dragging rod him. He time reach crouch along upon huge branch ten feet up, stretched river, keeper arrived clump. Tom's heart beat fast came tree; two steps would passed, when, ill-luck would it, gleam scales dead fish caught eye, made dead point foot tree. He picked fish one one; eye touch told alive feeding within hour. Tom crouched lower along branch, heard keeper beating clump. “If I could get rod hidden,” thought he, began gently shifting get alongside him; “willowtrees throw straight hickory shoots twelve feet long, leaves, worse luck.” Alas! keeper catches rustle, sight rod, Tom's hand arm. “Oh, ther', 'ee?” says he, running tree. “Now come minute.” “Tree'd last,” thinks Tom, making answer, keeping close possible, working away rod, takes pieces. “I it, unless I starve out.” And begins meditate getting along branch plunge, scramble side; small branches thick, opposite bank difficult, keeper lots time get round ford get out, gives up. And hears keeper beginning scramble trunk. That never do; scrambles back branch joins trunk; stands lifted rod. “Hullo, Velveteens; mind fingers come higher.” The keeper stops looks up, grin says, “Oh! you, it, young measter? Well, luck. Now I tells 'ee come once, 't'll best 'ee.” “Thank 'ee, Velveteens; I comfortable,” said Tom, shortening rod hand, preparing battle. “Werry well; please yourself,” says keeper, descending, however, ground again, taking seat bank. “I bean't hurry, may take time. I l'arn 'ee gee honest folk names afore I done 'ee.” “My luck usual,” thinks Tom; “what fool I give black! If I would called 'keeper,' now, I might get off. The return match way.” The keeper quietly proceeded take pipe, fill, light it, keeping eye Tom, sat disconsolately across branch, looking keeper--a pitiful sight men fishes. The thought less liked it. “It must getting near second calling-over,” thinks he. Keeper smokes stolidly. “If takes up, I shall flogged safe enough. I cannot sit night. Wonder rise silver.” “I say, keeper,” said meekly, “let go two bob?” “Not twenty neither,” grunts persecutor. And sat till long past second calling-over, sun came slanting willow-branches, telling locking-up near hand. “I coming down, keeper,” said Tom last, sigh, fairly tired out. “Now going do?” “Walk 'ee School, give 'ee Doctor; them's orders,” says Velveteens, knocking ashes fourth pipe, standing shaking himself. “Very good,” said Tom; “but hands off, know. I go quietly, collaring sort thing.” Keeper looked minute. “Werry good,” said last. And Tom descended, wended way drearily side keeper, Schoolhouse, arrived locking-up. As passed School-gates, Tadpole several others standing caught state things, rushed out, crying, “Rescue!” But Tom shook head; followed Doctor's gate, went back sorely puzzled. How changed stern Doctor seemed last time Tom there, keeper told story, omitting state Tom called blackguard names. “Indeed, sir,” broke culprit, “it Velveteens.” The Doctor asked one question. “You know rule banks, Brown?” “Yes, sir.” “Then wait to-morrow, first lesson.” “I thought so,” muttered Tom. “And rod, sir?” went keeper. “Master's told might rods--” “Oh, please, sir,” broke Tom, “the rod mine.” The Doctor looked puzzled; keeper, good-hearted fellow, melted Tom's evident distress, gave claim. Tom flogged next morning, days afterwards met Velveteens, presented half crown giving rod claim, became sworn friends; I regret say Tom many fish willow May-fly season, never caught Velveteens. It three weeks Tom, East side, awful presence. This time, however, Doctor terrible. A days before, fagged fives fetch balls went court. While standing watching game, saw five six nearly new balls hit top School. “I say, Tom,” said East, dismissed, “could get balls somehow?” “Let us try, anyhow.” So reconnoitred walls carefully, borrowed coal-hammer old Stumps, bought big nails, one two attempts, scaled Schools, possessed huge quantities fives balls. The place pleased much spent spare time there, scratching cutting names top every tower; last, exhausted places, finished inscribing H.EAST, T.BROWN, minute-hand great clock; held minute-hand, disturbed clock's economy. So next morning, masters boys came trooping prayers, entered quadrangle, injured minute-hand indicating three minutes hour. They pulled up, took time. When hour struck, doors closed, half school late. Thomas set make inquiry, discovers names minute-hand, reports accordingly; sent for, knot friends making derisive pantomimic allusions fate walk off. But Doctor, hearing story, make much it, gives thirty lines Homer learn heart, lecture likelihood exploits ending broken bones. Alas! almost next day one great fairs town; several rows disagreeable accidents late taken place occasions, Doctor gives out, prayers morning, boy go town. Wherefore East Tom, earthly pleasure except told do, start away, second lesson, making short circuit fields, strike back lane leads town, go it, run plump upon one masters emerge High Street. The master question, though clever, righteous man. He already caught several pupils, gives lines learn, sends East Tom, pupils, Doctor, who, learning prayers morning, flogs soundly. The flogging good time, injustice captor rankling minds; end half, next evening one Thomas knocks door, says Doctor wants see them. They look one another silent dismay. What now? Which countless wrong-doings heard officially? However, use delaying, go study. There find Doctor, angry, graver. “He sent speak seriously go home. They flogged several times half-year direct wilful breaches rules. This cannot go on. They good others, getting School, influence. They seem think rules made capriciously, pleasure masters; so. They made good whole School, must shall obeyed. Those thoughtlessly wilfully break allowed stay School. He sorry leave, School might much good, wishes think seriously holidays said. Good-night.” And two hurry horribly scared; idea leave never crossed minds, quite unbearable. As go out, meet door old Holmes, sturdy, cheery praepostor another house, goes Doctor; hear genial, hearty greeting newcomer, different reception, door closes, return study heavy hearts, tremendous resolves break rules. Five minutes afterwards master form--a late arrival model young master--knocks Doctor's study-door. “Come in!” And enters, Doctor goes on, Holmes--“You see, I know anything case officially, I take notice all, I must publicly expel boy. I wish that, I think good him. There nothing good sound thrashing.” He paused shake hands master, Holmes also, prepares leave. “I understand. Good-night, sir.” “Good-night, Holmes. And remember,” added Doctor, emphasizing words, “a good sound thrashing whole house.” The door closed Holmes; Doctor, answer puzzled look lieutenant, explained shortly. “A gross case bullying. Wharton, head house, good fellow, slight weak, severe physical pain way deal case; I asked Holmes take up. He careful trustworthy, plenty strength. I wish sixth much. We must here, keep order all.” Now I want wiseacres read book, should, course prick long ears, howl, rather bray, story. Very good--I object; I add boys this, Holmes called levy house breakfast next morning, made speech case bullying question, gave bully “good sound thrashing;” years afterwards, boy sought Holmes, thanked him, saying kindest act ever done upon him, turning-point character; good fellow became, credit School. After talk them, Doctor said, “I want speak two boys form, East Brown. I speaking them. What think them?” “Well, hard workers, thoughtless full spirits; I cannot help liking them. I think sound, good fellows bottom.” “I glad it. I think too: But make uneasy. They taking lead good deal amongst fags house, active, bold fellows. I sorry lose them, I shall let stay I see gaining character manliness. In another year may great harm younger boys.” “Oh, I hope send away,” pleaded master. “Not I help it. But I never feel sure, half-holiday, I shall flog one next morning, foolish, thoughtless scrape. I quite dread seeing either them.” They silent minute. Presently Doctor began again:-- “They feel duty work school, one make feel it?” “I think either little boy take care of, would steady them. Brown reckless two, I say. East would get many scrapes without him.” “Well,” said Doctor, something like sigh, “I think it.” And went talk subjects. PART II. “I [hold] truth, sings, To one clear harp divers tones, That men may rise stepping-stones Of dead selves higher things.” --TENNYSON. CHAPTER I--HOW THE TIDE TURNED. “Once every man nation comes moment decide, In strife Truth Falsehood, good evil side. . . . . Then brave man chooses, coward stands aside, Doubting abject spirit, till Lord crucified.” --LOWELL. The turning-point hero's school career come, manner follows. On evening first day next half-year, Tom, East, another School-house boy, dropped Spread Eagle old Regulator, rushed matron's room high spirits, real boys first get back, however fond may home. “Well, Mrs. Wixie,” shouted one, seizing methodical, active, little dark-eyed woman, busy stowing away linen boys already arrived several pigeon-holes, “here again, see, jolly ever. Let us help put things away.” “And, Mary,” cried another (she called indifferently either name), “who come back? Has Doctor made old Jones leave? How many new boys there?” “Am I East Gray's study? You know promised get us could,” shouted Tom. “And I sleep Number 4?” roared East. “How old Sam, Bogle, Sally?” “Bless boys!” cries Mary, last getting word; “why, shake death. There, now, go away housekeeper's room get suppers; know I time talk. You find plenty house.--Now, Master East, let things alone. You mixing three new boys' things.” And rushed East, escaped round open trunks holding prize. “Hullo! look here, Tommy,” shouted he; “here fun!” brandished head pretty little night-caps, beautifully made marked, work loving fingers distant country home. The kind mother sisters sewed delicate stitching aching hearts little thought trouble might bringing young head meant. The little matron wiser, snatched caps East could look name them. “Now, Master East, I shall angry go,” said she; “there capital cold beef pickles upstairs, I old boys room first night.” “Hurrah pickles! Come along, Tommy--come along, Smith. We shall find young count is, I bound. I hope sleep room. Mary's always vicious first week.” As boys turned leave room, matron touched Tom's arm, said, “Master Brown, please stop minute; I want speak you.” “Very well, Mary. I come minute, East. Do finish pickles.” “O Master Brown,” went little matron, rest gone, “you Gray's study, Mrs. Arnold says. And wants take young gentleman. He new boy, thirteen years old though look it. He delicate, never home before. And I told Mrs. Arnold I thought would kind him, see bully first. He put form, I given bed next Number 4; East cannot sleep half.” Tom rather put speech. He got double study coveted, conditions attached greatly moderated joy. He looked across room, far corner sofa aware slight, pale boy, large blue eyes light fair hair, seemed ready shrink floor. He saw glance little stranger boy whose first half-year public school would misery left alone, constant anxiety one meant see troubles. Tom honest take youngster, let shift himself; took chum instead East, pet plans bottled-beer cellar window, making night-lines slings, plotting expeditions Brownsover Mills Caldecott's Spinney? East made minds get study, every night locking-up till ten would together talk fishing, drink bottled-beer, read Marryat's novels, sort birds' eggs. And new boy would likely never go close, would afraid wet feet, always getting laughed at, called Molly, Jenny, derogatory feminine nickname. The matron watched moment, saw passing mind, so, like wise negotiator, threw appeal warm heart. “Poor little fellow,” said she, almost whisper; “his father's dead, got brothers. And mamma--such kind, sweet lady--almost broke heart leaving morning; said one sisters like die decline, so--” “Well, well,” burst Tom, something like sigh effort, “I suppose I must give East.--Come along, young un. What name? We go supper, I show study.” “His name's George Arthur,” said matron, walking Tom, grasped little delicate hand proper preliminary making chum him, felt could blown away. “I books things put study, mamma new papered, sofa covered, new green-baize curtains door” (the diplomatic matron threw in, show new boy contributing largely partnership comforts). “And Mrs. Arnold told say,” added, “that like come tea her. You know way, Master Brown, things gone up, I know.” Here announcement Master Tom! He go tea first night, sixth fifth form boy, importance School world, instead reckless young scapegrace amongst fags. He felt lifted higher social moral platform once. Nevertheless could give without sigh idea jolly supper housekeeper's room East rest, rush round studies friends afterwards, pour deeds wonders holidays, plot fifty plans coming half-year, gather news left new boys come, got study, new praepostors slept. However, Tom consoled thinking could done new boy heels, marched along passages Doctor's private house young charge tow, monstrous good-humour world. It needless, would impertinent, tell two young boys received drawing-room. The lady presided still living, carried peaceful home north respect love ever felt shared gentle high-bred hospitality. Ay, many brave heart, work bearing load country curacies, London chambers, Indian sun, Australian towns clearings, looks back fond grateful memory School-house drawing-room, dates much highest best training lessons learnt there. Besides Mrs. Arnold one two elder children, one younger masters, young Brooke (who sixth, succeeded brother's position influence), another sixth-form boy, talking together fire. The master young Brooke, great strapping fellow six feet high, eighteen years old, powerful coal-heaver, nodded kindly Tom, intense glory, went talking. The notice them. The hostess, kind words, led boys insensibly feel ease begin talking one another, left children finished letter. The young ones got fast well, Tom holding forth prodigious pony riding hunting, hearing stories winter glories lakes, tea came in, immediately Doctor himself. How frank, kind, manly greeting party fire! It Tom's heart good see young Brooke shake hands, look one another face; fail remark Brooke nearly tall quite broad Doctor. And cup full another moment master turned another warm shake hand, and, seemingly oblivious late scrapes getting into, said, “Ah, Brown, here! I hope left father well home?” “Yes, sir, quite well.” “And little fellow share study. Well, look like see him. He wants Rugby air, cricket. And must take good long walks, Bilton Grange, Caldecott's Spinney, show little pretty country here.” Tom wondered Doctor knew visits Bilton Grange purpose taking rooks' nests (a proceeding strongly discountenanced owner thereof), Caldecott's Spinney prompted chiefly conveniences setting night-lines. What Doctor know? And noble use always made it! He almost resolved abjure rook-pies night-lines ever. The tea went merrily off, Doctor talking holiday doings, prospects half-year--what chance Balliol scholarship, whether eleven would good one. Everybody ease, everybody felt he, young might be, use little School world, work there. Soon tea Doctor went study, young boys minutes afterwards took leave went private door led Doctor's house middle passage. At fire, farther end passage, crowd boys loud talk laughter. There sudden pause door opened, great shout greeting, Tom recognized marching passage. “Hullo, Brown! come from?” “Oh, I tea Doctor,” says Tom, great dignity. “My eye!” cried East, “Oh! Mary called back, come supper. You lost something. That beef pickles end good.” “I say, young fellow,” cried Hall, detecting Arthur catching collar, “what name? Where come from? How old you?” Tom saw Arthur shrink back look scared group turned him, thought best let answer, standing side support case need. “Arthur, sir. I come Devonshire.” “Do call 'sir,' young muff. How old you?” “Thirteen.” “Can sing?” The poor boy trembling hesitating. Tom struck in--“You hanged, Tadpole. He sing, whether not, Saturday twelve weeks, long enough yet.” “Do know home, Brown?” “No; chum Gray's old study, near prayer-time, I look yet.--Come along, Arthur.” Away went two, Tom longing get charge safe cover, might advise deportment. “What queer chum Tom Brown,” comment fire; must confessed thought Tom himself, lighted candle, surveyed new green-baize curtains carpet sofa much satisfaction. “I say, Arthur, brick mother make us cozy! But look now; must answer straight fellows speak you, afraid. If afraid, get bullied. And say sing; ever talk home, mother sisters.” Poor little Arthur looked ready cry. “But, please,” said he, “may I talk about--about home you?” “Oh yes; I like it. But talk boys know, call home-sick, mamma's darling, stuff. What jolly desk! Is yours? And stunning binding! Why, school-books look like novels.” And Tom soon deep Arthur's goods chattels, new, good enough fifth-form boy, hardly thought friends outside till prayer-bell rang. I already described School-house prayers. They first night nights, save gaps caused absence boys came late, line new boys stood together farther table--of sorts sizes, like young bears troubles come, Tom's father said position. He thought looked line, poor little slight Arthur standing them, leading upstairs Number 4, directly prayers, showing bed. It huge, high, airy room, two large windows looking School close. There twelve beds room. The one farthest corner fireplace, occupied sixth-form boy, responsible discipline room, rest boys lower-fifth junior forms, fags (for fifth-form boys, said, slept rooms themselves). Being fags, eldest sixteen years old, bound bed ten. The sixth-form boys came bed ten quarter-past (at time old verger came round put candles out), except sat read. Within minutes therefore entry, boys slept Number 4 come up. The little fellows went quietly beds, began undressing, talking whispers; elder, amongst Tom, sat chatting one another's beds, jackets waistcoats off. Poor little Arthur overwhelmed novelty position. The idea sleeping room strange boys clearly never crossed mind before, painful strange him. He could hardly bear take jacket off; however, presently, effort, came, paused looked Tom, sitting bottom bed talking laughing. “Please, Brown,” whispered, “may I wash face hands?” “Of course, like,” said Tom, staring; “that washhand-stand, window, second bed. You go water morning use all.” And went talk, Arthur stole timidly beds washhand-stand, began ablutions, thereby drawing moment attention room. On went talk laughter. Arthur finished washing undressing, put night-gown. He looked round nervously ever. Two three little boys already bed, sitting chins knees. The light burned clear, noise went on. It trying moment poor little lonely boy; however, time ask Tom might might do, dropped knees bedside, done every day childhood, open heart Him heareth cry beareth sorrows tender child, strong man agony. Tom sitting bottom bed unlacing boots, back towards Arthur, see happened, looked wonder sudden silence. Then two three boys laughed sneered, big, brutal fellow standing middle room picked slipper, shied kneeling boy, calling snivelling young shaver. Then Tom saw whole, next moment boot pulled flew straight head bully, time throw arm catch elbow. “Confound you, Brown! for?” roared he, stamping pain. “Never mind I mean,” said Tom, stepping floor, every drop blood body tingling; “if fellow wants boot, knows get it.” What would result doubtful, moment sixth-form boy came in, another word could said. Tom rest rushed bed finished unrobing there, old verger, punctual clock, put candle another minute, toddled next room, shutting door usual “Good-night, gen'lm'n.” There many boys room little scene taken heart slept. But sleep seemed deserted pillow poor Tom. For time excitement, flood memories chased one another brain, kept thinking resolving. His head throbbed, heart leapt, could hardly keep springing bed rushing room. Then thought mother came across him, promise made knee, years ago, never forget kneel bedside, give Father, laid head pillow, might never rise; lay gently, cried heart would break. He fourteen years old. It light act courage days, dear boys, little fellow say prayers publicly, even Rugby. A years later, Arnold's manly piety begun leaven School, tables turned; died, School-house least, I believe house, rule way. But poor Tom come school times. The first nights came kneel noise, sat bed till candle out, stole said prayers, fear lest one find out. So many another poor little fellow. Then began think might well say prayers bed, matter whether kneeling, sitting, lying down. And come pass Tom, confess Lord men; last year probably said prayers earnest dozen times. Poor Tom! first bitterest feeling like break heart sense cowardice. The vice others loathed brought burnt soul. He lied mother, conscience, God. How could bear it? And poor little weak boy, pitied almost scorned weakness, done he, braggart was, dared do. The first dawn comfort came swearing would stand boy thick thin, cheer him, help him, bear burdens good deed done night. Then resolved write home next day tell mother all, coward son been. And peace came resolved, lastly, bear testimony next morning. The morning would harder night begin with, felt could afford let one chance slip. Several times faltered, devil showed first old friends calling “Saint” “Square-toes,” dozen hard names, whispered motives would misunderstood, would left alone new boy; whereas duty keep means influence, might good largest number. And came subtle temptation, “Shall I showing braver others this? Have I right begin now? Ought I rather pray study, letting boys know I so, trying lead it, public least I go I done?” However, good angel strong night, turned side slept, tired trying reason, resolved follow impulse strong, found peace. Next morning washed dressed, jacket waistcoat, ten minutes' bell began ring, face whole room knelt pray. Not five words could say--the bell mocked him; listening every whisper room--what thinking him? He ashamed go kneeling, ashamed rise knees. At last, inmost heart, still, small voice seemed breathe forth words publican, “God merciful sinner!” He repeated over, clinging life, rose knees comforted humbled, ready face whole world. It needed: two boys besides Arthur already followed example, went great School glimmering another lesson heart--the lesson conquered coward spirit conquered whole outward world; one old prophet learnt cave Mount Horeb, hid face, still, small voice asked, “What doest thou here, Elijah?” however may fancy alone side good, King Lord men nowhere without His witnesses; every society, however seemingly corrupt godless, bowed knee Baal. He found, too, greatly exaggerated effect produced act. For nights sneer laugh knelt down, passed soon, one one boys three four followed lead. I fear measure owing fact Tom could probably thrashed boy room except praepostor; rate, every boy knew would try upon slight provocation, choose run risk hard fight Tom Brown taken fancy say prayers. Some small boys Number 4 communicated new state things chums, several rooms poor little fellows tried on--in one instance so, praepostor heard interfered decidedly, partial success; rest, short struggle, confessors bullied laughed down, old state things went time longer. Before either Tom Brown Arthur left School-house, room become regular custom. I trust still, old heathen state things gone ever. CHAPTER II--THE NEW BOY. “And Heaven's rich instincts grew As effortless woodland nooks Send violets paint blue.”--LOWELL. I mean recount little troubles annoyances thronged upon Tom beginning half-year, new character bear-leader gentle little boy straight home. He seemed become new boy again, without long-suffering meekness indispensable supporting character moderate success. From morning till night feeling responsibility mind, even left Arthur study close hour, never ease till sight again. He waited doors school every lesson every calling-over; watched tricks played him, none regulation questions asked; kept eye plate dinner breakfast, see unfair depredations made upon viands; short, East remarked, cackled like hen one chick. Arthur took long time thawing, too, made harder work; sadly timid; scarcely ever spoke unless Tom spoke first; and, worst all, would agree everything--the hardest thing world Brown bear. He got quite angry sometimes, sat together night study, provoking habit agreement, point breaking dozen times lecture upon propriety fellow speaking out, managed restrain thought might frighten Arthur, remembrance lesson learnt first night Number 4. Then would resolve sit still say word till Arthur began; always beat game, presently begin talking despair, fearing lest Arthur might think vexed something not, dog-tired sitting tongue-tied. It hard work. But Tom taken up, meant stick it, go satisfy himself; resolution much assisted chafing East old friends, began call “dry-nurse,” otherwise break small wit him. But took ground, every then, Tom sorely puzzled. “Tell what, Tommy,” East would say; “you spoil young Hopeful much coddling. Why cannot let go find level? He never worth button go keeping skirts.” “Well, fit fight way yet; I trying get every day, odd. Poor little beggar! I cannot make bit. He bit like anything I ever seen heard of--he seems nerves; anything say seems hurt like cut blow.” “That sort boy's use here,” said East; “he spoil. Now I tell do, Tommy. Go get nice large band-box made, put plenty cotton-wool pap-bottle, labelled 'With care--this side up,' send back mamma.” “I think I shall make hand though,” said Tom, smiling, “say will. There something him, every then, shows got pluck somewhere him. That thing wash, it, old Scud? But get bring out?” Tom took one hand breeches-pocket stuck back hair scratch, giving hat tilt nose, one method invoking wisdom. He stared ground ludicrously puzzled look, presently looked met East's eyes. That young gentleman slapped back, put arm round shoulder, strolled quadrangle together. “Tom,” said he, “blest best old fellow ever was. I like see go thing. Hang it, I wish I could take things do; I never get higher joke. Everything's joke. If I going flogged next minute, I blue funk, I could help laughing life me.” “Brown East, go fag Jones great fives court.” “Hullo, though, past joke,” broke East, springing young gentleman addressed them, catching collar.--“Here, Tommy, catch hold t'other side holla.” The youth seized, dragged, struggling, quadrangle School-house hall. He one miserable little pretty white-handed, curly-headed boys, petted pampered big fellows, wrote verses them, taught drink use bad language, could spoil everything * world next. One avocations young gentlemen took particular delight going getting fags protectors, heroes playing game. They carried pencil paper them, putting names boys sent, always sending five times many wanted, getting thrashed go. The present youth belonged house jealous School-house, always picked School-house fags could find them. However, time would got wrong sow ear. His captors slammed great door hall, East put back it, Tom gave prisoner shake up, took away list, stood floor, proceeded leisurely examine document. * A kind wise critic, old Rugboean, notes margin: “The small friend system utterly bad 1841-1847.” Before that, too, many noble friendships big little boys; I cannot strike passage. Many boys know left in. “Let out, let go!” screamed boy, furious passion. “I go tell Jones minute, give --- thrashing ever had.” “Pretty little dear,” said East, patting top hat.--“Hark swears, Tom. Nicely brought young man, he, I think.” “Let alone, --- you,” roared boy, foaming rage, kicking East, quietly tripped up, deposited floor place safety. “Gently, young fellow,” said he; “'tain't improving little whippersnappers like indulging blasphemy; stop that, get something like.” “I licked I get out, I will,” rejoined boy, beginning snivel. “Two play game, mind you,” said Tom, finished examination list. “Now listen here. We come across fives court, Jones four fags already--two wants. If would wanted us change, would stopped us himself. And here, little blackguard, got seven names list besides ours, five School-house.” Tom walked him, jerked legs; time whining like whipped puppy. “Now listen me. We going fag Jones. If tell sent us, us give thrashing remember.” And Tom tore list threw pieces fire. “And mind you, too,” said East, “do let catch sneaking School-house, picking fags. You got sort hide take sound licking kindly.” And opened door sent young gentleman flying quadrangle parting kick. “Nice boy, Tommy,” said East, shoving hands pockets, strolling fire. “Worst sort breed,” responded Tom, following example. “Thank goodness, big fellow ever took petting me.” “You would never like that,” said East. “I like put museum: Christian young gentleman, nineteenth century, highly educated. Stir long pole, Jack, hear swear like drunken sailor. He would make respectable public open eyes, I think.” “Think tell Jones?” said Tom. “No,” said East. “Do care does.” “Nor I,” said Tom. And went back talk Arthur. The young gentleman brains enough tell Jones, reasoning East Brown, noted toughest fags School, would care three straws licking Jones might give them, would likely keep words passing interest. After conversation, East came good deal study, took notice Arthur, soon allowed Tom thorough little gentleman, would get shyness good time; much comforted hero. He felt every day, too, value object life--something drew himself; dull time year, games going much cared, happier ever yet school, saying great deal. The time Tom allowed away charge locking-up till supper-time. During hour hour half used take fling, going round studies acquaintance, sparring gossiping hall, jumping old iron-bound tables, carving bit name them, joining chorus merry voices--in fact, blowing steam, call it. This process congenial temper, Arthur showed pleased arrangement, several weeks Tom ever study supper. One evening, however, rushed look old chisel, corks, article essential pursuit time being, rummaging cupboards, looked moment, caught figure poor little Arthur. The boy sitting elbows table, head leaning hands, open book, tears falling fast. Tom shut door once, sat sofa Arthur, putting arm round neck. “Why, young un, matter?” said kindly; “you unhappy, you?” “Oh no, Brown,” said little boy, looking great tears eyes; “you kind me, I happy.” “Why call Tom? Lots boys I like half much you. What reading, then? Hang it! must come me, mope yourself.” And Tom cast eyes book, saw Bible. He silent minute, thought himself, “Lesson Number 2, Tom Brown;” said gently, “I glad see this, Arthur, ashamed I read Bible myself. Do read every night supper I out?” “Yes.” “Well, I wish would wait till afterwards, would read together. But, Arthur, make cry?” “Oh, I unhappy. But home, father alive, always read lessons tea; I love read now, try remember said them. I cannot remember I think I scarcely understand great deal I remember. But comes back fresh I cannot help crying sometimes think I shall never read him.” Arthur never spoken home before, Tom encouraged so, blundering schoolboy reasoning made think Arthur would softened less manly thinking home. But fairly interested, forgot chisels bottled beer; little encouragement Arthur launched home history, prayer-bell put sadly rang call hall. From time Arthur constantly spoke home, all, father, dead year, whose memory Tom soon got love reverence almost much son did. Arthur's father clergyman parish Midland counties, risen large town war, upon hard years followed fallen fearful weight. The trade half ruined; came old, sad story, masters reducing establishments, men turned wandering about, hungry wan body, fierce soul, thought wives children starving home, last sticks furniture going pawnshop; children taken school, lounging dirty streets courts, listless almost play, squalid rags misery; fearful struggle employers men--lowerings wages, strikes, long course oft-repeated crime, ending every riot, fire, county yeomanry. There need dwell upon tales: Englishman whose soul sunk deep worthy name. You English boys, book meant (God bless bright faces kind hearts!), learn soon enough. Into parish state society Arthur's father thrown age twenty-five--a young married parson, full faith, hope, love. He battled like man, lots fine Utopian ideas perfectibility mankind, glorious humanity, such-like, knocked head, real, wholesome Christian love poor, struggling, sinning men, felt one, spent fortune, strength, life, driven heart. He battled like man, gotten man's reward--no silver tea-pots salvers, flowery inscriptions setting forth virtues appreciation genteel parish; fat living stall, never looked, care; sighs praises comfortable dowagers well-got-up young women, worked slippers, sugared tea, adored “a devoted man;” manly respect, wrung unwilling souls men fancied order natural enemies; fear hatred every one false unjust district, master man; blessed sight women children daily becoming human homely, comfort husbands fathers. These things, course, took time, fought toil sweat brain heart, life-blood poured out. All that, Arthur laid account give, took matter course, neither pitying himself, looking martyr, felt wear tear making feel old time, stifling air fever-dens telling health. His wife seconded everything. She rather fond society, much admired run marriage; London world belonged pitied poor Fanny Evelyn married young clergyman, went settle smoky hole Turley; nest Chartism Atheism, part country decent families leave years. However, somehow seem care. If husband's living amongst green fields near pleasant neighbours would liked better--that never pretended deny. But were. The air bad, all; people good sort people--civil civil them, first brush; expect work miracles, convert off-hand model Christians. So went quietly among folk, talking treating would done people rank. They feel anything common way, perfectly natural, none condescension consciousness manner outrages independent poor. And thus gradually respect confidence; sixteen years looked whole neighbourhood man, man masters men could go strikes, quarrels difficulties, right true word would said without fear favour. And women come round take advice, go friend troubles; children worshipped ground trod on. They three children, two daughters son, little Arthur, came sisters. He delicate boy childhood; thought tendency consumption, kept home taught father, made companion him, gained good scholarship, knowledge interest many subjects boys general never come across till many years older. Just reached thirteenth year, father settled strong enough go school, and, much debating himself, resolved send there, desperate typhus fever broke town. Most clergy, almost doctors, ran away; work fell tenfold weight stood work. Arthur wife caught fever, died days; recovered, able nurse end, store last words. He sensible last, calm happy, leaving wife children fearless trust years hands Lord Friend lived died him, he, best power, lived died. His widow's mourning deep gentle. She affected request committee freethinking club, established town factory hands (which striven might main, nearly suppressed), number might allowed help bear coffin, anything else. Two chosen, who, six labouring men, fellow-workmen friends, bore grave--a man fought Lord's fight even unto death. The shops closed factories shut day parish, yet master stopped day's wages; many year afterwards townsfolk felt want brave, hopeful, loving parson wife, lived teach mutual forbearance helpfulness, almost last given glimpse old world would people would live God instead themselves. What story? Well, dear boys, let fellow go way, get anything worth having. I must show sort man begotten trained little Arthur, else believe him, I resolved shall do; see he, timid, weak boy, points bravest strongest recoiled, made presence example felt first sides, unconsciously himself, without least attempt proselytizing. The spirit father him, Friend father left neglect trust. After supper night, almost nightly years afterwards, Tom Arthur, degrees East occasionally, sometimes one, sometimes another, friends, read chapter Bible together, talked afterwards. Tom first utterly astonished, almost shocked, sort way Arthur read book talked men women whose lives told. The first night happened fall chapters famine Egypt, Arthur began talking Joseph living statesman--just might talked Lord Grey Reform Bill, much living realities him. The book him, Tom saw, vivid delightful history real people, might right wrong, like one walking Rugby--the Doctor, masters, sixth-form boys. But astonishment soon passed off, scales seemed drop eyes, book became ever great human divine book, men women, looked upon something quite different himself, became friends counsellors. For purposes, however, history one night's reading sufficient, must told here, subject, though happen till year afterwards, long events recorded next chapter story. Arthur, Tom, East together one night, read story Naaman coming Elisha cured leprosy. When chapter finished, Tom shut Bible slap. “I cannot stand fellow Naaman,” said he, “after would seen felt, going back bowing house Rimmon, effeminate scoundrel master it. I wonder Elisha took trouble heal him. How must despised him!” “Yes; go usual, head,” struck East, always took opposite side Tom, half love argument, half conviction. “How know think better it? How know master scoundrel? His letter look like it, book say so.” “I care,” rejoined Tom; “why Naaman talk bowing down, then, mean it? He likely get earnest got back court, away prophet.” “Well, but, Tom,” said Arthur, “look Elisha says him--'Go peace.' He would said Naaman wrong.” “I see means saying, 'You man I took for.'” “No, no; all,” said East. “Read words fairly, take men find them. I like Naaman, think fine fellow.” “I not,” said Tom positively. “Well, I think East right,” said Arthur; “I cannot see right best can, though may best absolutely. Every man born martyr.” “Of course, course,” said East; “but one pet hobbies.--How often I told you, Tom, must drive nail go.” “And often I told you,” rejoined Tom, “that always go want, stick hit hard enough. I hate half-measures compromises.” “Yes, whole-hog man, Tom. Must whole animal-hair teeth, claws tail,” laughed East. “Sooner bread day half loaf.” “I know;” said Arthur--“it rather puzzling; right things got proper compromises--I mean principle given up?” “That point,” said Tom; “I object compromise, give principle.” “Not you,” said East laughingly.--“I know old, Arthur, find day. There reasonable fellow world, hear talk. He never wants anything right fair; come settle right fair, everything wants, nothing want. And idea compromise. Give Brown compromise I side.” “Now, Harry,” said Tom, “no chaff. I serious. Look here. This makes blood tingle.” And turned pages Bible read, “Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego answered said king, O Nebuchadnezzar, careful answer thee matter. If so, God serve able deliver us burning fiery furnace, deliver us thine hand, O king. But not, known unto thee, O king, serve thy gods, worship golden image thou hast set up.” He read last verse twice, emphasizing nots, dwelling gave actual pleasure, hard part with. They silent minute, Arthur said, “Yes, glorious story, prove point, Tom, I think. There times one way, highest, men found stand breach.” “There always highest way, always right one,” said Tom. “How many times Doctor told us sermons last year, I like know?” “Well, going convince us--is he, Arthur? No Brown compromise to-night,” said East, looking watch. “But past eight, must go first lesson. What bore!” So took books fell work; Arthur forget, thought long often conversation. CHAPTER III--ARTHUR MAKES A FRIEND. “Let Nature teacher: Sweet lore Nature brings. Our meddling intellect Misshapes beauteous forms things. We murder dissect. Enough Science Art: Close barren leaves; Come forth, bring heart That watches receives.”--WORDSWORTH. About six weeks beginning half, Tom Arthur sitting one night supper beginning verses, Arthur suddenly stopped, looked up, said, “Tom, know anything Martin?” “Yes,” said Tom, taking hand back hair, delighted throw Gradus ad Parnassum sofa; “I know pretty well. He good fellow, mad hatter. He called Madman, know. And never fellow getting sorts rum things him. He tamed two snakes last half, used carry pocket; I bound got hedgehogs rats cupboard now, one knows besides.” “I like much know him,” said Arthur; “he next form to-day, would lost book looked mine, seemed kind gentle I liked much.” “Ah, poor old Madman, always losing books,” said Tom, “and getting called floored got them.” “I like better,” said Arthur. “Well, great fun, I tell you,” said Tom, throwing back sofa, chuckling remembrance. “We game one day last half. He kicking horrid stinks time study, till I suppose fellow told Mary, told Doctor. Anyhow, one day little dinner, came library, Doctor, instead going home, came striding hall. East I five six fellows fire, preciously stared, come like year, unless wet day fight hall. 'East,' says he, 'just come show Martin's study.' 'Oh, game,' whispered rest us; cut upstairs Doctor, East leading. As got New Row, hardly wide enough hold Doctor gown, click, click, click, heard old Madman's den. Then stopped sudden, bolts went like fun. The Madman knew East's step, thought going siege. “'It Doctor, Martin. He wants see you,' sings East. “Then bolts went back slowly, door opened, old Madman standing, looking precious scared--his jacket off, shirt-sleeves elbows, long skinny arms covered anchors arrows letters, tattooed gunpowder like sailor-boy's, stink fit knock coming out. It Was Doctor could stand ground, East I, looking arms, held noses tight. The old magpie standing window-sill, feathers drooping, looking disgusted half-poisoned. “'What about, Martin?' says Doctor. 'You really must go way; nuisance whole passage.' “'Please, sir, I mixing powder; harm it. And Madman seized nervously pestle mortar, show Doctor harmlessness pursuits, went pounding--click, click, click. He given six clicks before, puff! went whole great blaze, away went pestle mortar across study, back tumbled passage. The magpie fluttered court, swearing, Madman danced out, howling, fingers mouth. The Doctor caught hold him, called us fetch water. 'There, silly fellow,' said he, quite pleased, though, find much hurt, 'you see know least things; now, mind, must give practising chemistry yourself.' Then took hold arm looked it, I saw bite lip, eyes twinkled; said, quite grave, 'Here, see, making foolish marks yourself, never get out, sorry year two. Now come housekeeper's room, let us see hurt.' And away went two, stayed regular turn-out den, till Martin came back hand bandaged turned us out. However, I go see after, tell come prayers supper.” And away went Tom find boy question, dwelt little study himself, New Row. The aforesaid Martin, Arthur taken fancy for, one unfortunates time day (and are, I fear, still) quite places public school. If knew use boys, Martin would seized upon educated natural philosopher. He passion birds, beasts, insects, knew habits one Rugby--except perhaps Doctor, knew everything. He also experimental chemist small scale, made unto electric machine, greatest pleasure glory administer small shocks small boys rash enough venture study. And means adventure free excitement; besides probability snake dropping head twining lovingly leg, rat getting breeches-pocket search food, animal chemical odour faced, always hung den, chance blown many experiments Martin always trying, wondrous results shape explosions smells mortal boy ever heard of. Of course, poor Martin, consequence pursuits, become Ishmaelite house. In first place, half-poisoned neighbours, turn always lookout pounce upon numerous live-stock, drive frantic enticing pet old magpie window neighbouring study, making disreputable old bird drunk toast soaked beer sugar. Then Martin, sins, inhabited study looking small court ten feet across, window completely commanded studies opposite Sick-room Row, latter slightly higher elevation. East, another boy equally tormenting ingenious turn mind, lived exactly opposite, expended huge pains time preparation instruments annoyance behoof Martin live colony. One morning old basket made appearance, suspended short cord outside Martin's window, deposited amateur nest containing four young hungry jackdaws, pride glory Martin's life, time being, currently asserted hatched upon person. Early morning late night seen half window, administering varied wants callow brood. After deep cogitation, East chum spliced knife end fishing-rod; watched Martin out, had, half hour's severe sawing, cut string basket suspended, tumbled pavement below, hideous remonstrance occupants. Poor Martin, returning short absence, collected fragments replaced brood (except one whose neck broken descent) old location, suspending time string wire twisted together, defiant sharp instrument persecutors could command. But, like Russian engineers Sebastopol, East chum answer every move adversary, next day mounted gun shape pea-shooter upon ledge window, trained bear exactly upon spot Martin occupy tending nurslings. The moment began feed began shoot. In vain enemy invest pea-shooter, endeavour answer fire fed young birds hand; attention divided, shots flew wild, every one told face hands, drove howlings imprecations. He driven ensconce nest corner already too-well-filled den. His door barricaded set ingenious bolts invention, sieges frequent neighbours unusually ambrosial odour spread den neighbouring studies. The door panels normal state smash, frame door resisted besiegers, behind owner carried varied pursuits--much state mind, I fancy, border-farmer lived in, days moss-troopers, hold might summoned cattle carried minute night day. “Open, Martin, old boy; I, Tom Brown.” “Oh, well; stop moment.” One bolt went back. “You sure East there?” “No, no; hang it, open.” Tom gave kick, bolt creaked, entered den. Den indeed was--about five feet six inches long five wide, seven feet high. About six tattered school-books, chemical books, Taxidermy, Stanley Birds, odd volume Bewick, latter much better preservation, occupied top shelves. The shelves, cut away used owner purposes, fitted abiding-places birds, beasts, reptiles. There attempt carpet curtain. The table entirely occupied great work Martin, electric machine, covered carefully remains table-cloth. The jackdaw cage occupied one wall; adorned small hatchet, pair climbing irons, tin candle-box, time endeavouring raise hopeful young family field-mice. As nothing let lie useless, well candle-box thus occupied, candles Martin never had. A pound issued weekly, boys; candles available capital, easily exchangeable birds' eggs young birds, Martin's pound invariably found way hours Howlett's bird-fancier's, Bilton road, would give hawk's nightingale's egg young linnet exchange. Martin's ingenuity therefore ever rack supply light. Just hit upon grand invention, den lighted flaring cotton wick issuing ginger-beer bottle full doleful composition. When light altogether failed him, Martin would loaf fires passages hall, manner Diggs, try verses learn lines firelight. “Well, old boy, got sweeter den half. How stuff bottle stinks! Never mind; I going stop; come prayers study. You know young Arthur. We got Gray's study. We good supper talk bird-nesting.” Martin evidently highly pleased invitation, promised without fail. As soon prayers over, sixth fifth form boys withdrawn aristocratic seclusion room, rest, democracy, sat supper hall, Tom Arthur, secured allowances bread cheese, started feet catch eye praepostor week, remained charge supper, walking hall. He happened easy-going fellow, got pleasant nod “Please may I go out?” away scrambled prepare Martin sumptuous banquet. This Tom insisted on, great delight occasion, reason delight must expounded. The fact first attempt friendship Arthur made, Tom hailed grand step. The ease became hail-fellow-well-met anybody, blundered twenty friendships half-year, made sometimes sorry sometimes angry Arthur's reserve loneliness. True, Arthur always pleasant, even jolly, boys came Tom study; Tom felt him, were, chum associated others, Arthur would dwelling wilderness. This increased consciousness responsibility; though reasoned made clear yet somehow knew responsibility, trust taken without thinking it, head heels fact, centre turning-point school-life, make mar him, appointed work trial time being. And Tom becoming new boy, though frequent tumbles dirt perpetual hard battle himself, daily growing manfulness thoughtfulness, every high-couraged well-principled boy must, finds first time consciously grips self devil. Already could turn almost without sigh School-gates, scampered East three four others particular set, bound jolly lark quite according law, involving probably row louts, keepers, farm-labourers, skipping dinner calling-over, Phoebe Jennings's beer, possible flogging end relish. He quite got stage would grumble himself--“Well, hang it, hard Doctor saddled Arthur. Why could chummed Fogey, Thomkin, fellows never anything walk round close, finish copies first day set?” But although past, longed, felt right longing, time legitimate pastimes cricket, fives, bathing, fishing, within bounds, Arthur could yet companion; felt “young un” (as generally called him) found pursuit friend himself, able give time education body clear conscience. And wished come pass; almost hailed special providence (as indeed was, reasons gave it--what providences are?) Arthur singled Martin fellows friend. “The old Madman fellow,” thought he; “he take scrambling half country birds' eggs flowers, make run swim climb like Indian, teach word anything bad, keep lessons. What luck!” And so, usual heartiness, dived cupboard, hauled old knuckle-bone ham, two three bottles beer, together solemn pewter used state occasions; Arthur, equally elated easy accomplishment first act volition joint establishment, produced side bottle pickles pot jam, cleared table. In minute two noise boys coming supper heard, Martin knocked admitted, bearing bread cheese; three fell hearty good-will upon viands, talking faster ate, shyness disappeared moment Tom's bottled-beer hospitable ways. “Here Arthur, regular young town-mouse, natural taste woods, Martin, longing break neck climbing trees, passion young snakes.” “Well, I say,” sputtered Martin eagerly, “will come to-morrow, you, Caldecott's Spinney then? I know kestrel's nest, fir-tree. I cannot get without help; and, Brown, climb one.” “Oh yes, let us go,” said Arthur; “I never saw hawk's nest hawk's egg.” “You come study, then, I show five sorts,” said Martin. “Ay, old Madman got best collection house, out,” said Tom; Martin, warming unaccustomed good cheer chance convert, launched proposed bird-nesting campaign, betraying manner important secrets--a golden-crested wren's nest near Butlin's Mound, moor-hen sitting nine eggs pond Barby road, kingfisher's nest corner old canal Brownsover Mill. He heard, said, one ever got kingfisher's nest perfect, British Museum, Government, somebody, offered 100 pounds one could bring nest eggs damaged. In middle astounding announcement, others listening open ears, already considering application 100 pounds, knock came door, East's voice heard craving admittance. “There Harry,” said Tom; “we let in. I keep steady, Martin. I thought old boy would smell supper.” The fact was, Tom's heart already smitten asking fidus Achates feast, although extempore affair; though prudence desire get Martin Arthur together alone first overcome scruples, heartily glad open door, broach another bottle beer, hand old ham-knuckle searching old friend's pocket-knife. “Ah, greedy vagabonds,” said East, mouth full, “I knew something going I saw cut hall quick suppers. What stunning tap, Tom! You wunner bottling swipes.” “I practice enough sixth time, hard I picked wrinkle two benefit.” “Well, old Madman, goes bird-nesting campaign? How Howlett? I expect young rooks'll another fortnight, turn comes.” “There young rooks fit pies month yet; shows much know it,” rejoined Martin, who, though good friends East, regarded considerable suspicion propensity practical jokes. “Scud knows nothing cares nothing grub mischief,” said Tom; “but young rook pie, specially climb them, pretty eating.--However, I say, Scud, going hawk's nest to-morrow, Caldecott's Spinney; come behave yourself, stunning climb.” “And bathe Aganippe. Hooray! I man.” “No, no; bathing Aganippe; betters go.” “Well, well, never mind. I hawk's nest, anything turns up.” And bottled-beer finished, hunger appeased, East departed study, “that sneak Jones,” informed them, got sixth, occupied next study, instituted nightly visitation upon East chum, small discomfort. When gone Martin rose follow, Tom stopped him. “No one goes near New Row,” said he, “so may well stop verses, talk. We end quiet. Besides, praepostor comes now. We visited half.” So table cleared, cloth restored, three fell work Gradus dictionary upon morning's vulgus. They three fair examples way tasks done Rugby, consulship Plancus. And doubtless method little changed, nothing new sun, especially schools. Now known unto boys schools rejoice time-honoured institution vulgus (commonly supposed established William Wykeham Winchester, imported Rugby Arnold sake lines learnt heart intrinsic value, I always understood), short exercise Greek Latin verse, given subject, minimum number lines fixed form. The master form gave fourth lesson previous day subject next morning's vulgus, first lesson boy bring vulgus ready looked over; vulgus, certain number lines one Latin Greek poets construed form got heart. The master first lesson called boy form order, put lines. If could say them, seem say them, reading master's boy's book stood near, sent back, went boys say seem say them; either case vulgus looked master, gave entered book, credit discredit boy, many marks composition merited. At Rugby vulgus lines first lesson every day week, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays; thirty-eight weeks school year, obvious meanest capacity master form set one hundred fourteen subjects every year, two hundred twenty-eight every two years, on. Now, persons moderate invention considerable task, human nature prone repeat itself, wondered masters gave subjects sometimes certain lapse time. To meet rebuke bad habit masters, schoolboy mind, accustomed ingenuity, invented elaborate system tradition. Almost every boy kept vulgus written book, books duly handed boy boy, till (if tradition gone till now) I suppose popular boys, whose hands bequeathed vulgus-books accumulated, prepared three four vulguses subject heaven earth, “more worlds one,” unfortunate master pitch upon. At rate, lucky fellows generally one one friend time. The objection traditionary method vulguses risk successions might become confused, another follower traditions show identical vulgus fine morning; case, happened, considerable grief result. But risk hinder boys men short cuts pleasant paths? Now study night Tom upholder traditionary method vulgus doing. He carefully produced two large vulgus-books, began diving them, picking line here, ending (tags, vulgarly called), till gotten thought could make fit. He proceeded patch tags together help Gradus, producing incongruous feeble result eight elegiac lines, minimum quantity form, finishing two highly moral lines extra, making ten all, cribbed entire one books, beginning “O genus humanum,” must used dozen times before, whenever unfortunate wicked hero, whatever nation language sun, subject. Indeed began great doubts whether master would remember them, throw extra lines, case would call attention tags, detected, extra lines, would sent back place, passed muster would get marks them. The second method, pursued Martin, may called dogged prosaic method. He, Tom, took pleasure task, old vulgus-books own, one's else, could follow traditionary method, too, Tom remarked, genius. Martin proceeded write eight lines English, matter-of-fact kind, first came head; convert these, line line, main force Gradus dictionary Latin would scan. This cared for--to produce eight lines false quantities concords: whether words apt, sense was, mattered nothing; article new, line beyond minimum followers dogged method ever produce. The third, artistic method, Arthur's. He considered first point character event subject could neatly brought within limits vulgus, trying always get idea eight lines, binding ten even twelve lines could this. He set work much possible without Gradus help, clothe idea appropriate Latin Greek, would satisfied till polished well aptest poetic words phrases could get at. A fourth method, indeed, used school, simple kind require comment. It may called vicarious method, obtained amongst big boys lazy bullying habits, consisted simply making clever boys could thrash whole vulgus them, construe afterwards; latter method encouraged, I strongly advise practise. Of others, find traditionary troublesome, unless steal vulguses whole (experto crede), artistic method pays best marks ways. The vulguses finished nine clock, Martin rejoiced measure abundance light, Gradus dictionary, conveniences almost unknown getting work, pressed Arthur come verses whenever liked, three boys went Martin's den, Arthur initiated lore birds' eggs, great delight. The exquisite colouring forms astonished charmed him, scarcely ever seen hen's egg ostrich's, time lugged away bed learned names least twenty sorts, dreamed glorious perils tree-climbing, found roc's egg island big Sinbad's, clouded like tit-lark's, blowing Martin nearly drowned yolk. CHAPTER IV--THE BIRD-FANCIERS. “I found gift fair-- I found wood-pigeons breed; But let plunder forbear, She would say barbarous deed.”--ROWE. “And now, lad, take five shilling, And advice future think; So Billy pouched willing, And got night disguised drink.”--MS. Ballad. The next morning, first lesson, Tom turned back lines, wait till second round; Martin Arthur said right, got school once. When Tom got ran breakfast Harrowell's missing, Stumps informed swallowed breakfasts gone together--where, could say. Tom hurried breakfast, went first Martin's study own; signs missing boys found. He felt half angry jealous Martin. Where could gone? He learnt second lesson East rest good temper, went quadrangle. About ten minutes school Martin Arthur arrived quadrangle breathless; catching sight him, Arthur rushed up, excitement, bright glow face. “O Tom, look here!” cried he, holding three moor-hen's eggs; “we Barby road, pool Martin told us last night, see got.” Tom would pleased, looked something find fault with. “Why, young un,” said he, “what after? You mean say wading?” The tone reproach made poor little Arthur shrink moment look piteous; Tom shrug shoulders turned anger Martin. “Well, I think, Madman, would muff let getting wet time day. You might done wading yourself.” “So I did, course; would come too, see nest. We left six eggs in. They hatched day two.” “Hang eggs!” said Tom; “a fellow cannot turn back moment work's undone. He laid week precious lark, I bound.” “Indeed, Tom, now,” pleaded Arthur, “my feet wet, Martin made take shoes stockings trousers.” “But wet, dirty too; cannot I see?” answered Tom; “and called floored master sees state in. You looked second lesson, know.” O Tom, old humbug! upbraiding one learning lessons! If floored first lesson, mean say would them? And taken away poor little Arthur's joy pride first birds' eggs, goes puts study, takes books sigh, thinking done something horribly wrong, whereas learnt advance much done second lesson. But old Madman not, gets called up, makes frightful shots, losing ten places, getting floored. This somewhat appeases Tom's wrath, end lesson regained temper. And afterwards study begins get right again, watches Arthur's intense joy seeing Martin blowing eggs gluing carefully bits cardboard, notes anxious, loving looks little fellow casts sidelong him. And thinks, “What ill-tempered beast I am! Here I wishing last night come about, I spoiling all,” another five minutes swallowed last mouthful bile, repaid seeing little sensitive plant expand sun smiles. After dinner Madman busy preparations expedition, fitting new straps climbing-irons, filling large pill-boxes cotton-wool, sharpening East's small axe. They carry munitions calling-overs directly afterwards, dodged praepostors lookout fags cricket, four set smart trot Lawford footpath, straight Caldecott's Spinney hawk's nest. Martin leads way high feather; quite new sensation him, getting companions, finds pleasant, means show manner proofs science skill. Brown East may better cricket football games, thinks he, fields woods see I cannot teach something. He taken leadership already, strides away front climbing-irons strapped one arm, pecking-bag other, pockets hat full pill-boxes, cotton-wool, etceteras. Each others carries pecking-bag, East hatchet. When crossed three four fields without check, Arthur began lag; Tom seeing shouted Martin pull bit. “We hare-and-hounds. What good grinding rate?” “There Spinney,” said Martin, pulling brow slope bottom lay Lawford brook, pointing top opposite slope; “the nest one high fir-trees end. And brook I know sedge-bird's nest. We go look coming back.” “Oh, come on, let us stop,” said Arthur, getting excited sight wood. So broke trot again, soon across brook, slope, Spinney. Here advanced noiselessly possible, lest keepers enemies about, stopped foot tall fir, top Martin pointed pride kestrel's nest, object quest. “Oh, where? it?” asks Arthur, gaping air, vague idea would like. “There, see?” said East, pointing lump mistletoe next tree, beech. He saw Martin Tom busy climbing-irons, could resist temptation hoaxing. Arthur stared wondered ever. “Well, curious! It look bit like I expected,” said he. “Very odd birds, kestrels,” said East, looking waggishly victim, still star-gazing. “But I thought fir-tree?” objected Arthur. “Ah, know? That new sort fir old Caldecott brought Himalayas.” “Really!” said Arthur; “I glad I know that. How unlike firs are! They well here, they? The Spinney's full them.” “What humbug telling you?” cried Tom, looking up, caught word Himalayas, suspecting East after. “Only fir,” said Arthur, putting hand stem beech. “Fir!” shouted Tom; “why, mean say, young un, know beech see one?” Poor little Arthur looked terribly ashamed, East exploded laughter made wood ring. “I hardly ever seen trees,” faltered Arthur. “What shame hoax him, Scud!” cried Martin.--“Never mind, Arthur; shall know trees week two.” “And kestrel's nest, then?” asked Arthur. “That! Why, piece mistletoe. There nest, lump sticks fir.” “Do believe him, Arthur,” struck incorrigible East; “I saw old magpie go it.” Martin deign reply sally, except grunt, buckled last buckle climbing-irons, Arthur looked reproachfully East without speaking. But came tug war. It difficult tree climb branches reached, first fourteen feet up, trunk large bottom swarmed; fact, neither boys could reach half round arms. Martin Tom, irons on, tried without success first; fir bark broke away stuck irons soon leant weight feet, grip arms enough keep up; so, getting three four feet, came slithering ground, barking arms faces. They furious, East sat laughing shouting failure, “Two one old magpie!” “We must try pyramid,” said Tom last. “Now, Scud, lazy rascal, stick tree!” “I dare say! standing shoulders irons on. What think skin's made of?” However, got, leant tree, putting head clasping arms far could. “Now then, Madman,” said Tom, “you next.” “No, I lighter you; go next.” So Tom got East's shoulders, grasped tree above, Martin scrambled Tom's shoulders, amidst totterings groanings pyramid, and, spring sent supporters howling ground, clasped stem ten feet up, remained clinging. For moment two thought could get up; then, holding arms teeth, worked first one iron firmly bark, got another grip arms, another minute hold lowest branch. “All old magpie now,” said East; minute's rest, went Martin, hand hand, watched Arthur fearful eagerness. “Is dangerous?” said he. “Not bit,” answered Tom; “you cannot hurt get good hand-hold. Try every branch good pull trust it, go.” Martin amongst small branches close nest, away dashed old bird, soared trees, watching intruder. “All right--four eggs!” shouted he. “Take all!” shouted East; “that one a-piece.” “No, no; leave one, care,” said Tom. We boys idea birds could count, quite content long left one egg. I hope so. Martin carefully put one egg boxes third mouth, place safety, came like lamplighter. All went well till within ten feet ground, when, trunk enlarged, hold got less less firm, last came run, tumbling back turf, spluttering spitting remains great egg, broken jar fall. “Ugh, ugh! something drink--ugh! addled,” spluttered he, wood rang merry laughter East Tom. Then examined prizes, gathered things, went brook, Martin swallowed huge draughts water get rid taste; visited sedge-bird's nest, thence struck across country high glee, beating hedges brakes went along; Arthur last, intense delight, allowed climb small hedgerow oak magpie's nest Tom, kept round like mother, showed hold throw weight; though great fright, show it, applauded lissomness. They crossed road soon afterwards, there, close them, lay great heap charming pebbles. “Look here,” shouted East; “here luck! I longing good, honest pecking half-hour. Let us fill bags, foozling bird-nesting.” No one objected, boy filled fustian bag carried full stones. They crossed next field, Tom East taking one side hedges, two side. Noise enough made certainly, early season young birds, old birds strong wing young marksmen, flew shot first discharge. But great fun, rushing along hedgerows, discharging stone stone blackbirds chaffinches, though result shape slaughtered birds obtained; Arthur soon entered it, rushed head back birds, shouted, threw, tumbled ditches, hedges, wild Madman himself. Presently party, full cry old blackbird (who evidently used thing enjoyed fun, would wait till came close him, fly forty yards so, and, impudent flicker tail, dart depths quickset), came beating high double hedge, two side. “There again,” “Head him,” “Let drive,” “I there,” “Take care throwing, Madman.” The shouts might heard quarter mile off. They heard two hundred yards farmer two shepherds, doctoring sheep fold next field. Now, farmer question rented house yard situate end field young bird-fanciers arrived, house yard occupy keep one else in. Nevertheless, like brainless unreasoning Briton, persisted maintaining premises large stock cocks, hens, poultry. Of course, sorts depredators visited place time time: foxes gipsies wrought havoc night; daytime, I regret confess visits Rugby boys, consequent disappearances ancient respectable fowls unfrequent. Tom East period outlawry visited farm question felonious purposes, one occasion conquered slain duck there, borne away carcass triumphantly, hidden handkerchiefs. However, sickened practice trouble anxiety wretched duck's body caused them. They carried Sally Harrowell's, hopes good supper; she, examining it, made long face, refused dress anything it. Then took study, began plucking themselves; feathers, hide them? “Good gracious, Tom, lot feathers duck has!” groaned East, holding bagful hand, looking disconsolately carcass, yet half plucked. “And I think getting high, too, already,” said Tom, smelling cautiously, “so must finish soon.” “Yes, well; cook him? I sure I going try hall passages; cannot afford roasting ducks about--our character's bad.” “I wish rid brute,” said Tom, throwing table disgust. And day two became clear got rid must be; packed sealed brown paper, put cupboard unoccupied study, found holidays matron, gruesome body. They never duck-hunting since, others had, bold yeoman sore subject, bent making example first boys could catch. So shepherds crouched behind hurdles, watched party, approaching unconscious. Why old guinea-fowl lying hedge particular moment year? Who say? Guinea-fowls always are; things, animals, persons, requisite getting one scrapes--always ready mischief come them. At rate, East's nose popped old guinea-hen, scuttling along shrieking, “Come back, come back,” top voice. Either three might perhaps withstood temptation, East first let us drive stone hand her, rushes turn hedge again. He succeeds, dear life, hedge full cry, “Come back, come back,” getting shriller fainter every minute. Meantime, farmer men steal hurdles creep hedge towards scene action. They almost within stone's throw Martin, pressing unlucky chase hard, Tom catches sight them, sings out, “Louts, 'ware louts, side! Madman, look ahead!” catching hold Arthur, hurries away across field towards Rugby hard tear. Had himself, would stayed see others, heart sinks pluck goes. The idea led Doctor Arthur bagging fowls quite unmans takes half run him. However, boys able take care East Martin; dodge pursuers, slip gap, come pelting Tom Arthur, catch time. The farmer men making good running field behind. Tom wishes made direction, together, must see out. “You leave young un, you?” says he, haul poor little Arthur, already losing wind fright, next hedge. “Not we,” answer both. The next hedge stiff one; pursuers gain horribly them, pull Arthur through, two great rents trousers, foremost shepherd comes side. As start next field, aware two figures walking footpath middle it, recognize Holmes Diggs taking constitutional. Those good-natured fellows immediately shout, “On.” “Let us go surrender,” pants Tom. Agreed. And another minute four boys, great astonishment worthies, rush breathless Holmes Diggs, pull see matter; whole explained appearance farmer men, unite forces bear knot boys. There time explain, Tom's heart beats frightfully quick, ponders, “Will stand us?” The farmer makes rush East collars him; young gentleman, unusual discretion, instead kicking shins, looks appealingly Holmes, stands still. “Hullo there; fast,” says Holmes, bound stand till proved wrong. “Now about?” “I got young varmint last, I,” pants farmer; “why, a-skulking yard stealing fowls--that is; I doan't flogged it, every one them, name Thompson.” Holmes looks grave Diggs's face falls. They quite ready fight--no boys school so; praepostors, understand office, cannot uphold unrighteous causes. “I near old barn half,” cries East. “Nor I,” “Nor I,” chime Tom Martin. “Now, Willum, see last week?” “Ees, I seen sure enough,” says Willum, grasping prong carried, preparing action. The boys deny stoutly, Willum driven admit “if worn't chaps like two peas'n;” “leastways swear see'd two yard last Martinmas,” indicating East Tom. Holmes time meditate. “Now, sir,” says Willum, “you see cannot remember seen, I believe boys.” “I doan't care,” blusters farmer; “they arter fowls to-day--that enough I.--Willum, catch hold t'other chap. They a-sneaking two hours, I tells 'ee,” shouted he, Holmes stands Martin Willum, “and druv matter dozen young pullets pretty nigh death.” “Oh, whacker!” cried East; “we within hundred yards barn; ten minutes, seen nothing tough old guinea-hen, ran like greyhound.” “Indeed, true, Holmes, upon honour,” added Tom; “we fowls; guinea-hen ran hedge feet, seen nothing else.” “Drat talk. Thee catch hold t'other, Willum, come along wi' un.” “Farmer Thompson,” said Holmes, warning Willum prong stick, Diggs faced shepherd, cracking fingers like pistol-shots, “now listen reason. The boys fowls, plain.” “Tells 'ee I see'd'them. Who you, I like know?” “Never mind, farmer,” answered Holmes. “And I tell is: ought ashamed leaving poultry about, one watch it, near School. You deserve stolen. So choose come Doctor them, I shall go you, tell I think it.” The farmer began take Holmes master; besides, wanted get back flock. Corporal punishment question, odds great; began hint paying damage. Arthur jumped this, offering pay anything, farmer immediately valued guinea-hen half sovereign. “Half sovereign!” cried East, released farmer's grip; “well, good one! The old hen hurt bit, seven years old, I know, tough whipcord; could lay another egg save life.” It last settled pay farmer two shillings, man one shilling; matter ended, unspeakable relief Tom, able say word, sick heart idea Doctor would think him; whole party boys marched footpath towards Rugby. Holmes, one best boys School, began improve occasion. “Now, youngsters,” said he, marched along middle them, “mind this; well scrape. Do go near Thompson's barn again; hear?” Profuse promises all, especially East. “Mind, I ask questions,” went Mentor, “but I rather think chickens. Now, knocking people's chickens, running them, stealing. It nasty word, plain English it. If chickens dead lying shop, would take them, I know that, would apples Griffith's basket; real difference chickens running apples tree, articles shop. I wish morals sounder matters. There nothing mischievous school distinctions, jumble right wrong, justify things us poor boys would sent prison.” And good old Holmes delivered soul walk home many wise sayings, and, song says, “Gee'd sight good advice;” sermon sank all, less, penitent several hours. But truth compels admit East, rate, forgot week, remembered insult put upon Farmer Thompson, Tadpole hair-brained youngsters committed raid barn soon afterwards, caught shepherds severely handled, besides pay eight shillings--all money world--to escape taken Doctor. Martin became constant inmate joint study time, Arthur took kindly Tom could resist slight fits jealousy, which, however, managed keep himself. The kestrel's eggs broken, strange say, formed nucleus Arthur's collection, Martin worked heart soul, introduced Arthur Howlett bird-fancier, instructed rudiments art stuffing. In token gratitude, Arthur allowed Martin tattoo small anchor one wrists; decoration, however, carefully concealed Tom. Before end half-year trained bold climber good runner, and, Martin foretold, knew twice much trees, birds, flowers, many things, good-hearted facetious young friend Harry East. CHAPTER V--THE FIGHT: “Surgebat Macnevisius Et mox jactabat ultro, Pugnabo tua gratia Feroci hoc Mactwoltro.”--Etonian. There certain sort fellow--we used studying boys know well enough--of predicate almost positive certainty, month school, sure fight, almost equal certainty one. Tom Brown one these; well-weighed intention give full, true, correct account Tom's single combat school-fellow manner old friend Bell's Life, let young persons whose stomachs strong, think good set-to weapons God given us uncivilized, unchristian, ungentlemanly affair, skip chapter once, taste. It usual days two School-house boys fight. Of course exceptions, cross-grained, hard-headed fellow came would never happy unless quarrelling nearest neighbours, class-dispute, fifth form fags, instance, required blood-letting; champion picked side tacitly, settled matter good hearty mill. But, part, constant use surest keepers peace, boxing-gloves, kept School-house boys fighting one another. Two three nights every week gloves brought out, either hall fifth-form room; every boy ever likely fight knew neighbours' prowess perfectly well, could tell nicety chance would stand-up fight boy house. But, course, experience could gotten regarded boys houses; houses less jealous School-house, collisions frequent. After all, would life without fighting, I like know? From cradle grave, fighting, rightly understood, business, real highest, honestest business every son man. Every one worth salt enemies, must beaten, evil thoughts habits himself, spiritual wickednesses high places, Russians, Border-ruffians, Bill, Tom, Harry, let live life quiet till thrashed them. It good quakers, body men, uplift voices fighting. Human nature strong them, follow precepts. Every soul piece fighting, somehow somewhere. The world might better world without fighting, anything I know, would world; therefore I dead crying peace peace, meant be. I sorry man see folk fighting wrong people wrong things, I would deal sooner see fight them. So recorded, record, hero's fights sorts, sorts enemies, I shall proceed give account passage-at-arms one school-fellows ever encounter manner. It drawing towards close Arthur's first half-year, May evenings lengthening out. Locking-up till eight clock, everybody beginning talk would holidays. The will, form dramatis personae are, reading, amongst things, last book Homer's “Iliad,” worked far speeches women Hector's body. It whole school-day, four five School-house boys (amongst Arthur, Tom, East) preparing third lesson together. They finished regulation forty lines, part getting tired, notwithstanding exquisite pathos Helen's lamentation. And several long four-syllabled words come together, boy dictionary strikes work. “I going look words,” says he; “we done quantity. Ten one shall get far. Let us go close.” “Come along, boys,” cries East, always ready leave “the grind,” called it; “our old coach laid up, know, shall one new masters, sure go slow let us easy.” So adjournment close carried nem. con., little Arthur daring uplift voice; but, deeply interested reading, stayed quietly behind, learnt pleasure. As East said, regular master form unwell, heard one new masters--quite young man, left university. Certainly would hard lines if, dawdling much possible coming taking places, entering long-winded explanations usual course regular master form, others stock contrivances boys wasting time school, could spin lesson work forty lines. As quantity perpetual fight going master form--the latter insisting, enforcing passive resistance, prescribed quantity Homer lesson; former, fixed quantity, must always ready go fifty sixty lines time within hour. However, notwithstanding efforts, new master got horribly quick. He seemed bad taste really interested lesson, trying work something like appreciation it, giving good, spirited English words, instead wretched bald stuff rendered poor old Homer, construing piece them, boy, show done. Now clock strikes three-quarters; quarter hour more, forty lines done. So boys, one another, called up, stick more, make balder ever bald work it. The poor young master pretty near beat time, feels ready knock head wall, fingers somebody else's head. So gives altogether lower middle parts form, looks round despair boys top bench, see one strike spark two, chivalrous murder beautiful utterances beautiful woman old world. His eye rests Arthur, calls finish construing Helen's speech. Whereupon boys draw long breaths, begin stare take easy. They safe: Arthur head form, sure able construe, tide safely till hour strikes. Arthur proceeds read passage Greek construing it, custom is. Tom, paying much attention, suddenly caught falter voice reads two lines-- [greek text deleted] He looks Arthur. “Why, bless us,” thinks he, “what matter young un? He never going get floored. He sure learnt end.” Next moment reassured spirited tone Arthur begins construing, betakes drawing dogs' heads notebook, master, evidently enjoying change, turns back middle bench stands Arthur, beating sort time hand foot, saying; “Yes, yes,” “Very well,” Arthur goes on. But nears fatal two lines, Tom catches falter, looks up. He sees something matter; Arthur hardly get all. What be? Suddenly point Arthur breaks altogether, fairly bursts crying, dashes cuff jacket across eyes, blushing roots hair, feeling like go suddenly floor. The whole form taken aback; stare stupidly him, gifted presence mind find places look steadily books, hopes catching master's eye getting called Arthur's place. The master looks puzzled moment, seeing, fact is, boy really affected tears touching thing Homer, perhaps profane poetry put together, steps lays hand kindly shoulder, saying, “Never mind, little man, construed well. Stop minute; hurry.” Now, luck would it, sat next Tom day, middle bench form, big boy, name Williams, generally supposed cock will, therefore school fifths. The small boys, great speculators prowess elders, used hold forth one another Williams's great strength, discuss whether East Brown would take licking him. He called Slogger Williams, force supposed could hit. In main, rough, goodnatured fellow enough, much alive dignity. He reckoned king form, kept position strong hand, especially matter forcing boys construe legitimate forty lines. He already grunted grumbled Arthur went reading beyond forty lines; broken middle long words, Slogger's wrath fairly roused. “Sneaking little brute,” muttered he, regardless prudence--“clapping water-works hardest place; see I punch head fourth lesson.” “Whose?” said Tom, remark seemed addressed. “Why, little sneak, Arthur's,” replied Williams. “No, shall not,” said Tom. “Hullo!” exclaimed Williams, looking Tom great surprise moment, giving sudden dig ribs elbow, sent Tom's books flying floor, called attention master, turned suddenly round, seeing state things, said,-- “Williams, go three places, go on.” The Slogger found legs slowly, proceeded go Tom two boys great disgust; then, turning round facing master, said, “I learnt more, sir; lesson forty lines.” “Is so?” said master, appealing generally top bench. No answer. “Who head boy form?” said he, waxing wroth. “Arthur, sir,” answered three four boys, indicating friend. “Oh, name's Arthur. Well, now, length regular lesson?” Arthur hesitated moment, said, “We call forty lines, sir.” “How mean--you call it?” “Well, sir, Mr. Graham says stop time construe more.” “I understand,” said master.--“Williams, go three places, write lesson Greek English. And now, Arthur, finish construing.” “Oh! would I Arthur's shoes fourth lesson?” said little boys one another; Arthur finished Helen's speech without catastrophe, clock struck four, ended third lesson. Another hour occupied preparing saying fourth lesson, Williams bottling wrath; five struck, lessons day over, prepared take summary vengeance innocent misfortune. Tom detained school minutes rest, coming quadrangle, first thing saw small ring boys, applauding Williams, holding Arthur collar. “There, young sneak,” said he, giving Arthur cuff head hand; “what made say that--” “Hullo!” said Tom, shouldering crowd; “you drop that, Williams; shall touch him.” “Who stop me?” said Slogger, raising hand again. “I,” said Tom; suiting action word struck arm held Arthur's arm sharply Slogger dropped start, turned full current wrath Tom. “Will fight?” “Yes, course.” “Huzza! There going fight Slogger Williams Tom Brown!” The news ran like wildfire about, many boys way tea several houses turned back, sought back chapel, fights come off. “Just run tell East come back me,” said Tom small School-house boy, like rocket Harrowell's, stopping moment poke head School-house hall, lower boys already tea, sing out, “Fight! Tom Brown Slogger Williams.” Up start half boys once, leaving bread, eggs, butter, sprats, rest take care themselves. The greater part remainder follow minute, swallowing tea, carrying food hands consume go. Three four remain, steal butter impetuous, make unctuous feast. In another minute East Martin tear quadrangle, carrying sponge, arrive scene action combatants beginning strip. Tom felt got work cut him, stripped jacket, waistcoat, braces. East tied handkerchief round waist, rolled shirtsleeves him. “Now, old boy, open mouth say word, try help bit--we that; keep breath strength Slogger.” Martin meanwhile folded clothes, put chapel rails; Tom, East handle him, Martin give knee, steps turf, ready may come; Slogger too, stripped, thirsting fray. It look fair match first glance: Williams nearly two inches taller, probably long year older opponent, strongly made arms shoulders--“peels well,” little knot big fifth-form boys, amateurs, say, stand outside ring little boys, looking complacently on, taking active part proceedings. But good means--no spring loins, feeblish, say shipwrecky, knees. Tom, contrary, though half strong arms, good over, straight, hard, springy, neck ankle, better perhaps legs anywhere. Besides, see clear white eye, fresh, bright look skin, tip-top training, able knows; Slogger looks rather sodden, take much exercise ate much tuck. The time-keeper chosen, large ring made, two stand opposite one another moment, giving us time make little observations. “If Tom'll condescend fight head heels,” East mutters Martin, “we shall do.” But seemingly not, goes in, making play hands. Hard word; two stand one another like men; rally follows rally quick succession, fighting thought finish whole thing hand. “Cannot last rate,” say knowing ones, partisans make air ring shouts counter-shouts encouragement, approval, defiance. “Take easy, take easy; keep away; let come you,” implores East, wipes Tom's face first round wet sponge, sits back Martin's knee, supported Madman's long arms tremble little excitement. “Time's up,” calls time-keeper. “There goes again, hang all!” growls East, man again, hard ever. A severe round follows, Tom gets worst it, last hit clean legs, deposited grass right-hander Slogger. Loud shouts rise boys Slogger's house, School-house silent vicious, ready pick quarrels anywhere. “Two one half-crowns big un,” says Rattle, one amateurs, tall fellow, thunder-and-lightning waistcoat, puffy, good-natured face. “Done!” says Groove, another amateur quieter look, taking notebook enter it, friend Rattle sometimes forgets little things. Meantime East freshening Tom sponges next round, set two boys rub hands. “Tom, old boy,” whispers he, “this may fun you, death me. He hit fight another five minutes, I shall go drown island ditch. Feint him; use legs; draw about. He lose wind time, go him. Hit body too; take care frontispiece by-and-by.” Tom felt wisdom counsel, saw already could go finish Slogger mere hammer tongs, changed tactics completely third round. He fights cautiously, getting away parrying Slogger's lunging hits, instead trying counter, leading enemy dance round ring him. “He funking; go in, Williams,” “Catch up,” “Finish off,” scream small boys Slogger party. “Just want,” thinks East, chuckling himself, sees Williams, excited shouts, thinking game hands, blowing exertions get close quarters again, Tom keeping away perfect ease. They quarter ground again, Tom always defensive. The Slogger pulls last moment, fairly blown. “Now, then, Tom,” sings East, dancing delight. Tom goes twinkling, hits two heavy body blows, gets away Slogger catch wind, rushes blind fury Tom, skilfully parried avoided, overreaches falls face, amidst terrific cheers School-house boys. “Double two one?” says Groove Rattle, notebook hand. “Stop bit,” says hero, looking uncomfortably Williams, puffing away second's knee, winded enough, little worse way. After another round Slogger seems see cannot go win right off, met match thereabouts. So begins use head, tries make Tom lose patience, come time. And fight sways on, one getting trifling pull. Tom's face begins look one-sided--there little queer bumps forehead, mouth bleeding; East keeps wet sponge going scientifically comes looking fresh bright ever. Williams slightly marked face, nervous movement elbows see Tom's body blows telling. In fact, half vice Slogger's hitting neutralized, dare lunge freely fear exposing sides. It interesting time much shouting, whole ring quiet. “All right, Tommy,” whispers East; “hold on's horse win. We got last. Keep head, old boy.” But Arthur time? Words cannot paint poor little fellow's distress. He could muster courage come ring, wandered great fives court corner chapel rails, trying make mind throw them, try stop them; thinking running telling friend Mary, who, knew, would instantly report Doctor. The stories heard men killed prize-fights rose horribly him. Once only, shouts “Well done, Brown!” “Huzza School-house!” rose higher ever, ventured ring, thinking victory won. Catching sight Tom's face state I described, fear consequences vanishing mind; rushed straight matron's room, beseeching get fight stopped, die. But time us get back close. What fierce tumult confusion? The ring broken, high angry words bandied about. “It fair”--“It not”--“No hugging!” The fight stopped. The combatants, however, sit quietly, tended seconds, adherents wrangle middle. East cannot help shouting challenges two three side, though never leaves Tom moment, plies sponges fast ever. The fact is, end last round, Tom, seeing good opening, closed opponent, moment's struggle, thrown heavily, help fall learnt village rival Vale White Horse. Williams ghost chance Tom wrestling; conviction broke Slogger faction allowed man must licked. There strong feeling School catching hold throwing, though generally ruled fair within limits; ring broken fight stopped. The School-house overruled--the fight again, throwing; East, high wrath, threatens take man away next round (which mean do, way), suddenly young Brooke comes small gate end chapel. The School-house faction rush him. “Oh, hurrah! shall get fair play.” “Please, Brooke, come up. They let Tom Brown throw him.” “Throw whom?” says Brooke, coming ring. “Oh! Williams, I see. Nonsense! Of course may throw him, catches fairly waist.” Now, young Brooke, sixth, know, ought stop fights. He looks hard boys. “Anything wrong?” says East, nodding Tom. “Not bit.” “Not beat all?” “Bless you, no! Heaps fight him.--Are there, Tom?” Tom looks Brooke grins. “How he?” nodding Williams. “So so; rather done, I think, since last fall. He stand two more.” “Time's up!” The boys rise face one another. Brooke cannot find heart stop yet, round goes on, Slogger waiting Tom, reserving strength hit come wrestling dodge again, feels must stopped, sponge soon go air. And another newcomer appears field, wit, under-porter, long brush great wooden receptacle dust arm. He sweeping schools. “You would better stop, gentlemen,” says; “the Doctor knows Brown's fighting--he minute.” “You go Bath, Bill,” excellent servitor gets advice; man hands, stanch upholder School-house, cannot help stopping look bit, see Tom Brown, pet craftsman, fight round. It grim earnest now, mistake. Both boys feel this, summon every power head, hand, eye aid. A piece luck either side, foot slipping, blow getting well home, another fall, may decide it. Tom works slowly round opening; legs, choose time. The Slogger waits attack, hopes finish heavy right-handed blow. As quarter slowly ground, evening sun comes behind cloud falls full Williams's face. Tom darts in; heavy right hand delivered, grazes head. A short rally close quarters, close; another moment Slogger thrown heavily third time. “I give three two little one half-crowns,” said Groove Rattle. “No, thank 'ee,” answers other, diving hands farther coat-tails. Just stage proceedings, door turret leads Doctor's library suddenly opens, steps close, makes straight ring, Brown Slogger seated seconds' knees last time. “The Doctor! Doctor!” shouts small boy catches sight him, ring melts away seconds, small boys tearing off, Tom collaring jacket waistcoat, slipping little gate chapel, round corner Harrowell's backers, lively need be; Williams backers making quite fast across close; Groove, Rattle, bigger fellows trying combine dignity prudence comical manner, walking fast enough, hope, recognized, fast enough look like running away. Young Brooke alone remains ground time Doctor gets there, touches hat, without slight inward qualm. “Hah! Brooke. I surprised see here. Do know I expect sixth stop fighting?” Brooke felt much uncomfortable expected, rather favourite Doctor openness plainness speech, blurted out, walked Doctor's side, already turned back,-- “Yes, sir, generally. But I thought wished us exercise discretion matter too--not interfere soon.” “But fighting half-hour more,” said Doctor. “Yes, sir; neither hurt. And sort boys better friends now, would stopped, earlier--before equal.” “Who fighting Brown?” said Doctor. “Williams, sir, Thompson's. He bigger Brown, best first, came up, sir. There good deal jealousy house Thompson's, would fights let go on, either much worst it.” “Well but, Brooke,” said Doctor, “does look little exercised discretion stopping fight School-house boy getting worst it?” Brooke, must confessed, felt rather gravelled. “Now remember,” added Doctor, stopped turret-door, “this fight go on; see that. And I expect stop fights future once.” “Very well, sir,” said young Brooke, touching hat, sorry see turret-door close behind Doctor's back. Meantime Tom stanchest adherents reached Harrowell's, Sally bustling get late tea, Stumps sent Tew, butcher, get piece raw beef Tom's eye, healed off-hand, might show well morning. He bit worse, except slight difficulty vision, singing ears, sprained thumb, kept cold-water bandage, drank lots tea, listened babel voices talking speculating nothing fight, Williams would given another fall (which least believe), earth Doctor could got know it--such bad luck! He could help thinking glad won; liked better was, felt friendly Slogger. And poor little Arthur crept sat quietly near him, kept looking raw beef plaintive looks Tom last burst laughing. “Do make eyes, young un,” said he; “there nothing matter.” “Oh, but, Tom, much hurt? I cannot bear thinking me.” “Not bit it; flatter yourself. We sure sooner later.” “Well, go on, you? You promise go on?” “Cannot tell that--all depends houses. We hands countrymen, know. Must fight School-house flag, be.” However, lovers science doomed disappointment time. Directly locking-up, one night-fags knocked Tom's door. “Brown, young Brooke wants sixth-form room.” Up went Tom summons, found magnates sitting supper. “Well, Brown,” said young Brooke, nodding him, “how feel?” “Oh, well, thank you, I sprained thumb, I think.” “Sure fight. Well, worst it, I could see. Where learn throw?” “Down country I boy.” “Hullo! why, now? Well, never mind, plucky fellow. Sit supper.” Tom obeyed, means loath. And fifth-form boy next filled tumbler bottled beer, ate drank, listening pleasant talk, wondering soon fifth, one much-envied society. As got leave, Brooke said, “You must shake hands to-morrow morning; I shall come see done first lesson.” And did. And Tom Slogger shook hands great satisfaction mutual respect. And next year two, whenever fights talked of, small boys present shook heads wisely, saying, “Ah! seen fight Slogger Williams Tom Brown!” And now, boys all, three words quit subject. I put chapter fighting malice prepense, partly I want give true picture everyday school life time, kid-glove go-to-meeting-coat picture, partly cannot twaddle talked boxing fighting fists nowadays. Even Thackeray given it; weeks ago rampant stuff Times subject, article field sports. Boys quarrel, quarrel sometimes fight. Fighting fists natural English way English boys settle quarrels. What substitute there, ever there, amongst nation sun? What would like see take place? Learn box, then, learn play cricket football. Not one worse, much better, learning box well. Should never use earnest, exercise world good temper muscles back legs. As fighting, keep can, means. When time comes, ever should, say “Yes” “No” challenge fight, say “No” can--only take care make clear say “No.” It proof highest courage, done true Christian motives. It quite right justifiable, done simple aversion physical pain danger. But say “No” fear licking, say think fear God, neither Christian honest. And fight, fight out; give stand see. CHAPTER VI--FEVER IN THE SCHOOL. “This hope mortal And shall burst bond; Death keeps watch beside portal, But life dwells beyond.” --JOHN STERLING. Two years passed since events recorded last chapter, end summer half-year drawing on. Martin left gone cruise South Pacific, one uncle's ships; old magpie, disreputable ever, last bequest Arthur, lives joint study. Arthur nearly sixteen, head twenty, gone school rate form half-year. East Tom much deliberate progress, little way fifth form. Great strapping boys are, still thorough boys, filling place house young Brooke filled new boys, much sort fellows. Constant intercourse Arthur done much them, especially Tom; much remains yet done, get good Rugby got times. Arthur still frail delicate, spirit body; but, thanks intimacy Martin, learned swim, run, play cricket, never hurt much reading. One evening, sitting supper fifth-form room, one started report fever broken one boarding-houses. “They say,” added, “that Thompson ill, Dr. Robertson sent Northampton.” “Then shall sent home,” cried another. “Hurrah! five weeks' extra holidays, fifth-form examination!” “I hope not,” said Tom; “there Marylebone match end half.” Some thought one thing, another, many believe report; next day, Tuesday, Dr. Robertson arrived, stayed day, long conferences Doctor. On Wednesday morning, prayers, Doctor addressed whole school. There several cases fever different houses, said; Dr. Robertson, careful examination, assured infectious, proper care taken, could reason stopping school-work present. The examinations coming on, would unadvisable break now. However, boys chose liberty write home, and, parents wished it, leave once. He send whole school home fever spread. The next day Arthur sickened, case. Before end week thirty forty boys gone, rest stayed on. There general wish please Doctor, feeling cowardly run away. On Saturday Thompson died, bright afternoon, cricket-match going usual big-side ground. The Doctor, coming deathbed, passed along gravel-walk side close, one knew happened till next day. At morning lecture began rumoured, afternoon chapel known generally; feeling seriousness awe actual presence death among came whole school. In long years ministry Doctor perhaps never spoke words sank deeper day's sermon. “When I came yesterday visiting death-bed taken us, looked around upon familiar objects scenes within ground, common amusements going common cheerfulness activity, I felt nothing painful witnessing that; seem way shocking tune feelings sight dying Christian must supposed awaken. The unsuitableness point natural feeling scenes mourning scenes liveliness present itself. But I feel moment faults brought sometimes occur amongst us; I heard guilty falsehood, drunkenness, sin; I heard quarter language profaneness, unkindness, indecency; I heard seen signs wretched folly courts laugh fools affecting dread evil care good, unsuitableness things scene I quitted would indeed intensely painful. And why? Not things would really worse time, moment eyes opened really know good evil, feel live death becomes infinite blessing, live also good us never born.” Tom gone chapel sickening anxiety Arthur, came cheered strengthened grand words, walked alone study. And sat looked round, saw Arthur's straw hat cricket-jacket hanging pegs, marked little neat arrangements, one disturbed, tears indeed rolled cheeks; calm blessed tears, repeated himself, “Yes, Geordie's eyes opened; knows live death becomes infinite blessing. But I? O God, I bear lose him?” The week passed mournfully away. No boys sickened, Arthur reported worse day, mother arrived early week. Tom made many appeals allowed see him, several times tried get sick-room; housekeeper always way, last spoke Doctor, kindly peremptorily forbade him. Thompson buried Tuesday, burial service, soothing grand always, beyond words solemn read boy's grave companions, brought much comfort, many strange new thoughts longings. He went back regular life, played cricket bathed usual. It seemed right thing do, new thoughts longings became brave healthy effort. The crisis came Saturday; day week Thompson died; long afternoon Tom sat study reading Bible, going every half-hour housekeeper's room, expecting time hear gentle brave little spirit gone home. But God work Arthur do. The crisis passed: Sunday evening declared danger; Monday sent message Tom almost well, changed room, allowed see next day. It evening housekeeper summoned sick-room. Arthur lying sofa open window, rays western sun stole gently, lighting white face golden hair. Tom remembered German picture angel knew; often thought transparent golden spirit-like was; shuddered, think like Arthur looked, felt shock blood stopped short, realized near world friend must look like that. Never till moment felt little chum twined round heart-strings, stole gently across room knelt down, put arm round Arthur's head pillow, felt ashamed half-angry red brown face, bounding sense health power filled every fibre body, made every movement mere living joy him. He need troubled himself: strength power different drew Arthur him. Arthur laid thin, white hand, blue veins stood plainly, Tom's great brown fist, smiled him; looked window again, could bear lose moment sunset, tops great feathery elms, round rooks circling clanging, returning flocks evening's foraging parties. The elms rustled, sparrows ivy outside window chirped fluttered about, quarrelling, making again; rooks, young old, talked chorus, merry shouts boys sweet click cricket-bats came cheerily below. “Dear George,” said Tom, “I glad let see last. I tried hard come often, would let before.” “Oh, I know, Tom; Mary told every day you, obliged make Doctor speak keep away. I glad get up, might caught it; could stand ill, matches going on. And eleven, too, I hear. I glad.” “Yes; jolly?” said Tom proudly. “I ninth too. I made forty last pie-match, caught three fellows out. So I put Jones Tucker. Tucker's savage, head twenty-two.” “Well, I think ought higher yet,” said Arthur, jealous renown Tom games Tom scholar. “Never mind. I care cricket anything getting well, Geordie; I hurt, I know, would let come up. Nothing hurts me. But get directly, you? You believe clean I kept study. All things left them; I feed old magpie used, though I come big-side him, old rip. He look pleased I do, sticks head first one side other, blinks begin eat, till I half inclined box ears. And whenever East comes in, see hop window, dot go one, though Harry would touch feather now.” Arthur laughed. “Old Gravey good memory; cannot forget sieges poor Martin's den old times.” He paused moment, went on: “You cannot think often I thinking old Martin since I ill. I suppose one's mind gets restless, likes wander strange, unknown places. I wonder queer new pets old boy got. How must revelling thousand new birds, beasts, fishes!” Tom felt pang jealousy, kicked moment. “Fancy South Sea island, Cherokees, Patagonians, wild niggers!” (Tom's ethnology geography faulty, sufficient needs.) “They make old Madman cock medicine-man, tattoo over. Perhaps cutting blue, squaw wigwam. He improve boomerangs, able throw too, without old Thomas sent Doctor take away.” Arthur laughed remembrance boomerang story, looked grave again, said, “He convert island, I know.” “Yes, blow first.” “Do remember, Tom, East used laugh chaff him, said sure rooks calling-over prayers, something sort, locking-up bell rang? Well, I declare,” said Arthur, looking seriously Tom's laughing eyes, “I think right. Since I lying here, I watched every night; and, know, really come perch, them, locking-up time; first regular chorus caws; stop bit, one old fellow, perhaps two three different trees, caw solos; go again, fluttering cawing anyhow till roost.” “I wonder old blackies talk,” said Tom, looking them. “How must abuse East, pray Doctor stopping slinging!” “There! look, look!” cried Arthur; “do see old fellow without tail coming up? Martin used call 'clerk.' He cannot steer himself. You never saw fun high wind, cannot steer home, gets carried right past trees, bear perch.” The locking-up bell began toll, two boys silent, listened it. The sound soon carried Tom river woods, began go mind many occasions heard toll coming faintly breeze, pack rod hurry make run it, get gates shut. He roused start memories Arthur's voice, gentle weak late illness. “Tom, angry I talk seriously?” “No, dear old boy, I. But faint, Arthur, ill? What I get you? Do say anything hurt now--you weak; let come again.” “No, no; I shall hurt myself. I would sooner speak now, mind. I asked Mary tell Doctor me, need go calling-over; I may another chance, I shall likely go home change air get well, may come back half.” “Oh, think must go away end half? I sorry. It five weeks yet holidays, fifth-form examination half cricket-matches come yet. And shall I time alone study? Why, Arthur, twelve weeks I see again. Oh, hang it, I cannot stand that! Besides keep working examination books? I shall come bottom form, sure eggs eggs.” Tom rattling on, half joke, half earnest, wanted get Arthur serious vein, thinking would harm; Arthur broke in,-- “Oh, please, Tom, stop, drive I say head. And I already horribly afraid I going make angry.” “Do gammon, young un,” rejoined Tom (the use old name, dear old recollections, made Arthur start smile feel quite happy); “you know afraid, never made angry since first month chummed together. Now I going quite sober quarter hour, I year; make it; heave ahead, pitch right left.” “Dear Tom, I going pitch you,” said Arthur piteously; “and seems cocky advising you, backbone ever since I Rugby, made school paradise me. Ah, I see I shall never it, unless I go head heels once, said taught swim. Tom, I want give using vulgus-books cribs.” Arthur sank back pillow sigh, effort great; worst over, looked straight Tom, evidently taken aback. He leant elbows knees, stuck hands hair, whistled verse “Billy Taylor,” quite silent another minute. Not shade crossed face, clearly puzzled. At last looked up, caught Arthur's anxious look, took hand, said simply,-- “Why, young un?” “Because honestest boy Rugby, honest.” “I see that.” “What sent Rugby for?” “Well, I know exactly--nobody ever told me. I suppose boys sent public school England.” “But think yourself? What want here, carry away?” Tom thought minute. “I want A1 cricket football, games, make hands keep head fellow, lout gentleman. I want get sixth I leave, please Doctor; I want carry away much Latin Greek take Oxford respectably. There, now, young un; I never thought before, pretty much figure. Are square? What got say that?” “Why, pretty sure want, then.” “Well, I hope so. But forgot one thing--what I want leave behind me. I want leave behind me,” said Tom, speaking slow, looking much moved, “the name fellow never bullied little boy, turned back big one.” Arthur pressed hand, moment's silence went on, “You say, Tom, want please Doctor. Now, want please thinks do, really do?” “By I really do, course.” “Does think use cribs vulgus-books?” Tom felt flank turned, could give in. “He Winchester himself,” said he; “he knows it.” “Yes; think use them? Do think approves it?” “You young villain!” said Tom, shaking fist Arthur, half vexed half pleased, “I never think it. Hang it! there, perhaps not. Well, I suppose not.” Arthur saw got point; knew friend well, wise silence speech. He said, “I would sooner doctor's good opinion I really man's world.” After another minute, Tom began again, “Look here, young un. How earth I get time play matches half I give cribs? We middle long crabbed chorus Agamemnon. I make head tail crib. Then Pericles's speech coming Thucydides, 'The Birds' get examination, besides Tacitus.” Tom groaned thought accumulated labours. “I say, young un, five weeks left holidays. May I go usual half? I tell Doctor day, may.” Arthur looked window. The twilight come on, silent. He repeated low voice: “In thing Lord pardon thy servant, master goeth house Rimmon worship there, leaneth hand, I bow house Rimmon, I bow house Rimmon, Lord pardon thy servant thing.” Not word said subject, boys silent--one blessed, short silences resolves colour life often taken. Tom first break it. “You ill indeed, you, Geordie?” said he, mixture awe curiosity, feeling friend strange place scene, could form idea, full memory thoughts last week. “Yes, very. I sure Doctor thought I going die. He gave Sacrament last Sunday, cannot think one ill. He said brave, tender, gentle things me, I felt quite light strong it, never fear. My mother brought old medical man, attended I poor sickly child. He said constitution quite changed, I fit anything now. If not, I could stood three days illness. That thanks you, games made fond of.” “More thanks old Martin,” said Tom; “he real friend.” “Nonsense, Tom; never could done have.” “Well, I know; I little enough. Did tell you--you mind hearing now, I know--that poor Thompson died last week? The three boys getting quite round, like you.” “Oh yes, I heard it.” Then Tom, quite full it, told Arthur burial-service chapel, impressed him, and, believed, boys. “And though Doctor never said word it,” said he, “and half-holiday match-day, game played close afternoon, boys went Sunday.” “I glad it,” said Arthur. “But, Tom, I strange thoughts death lately. I never told soul them, even mother. Sometimes I think wrong, but, know, I think heart I could sorry death friends.” Tom taken quite aback. “What world young un now?” thought he; “I swallowed good many crotchets, altogether beats me. He cannot quite right head.” He want say word, shifted uneasily dark; however, Arthur seemed waiting answer, last said, “I think I quite see mean, Geordie. One's told often think death I tried sometimes, especially last week. But talk now. I would better go. You getting tired, I shall harm.” “No, no; indeed I not, Tom. You must stop till nine; twenty minutes. I settled shall stop till nine. And oh! let talk you--I must talk you. I see I feared. You think I half mad. Do you, now?” “Well, I think odd said, Geordie, ask me.” Arthur paused moment, said quickly, “I tell happened. At first, I sent sick-room, found I really got fever, I terribly frightened. I thought I die, I could face moment. I think sheer cowardice first, I thought hard taken away mother sisters all, I beginning see way many things, feel I might man man's work. To die without fought, worked, given one's life away, hard bear. I got terribly impatient, accused God injustice, strove justify myself. And harder I strove deeper I sank. Then image dear father often came across me, I turned it. Whenever came, heavy, numbing throb seemed take hold heart, say, 'Dead-dead-dead.' And I cried out, 'The living, living shall praise Thee, O God; dead cannot praise thee. There work grave; night man work. But I work. I great things. I great things. Why wilt thou slay me?' And I struggled plunged, deeper deeper, went living black tomb. I alone there, power stir think; alone myself; beyond reach human fellowship; beyond Christ's reach, I thought, nightmare. You, brave bright strong, idea agony. Pray God never may. Pray life.” Arthur stopped--from exhaustion, Tom thought; fear lest Arthur hurt himself, awe, longing go on, could ask, stir help him. Presently went on, quite calm slow. “I know long I state--for day, I know; I quite conscious, lived outer life time, took medicines, spoke mother, heard said. But I take much note time. I thought time me, tomb beyond. Well, last Sunday morning, I seemed lie tomb, alone, I thought, ever ever, black, dead wall cleft two, I caught borne light great power, living, mighty spirit. Tom, remember living creatures wheels Ezekiel? It like that. 'When went, I heard noise wings, like noise great waters, voice Almighty, voice speech, noise host; stood, let wings.' 'And went every one straight forward: whither spirit go, went; turned went.' And rushed bright air, full myriads living creatures, paused brink great river. And power held up, I knew great river grave, death dwelt there, death I met black tomb. That, I felt, gone ever. For bank great river I saw men women children rising pure bright, tears wiped eyes, put glory strength, weariness pain fell away. And beyond multitude man could number, worked great work; rose river went joined work. They worked, worked different way, work. And I saw father, men old town I knew I child--many hard, stern man, never came church, called atheist infidel. There were, side side father, I seen toil die them, women little children, seal foreheads all. And I longed see work was, could not; I tried plunge river, I thought I would join them, I could not. Then I looked see got river. And I could see, I saw myriads side, worked, I knew work, seal foreheads. And though I saw toil anguish work these, working blind feeble, yet I longed plunge river, know work was. And I looked I saw mother sisters, I saw Doctor, you, Tom, hundreds I knew; last I saw too, I toiling ever little piece great work. Then melted away, power left me, left I thought I heard voice say, 'The vision appointed time; though tarry, wait it, end shall speak lie, shall surely come, shall tarry.' It early morning I know, then--it quiet cool, mother fast asleep chair bedside; dream mine. I know dream. Then I fell deep sleep, woke afternoon chapel; Doctor came gave Sacrament, I told you. I told mother I get well--I knew I should; I could tell why. Tom,” said Arthur gently, another minute, “do see I could grieve see dearest friend die? It cannot be--it not--all fever illness. God would never let see clear true. I understand yet; take life longer that--to find work is.” When Arthur stopped long pause. Tom could speak; almost afraid breathe, lest break train Arthur's thoughts. He longed hear more, ask questions. In another minute nine clock struck, gentle tap door called back world again. They answer, however, moment; door opened, lady came carrying candle. She went straight sofa, took hold Arthur's hand, stooped kissed him. “My dearest boy, feel little feverish again. Why lights? You talked much, excited dark.” “Oh no, mother; cannot think well I feel. I shall start to-morrow Devonshire. But, mother, friend--here Tom Brown. You know him?” “Yes, indeed; I known years,” said, held hand Tom, standing behind sofa. This Arthur's mother: tall slight fair, masses golden hair drawn back broad, white forehead, calm blue eye meeting deep open--the eye knew well, friend's again, lovely, tender mouth trembled looked--she stood there, woman thirty-eight, old enough mother, one whose face showed lines must written faces good men's wives widows, thought never seen anything beautiful. He could help wondering Arthur's sisters like her. Tom held hand, looked straight face; could neither let go speak. “Now, Tom,” said Arthur, laughing, “where manners? You stare mother countenance.” Tom dropped little hand sigh. “There, sit down, you.--Here, dearest mother; room here.” And made place sofa her.--“Tom, need go; I sure called first lesson.” Tom felt would risk floored every lesson rest natural school-life sooner go, sat down. “And now,” said Arthur, “I realized one dearest wishes life--to see two together.” And led away talk home Devonshire, red, bright earth, deep green combes, peat streams like cairngorm pebbles, wild moor high, cloudy tors giant background picture, till Tom got jealous, stood clear chalk streams, emerald water meadows great elms willows dear old royal county, gloried call it. And mother sat quiet loving, rejoicing life. The quarter ten struck, bell rang bed, well begun talk, seemed. Then Tom rose sigh go. “Shall I see morning, Geordie?” said he, shook friend's hand. “Never mind, though; back next half. And I shall forget house Rimmon.” Arthur's mother got walked door, gave hand again; eyes met deep, loving look, like spell upon him. Her voice trembled slightly said, “Good-night. You one knows Father promised friend widow fatherless. May He deal dealt mine!” Tom quite upset; mumbled something owing everything good Geordie, looked face again, pressed hand lips, rushed downstairs study, sat till old Thomas came kicking door, tell allowance would stopped go bed. (It would stopped anyhow, great favourite old gentleman, loved come afternoons close Tom's wicket, bowl slow twisters him, talk glories bygone Surrey heroes, played former generations.) So Tom roused himself, took candle go bed; first time aware beautiful new fishing-rod, old Eton's mark it, splendidly-bound Bible, lay table, title-page written--“TOM BROWN, affectionate grateful friends, Frances Jane Arthur; George Arthur.” I leave guess slept, dreamt of. CHAPTER VII--HARRY EAST'S DILEMMAS AND DELIVERANCES. “The Holy Supper kept indeed, In whatso share another's need Not give, share, For gift without giver bare. Who bestows alms feeds three, Himself, hungering neighbour Me.” --LOWELL, The Vision Sir Launfal. The next morning, breakfast, Tom, East, Gower met usual learn second lesson together. Tom considering break proposal giving crib others, found better way (as indeed none better ever found man boy), told simply happened; see Arthur, talked upon subject, said, part made mind, going use cribs more; quite sure ground, took high pathetic tone, proceeding say “how that, learnt lessons many years, would grieve much put end arrangement, hoped, rate, would go him, still good friends, respect one another's motives; but--” Here boys, listening open eyes ears, burst in,-- “Stuff nonsense!” cried Gower. “Here, East, get crib find place.” “O Tommy, Tommy!” said East, proceeding bidden, “that ever come this! I knew Arthur'd ruin day, me. And time's come.” And made doleful face. “I know ruin,” answered Tom; “I know I would sack long ago him. And know well I.” “Well, baddish way came, I own; new crotchet past joke.” “Let us give trial, Harry; come. You know often right wrong.” “Now, two jawing away young Square-toes,” struck Gower. “He end sucking wiseacre, I dare say; time lose, I got fives court half-past nine.” “I say, Gower,” said Tom appealingly, “be good fellow, let us try cannot get without crib.” “What! chorus? Why, shall get ten lines.” “I say, Tom,” cried East, hit new idea, “do remember, upper fourth, old Momus caught construing leaf crib I would torn put book, would float floor, sent flogged it?” “Yes, I remember well.” “Well, Doctor, would flogged me, told flog using translation, taking lesson, using I learnt word I came in. He said harm using translation get clue hard passages, tried could first make without.” “Did he, though?” said Tom; “then Arthur must wrong.” “Of course is,” said Gower--“the little prig. We use crib cannot construe without it.--Go ahead, East.” And agreement started--Tom, satisfied made confession, sorry locus penitentiae, deprived altogether use old faithful friend. The boys went usual, taking sentence turn, crib handed one whose turn construe. Of course Tom could object this, as, simply lying appealed case sentence prove hard altogether construer? But must owned Gower East make tremendous exertions conquer sentences recourse help. Tom, however, heroic virtue gallantry, rushed sentence, searching high-minded manner nominative verb, turning dictionary frantically first hard word stopped him. But meantime Gower, bent getting fives, would peep quietly crib, suggest, “Do think meaning?” “I think must take way, Brown.” And Tom see way profiting suggestions, lesson went quickly usual, Gower able start fives court within five minutes half-hour. When Tom East left face face, looked one another minute, Tom puzzled, East chokefull fun, burst roar laughter. “Well, Tom,” said East, recovering himself, “I see objection new way. It good old one, I think, besides advantage gives one feeling virtuous, looking one's neighbours.” Tom shoved hand back hair. “I sure,” said he; “you two fellows carried legs. I think really tried one sentence fairly. Are sure remember Doctor said you?” “Yes. And I swear I could make one sentences to-day--no, ever could. I really remember,” said East, speaking slowly impressively, “to come across one Latin Greek sentence half I could go construe light nature. Whereby I sure Providence intended cribs used.” “The thing find out,” said Tom meditatively, “is long one ought grind sentence without looking crib. Now I think one fairly looks words one know, cannot hit it, enough.” “To sure, Tommy,” said East demurely, merry twinkle eye. “Your new doctrine too, old fellow,” added he, “when one comes think it, cutting root school morality. You take away mutual help, brotherly love, or, vulgar tongue, giving construes, I hold one highest virtues. For distinguish getting construe another boy using crib? Hang it, Tom, going deprive school-fellows chance exercising Christian benevolence good Samaritans, I shall cut concern.” “I wish would joke it, Harry; hard enough see one's way--a precious sight harder I thought last night. But I suppose use abuse both, one'll get straight enough somehow. But cannot make out, anyhow, one right use old vulgus-books copy-books.” “Hullo, heresy! How fast fellow goes downhill gets head legs. Listen me, Tom. Not use old vulgus-books! Why, Goth, take benefit wisdom admire use work past generations? Not use old copy-books! Why, might well say ought pull Westminster Abbey, put go-to-meeting shop churchwarden windows; never read Shakespeare, Sheridan Knowles. Think work labour predecessors bestowed books; make work value?” “I say, Harry, please chaff; I really serious.” “And then, duty consult pleasure others rather own, all, masters? Fancy, then, difference looking vulgus carefully touched retouched others, must bring sort dreamy pleasure, would met thought expression somewhere another--before born perhaps--and cutting up, making picture-frames round false quantities, monstrosities. Why, Tom, would cruel never let old Momus hum 'O genus humanum' again, look doubtingly spectacles, end smiling giving three extra marks it--just old sake's sake, I suppose.” “Well,” said Tom, getting something like huff capable of, “it deuced hard fellow's really trying ought, best friends'll nothing chaff try put down.” And stuck books arm hat head, preparatory rushing quadrangle, testify soul faithlessness friendships. “Now ass, Tom,” said East, catching hold him; “you know well enough time; bark's worse bite. You cannot expect ride new crotchet without anybody's trying stick nettle tail make kick off--especially shall go foot still. But sit down, let us go again. I serious judge.” Then Tom sat table, waxed eloquent righteousnesses advantages new plan, whenever took anything, going life depended upon it, sparing abuse could think of, opposite method, denounced ungentlemanly, cowardly, mean, lying, one knows besides. “Very cool Tom,” East thought, say, “seeing came Egypt last night bedtime.” “Well, Tom,” said last, “you see, I came school none sort notions. You may right--I dare say are. Only one always felt masters is, fair trial skill last us them--like match football battle. We natural enemies school--that fact. We got learn much Latin Greek, many verses, got see it. If slip collar much less without getting caught, one us. If get us, catch us shirking, one them. All's fair war lying. If I run luck theirs, go school without looking lessons, get called up, I snob sneak? I tell master I learnt it. He got find whether I not. What paid for? If calls I get floored, makes write Greek English. Very good. He caught me, I grumble. I grant you, I go snivel him, tell I really tried learn it, found hard without translation, say I toothache, humbug kind, I snob. That school morality; served me, too, Tom, matter that, five years. And clear fair, mistake it. We understand it, understand it, I know come other.” Tom looked pleased little puzzled. He never heard East speak mind seriously before, could help feeling completely hit theory practice time. “Thank you, old fellow,” said he. “You good old brick serious, put me. I said I meant, I dare say, see I know I right. Whatever Gower rest do, I shall hold on. I must. And new uphill game, see, one must hit hard hold tight first.” “Very good,” said East; “hold hit away, hit line.” “But I must bring over, Harry, I shall comfortable. Now, I allow said. We always honourable enemies masters. We found state war came, went course. Only think things altered good deal? I feel I used masters. They seem treat one quite differently.” “Yes, perhaps do,” said East; “there new set see, mostly, feel sure yet. They want fight till know ground.” “I think that,” said Tom. “And Doctor, treat one openly, like gentleman, one working him.” “Well, does,” said East; “he splendid fellow, I get sixth I shall act accordingly. Only know nothing lessons now, except examining us. I say, though,” looking watch, “it quarter. Come along.” As walked got message, say Arthur starting, would like say goodbye. So went private entrance School-house, found open carriage, Arthur propped pillows it, looking already better, Tom thought. They jumped steps shake hands him, Tom mumbled thanks presents found study, looked round anxiously Arthur's mother. East, fallen back usual humour, looked quaintly Arthur, said,-- “So again, hot-headed convert there. He making lives burden us morning using cribs. I shall get floored certainty second lesson, I called up.” Arthur blushed looked down. Tom struck in,-- “Oh, right. He converted already; always comes mud us, grumbling sputtering.” The clock struck, go school, wishing Arthur pleasant holiday, Tom, lingering behind moment send thanks love Arthur's mother. Tom renewed discussion second lesson, succeeded far get East promise give new plan fair trial. Encouraged success, evening, sitting alone large study, East lived almost, “vice Arthur leave,” examining new fishing-rod, pronounced genuine article (“play enough throw midge tied single hair wind, strength enough hold grampus”), naturally began talking Arthur. Tom, still bubbling last night's scene thoughts last week, wanting clinch fix whole mind, could never without first going process belabouring somebody else all, suddenly rushed subject Arthur's illness, said death. East given desired opening. After serio-comic grumble, “that life worth having, tied young beggar always 'raising standard;' he, East, like prophet's donkey, obliged struggle donkey-man went prophet; none pleasure starting new crotchets, half understand them, take kicks carry luggage fun,” threw legs sofa, put hands behind head, said,-- “Well, all, wonderful little fellow I ever came across. There meek, humble boy school. Hanged I think now, really, Tom, believes much worse fellow I, think influence house Dot Bowles, came last quarter, ten yet. But turns round little finger, old boy--there mistake that.” And East nodded Tom sagaciously. “Now never!” thought Tom; so, shutting eyes hardening heart, went straight it, repeating Arthur said, near could remember it, words, thought. The life seemed ooze went on, several times felt inclined stop, give up, change subject. But somehow borne on; necessity upon speak out, so. At end looked East anxiety, delighted see young gentleman thoughtful attentive. The fact is, stage inner life Tom lately arrived, intimacy friendship East could lasted made aware of, sharer in, thoughts beginning exercise him. Nor indeed could friendship lasted East shown sympathy thoughts; great relief unbosomed himself, found friend could listen. Tom always sort instinct East's levity skin-deep, instinct true one. East want reverence anything felt real; one natures burst generally called recklessness impiety moment feel anything poured upon good come home inborn sense right, appeals anything like self-interest them. Daring honest nature, outspoken extent alarmed respectabilities, constant fund animal health spirits feel bound curb way, gained steady part school (including well wished appear steady really so) character boy would dangerous intimate; hatred everything cruel, underhand, false, hearty respect would see good true, kept rest. Tom, besides like East many points character, largely developed composition capacity taking weakest side. This putting strongly enough: necessity him; could help could eating drinking. He could never play strongest side heart football cricket, sure make friends boy unpopular, luck. Now, though East generally called unpopular, Tom felt every day, characters developed, stood alone, make friends among contemporaries, therefore sought out. Tom much popular, power detecting humbug much less acute, instincts much sociable. He period life, too, largely given taking people gave be; singleness heart, fearlessness, honesty East appreciated, thus two drawn great intimacy. This intimacy interrupted Tom's guardianship Arthur. East often, said, joined reading Bible; discussions almost always turned upon characters men women read, become personal themselves. In fact, two shrunk personal religious discussion, knowing might end, fearful risking friendship dear both, felt somehow, without quite knowing why, would never same, either tenfold stronger sapped foundation, communing together. What bother explaining is! I wish could get without it. But cannot. However, find, found already, time comes every human friendship must go depths yourself, lay bare friend, wait fear answer. A moments may it; may (most likely be, English boys) never once. But done must be, friendship worth name. You must find there, root bottom one another's hearts; one there, nothing earth least ought sunder you. East remained lying Tom finished speaking, fearing interrupt him; sat table, leant head one hand, taking pencil other, working little holes table-cover. After bit looked up, stopped pencil, said, “Thank much, old fellow. There boy house would done Arthur. I see well enough,” went on, pause, “all best big fellows look suspicion; think I devil-may-care, reckless young scamp. So I am--eleven hours twelve, twelfth. Then contemporaries worth knowing follow suit, course: good friends games that, soul Arthur ever tried break crust, see whether anything bottom me; bad ones I stand know that.” “Do think half fancy, Harry?” “Not bit it,” said East bitterly, pegging away pencil. “I see plain enough. Bless you, think everybody's straightforward kindhearted are.” “Well, reason it? There must reason. You play games well one sing best song, best company house. You fancy liked, Harry. It fancy.” “I wish was, Tom. I know I could popular enough bad ones, I have, good ones me.” “Why not?” persisted Tom; “you drink swear, get night; never bully, cheat lessons. If showed liked it, would best fellows house running you.” “Not I,” said East. Then effort went on, “I tell is. I never stop Sacrament. I see, Doctor downwards, tells me.” “Yes, I seen that,” said Tom, “and I sorry it, Arthur I talked it. I often thought speaking you, hard begin subjects. I glad opened it. Now, you?” “I never confirmed,” said East. “Not confirmed!” said Tom, astonishment. “I never thought that. Why confirmed rest us nearly three years ago? I always thought would confirmed home.” “No,” answered East sorrowfully; “you see happened. Last Confirmation soon Arthur came, taken I hardly saw either you. Well, Doctor sent round us it, I living mostly Green's set. You know sort. They went in. I dare say right, got good it; I want judge them. Only I could see reasons drove way. It Was 'because Doctor liked it;' 'no boy got stay Sacrament;' 'correct thing,' fact, like good hat wear Sundays. I could stand it. I feel I wanted lead different life. I well content I was, I going sham religious curry favour Doctor, one else.” East stopped speaking, pegged away diligently ever pencil. Tom ready cry. He felt half sorry first confirmed himself. He seemed deserted earliest friend--to left worst need long years. He got went sat East, put arm shoulder. “Dear old boy,” said, “how careless selfish I been. But come talk Arthur me?” “I wish Heaven I had,” said East, “but I fool. It late talking now.” “Why late? You want confirmed now, you?” “I think so,” said East. “I thought good deal; only, often I fancy I must changing, I see good here--just stopped last time. And I go back again.” “I tell me,” said Tom warmly. “If Arthur, I done did. I hope I should. I honour it. But made taking weak side world--going everything strong rich, proud respectable, little band brothers whole world. And Doctor seemed say too, said great deal more.” “Ah!” groaned East, “but again, another difficulties whenever I think matter. I want one saints, one elect, whatever right phrase is. My sympathies way--with many, poor devils run streets go church. Do stare, Tom; mind, I telling heart--as far I know it--but muddle. You must gentle want land me. Now I seen deal sort religion; I bred it, I cannot stand it. If nineteen-twentieths world left uncovenanted mercies, sort thing, means plain English go hell, twentieth rejoice all, why--” “Oh! but, Harry, not, not,” broke Tom, really shocked. “Oh, I wish Arthur gone! I fool things. But want too, East; indeed. It cuts ways somehow, confirmed taking Sacrament. It makes feel side good bad too, everybody world. Only great dark strong power, crushing everybody else. That Christ conquered, got fight. What fool I am! I cannot explain. If Arthur here!” “I begin get glimmering mean,” said East. “I say, now,” said Tom eagerly, “do remember hated Flashman?” “Of course I do,” said East; “I hate still. What then?” “Well, I came take Sacrament, I great struggle that. I tried put head; I could that, I tried think evil--as something Lord loving hated, I might hate too. But would do. I broke down; I believe Christ Himself broke down. And Doctor gave bread wine, leant praying, I prayed poor Flashman, Arthur.” East buried face hands table. Tom could feel table tremble. At last looked up. “Thank again, Tom,” said he; “you know may done to-night. I think I see right sort sympathy poor devils got at.” “And stop Sacrament next time, you?” said Tom. “Can I, I confirmed?” “Go ask Doctor.” “I will.” That night, prayers, East followed Doctor, old verger bearing candle, upstairs. Tom watched, saw Doctor turn round heard footsteps following closer usual, say, “Hah, East! Do want speak me, man?” “If please, sir.” And private door closed, Tom went study state great trouble mind. It almost hour East came back. Then rushed breathless. “Well, right,” shouted, seizing Tom hand. “I feel ton weight mind.” “Hurrah,” said Tom. “I knew would be; tell us it.” “Well, I told it. You cannot think kind gentle was, great grim man, I feared anybody earth. When I stuck, lifted I would little child. And seemed know I would felt, gone all. And I burst crying--more I done five years; sat me, stroked head; I went blundering on, told all--much worse things I told you. And shocked bit, snub me, tell I fool, nothing pride wickedness, though I dare say was. And tell follow thoughts, give cut-and-dried explanation. But I would done talked bit. I hardly remember said yet; seemed spread round like healing, strength, light, bear up, plant rock, I could hold footing fight myself. I know do, I feel happy. And owing you, dear old boy!” And seized Tom's hand again. “And come Communion?” said Tom. “Yes, confirmed holidays.” Tom's delight great friend's. But yet talk, bent improving occasion: proceeded propound Arthur's theory sorry friends' deaths, hitherto kept background, much exercised; feel honest take pleased him, throw rest, trying vigorously persuade like best friends die off-hand. But East's powers remaining serious exhausted, five minutes saying ridiculous things could think of, till Tom almost getting angry again. Despite himself, however, could help laughing giving up, East appealed with, “Well, Tom, going punch head, I hope, I insist upon sorry got earth?” And talk finished time, tried learn first lesson, poor success, appeared next morning, called narrowly escaped floored, ill-luck, however, sit heavily either souls. CHAPTER VIII--TOM BROWN'S LAST MATCH. “Heaven grant manlier heart, timely ere Youth fly, life's real tempest would coping; The fruit dreamy hoping Is, waking, blank despair.”--CLOUGH, Ambarvalia. The curtain rises upon last act little drama, hard-hearted publishers warn single volume must necessity end. Well, well! pleasantest things must come end. I little thought last long vacation, I began pages help away spare time watering-place, vividly many old scene lain hid away years dusty old corner brain, would come back again, stand clear bright happened yesterday. The book grateful task me, I hope you, dear young friends, read (friends assuredly must be, get far this), half sorry come last stage I am. Not solemn sad side it. As old scenes became living, actors became living too, many grave Crimea distant India, well quiet churchyards dear old country, seemed open send forth dead, voices looks ways one's ears eyes, old School-days. But sad. How be, believe Lord taught us? How be, one turn wheel, shall sides again, learning again, perhaps, new boys. Then others old faces dear us somehow another gone clean sight. Are dead living? We know not, thought brings sadness it. Wherever are, well believe God's work getting His wages. But some, still see sometimes streets, whose haunts homes know, could probably find almost day week set it, yet really farther dead, gone ken? Yes, must such; therein lies sadness old School memories. Yet old comrades, time space separate us, whose sides feel sure shall stand time shall more. We may think one another dangerous fanatics narrow bigots, truce possible, shall sever end lives, would respective duties imprison hang, power. We must go way, theirs, long flesh spirit hold together; let Rugby poet speak words healing trial:-- “To veer vain! on, onward strain, Brave barks, light, darkness too; Through winds tides one compass guides,-- To that, selves, true. “But, O blithe breeze, O great seas, Though never earliest parting past, On wide plain join again; Together lead home last. “One port, methought, alike sought, One purpose hold where'er fare. O bounding breeze, O rushing seas, At last, last, unite there!” * * Clough, Ambarvalia. This mere longing; prophecy. So too, old friends, friends more, sorrow men without hope. It seem us lost compass purpose, driven helplessly rocks quicksands, whose lives spent service world, flesh, devil, self alone, fellow-men, country, God, must mourn pray without sure hope without light, trusting He, whose hands well are, died well us, sees His creatures “With larger eyes ours, To make allowance us all,” will, His way His time, lead also home. Another two years passed, end summer half-year Rugby; fact, School broken up. The fifth-form examinations last week, upon followed speeches, sixth-form examinations exhibitions; now. The boys gone winds heaven, except town boys eleven, enthusiasts besides asked leave stay houses see result cricket matches. For year Wellesburn return match Marylebone match played Rugby, great delight town neighbourhood, sorrow aspiring young cricketers reckoning last three months showing Lord's ground. The Doctor started Lakes yesterday morning, interview captain eleven, presence Thomas, arranged school cricket dinners be, matters necessary satisfactory carrying festivities, warned keeping spirituous liquors close, gates closed nine clock. The Wellesburn match played great success yesterday, School winning three wickets; to-day great event cricketing year, Marylebone match, played. What match been! The London eleven came afternoon train yesterday, time see end Wellesburn match; soon over, leading men umpire inspected ground, criticising rather unmercifully. The captain School eleven, one two others, played Lord's match before, knew old Mr. Aislabie several Lord's men, accompanied them; rest eleven looked Three Trees admiring eyes, asked one another names illustrious strangers, recounted many runs made late matches Bell's Life. They looked hard-bitten, wiry, whiskered fellows young adversaries felt rather desponding result morrow's match. The ground last chosen, two men set work upon water roll; then, yet half-hour daylight, one suggested dance turf. The close half full citizens families, idea hailed enthusiasm. The cornopean player still ground. In five minutes eleven half dozen Wellesburn Marylebone men got partners somehow another, merry country-dance going on, every one flocked, new couples joined every minute, till hundred going middle again; long line school buildings looked gravely them, every window glowing last rays western sun; rooks clanged tops old elms, greatly excited, resolved country-dance too; great flag flapped lazily gentle western breeze. Altogether sight would made glad heart brave old founder, Lawrence Sheriff, half good fellow I take been. It cheerful sight see. But made valuable sight captain School eleven saw young hands shaking shyness awe Lord's men, crossed hands capered grass together; strangers entered all, threw away cigars, danced shouted like boys; old Mr. Aislabie stood looking white hat, leaning bat, benevolent enjoyment. “This hop worth thirty runs us to-morrow, making Raggles Johnson,” thinks young leader, revolves many things mind, standing side Mr. Aislabie, leave minute, feels character School courtesy resting shoulders. But quarter nine struck, saw old Thomas beginning fidget keys hand, thought Doctor's parting monition, stopped cornopean once, notwithstanding loud-voiced remonstrances sides; crowd scattered away close, eleven going School-house, supper beds provided Doctor's orders. Deep consultations supper order going in, bowl first over, whether would best play steady freely; youngest hands declared bit nervous, praised opponents jolliest fellows world, except perhaps old friends Wellesburn men. How far little good-nature elders go right sort boys! The morning dawned bright warm, intense relief many anxious youngster, betimes mark signs weather. The eleven went body breakfast, plunge cold bath corner close. The ground splendid order, soon ten clock, spectators arrived, ready, two Lord's men took places wickets--the School, usual liberality young hands, put adversaries first. Old Bailey stepped wicket, called play, match begun. “Oh, well bowled! well bowled, Johnson!” cries captain, catching ball sending high rook trees, third Marylebone man walks away wicket, old Bailey gravely sets middle stump puts bails on. “How many runs?” Away scamper three boys scoring table, back minute amongst rest eleven, collected together knot wicket. “Only eighteen runs, three wickets down!” “Huzza old Rugby!” sings Jack Raggles, long-stop, toughest burliest boys, commonly called “Swiper Jack,” forthwith stands head, brandishes legs air triumph, till next boy catches hold heels, throws back. “Steady there; ass, Jack,” says captain; “we got best wicket yet. Ah, look cover-point,” adds he, sees long-armed bare-headed, slashing-looking player coming wicket. “And, Jack, mind hits. He steals runs man England.” And find got work now. The newcomer's off-hitting tremendous, running like flash lightning. He never ground except wicket down. Nothing whole game trying boys. He stolen three byes first ten minutes, Jack Raggles furious, begins throwing savagely farther wicket, sternly stopped captain. It young gentlemen keep team steady, knows everything depends it, faces work bravely. The score creeps fifty; boys begin look blank; spectators, mustering strong, silent. The ball flies bat parts field, gives rest catches one. But cricket full glorious chances, goddess presides loves bring skilful players. Johnson, young bowler, getting wild, bowls ball almost wide off; batter steps cuts beautifully cover-point standing deep--in fact almost ground. The ball comes skimming twisting along three feet ground; rushes it, sticks somehow fingers left hand, utter astonishment whole field. Such catch made close years, cheering maddening. “Pretty cricket,” says captain, throwing ground deserted wicket long breath. He feels crisis passed. I wish I space describe match--how captain stumped next man leg-shooter, bowled small cobs old Mr. Aislabie, came last wicket; Lord's men half-past twelve clock ninety-eight runs; captain School eleven went first give men pluck, scored twenty-five beautiful style; Rugby four behind first innings; glorious dinner fourth-form school; cover-point hitter sang topping comic songs, old Mr. Aislabie made best speeches ever heard, afterwards. But I space--that fact; must fancy all, carry half-past seven clock, School in, five wickets down, thirty-two runs make win. The Marylebone men played carelessly second innings, working like horses save match. There much healthy, hearty, happy life scattered close; group I beg call especial attention there, slope island, looks towards cricket-ground. It consists three figures; two seated bench, one ground feet. The first, tall, slight rather gaunt man, bushy eyebrow dry, humorous smile, evidently clergyman. He carelessly dressed, looks rather used up, much wondered at, seeing finished six weeks examination work; basks, spreads evening sun, bent enjoying life, though quite know arms legs. Surely friend young master, glimpses before, face gained great deal since last came across him. And side, white flannel shirt trousers, straw hat, captain's belt, untanned yellow cricket shoes eleven wear, sits strapping figure, near six feet high, ruddy, tanned face whiskers, curly brown hair, laughing, dancing eye. He leaning forward elbows resting knees, dandling favourite bat, made thirty forty runs to-day, strong brown hands. It Tom Brown, grown young man nineteen years old, praepostor captain eleven, spending last day Rugby boy, and, let us hope, much wiser bigger, since last pleasure coming across him. And feet warm, dry ground, similarly dressed, sits Arthur, Turkish fashion, bat across knees. He longer boy--less boy, fact, Tom, one may judge thoughtfulness face, somewhat paler, too, one could wish; figure, though slight, well knit active, old timidity disappeared, replaced silent, quaint fun, face twinkles over, listens broken talk two, joins every then. All three watching game eagerly, joining cheering follows every good hit. It pleasing see easy, friendly footing pupils master, perfectly respectful, yet reserve nothing forced intercourse. Tom clearly abandoned old theory “natural enemies” case rate. But time listen saying, see gather it. “I object theory,” says master, “and I allow made fair case yourself. But now, books Aristophanes, instance, reading play half Doctor, you?” “Yes, Knights,” answered Tom. “Well, I sure would enjoyed wonderful humour twice much taken pains scholarship.” “Well, sir, I believe boy form enjoyed sets-to Cleon Sausage-seller I did--eh, Arthur?” said Tom, giving stir foot. “Yes, I must say did,” said Arthur. “I think, sir, hit upon wrong book there.” “Not bit it,” said master. “Why, passages arms, thoroughly appreciate unless master weapons? weapons language, you, Brown, never half worked at; so, I say, must lost delicate shades meaning make best part fun.” “Oh, well played! bravo, Johnson!” shouted Arthur, dropping bat clapping furiously, Tom joined “Bravo, Johnson!” might heard chapel. “Eh! it? I see,” inquired master. “They got one run, I thought?” “No, ball, three-quarters length, coming straight leg bail. Nothing turn wrist could saved him, drew away leg safe one.--Bravo, Johnson!” “How well bowling, though,” said Arthur; “they mean beat, I see.” “There now,” struck master; “you see I preaching half-hour. The delicate play true thing. I understand cricket, I enjoy fine draws tell best play, though Raggles hit ball hard away six I delighted one. Do see analogy?” “Yes, sir,” answered Tom, looking roguishly, “I see; question remains whether I got good understanding Greek particles cricket thoroughly. I thick, I never time both.” “I see incorrigible,” said master, chuckle; “but I refute example. Arthur taken Greek cricket too.” “Yes, thanks him; Greek came natural him. Why, first came I remember used read Herodotus pleasure I Don Quixote, could made false concord would tried ever hard; I looked cricket.” “Out! Bailey given out. Do see, Tom?” cries Arthur. “How foolish run hard.” “Well, cannot helped; played well. Whose turn go in?” “I know; got list tent.” “Let us go see,” said Tom, rising; moment Jack Raggles two three came running island moat. “O Brown, may I go next?” shouts Swiper. “Whose name next list?” says captain. “Winter's, Arthur's,” answers boy carries it; “but twenty-six runs get, time lose. I heard Mr. Aislabie say stumps must drawn quarter past eight exactly.” “Oh, let Swiper go in,” chorus boys; Tom yields better judgment. “I dare say I lost match nonsense,” says, sits again; “they sure get Jack's wicket three four minutes; however, chance, sir, seeing hard hit two,” adds he, smiling, turning master. “Come, none irony, Brown,” answers master. “I beginning understand game scientifically. What noble game is, too!” “Is it? But game. It institution,” said Tom. “Yes,” said Arthur--“the birthright British boys old young, habeas corpus trial jury British men.” “The discipline reliance one another teaches valuable, I think,” went master, “it ought unselfish game. It merges individual eleven; play may win, side may.” “That true,” said Tom, “and football cricket, one comes think it, much better games fives hare-and-hounds, others object come first win oneself, one's side may win.” “And captain eleven!” said master; “what post School-world! almost hard Doctor's--requiring skill gentleness firmness, I know rare qualities.” “Which may wish may get!” said Tom, laughing; “at rate got yet, would flat to-night let Jack Raggles go turn.” “Ah, Doctor never would done that,” said Arthur demurely. “Tom, great deal learn yet art ruling.” “Well, I wish would tell Doctor then, get let stop till I twenty. I want leave, I sure.” “What sight is,” broke master, “the Doctor ruler! Perhaps little corner British Empire thoroughly, wisely, strongly ruled now. I thankful every day life I came him.” “So I, I sure,” said Tom, “and sorry I got leave.” “Every place thing one sees reminds one wise act his,” went master. “This island now--you remember time, Brown, laid small gardens, cultivated frost-bitten fags February March?” “Of course I do,” said Tom; “did I hate spending two hours afternoon grubbing tough dirt stump fives bat? But turf-cart good fun enough.” “I dare say was, always leading fights townspeople; stealing flowers gardens Rugby Easter show abominable.” “Well, was,” said Tom, looking down, “but fags could help ourselves. But Doctor's ruling?” “A great deal, I think,” said master; “what brought island-fagging end?” “Why, Easter speeches put till midsummer,” said Tom, “and sixth gymnastic poles put here.” “Well, changed time speeches, put idea gymnastic poles heads worships sixth form?” said master. “The Doctor, I suppose,” said Tom. “I never thought that.” “Of course not,” said master, “or else, fag were, would shouted whole school putting old customs. And way Doctor's reforms carried left himself--quietly naturally, putting good thing place bad, letting bad die out; wavering, hurry--the best thing could done time being, patience rest.” “Just Tom's way,” chimed Arthur, nudging Tom elbow--“driving nail go;” allusion Tom answered sly kick. “Exactly so,” said master, innocent allusion by-play. Meantime Jack Raggles, sleeves tucked great brown elbows, scorning pads gloves, presented wicket; run one forward drive Johnson's, receive first ball. There twenty-four runs make, four wickets go down--a winning match play decently steady. The ball swift one, rises fast, catching Jack outside thigh, bounding away india-rubber, run two leg-bye amidst great applause shouts Jack's many admirers. The next ball beautifully-pitched ball outer stump, reckless unfeeling Jack catches hold of, hits right round leg five, applause becomes deafening. Only seventeen runs get four wickets! The game ours! It now, Jack walks swaggering wicket, bat shoulder, Mr. Aislabie holds short parley men. Then cover-point hitter, cunning man, goes bowl slow twisters. Jack waves hand triumphantly towards tent, much say, “See I finish three hits.” Alas, son Jack, enemy old thee. The first ball Jack steps meets, swiping force. If allowed twist! But not, ball goes spinning straight air, would never come again. Away runs Jack, shouting trusting chapter accidents; bowler runs steadily it, judging every spin, calling out, “I it,” catches it, playfully pitches back stalwart Jack, departing rueful countenance. “I knew would be,” says Tom, rising. “Come along; game's getting serious.” So leave island go tent; deep consultation, Arthur sent in, goes wicket last exhortation Tom play steady keep bat straight. To suggestions Winter best bat left, Tom replies, “Arthur steadiest, Johnson make runs wicket kept up.” “I surprised see Arthur eleven,” said master, stood together front dense crowd, closing round ground. “Well, I quite sure ought play,” said Tom, “but I could help putting in. It much good, cannot think I owe him.” The master smiled. The clock strikes eight, whole field becomes fevered excitement. Arthur, two narrow escapes, scores one, Johnson gets ball. The bowling fielding superb, Johnson's batting worthy occasion. He makes two, one, managing keep ball himself, Arthur backs runs perfectly. Only eleven runs make now, crowd scarcely breathe. At last Arthur gets ball again, actually drives forward two, feels prouder got three best prizes, hearing Tom's shout joy, “Well played, well played, young un!” But next ball much young hand, bails fly different ways. Nine runs make, two wickets go down: much human nerves. Before Winter get in, omnibus take Lord's men train pulls side close, Mr. Aislabie Tom consult, give stumps drawn next over. And ends great match. Winter Johnson carry bats, and, one day's match, Lord's men declared winners, scored first innings. But defeat victory: think Tom School eleven, accompany conquerors omnibus, send three ringing cheers, Mr. Aislabie shaken hands round, saying Tom, “I must compliment you, sir, eleven, I hope shall member come town.” As Tom rest eleven turning back close, everybody beginning cry another country-dance, encouraged success night before, young master, leaving close, stopped him, asked come tea half-past eight, adding, “I keep half hour, ask Arthur come too.” “I come directly, let me,” said Tom, “for I feel rather melancholy, quite country-dance supper rest.” “Do, means,” said master; “I wait you.” So Tom went get boots things tent, tell Arthur invitation, speak second command stopping dancing shutting close soon grew dusk. Arthur promised follow soon dance. So Tom handed things man charge tent, walked quietly away gate master waiting, two took way together Hillmorton road. Of course found master's house locked up, servants away close--about time, doubt, footing away grass, extreme delight themselves, utter oblivion unfortunate bachelor master, whose one enjoyment shape meals “dish tea” (as grandmothers called it) evening; phrase apt case, always poured saucer drinking. Great good man's horror finding shut house. Had alone would treated matter course, would strolled contentedly gravel walk one came home; hurt stain character host, especially guest pupil. However, guest seemed think great joke, presently, poked round house, mounted wall, could reach passage window. The window, turned out, bolted, another minute Tom house front door, opened inside. The master chuckled grimly burglarious entry, insisted leaving hall-door two front windows open, frighten truants return; two set foraging tea, operation master much fault, faintest possible idea find anything, being, moreover, wondrously short-sighted; Tom, sort instinct, knew right cupboards kitchen pantry, soon managed place snuggery table better materials meal appeared probably reign tutor, initiated, amongst things, excellence mysterious condiment, dripping-cake. The cake newly baked, rich flaky; Tom found reposing cook's private cupboard, awaiting return; warning finished last crumb. The kettle sang away merrily hob snuggery, for, notwithstanding time year, lighted fire, throwing windows wide open time; heaps books papers pushed away end table, great solitary engraving King's College Chapel mantelpiece looked less stiff usual, settled twilight serious drinking tea. After talk match, indifferent subjects, conversation came naturally back Tom's approaching departure, began make moan. “Well, shall miss quite much miss us,” said master. “You Nestor School now, not?” “Yes, ever since East left,” answered Tom. “By-the-bye, heard him?” “Yes, I letter February, started India join regiment.” “He make capital officer.” “Ay, he!” said Tom, brightening. “No fellow could handle boys better, I suppose soldiers like boys. And never tell go go himself. No mistake that. A braver fellow never walked.” “His year sixth taught good deal useful now.” “So will,”' said Tom, staring fire. “Poor dear Harry,” went on--“how well I remember day put twenty! How rose situation, burnt cigar-cases, gave away pistols, pondered constitutional authority sixth, new duties Doctor, fifth form, fags! Ay, fellow ever acted better, though always people's man--for fags, constituted authorities. He could help that, know. I sure Doctor must liked him?” said Tom, looking inquiringly. “The Doctor sees good every one, appreciates it,” said master dogmatically; “but I hope East get good colonel. He cannot respect him. How long took him, even here, learn lesson obeying!” “Well, I wish I alongside him,” said Tom. “If I cannot Rugby, I want work world, dawdling away three years Oxford.” “What mean 'at work world'?” said master, pausing lips close saucerful tea, peering Tom it. “Well, I mean real work--one's profession--whatever one really make one's living by. I want real good, feeling I play world,” answered Tom, rather puzzled find really mean. “You mixing two different things head, I think, Brown,” said master, putting empty saucer, “and ought get clear them. You talk 'working get living,' 'doing real good world,' breath. Now, may getting good living profession, yet good world, quite contrary, time. Keep latter one object, right, whether make living not; dwell other, likely drop mere money-making, let world take care good evil. Do hurry finding work world yourself--you old enough judge yet; look place find in, try make things little better honester there. You find plenty keep hand Oxford, wherever else go. And led away think part world important unimportant. Every corner world important. No man knows whether part so, every man may honest work corner.” And good man went talk wisely Tom sort work might take undergraduate, warned prevalent university sins, explained many great differences university school life, till twilight changed darkness, heard truant servants stealing back entrance. “I wonder Arthur be,” said Tom last, looking watch; “why, nearly half-past nine already.” “Oh, comfortably supper eleven, forgetful oldest friends,” said master. “Nothing given greater pleasure,” went on, “than friendship him; making both.” “Of me, rate,” answered Tom; “I never him. It luckiest chance world sent Rugby made chum.” “Why talk lucky chances?” said master. “I know things world; rate, neither luck chance matter.” Tom looked inquiringly, went on. “Do remember Doctor lectured East end one half-year, will, getting sorts scrapes?” “Yes, well enough,” said Tom; “it half-year Arthur came.” “Exactly so,” answered master. “Now, I minutes afterwards, great distress two. And talk, agreed particular wanted object School beyond games mischief; quite clear never would make regular school work first object. And Doctor, beginning next half-year, looked best new boys, separated East, put young boy study, hope somebody lean you, would begin stand little steadier yourself, get manliness thoughtfulness. And I assure watched experiment ever since great satisfaction. Ah! one boys ever know anxiety given him, care watched every step school lives.” Up time Tom never given wholly understood Doctor. At first thoroughly feared him. For years, I tried show, learnt regard love respect, think great wise good man. But regarded position School, little proud, Tom idea giving one credit himself, and, truth tell, self-conceited young gentleman subject. He boast fought way fairly School, never made taken big fellow master, quite different place first came. And, indeed, though actually boast it, yet secret soul great extent believe great reform School owing quite much one else. Arthur, acknowledged, done good, taught good deal; boys different ways, means influence School general. And Doctor, why, splendid master; every one knew masters could little school hours. In short, felt terms equality chief, far social state School concerned, thought Doctor would find easy matter get without him. Moreover, School Toryism still strong, looked still jealousy Doctor, somewhat fanatic matter change, thought desirable School wise person (such himself) look sharply vested School-rights, see nothing done injury republic without due protest. It new light find that, besides teaching sixth, governing guiding whole School, editing classics, writing histories, great headmaster found time busy years watch career even him, Tom Brown, particular friends, and, doubt, fifty boys time, without taking least credit himself, seeming know, let one else know, ever thought particularly boy all. However, Doctor's victory complete moment Tom Brown rate. He gave way points, enemy marched right him--cavalry, infantry, artillery, land transport corps, camp followers. It taken eight long years it; done thoroughly, corner left believe Doctor. Had returned School again, Doctor begun half-year abolishing fagging, football, Saturday half-holiday, cherished School institutions, Tom would supported blindest faith. And so, half confession previous shortcomings, sorrowful adieus tutor, received two beautifully-bound volumes Doctor's sermons, parting present, marched Schoolhouse, hero-worshipper, would satisfied soul Thomas Carlyle himself. There found eleven high jinks supper, Jack Raggles shouting comic songs performing feats strength, greeted chorus mingled remonstrance desertion joy reappearance. And falling humour evening, soon great boy rest; ten clock chaired round quadrangle, one hall benches, borne aloft eleven, shouting chorus, “For jolly good fellow,” old Thomas, melting mood, School-house servants, stood looking on. And next morning breakfast squared cricketing accounts, went round tradesmen acquaintance, said hearty good-byes; twelve clock train, away London, longer school-boy, divided thoughts hero-worship, honest regrets long stage life slipping sight behind him, hopes resolves next stage upon entering confidence young traveller. CHAPTER IX--FINIS. “Strange friend, past, present, be; Loved deeplier, darklier understood; Behold I dream dream good, And mingle world thee.”--TENNYSON. In summer 1842, hero stopped well-known station; leaving bag fishing-rod porter, walked slowly sadly towards town. It July. He rushed away Oxford moment term over, fishing ramble Scotland two college friends, three weeks living oatcake, mutton-hams, whisky, wildest parts Skye. They descended one sultry evening little inn Kyle Rhea ferry; Tom another party put tackle together began exploring stream sea-trout supper, third strolled house arrange entertainment. Presently came loose blouse slippers, short pipe mouth, old newspaper hand, threw heathery scrub met shingle, within easy hail fishermen. There lay, picture free-and-easy, loafing, hand-to-mouth young England, “improving mind,” shouted them, perusal fortnight-old weekly paper, soiled marks toddy-glasses tobacco-ashes, legacy last traveller, hunted kitchen little hostelry, and, youth communicative turn mind, began imparting contents fishermen went on. “What bother making wretched corn-laws! Here three four columns full nothing sliding scales fixed duties. Hang tobacco, always going out! Ah, something better--a splendid match Kent England, Brown, Kent winning three wickets. Felix fifty-six runs without chance, out!” Tom, intent fish risen twice, answered grunt. “Anything Goodwood?” called third man. “Rory O'More drawn. Butterfly colt amiss,” shouted student. “Just luck,” grumbled inquirer, jerking flies water, throwing heavy, sullen splash, frightening Tom's fish. “I say, cannot throw lighter there? We fishing grampuses,” shouted Tom across stream. “Hullo, Brown! something you,” called reading man next moment. “Why, old master, Arnold Rugby, dead.” Tom's hand stopped half-way cast, line flies went tangling round round rod; might knocked feather. Neither companions took notice him, luckily; violent effort set work mechanically disentangle line. He felt completely carried moral intellectual legs, lost standing-point invisible world. Besides which, deep, loving loyalty felt old leader made shock intensely painful. It first great wrench life, first gap angel Death made circle, felt numbed, beaten down, spiritless. Well, well! I believe good many others like case, learn loss soul man cannot stand lean upon human prop, however strong, wise, good; He upon alone stand lean knock away props His wise merciful way, ground stay left Himself, Rock Ages, upon alone sure foundation every soul man laid. As wearily laboured line, thought struck him, “It may false--a mere newspaper lie.” And strode recumbent smoker. “Let look paper,” said he. “Nothing else it,” answered other, handing listlessly. “Hullo, Brown! matter, old fellow? Are well?” “Where it?” said Tom, turning leaves, hands trembling, eyes swimming, could read. “What? What looking for?” said friend, jumping looking shoulder. “That--about Arnold,” said Tom. “Oh, here,” said other, putting finger paragraph. Tom read again. There could mistake identity, though account short enough. “Thank you,” said last, dropping paper. “I shall go walk. Do Herbert wait supper me.” And away strode, moor back house, alone, master grief possible. His friend looked him, sympathizing wondering, and, knocking ashes pipe, walked Herbert. After short parley walked together house. “I afraid confounded newspaper spoiled Brown's fun trip.” “How odd fond old master,” said Herbert. Yet also public-school men. The two, however, notwithstanding Tom's prohibition, waited supper him, everything ready came back half hour afterwards. But could join cheerful talk, party soon silent, notwithstanding efforts three. One thing Tom resolved, was, could stay Scotland longer: felt irresistible longing get Rugby, home, soon broke others, much tact oppose. So daylight next morning marching Ross-shire, evening hit Caledonian Canal, took next steamer, travelled fast boat railway could carry Rugby station. As walked town, felt shy afraid seen, took back streets--why, know, followed instinct. At School-gates made dead pause; soul quadrangle--all lonely, silent, sad. So another effort strode quadrangle, School-house offices. He found little matron room deep mourning; shook hand, tried talk, moved nervously about. She evidently thinking subject he, could begin talking. “Where shall I find Thomas?” said last, getting desperate. “In servants' hall, I think, sir. But take anything?” said matron, looking rather disappointed. “No, thank you,” said he, strode find old verger, sitting little den, old, puzzling hieroglyphics. He looked spectacles Tom seized hand wrung it. “Ah! heard it, sir, I see,” said he. Tom nodded, sat shoe-board, old man told tale, wiped spectacles, fairly flowed quaint, homely, honest sorrow. By time done Tom felt much better. “Where buried, Thomas?” said last. “Under altar chapel, sir,” answered Thomas. “You would like key, I dare say?” “Thank you, Thomas--yes, I should, much.” And old man fumbled among bunch, got up, though would go him; steps stopped short, said, “Perhaps would like go yourself, sir?” Tom nodded, bunch keys handed him, injunction sure lock door him, bring back eight clock. He walked quickly quadrangle close. The longing upon driven thus far, like gad-fly Greek legends, giving rest mind body, seemed sudden satisfied, shrivel pall. “Why I go on? It use,” thought, threw full length turf, looked vaguely listlessly well-known objects. There town boys playing cricket, wicket pitched best piece middle big-side ground--a sin equal sacrilege eyes captain eleven. He nearly getting go send off. “Pshaw! remember me. They right I,” muttered. And thought sceptre departed, mark wearing out, came home first time, bitterly enough. He lying spot fights came off--where fought six years ago first last battle. He conjured scene till could almost hear shouts ring, East's whisper ear; looking across close Doctor's private door, half expected see open, tall figure cap gown come striding elm-trees towards him. No, no; sight could never seen again. There flag flying round tower; School-house windows shuttered up; flag went again, shutters came down, would welcome stranger. All left earth honoured lying cold still chapel floor. He would go see place more, leave all. New men new methods might people; let would, worship rising star; he, least, would faithful sun set. And got up, walked chapel door, unlocked it, fancying mourner broad land, feeding selfish sorrow. He passed vestibule, paused moment glance empty benches. His heart still proud high, walked seat last occupied sixth-form boy, sat collect thoughts. And, truth tell, needed collecting setting order little. The memories eight years dancing brain, carrying whither would; while, beneath all, heart throbbing dull sense loss could never made him. The rays evening sun came solemnly painted windows head, fell gorgeous colours opposite wall, perfect stillness soothed spirit little little. And turned pulpit, looked it, then, leaning forward head hands, groaned aloud. If could seen Doctor one five minutes--have told heart, owed him, loved reverenced him, would, God's help, follow steps life death--he could borne without murmur. But gone away ever without knowing all, much bear. “But I sure know all?” The thought made start. “May even near me, chapel? If be, I sorrowing would sorrow, I wish sorrowed I shall meet again?” He raised looked round, minute rose walked humbly lowest bench, sat seat occupied first Sunday Rugby. And old memories rushed back again, softened subdued, soothing let carried away them. And looked great painted window altar, remembered how, little boy, used try look elm-trees rooks, painted glass came; subscription painted glass, letter wrote home money give it. And there, below, name boy sat right hand first day, scratched rudely oak panelling. And came thought old schoolfellows; form form boys nobler, braver, purer rose seemed rebuke him. Could think them, felt feeling--they honoured loved first man taken years know love? Could think yet dearer gone, bore name shared blood, without husband father? Then grief began share others became gentle holy, rose more, walked steps altar, tears flowed freely cheeks, knelt humbly hopefully, lay share burden proved heavy bear strength. Here let us leave him. Where better could leave altar first caught glimpse glory birthright, felt drawing bond links living souls together one brotherhood--at grave beneath altar opened eyes see glory, softened heart till could feel bond? And let us hard him, moment soul fuller tomb lies altar Him speaks. Such stages gone through, I believe, young brave souls, must win way hero-worship worship Him King Lord heroes. For mysterious human relationships--through love tenderness purity mothers sisters wives, strength courage wisdom fathers brothers teachers--that come knowledge Him alone love, tenderness, purity, strength, courage, wisdom dwell ever ever perfect fullness.
