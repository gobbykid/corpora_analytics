The four young faces firelight shone brightened cheerful words, darkened Jo said sadly, “We got Father, shall long time.” She say “perhaps never,” silently added it, thinking Father far away, fighting was. Nobody spoke minute; Meg said altered tone, “You know reason Mother proposed presents Christmas going hard winter everyone; thinks ought spend money pleasure, men suffering army. We cannot much, make little sacrifices, ought gladly. But I afraid I not,” Meg shook head, thought regretfully pretty things wanted. “But I think little spend would good. We got dollar, army would much helped giving that. I agree expect anything Mother you, I want buy _Undine Sintran_ myself.

It makes cross, hands get stiff, I cannot practice well all.” And Beth looked rough hands sigh one could hear time. “I believe suffer I do,” cried Amy, “for go school impertinent girls, plague know lessons, laugh dresses, label father rich, insult nose nice.” “If mean libel, I would say so, talk labels, Papa pickle bottle,” advised Jo, laughing. “I know I mean, need statirical it. It proper use good words, improve vocabilary,” returned Amy, dignity. “Do peck one another, children. Do wish money Papa lost little, Jo? Dear me! How happy good would be, worries!” said Meg, could remember better times. “You said day thought deal happier King children, fighting fretting time, spite money.” “So I did, Beth. Well, I think are. For though work, make fun ourselves, pretty jolly set, Jo would say.” “Jo use slang words!” observed Amy, reproving look long figure stretched rug. Jo immediately sat up, put hands pockets, began whistle. “Do not, Jo. It boyish!” “That I it.” “I detest rude, unladylike girls!” “I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!” “Birds little nests agree,” sang Beth, peacemaker, funny face sharp voices softened laugh, “pecking” ended time. “Really, girls, blamed,” said Meg, beginning lecture elder-sisterly fashion. “You old enough leave boyish tricks, behave better, Josephine. It matter much little girl, tall, turn hair, remember young lady.” “I not! And turning hair makes one, I wear two tails till I twenty,” cried Jo, pulling net, shaking chestnut mane. “I hate think I got grow up, Miss March, wear long gowns, look prim China Aster! It bad enough girl, anyway, I like boy’s games work manners! I cannot get disappointment boy. And worse ever now, I dying go fight Papa. And I stay home knit, like poky old woman!” And Jo shook blue army sock till needles rattled like castanets, ball bounded across room. “Poor Jo! It bad, cannot helped. So must try contented making name boyish, playing brother us girls,” said Beth, stroking rough head hand dish washing dusting world could make ungentle touch. “As you, Amy,” continued Meg, “you altogether particular prim. Your airs funny now, grow affected little goose, take care. I like nice manners refined ways speaking, try elegant. But absurd words bad Jo’s slang.” “If Jo tomboy Amy goose, I, please?” asked Beth, ready share lecture. “You dear, nothing else,” answered Meg warmly, one contradicted her, ‘Mouse’ pet family. As young readers like know ‘how people look’, take moment give little sketch four sisters, sat knitting away twilight, December snow fell quietly without, fire crackled cheerfully within. It comfortable room, though carpet faded furniture plain, good picture two hung walls, books filled recesses, chrysanthemums Christmas roses bloomed windows, pleasant atmosphere home peace pervaded it. Margaret, eldest four, sixteen, pretty, plump fair, large eyes, plenty soft brown hair, sweet mouth, white hands, rather vain. Fifteen-year-old Jo tall, thin, brown, reminded one colt, never seemed know long limbs, much way. She decided mouth, comical nose, sharp, gray eyes, appeared see everything, turns fierce, funny, thoughtful. Her long, thick hair one beauty, usually bundled net, way. Round shoulders Jo, big hands feet, flyaway look clothes, uncomfortable appearance girl rapidly shooting woman like it.

Her father called ‘Little Miss Tranquility’, name suited excellently, seemed live happy world own, venturing meet trusted loved. Amy, though youngest, important person, opinion least. A regular snow maiden, blue eyes, yellow hair curling shoulders, pale slender, always carrying like young lady mindful manners. What characters four sisters leave found out. The clock struck six and, swept hearth, Beth put pair slippers warm. Somehow sight old shoes good effect upon girls, Mother coming, everyone brightened welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, lighted lamp, Amy got easy chair without asked, Jo forgot tired sat hold slippers nearer blaze. “They quite worn out. Marmee must new pair.” “I thought I would get dollar,” said Beth. “No, I shall!” cried Amy. “I oldest,” began Meg, Jo cut decided, “I man family Papa away, I shall provide slippers, told take special care Mother gone.” “I tell do,” said Beth, “let us get something Christmas, get anything ourselves.” “That like you, dear!

You best actress got, end everything quit boards,” said Jo. “We ought rehearse tonight. Come here, Amy, fainting scene, stiff poker that.” “I cannot help it. I never saw anyone faint, I choose make black blue, tumbling flat do. If I go easily, I drop. If I cannot, I shall fall chair graceful. I care Hugo come pistol,” returned Amy, gifted dramatic power, chosen small enough borne shrieking villain piece. “Do way. Clasp hands so, stagger across room, crying frantically, ‘Roderigo! Save me! Save me!’” away went Jo, melodramatic scream truly thrilling. Amy followed, poked hands stiffly her, jerked along went machinery, “Ow!” suggestive pins run fear anguish. Jo gave despairing groan, Meg laughed outright, Beth let bread burn watched fun interest. “It use! Do best time comes, audience laughs, blame me. Come on, Meg.” Then things went smoothly, Don Pedro defied world speech two pages without single break. Hagar, witch, chanted awful incantation kettleful simmering toads, weird effect. Roderigo rent chains asunder manfully, Hugo died agonies remorse arsenic, wild, “Ha! Ha!” “It best yet,” said Meg, dead villain sat rubbed elbows. “I see write act splendid things, Jo. You regular Shakespeare!” exclaimed Beth, firmly believed sisters gifted wonderful genius things. “Not quite,” replied Jo modestly. “I think _The Witches Curse, Operatic Tragedy_ rather nice thing, I would like try _Macbeth_, trapdoor Banquo. I always wanted killing part. ‘Is dagger I see me?” muttered Jo, rolling eyes clutching air, seen famous tragedian do. “No, toasting fork, Mother’s shoe instead bread. Beth’s stage-struck!” cried Meg, rehearsal ended general burst laughter. “Glad find merry, girls,” said cheery voice door, actors audience turned welcome tall, motherly lady ‘can I help you’ look truly delightful. She elegantly dressed, noble-looking woman, girls thought gray cloak unfashionable bonnet covered splendid mother world. “Well, dearies, got today? There much do, getting boxes ready go tomorrow, I come home dinner. Has anyone called, Beth? How cold, Meg? Jo, look tired death. Come kiss me, baby.” While making maternal inquiries Mrs. March got wet things off, warm slippers on, sitting easy chair, drew Amy lap, preparing enjoy happiest hour busy day. The girls flew about, trying make things comfortable, way. Meg arranged tea table, Jo brought wood set chairs, dropping, over-turning, clattering everything touched. Beth trotted fro parlor kitchen, quiet busy, Amy gave directions everyone, sat hands folded. As gathered table, Mrs. March said, particularly happy face, “I got treat supper.” A quick, bright smile went round like streak sunshine. Beth clapped hands, regardless biscuit held, Jo tossed napkin, crying, “A letter! A letter! Three cheers Father!” “Yes, nice long letter. He well, thinks shall get cold season better feared. He sends sorts loving wishes Christmas, especial message girls,” said Mrs. March, patting pocket got treasure there. “Hurry get done! Do stop quirk little finger simper plate, Amy,” cried Jo, choking tea dropping bread, butter side down, carpet haste get treat. Beth ate more, crept away sit shadowy corner brood delight come, till others ready. “I think splendid Father go chaplain old drafted, strong enough soldier,” said Meg warmly. “Do I wish I could go drummer, vivan—what name? Or nurse, I could near help him,” exclaimed Jo, groan. “It must disagreeable sleep tent, eat sorts bad-tasting things, drink tin mug,” sighed Amy. “When come home, Marmee?” asked Beth, little quiver voice. “Not many months, dear, unless sick. He stay work faithfully long can, ask back minute sooner spared. Now come hear letter.” They drew fire, Mother big chair Beth feet, Meg Amy perched either arm chair, Jo leaning back, one would see sign emotion letter happen touching. Very letters written hard times touching, especially fathers sent home. In one little said hardships endured, dangers faced, homesickness conquered. It cheerful, hopeful letter, full lively descriptions camp life, marches, military news, end writer’s heart over-flow fatherly love longing little girls home. “Give dear love kiss. Tell I think day, pray night, find best comfort affection times. A year seems long wait I see them, remind wait may work, hard days need wasted. I know remember I said them, loving children you, duty faithfully, fight bosom enemies bravely, conquer beautifully I come back I may fonder prouder ever little women.” Everybody sniffed came part. Jo ashamed great tear dropped end nose, Amy never minded rumpling curls hid face mother’s shoulder sobbed out, “I selfish girl! But I truly try better, may disappointed by-and-by.” “We will,” cried Meg. “I think much looks hate work, more, I help it.” “I try loves call me, ‘a little woman’ rough wild, duty instead wanting somewhere else,” said Jo, thinking keeping temper home much harder task facing rebel two South. Beth said nothing, wiped away tears blue army sock began knit might, losing time duty lay nearest her, resolved quiet little soul Father hoped find year brought round happy coming home. Mrs. March broke silence followed Jo’s words, saying cheery voice, “Do remember used play Pilgrims Progress little things? Nothing delighted tie piece bags backs burdens, give hats sticks rolls paper, let travel house cellar, City Destruction, up, up, housetop, lovely things could collect make Celestial City.” “What fun was, especially going lions, fighting Apollyon, passing valley hob-goblins were,” said Jo. “I liked place bundles fell tumbled downstairs,” said Meg. “I remember much it, except I afraid cellar dark entry, always liked cake milk top. If I old things, I would rather like play again,” said Amy, began talk renouncing childish things mature age twelve. “We never old this, dear, play playing time one way another. Our burdens here, road us, longing goodness happiness guide leads us many troubles mistakes peace true Celestial City. Now, little pilgrims, suppose begin again, play, earnest, see far get Father comes home.” “Really, Mother? Where bundles?” asked Amy, literal young lady. “Each told burden now, except Beth. I rather think got any,” said mother. “Yes, I have. Mine dishes dusters, envying girls nice pianos, afraid people.” Beth’s bundle funny one everybody wanted laugh, nobody did, would hurt feelings much. “Let us it,” said Meg thoughtfully. “It another name trying good, story may help us, though want good, hard work forget, best.” “We Slough Despond tonight, Mother came pulled us Help book. We ought roll directions, like Christian. What shall that?” asked Jo, delighted fancy lent little romance dull task duty. “Look pillows Christmas morning, find guidebook,” replied Mrs. March. They talked new plan old Hannah cleared table, came four little work baskets, needles flew girls made sheets Aunt March. It uninteresting sewing, tonight one grumbled. They adopted Jo’s plan dividing long seams four parts, calling quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, America, way got capitally, especially talked different countries stitched way them. At nine stopped work, sang, usual, went bed. No one Beth could get much music old piano, way softly touching yellow keys making pleasant accompaniment simple songs sang. Meg voice like flute, mother led little choir. Amy chirped like cricket, Jo wandered airs sweet will, always coming wrong place croak quaver spoiled pensive tune. They always done time could lisp... Crinkle, crinkle, ’ittle ’tar, become household custom, mother born singer. The first sound morning voice went house singing like lark, last sound night cheery sound, girls never grew old familiar lullaby. CHAPTER TWO A MERRY CHRISTMAS Jo first wake gray dawn Christmas morning. No stockings hung fireplace, moment felt much disappointed long ago, little sock fell crammed full goodies. Then remembered mother’s promise and, slipping hand pillow, drew little crimson-covered book. She knew well, beautiful old story best life ever lived, Jo felt true guidebook pilgrim going long journey. She woke Meg “Merry Christmas,” bade see pillow. A green-covered book appeared, picture inside, words written mother, made one present precious eyes. Presently Beth Amy woke rummage find little books also, one dove-colored, blue, sat looking talking them, east grew rosy coming day. In spite small vanities, Margaret sweet pious nature, unconsciously influenced sisters, especially Jo, loved tenderly, obeyed advice gently given. “Girls,” said Meg seriously, looking tumbled head beside two little night-capped ones room beyond, “Mother wants us read love mind books, must begin once. We used faithful it, since Father went away war trouble unsettled us, neglected many things. You please, I shall keep book table read little every morning soon I wake, I know good help day.” Then opened new book began read. Jo put arm round and, leaning cheek cheek, read also, quiet expression seldom seen restless face. “How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let us do. I help hard words, explain things understand,” whispered Beth, much impressed pretty books sisters’ example. “I glad mine blue,” said Amy. rooms still pages softly turned, winter sunshine crept touch bright heads serious faces Christmas greeting. “Where Mother?” asked Meg, Jo ran thank gifts, half hour later. “Goodness knows. Some poor creeter came a-beggin’, went straight see needed. There never woman givin’ away vittles drink, clothes firin’,” replied Hannah, lived family since Meg born, considered friend servant. “She back soon, I think, fry cakes, everything ready,” said Meg, looking presents collected basket kept sofa, ready produced proper time. “Why, Amy’s bottle cologne?” added, little flask appear. “She took minute ago, went put ribbon it, notion,” replied Jo, dancing room take first stiffness new army slippers. “How nice handkerchiefs look, they? Hannah washed ironed me, I marked myself,” said Beth, looking proudly somewhat uneven letters cost labor. “Bless child! She gone put ‘Mother’ instead ‘M. March’. How funny!” cried Jo, taking one up. “Is right? I thought better so, Meg’s initials M.M., I want anyone use Marmee,” said Beth, looking troubled. “It right, dear, pretty idea, quite sensible too, one ever mistake now. It please much, I know,” said Meg, frown Jo smile Beth. “There Mother. Hide basket, quick!” cried Jo, door slammed steps sounded hall. Amy came hastily, looked rather abashed saw sisters waiting her. “Where been, hiding behind you?” asked Meg, surprised see, hood cloak, lazy Amy early. “Do laugh me, Jo! I mean anyone know till time came. I meant change little bottle big one, I gave money get it, I truly trying selfish more.” As spoke, Amy showed handsome flask replaced cheap one, looked earnest humble little effort forget Meg hugged spot, Jo pronounced ‘a trump’, Beth ran window, picked finest rose ornament stately bottle. “You see I felt ashamed present, reading talking good morning, I ran round corner changed minute I up, I glad, mine handsomest now.” Another bang street door sent basket sofa, girls table, eager breakfast. “Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many them! Thank books. We read some, mean every day,” cried chorus. “Merry Christmas, little daughters! I glad began once, hope keep on. But I want say one word sit down. Not far away lies poor woman little newborn baby. Six children huddled one bed keep freezing, fire. There nothing eat there, oldest boy came tell suffering hunger cold. My girls, give breakfast Christmas present?” They unusually hungry, waited nearly hour, minute one spoke, minute, Jo exclaimed impetuously, “I glad came began!” “May I go help carry things poor little children?” asked Beth eagerly. “I shall take cream muffings,” added Amy, heroically giving article liked. Meg already covering buckwheats, piling bread one big plate. “I thought would it,” said Mrs. March, smiling satisfied. “You shall go help me, come back bread milk breakfast, make dinnertime.” They soon ready, procession set out. Fortunately early, went back streets, people saw them, one laughed queer party. A poor, bare, miserable room was, broken windows, fire, ragged bedclothes, sick mother, wailing baby, group pale, hungry children cuddled one old quilt, trying keep warm. How big eyes stared blue lips smiled girls went in. “Ach, mein Gott! It good angels come us!” said poor woman, crying joy. “Funny angels hoods mittens,” said Jo, set laughing. In minutes really seem kind spirits work there. Hannah, carried wood, made fire, stopped broken panes old hats cloak. Mrs. March gave mother tea gruel, comforted promises help, dressed little baby tenderly own. The girls meantime spread table, set children round fire, fed like many hungry birds, laughing, talking, trying understand funny broken English. “Das ist gut!” “Die Engel-kinder!” cried poor things ate warmed purple hands comfortable blaze. The girls never called angel children before, thought agreeable, especially Jo, considered ‘Sancho’ ever since born. That happy breakfast, though get it. And went away, leaving comfort behind, I think city four merrier people hungry little girls gave away breakfasts contented bread milk Christmas morning. “That loving neighbor better ourselves, I like it,” said Meg, set presents mother upstairs collecting clothes poor Hummels. Not splendid show, great deal love done little bundles, tall vase red roses, white chrysanthemums, trailing vines, stood middle, gave quite elegant air table. “She coming! Strike up, Beth! Open door, Amy! Three cheers Marmee!” cried Jo, prancing Meg went conduct Mother seat honor. Beth played gayest march, Amy threw open door, Meg enacted escort great dignity. Mrs. March surprised touched, smiled eyes full examined presents read little notes accompanied them. The slippers went once, new handkerchief slipped pocket, well scented Amy’s cologne, rose fastened bosom, nice gloves pronounced perfect fit. There good deal laughing kissing explaining, simple, loving fashion makes home festivals pleasant time, sweet remember long afterward, fell work. The morning charities ceremonies took much time rest day devoted preparations evening festivities. Being still young go often theater, rich enough afford great outlay private performances, girls put wits work, necessity mother invention, made whatever needed. Very clever productions, pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made old-fashioned butter boats covered silver paper, gorgeous robes old cotton, glittering tin spangles pickle factory, armor covered useful diamond shaped bits left sheets lids preserve pots cut out. The big chamber scene many innocent revels. No gentleman admitted, Jo played male parts heart’s content took immense satisfaction pair russet leather boots given friend, knew lady knew actor. These boots, old foil, slashed doublet used artist picture, Jo’s chief treasures appeared occasions. The smallness company made necessary two principal actors take several parts apiece, certainly deserved credit hard work learning three four different parts, whisking various costumes, managing stage besides. It excellent drill memories, harmless amusement, employed many hours otherwise would idle, lonely, spent less profitable society. On Christmas night, dozen girls piled onto bed dress circle, sat blue yellow chintz curtains flattering state expectancy. There good deal rustling whispering behind curtain, trifle lamp smoke, occasional giggle Amy, apt get hysterical excitement moment. Presently bell sounded, curtains flew apart, _operatic tragedy_ began. “A gloomy wood,” according one playbill, represented shrubs pots, green baize floor, cave distance. This cave made clothes horse roof, bureaus walls, small furnace full blast, black pot old witch bending it. The stage dark glow furnace fine effect, especially real steam issued kettle witch took cover. A moment allowed first thrill subside, Hugo, villain, stalked clanking sword side, slouching hat, black beard, mysterious cloak, boots. After pacing fro much agitation, struck forehead, burst wild strain, singing hatred Roderigo, love Zara, pleasing resolution kill one win other. The gruff tones Hugo’s voice, occasional shout feelings overcame him, impressive, audience applauded moment paused breath. Bowing air one accustomed public praise, stole cavern ordered Hagar come forth commanding, “What ho, minion! I need thee!” Out came Meg, gray horsehair hanging face, red black robe, staff, cabalistic signs upon cloak. Hugo demanded potion make Zara adore him, one destroy Roderigo. Hagar, fine dramatic melody, promised both, proceeded call spirit would bring love philter. Hither, hither, thy home, Airy sprite, I bid thee come! Born roses, fed dew, Charms potions canst thou brew? Bring here, elfin speed, The fragrant philter I need. Make sweet swift strong, Spirit, answer song! A soft strain music sounded, back cave appeared little figure cloudy white, glittering wings, golden hair, garland roses head. Waving wand, sang... Hither I come, From airy home, Afar silver moon. Take magic spell, And use well, Or power vanish soon! And dropping small, gilded bottle witch’s feet, spirit vanished. Another chant Hagar produced another apparition, lovely one, bang ugly black imp appeared and, croaked reply, tossed dark bottle Hugo disappeared mocking laugh. Having warbled thanks put potions boots, Hugo departed, Hagar informed audience killed friends times past, cursed him, intends thwart plans, revenged him. Then curtain fell, audience reposed ate candy discussing merits play. A good deal hammering went curtain rose again, became evident masterpiece stage carpentery got up, one murmured delay. It truly superb. A tower rose ceiling, halfway appeared window lamp burning it, behind white curtain appeared Zara lovely blue silver dress, waiting Roderigo. He came gorgeous array, plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, guitar, boots, course. Kneeling foot tower, sang serenade melting tones. Zara replied and, musical dialogue, consented fly. Then came grand effect play. Roderigo produced rope ladder, five steps it, threw one end, invited Zara descend. Timidly crept lattice, put hand Roderigo’s shoulder, leap gracefully “Alas! Alas Zara!” forgot train. It caught window, tower tottered, leaned forward, fell crash, buried unhappy lovers ruins. A universal shriek arose russet boots waved wildly wreck golden head emerged, exclaiming, “I told so! I told so!” With wonderful presence mind, Don Pedro, cruel sire, rushed in, dragged daughter, hasty aside... “Do laugh! Act right!” and, ordering Roderigo up, banished kingdom wrath scorn. Though decidedly shaken fall tower upon him, Roderigo defied old gentleman refused stir. This dauntless example fired Zara. She also defied sire, ordered deepest dungeons castle. A stout little retainer came chains led away, looking much frightened evidently forgetting speech ought made. Act third castle hall, Hagar appeared, come free lovers finish Hugo. She hears coming hides, sees put potions two cups wine bid timid little servant, “Bear captives cells, tell I shall come anon.” The servant takes Hugo aside tell something, Hagar changes cups two others harmless. Ferdinando, ‘minion’, carries away, Hagar puts back cup holds poison meant Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty long warble, drinks it, loses wits, good deal clutching stamping, falls flat dies, Hagar informs done song exquisite power melody. This truly thrilling scene, though persons might thought sudden tumbling quantity long red hair rather marred effect villain’s death. He called curtain, great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing considered wonderful rest performance put together. Act fourth displayed despairing Roderigo point stabbing told Zara deserted him. Just dagger heart, lovely song sung window, informing Zara true danger, save will. A key thrown in, unlocks door, spasm rapture tears chains rushes away find rescue lady love. Act fifth opened stormy scene Zara Don Pedro. He wishes go convent, hear it, touching appeal, faint Roderigo dashes demands hand. Don Pedro refuses, rich. They shout gesticulate tremendously cannot agree, Rodrigo bear away exhausted Zara, timid servant enters letter bag Hagar, mysteriously disappeared. The latter informs party bequeaths untold wealth young pair awful doom Don Pedro, make happy. The bag opened, several quarts tin money shower upon stage till quite glorified glitter. This entirely softens stern sire. He consents without murmur, join joyful chorus, curtain falls upon lovers kneeling receive Don Pedro’s blessing attitudes romantic grace. Tumultuous applause followed received unexpected check, cot bed, dress circle built, suddenly shut extinguished enthusiastic audience. Roderigo Don Pedro flew rescue, taken unhurt, though many speechless laughter. The excitement hardly subsided Hannah appeared, “Mrs. March’s compliments, would ladies walk supper.” This surprise even actors, saw table, looked one another rapturous amazement. It like Marmee get little treat them, anything fine unheard since departed days plenty. There ice cream, actually two dishes it, pink white, cake fruit distracting French bonbons and, middle table, four great bouquets hot house flowers. It quite took breath away, stared first table mother, looked enjoyed immensely. “Is fairies?” asked Amy. “Santa Claus,” said Beth. “Mother it.” And Meg smiled sweetest, spite gray beard white eyebrows. “Aunt March good fit sent supper,” cried Jo, sudden inspiration. “All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it,” replied Mrs. March. “The Laurence boy’s grandfather! What world put thing head? We know him!” exclaimed Meg. “Hannah told one servants breakfast party. He odd old gentleman, pleased him. He knew father years ago, sent polite note afternoon, saying hoped I would allow express friendly feeling toward children sending trifles honor day. I could refuse, little feast night make bread-and-milk breakfast.” “That boy put head, I know did! He capital fellow, I wish could get acquainted. He looks would like know us bashful, Meg prim let speak pass,” said Jo, plates went round, ice began melt sight, ohs ahs satisfaction. “You mean people live big house next door, you?” asked one girls. “My mother knows old Mr. Laurence, says proud like mix neighbors. He keeps grandson shut up, riding walking tutor, makes study hard. We invited party, come. Mother says nice, though never speaks us girls.” “Our cat ran away once, brought back, talked fence, getting capitally, cricket, on, saw Meg coming, walked off. I mean know day, needs fun, I sure does,” said Jo decidedly. “I like manners, looks like little gentleman, I objection knowing him, proper opportunity comes. He brought flowers himself, I asked in, I sure going upstairs. He looked wistful went away, hearing frolic evidently none own.” “It mercy not, Mother!” laughed Jo, looking boots. “But another play sometime see. Perhaps help act. Would jolly?” “I never fine bouquet before! How pretty is!” And Meg examined flowers great interest. “They lovely. But Beth’s roses sweeter me,” said Mrs. March, smelling half-dead posy belt. Beth nestled her, whispered softly, “I wish I could send bunch Father. I afraid merry Christmas are.” CHAPTER THREE THE LAURENCE BOY “Jo! Jo! Where you?” cried Meg foot garret stairs. “Here!” answered husky voice above, and, running up, Meg found sister eating apples crying Heir Redclyffe, wrapped comforter old three-legged sofa sunny window. This Jo’s favorite refuge, loved retire half dozen russets nice book, enjoy quiet society pet rat lived near mind particle. As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked hole. Jo shook tears cheeks waited hear news. “Such fun! Only see! A regular note invitation Mrs. Gardiner tomorrow night!” cried Meg, waving precious paper proceeding read girlish delight. “‘Mrs. Gardiner would happy see Miss March Miss Josephine little dance New Year’s Eve.’ Marmee willing go, shall wear?” “What use asking that, know shall wear poplins, got anything else?” answered Jo mouth full. “If I silk!” sighed Meg. “Mother says I may I eighteen perhaps, two years everlasting time wait.” “I sure pops look like silk, nice enough us. Yours good new, I forgot burn tear mine. Whatever shall I do? The burn shows badly, I cannot take out.” “You must sit still keep back sight. The front right. I shall new ribbon hair, Marmee lend little pearl pin, new slippers lovely, gloves do, though nice I would like.” “Mine spoiled lemonade, I cannot get new ones, I shall go without,” said Jo, never troubled much dress. “You must gloves, I go,” cried Meg decidedly. “Gloves important anything else.

She said spoiled others get winter. Cannot make do?” “I hold crumpled hand, one know stained are. That I do. No! I tell manage, wear one good one carry bad one. Do see?” “Your hands bigger mine, stretch glove dreadfully,” began Meg, whose gloves tender point her. “Then I go without. I care people say!” cried Jo, taking book. “You may it, may! Only stain it, behave nicely. Do put hands behind you, stare, say ‘Christopher Columbus!’ you?” “Do worry me. I prim I get scrapes, I help it.

On New Year’s Eve parlor deserted, two younger girls played dressing maids two elder absorbed all-important business ‘getting ready party’. Simple toilets were, great deal running down, laughing talking, one time strong smell burned hair pervaded house. Meg wanted curls face, Jo undertook pinch papered locks pair hot tongs. “Ought smoke like that?” asked Beth perch bed. “It dampness drying,” replied Jo. “What queer smell!

I seen many girls so,” said Amy consolingly. “Serves right trying fine. I wish I would let hair alone,” cried Meg petulantly. “So I, smooth pretty. But soon grow again,” said Beth, coming kiss comfort shorn sheep. After various lesser mishaps, Meg finished last, united exertions entire family Jo’s hair got dress on. They looked well simple suits, Meg’s silvery drab, blue velvet snood, lace frills, pearl pin. Jo maroon, stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, white chrysanthemum two ornament. Each put one nice light glove, carried one soiled one, pronounced effect “quite easy fine”. Meg’s high-heeled slippers tight hurt her, though would it, Jo’s nineteen hairpins seemed stuck straight head, exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us elegant die. “Have good time, dearies!” said Mrs. March, sisters went daintily walk. “Do eat much supper, come away eleven I send Hannah you.” As gate clashed behind them, voice cried window... “Girls, girls!

Meg knew Sallie ease soon, Jo, care much girls girlish gossip, stood about, back carefully wall, felt much place colt flower garden. Half dozen jovial lads talking skates another part room, longed go join them, skating one joys life. She telegraphed wish Meg, eyebrows went alarmingly dared stir. No one came talk her, one one group dwindled away till left alone. She could roam amuse herself, burned breadth would show, stared people rather forlornly till dancing began. Meg asked once, tight slippers tripped briskly none would guessed pain wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw big red headed youth approaching corner, fearing meant engage her, slipped curtained recess, intending peep enjoy peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person chosen refuge, for, curtain fell behind her, found face face ‘Laurence boy’. “Dear me, I know anyone here!” stammered Jo, preparing back speedily bounced in. But boy laughed said pleasantly, though looked little startled, “Do mind me, stay like.” “Shall I disturb you?” “Not bit. I came I know many people felt rather strange first, know.” “So I. Do go away, please, unless would rather.” The boy sat looked pumps, till Jo said, trying polite easy, “I think I pleasure seeing before. You live near us, you?” “Next door.” And looked laughed outright, Jo’s prim manner rather funny remembered chatted cricket brought cat home. That put Jo ease laughed too, said, heartiest way, “We good time nice Christmas present.” “Grandpa sent it.” “But put head, you, now?” “How cat, Miss March?” asked boy, trying look sober black eyes shone fun. “Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence. But I Miss March, I Jo,” returned young lady. “I Mr. Laurence, I Laurie.” “Laurie Laurence, odd name.” “My first name Theodore, I like it, fellows called Dora, I made say Laurie instead.” “I hate name, too, sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo instead Josephine. How make boys stop calling Dora?” “I thrashed them.” “I cannot thrash Aunt March, I suppose I shall bear it.” And Jo resigned sigh. “Do like dance, Miss Jo?” asked Laurie, looking thought name suited her. “I like well enough plenty room, everyone lively. In place like I sure upset something, tread people’s toes, something dreadful, I keep mischief let Meg sail about. Do dance?” “Sometimes. You see I abroad good many years, company enough yet know things here.” “Abroad!” cried Jo. “Oh, tell it! I love dearly hear people describe travels.” Laurie seem know begin, Jo’s eager questions soon set going, told school Vevay, boys never wore hats fleet boats lake, holiday fun went walking trips Switzerland teachers. “Do I wish I would there!” cried Jo. “Did go Paris?” “We spent last winter there.” “Can talk French?” “We allowed speak anything else Vevay.” “Do say some! I read it, cannot pronounce.” “Quel nom cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?” “How nicely it! Let see ... said, ‘Who young lady pretty slippers’, you?” “Oui, mademoiselle.” “It sister Margaret, knew was! Do think pretty?” “Yes, makes think German girls, looks fresh quiet, dances like lady.” Jo quite glowed pleasure boyish praise sister, stored repeat Meg. Both peeped criticized chatted till felt like old acquaintances. Laurie’s bashfulness soon wore off, Jo’s gentlemanly demeanor amused set ease, Jo merry self again, dress forgotten nobody lifted eyebrows her. She liked ‘Laurence boy’ better ever took several good looks him, might describe girls, brothers, male cousins, boys almost unknown creatures them. “Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine teeth, small hands feet, taller I am, polite, boy, altogether jolly. Wonder old is?” It tip Jo’s tongue ask, checked time and, unusual tact, tried find round-about way. “I suppose going college soon? I see pegging away books, no, I mean studying hard.” And Jo blushed dreadful ‘pegging’ escaped her. Laurie smiled seem shocked, answered shrug. “Not year two. I go seventeen, anyway.” “Are fifteen?” asked Jo, looking tall lad, imagined seventeen already. “Sixteen, next month.” “How I wish I going college! You look liked it.” “I hate it! Nothing grinding skylarking. And I like way fellows either, country.” “What like?” “To live Italy, enjoy way.” Jo wanted much ask way was, black brows looked rather threatening knit them, changed subject saying, foot kept time, “That splendid polka! Why go try it?” “If come too,” answered, gallant little bow. “I cannot, I told Meg I would not, because...” There Jo stopped, looked undecided whether tell laugh. “Because, what?” “You tell?” “Never!” “Well, I bad trick standing fire, I burn frocks, I scorched one, though nicely mended, shows, Meg told keep still one would see it. You may laugh, want to. It funny, I know.” But Laurie laugh. He looked minute, expression face puzzled Jo said gently, “Never mind that. I tell manage. There long hall there, dance grandly, one see us. Please come.” Jo thanked gladly went, wishing two neat gloves saw nice, pearl-colored ones partner wore. The hall empty, grand polka, Laurie danced well, taught German step, delighted Jo, full swing spring. When music stopped, sat stairs get breath, Laurie midst account students’ festival Heidelberg Meg appeared search sister. She beckoned, Jo reluctantly followed side room, found sofa, holding foot, looking pale. “I sprained ankle. That stupid high heel turned gave sad wrench. It aches so, I hardly stand, I know I ever going get home,” said, rocking fro pain. “I knew would hurt feet silly shoes. I sorry. But I see do, except get carriage, stay night,” answered Jo, softly rubbing poor ankle spoke. “I cannot carriage without costing ever much. I dare say I cannot get one all, people come own, long way stable, one send.” “I go.” “No, indeed! It past nine, dark Egypt. I cannot stop here, house full. Sallie girls staying her. I rest till Hannah comes, best I can.” “I ask Laurie. He go,” said Jo, looking relieved idea occurred her. “Mercy, no! Do ask tell anyone. Get rubbers, put slippers things. I cannot dance anymore, soon supper over, watch Hannah tell minute comes.” “They going supper now. I stay you. I would rather.” “No, dear, run along, bring coffee. I tired I cannot stir.” So Meg reclined, rubbers well hidden, Jo went blundering away dining room, found going china closet, opening door room old Mr. Gardiner taking little private refreshment. Making dart table, secured coffee, immediately spilled, thereby making front dress bad back. “Oh, dear, blunderbuss I am!” exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg’s glove scrubbing gown it. “Can I help you?” said friendly voice. And Laurie, full cup one hand plate ice other. “I trying get something Meg, tired, someone shook me, I nice state,” answered Jo, glancing dismally stained skirt coffee-colored glove. “Too bad! I looking someone give to. May I take sister?” “Oh, thank you! I show is. I offer take myself, I get another scrape I did.” Jo led way, used waiting ladies, Laurie drew little table, brought second installment coffee ice Jo, obliging even particular Meg pronounced ‘nice boy’. They merry time bonbons mottoes, midst quiet game _Buzz_, two three young people strayed in, Hannah appeared. Meg forgot foot rose quickly forced catch hold Jo, exclamation pain. “Hush! Do say anything,” whispered, adding aloud, “It nothing. I turned foot little, all,” limped upstairs put things on. Hannah scolded, Meg cried, Jo wits’ end, till decided take things hands. Slipping out, ran and, finding servant, asked could get carriage. It happened hired waiter knew nothing neighborhood Jo looking round help Laurie, heard said, came offered grandfather’s carriage, come him, said. “It early! You cannot mean go yet?” began Jo, looking relieved hesitating accept offer. “I always go early, I do, truly! Please let take home. It way, know, rains, say.” That settled it, telling Meg’s mishap, Jo gratefully accepted rushed bring rest party. Hannah hated rain much cat made trouble, rolled away luxurious close carriage, feeling festive elegant. Laurie went box Meg could keep foot up, girls talked party freedom. “I capital time. Did you?” asked Jo, rumpling hair, making comfortable. “Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie’s friend, Annie Moffat, took fancy me, asked come spend week Sallie does. She going spring opera comes, perfectly splendid, Mother let us go,” answered Meg, cheering thought. “I saw dancing red headed man I ran away from. Was nice?” “Oh, very! His hair auburn, red, polite, I delicious redowa him.” “He looked like grasshopper fit new step. Laurie I could help laughing. Did hear us?” “No, rude. What time, hidden away there?” Jo told adventures, time finished home. With many thanks, said good night crept in, hoping disturb one, instant door creaked, two little nightcaps bobbed up, two sleepy eager voices cried out... “Tell party! Tell party!” With Meg called ‘a great want manners’ Jo saved bonbons little girls, soon subsided, hearing thrilling events evening. “I declare, really seems like fine young lady, come home party carriage sit dressing gown maid wait me,” said Meg, Jo bound foot arnica brushed hair. “I believe fine young ladies enjoy bit do, spite burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece tight slippers sprain ankles silly enough wear them.” And I think Jo quite right. CHAPTER FOUR BURDENS “Oh, dear, hard seem take packs go on,” sighed Meg morning party, holidays over, week merrymaking fit going easily task never liked. “I wish Christmas New Year’s time. Would fun?” answered Jo, yawning dismally. “We enjoy half much now. But seem nice little suppers bouquets, go parties, drive home, read rest, work. It like people, know, I always envy girls things, I fond luxury,” said Meg, trying decide two shabby gowns least shabby. “Well, cannot it, let us grumble shoulder bundles trudge along cheerfully Marmee does. I sure Aunt March regular Old Man Sea me, I suppose I learned carry without complaining, tumble off, get light I shall mind her.” This idea tickled Jo’s fancy put good spirits, Meg brighten, burden, consisting four spoiled children, seemed heavier ever. She heart enough even make pretty usual putting blue neck ribbon dressing hair becoming way. “Where use looking nice, one sees cross midgets, one cares whether I pretty not?” muttered, shutting drawer jerk. “I shall toil moil days, little bits fun then, get old ugly sour, I poor cannot enjoy life girls do. It shame!” So Meg went down, wearing injured look, agreeable breakfast time. Everyone seemed rather sorts inclined croak. Beth headache lay sofa, trying comfort cat three kittens. Amy fretting lessons learned, could find rubbers. Jo would whistle make great racket getting ready. Mrs. March busy trying finish letter, must go once, Hannah grumps, late suit her. “There never cross family!” cried Jo, losing temper upset inkstand, broken boot lacings, sat upon hat. “You crossest person it!” returned Amy, washing sum wrong tears fallen slate. “Beth, keep horrid cats cellar I drowned,” exclaimed Meg angrily tried get rid kitten scrambled back stuck like burr reach. Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, Amy wailed could remember much nine times twelve was. “Girls, girls, quiet one minute! I must get early mail, drive distracted worry,” cried Mrs. March, crossing third spoiled sentence letter. There momentary lull, broken Hannah, stalked in, laid two hot turnovers table, stalked again. These turnovers institution, girls called ‘muffs’, others found hot pies comforting hands cold mornings. Hannah never forgot make them, matter busy grumpy might be, walk long bleak. The poor things got lunch seldom home two. “Cuddle cats get headache, Bethy. Goodbye, Marmee. We set rascals morning, come home regular angels. Now then, Meg!” And Jo tramped away, feeling pilgrims setting ought do. They always looked back turning corner, mother always window nod smile, wave hand them. Somehow seemed could got day without that, whatever mood might be, last glimpse motherly face sure affect like sunshine. “If Marmee shook fist instead kissing hand us, would serve us right, ungrateful wretches never seen,” cried Jo, taking remorseful satisfaction snowy walk bitter wind. “Do use dreadful expressions,” replied Meg depths veil shrouded like nun sick world. “I like good strong words mean something,” replied Jo, catching hat took leap head preparatory flying away altogether. “Call names like, I neither rascal wretch I choose called so.” “You blighted being, decidedly cross today cannot sit lap luxury time. Poor dear, wait till I make fortune, shall revel carriages ice cream high-heeled slippers, posies, red-headed boys dance with.” “How ridiculous are, Jo!” But Meg laughed nonsense felt better spite herself. “Lucky I am, I put crushed airs tried dismal, do, nice state. Thank goodness, I always find something funny keep up. Do croak more, come home jolly, dear.” Jo gave sister encouraging pat shoulder parted day, going different way, hugging little warm turnover, trying cheerful spite wintry weather, hard work, unsatisfied desires pleasure-loving youth. When Mr. March lost property trying help unfortunate friend, two oldest girls begged allowed something toward support, least. Believing could begin early cultivate energy, industry, independence, parents consented, fell work hearty good spite obstacles sure succeed last. Margaret found place nursery governess felt rich small salary. As said, ‘fond luxury’, chief trouble poverty. She found harder bear others could remember time home beautiful, life full ease pleasure, want kind unknown. She tried envious discontented, natural young girl long pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, happy life. At Kings’ daily saw wanted, children’s older sisters out, Meg caught frequent glimpses dainty ball dresses bouquets, heard lively gossip theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, merrymakings kinds, saw money lavished trifles would precious her. Poor Meg seldom complained, sense injustice made feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, yet learned know rich blessings alone make life happy. Jo happened suit Aunt March, lame needed active person wait upon her. The childless old lady offered adopt one girls troubles came, much offended offer declined. Other friends told Marches lost chance remembered rich old lady’s will, unworldly Marches said... “We cannot give girls dozen fortunes. Rich poor, keep together happy one another.” The old lady would speak time, happening meet Jo friend’s, something comical face blunt manners struck old lady’s fancy, proposed take companion. This suit Jo all, accepted place since nothing better appeared and, every one’s surprise, got remarkably well irascible relative. There occasional tempest, Jo marched home, declaring could bear longer, Aunt March always cleared quickly, sent come back urgency could refuse, heart rather liked peppery old lady. I suspect real attraction large library fine books, left dust spiders since Uncle March died. Jo remembered kind old gentleman, used let build railroads bridges big dictionaries, tell stories queer pictures Latin books, buy cards gingerbread whenever met street. The dim, dusty room, busts staring tall bookcases, cozy chairs, globes, best all, wilderness books could wander liked, made library region bliss her. The moment Aunt March took nap, busy company, Jo hurried quiet place, curling easy chair, devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, pictures like regular bookworm. But, like happiness, last long, sure reached heart story, sweetest verse song, perilous adventure traveler, shrill voice called, “Josy-phine! Josy-phine!” leave paradise wind yarn, wash poodle, read Belsham’s Essays hour together. Jo’s ambition something splendid. What was, idea yet, left time tell her, meanwhile, found greatest affliction fact could read, run, ride much liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, restless spirit always getting scrapes, life series ups downs, comic pathetic. But training received Aunt March’s needed, thought something support made happy spite perpetual “Josy-phine!” Beth bashful go school. It tried, suffered much given up, lessons home father. Even went away, mother called devote skill energy Soldiers’ Aid Societies, Beth went faithfully best could. She housewifely little creature, helped Hannah keep home neat comfortable workers, never thinking reward loved. Long, quiet days spent, lonely idle, little world peopled imaginary friends, nature busy bee. There six dolls taken dressed every morning, Beth child still loved pets well ever. Not one whole handsome one among them, outcasts till Beth took in, sisters outgrew idols, passed Amy would nothing old ugly. Beth cherished tenderly reason, set hospital infirm dolls. No pins ever stuck cotton vitals, harsh words blows ever given them, neglect ever saddened heart repulsive, fed clothed, nursed caressed affection never failed. One forlorn fragment dollanity belonged Jo and, led tempestuous life, left wreck rag bag, dreary poorhouse rescued Beth taken refuge. Having top head, tied neat little cap, arms legs gone, hid deficiencies folding blanket devoting best bed chronic invalid. If anyone known care lavished dolly, I think would touched hearts, even laughed. She brought bits bouquets, read it, took breathe fresh air, hidden coat, sang lullabies never went bed without kissing dirty face whispering tenderly, “I hope good night, poor dear.” Beth troubles well others, angel human little girl, often ‘wept little weep’ Jo said, could take music lessons fine piano. She loved music dearly, tried hard learn, practiced away patiently jingling old instrument, seem someone (not hint Aunt March) ought help her. Nobody did, however, nobody saw Beth wipe tears yellow keys, would keep tune, alone. She sang like little lark work, never tired Marmee girls, day day said hopefully herself, “I know I get music time, I good.” There many Beths world, shy quiet, sitting corners till needed, living others cheerfully one sees sacrifices till little cricket hearth stops chirping, sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence shadow behind. If anybody asked Amy greatest trial life was, would answered once, “My nose.” When baby, Jo accidently dropped coal hod, Amy insisted fall ruined nose forever. It big red, like poor ‘Petrea’s’, rather flat, pinching world could give aristocratic point. No one minded herself, best grow, Amy felt deeply want Grecian nose, drew whole sheets handsome ones console herself. “Little Raphael,” sisters called her, decided talent drawing, never happy copying flowers, designing fairies, illustrating stories queer specimens art. Her teachers complained instead sums covered slate animals, blank pages atlas used copy maps on, caricatures ludicrous description came fluttering books unlucky moments. She got lessons well could, managed escape reprimands model deportment. She great favorite mates, good-tempered possessing happy art pleasing without effort. Her little airs graces much admired, accomplishments, besides drawing, could play twelve tunes, crochet, read French without mispronouncing two-thirds words. She plaintive way saying, “When Papa rich so-and-so,” touching, long words considered ‘perfectly elegant’ girls. Amy fair way spoiled, everyone petted her, small vanities selfishnesses growing nicely. One thing, however, rather quenched vanities. She wear cousin’s clothes. Now Florence’s mama particle taste, Amy suffered deeply wear red instead blue bonnet, unbecoming gowns, fussy aprons fit. Everything good, well made, little worn, Amy’s artistic eyes much afflicted, especially winter, school dress dull purple yellow dots trimming. “My comfort,” said Meg, tears eyes, “is Mother take tucks dresses whenever I naughty, Maria Parks’s mother does. My dear, really dreadful, sometimes bad frock knees, cannot come school. When I think _deggerredation_, I feel I bear even flat nose purple gown yellow sky-rockets it.” Meg Amy’s confidant monitor, strange attraction opposites Jo gentle Beth’s. To Jo alone shy child tell thoughts, big harum-scarum sister Beth unconsciously exercised influence anyone family. The two older girls great deal one another, took one younger sisters keeping watched way, ‘playing mother’ called it, put sisters places discarded dolls maternal instinct little women. “Has anybody got anything tell? It dismal day I really dying amusement,” said Meg, sat sewing together evening. “I queer time Aunt today, and, I got best it, I tell it,” began Jo, dearly loved tell stories. “I reading everlasting Belsham, droning away I always do, Aunt soon drops off, I take nice book, read like fury till wakes up. I actually made sleepy, began nod, I gave gape asked I meant opening mouth wide enough take whole book once.” “I wish I could, done it,” said I, trying saucy. “Then gave long lecture sins, told sit think ‘lost’ moment. She never finds soon, minute cap began bob like top-heavy dahlia, I whipped _Vicar Wakefield_ pocket, read away, one eye one Aunt. I would got tumbled water I forgot laughed loud. Aunt woke and, good-natured nap, told read bit show frivolous work I preferred worthy instructive Belsham. I best, liked it, though said... “‘I understand about. Go back begin it, child.’” “Back I went, made Primroses interesting ever I could. Once I wicked enough stop thrilling place, say meekly, ‘I afraid tires you, madam. Shall I stop now?’” “She caught knitting, dropped hands, gave sharp look specs, said, short way, ‘Finish chapter, impertinent, miss’.” “Did liked it?” asked Meg. “Oh, bless you, no! But let old Belsham rest, I ran back gloves afternoon, was, hard Vicar hear laugh I danced jig hall good time coming. What pleasant life might chose! I envy much, spite money, rich people many worries poor ones, I think,” added Jo. “That reminds me,” said Meg, “that I got something tell. It funny, like Jo’s story, I thought good deal I came home. At Kings’ today I found everybody flurry, one children said oldest brother done something dreadful, Papa sent away. I heard Mrs. King crying Mr. King talking loud, Grace Ellen turned away faces passed me, I see red swollen eyes were. I ask questions, course, I felt sorry rather glad I wild brothers wicked things disgrace family.” “I think disgraced school great deal try_inger_ anything bad boys do,” said Amy, shaking head, experience life deep one. “Susie Perkins came school today lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted dreadfully, wished I might. Well, drew picture Mr. Davis, monstrous nose hump, words, ‘Young ladies, eye upon you!’ coming mouth balloon thing. We laughing sudden eye _was_ us, ordered Susie bring slate. She _parry_lized fright, went, oh, _do_ think did? He took ear—the ear! Just fancy horrid!—and led recitation platform, made stand half hour, holding slate everyone could see.” “Did girls laugh picture?” asked Jo, relished scrape. “Laugh? Not one! They sat still mice, Susie cried quarts, I know did. I envy then, I felt millions carnelian rings would made happy that. I never, never got agonizing mortification.” And Amy went work, proud consciousness virtue successful utterance two long words breath. “I saw something I liked morning, I meant tell dinner, I forgot,” said Beth, putting Jo’s topsy-turvy basket order talked. “When I went get oysters Hannah, Mr. Laurence fish shop, see me, I kept behind fish barrel, busy Mr. Cutter fish-man. A poor woman came pail mop, asked Mr. Cutter would let scrubbing bit fish, dinner children, disappointed day’s work. Mr. Cutter hurry said ‘No’, rather crossly, going away, looking hungry sorry, Mr. Laurence hooked big fish crooked end cane held her. She glad surprised took right arms, thanked over. He told ‘go along cook it’, hurried off, happy! Was good him? Oh, look funny, hugging big, slippery fish, hoping Mr. Laurence’s bed heaven would ‘aisy’.” When laughed Beth’s story, asked mother one, moments thought, said soberly, “As I sat cutting blue flannel jackets today rooms, I felt anxious Father, thought lonely helpless be, anything happened him. It wise thing do, I kept worrying till old man came order clothes. He sat near me, I began talk him, looked poor tired anxious. “‘Have sons army?’ I asked, note brought me.” “Yes, madam. I four, two killed, one prisoner, I going other, sick Washington hospital.’ answered quietly.” “‘You done great deal country, sir,’ I said, feeling respect now, instead pity.” “‘Not mite I ought, madam. I would go myself, I use. As I not, I give boys, give free.’” “He spoke cheerfully, looked sincere, seemed glad give all, I ashamed myself. I would given one man thought much, gave four without grudging them. I girls comfort home, last son waiting, miles away, say good-by him, perhaps! I felt rich, happy thinking blessings, I made nice bundle, gave money, thanked heartily lesson taught me.” “Tell another story, Mother, one moral it, like this. I like think afterward, real preachy,” said Jo, minute’s silence. Mrs. March smiled began once, told stories little audience many years, knew please them. “Once upon time, four girls, enough eat drink wear, good many comforts pleasures, kind friends parents loved dearly, yet contented.” (Here listeners stole sly looks one another, began sew diligently.) “These girls anxious good made many excellent resolutions, keep well, constantly saying, ‘If this,’ ‘If could that,’ quite forgetting much already had, many things actually could do. So asked old woman spell could use make happy, said, ‘When feel discontented, think blessings, grateful.’” (Here Jo looked quickly, speak, changed mind, seeing story done yet.) “Being sensible girls, decided try advice, soon surprised see well were. One discovered money could keep shame sorrow rich people’s houses, another that, though poor, great deal happier, youth, health, good spirits, certain fretful, feeble old lady could enjoy comforts, third that, disagreeable help get dinner, harder still go begging fourth, even carnelian rings valuable good behavior. So agreed stop complaining, enjoy blessings already possessed, try deserve them, lest taken away entirely, instead increased, I believe never disappointed sorry took old woman’s advice.” “Now, Marmee, cunning turn stories us, give us sermon instead romance!” cried Meg. “I like kind sermon. It sort Father used tell us,” said Beth thoughtfully, putting needles straight Jo’s cushion. “I complain near much others do, I shall careful ever now, I warning Susie’s downfall,” said Amy morally. “We needed lesson, forget it. If so, say us, old Chloe _Uncle Tom_, ‘Tink ob yer marcies, chillen!’ ‘Tink ob yer marcies!’” added Jo, could not, life her, help getting morsel fun little sermon, though took heart much them. CHAPTER FIVE BEING NEIGHBORLY “What world going now, Jo?” asked Meg one snowy afternoon, sister came tramping hall, rubber boots, old sack, hood, broom one hand shovel other. “Going exercise,” answered Jo mischievous twinkle eyes. “I think two long walks morning would enough! It cold dull out, I advise stay warm dry fire, I do,” said Meg shiver. “Never take advice! Cannot keep still day, pussycat, I like doze fire. I like adventures, I going find some.” Meg went back toast feet read _Ivanhoe_, Jo began dig paths great energy. The snow light, broom soon swept path round garden, Beth walk sun came invalid dolls needed air. Now, garden separated Marches’ house Mr. Laurence. Both stood suburb city, still country-like, groves lawns, large gardens, quiet streets. A low hedge parted two estates. On one side old, brown house, looking rather bare shabby, robbed vines summer covered walls flowers, surrounded it. On side stately stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort comfort luxury, big coach house well-kept grounds conservatory glimpses lovely things one caught rich curtains. Yet seemed lonely, lifeless sort house, children frolicked lawn, motherly face ever smiled windows, people went out, except old gentleman grandson. To Jo’s lively fancy, fine house seemed kind enchanted palace, full splendors delights one enjoyed. She long wanted behold hidden glories, know Laurence boy, looked would like known, knew begin. Since party, eager ever, planned many ways making friends him, seen lately, Jo began think gone away, one day spied brown face upper window, looking wistfully garden, Beth Amy snow-balling one another. “That boy suffering society fun,” said herself. “His grandpa know good him, keeps shut alone. He needs party jolly boys play with, somebody young lively. I great mind go tell old gentleman so!” The idea amused Jo, liked daring things always scandalizing Meg queer performances. The plan ‘going over’ forgotten. And snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved try could done. She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, sallied dig way hedge, paused took survey. All quiet, curtains lower windows, servants sight, nothing human visible curly black head leaning thin hand upper window. “There is,” thought Jo, “Poor boy! All alone sick dismal day. It shame! I toss snowball make look out, say kind word him.” Up went handful soft snow, head turned once, showing face lost listless look minute, big eyes brightened mouth began smile. Jo nodded laughed, flourished broom called out... “How do? Are sick?” Laurie opened window, croaked hoarsely raven... “Better, thank you. I bad cold, shut week.” “I sorry. What amuse with?” “Nothing. It dull tombs here.” “Do read?” “Not much. They let me.” “Cannot somebody read you?” “Grandpa sometimes, books interest him, I hate ask Brooke time.” “Have someone come see then.” “There anyone I would like see. Boys make row, head weak.” “Is nice girl would read amuse you? Girls quiet like play nurse.” “Do know any.” “You know us,” began Jo, laughed stopped. “So I do! Will come, please?” cried Laurie. “I quiet nice, I come, Mother let me. I go ask her. Shut window, like good boy, wait till I come.” With that, Jo shouldered broom marched house, wondering would say her. Laurie flutter excitement idea company, flew get ready, Mrs. March said, ‘a little gentleman’, honor coming guest brushing curly pate, putting fresh color, trying tidy room, spite half dozen servants, anything neat. Presently came loud ring, decided voice, asking ‘Mr. Laurie’, surprised-looking servant came running announce young lady. “All right, show up, Miss Jo,” said Laurie, going door little parlor meet Jo, appeared, looking rosy quite ease, covered dish one hand Beth’s three kittens other. “Here I am, bag baggage,” said briskly. “Mother sent love, glad I could anything you. Meg wanted bring blanc mange, makes nicely, Beth thought cats would comforting. I knew would laugh them, I could refuse, anxious something.” It happened Beth’s funny loan thing, laughing kits, Laurie forgot bashfulness, grew sociable once. “That looks pretty eat,” said, smiling pleasure, Jo uncovered dish, showed blanc mange, surrounded garland green leaves, scarlet flowers Amy’s pet geranium. “It anything, felt kindly wanted show it. Tell girl put away tea. It simple eat it, soft, slip without hurting sore throat. What cozy room is!” “It might kept nice, maids lazy, I know make mind. It worries though.” “I right two minutes, needs hearth brushed, so—and things made straight mantelpiece, so—and books put here, bottles there, sofa turned light, pillows plumped bit. Now then, fixed.” And was, for, laughed talked, Jo whisked things place given quite different air room. Laurie watched respectful silence, beckoned sofa, sat sigh satisfaction, saying gratefully... “How kind are! Yes, wanted. Now please take big chair let something amuse company.” “No, I came amuse you. Shall I read aloud?” Jo looked affectionately toward inviting books near by. “Thank you! I read those, mind, I would rather talk,” answered Laurie. “Not bit. I talk day set going. Beth says I never know stop.” “Is Beth rosy one, stays home good deal sometimes goes little basket?” asked Laurie interest. “Yes, Beth. She girl, regular good one is, too.” “The pretty one Meg, curly-haired one Amy, I believe?” “How find out?” Laurie colored up, answered frankly, “Why, see I often hear calling one another, I alone here, I cannot help looking house, always seem good times. I beg pardon rude, sometimes forget put curtain window flowers are. And lamps lighted, like looking picture see fire, around table mother. Her face right opposite, looks sweet behind flowers, I cannot help watching it. I got mother, know.” And Laurie poked fire hide little twitching lips could control. The solitary, hungry look eyes went straight Jo’s warm heart. She simply taught nonsense head, fifteen innocent frank child. Laurie sick lonely, feeling rich home happiness, gladly tried share him. Her face friendly sharp voice unusually gentle said... “We never draw curtain more, I give leave look much like. I wish, though, instead peeping, would come see us. Mother splendid, would heaps good, Beth would sing I begged to, Amy would dance. Meg I would make laugh funny stage properties, would jolly times. Would grandpa let you?” “I think would, mother asked him. He kind, though look so, let us I like, pretty much, afraid I might bother strangers,” began Laurie, brightening more. “We strangers, neighbors, need think would bother. We want know you, I trying ever long. We great while, know, got acquainted neighbors you.” “You see, Grandpa lives among books, mind much happens outside. Mr. Brooke, tutor, stay here, know, I one go me, I stop home get I can.” “That bad. You ought make effort go visiting everywhere asked, plenty friends, pleasant places go to. Never mind bashful. It last long keep going.” Laurie turned red again, offended accused bashfulness, much good Jo impossible take blunt speeches kindly meant. “Do like school?” asked boy, changing subject, little pause, stared fire Jo looked her, well pleased. “Do go school, I businessman—girl, I mean. I go wait great-aunt, dear, cross old soul is, too,” answered Jo. Laurie opened mouth ask another question, remembering time manners make many inquiries people’s affairs, shut again, looked uncomfortable. Jo liked good breeding, mind laugh Aunt March, gave lively description fidgety old lady, fat poodle, parrot talked Spanish, library reveled. Laurie enjoyed immensely, told prim old gentleman came woo Aunt March, middle fine speech, Poll tweaked wig great dismay, boy lay back laughed till tears ran cheeks, maid popped head see matter. “Oh! That end good. Tell on, please,” said, taking face sofa cushion, red shining merriment. Much elated success, Jo ‘tell on’, plays plans, hopes fears Father, interesting events little world sisters lived. Then got talking books, Jo’s delight, found Laurie loved well did, read even herself. “If like much, come see ours. Grandfather out, need afraid,” said Laurie, getting up. “I afraid anything,” returned Jo, toss head. “I believe are!” exclaimed boy, looking much admiration, though privately thought would good reason trifle afraid old gentleman, met moods. The atmosphere whole house summerlike, Laurie led way room room, letting Jo stop examine whatever struck fancy. And so, last came library, clapped hands pranced, always especially delighted. It lined books, pictures statues, distracting little cabinets full coins curiosities, Sleepy Hollow chairs, queer tables, bronzes, best all, great open fireplace quaint tiles round it. “What richness!” sighed Jo, sinking depth velour chair gazing air intense satisfaction. “Theodore Laurence, ought happiest boy world,” added impressively. “A fellow cannot live books,” said Laurie, shaking head perched table opposite. Before could say more, bell rang, Jo flew up, exclaiming alarm, “Mercy me! It grandpa!” “Well, is? You afraid anything, know,” returned boy, looking wicked. “I think I little bit afraid him, I know I be. Marmee said I might come, I think worse it,” said Jo, composing herself, though kept eyes door. “I great deal better it, ever much obliged. I afraid tired talking me. It pleasant, I could bear stop,” said Laurie gratefully. “The doctor see you, sir,” maid beckoned spoke. “Would mind I left minute? I suppose I must see him,” said Laurie. “Do mind me. I happy cricket here,” answered Jo. Laurie went away, guest amused way. She standing fine portrait old gentleman door opened again, without turning, said decidedly, “I sure I afraid him, got kind eyes, though mouth grim, looks tremendous own. He handsome grandfather, I like him.” “Thank you, madam,” said gruff voice behind her, there, great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence. Poor Jo blushed till could blush redder, heart began beat uncomfortably fast thought said. For minute wild desire run away possessed her, cowardly, girls would laugh her, resolved stay get scrape could. A second look showed living eyes, bushy eyebrows, kinder even painted ones, sly twinkle them, lessened fear good deal. The gruff voice gruffer ever, old gentleman said abruptly, dreadful pause, “So afraid me, hey?” “Not much, sir.” “And think handsome grandfather?” “Not quite, sir.” “And I got tremendous will, I?” “I said I thought so.” “But like spite it?” “Yes, I do, sir.” That answer pleased old gentleman. He gave short laugh, shook hands her, and, putting finger chin, turned face, examined gravely, let go, saying nod, “You got grandfather’s spirit, face. He fine man, dear, better, brave honest one, I proud friend.” “Thank you, sir,” And Jo quite comfortable that, suited exactly. “What boy mine, hey?” next question, sharply put. “Only trying neighborly, sir.” And Jo told visit came about. “You think needs cheering bit, you?” “Yes, sir, seems little lonely, young folks would good perhaps. We girls, glad help could, forget splendid Christmas present sent us,” said Jo eagerly. “Tut, tut, tut! That boy’s affair. How poor woman?” “Doing nicely, sir.” And went Jo, talking fast, told Hummels, mother interested richer friends were. “Just father’s way good. I shall come see mother fine day. Tell so. There tea bell, early boy’s account. Come go neighborly.” “If would like me, sir.” “Should ask you, I not.” And Mr. Laurence offered arm old-fashioned courtesy. “What would Meg say this?” thought Jo, marched away, eyes danced fun imagined telling story home. “Hey! Why, dickens come fellow?” said old gentleman, Laurie came running downstairs brought start surprise astounding sight Jo arm arm redoubtable grandfather. “I know would come, sir,” began, Jo gave triumphant little glance. “That evident, way racket downstairs. Come tea, sir, behave like gentleman.” And pulled boy’s hair way caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, Laurie went series comic evolutions behind backs, nearly produced explosion laughter Jo. The old gentleman say much drank four cups tea, watched young people, soon chatted away like old friends, change grandson escape him. There color, light, life boy’s face now, vivacity manner, genuine merriment laugh. “She right, lad lonely. I see little girls him,” thought Mr. Laurence, looked listened. He liked Jo, odd, blunt ways suited him, seemed understand boy almost well one herself. If Laurences Jo called ‘prim poky’, would got all, people always made shy awkward. But finding free easy, herself, made good impression. When rose proposed go, Laurie said something show her, took away conservatory, lighted benefit. It seemed quite fairylike Jo, went walks, enjoying blooming walls either side, soft light, damp sweet air, wonderful vines trees hung her, new friend cut finest flowers till hands full. Then tied up, saying, happy look Jo liked see, “Please give mother, tell I like medicine sent much.” They found Mr. Laurence standing fire great drawing room, Jo’s attention entirely absorbed grand piano, stood open. “Do play?” asked, turning Laurie respectful expression. “Sometimes,” answered modestly. “Please now. I want hear it, I tell Beth.” “Will first?” “Do know how. Too stupid learn, I love music dearly.” So Laurie played Jo listened, nose luxuriously buried heliotrope tea roses. Her respect regard ‘Laurence’ boy increased much, played remarkably well put airs. She wished Beth could hear him, say so, praised till quite abashed, grandfather came rescue. “That do, do, young lady. Too many sugarplums good him. His music bad, I hope well important things. Going? well, I much obliged you, I hope come again. My respects mother. Good night, Doctor Jo.” He shook hands kindly, looked something please him. When got hall, Jo asked Laurie said something amiss. He shook head. “No, me. He like hear play.” “Why not?” “I tell day. John going home you, I cannot.” “No need that. I young lady, step. Take care yourself, you?” “Yes, come again, I hope?” “If promise come see us well.” “I will.” “Good night, Laurie!” “Good night, Jo, good night!” When afternoon’s adventures told, family felt inclined go visiting body, found something attractive big house side hedge. Mrs. March wanted talk father old man forgotten him, Meg longed walk conservatory, Beth sighed grand piano, Amy eager see fine pictures statues. “Mother, Mr. Laurence like Laurie play?” asked Jo, inquiring disposition. “I sure, I think son, Laurie’s father, married Italian lady, musician, displeased old man, proud. The lady good lovely accomplished, like her, never saw son married. They died Laurie little child, grandfather took home. I fancy boy, born Italy, strong, old man afraid losing him, makes careful. Laurie comes naturally love music, like mother, I dare say grandfather fears may want musician. At rate, skill reminds woman like, ‘glowered’ Jo said.” “Dear me, romantic!” exclaimed Meg. “How silly!” said Jo. “Let musician wants to, plague life sending college, hates go.” “That handsome black eyes pretty manners, I suppose. Italians always nice,” said Meg, little sentimental. “What know eyes manners? You never spoke him, hardly,” cried Jo, sentimental. “I saw party, tell shows knows behave. That nice little speech medicine Mother sent him.” “He meant blanc mange, I suppose.” “How stupid are, child! He meant you, course.” “Did he?” And Jo opened eyes never occurred before. “I never saw girl! You know compliment get it,” said Meg, air young lady knew matter. “I think great nonsense, I thank silly spoil fun. Laurie’s nice boy I like him, I sentimental stuff compliments rubbish. We good got mother, may come see us, may he, Marmee?” “Yes, Jo, little friend welcome, I hope Meg remember children children long can.” “I call child, I teens yet,” observed Amy. “What say, Beth?” “I thinking ‘_Pilgrim’s Progress_’,” answered Beth, heard word. “How got Slough Wicket Gate resolving good, steep hill trying, maybe house there, full splendid things, going Palace Beautiful.” “We got get lions first,” said Jo, rather liked prospect. CHAPTER SIX BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL The big house prove Palace Beautiful, though took time get in, Beth found hard pass lions. Old Mr. Laurence biggest one, called, said something funny kind one girls, talked old times mother, nobody felt much afraid him, except timid Beth. The lion fact poor Laurie rich, made shy accepting favors could return. But, while, found considered benefactors, could enough show grateful Mrs. March’s motherly welcome, cheerful society, comfort took humble home theirs. So soon forgot pride interchanged kindnesses without stopping think greater. All sorts pleasant things happened time, new friendship flourished like grass spring. Every one liked Laurie, privately informed tutor “the Marches regularly splendid girls.” With delightful enthusiasm youth, took solitary boy midst made much him, found something charming innocent companionship simple-hearted girls. Never known mother sisters, quick feel influences brought him, busy, lively ways made ashamed indolent life led. He tired books, found people interesting Mr. Brooke obliged make unsatisfactory reports, Laurie always playing truant running Marches’. “Never mind, let take holiday, make afterward,” said old gentleman. “The good lady next door says studying hard needs young society, amusement, exercise. I suspect right, I coddling fellow I would grandmother. Let likes, long happy. He cannot get mischief little nunnery there, Mrs. March can.” What good times had, sure. Such plays tableaux, sleigh rides skating frolics, pleasant evenings old parlor, gay little parties great house. Meg could walk conservatory whenever liked revel bouquets, Jo browsed new library voraciously, convulsed old gentleman criticisms, Amy copied pictures enjoyed beauty heart’s content, Laurie played ‘lord manor’ delightful style. But Beth, though yearning grand piano, could pluck courage go ‘Mansion Bliss’, Meg called it. She went Jo, old gentleman, aware infirmity, stared hard heavy eyebrows, said “Hey!” loud, frightened much ‘feet chattered floor’, never told mother, ran away, declaring would never go more, even dear piano. No persuasions enticements could overcome fear, till, fact coming Mr. Laurence’s ear mysterious way, set mending matters. During one brief calls made, artfully led conversation music, talked away great singers seen, fine organs heard, told charming anecdotes Beth found impossible stay distant corner, crept nearer nearer, fascinated. At back chair stopped stood listening, great eyes wide open cheeks red excitement unusual performance. Taking notice fly, Mr. Laurence talked Laurie’s lessons teachers. And presently, idea occurred him, said Mrs. March... “The boy neglects music now, I glad it, getting fond it. But piano suffers want use. Would girls like run over, practice then, keep tune, know, madam?” Beth took step forward, pressed hands tightly together keep clapping them, irresistible temptation, thought practicing splendid instrument quite took breath away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went odd little nod smile... “They need see speak anyone, run time. For I shut study end house, Laurie great deal, servants never near drawing room nine clock.” Here rose, going, Beth made mind speak, last arrangement left nothing desired. “Please, tell young ladies I say, care come, why, never mind.” Here little hand slipped his, Beth looked face full gratitude, said, earnest yet timid way... “Oh sir, care, much!” “Are musical girl?” asked, without startling “Hey!” looked kindly. “I Beth. I love dearly, I come, quite sure nobody hear me, disturbed,” added, fearing rude, trembling boldness spoke. “Not soul, dear. The house empty half day, come drum away much like, I shall obliged you.” “How kind are, sir!” Beth blushed like rose friendly look wore, frightened now, gave hand grateful squeeze words thank precious gift given her. The old gentleman softly stroked hair forehead, and, stooping down, kissed her, saying, tone people ever heard... “I little girl once, eyes like these. God bless you, dear! Good day, madam.” And away went, great hurry. Beth rapture mother, rushed impart glorious news family invalids, girls home. How blithely sang evening, laughed woke Amy night playing piano face sleep. Next day, seen old young gentleman house, Beth, two three retreats, fairly got side door, made way noiselessly mouse drawing room idol stood. Quite accident, course, pretty, easy music lay piano, trembling fingers frequent stops listen look about, Beth last touched great instrument, straightway forgot fear, herself, everything else unspeakable delight music gave her, like voice beloved friend. She stayed till Hannah came take home dinner, appetite, could sit smile upon everyone general state beatitude. After that, little brown hood slipped hedge nearly every day, great drawing room haunted tuneful spirit came went unseen. She never knew Mr. Laurence opened study door hear old-fashioned airs liked. She never saw Laurie mount guard hall warn servants away. She never suspected exercise books new songs found rack put especial benefit, talked music home, thought kind tell things helped much. So enjoyed heartily, found, always case, granted wish hoped. Perhaps grateful blessing greater given her. At rate deserved both. “Mother, I going work Mr. Laurence pair slippers. He kind me, I must thank him, I know way. Can I it?” asked Beth, weeks eventful call his. “Yes, dear. It please much, nice way thanking him. The girls help them, I pay making up,” replied Mrs. March, took peculiar pleasure granting Beth’s requests seldom asked anything herself. After many serious discussions Meg Jo, pattern chosen, materials bought, slippers begun. A cluster grave yet cheerful pansies deeper purple ground pronounced appropriate pretty, Beth worked away early late, occasional lifts hard parts. She nimble little needlewoman, finished anyone got tired them. Then wrote short, simple note, Laurie’s help, got smuggled onto study table one morning old gentleman up. When excitement over, Beth waited see would happen. All day passed part next acknowledgement arrived, beginning fear offended crochety friend. On afternoon second day, went errand, give poor Joanna, invalid doll, daily exercise. As came street, return, saw three, yes, four heads popping parlor windows, moment saw her, several hands waved, several joyful voices screamed... “Here letter old gentleman! Come quick, read it!” “Oh, Beth, sent you...” began Amy, gesticulating unseemly energy, got further, Jo quenched slamming window. Beth hurried flutter suspense. At door sisters seized bore parlor triumphal procession, pointing saying once, “Look there! Look there!” Beth look, turned pale delight surprise, stood little cabinet piano, letter lying glossy lid, directed like sign board “Miss Elizabeth March.” “For me?” gasped Beth, holding onto Jo feeling tumble down, overwhelming thing altogether. “Yes, you, precious! Is splendid him? Do think dearest old man world? Here key letter. We open it, dying know says,” cried Jo, hugging sister offering note. “You read it! I cannot, I feel queer! Oh, lovely!” Beth hid face Jo’s apron, quite upset present. Jo opened paper began laugh, first words saw were... “Miss March: “Dear Madam—” “How nice sounds! I wish someone would write so!” said Amy, thought old-fashioned address elegant. “‘I many pairs slippers life, I never suited well yours,’” continues Jo. “‘Heart’s-ease favorite flower, always remind gentle giver. I like pay debts, I know allow ‘the old gentleman’ send something belonged little grand daughter lost. With hearty thanks best wishes, I remain “‘Your grateful friend humble servant, ‘JAMES LAURENCE’.” “There, Beth, honor proud of, I sure! Laurie told fond Mr. Laurence used child died, kept little things carefully. Just think, given piano. That comes big blue eyes loving music,” said Jo, trying soothe Beth, trembled looked excited ever before. “See cunning brackets hold candles, nice green silk, puckered up, gold rose middle, pretty rack stool, complete,” added Meg, opening instrument displaying beauties. “‘Your humble servant, James Laurence’. Only think writing you. I tell girls. They think splendid,” said Amy, much impressed note. “Try it, honey. Let us hear sound baby pianny,” said Hannah, always took share family joys sorrows. So Beth tried it, everyone pronounced remarkable piano ever heard. It evidently newly tuned put apple-pie order, but, perfect was, I think real charm lay happiest happy faces leaned it, Beth lovingly touched beautiful black white keys pressed bright pedals. “You go thank him,” said Jo, way joke, idea child’s really going never entered head. “Yes, I mean to. I guess I go now, I get frightened thinking it.” And, utter amazement assembled family, Beth walked deliberately garden, hedge, Laurences’ door. “Well, I wish I may die queerest thing I ever see! The pianny turned head! She would never gone right mind,” cried Hannah, staring her, girls rendered quite speechless miracle. They would still amazed seen Beth afterward. If believe me, went knocked study door gave time think, gruff voice called out, “come in!” go in, right Mr. Laurence, looked quite taken aback, held hand, saying, small quaver voice, “I came thank you, sir, for...” But finish, looked friendly forgot speech and, remembering lost little girl loved, put arms round neck kissed him. If roof house suddenly flown off, old gentleman would astonished. But liked it. Oh, dear, yes, liked amazingly! And touched pleased confiding little kiss crustiness vanished, set knee, laid wrinkled cheek rosy one, feeling got little granddaughter back again. Beth ceased fear moment, sat talking cozily known life, love casts fear, gratitude conquer pride. When went home, walked gate, shook hands cordially, touched hat marched back again, looking stately erect, like handsome, soldierly old gentleman, was. When girls saw performance, Jo began dance jig, way expressing satisfaction, Amy nearly fell window surprise, Meg exclaimed, up-lifted hands, “Well, I believe world coming end.” CHAPTER SEVEN AMY’S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION “That boy perfect cyclops, he?” said Amy one day, Laurie clattered horseback, flourish whip passed. “How dare say so, got eyes? And handsome ones are, too,” cried Jo, resented slighting remarks friend. “I say anything eyes, I see need fire I admire riding.” “Oh, goodness! That little goose means centaur, called Cyclops,” exclaimed Jo, burst laughter. “You need rude, ‘lapse lingy’, Mr. Davis says,” retorted Amy, finishing Jo Latin. “I wish I little money Laurie spends horse,” added, herself, yet hoping sisters would hear. “Why?” asked Meg kindly, Jo gone another laugh Amy’s second blunder. “I need much. I dreadfully debt, turn rag money month.” “In debt, Amy? What mean?” And Meg looked sober. “Why, I owe least dozen pickled limes, I cannot pay them, know, till I money, Marmee forbade anything charged shop.” “Tell it. Are limes fashion now? It used pricking bits rubber make balls.” And Meg tried keep countenance, Amy looked grave important. “Why, see, girls always buying them, unless want thought mean, must too. It nothing limes now, everyone sucking desks schooltime, trading pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, something else, recess. If one girl likes another, gives lime. If mad her, eats one face, offer even suck. They treat turns, I ever many returned them, I ought debts honor, know.” “How much pay restore credit?” asked Meg, taking purse. “A quarter would it, leave cents treat you. Do like limes?” “Not much. You may share. Here money. Make last long can, plenty, know.” “Oh, thank you! It must nice pocket money! I grand feast, I tasted lime week. I felt delicate taking any, I could return them, I actually suffering one.” Next day Amy rather late school, could resist temptation displaying, pardonable pride, moist brown-paper parcel, consigned inmost recesses desk. During next minutes rumor Amy March got twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one way) going treat circulated ‘set’, attentions friends became quite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited next party spot. Mary Kingsley insisted lending watch till recess, Jenny Snow, satirical young lady, basely twitted Amy upon limeless state, promptly buried hatchet offered furnish answers certain appalling sums. But Amy forgotten Miss Snow’s cutting remarks ‘some persons whose noses flat smell people’s limes, stuck-up people proud ask them’, instantly crushed ‘that Snow girl’s’ hopes withering telegram, “You need polite sudden, get any.” A distinguished personage happened visit school morning, Amy’s beautifully drawn maps received praise, honor foe rankled soul Miss Snow, caused Miss March assume airs studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! Pride goes fall, revengeful Snow turned tables disastrous success. No sooner guest paid usual stale compliments bowed out, Jenny, pretense asking important question, informed Mr. Davis, teacher, Amy March pickled limes desk. Now Mr. Davis declared limes contraband article, solemnly vowed publicly ferrule first person found breaking law. This much-enduring man succeeded banishing chewing gum long stormy war, made bonfire confiscated novels newspapers, suppressed private post office, forbidden distortions face, nicknames, caricatures, done one man could keep half hundred rebellious girls order. Boys trying enough human patience, goodness knows, girls infinitely so, especially nervous gentlemen tyrannical tempers talent teaching Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis knew quantity Greek, Latin, algebra, ologies sorts called fine teacher, manners, morals, feelings, examples considered particular importance. It unfortunate moment denouncing Amy, Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis evidently taken coffee strong morning, east wind, always affected neuralgia, pupils done credit felt deserved. Therefore, use expressive, elegant, language schoolgirl, “He nervous witch cross bear”. The word ‘limes’ like fire powder, yellow face flushed, rapped desk energy made Jenny skip seat unusual rapidity. “Young ladies, attention, please!” At stern order buzz ceased, fifty pairs blue, black, gray, brown eyes obediently fixed upon awful countenance. “Miss March, come desk.” Amy rose comply outward composure, secret fear oppressed her, limes weighed upon conscience. “Bring limes desk,” unexpected command arrested got seat. “Do take all.” whispered neighbor, young lady great presence mind. Amy hastily shook half dozen laid rest Mr. Davis, feeling man possessing human heart would relent delicious perfume met nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis particularly detested odor fashionable pickle, disgust added wrath. “Is all?” “Not quite,” stammered Amy. “Bring rest immediately.” With despairing glance set, obeyed. “You sure more?” “I never lie, sir.” “So I see. Now take disgusting things two two, throw window.” There simultaneous sigh, created quite little gust, last hope fled, treat ravished longing lips. Scarlet shame anger, Amy went fro six dreadful times, doomed couple, looking oh, plump juicy, fell reluctant hands, shout street completed anguish girls, told feast exulted little Irish children, sworn foes. This—this much. All flashed indignant appealing glances inexorable Davis, one passionate lime lover burst tears. As Amy returned last trip, Mr. Davis gave portentous “Hem!” said, impressive manner... “Young ladies, remember I said week ago. I sorry happened, I never allow rules infringed, I never break word. Miss March, hold hand.” Amy started, put hands behind her, turning imploring look pleaded better words could utter. She rather favorite ‘old Davis’, as, course, called, private belief would broken word indignation one irrepressible young lady found vent hiss. That hiss, faint was, irritated irascible gentleman, sealed culprit’s fate. “Your hand, Miss March!” answer mute appeal received, proud cry beseech, Amy set teeth, threw back head defiantly, bore without flinching several tingling blows little palm. They neither many heavy, made difference her. For first time life struck, disgrace, eyes, deep knocked down. “You stand platform till recess,” said Mr. Davis, resolved thing thoroughly, since begun. That dreadful. It would bad enough go seat, see pitying faces friends, satisfied ones enemies, face whole school, shame fresh upon her, seemed impossible, second felt could drop stood, break heart crying. A bitter sense wrong thought Jenny Snow helped bear it, and, taking ignominious place, fixed eyes stove funnel seemed sea faces, stood there, motionless white girls found hard study pathetic figure them. During fifteen minutes followed, proud sensitive little girl suffered shame pain never forgot. To others might seem ludicrous trivial affair, hard experience, twelve years life governed love alone, blow sort never touched before. The smart hand ache heart forgotten sting thought, “I shall tell home, disappointed me!” The fifteen minutes seemed hour, came end last, word ‘Recess!’ never seemed welcome before. “You go, Miss March,” said Mr. Davis, looking, felt, uncomfortable. He soon forget reproachful glance Amy gave him, went, without word anyone, straight anteroom, snatched things, left place “forever,” passionately declared herself. She sad state got home, older girls arrived, time later, indignation meeting held once. Mrs. March say much looked disturbed, comforted afflicted little daughter tenderest manner. Meg bathed insulted hand glycerine tears, Beth felt even beloved kittens would fail balm griefs like this, Jo wrathfully proposed Mr. Davis arrested without delay, Hannah shook fist ‘villain’ pounded potatoes dinner pestle. No notice taken Amy’s flight, except mates, sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered Mr. Davis quite benignant afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just school closed, Jo appeared, wearing grim expression stalked desk, delivered letter mother, collected Amy’s property, departed, carefully scraping mud boots door mat, shook dust place feet. “Yes, vacation school, I want study little every day Beth,” said Mrs. March evening. “I approve corporal punishment, especially girls. I dislike Mr. Davis’s manner teaching think girls associate good, I shall ask father’s advice I send anywhere else.” “That good! I wish girls would leave, spoil old school. It perfectly maddening think lovely limes,” sighed Amy, air martyr. “I sorry lost them, broke rules, deserved punishment disobedience,” severe reply, rather disappointed young lady, expected nothing sympathy. “Do mean glad I disgraced whole school?” cried Amy. “I chosen way mending fault,” replied mother, “but I sure good bolder method. You getting rather conceited, dear, quite time set correcting it. You good many little gifts virtues, need parading them, conceit spoils finest genius. There much danger real talent goodness overlooked long, even is, consciousness possessing using well satisfy one, great charm power modesty.” “So is!” cried Laurie, playing chess corner Jo. “I knew girl once, really remarkable talent music, know it, never guessed sweet little things composed alone, would believed anyone told her.” “I wish I would known nice girl. Maybe would helped me, I stupid,” said Beth, stood beside him, listening eagerly. “You know her, helps better anyone else could,” answered Laurie, looking mischievous meaning merry black eyes Beth suddenly turned red, hid face sofa cushion, quite overcome unexpected discovery. Jo let Laurie win game pay praise Beth, could prevailed upon play compliment. So Laurie best, sang delightfully, particularly lively humor, Marches seldom showed moody side character. When gone, Amy, pensive evening, said suddenly, busy new idea, “Is Laurie accomplished boy?” “Yes, excellent education, much talent. He make fine man, spoiled petting,” replied mother. “And conceited, he?” asked Amy. “Not least. That charming like much.” “I see. It nice accomplishments elegant, show get perked up,” said Amy thoughtfully. “These things always seen felt person’s manner conversations, modestly used, necessary display them,” said Mrs. March. “Any proper wear bonnets gowns ribbons once, folks may know got them,” added Jo, lecture ended laugh. CHAPTER EIGHT JO MEETS APOLLYON “Girls, going?” asked Amy, coming room one Saturday afternoon, finding getting ready go air secrecy excited curiosity. “Never mind. Little girls ask questions,” returned Jo sharply. Now anything mortifying feelings young, told that, bidden “run away, dear” still trying us. Amy bridled insult, determined find secret, teased hour. Turning Meg, never refused anything long, said coaxingly, “Do tell me! I think might let go, too, Beth fussing piano, I got anything do, lonely.” “I cannot, dear, invited,” began Meg, Jo broke impatiently, “Now, Meg, quiet spoil all. You cannot go, Amy, baby whine it.” “You going somewhere Laurie, I know are. You whispering laughing together sofa last night, stopped I came in. Are going him?” “Yes, are. Now still, stop bothering.” Amy held tongue, used eyes, saw Meg slip fan pocket. “I know! I know! You going theater see _Seven Castles!_” cried, adding resolutely, “and I shall go, Mother said I might see it, I got rag money, mean tell time.” “Just listen minute, good child,” said Meg soothingly. “Mother wish go week, eyes well enough yet bear light fairy piece. Next week go Beth Hannah, nice time.” “I like half well going Laurie. Please let me. I sick cold long, shut up, I dying fun. Do, Meg! I ever good,” pleaded Amy, looking pathetic could. “Suppose take her. I believe Mother would mind, bundle well,” began Meg. “If goes I shall not, I not, Laurie like it, rude, invited us, go drag Amy. I think would hate poke wanted,” said Jo crossly, disliked trouble overseeing fidgety child wanted enjoy herself. Her tone manner angered Amy, began put boots on, saying, aggravating way, “I shall go. Meg says I may, I pay myself, Laurie anything it.” “You cannot sit us, seats reserved, must sit alone, Laurie give place, spoil pleasure. Or get another seat you, proper asked. You shall stir step, may stay are,” scolded Jo, crosser ever, pricked finger hurry. Sitting floor one boot on, Amy began cry Meg reason her, Laurie called below, two girls hurried down, leaving sister wailing. For forgot grown-up ways acted like spoiled child. Just party setting out, Amy called banisters threatening tone, “You sorry this, Jo March, see not.” “Fiddlesticks!” returned Jo, slamming door. They charming time, _The Seven Castles Of The Diamond Lake_ brilliant wonderful heart could wish. But spite comical red imps, sparkling elves, gorgeous princes princesses, Jo’s pleasure drop bitterness it. The fairy queen’s yellow curls reminded Amy, acts amused wondering sister would make ‘sorry it’. She Amy many lively skirmishes course lives, quick tempers apt violent fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, Jo irritated Amy, semioccasional explosions occurred, much ashamed afterward. Although oldest, Jo least self-control, hard times trying curb fiery spirit continually getting trouble. Her anger never lasted long, humbly confessed fault, sincerely repented tried better. Her sisters used say rather liked get Jo fury angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately good, bosom enemy always ready flame defeat her, took years patient effort subdue it. When got home, found Amy reading parlor. She assumed injured air came in, never lifted eyes book, asked single question. Perhaps curiosity might conquered resentment, Beth inquire receive glowing description play. On going put away best hat, Jo’s first look toward bureau, last quarrel Amy soothed feelings turning Jo’s top drawer upside floor. Everything place, however, hasty glance various closets, bags, boxes, Jo decided Amy forgiven forgotten wrongs. There Jo mistaken, next day made discovery produced tempest. Meg, Beth, Amy sitting together, late afternoon, Jo burst room, looking excited demanding breathlessly, “Has anyone taken book?” Meg Beth said, “No.” once, looked surprised. Amy poked fire said nothing. Jo saw color rise upon minute. “Amy, got it!” “No, I not.” “You know is, then!” “No, I not.” “That fib!” cried Jo, taking shoulders, looking fierce enough frighten much braver child Amy. “It not. I got it, know now, care.” “You know something it, would better tell once, I make you.” And Jo gave slight shake. “Scold much like, never see silly old book again,” cried Amy, getting excited turn. “Why not?” “I burned up.” “What! My little book I fond of, worked over, meant finish Father got home? Have really burned it?” said Jo, turning pale, eyes kindled hands clutched Amy nervously. “Yes, I did! I told I would make pay cross yesterday, I have, so...” Amy got farther, Jo’s hot temper mastered her, shook Amy till teeth chattered head, crying passion grief anger... “You wicked, wicked girl! I never write again, I never forgive long I live.” Meg flew rescue Amy, Beth pacify Jo, Jo quite beside herself, parting box sister’s ear, rushed room old sofa garret, finished fight alone. The storm cleared below, Mrs. March came home, and, heard story, soon brought Amy sense wrong done sister. Jo’s book pride heart, regarded family literary sprout great promise. It half dozen little fairy tales, Jo worked patiently, putting whole heart work, hoping make something good enough print. She copied great care, destroyed old manuscript, Amy’s bonfire consumed loving work several years. It seemed small loss others, Jo dreadful calamity, felt never could made her. Beth mourned departed kitten, Meg refused defend pet. Mrs. March looked grave grieved, Amy felt one would love till asked pardon act regretted them. When tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking grim unapproachable took Amy’s courage say meekly... “Please forgive me, Jo. I very, sorry.” “I never shall forgive you,” Jo’s stern answer, moment ignored Amy entirely. No one spoke great trouble, even Mrs. March, learned experience Jo mood words wasted, wisest course wait till little accident, generous nature, softened Jo’s resentment healed breach. It happy evening, though sewed usual, mother read aloud Bremer, Scott, Edgeworth, something wanting, sweet home peace disturbed. They felt singing time came, Beth could play, Jo stood dumb stone, Amy broke down, Meg Mother sang alone. But spite efforts cheery larks, flutelike voices seem chord well usual, felt tune. As Jo received good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, “My dear, let sun go upon anger. Forgive other, help other, begin tomorrow.” Jo wanted lay head motherly bosom, cry grief anger away, tears unmanly weakness, felt deeply injured really could quite forgive yet. So winked hard, shook head, said gruffly Amy listening, “It abominable thing, deserve forgiven.” With marched bed, merry confidential gossip night. Amy much offended overtures peace repulsed, began wish humbled herself, feel injured ever, plume superior virtue way particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like thunder cloud, nothing went well day. It bitter cold morning, dropped precious turnover gutter, Aunt March attack fidgets, Meg sensitive, Beth would look grieved wistful got home, Amy kept making remarks people always talking good yet would even try people set virtuous example. “Everybody hateful, I ask Laurie go skating. He always kind jolly, put rights, I know,” said Jo herself, went. Amy heard clash skates, looked impatient exclamation. “There! She promised I go next time, last ice shall have. But use ask crosspatch take me.” “Do say that. You naughty, hard forgive loss precious little book, I think might now, I guess will, try right minute,” said Meg. “Go them. Do say anything till Jo got good-natured Laurie, take quiet minute kiss her, kind thing, I sure friends heart.” “I try,” said Amy, advice suited her, flurry get ready, ran friends, disappearing hill. It far river, ready Amy reached them. Jo saw coming, turned back. Laurie see, carefully skating along shore, sounding ice, warm spell preceded cold snap. “I go first bend, see right begin race,” Amy heard say, shot away, looking like young Russian fur-trimmed coat cap. Jo heard Amy panting run, stamping feet blowing fingers tried put skates on, Jo never turned went slowly zigzagging river, taking bitter, unhappy sort satisfaction sister’s troubles. She cherished anger till grew strong took possession her, evil thoughts feelings always unless cast once. As Laurie turned bend, shouted back... “Keep near shore. It safe middle.” Jo heard, Amy struggling feet catch word. Jo glanced shoulder, little demon harboring said ear... “No matter whether heard not, let take care herself.” Laurie vanished round bend, Jo turn, Amy, far behind, striking toward smoother ice middle river. For minute Jo stood still strange feeling heart, resolved go on, something held turned round, time see Amy throw hands go down, sudden crash rotten ice, splash water, cry made Jo’s heart stand still fear. She tried call Laurie, voice gone. She tried rush forward, feet seemed strength them, second, could stand motionless, staring terror-stricken face little blue hood black water. Something rushed swiftly her, Laurie’s voice cried out... “Bring rail. Quick, quick!” How it, never knew, next minutes worked possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, quite self-possessed, lying flat, held Amy arm hockey stick till Jo dragged rail fence, together got child out, frightened hurt. “Now then, must walk home fast can. Pile things her, I get confounded skates,” cried Laurie, wrapping coat round Amy, tugging away straps never seemed intricate before. Shivering, dripping, crying, got Amy home, exciting time it, fell asleep, rolled blankets hot fire. During bustle Jo scarcely spoken flown about, looking pale wild, things half off, dress torn, hands cut bruised ice rails refractory buckles. When Amy comfortably asleep, house quiet, Mrs. March sitting bed, called Jo began bind hurt hands. “Are sure safe?” whispered Jo, looking remorsefully golden head, might swept away sight forever treacherous ice. “Quite safe, dear. She hurt, even take cold, I think, sensible covering getting home quickly,” replied mother cheerfully. “Laurie all. I let go. Mother, die, would fault.” And Jo dropped beside bed passion penitent tears, telling happened, bitterly condemning hardness heart, sobbing gratitude spared heavy punishment might come upon her. “It dreadful temper! I try cure it, I think I have, breaks worse ever. Oh, Mother, shall I do? What shall I do?” cried poor Jo, despair. “Watch pray, dear, never get tired trying, never think impossible conquer fault,” said Mrs. March, drawing blowzy head shoulder kissing wet cheek tenderly Jo cried even harder. “You know, cannot guess bad is! It seems I could anything I passion. I get savage, I could hurt anyone enjoy it. I afraid I shall something dreadful day, spoil life, make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help me, help me!” “I will, child, I will. Do cry bitterly, remember day, resolve soul never know another like it. Jo, dear, temptations, far greater yours, often takes us lives conquer them. You think temper worst world, mine used like it.” “Yours, Mother? Why, never angry!” And moment Jo forgot remorse surprise. “I trying cure forty years, succeeded controlling it. I angry nearly every day life, Jo, I learned show it, I still hope learn feel it, though may take another forty years so.” The patience humility face loved well better lesson Jo wisest lecture, sharpest reproof. She felt comforted sympathy confidence given her. The knowledge mother fault like hers, tried mend it, made easier bear strengthened resolution cure it, though forty years seemed rather long time watch pray girl fifteen. “Mother, angry fold lips tight together go room sometimes, Aunt March scolds people worry you?” asked Jo, feeling nearer dearer mother ever before. “Yes, I learned check hasty words rise lips, I feel mean break will, I go away minute, give little shake weak wicked,” answered Mrs. March sigh smile, smoothed fastened Jo’s disheveled hair. “How learn keep still? That troubles me, sharp words fly I know I about, I say worse I get, till pleasure hurt people’s feelings say dreadful things. Tell it, Marmee dear.” “My good mother used help me...” “As us...” interrupted Jo, grateful kiss. “But I lost I little older are, years struggle alone, I proud confess weakness anyone else. I hard time, Jo, would good many bitter tears failures, spite efforts I never seemed get on. Then father came, I happy I found easy good. But by-and-by, I four little daughters round poor, old trouble began again, I patient nature, tried much see children wanting anything.” “Poor Mother! What helped then?” “Your father, Jo. He never loses patience, never doubts complains, always hopes, works waits cheerfully one ashamed otherwise him. He helped comforted me, showed I must try practice virtues I would little girls possess, I example. It easier try sakes own. A startled surprised look one I spoke sharply rebuked words could done, love, respect, confidence children sweetest reward I could receive efforts woman I would copy.” “Oh, Mother, I ever half good you, I shall satisfied,” cried Jo, much touched. “I hope great deal better, dear, must keep watch ‘bosom enemy’, father calls it, may sadden, spoil life. You warning. Remember it, try heart soul master quick temper, brings greater sorrow regret known today.” “I try, Mother, I truly will. But must help me, remind me, keep flying out. I used see Father sometimes put finger lips, look kind sober face, always folded lips tight went away. Was reminding then?” asked Jo softly. “Yes. I asked help so, never forgot it, saved many sharp word little gesture kind look.” Jo saw mother’s eyes filled lips trembled spoke, fearing said much, whispered anxiously, “Was wrong watch speak it? I mean rude, comfortable say I think you, feel safe happy here.” “My Jo, may say anything mother, greatest happiness pride feel girls confide know much I love them.” “I thought I would grieved you.” “No, dear, speaking Father reminded much I miss him, much I owe him, faithfully I watch work keep little daughters safe good him.” “Yet told go, Mother, cry went, never complain now, seem needed help,” said Jo, wondering. “I gave best country I love, kept tears till gone. Why I complain, merely done duty surely happier end? If I seem need help, I better friend, even Father, comfort sustain me. My child, troubles temptations life beginning may many, overcome outlive learn feel strength tenderness Heavenly Father earthly one. The love trust Him, nearer feel Him, less depend human power wisdom. His love care never tire change, never taken you, may become source lifelong peace, happiness, strength. Believe heartily, go God little cares, hopes, sins, sorrows, freely confidingly come mother.” Jo’s answer hold mother close, silence followed sincerest prayer ever prayed left heart without words. For sad yet happy hour, learned bitterness remorse despair, sweetness self-denial self-control, led mother’s hand, drawn nearer Friend always welcomes every child love stronger father, tenderer mother. Amy stirred sighed sleep, eager begin mend fault, Jo looked expression face never worn before. “I let sun go anger. I would forgive her, today, Laurie, might late! How could I wicked?” said Jo, half aloud, leaned sister softly stroking wet hair scattered pillow. As heard, Amy opened eyes, held arms, smile went straight Jo’s heart. Neither said word, hugged one another close, spite blankets, everything forgiven forgotten one hearty kiss. CHAPTER NINE MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR “I think fortunate thing world children measles now,” said Meg, one April day, stood packing ‘go abroady’ trunk room, surrounded sisters. “And nice Annie Moffat forget promise. A whole fortnight fun regularly splendid,” replied Jo, looking like windmill folded skirts long arms. “And lovely weather, I glad that,” added Beth, tidily sorting neck hair ribbons best box, lent great occasion. “I wish I going fine time wear nice things,” said Amy mouth full pins, artistically replenished sister’s cushion. “I wish going, cannot, I shall keep adventures tell I come back. I sure least I kind, lending things helping get ready,” said Meg, glancing round room simple outfit, seemed nearly perfect eyes. “What Mother give treasure box?” asked Amy, present opening certain cedar chest Mrs. March kept relics past splendor, gifts girls proper time came. “A pair silk stockings, pretty carved fan, lovely blue sash. I wanted violet silk, time make over, I must contented old tarlaton.” “It look nice new muslin skirt, sash set beautifully. I wish I smashed coral bracelet, might it,” said Jo, loved give lend, whose possessions usually dilapidated much use. “There lovely old-fashioned pearl set treasure chest, Mother said real flowers prettiest ornament young girl, Laurie promised send I want,” replied Meg. “Now, let see, new gray walking suit, curl feather hat, Beth, poplin Sunday small party, looks heavy spring, it? The violet silk would nice. Oh, dear!” “Never mind, got tarlaton big party, always look like angel white,” said Amy, brooding little store finery soul delighted. “It low-necked, sweep enough, do. My blue housedress looks well, turned freshly trimmed, I feel I would got new one. My silk sacque bit fashion, bonnet look like Sallie’s. I like say anything, I sadly disappointed umbrella. I told Mother black white handle, forgot bought green one yellowish handle. It strong neat, I ought complain, I know I shall feel ashamed beside Annie’s silk one gold top,” sighed Meg, surveying little umbrella great disfavor. “Change it,” advised Jo. “I silly, hurt Marmee’s feelings, took much pains get things. It nonsensical notion mine, I going give it. My silk stockings two pairs new gloves comfort. You dear lend yours, Jo. I feel rich sort elegant, two new pairs, old ones cleaned common.” And Meg took refreshing peep glove box. “Annie Moffat blue pink bows nightcaps. Would put mine?” asked, Beth brought pile snowy muslins, fresh Hannah’s hands. “No, I would not, smart caps match plain gowns without trimming them. Poor folks rig,” said Jo decidedly. “I wonder I shall ever happy enough real lace clothes bows caps?” said Meg impatiently. “You said day would perfectly happy could go Annie Moffat’s,” observed Beth quiet way. “So I did! Well, I happy, I fret, seem one gets one wants, it? There now, trays ready, everything ball dress, I shall leave Mother pack,” said Meg, cheering up, glanced half-filled trunk many times pressed mended white tarlaton, called ‘ball dress’ important air. The next day fine, Meg departed style fortnight novelty pleasure. Mrs. March consented visit rather reluctantly, fearing Margaret would come back discontented went. But begged hard, Sallie promised take good care her, little pleasure seemed delightful winter irksome work mother yielded, daughter went take first taste fashionable life. The Moffats fashionable, simple Meg rather daunted, first, splendor house elegance occupants. But kindly people, spite frivolous life led, soon put guest ease. Perhaps Meg felt, without understanding why, particularly cultivated intelligent people, gilding could quite conceal ordinary material made. It certainly agreeable fare sumptuously, drive fine carriage, wear best frock every day, nothing enjoy herself. It suited exactly, soon began imitate manners conversation her, put little airs graces, use French phrases, crimp hair, take dresses, talk fashions well could. The saw Annie Moffat’s pretty things, envied sighed rich. Home looked bare dismal thought it, work grew harder ever, felt destitute much-injured girl, spite new gloves silk stockings. She much time repining, however, three young girls busily employed ‘having good time’. They shopped, walked, rode, called day, went theaters operas frolicked home evening, Annie many friends knew entertain them. Her older sisters fine young ladies, one engaged, extremely interesting romantic, Meg thought. Mr. Moffat fat, jolly old gentleman, knew father, Mrs. Moffat, fat, jolly old lady, took great fancy Meg daughter done. Everyone petted her, ‘Daisey’, called her, fair way head turned. When evening small party came, found poplin would all, girls putting thin dresses making fine indeed. So came tarlatan, looking older, limper, shabbier ever beside Sallie’s crisp new one. Meg saw girls glance one another, cheeks began burn, gentleness proud. No one said word it, Sallie offered dress hair, Annie tie sash, Belle, engaged sister, praised white arms. But kindness Meg saw pity poverty, heart felt heavy stood herself, others laughed, chattered, flew like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter feeling getting pretty bad, maid brought box flowers. Before could speak, Annie cover off, exclaiming lovely roses, heath, fern within. “It Belle, course, George always sends some, altogether ravishing,” cried Annie, great sniff. “They Miss March, man said. And note,” put maid, holding Meg. “What fun! Who from? Did know lover,” cried girls, fluttering Meg high state curiosity surprise. “The note Mother, flowers Laurie,” said Meg simply, yet much gratified forgotten her. “Oh, indeed!” said Annie funny look, Meg slipped note pocket sort talisman envy, vanity, false pride, loving words done good, flowers cheered beauty. Feeling almost happy again, laid ferns roses herself, quickly made rest dainty bouquets breasts, hair, skirts friends, offering prettily Clara, elder sister, told ‘the sweetest little thing ever saw’, looked quite charmed small attention. Somehow kind act finished despondency, rest went show Mrs. Moffat, saw happy, bright-eyed face mirror, laid ferns rippling hair fastened roses dress strike shabby now. She enjoyed much evening, danced heart’s content. Everyone kind, three compliments. Annie made sing, one said remarkably fine voice. Major Lincoln asked ‘the fresh little girl beautiful eyes’ was, Mr. Moffat insisted dancing ‘did dawdle, spring her’, gracefully expressed it. So altogether nice time, till overheard bit conversation, disturbed extremely. She sitting inside conservatory, waiting partner bring ice, heard voice ask side flowery wall... “How old he?” “Sixteen seventeen, I say,” replied another voice. “It would grand thing one girls, would it? Sallie says intimate now, old man quite dotes them.” “Mrs. M. made plans, I dare say, play cards well, early is. The girl evidently think yet,” said Mrs. Moffat. “She told fib momma, know, colored flowers came quite prettily. Poor thing! She would nice got style. Do think would offended offered lend dress Thursday?” asked another voice. “She proud, I believe would mind, dowdy tarlaton got. She may tear tonight, good excuse offering decent one.” Here Meg’s partner appeared, find looking much flushed rather agitated. She proud, pride useful then, helped hide mortification, anger, disgust heard. For, innocent unsuspicious was, could help understanding gossip friends. She tried forget it, could not, kept repeating herself, “Mrs. M. made plans,” “that fib mamma,” “dowdy tarlaton,” till ready cry rush home tell troubles ask advice. As impossible, best seem gay, rather excited, succeeded well one dreamed effort making. She glad quiet bed, could think wonder fume till head ached hot cheeks cooled natural tears. Those foolish, yet well meant words, opened new world Meg, much disturbed peace old one till lived happily child. Her innocent friendship Laurie spoiled silly speeches overheard. Her faith mother little shaken worldly plans attributed Mrs. Moffat, judged others herself, sensible resolution contented simple wardrobe suited poor man’s daughter weakened unnecessary pity girls thought shabby dress one greatest calamities heaven. Poor Meg restless night, got heavy-eyed, unhappy, half resentful toward friends, half ashamed speaking frankly setting everything right. Everybody dawdled morning, noon girls found energy enough even take worsted work. Something manner friends struck Meg once. They treated respect, thought, took quite tender interest said, looked eyes plainly betrayed curiosity. All surprised flattered her, though understand till Miss Belle looked writing, said, sentimental air... “Daisy, dear, I sent invitation friend, Mr. Laurence, Thursday. We like know him, proper compliment you.” Meg colored, mischievous fancy tease girls made reply demurely, “You kind, I afraid come.” “Why not, Cherie?” asked Miss Belle. “He old.” “My child, mean? What age, I beg know!” cried Miss Clara. “Nearly seventy, I believe,” answered Meg, counting stitches hide merriment eyes. “You sly creature! Of course meant young man,” exclaimed Miss Belle, laughing. “There any, Laurie little boy.” And Meg laughed also queer look sisters exchanged thus described supposed lover. “About age,” Nan said. “Nearer sister Jo’s; I seventeen August,” returned Meg, tossing head. “It nice send flowers, it?” said Annie, looking wise nothing. “Yes, often does, us, house full, fond them. My mother old Mr. Laurence friends, know, quite natural children play together,” Meg hoped would say more. “It evident Daisy yet,” said Miss Clara Belle nod. “Quite pastoral state innocence round,” returned Miss Belle shrug. “I going get little matters girls. Can I anything you, young ladies?” asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering like elephant silk lace. “No, thank you, madam,” replied Sallie. “I got new pink silk Thursday want thing.” “Nor I...” began Meg, stopped occurred want several things could them. “What shall wear?” asked Sallie. “My old white one again, I mend fit seen, got sadly torn last night,” said Meg, trying speak quite easily, feeling uncomfortable. “Why send home another?” said Sallie, observing young lady. “I got other.” It cost Meg effort say that, Sallie see exclaimed amiable surprise, “Only that? How funny...” She finish speech, Belle shook head broke in, saying kindly... “Not all. Where use lot dresses yet? There need sending home, Daisy, even dozen, I got sweet blue silk laid away, I outgrown, shall wear please me, you, dear?” “You kind, I mind old dress not, well enough little girl like me,” said Meg. “Now let please dressing style. I admire it, would regular little beauty touch there. I shall let anyone see till done, burst upon like Cinderella godmother going ball,” said Belle persuasive tone. Meg could refuse offer kindly made, desire see would ‘a little beauty’ touching caused accept forget former uncomfortable feelings toward Moffats. On Thursday evening, Belle shut maid, turned Meg fine lady. They crimped curled hair, polished neck arms fragrant powder, touched lips coralline salve make redder, Hortense would added ‘a soupcon rouge’, Meg rebelled. They laced sky-blue dress, tight could hardly breathe low neck modest Meg blushed mirror. A set silver filagree added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, even earrings, Hortense tied bit pink silk show. A cluster tea-rose buds bosom, ruche, reconciled Meg display pretty, white shoulders, pair high-heeled silk boots satisfied last wish heart. A lace handkerchief, plumy fan, bouquet shoulder holder finished off, Miss Belle surveyed satisfaction little girl newly dressed doll. “Mademoiselle charmante, tres jolie, not?” cried Hortense, clasping hands affected rapture. “Come show yourself,” said Miss Belle, leading way room others waiting. As Meg went rustling after, long skirts trailing, earrings tinkling, curls waving, heart beating, felt fun really begun last, mirror plainly told ‘a little beauty’. Her friends repeated pleasing phrase enthusiastically, several minutes stood, like jackdaw fable, enjoying borrowed plumes, rest chattered like party magpies. “While I dress, drill her, Nan, management skirt French heels, trip up. Take silver butterfly, catch long curl left side head, Clara, disturb charming work hands,” said Belle, hurried away, looking well pleased success. “You look bit like yourself, nice. I nowhere beside you, Belle heaps taste, quite French, I assure you. Let flowers hang, careful them, sure trip,” returned Sallie, trying care Meg prettier herself. Keeping warning carefully mind, Margaret got safely stairs sailed drawing rooms Moffats early guests assembled. She soon discovered charm fine clothes attracts certain class people secures respect. Several young ladies, taken notice before, affectionate sudden. Several young gentlemen, stared party, stared, asked introduced, said manner foolish agreeable things her, several old ladies, sat sofas, criticized rest party, inquired air interest. She heard Mrs. Moffat reply one them... “Daisy March—father colonel army—one first families, reverses fortune, know; intimate friends Laurences; sweet creature, I assure you; Ned quite wild her.” “Dear me!” said old lady, putting glass another observation Meg, tried look heard rather shocked Mrs. Moffat’s fibs. The ‘queer feeling’ pass away, imagined acting new part fine lady got pretty well, though tight dress gave side-ache, train kept getting feet, constant fear lest earrings fly get lost broken. She flirting fan laughing feeble jokes young gentleman tried witty, suddenly stopped laughing looked confused, opposite, saw Laurie. He staring undisguised surprise, disapproval also, thought, though bowed smiled, yet something honest eyes made blush wish old dress on. To complete confusion, saw Belle nudge Annie, glance Laurie, who, happy see, looked unusually boyish shy. “Silly creatures, put thoughts head. I care it, let change bit,” thought Meg, rustled across room shake hands friend. “I glad came, I afraid would not.” said, grown-up air. “Jo wanted come, tell looked, I did,” answered Laurie, without turning eyes upon her, though half smiled maternal tone. “What shall tell her?” asked Meg, full curiosity know opinion her, yet feeling ill ease first time. “I shall say I know you, look grown-up unlike yourself, I quite afraid you,” said, fumbling glove button. “How absurd you! The girls dressed fun, I rather like it. Would Jo stare saw me?” said Meg, bent making say whether thought improved not. “Yes, I think would,” returned Laurie gravely. “Do like so?” asked Meg. “No, I not,” blunt reply. “Why not?” anxious tone. He glanced frizzled head, bare shoulders, fantastically trimmed dress expression abashed answer, particle usual politeness it. “I like fuss feathers.” That altogether much lad younger herself, Meg walked away, saying petulantly, “You rudest boy I ever saw.” Feeling much ruffled, went stood quiet window cool cheeks, tight dress gave uncomfortably brilliant color. As stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, minute heard saying mother... “They making fool little girl. I wanted see her, spoiled entirely. She nothing doll tonight.” “Oh, dear!” sighed Meg. “I wish I would sensible worn things, I disgusted people, felt uncomfortable ashamed myself.” She leaned forehead cool pane, stood half hidden curtains, never minding favorite waltz begun, till one touched her, turning, saw Laurie, looking penitent, said, best bow hand out... “Please forgive rudeness, come dance me.” “I afraid disagreeable you,” said Meg, trying look offended failing entirely. “Not bit it, I dying it. Come, I good. I like gown, I think splendid.” And waved hands, words failed express admiration. Meg smiled relented, whispered stood waiting catch time, “Take care skirt trip up. It plague life I goose wear it.” “Pin round neck, useful,” said Laurie, looking little blue boots, evidently approved of. Away went fleetly gracefully, practiced home, well matched, blithe young couple pleasant sight see, twirled merrily round round, feeling friendly ever small tiff. “Laurie, I want favor, you?” said Meg, stood fanning breath gave out, soon though would why. “Will I!” said Laurie, alacrity. “Please tell home dress tonight. They understand joke, worry Mother.” “Then it?” said Laurie’s eyes, plainly Meg hastily added... “I shall tell it, ‘fess’ Mother silly I been. But I would rather myself. So tell, you?” “I give word I not, shall I say ask me?” “Just say I looked pretty well good time.” “I say first heart, other? You look good time. Are you?” And Laurie looked expression made answer whisper... “No, now. Do think I horrid. I wanted little fun, sort pay, I find, I getting tired it.” “Here comes Ned Moffat. What want?” said Laurie, knitting black brows regard young host light pleasant addition party. “He put name three dances, I suppose coming them. What bore!” said Meg, assuming languid air amused Laurie immensely. He speak till suppertime, saw drinking champagne Ned friend Fisher, behaving ‘like pair fools’, Laurie said himself, felt brotherly sort right watch Marches fight battles whenever defender needed. “You splitting headache tomorrow, drink much that. I would not, Meg, mother like it, know,” whispered, leaning chair, Ned turned refill glass Fisher stooped pick fan. “I Meg tonight, I ‘a doll’ sorts crazy things. Tomorrow I shall put away ‘fuss feathers’ desperately good again,” answered affected little laugh. “Wish tomorrow here, then,” muttered Laurie, walking off, ill-pleased change saw her. Meg danced flirted, chattered giggled, girls did. After supper undertook German, blundered it, nearly upsetting partner long skirt, romping way scandalized Laurie, looked meditated lecture. But got chance deliver it, Meg kept away till came say good night. “Remember!” said, trying smile, splitting headache already begun. “Silence la mort,” replied Laurie, melodramatic flourish, went away. This little bit byplay excited Annie’s curiosity, Meg tired gossip went bed, feeling masquerade enjoyed much expected. She sick next day, Saturday went home, quite used fortnight’s fun feeling ‘sat lap luxury’ long enough. “It seem pleasant quiet, company manners time. Home nice place, though splendid,” said Meg, looking restful expression, sat mother Jo Sunday evening. “I glad hear say so, dear, I afraid home would seem dull poor fine quarters,” replied mother, given many anxious looks day. For motherly eyes quick see change children’s faces. Meg told adventures gayly said charming time had, something still seemed weigh upon spirits, younger girls gone bed, sat thoughtfully staring fire, saying little looking worried. As clock struck nine Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left chair and, taking Beth’s stool, leaned elbows mother’s knee, saying bravely... “Marmee, I want ‘fess’.” “I thought so. What it, dear?” “Shall I go away?” asked Jo discreetly. “Of course not. Do I always tell everything? I ashamed speak younger children, I want know dreadful things I Moffats’.” “We prepared,” said Mrs. March, smiling looking little anxious. “I told dressed up, I tell powdered squeezed frizzled, made look like fashion-plate. Laurie thought I proper. I know did, though say so, one man called ‘a doll’. I knew silly, flattered said I beauty, quantities nonsense, I let make fool me.” “Is all?” asked Jo, Mrs. March looked silently downcast face pretty daughter, could find heart blame little follies. “No, I drank champagne romped tried flirt, altogether abominable,” said Meg self-reproachfully. “There something more, I think.” And Mrs. March smoothed soft cheek, suddenly grew rosy Meg answered slowly... “Yes. It silly, I want tell it, I hate people say think things us Laurie.” Then told various bits gossip heard Moffats’, spoke, Jo saw mother fold lips tightly, ill pleased ideas put Meg’s innocent mind. “Well, greatest rubbish I ever heard,” cried Jo indignantly. “Why pop tell spot?” “I could not, embarrassing me. I could help hearing first, I angry ashamed, I remember I ought go away.” “Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, I show settle ridiculous stuff. The idea ‘plans’ kind Laurie rich may marry us by-and-by! Will shout I tell silly things say us poor children?” And Jo laughed, second thoughts thing struck good joke. “If tell Laurie, I never forgive you! She must not, must she, Mother?” said Meg, looking distressed. “No, never repeat foolish gossip, forget soon can,” said Mrs. March gravely. “I unwise let go among people I know little, kind, I dare say, worldly, ill-bred, full vulgar ideas young people. I sorry I express mischief visit may done you, Meg.” “Do sorry, I let hurt me. I forget bad remember good, I enjoy great deal, thank much letting go. I sentimental dissatisfied, Mother. I know I silly little girl, I stay till I fit take care myself. But nice praised admired, I cannot help saying I like it,” said Meg, looking half ashamed confession. “That perfectly natural, quite harmless, liking become passion lead one foolish unmaidenly things. Learn know value praise worth having, excite admiration excellent people modest well pretty, Meg.” Margaret sat thinking moment, Jo stood hands behind her, looking interested little perplexed, new thing see Meg blushing talking admiration, lovers, things sort. And Jo felt fortnight sister grown amazingly, drifting away world could follow. “Mother, ‘plans’, Mrs. Moffat said?” asked Meg bashfully. “Yes, dear, I great many, mothers do, mine differ somewhat Mrs. Moffat’s, I suspect. I tell them, time come word may set romantic little head heart right, serious subject. You young, Meg, young understand me, mothers’ lips fittest speak things girls like you. Jo, turn come time, perhaps, listen ‘plans’ help carry out, good.” Jo went sat one arm chair, looking thought join solemn affair. Holding hand each, watching two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, serious yet cheery way... “I want daughters beautiful, accomplished, good. To admired, loved, respected. To happy youth, well wisely married, lead useful, pleasant lives, little care sorrow try God sees fit send. To loved chosen good man best sweetest thing happen woman, I sincerely hope girls may know beautiful experience. It natural think it, Meg, right hope wait it, wise prepare it, happy time comes, may feel ready duties worthy joy. My dear girls, I ambitious you, make dash world, marry rich men merely rich, splendid houses, homes love wanting. Money needful precious thing, well used, noble thing, I never want think first prize strive for. I would rather see poor men’s wives, happy, beloved, contented, queens thrones, without self-respect peace.” “Poor girls stand chance, Belle says, unless put forward,” sighed Meg. “Then old maids,” said Jo stoutly. “Right, Jo. Better happy old maids unhappy wives, unmaidenly girls, running find husbands,” said Mrs. March decidedly. “Do troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts sincere lover. Some best honored women I know poor girls, love-worthy allowed old maids. Leave things time. Make home happy, may fit homes own, offered you, contented not. One thing remember, girls. Mother always ready confidant, Father friend, us hope trust daughters, whether married single, pride comfort lives.” “We will, Marmee, will!” cried both, hearts, bade good night. CHAPTER TEN THE P.C.

I propose Mr. Theodore Laurence honorary member P. C. Come now, him.” Jo’s sudden change tone made girls laugh, looked rather anxious, one said word Snodgrass took seat. “We put vote,” said President. “All favor motion please manifest saying, ‘Aye’.” A loud response Snodgrass, followed, everybody’s surprise, timid one Beth. “Contrary-minded say, ‘No’.” Meg Amy contrary-minded, Mr. Winkle rose say great elegance, “We wish boys, joke bounce about. This ladies’ club, wish private proper.” “I afraid laugh paper, make fun us afterward,” observed Pickwick, pulling little curl forehead, always doubtful. Up rose Snodgrass, much earnest. “Sir, I give word gentleman, Laurie anything sort. He likes write, give tone contributions keep us sentimental, see? We little him, much us, I think least offer place here, make welcome comes.” This artful allusion benefits conferred brought Tupman feet, looking quite made mind. “Yes; ought it, even afraid. I say may come, grandpa, too, likes.” This spirited burst Beth electrified club, Jo left seat shake hands approvingly. “Now then, vote again. Everybody remember Laurie, say, ‘Aye!’” cried Snodgrass excitedly. “Aye! Aye! Aye!” replied three voices once. “Good! Bless you! Now, nothing like ‘taking time fetlock’, Winkle characteristically observes, allow present new member.” And, dismay rest club, Jo threw open door closet, displayed Laurie sitting rag bag, flushed twinkling suppressed laughter. “You rogue! You traitor!

But new member equal occasion, rising, grateful salutation Chair, said engaging manner, “Mr. President ladies—I beg pardon, gentlemen—allow introduce Sam Weller, humble servant club.” “Good!

A long discussion followed, everyone came surprising, everyone best. So unusually lively meeting, adjourn till late hour, broke three shrill cheers new member. No one ever regretted admittance Sam Weller, devoted, well-behaved, jovial member club could have. He certainly add ‘spirit’ meetings, ‘a tone’ paper, orations convulsed hearers contributions excellent, patriotic, classical, comical, dramatic, never sentimental. Jo regarded worthy Bacon, Milton, Shakespeare, remodeled works good effect, thought. The P. O. capital little institution, flourished wonderfully, nearly many queer things passed real post office. Tragedies cravats, poetry pickles, garden seeds long letters, music gingerbread, rubbers, invitations, scoldings, puppies. The old gentleman liked fun, amused sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, funny telegrams, gardener, smitten Hannah’s charms, actually sent love letter Jo’s care. How laughed secret came out, never dreaming many love letters little post office would hold years come. CHAPTER ELEVEN EXPERIMENTS “The first June! The Kings seashore tomorrow, I free. Three months’ vacation—how I shall enjoy it!” exclaimed Meg, coming home one warm day find Jo laid upon sofa unusual state exhaustion, Beth took dusty boots, Amy made lemonade refreshment whole party. “Aunt March went today, which, oh, joyful!” said Jo. “I mortally afraid would ask go her. If had, I felt I ought it, Plumfield gay churchyard, know, I would rather excused. We flurry getting old lady off, I fright every time spoke me, I hurry I uncommonly helpful sweet, feared would find impossible part me. I quaked till fairly carriage, final fright, drove of, popped head, saying, ‘Josyphine, you—?’ I hear more, I basely turned fled. I actually run, whisked round corner I felt safe.” “Poor old Jo! She came looking bears her,” said Beth, cuddled sister’s feet motherly air. “Aunt March regular samphire, not?” observed Amy, tasting mixture critically. “She means vampire, seaweed, matter. It warm particular one’s parts speech,” murmured Jo. “What shall vacation?” asked Amy, changing subject tact. “I shall lie abed late, nothing,” replied Meg, depths rocking chair. “I routed early winter spend days working people, I going rest revel heart’s content.” “No,” said Jo, “that dozy way would suit me. I laid heap books, I going improve shining hours reading perch old apple tree, I l——” “Do say ‘larks!’” implored Amy, return snub ‘samphire’ correction. “I say ‘nightingales’ then, Laurie. That proper appropriate, since warbler.” “Do let us lessons, Beth, while, play time rest, girls mean to,” proposed Amy. “Well, I will, Mother mind. I want learn new songs, children need fitting summer. They dreadfully order really suffering clothes.” “May we, Mother?” asked Meg, turning Mrs. March, sat sewing called ‘Marmee’s corner’. “You may try experiment week see like it. I think Saturday night find play work bad work play.” “Oh, dear, no! It delicious, I sure,” said Meg complacently. “I propose toast, ‘friend pardner, Sairy Gamp’, says. Fun forever, grubbing!” cried Jo, rising, glass hand, lemonade went round. They drank merrily, began experiment lounging rest day. Next morning, Meg appear till ten clock. Her solitary breakfast taste good, room seemed lonely untidy, Jo filled vases, Beth dusted, Amy’s books lay scattered about. Nothing neat pleasant ‘Marmee’s corner’, looked usual. And Meg sat, ‘rest read’, meant yawn imagine pretty summer dresses would get salary. Jo spent morning river Laurie afternoon reading crying _The Wide, Wide World_, apple tree. Beth began rummaging everything big closet family resided, getting tired half done, left establishment topsy-turvy went music, rejoicing dishes wash. Amy arranged bower, put best white frock, smoothed curls, sat draw honeysuckle, hoping someone would see inquire young artist was. As one appeared inquisitive daddy-longlegs, examined work interest, went walk, got caught shower, came home dripping. At teatime compared notes, agreed delightful, though unusually long day. Meg, went shopping afternoon got ‘sweet blue muslin’, discovered, cut breadths off, would wash, mishap made slightly cross. Jo burned skin nose boating, got raging headache reading long. Beth worried confusion closet difficulty learning three four songs once, Amy deeply regretted damage done frock, Katy Brown’s party next day like Flora McFlimsey, ‘nothing wear’. But mere trifles, assured mother experiment working finely. She smiled, said nothing, Hannah’s help neglected work, keeping home pleasant domestic machinery running smoothly. It astonishing peculiar uncomfortable state things produced ‘resting reveling’ process. The days kept getting longer longer, weather unusually variable tempers; unsettled feeling possessed everyone, Satan found plenty mischief idle hands do. As height luxury, Meg put sewing, found time hang heavily, fell snipping spoiling clothes attempts furbish la Moffat. Jo read till eyes gave sick books, got fidgety even good-natured Laurie quarrel her, reduced spirits desperately wished gone Aunt March. Beth got pretty well, constantly forgetting play work, fell back old ways then. But something air affected her, tranquility much disturbed, much one occasion actually shook poor dear Joanna told ‘a fright’. Amy fared worst all, resources small, sisters left amuse herself, soon found accomplished important little self great burden. She like dolls, fairy tales childish, one could draw time. Tea parties amount much, neither picnics, unless well conducted. “If one could fine house, full nice girls, go traveling, summer would delightful, stay home three selfish sisters grown-up boy enough try patience Boaz,” complained Miss Malaprop, several days devoted pleasure, fretting, ennui. No one would tired experiment, Friday night acknowledged glad week nearly done. Hoping impress lesson deeply, Mrs. March, good deal humor, resolved finish trial appropriate manner, gave Hannah holiday let girls enjoy full effect play system. When got Saturday morning, fire kitchen, breakfast dining room, mother anywhere seen. “Mercy us! What happened?” cried Jo, staring dismay. Meg ran upstairs soon came back again, looking relieved rather bewildered, little ashamed. “Mother sick, tired, says going stay quietly room day let us best can. It queer thing do, act bit like herself. But says hard week her, must grumble take care ourselves.” “That easy enough, I like idea, I aching something do, is, new amusement, know,” added Jo quickly. In fact immense relief little work, took hold will, soon realized truth Hannah’s saying, “Housekeeping joke.” There plenty food larder, Beth Amy set table, Meg Jo got breakfast, wondering servants ever talked hard work. “I shall take Mother, though said think her, would take care herself,” said Meg, presided felt quite matronly behind teapot. So tray fitted anyone began, taken cook’s compliments. The boiled tea bitter, omelet scorched, biscuits speckled saleratus, Mrs. March received repast thanks laughed heartily Jo gone. “Poor little souls, hard time, I afraid, suffer, good,” said, producing palatable viands provided herself, disposing bad breakfast, feelings might hurt, motherly little deception grateful. Many complaints below, great chagrin head cook failures. “Never mind, I get dinner servant, mistress, keep hands nice, see company, give orders,” said Jo, knew still less Meg culinary affairs. This obliging offer gladly accepted, Margaret retired parlor, hastily put order whisking litter sofa shutting blinds save trouble dusting. Jo, perfect faith powers friendly desire make quarrel, immediately put note office, inviting Laurie dinner. “You would better see got think company,” said Meg, informed hospitable rash act. “Oh, corned beef plenty potatoes, I shall get asparagus lobster, ‘for relish’, Hannah says. We lettuce make salad. I know how, book tells. I blanc mange strawberries dessert, coffee too, want elegant.” “Do try many messes, Jo, cannot make anything gingerbread molasses candy fit eat. I wash hands dinner party, since asked Laurie responsibility, may take care him.” “I want anything civil help pudding. You give advice I get muddle, you?” asked Jo, rather hurt. “Yes, I know much, except bread trifles. You better ask Mother’s leave order anything,” returned Meg prudently. “Of course I shall. I fool.” And Jo went huff doubts expressed powers. “Get like, disturb me. I going dinner cannot worry things home,” said Mrs. March, Jo spoke her. “I never enjoyed housekeeping, I going take vacation today, read, write, go visiting, amuse myself.” The unusual spectacle busy mother rocking comfortably reading early morning made Jo feel unnatural phenomenon occurred, eclipse, earthquake, volcanic eruption would hardly seemed stranger. “Everything sorts, somehow,” said herself, going downstairs. “There Beth crying, sure sign something wrong family. If Amy bothering, I shake her.” Feeling much sorts herself, Jo hurried parlor find Beth sobbing Pip, canary, lay dead cage little claws pathetically extended, imploring food want died. “It fault, I forgot him, seed drop left. Oh, Pip! Oh, Pip! How could I cruel you?” cried Beth, taking poor thing hands trying restore him. Jo peeped half-open eye, felt little heart, finding stiff cold, shook head, offered domino box coffin. “Put oven, maybe get warm revive,” said Amy hopefully. “He starved, shall baked dead. I make shroud, shall buried garden, I never another bird, never, Pip! I bad one,” murmured Beth, sitting floor pet folded hands. “The funeral shall afternoon, go. Now, cry, Bethy. It pity, nothing goes right week, Pip worst experiment. Make shroud, lay box, dinner party, nice little funeral,” said Jo, beginning feel undertaken good deal. Leaving others console Beth, departed kitchen, discouraging state confusion. Putting big apron, fell work got dishes piled ready washing, discovered fire out. “Here sweet prospect!” muttered Jo, slamming stove door open, poking vigorously among cinders. Having rekindled fire, thought would go market water heated. The walk revived spirits, flattering made good bargains, trudged home again, buying young lobster, old asparagus, two boxes acid strawberries. By time got cleared up, dinner arrived stove red-hot. Hannah left pan bread rise, Meg worked early, set hearth second rising, forgotten it. Meg entertaining Sallie Gardiner parlor, door flew open floury, crocky, flushed, disheveled figure appeared, demanding tartly... “I say, bread ‘riz’ enough runs pans?” Sallie began laugh, Meg nodded lifted eyebrows high would go, caused apparition vanish put sour bread oven without delay. Mrs. March went out, peeping see matters went, also saying word comfort Beth, sat making winding sheet, dear departed lay state domino box. A strange sense helplessness fell upon girls gray bonnet vanished round corner, despair seized minutes later Miss Crocker appeared, said would come dinner. Now lady thin, yellow spinster, sharp nose inquisitive eyes, saw everything gossiped saw. They disliked her, taught kind her, simply old poor friends. So Meg gave easy chair tried entertain her, asked questions, criticized everything, told stories people knew. Language cannot describe anxieties, experiences, exertions Jo underwent morning, dinner served became standing joke. Fearing ask advice, best alone, discovered something energy good necessary make cook. She boiled asparagus hour grieved find heads cooked stalks harder ever. The bread burned black; salad dressing aggravated could make fit eat. The lobster scarlet mystery her, hammered poked till unshelled meager proportions concealed grove lettuce leaves. The potatoes hurried, keep asparagus waiting, done last. The blanc mange lumpy, strawberries ripe looked, skilfully ‘deaconed’. “Well, eat beef bread butter, hungry, mortifying spend whole morning nothing,” thought Jo, rang bell half hour later usual, stood, hot, tired, dispirited, surveying feast spread Laurie, accustomed sorts elegance, Miss Crocker, whose tattling tongue would report far wide. Poor Jo would gladly gone table, one thing another tasted left, Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed, Miss Crocker pursed lips, Laurie talked laughed might give cheerful tone festive scene. Jo’s one strong point fruit, sugared well, pitcher rich cream eat it. Her hot cheeks cooled trifle, drew long breath pretty glass plates went round, everyone looked graciously little rosy islands floating sea cream. Miss Crocker tasted first, made wry face, drank water hastily. Jo, refused, thinking might enough, dwindled sadly picking over, glanced Laurie, eating away manfully, though slight pucker mouth kept eye fixed plate. Amy, fond delicate fare, took heaping spoonful, choked, hid face napkin, left table precipitately. “Oh, it?” exclaimed Jo, trembling. “Salt instead sugar, cream sour,” replied Meg tragic gesture. Jo uttered groan fell back chair, remembering given last hasty powdering berries one two boxes kitchen table, neglected put milk refrigerator. She turned scarlet verge crying, met Laurie’s eyes, would look merry spite heroic efforts. The comical side affair suddenly struck her, laughed till tears ran cheeks. So everyone else, even ‘Croaker’ girls called old lady, unfortunate dinner ended gaily, bread butter, olives fun. “I strength mind enough clear now, sober funeral,” said Jo, rose, Miss Crocker made ready go, eager tell new story another friend’s dinner table. They sober Beth’s sake. Laurie dug grave ferns grove, little Pip laid in, many tears tender-hearted mistress, covered moss, wreath violets chickweed hung stone bore epitaph, composed Jo struggled dinner. Here lies Pip March, Who died 7th June; Loved lamented sore, And forgotten soon. At conclusion ceremonies, Beth retired room, overcome emotion lobster, place repose, beds made, found grief much assuaged beating pillows putting things order. Meg helped Jo clear away remains feast, took half afternoon left tired agreed contented tea toast supper. Laurie took Amy drive, deed charity, sour cream seemed bad effect upon temper. Mrs. March came home find three older girls hard work middle afternoon, glance closet gave idea success one part experiment. Before housewives could rest, several people called, scramble get ready see them. Then tea must got, errands done, one two necessary bits sewing neglected last minute. As twilight fell, dewy still, one one gathered porch June roses budding beautifully, groaned sighed sat down, tired troubled. “What dreadful day been!” began Jo, usually first speak. “It seemed shorter usual, uncomfortable,” said Meg. “Not bit like home,” added Amy. “It cannot seem without Marmee little Pip,” sighed Beth, glancing full eyes empty cage head. “Here Mother, dear, shall another bird tomorrow, want it.” As spoke, Mrs. March came took place among them, looking holiday much pleasanter theirs. “Are satisfied experiment, girls, want another week it?” asked, Beth nestled rest turned toward brightening faces, flowers turn toward sun. “I not!” cried Jo decidedly. “Nor I,” echoed others. “You think then, better duties live little others, you?” “Lounging larking pay,” observed Jo, shaking head. “I tired mean go work something right off.” “Suppose learn plain cooking. That useful accomplishment, woman without,” said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly recollection Jo’s dinner party, met Miss Crocker heard account it. “Mother, go away let everything be, see would get on?” cried Meg, suspicions day. “Yes, I wanted see comfort depends share faithfully. While Hannah I work, got pretty well, though I think happy amiable. So I thought, little lesson, I would show happens everyone thinks herself. Do feel pleasanter help one another, daily duties make leisure sweet comes, bear forbear, home may comfortable lovely us all?” “We do, Mother, do!” cried girls. “Then let advise take little burdens again, though seem heavy sometimes, good us, lighten learn carry them. Work wholesome, plenty everyone. It keeps us ennui mischief, good health spirits, gives us sense power independence better money fashion.” “We work like bees, love too, see not,” said Jo. “I learn plain cooking holiday task, next dinner party I shall success.” “I make set shirts father, instead letting it, Marmee. I I will, though I fond sewing. That better fussing things, plenty nice enough are.” said Meg. “I lessons every day, spend much time music dolls. I stupid thing, ought studying, playing,” Beth’s resolution, Amy followed example heroically declaring, “I shall learn make buttonholes, attend parts speech.” “Very good! Then I quite satisfied experiment, fancy shall repeat it, go extreme delve like slaves. Have regular hours work play, make day useful pleasant, prove understand worth time employing well. Then youth delightful, old age bring regrets, life become beautiful success, spite poverty.” “We remember, Mother!” did. CHAPTER TWELVE CAMP LAURENCE Beth postmistress, for, home, could attend regularly, dearly liked daily task unlocking little door distributing mail. One July day came hands full, went house leaving letters parcels like penny post. “Here posy, Mother! Laurie never forgets that,” said, putting fresh nosegay vase stood ‘Marmee’s corner’, kept supplied affectionate boy. “Miss Meg March, one letter glove,” continued Beth, delivering articles sister, sat near mother, stitching wristbands. “Why, I left pair there, one,” said Meg, looking gray cotton glove. “Did drop garden?” “No, I sure I not, one office.” “I hate odd gloves! Never mind, may found. My letter translation German song I wanted. I think Mr. Brooke it, Laurie’s writing.” Mrs. March glanced Meg, looking pretty gingham morning gown, little curls blowing forehead, womanly, sat sewing little worktable, full tidy white rolls, unconscious thought mother’s mind sewed sang, fingers flew thoughts busied girlish fancies innocent fresh pansies belt, Mrs. March smiled satisfied. “Two letters Doctor Jo, book, funny old hat, covered whole post office stuck outside,” said Beth, laughing went study Jo sat writing. “What sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats fashion, I burn face every hot day. He said, ‘Why mind fashion? Wear big hat, comfortable!’ I said I would I one, sent this, try me. I wear fun, show I care fashion.” And hanging antique broad-brim bust Plato, Jo read letters. One mother made cheeks glow eyes fill, said her... My Dear: I write little word tell much satisfaction I watch efforts control temper. You say nothing trials, failures, successes, think, perhaps, one sees Friend whose help daily ask, I may trust well-worn cover guidebook.

Feeling stronger ever meet subdue Apollyon, pinned note inside frock, shield reminder, lest taken unaware, proceeded open letter, quite ready either good bad news. In big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote... Dear Jo, What ho! Some English girls boys coming see tomorrow I want jolly time.

I shall row tramp about, I want starch think of. You come, Betty?” “If let boys talk me.” “Not boy!” “I like please Laurie, I afraid Mr. Brooke, kind. But I want play, sing, say anything. I work hard trouble anyone, take care me, Jo, I go.” “That good girl. You try fight shyness, I love it. Fighting faults easy, I know, cheery word kind gives lift.

When sun peeped girls’ room early next morning promise fine day, saw comical sight. Each made preparation fete seemed necessary proper. Meg extra row little curlpapers across forehead, Jo copiously anointed afflicted face cold cream, Beth taken Joanna bed atone approaching separation, Amy capped climax putting clothespin nose uplift offending feature. It one kind artists use hold paper drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate effective purpose put. This funny spectacle appeared amuse sun, burst radiance Jo woke roused sisters hearty laugh Amy’s ornament. Sunshine laughter good omens pleasure party, soon lively bustle began houses. Beth, ready first, kept reporting went next door, enlivened sisters’ toilets frequent telegrams window. “There goes man tent! I see Mrs. Barker lunch hamper great basket.

Laurie ran meet present friends cordial manner. The lawn reception room, several minutes lively scene enacted there. Meg grateful see Miss Kate, though twenty, dressed simplicity American girls would well imitate, much flattered Mr. Ned’s assurances came especially see her. Jo understood Laurie ‘primmed mouth’ speaking Kate, young lady standoff-do not-touch-me air, contrasted strongly free easy demeanor girls. Beth took observation new boys decided lame one ‘dreadful’, gentle feeble, would kind account. Amy found Grace well-mannered, merry, little person, staring dumbly one another minutes, suddenly became good friends. Tents, lunch, croquet utensils sent beforehand, party soon embarked, two boats pushed together, leaving Mr. Laurence waving hat shore. Laurie Jo rowed one boat, Mr. Brooke Ned other, Fred Vaughn, riotous twin, best upset paddling wherry like disturbed water bug. Jo’s funny hat deserved vote thanks, general utility. It broke ice beginning producing laugh, created quite refreshing breeze, flapping fro rowed, would make excellent umbrella whole party, shower came up, said.

He never talked much, looked good deal, felt sure regard aversion. Ned, college, course put airs freshmen think bounden duty assume. He wise, good-natured, altogether excellent person carry picnic. Sallie Gardiner absorbed keeping white pique dress clean chattering ubiquitous Fred, kept Beth constant terror pranks. It far Longmeadow, tent pitched wickets time arrived. A pleasant green field, three wide-spreading oaks middle smooth strip turf croquet. “Welcome Camp Laurence!” said young host, landed exclamations delight. “Brooke commander chief, I commissary general, fellows staff officers, you, ladies, company.

No one near, running examine, gave sly nudge toe, put inch right side. “I through! Now, Miss Jo, I settle you, get first,” cried young gentleman, swinging mallet another blow. “You pushed it.

So, stand please, let go stake.” “We cheat America, can, choose,” said Jo angrily. “Yankees deal tricky, everybody knows. There go!” returned Fred, croqueting ball far away. Jo opened lips say something rude, checked time, colored forehead stood minute, hammering wicket might, Fred hit stake declared much exultation. She went get ball, long time finding among bushes, came back, looking cool quiet, waited turn patiently. It took several strokes regain place lost, got there, side nearly won, Kate’s ball last one lay near stake. “By George, us! Goodbye, Kate.

The knight I interested went back find pretty face, learned princesses spun free gone married, one. He great state mind that, mounting colt, stood thick thin, rushed castle see left. Peeping hedge, saw queen affections picking flowers garden. ‘Will give rose?’ said he. ‘You must come get it. I cannot come you, proper,’ said she, sweet honey.

I playing, I never do,” said Frank, dismayed sentimental predicament rescue absurd couple. Beth disappeared behind Jo, Grace asleep. “So poor knight left sticking hedge, he?” asked Mr. Brooke, still watching river, playing wild rose buttonhole. “I guess princess gave posy, opened gate while,” said Laurie, smiling himself, threw acorns tutor. “What piece nonsense made! With practice might something quite clever. Do know Truth?” “I hope so,” said Meg soberly. “The game, I mean?” “What it?” said Fred. “Why, pile hands, choose number, draw turn, person draws number answer truly question put rest. It great fun.” “Let us try it,” said Jo, liked new experiments. Miss Kate Mr. Brooke, Meg, Ned declined, Fred, Sallie, Jo, Laurie piled drew, lot fell Laurie. “Who heroes?” asked Jo. “Grandfather Napoleon.” “Which lady think prettiest?” said Sallie. “Margaret.” “Which like best?” Fred. “Jo, course.” “What silly questions ask!” And Jo gave disdainful shrug rest laughed Laurie’s matter-of-fact tone. “Try again. Truth bad game,” said Fred. “It good one you,” retorted Jo low voice. Her turn came next. “What greatest fault?” asked Fred, way testing virtue lacked himself. “A quick temper.” “What wish for?” said Laurie. “A pair boot lacings,” returned Jo, guessing defeating purpose. “Not true answer. You must say really want most.” “Genius. Do wish could give me, Laurie?” And slyly smiled disappointed face. “What virtues admire man?” asked Sallie. “Courage honesty.” “Now turn,” said Fred, hand came last. “Let us give him,” whispered Laurie Jo, nodded asked once... “Did cheat croquet?” “Well, yes, little bit.” “Good! Did take story _The Sea Lion?_” said Laurie. “Rather.” “Do think English nation perfect every respect?” asked Sallie. “I ashamed I not.” “He true John Bull. Now, Miss Sallie, shall chance without waiting draw. I harrrow feelings first asking think something flirt,” said Laurie, Jo nodded Fred sign peace declared. “You impertinent boy! Of course I not,” exclaimed Sallie, air proved contrary. “What hate most?” asked Fred. “Spiders rice pudding.” “What like best?” asked Jo. “Dancing French gloves.” “Well, I think Truth silly play. Let us sensible game Authors refresh minds,” proposed Jo. Ned, Frank, little girls joined this, went on, three elders sat apart, talking. Miss Kate took sketch again, Margaret watched her, Mr. Brooke lay grass book, read. “How beautifully it! I wish I could draw,” said Meg, mingled admiration regret voice. “Why learn? I think taste talent it,” replied Miss Kate graciously. “I time.” “Your mamma prefers accomplishments, I fancy. So mine, I proved I talent taking lessons privately, quite willing I go on. Cannot governess?” “I none.” “I forgot young ladies America go school us. Very fine schools are, too, Papa says. You go private one, I suppose?” “I go all. I governess myself.” “Oh, indeed!” said Miss Kate, might well said, “Dear me, dreadful!” tone implied it, something face made Meg color, wish frank. Mr. Brooke looked said quickly, “Young ladies America love independence much ancestors did, admired respected supporting themselves.” “Oh, yes, course nice proper so. We many respectable worthy young women employed nobility, because, daughters gentlemen, well bred accomplished, know,” said Miss Kate patronizing tone hurt Meg’s pride, made work seem distasteful, degrading. “Did German song suit, Miss March?” inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking awkward pause. “Oh, yes! It sweet, I much obliged whoever translated me.” And Meg’s downcast face brightened spoke. “Do read German?” asked Miss Kate look surprise. “Not well. My father, taught me, away, I get fast alone, I one correct pronunciation.” “Try little now. Here Schiller’s Mary Stuart tutor loves teach.” And Mr. Brooke laid book lap inviting smile. “It hard I afraid try,” said Meg, grateful, bashful presence accomplished young lady beside her. “I read bit encourage you.” And Miss Kate read one beautiful passages perfectly correct perfectly expressionless manner. Mr. Brooke made comment returned book Meg, said innocently, “I thought poetry.” “Some is. Try passage.” There queer smile Mr. Brooke’s mouth opened poor Mary’s lament. Meg obediently following long grass-blade new tutor used point with, read slowly timidly, unconsciously making poetry hard words soft intonation musical voice. Down page went green guide, presently, forgetting listener beauty sad scene, Meg read alone, giving little touch tragedy words unhappy queen. If seen brown eyes then, would stopped short, never looked up, lesson spoiled her. “Very well indeed!” said Mr. Brooke, paused, quite ignoring many mistakes, looking indeed love teach. Miss Kate put glass, and, taken survey little tableau her, shut sketch book, saying condescension, “You nice accent time clever reader. I advise learn, German valuable accomplishment teachers. I must look Grace, romping.” And Miss Kate strolled away, adding shrug, “I come chaperone governess, though young pretty. What odd people Yankees are. I afraid Laurie quite spoiled among them.” “I forgot English people rather turn noses governesses treat do,” said Meg, looking retreating figure annoyed expression. “Tutors also rather hard time there, I know sorrow. There place like America us workers, Miss Margaret.” And Mr. Brooke looked contented cheerful Meg ashamed lament hard lot. “I glad I live then. I like work, I get good deal satisfaction all, I complain. I wished I liked teaching do.” “I think would Laurie pupil. I shall sorry lose next year,” said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes turf. “Going college, I suppose?” Meg’s lips asked question, eyes added, “And becomes you?” “Yes, high time went, ready, soon off, I shall turn soldier. I needed.” “I glad that!” exclaimed Meg. “I think every young man would want go, though hard mothers sisters stay home,” added sorrowfully. “I neither, friends care whether I live die,” said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly absently put dead rose hole made covered up, like little grave. “Laurie grandfather would care great deal, sorry harm happen you,” said Meg heartily. “Thank you, sounds pleasant,” began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful again, could finish speech, Ned, mounted old horse, came lumbering display equestrian skill young ladies, quiet day. “Do love ride?” asked Grace Amy, stood resting race round field others, led Ned. “I dote upon it. My sister, Meg, used ride Papa rich, keep horses now, except Ellen Tree,” added Amy, laughing. “Tell Ellen Tree. Is donkey?” asked Grace curiously. “Why, see, Jo crazy horses I, got old sidesaddle horse. Out garden apple tree nice low branch, Jo put saddle it, fixed reins part turns up, bounce away Ellen Tree whenever like.” “How funny!” laughed Grace. “I pony home, ride nearly every day park Fred Kate. It nice, friends go too, Row full ladies gentlemen.” “Dear, charming! I hope I shall go abroad day, I would rather go Rome Row,” said Amy, remotest idea Row would asked world. Frank, sitting behind little girls, heard saying, pushed crutch away impatient gesture watched active lads going sorts comical gymnastics. Beth, collecting scattered Author cards, looked said, shy yet friendly way, “I afraid tired. Can I anything you?” “Talk me, please. It dull, sitting myself,” answered Frank, evidently used made much home. If asked deliver Latin oration, would seemed impossible task bashful Beth, place run to, Jo hide behind now, poor boy looked wistfully bravely resolved try. “What like talk about?” asked, fumbling cards dropping half tried tie up. “Well, I like hear cricket boating hunting,” said Frank, yet learned suit amusements strength. My heart! What shall I do? I know anything them, thought Beth, forgetting boy’s misfortune flurry, said, hoping make talk, “I never saw hunting, I suppose know it.” “I once, I never hunt again, I got hurt leaping confounded five-barred gate, horses hounds me,” said Frank sigh made Beth hate innocent blunder. “Your deer much prettier ugly buffaloes,” said, turning prairies help feeling glad read one boys’ books Jo delighted. Buffaloes proved soothing satisfactory, eagerness amuse another, Beth forgot herself, quite unconscious sisters’ surprise delight unusual spectacle Beth talking away one dreadful boys, begged protection. “Bless heart! She pities him, good him,” said Jo, beaming croquet ground. “I always said little saint,” added Meg, could doubt it. “I heard Frank laugh much ever long,” said Grace Amy, sat discussing dolls making tea sets acorn cups. “My sister Beth fastidious girl, likes be,” said Amy, well pleased Beth’s success. She meant ‘facinating’, Grace know exact meaning either word, fastidious sounded well made good impression. An impromptu circus, fox geese, amicable game croquet finished afternoon. At sunset tent struck, hampers packed, wickets pulled up, boats loaded, whole party floated river, singing tops voices. Ned, getting sentimental, warbled serenade pensive refrain... Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone, lines... We young, heart, Oh, stand thus coldly apart? looked Meg lackadaisical expression laughed outright spoiled song. “How cruel me?” whispered, cover lively chorus. “You kept close starched-up Englishwoman day, snub me.” “I mean to, looked funny I really could help it,” replied Meg, passing first part reproach, quite true shunned him, remembering Moffat party talk it. Ned offended turned Sallie consolation, saying rather pettishly, “There bit flirt girl, there?” “Not particle, dear,” returned Sallie, defending friend even confessing shortcomings. “She stricken deer anyway,” said Ned, trying witty, succeeding well young gentlemen usually do. On lawn gathered, little party separated cordial good nights good-byes, Vaughns going Canada. As four sisters went home garden, Miss Kate looked them, saying, without patronizing tone voice, “In spite demonstrative manners, American girls nice one knows them.” “I quite agree you,” said Mr. Brooke. CHAPTER THIRTEEN CASTLES IN THE AIR Laurie lay luxuriously swinging fro hammock one warm September afternoon, wondering neighbors about, lazy go find out. He one moods, day unprofitable unsatisfactory, wishing could live again. The hot weather made indolent, shirked studies, tried Mr. Brooke’s patience utmost, displeased grandfather practicing half afternoon, frightened maidservants half wits mischievously hinting one dogs going mad, and, high words stableman fancied neglect horse, flung hammock fume stupidity world general, till peace lovely day quieted spite himself. Staring green gloom horse-chestnut trees him, dreamed dreams sorts, imagining tossing ocean voyage round world, sound voices brought ashore flash. Peeping meshes hammock, saw Marches coming out, bound expedition. “What world girls now?” thought Laurie, opening sleepy eyes take good look, something rather peculiar appearance neighbors. Each wore large, flapping hat, brown linen pouch slung one shoulder, carried long staff. Meg cushion, Jo book, Beth basket, Amy portfolio. All walked quietly garden, little back gate, began climb hill lay house river. “Well, cool,” said Laurie himself, “to picnic never ask me! They cannot going boat, got key. Perhaps forgot it. I take them, see going on.” Though possessed half dozen hats, took time find one, hunt key, last discovered pocket, girls quite sight leaped fence ran them. Taking shortest way boathouse, waited appear, one came, went hill take observation. A grove pines covered one part it, heart green spot came clearer sound soft sigh pines drowsy chirp crickets. “Here landscape!” thought Laurie, peeping bushes, looking wide-awake good-natured already. It rather pretty little picture, sisters sat together shady nook, sun shadow flickering them, aromatic wind lifting hair cooling hot cheeks, little wood people going affairs strangers old friends. Meg sat upon cushion, sewing daintily white hands, looking fresh sweet rose pink dress among green. Beth sorting cones lay thick hemlock near by, made pretty things them. Amy sketching group ferns, Jo knitting read aloud. A shadow passed boy’s face watched them, feeling ought go away uninvited; yet lingering home seemed lonely quiet party woods attractive restless spirit. He stood still squirrel, busy harvesting, ran pine close beside him, saw suddenly skipped back, scolding shrilly Beth looked up, espied wistful face behind birches, beckoned reassuring smile. “May I come in, please? Or shall I bother?” asked, advancing slowly. Meg lifted eyebrows, Jo scowled defiantly said once, “Of course may. We asked before, thought would care girl’s game this.” “I always like games, Meg want me, I go away.” “I objection, something. It rules idle here,” replied Meg gravely graciously. “Much obliged. I anything let stop bit, dull Desert Sahara there. Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, once? Bring bears. I ready.” And Laurie sat submissive expression delightful behold. “Finish story I set heel,” said Jo, handing book. “Yes’m.” meek answer, began, best prove gratitude favor admission ‘Busy Bee Society’. The story long one, finished, ventured ask questions reward merit. “Please, madam, could I inquire highly instructive charming institution new one?” “Would tell him?” asked Meg sisters. “He laugh,” said Amy warningly. “Who cares?” said Jo. “I guess like it,” added Beth. “Of course I shall! I give word I laugh. Tell away, Jo, afraid.” “The idea afraid you! Well, see used play Pilgrim’s Progress, going earnest, winter summer.” “Yes, I know,” said Laurie, nodding wisely. “Who told you?” demanded Jo. “Spirits.” “No, I did. I wanted amuse one night away, rather dismal. He like it, scold, Jo,” said Beth meekly. “You cannot keep secret. Never mind, saves trouble now.” “Go on, please,” said Laurie, Jo became absorbed work, looking trifle displeased. “Oh, tell new plan ours? Well, tried waste holiday, task worked will. The vacation nearly over, stints done, ever glad dawdle.” “Yes, I think so,” Laurie thought regretfully idle days. “Mother likes us out-of-doors much possible, bring work nice times. For fun bring things bags, wear old hats, use poles climb hill, play pilgrims, used years ago. We call hill Delectable Mountain, look far away see country hope live time.” Jo pointed, Laurie sat examine, opening wood one could look cross wide, blue river, meadows side, far outskirts great city, green hills rose meet sky. The sun low, heavens glowed splendor autumn sunset. Gold purple clouds lay hilltops, rising high ruddy light silvery white peaks shone like airy spires Celestial City. “How beautiful is!” said Laurie softly, quick see feel beauty kind. “It often so, like watch it, never same, always splendid,” replied Amy, wishing could paint it. “Jo talks country hope live sometime—the real country, means, pigs chickens haymaking. It would nice, I wish beautiful country real, could ever go it,” said Beth musingly. “There lovelier country even that, shall go, by-and-by, good enough,” answered Meg sweetest voice. “It seems long wait, hard do. I want fly away once, swallows fly, go splendid gate.” “You get there, Beth, sooner later, fear that,” said Jo. “I one fight work, climb wait, maybe never get all.” “You company, comfort. I shall deal traveling I come sight Celestial City. If I arrive late, say good word me, you, Beth?” Something boy’s face troubled little friend, said cheerfully, quiet eyes changing clouds, “If people really want go, really try lives, I think get in, I believe locks door guards gate. I always imagine picture, shining ones stretch hands welcome poor Christian comes river.” “Would fun castles air make could come true, could live them?” said Jo, little pause. “I made quantities would hard choose I would have,” said Laurie, lying flat throwing cones squirrel betrayed him. “You would take favorite one. What it?” asked Meg. “If I tell mine, tell yours?” “Yes, girls too.” “We will. Now, Laurie.” “After I would seen much world I want to, I would like settle Germany much music I choose. I famous musician myself, creation rush hear me. And I never bothered money business, enjoy live I like. That favorite castle. What yours, Meg?” Margaret seemed find little hard tell hers, waved brake face, disperse imaginary gnats, said slowly, “I like lovely house, full sorts luxurious things—nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, pleasant people, heaps money. I mistress it, manage I like, plenty servants, I never need work bit. How I enjoy it! For I would idle, good, make everyone love dearly.” “Would master castle air?” asked Laurie slyly. “I said ‘pleasant people’, know,” Meg carefully tied shoe spoke, one saw face. “Why say would splendid, wise, good husband angelic little children? You know castle would perfect without,” said blunt Jo, tender fancies yet, rather scorned romance, except books. “You would nothing horses, inkstands, novels yours,” answered Meg petulantly. “Would I though? I would stable full Arabian steeds, rooms piled high books, I would write magic inkstand, works famous Laurie’s music. I want something splendid I go castle, something heroic wonderful forgotten I dead. I know what, I watch it, mean astonish day. I think I shall write books, get rich famous, would suit me, favorite dream.” “Mine stay home safe Father Mother, help take care family,” said Beth contentedly. “Do wish anything else?” asked Laurie. “Since I little piano, I perfectly satisfied. I wish may keep well together, nothing else.” “I ever many wishes, pet one artist, go Rome, fine pictures, best artist whole world,” Amy’s modest desire. “We ambitious set, we? Every one us, Beth, wants rich famous, gorgeous every respect. I wonder us ever get wishes,” said Laurie, chewing grass like meditative calf. “I got key castle air, whether I unlock door remains seen,” observed Jo mysteriously. “I got key mine, I allowed try it. Hang college!” muttered Laurie impatient sigh. “Here mine!” Amy waved pencil. “I got any,” said Meg forlornly. “Yes, have,” said Laurie once. “Where?” “In face.” “Nonsense, use.” “Wait see bring something worth having,” replied boy, laughing thought charming little secret fancied knew. Meg colored behind brake, asked questions looked across river expectant expression Mr. Brooke worn told story knight. “If alive ten years hence, let us meet, see many us got wishes, much nearer now,” said Jo, always ready plan. “Bless me! How old I shall be, twenty-seven!” exclaimed Meg, felt grown already, reached seventeen. “You I twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, Amy twenty-two. What venerable party!” said Jo. “I hope I shall done something proud time, I lazy dog, I afraid I shall dawdle, Jo.” “You need motive, Mother says, get it, sure work splendidly.” “Is she? By Jupiter, I will, I get chance!” cried Laurie, sitting sudden energy. “I ought satisfied please Grandfather, I try, working grain, see, comes hard. He wants India merchant, was, I would rather shot. I hate tea silk spices, every sort rubbish old ships bring, I care soon go bottom I them. Going college ought satisfy him, I give four years ought let business. But set, I got did, unless I break away please myself, father did. If anyone left stay old gentleman, I would tomorrow.” Laurie spoke excitedly, looked ready carry threat execution slightest provocation, growing fast and, spite indolent ways, young man’s hatred subjection, young man’s restless longing try world himself. “I advise sail away one ships, never come home till tried way,” said Jo, whose imagination fired thought daring exploit, whose sympathy excited called ‘Teddy’s Wrongs’. “That right, Jo. You must talk way, Laurie must take bad advice. You grandfather wishes, dear boy,” said Meg maternal tone. “Do best college, sees try please him, I sure hard unjust you. As say, one else stay love him, would never forgive left without permission. Do dismal fret, duty get reward, good Mr. Brooke has, respected loved.” “What know him?” asked Laurie, grateful good advice, objecting lecture, glad turn conversation unusual outbreak. “Only grandpa told us him, took good care mother till died, would go abroad tutor nice person would leave her. And provides old woman nursed mother, never tells anyone, generous patient good be.” “So is, dear old fellow!” said Laurie heartily, Meg paused, looking flushed earnest story. “It like Grandpa find without letting know, tell goodness others, might like him. Brooke could understand mother kind him, asking treating beautiful friendly way. He thought perfect, talked days days, went flaming style. If ever I get wish, see I Brooke.” “Begin something plaguing life out,” said Meg sharply. “How know I do, Miss?” “I always tell face goes away. If good, looks satisfied walks briskly. If plagued him, sober walks slowly, wanted go back work better.” “Well, I like that? So keep account good bad marks Brooke’s face, you? I see bow smile passes window, I know would got telegraph.” “We not. Do angry, oh, tell I said anything! It show I cared get on, said said confidence, know,” cried Meg, much alarmed thought might follow careless speech. “I tell tales,” replied Laurie, ‘high mighty’ air, Jo called certain expression occasionally wore. “Only Brooke going thermometer, I must mind fair weather report.” “Please offended. I mean preach tell tales silly. I thought Jo encouraging feeling would sorry by-and-by. You kind us, feel brother say think. Forgive me, I meant kindly.” And Meg offered hand gesture affectionate timid. Ashamed momentary pique, Laurie squeezed kind little hand, said frankly, “I one forgiven. I cross sorts day. I like tell faults sisterly, mind I grumpy sometimes. I thank same.” Bent showing offended, made agreeable possible, wound cotton Meg, recited poetry please Jo, shook cones Beth, helped Amy ferns, proving fit person belong ‘Busy Bee Society’. In midst animated discussion domestic habits turtles (one amiable creatures strolled river), faint sound bell warned Hannah put tea ‘to draw’, would time get home supper. “May I come again?” asked Laurie. “Yes, good, love book, boys primer told do,” said Meg, smiling. “I try.” “Then may come, I teach knit Scotchmen do. There demand socks now,” added Jo, waving like big blue worsted banner parted gate. That night, Beth played Mr. Laurence twilight, Laurie, standing shadow curtain, listened little David, whose simple music always quieted moody spirit, watched old man, sat gray head hand, thinking tender thoughts dead child loved much. Remembering conversation afternoon, boy said himself, resolve make sacrifice cheerfully, “I let castle go, stay dear old gentleman needs me, I has.” CHAPTER FOURTEEN SECRETS Jo busy garret, October days began grow chilly, afternoons short. For two three hours sun lay warmly high window, showing Jo seated old sofa, writing busily, papers spread upon trunk her, Scrabble, pet rat, promenaded beams overhead, accompanied oldest son, fine young fellow, evidently proud whiskers. Quite absorbed work, Jo scribbled away till last page filled, signed name flourish threw pen, exclaiming... “There, I done best! If suit I shall wait till I better.” Lying back sofa, read manuscript carefully through, making dashes there, putting many exclamation points, looked like little balloons. Then tied smart red ribbon, sat minute looking sober, wistful expression, plainly showed earnest work been. Jo’s desk old tin kitchen hung wall. In kept papers, books, safely shut away Scrabble, who, likewise literary turn, fond making circulating library books left way eating leaves. From tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, putting pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving friends nibble pens taste ink. She put hat jacket noiselessly possible, going back entry window, got upon roof low porch, swung grassy bank, took roundabout way road. Once there, composed herself, hailed passing omnibus, rolled away town, looking merry mysterious. If anyone watching her, would thought movements decidedly peculiar, alighting, went great pace till reached certain number certain busy street. Having found place difficulty, went doorway, looked dirty stairs, standing stock still minute, suddenly dived street walked away rapidly came. This maneuver repeated several times, great amusement black-eyed young gentleman lounging window building opposite. On returning third time, Jo gave shake, pulled hat eyes, walked stairs, looking going teeth out. There dentist’s sign, among others, adorned entrance, staring moment pair artificial jaws slowly opened shut draw attention fine set teeth, young gentleman put coat, took hat, went post opposite doorway, saying smile shiver, “It like come alone, bad time need someone help home.” In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs red face general appearance person passed trying ordeal sort. When saw young gentleman looked anything pleased, passed nod. But followed, asking air sympathy, “Did bad time?” “Not very.” “You got quickly.” “Yes, thank goodness!” “Why go alone?” “Did want anyone know.” “You oddest fellow I ever saw. How many out?” Jo looked friend understand him, began laugh mightily amused something. “There two I want come out, I must wait week.” “What laughing at? You mischief, Jo,” said Laurie, looking mystified. “So you. What doing, sir, billiard saloon?” “Begging pardon, madam, billiard saloon, gymnasium, I taking lesson fencing.” “I glad that.” “Why?” “You teach me, play _Hamlet_, Laertes, make fine thing fencing scene.” Laurie burst hearty boy’s laugh, made several passers-by smile spite themselves. “I teach whether play _Hamlet_ not. It grand fun straighten capitally. But I believe reason saying ‘I glad’ decided way, now?” “No, I glad saloon, I hope never go places. Do you?” “Not often.” “I wish would not.” “It harm, Jo. I billiards home, fun unless good players, so, I fond it, I come sometimes game Ned Moffat fellows.” “Oh, dear, I sorry, get liking better better, waste time money, grow like dreadful boys. I hope would stay respectable satisfaction friends,” said Jo, shaking head. “Cannot fellow take little innocent amusement without losing respectability?” asked Laurie, looking nettled. “That depends upon takes it. I like Ned set, wish would keep it. Mother let us house, though wants come. And grow like willing us frolic together now.” “Will she?” asked Laurie anxiously. “No, cannot bear fashionable young men, would shut us bandboxes rather us associate them.” “Well, need get bandboxes yet. I fashionable party mean be, I like harmless larks then, you?” “Yes, nobody minds them, lark away, get wild, you? Or end good times.” “I double distilled saint.” “I cannot bear saints. Just simple, honest, respectable boy, never desert you. I know I acted like Mr. King’s son. He plenty money, know spend it, got tipsy gambled, ran away, forged father’s name, I believe, altogether horrid.” “You think I likely same? Much obliged.” “No, I not—oh, dear, no!—but I hear people talking money temptation, I sometimes wish poor. I worry then.” “Do worry me, Jo?” “A little, look moody discontented, sometimes do, got strong will, get started wrong, I afraid would hard stop you.” Laurie walked silence minutes, Jo watched him, wishing held tongue, eyes looked angry, though lips smiled warnings. “Are going deliver lectures way home?” asked presently. “Of course not. Why?” “Because are, I take bus. If not, I would like walk tell something interesting.” “I preach more, I would like hear news immensely.” “Very well, then, come on. It secret, I tell you, must tell yours.” “I got any,” began Jo, stopped suddenly, remembering had. “You know have—you cannot hide anything, ’fess, I tell,” cried Laurie. “Is secret nice one?” “Oh, it! All people know, fun! You ought hear it, I aching tell long time. Come, begin.” “You say anything home, you?” “Not word.” “And tease private?” “I never tease.” “Yes, do. You get everything want people. I know it, born wheedler.” “Thank you. Fire away.” “Well, I left two stories newspaperman, give answer next week,” whispered Jo, confidant’s ear. “Hurrah Miss March, celebrated American authoress!” cried Laurie, throwing hat catching again, great delight two ducks, four cats, five hens, half dozen Irish children, city now. “Hush! It come anything, I dare say, I could rest till I tried, I said nothing I want anyone else disappointed.” “It fail. Why, Jo, stories works Shakespeare compared half rubbish published every day. Will fun see print, shall feel proud authoress?” Jo’s eyes sparkled, always pleasant believed in, friend’s praise always sweeter dozen newspaper puffs. “Where secret? Play fair, Teddy, I never believe again,” said, trying extinguish brilliant hopes blazed word encouragement. “I may get scrape telling, I promise to, I will, I never feel easy mind till I told plummy bit news I get. I know Meg’s glove is.” “Is all?” said Jo, looking disappointed, Laurie nodded twinkled face full mysterious intelligence. “It quite enough present, agree I tell is.” “Tell, then.” Laurie bent, whispered three words Jo’s ear, produced comical change. She stood stared minute, looking surprised displeased, walked on, saying sharply, “How know?” “Saw it.” “Where?” “Pocket.” “All time?” “Yes, romantic?” “No, horrid.” “Do like it?” “Of course I not. It ridiculous, allowed. My patience! What would Meg say?” “You tell anyone. Mind that.” “I promise.” “That understood, I trusted you.” “Well, I present, anyway, I disgusted, wish told me.” “I thought would pleased.” “At idea anybody coming take Meg away? No, thank you.” “You feel better somebody comes take away.” “I would like see anyone try it,” cried Jo fiercely. “So I!” Laurie chuckled idea. “I think secrets agree me, I feel rumpled mind since told that,” said Jo rather ungratefully. “Race hill me, right,” suggested Laurie. No one sight, smooth road sloped invitingly her, finding temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat comb behind scattering hairpins ran. Laurie reached goal first quite satisfied success treatment, Atlanta came panting flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, signs dissatisfaction face. “I wish I horse, I could run miles splendid air, lose breath. It capital, see guy made me. Go, pick things, like cherub, are,” said Jo, dropping maple tree, carpeting bank crimson leaves. Laurie leisurely departed recover lost property, Jo bundled braids, hoping one would pass till tidy again. But someone pass, Meg, looking particularly ladylike state festival suit, making calls. “What world here?” asked, regarding disheveled sister well-bred surprise. “Getting leaves,” meekly answered Jo, sorting rosy handful swept up. “And hairpins,” added Laurie, throwing half dozen Jo’s lap. “They grow road, Meg, combs brown straw hats.” “You running, Jo. How could you? When stop romping ways?” said Meg reprovingly, settled cuffs smoothed hair, wind taken liberties. “Never till I stiff old use crutch. Do try make grow time, Meg. It hard enough change sudden. Let little girl long I can.” As spoke, Jo bent leaves hide trembling lips, lately felt Margaret fast getting woman, Laurie’s secret made dread separation must surely come time seemed near. He saw trouble face drew Meg’s attention asking quickly, “Where calling, fine?” “At Gardiners’, Sallie telling Belle Moffat’s wedding. It splendid, gone spend winter Paris. Just think delightful must be!” “Do envy her, Meg?” said Laurie. “I afraid I do.” “I glad it!” muttered Jo, tying hat jerk. “Why?” asked Meg, looking surprised. “Because care much riches, never go marry poor man,” said Jo, frowning Laurie, mutely warning mind said. “I shall never ‘_go_ marry’ anyone,” observed Meg, walking great dignity others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping stones, ‘behaving like children’, Meg said herself, though might tempted join best dress on. For week two, Jo behaved queerly sisters quite bewildered. She rushed door postman rang, rude Mr. Brooke whenever met, would sit looking Meg woe-begone face, occasionally jumping shake kiss mysterious manner. Laurie always making signs one another, talking ‘Spread Eagles’ till girls declared lost wits. On second Saturday Jo got window, Meg, sat sewing window, scandalized sight Laurie chasing Jo garden finally capturing Amy’s bower. What went there, Meg could see, shrieks laughter heard, followed murmur voices great flapping newspapers. “What shall girl? She never _will_ behave like young lady,” sighed Meg, watched race disapproving face. “I hope not. She funny dear is,” said Beth, never betrayed little hurt Jo’s secrets anyone her. “It trying, never make _commy la fo_,” added Amy, sat making new frills herself, curls tied becoming way, two agreeable things made feel unusually elegant ladylike. In minutes Jo bounced in, laid sofa, affected read. “Have anything interesting there?” asked Meg, condescension. “Nothing story, amount much, I guess,” returned Jo, carefully keeping name paper sight. “You would better read aloud. That amuse us keep mischief,” said Amy grown-up tone. “What name?” asked Beth, wondering Jo kept face behind sheet. “The Rival Painters.” “That sounds well. Read it,” said Meg. With loud “Hem!” long breath, Jo began read fast. The girls listened interest, tale romantic, somewhat pathetic, characters died end. “I like splendid picture,” Amy’s approving remark, Jo paused. “I prefer lovering part. Viola Angelo two favorite names, queer?” said Meg, wiping eyes, lovering part tragical. “Who wrote it?” asked Beth, caught glimpse Jo’s face. The reader suddenly sat up, cast away paper, displaying flushed countenance, funny mixture solemnity excitement replied loud voice, “Your sister.” “You?” cried Meg, dropping work. “It good,” said Amy critically. “I knew it! I knew it! Oh, Jo, I proud!” Beth ran hug sister exult splendid success. Dear me, delighted were, sure! How Meg would believe till saw words. “Miss Josephine March,” actually printed paper. How graciously Amy criticized artistic parts story, offered hints sequel, unfortunately could carried out, hero heroine dead. How Beth got excited, skipped sang joy. How Hannah came exclaim, “Sakes alive, well I never!” great astonishment ‘that Jo’s doin’s’. How proud Mrs. March knew it. How Jo laughed, tears eyes, declared might well peacock done it, ‘Spread Eagle’ might said flap wings triumphantly House March, paper passed hand hand. “Tell us it.” “When come?” “How much get it?” “What Father say?” “Will Laurie laugh?” cried family, one breath clustered Jo, foolish, affectionate people made jubilee every little household joy. “Stop jabbering, girls, I tell everything,” said Jo, wondering Miss Burney felt grander Evelina ‘Rival Painters’. Having told disposed tales, Jo added, “And I went get answer, man said liked both, pay beginners, let print paper, noticed stories. It good practice, said, beginners improved, anyone would pay. So I let two stories, today sent me, Laurie caught insisted seeing it, I let him. And said good, I shall write more, going get next paid for, I happy, time I may able support help girls.” Jo’s breath gave here, wrapping head paper, bedewed little story natural tears, independent earn praise loved dearest wishes heart, seemed first step toward happy end. CHAPTER FIFTEEN A TELEGRAM “November disagreeable month whole year,” said Margaret, standing window one dull afternoon, looking frostbitten garden. “That reason I born it,” observed Jo pensively, quite unconscious blot nose. “If something pleasant happen now, think delightful month,” said Beth, took hopeful view everything, even November. “I dare say, nothing pleasant ever happen family,” said Meg, sorts. “We go grubbing along day day, without bit change, little fun. We might well treadmill.” “My patience, blue are!” cried Jo. “I much wonder, poor dear, see girls splendid times, grind, grind, year year out. Oh, I wish I could manage things I heroines! You pretty enough good enough already, I would rich relation leave fortune unexpectedly. Then would dash heiress, scorn everyone slighted you, go abroad, come home Lady Something blaze splendor elegance.” “People fortunes left style nowadays, men work women marry money. It dreadfully unjust world,” said Meg bitterly. “Jo I going make fortunes all. Just wait ten years, see not,” said Amy, sat corner making mud pies, Hannah called little clay models birds, fruit, faces. “Cannot wait, I afraid I much faith ink dirt, though I grateful good intentions.” Meg sighed, turned frostbitten garden again. Jo groaned leaned elbows table despondent attitude, Amy spatted away energetically, Beth, sat window, said, smiling, “Two pleasant things going happen right away. Marmee coming street, Laurie tramping garden something nice tell.” In came, Mrs. March usual question, “Any letter Father, girls?” Laurie say persuasive way, “Will come drive? I working away mathematics till head muddle, I going freshen wits brisk turn. It dull day, air bad, I going take Brooke home, gay inside, out. Come, Jo, Beth go, you?” “Of course will.” “Much obliged, I busy.” And Meg whisked workbasket, agreed mother best, least, drive often young gentleman. “We three ready minute,” cried Amy, running away wash hands. “Can I anything you, Madam Mother?” asked Laurie, leaning Mrs. March’s chair affectionate look tone always gave her. “No, thank you, except call office, kind, dear. It day letter, postman been. Father regular sun, delay way, perhaps.” A sharp ring interrupted her, minute Hannah came letter. “It one horrid telegraph things, mum,” said, handling afraid would explode damage. At word ‘telegraph’, Mrs. March snatched it, read two lines contained, dropped back chair white little paper sent bullet heart. Laurie dashed downstairs water, Meg Hannah supported her, Jo read aloud, frightened voice... Mrs. March: Your husband ill. Come once. S. HALE Blank Hospital, Washington. How still room listened breathlessly, strangely day darkened outside, suddenly whole world seemed change, girls gathered mother, feeling happiness support lives taken them. Mrs. March directly, read message over, stretched arms daughters, saying, tone never forgot, “I shall go once, may late. Oh, children, children, help bear it!” For several minutes nothing sound sobbing room, mingled broken words comfort, tender assurances help, hopeful whispers died away tears. Poor Hannah first recover, unconscious wisdom set rest good example, her, work panacea afflictions. “The Lord keep dear man! I waste time a-cryin’, git things ready right away, mum,” said heartily, wiped face apron, gave mistress warm shake hand hard one, went away work like three women one. “She right, time tears now. Be calm, girls, let think.” They tried calm, poor things, mother sat up, looking pale steady, put away grief think plan them. “Where Laurie?” asked presently, collected thoughts decided first duties done. “Here, madam. Oh, let something!” cried boy, hurrying next room whither withdrawn, feeling first sorrow sacred even friendly eyes see. “Send telegram saying I come once. The next train goes early morning. I take that.” “What else? The horses ready. I go anywhere, anything,” said, looking ready fly ends earth. “Leave note Aunt March’s. Jo, give pen paper.” Tearing blank side one newly copied pages, Jo drew table mother, well knowing money long, sad journey must borrowed, feeling could anything add little sum father. “Now go, dear, kill driving desperate pace. There need that.” Mrs. March’s warning evidently thrown away, five minutes later Laurie tore window fleet horse, riding life. “Jo, run rooms, tell Mrs. King I cannot come. On way get things. I put down, needed I must go prepared nursing. Hospital stores always good. Beth, go ask Mr. Laurence couple bottles old wine. I proud beg Father. He shall best everything. Amy, tell Hannah get black trunk, Meg, come help find things, I half bewildered.” Writing, thinking, directing might well bewilder poor lady, Meg begged sit quietly room little while, let work. Everyone scattered like leaves gust wind, quiet, happy household broken suddenly paper evil spell. Mr. Laurence came hurrying back Beth, bringing every comfort kind old gentleman could think invalid, friendliest promises protection girls mother’s absence, comforted much. There nothing offer, dressing gown escort. But last impossible. Mrs. March would hear old gentleman’s undertaking long journey, yet expression relief visible spoke it, anxiety ill fits one traveling. He saw look, knit heavy eyebrows, rubbed hands, marched abruptly away, saying would back directly. No one time think till, Meg ran entry, pair rubbers one hand cup tea other, came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke. “I sorry hear this, Miss March,” said, kind, quiet tone sounded pleasantly perturbed spirit. “I came offer escort mother. Mr. Laurence commissions Washington, give real satisfaction service there.” Down dropped rubbers, tea near following, Meg put hand, face full gratitude Mr. Brooke would felt repaid much greater sacrifice trifling one time comfort take. “How kind are! Mother accept, I sure, relief know someone take care her. Thank very, much!” Meg spoke earnestly, forgot entirely till something brown eyes looking made remember cooling tea, lead way parlor, saying would call mother. Everything arranged time Laurie returned note Aunt March, enclosing desired sum, lines repeating often said before, always told absurd March go army, always predicted good would come it, hoped would take advice next time. Mrs. March put note fire, money purse, went preparations, lips folded tightly way Jo would understood there. The short afternoon wore away. All errands done, Meg mother busy necessary needlework, Beth Amy got tea, Hannah finished ironing called ‘slap bang’, still Jo come. They began get anxious, Laurie went find her, one knew freak Jo might take head. He missed her, however, came walking queer expression countenance, mixture fun fear, satisfaction regret it, puzzled family much roll bills laid mother, saying little choke voice, “That contribution toward making Father comfortable bringing home!” “My dear, get it? Twenty-five dollars! Jo, I hope done anything rash?” “No, mine honestly. I beg, borrow, steal it. I earned it, I think blame me, I sold own.” As spoke, Jo took bonnet, general outcry arose, abundant hair cut short. “Your hair! Your beautiful hair!” “Oh, Jo, could you? Your one beauty.” “My dear girl, need this.” “She look like Jo more, I love dearly it!” As everyone exclaimed, Beth hugged cropped head tenderly, Jo assumed indifferent air, deceive anyone particle, said, rumpling brown bush trying look liked it, “It affect fate nation, wail, Beth.

I satisfied, please take money let us supper.” “Tell it, Jo. I quite satisfied, I cannot blame you, I know willingly sacrificed vanity, call it, love. But, dear, necessary, I afraid regret one days,” said Mrs. March. “No, I not!” returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved prank entirely condemned. “What made it?” asked Amy, would soon thought cutting head pretty hair. “Well, I wild something Father,” replied Jo, gathered table, healthy young people eat even midst trouble. “I hate borrow much Mother does, I knew Aunt March would croak, always does, ask ninepence. Meg gave quarterly salary toward rent, I got clothes mine, I felt wicked, bound money, I sold nose face get it.” “You need feel wicked, child! You winter things got simplest hard earnings,” said Mrs. March look warmed Jo’s heart. “I least idea selling hair first, I went along I kept thinking I could do, feeling I would like dive rich stores help myself. In barber’s window I saw tails hair prices marked, one black tail, thick mine, forty dollars. It came sudden I one thing make money of, without stopping think, I walked in, asked bought hair, would give mine.” “I see dared it,” said Beth tone awe. “Oh, little man looked merely lived oil hair. He rather stared first, used girls bounce shop ask buy hair. He said care mine, fashionable color, never paid much first place. The work put made dear, on. It getting late, I afraid done right away I done all, know I start thing, I hate give up. So I begged take it, told I hurry. It silly, I dare say, changed mind, I got rather excited, told story topsy-turvy way, wife heard, said kindly, ‘Take it, Thomas, oblige young lady. I would much Jimmy day I spire hair worth selling.” “Who Jimmy?” asked Amy, liked things explained went along. “Her son, said, army. How friendly things make strangers feel, they? She talked away time man clipped, diverted mind nicely.” “Did feel dreadfully first cut came?” asked Meg, shiver. “I took last look hair man got things, end it. I never snivel trifles like that.

I give you, Marmee, remember past glories by, crop comfortable I think I shall ever mane again.” Mrs. March folded wavy chestnut lock, laid away short gray one desk. She said, “Thank you, deary,” something face made girls change subject, talk cheerfully could Mr. Brooke’s kindness, prospect fine day tomorrow, happy times would Father came home nursed. No one wanted go bed ten clock Mrs. March put last finished job, said, “Come girls.” Beth went piano played father’s favorite hymn. All began bravely, broke one one till Beth left alone, singing heart, music always sweet consoler. “Go bed talk, must early shall need sleep get.

The good soul wide awake minute, took lead once, assuring need worry; every one scarlet fever, rightly treated, nobody died, Jo believed, felt much relieved went call Meg. “Now I tell do,” said Hannah, examined questioned Beth, “we Dr. Bangs, take look you, dear, see start right. Then send Amy Aunt March’s spell, keep harm’s way, one girls stay home amuse Beth day two.” “I shall stay, course, I oldest,” began Meg, looking anxious self-reproachful. “I shall, fault sick. I told Mother I would errands, I not,” said Jo decidedly. “Which have, Beth? There need one,” aid Hannah. “Jo, please.” And Beth leaned head sister contented look, effectually settled point. “I go tell Amy,” said Meg, feeling little hurt, yet rather relieved whole, like nursing, Jo did. Amy rebelled outright, passionately declared rather fever go Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded, commanded, vain. Amy protested would go, Meg left despair ask Hannah done. Before came back, Laurie walked parlor find Amy sobbing, head sofa cushions. She told story, expecting consoled, Laurie put hands pockets walked room, whistling softly, knit brows deep thought. Presently sat beside her, said, wheedlesome tone, “Now sensible little woman, say. No, cry, hear jolly plan I got. You go Aunt March’s, I come take every day, driving walking, capital times. Will better moping here?” “I wish sent I way,” began Amy, injured voice. “Bless heart, child, keep well.

I advise soon can, scarlet fever joke, miss.” “But dull Aunt March’s, cross,” said Amy, looking rather frightened. “It dull popping every day tell Beth is, take gallivanting. The old lady likes me, I sweet possible her, peck us, whatever do.” “Will take trotting wagon Puck?” “On honor gentleman.” “And come every single day?” “See I not!” “And bring back minute Beth well?” “The identical minute.” “And go theater, truly?” “A dozen theaters, may.” “Well—I guess I will,” said Amy slowly. “Good girl! Call Meg, tell give in,” said Laurie, approving pat, annoyed Amy ‘giving in’. Meg Jo came running behold miracle wrought, Amy, feeling precious self-sacrificing, promised go, doctor said Beth going ill. “How little dear?” asked Laurie, Beth especial pet, felt anxious liked show. “She lying Mother’s bed, feels better. The baby’s death troubled her, I dare say got cold. Hannah says thinks so, looks worried, makes fidgety,” answered Meg. “What trying world is!” said Jo, rumpling hair fretful way. “No sooner get one trouble comes another. There seem anything hold Mother’s gone, I sea.” “Well, make porcupine yourself, becoming. Settle wig, Jo, tell I shall telegraph mother, anything?” asked Laurie, never reconciled loss friend’s one beauty. “That troubles me,” said Meg. “I think ought tell Beth really ill, Hannah says must not, Mother cannot leave Father, make anxious. Beth sick long, Hannah knows do, Mother said mind her, I suppose must, seem quite right me.” “Hum, well, I cannot say. Suppose ask Grandfather doctor been.” “We will.

Dr. Bangs came, said Beth symptoms fever, thought would lightly, though looked sober Hummel story. Amy ordered once, provided something ward danger, departed great state, Jo Laurie escort. Aunt March received usual hospitality. “What want now?” asked, looking sharply spectacles, parrot, sitting back chair, called out... “Go away. No boys allowed here.” Laurie retired window, Jo told story. “No I expected, allowed go poking among poor folks. Amy stay make useful sick, I doubt be, looks like now. Do cry, child, worries hear people sniff.” Amy point crying, Laurie slyly pulled parrot’s tail, caused Polly utter astonished croak call out, “Bless boots!” funny way, laughed instead. “What hear mother?” asked old lady gruffly. “Father much better,” replied Jo, trying keep sober. “Oh, he? Well, last long, I fancy. March never stamina,” cheerful reply. “Ha, ha! Never say die, take pinch snuff, goodbye, goodbye!” squalled Polly, dancing perch, clawing old lady’s cap Laurie tweaked rear. “Hold tongue, disrespectful old bird! And, Jo, would better go once. It proper gadding late rattlepated boy like...” “Hold tongue, disrespectful old bird!” cried Polly, tumbling chair bounce, running peck ‘rattlepated’ boy, shaking laughter last speech. “I think I bear it, I try,” thought Amy, left alone Aunt March. “Get along, fright!” screamed Polly, rude speech Amy could restrain sniff. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN DARK DAYS Beth fever, much sicker anyone Hannah doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing illness, Mr. Laurence allowed see her, Hannah everything way, busy Dr. Bangs best, left good deal excellent nurse. Meg stayed home, lest infect Kings, kept house, feeling anxious little guilty wrote letters mention made Beth’s illness. She could think right deceive mother, bidden mind Hannah, Hannah would hear ‘Mrs. March bein’ told, worried sech trifle.’ Jo devoted Beth day night, hard task, Beth patient, bore pain uncomplainingly long could control herself. But came time fever fits began talk hoarse, broken voice, play coverlet beloved little piano, try sing throat swollen music left, time know familiar faces around her, addressed wrong names, called imploringly mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged allowed write truth, even Hannah said ‘would think it, though danger yet’. A letter Washington added trouble, Mr. March relapse, could think coming home long while. How dark days seemed now, sad lonely house, heavy hearts sisters worked waited, shadow death hovered happy home. Then Margaret, sitting alone tears dropping often work, felt rich things precious luxuries money could buy—in love, protection, peace, health, real blessings life. Then Jo, living darkened room, suffering little sister always eyes pathetic voice sounding ears, learned see beauty sweetness Beth’s nature, feel deep tender place filled hearts, acknowledge worth Beth’s unselfish ambition live others, make home happy exercise simple virtues may possess, love value talent, wealth, beauty. And Amy, exile, longed eagerly home, might work Beth, feeling service would hard irksome, remembering, regretful grief, many neglected tasks willing hands done her. Laurie haunted house like restless ghost, Mr. Laurence locked grand piano, could bear reminded young neighbor used make twilight pleasant him. Everyone missed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, butcher inquired did, poor Mrs. Hummel came beg pardon thoughtlessness get shroud Minna, neighbors sent sorts comforts good wishes, even knew best surprised find many friends shy little Beth made. Meanwhile lay bed old Joanna side, even wanderings forget forlorn protege. She longed cats, would brought, lest get sick, quiet hours full anxiety Jo. She sent loving messages Amy, bade tell mother would write soon, often begged pencil paper try say word, Father might think neglected him. But soon even intervals consciousness ended, lay hour hour, tossing fro, incoherent words lips, sank heavy sleep brought refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice day, Hannah sat night, Meg kept telegram desk ready send minute, Jo never stirred Beth’s side. The first December wintry day indeed them, bitter wind blew, snow fell fast, year seemed getting ready death. When Dr. Bangs came morning, looked long Beth, held hot hand minute, laid gently down, saying, low voice Hannah, “If Mrs. March leave husband would better sent for.” Hannah nodded without speaking, lips twitched nervously, Meg dropped chair strength seemed go limbs sound words, Jo, standing pale face minute, ran parlor, snatched telegram, throwing things, rushed storm. She soon back, noiselessly taking cloak, Laurie came letter, saying Mr. March mending again. Jo read thankfully, heavy weight seem lifted heart, face full misery Laurie asked quickly, “What it? Is Beth worse?” “I sent Mother,” said Jo, tugging rubber boots tragic expression. “Good you, Jo! Did responsibility?” asked Laurie, seated hall chair took rebellious boots, seeing hands shook. “No. The doctor told us to.” “Oh, Jo, bad that?” cried Laurie, startled face. “Yes, is. She know us, even talk flocks green doves, calls vine leaves wall. She look like Beth, nobody help us bear it. Mother father gone, God seems far away I cannot find Him.” As tears streamed fast poor Jo’s cheeks, stretched hand helpless sort way, groping dark, Laurie took his, whispering well could lump throat, “I here. Hold me, Jo, dear!” She could speak, ‘hold on’, warm grasp friendly human hand comforted sore heart, seemed lead nearer Divine arm alone could uphold trouble. Laurie longed say something tender comfortable, fitting words came him, stood silent, gently stroking bent head mother used do. It best thing could done, far soothing eloquent words, Jo felt unspoken sympathy, silence learned sweet solace affection administers sorrow. Soon dried tears relieved her, looked grateful face. “Thank you, Teddy, I better now. I feel forlorn, try bear comes.” “Keep hoping best, help you, Jo. Soon mother here, everything right.” “I glad Father better. Now feel bad leaving him. Oh, me! It seem troubles came heap, I got heaviest part shoulders,” sighed Jo, spreading wet handkerchief knees dry. “Does Meg pull fair?” asked Laurie, looking indignant. “Oh, yes, tries to, cannot love Bethy I do, miss I shall. Beth conscience, I cannot give up. I cannot! I cannot!” Down went Jo’s face wet handkerchief, cried despairingly, kept bravely till never would tear. Laurie drew hand across eyes, could speak till subdued choky feeling throat steadied lips. It might unmanly, could help it, I glad it. Presently, Jo’s sobs quieted, said hopefully, “I think die. She good, love much, I believe God take away yet.” “The good dear people always die,” groaned Jo, stopped crying, friend’s words cheered spite doubts fears. “Poor girl, worn out. It like forlorn. Stop bit. I hearten jiffy.” Laurie went two stairs time, Jo laid wearied head Beth’s little brown hood, one thought moving table left it. It must possessed magic, submissive spirit gentle owner seemed enter Jo, Laurie came running glass wine, took smile, said bravely, “I drink— Health Beth! You good doctor, Teddy, comfortable friend. How I ever pay you?” added, wine refreshed body, kind words done troubled mind. “I send bill, by-and-by, tonight I give something warm cockles heart better quarts wine,” said Laurie, beaming face suppressed satisfaction something. “What it?” cried Jo, forgetting woes minute wonder. “I telegraphed mother yesterday, Brooke answered would come once, tonight, everything right. Are glad I it?” Laurie spoke fast, turned red excited minute, kept plot secret, fear disappointing girls harming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew chair, moment stopped speaking electrified throwing arms round neck, crying out, joyful cry, “Oh, Laurie! Oh, Mother! I glad!” She weep again, laughed hysterically, trembled clung friend little bewildered sudden news. Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved great presence mind. He patted back soothingly, finding recovering, followed bashful kiss two, brought Jo round once. Holding banisters, put gently away, saying breathlessly, “Oh, not! I mean to, dreadful me, dear go spite Hannah I could help flying you. Tell it, give wine again, makes act so.” “I mind,” laughed Laurie, settled tie. “Why, see I got fidgety, Grandpa. We thought Hannah overdoing authority business, mother ought know. She would never forgive us Beth... Well, anything happened, know. So I got grandpa say high time something, I pelted office yesterday, doctor looked sober, Hannah took head I proposed telegram. I never bear ‘lorded over’, settled mind, I it. Your mother come, I know, late train two A.M. I shall go her, got bottle rapture, keep Beth quiet till blessed lady gets here.” “Laurie, angel! How shall I ever thank you?” “Fly again. I rather liked it,” said Laurie, looking mischievous, thing done fortnight. “No, thank you. I proxy, grandpa comes. Do tease, go home rest, half night. Bless you, Teddy, bless you!” Jo backed corner, finished speech, vanished precipitately kitchen, sat upon dresser told assembled cats “happy, oh, happy!” Laurie departed, feeling made rather neat thing it. “That interferingest chap I ever see, I forgive hope Mrs. March coming right away,” said Hannah, air relief, Jo told good news. Meg quiet rapture, brooded letter, Jo set sickroom order, Hannah “knocked couple pies case company unexpected”. A breath fresh air seemed blow house, something better sunshine brightened quiet rooms. Everything appeared feel hopeful change. Beth’s bird began chirp again, half-blown rose discovered Amy’s bush window. The fires seemed burn unusual cheeriness, every time girls met, pale faces broke smiles hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, “Mother’s coming, dear! Mother’s coming!” Every one rejoiced Beth. She lay heavy stupor, alike unconscious hope joy, doubt danger. It piteous sight, rosy face changed vacant, busy hands weak wasted, smiling lips quite dumb, pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough tangled pillow. All day lay so, rousing mutter, “Water!” lips parched could hardly shape word. All day Jo Meg hovered her, watching, waiting, hoping, trusting God Mother, day snow fell, bitter wind raged, hours dragged slowly by. But night came last, every time clock struck, sisters, still sitting either side bed, looked brightening eyes, hour brought help nearer. The doctor say change, better worse, would probably take place midnight, time would return. Hannah, quite worn out, lay sofa bed’s foot fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched fro parlor, feeling would rather face rebel battery Mrs. March’s countenance entered. Laurie lay rug, pretending rest, staring fire thoughtful look made black eyes beautifully soft clear. The girls never forgot night, sleep came kept watch, dreadful sense powerlessness comes us hours like those. “If God spares Beth, I never complain again,” whispered Meg earnestly. “If God spares Beth, I try love serve Him life,” answered Jo, equal fervor. “I wish I heart, aches so,” sighed Meg, pause. “If life often hard this, I see ever shall get it,” added sister despondently. Here clock struck twelve, forgot watching Beth, fancied change passed wan face. The house still death, nothing wailing wind broke deep hush. Weary Hannah slept on, one sisters saw pale shadow seemed fall upon little bed. An hour went by, nothing happened except Laurie’s quiet departure station. Another hour, still one came, anxious fears delay storm, accidents way, or, worst all, great grief Washington, haunted girls. It past two, Jo, stood window thinking dreary world looked winding sheet snow, heard movement bed, turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling mother’s easy chair face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly Jo, thought, “Beth dead, Meg afraid tell me.” She back post instant, excited eyes great change seemed taken place. The fever flush look pain gone, beloved little face looked pale peaceful utter repose Jo felt desire weep lament. Leaning low dearest sisters, kissed damp forehead heart lips, softly whispered, “Good-by, Beth. Good-by!” As awaked stir, Hannah started sleep, hurried bed, looked Beth, felt hands, listened lips, then, throwing apron head, sat rock fro, exclaiming, breath, “The fever’s turned, sleepin’ nat’ral, skin’s damp, breathes easy. Praise given! Oh, goodness me!” Before girls could believe happy truth, doctor came confirm it. He homely man, thought face quite heavenly smiled said, fatherly look them, “Yes, dears, I think little girl pull time. Keep house quiet, let sleep, wakes, give her...” What give, neither heard, crept dark hall, and, sitting stairs, held close, rejoicing hearts full words. When went back kissed cuddled faithful Hannah, found Beth lying, used do, cheek pillowed hand, dreadful pallor gone, breathing quietly, fallen asleep. “If Mother would come now!” said Jo, winter night began wane. “See,” said Meg, coming white, half-opened rose, “I thought would hardly ready lay Beth’s hand tomorrow she—went away us. But blossomed night, I mean put vase here, darling wakes, first thing sees little rose, Mother’s face.” Never sun risen beautifully, never world seemed lovely heavy eyes Meg Jo, looked early morning, long, sad vigil done. “It looks like fairy world,” said Meg, smiling herself, stood behind curtain, watching dazzling sight. “Hark!” cried Jo, starting feet. Yes, sound bells door below, cry Hannah, Laurie’s voice saying joyful whisper, “Girls, come! She come!” CHAPTER NINETEEN AMY’S WILL While things happening home, Amy hard times Aunt March’s. She felt exile deeply, first time life, realized much beloved petted home. Aunt March never petted one; approve it, meant kind, well-behaved little girl pleased much, Aunt March soft place old heart nephew’s children, though think proper confess it. She really best make Amy happy, but, dear me, mistakes made. Some old people keep young heart spite wrinkles gray hairs, sympathize children’s little cares joys, make feel home, hide wise lessons pleasant plays, giving receiving friendship sweetest way. But Aunt March gift, worried Amy much rules orders, prim ways, long, prosy talks. Finding child docile amiable sister, old lady felt duty try counteract, far possible, bad effects home freedom indulgence. So took Amy hand, taught taught sixty years ago, process carried dismay Amy’s soul, made feel like fly web strict spider. She wash cups every morning, polish old-fashioned spoons, fat silver teapot, glasses till shone. Then must dust room, trying job was. Not speck escaped Aunt March’s eye, furniture claw legs much carving, never dusted suit. Then Polly fed, lap dog combed, dozen trips upstairs get things deliver orders, old lady lame seldom left big chair. After tiresome labors, must lessons, daily trial every virtue possessed. Then allowed one hour exercise play, enjoy it? Laurie came every day, wheedled Aunt March till Amy allowed go him, walked rode capital times. After dinner, read aloud, sit still old lady slept, usually hour, dropped first page. Then patchwork towels appeared, Amy sewed outward meekness inward rebellion till dusk, allowed amuse liked till teatime. The evenings worst all, Aunt March fell telling long stories youth, unutterably dull Amy always ready go bed, intending cry hard fate, usually going sleep squeezed tear two. If Laurie, old Esther, maid, felt never could got dreadful time. The parrot alone enough drive distracted, soon felt admire him, revenged mischievous possible. He pulled hair whenever came near him, upset bread milk plague newly cleaned cage, made Mop bark pecking Madam dozed, called names company, behaved respects like reprehensible old bird. Then could endure dog, fat, cross beast snarled yelped made toilet, lay back legs air idiotic expression countenance wanted something eat, dozen times day. The cook bad-tempered, old coachman deaf, Esther one ever took notice young lady. Esther Frenchwoman, lived ‘Madame’, called mistress, many years, rather tyrannized old lady, could get along without her. Her real name Estelle, Aunt March ordered change it, obeyed, condition never asked change religion. She took fancy Mademoiselle, amused much odd stories life France, Amy sat got Madame’s laces. She also allowed roam great house, examine curious pretty things stored away big wardrobes ancient chests, Aunt March hoarded like magpie. Amy’s chief delight Indian cabinet, full queer drawers, little pigeonholes, secret places, kept sorts ornaments, precious, merely curious, less antique. To examine arrange things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially jewel cases, velvet cushions reposed ornaments adorned belle forty years ago. There garnet set Aunt March wore came out, pearls father gave wedding day, lover’s diamonds, jet mourning rings pins, queer lockets, portraits dead friends weeping willows made hair inside, baby bracelets one little daughter worn, Uncle March’s big watch, red seal many childish hands played with, box lay Aunt March’s wedding ring, small fat finger, put carefully away like precious jewel all. “Which would Mademoiselle choose will?” asked Esther, always sat near watch lock valuables. “I like diamonds best, necklace among them, I fond necklaces, becoming. I choose I might,” replied Amy, looking great admiration string gold ebony beads hung heavy cross same. “I, too, covet that, necklace. Ah, no! To rosary, I use like good catholic,” said Esther, eyeing handsome thing wistfully. “Is meant use use string good-smelling wooden beads hanging glass?” asked Amy. “Truly, yes, pray with. It would pleasing saints one used fine rosary this, instead wearing vain bijou.” “You seem take great deal comfort prayers, Esther, always come looking quiet satisfied. I wish I could.” “If Mademoiselle Catholic, would find true comfort, be, would well went apart day meditate pray, good mistress I served Madame. She little chapel, found solacement much trouble.” “Would right too?” asked Amy, loneliness felt need help sort, found apt forget little book, Beth remind it. “It would excellent charming, I shall gladly arrange little dressing room like it. Say nothing Madame, sleeps go sit alone think good thoughts, pray dear God preserve sister.” Esther truly pious, quite sincere advice, affectionate heart, felt much sisters anxiety. Amy liked idea, gave leave arrange light closet next room, hoping would good. “I wish I knew pretty things would go Aunt March dies,” said, slowly replaced shining rosary shut jewel cases one one. “To sisters. I know it, Madame confides me. I witnessed will, so,” whispered Esther smiling. “How nice! But I wish would let us now. Procrastination agreeable,” observed Amy, taking last look diamonds. “It soon yet young ladies wear things. The first one affianced pearls, Madame said it, I fancy little turquoise ring given go, Madame approves good behavior charming manners.” “Do think so? Oh, I lamb, I lovely ring! It ever much prettier Kitty Bryant’s. I like Aunt March all.” And Amy tried blue ring delighted face firm resolve earn it. From day model obedience, old lady complacently admired success training. Esther fitted closet little table, placed footstool it, picture taken one shut-up rooms. She thought great value, but, appropriate, borrowed it, well knowing Madame would never know it, care did. It was, however, valuable copy one famous pictures world, Amy’s beauty-loving eyes never tired looking sweet face Divine Mother, tender thoughts busy heart. On table laid little testament hymnbook, kept vase always full best flowers Laurie brought her, came every day ‘sit alone’ thinking good thoughts, praying dear God preserve sister. Esther given rosary black beads silver cross, Amy hung use it, feeling doubtful fitness Protestant prayers. The little girl sincere this, left alone outside safe home nest, felt need kind hand hold sorely instinctively turned strong tender Friend, whose fatherly love closely surrounds His little children. She missed mother’s help understand rule herself, taught look, best find way walk confidingly. But, Amy young pilgrim, burden seemed heavy. She tried forget herself, keep cheerful, satisfied right, though one saw praised it. In first effort very, good, decided make will, Aunt March done, fall ill die, possessions might justly generously divided. It cost pang even think giving little treasures eyes precious old lady’s jewels. During one play hours wrote important document well could, help Esther certain legal terms, good-natured Frenchwoman signed name, Amy felt relieved laid show Laurie, wanted second witness. As rainy day, went upstairs amuse one large chambers, took Polly company. In room wardrobe full old-fashioned costumes Esther allowed play, favorite amusement array faded brocades, parade long mirror, making stately curtsies, sweeping train rustle delighted ears. So busy day hear Laurie’s ring see face peeping gravely promenaded fro, flirting fan tossing head, wore great pink turban, contrasting oddly blue brocade dress yellow quilted petticoat. She obliged walk carefully, high-heeled shoes, and, Laurie told Jo afterward, comical sight see mince along gay suit, Polly sidling bridling behind her, imitating well could, occasionally stopping laugh exclaim, “Are fine? Get along, fright! Hold tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha! Ha!” Having difficulty restrained explosion merriment, lest offend majesty, Laurie tapped graciously received. “Sit rest I put things away, I want consult serious matter,” said Amy, shown splendor driven Polly corner. “That bird trial life,” continued, removing pink mountain head, Laurie seated astride chair. “Yesterday, Aunt asleep I trying still mouse, Polly began squall flap cage, I went let out, found big spider there. I poked out, ran bookcase. Polly marched straight it, stooped peeped bookcase, saying, funny way, cock eye, ‘Come take walk, dear.’ I could help laughing, made Poll swear, Aunt woke scolded us both.” “Did spider accept old fellow’s invitation?” asked Laurie, yawning. “Yes, came, away ran Polly, frightened death, scrambled Aunt’s chair, calling out, ‘Catch her! Catch her! Catch her!’ I chased spider.” “That lie! Oh, lor!” cried parrot, pecking Laurie’s toes. “I would wring neck mine, old torment,” cried Laurie, shaking fist bird, put head one side gravely croaked, “Allyluyer! bless buttons, dear!” “Now I ready,” said Amy, shutting wardrobe taking piece paper pocket. “I want read that, please, tell legal right. I felt I ought it, life uncertain I want ill feeling tomb.” Laurie bit lips, turning little pensive speaker, read following document, praiseworthy gravity, considering spelling: MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT I, Amy Curtis March, sane mind, go give bequeethe earthly property—viz. wit:—namely To father, best pictures, sketches, maps, works art, including frames.

Amy Curtis March Witnesses: Estelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence. The last name written pencil, Amy explained rewrite ink seal properly. “What put head?

She explained asked anxiously, “What Beth?” “I sorry I spoke, I did, I tell you. She felt ill one day told Jo wanted give piano Meg, cats you, poor old doll Jo, would love sake. She sorry little give, left locks hair rest us, best love Grandpa. She never thought will.” Laurie signing sealing spoke, look till great tear dropped paper. Amy’s face full trouble, said, “Do people put sort postscripts wills, sometimes?” “Yes, ‘codicils’, call them.” “Put one mine then, I wish curls cut off, given round friends. I forgot it, I want done though spoil looks.” Laurie added it, smiling Amy’s last greatest sacrifice. Then amused hour, much interested trials. But came go, Amy held back whisper trembling lips, “Is really danger Beth?” “I afraid is, must hope best, cry, dear.” And Laurie put arm brotherly gesture comforting. When gone, went little chapel, sitting twilight, prayed Beth, streaming tears aching heart, feeling million turquoise rings would console loss gentle little sister. CHAPTER TWENTY CONFIDENTIAL I think I words tell meeting mother daughters. Such hours beautiful live, hard describe, I leave imagination readers, merely saying house full genuine happiness, Meg’s tender hope realized, Beth woke long, healing sleep, first objects eyes fell little rose Mother’s face. Too weak wonder anything, smiled nestled close loving arms her, feeling hungry longing satisfied last. Then slept again, girls waited upon mother, would unclasp thin hand clung even sleep. Hannah ‘dished up’ astonishing breakfast traveler, finding impossible vent excitement way, Meg Jo fed mother like dutiful young storks, listened whispered account Father’s state, Mr. Brooke’s promise stay nurse him, delays storm occasioned homeward journey, unspeakable comfort Laurie’s hopeful face given arrived, worn fatigue, anxiety, cold. What strange yet pleasant day was. So brilliant gay without, world seemed abroad welcome first snow. So quiet reposeful within, everyone slept, spent watching, Sabbath stillness reigned house, nodding Hannah mounted guard door. With blissful sense burdens lifted off, Meg Jo closed weary eyes, lay rest, like storm-beaten boats safe anchor quiet harbor. Mrs. March would leave Beth’s side, rested big chair, waking often look at, touch, brood child, like miser recovered treasure. Laurie meanwhile posted comfort Amy, told story well Aunt March actually ‘sniffed’ herself, never said “I told so”. Amy came strong occasion I think good thoughts little chapel really began bear fruit. She dried tears quickly, restrained impatience see mother, never even thought turquoise ring, old lady heartily agreed Laurie’s opinion, behaved ‘like capital little woman’. Even Polly seemed impressed, called good girl, blessed buttons, begged “come take walk, dear”, affable tone. She would gladly gone enjoy bright wintry weather, discovering Laurie dropping sleep spite manful efforts conceal fact, persuaded rest sofa, wrote note mother. She long time it, returned, stretched arms head, sound asleep, Aunt March pulled curtains sat nothing unusual fit benignity. After while, began think going wake till night, I sure would, effectually roused Amy’s cry joy sight mother. There probably good many happy little girls city day, private opinion Amy happiest all, sat mother’s lap told trials, receiving consolation compensation shape approving smiles fond caresses. They alone together chapel, mother object purpose explained her. “On contrary, I like much, dear,” looking dusty rosary well-worn little book, lovely picture garland evergreen. “It excellent plan place go quiet, things vex grieve us. There good many hard times life ours, always bear ask help right way. I think little girl learning this.” “Yes, Mother, I go home I mean corner big closet put books copy picture I tried make. The woman’s face good, beautiful draw, baby done better, I love much. I like think He little child once, I seem far away, helps me.” As Amy pointed smiling Christ child Mother’s knee, Mrs. March saw something lifted hand made smile. She said nothing, Amy understood look, minute’s pause, added gravely, “I wanted speak this, I forgot it. Aunt gave ring today. She called kissed me, put finger, said I credit her, would like keep always. She gave funny guard keep turquoise on, big. I would like wear Mother, I?” “They pretty, I think rather young ornaments, Amy,” said Mrs. March, looking plump little hand, band sky-blue stones forefinger, quaint guard formed two tiny golden hands clasped together. “I try vain,” said Amy. “I think I like pretty, I want wear girl story wore bracelet, remind something.” “Do mean Aunt March?” asked mother, laughing. “No, remind selfish.” Amy looked earnest sincere mother stopped laughing, listened respectfully little plan. “I thought great deal lately ‘bundle naughties’, selfish largest one it, I going try hard cure it, I can.

Now I must go back Beth. Keep heart, little daughter, soon home again.” That evening Meg writing father report traveler’s safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs Beth’s room, finding mother usual place, stood minute twisting fingers hair, worried gesture undecided look. “What it, deary?” asked Mrs. March, holding hand, face invited confidence. “I want tell something, Mother.” “About Meg?” “How quickly guessed!

She eats drinks sleeps like sensible creature, looks straight face I talk man, blushes little bit Teddy jokes lovers. I forbid it, mind ought.” “Then fancy Meg interested John?” “Who?” cried Jo, staring. “Mr. Brooke. I call ‘John’ now. We fell way hospital, likes it.” “Oh, dear! I know take part. He good Father, send away, let Meg marry him, wants to. Mean thing! To go petting Papa helping you, wheedle liking him.” And Jo pulled hair wrathful tweak. “My dear, get angry it, I tell happened.

He wanted leave love work her, right make love could. He truly excellent young man, could refuse listen him, I consent Meg’s engaging young.” “Of course not. It would idiotic! I knew mischief brewing. I felt it, worse I imagined. I wish I could marry Meg myself, keep safe family.” This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, said gravely, “Jo, I confide wish say anything Meg yet. When John comes back, I see together, I judge better feelings toward him.” “She see handsome eyes talks about, her. She got soft heart, melt like butter sun anyone looks sentimentlly her. She read short reports sent letters, pinched I spoke it, likes brown eyes, think John ugly name, go fall love, end peace fun, cozy times together. I see all! They go lovering around house, shall dodge. Meg absorbed good more. Brooke scratch fortune somehow, carry off, make hole family, I shall break heart, everything abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! Why boys, would bother.” Jo leaned chin knees disconsolate attitude shook fist reprehensible John. Mrs. March sighed, Jo looked air relief. “You like it, Mother? I glad it. Let us send business, tell Meg word it, happy together always been.” “I wrong sigh, Jo. It natural right go homes time, I want keep girls long I can, I sorry happened soon, Meg seventeen years John make home her. Your father I agreed shall bind way, married, twenty. If John love one another, wait, test love so. She conscientious, I fear treating unkindly. My pretty, tender hearted girl! I hope things go happily her.” “Had rather marry rich man?” asked Jo, mother’s voice faltered little last words. “Money good useful thing, Jo, I hope girls never feel need bitterly, tempted much. I like know John firmly established good business, gave income large enough keep free debt make Meg comfortable. I ambitious splendid fortune, fashionable position, great name girls. If rank money come love virtue, also, I accept gratefully, enjoy good fortune, I know, experience, much genuine happiness plain little house, daily bread earned, privations give sweetness pleasures. I content see Meg begin humbly, I mistaken, rich possession good man’s heart, better fortune.” “I understand, Mother, quite agree, I disappointed Meg, I would planned marry Teddy by-and-by sit lap luxury days. Would nice?” asked Jo, looking brighter face. “He younger she, know,” began Mrs. March, Jo broke in... “Only little, old age, tall, quite grown-up manners likes. Then rich generous good, loves us all, I say pity plan spoiled.” “I afraid Laurie hardly grown-up enough Meg, altogether much weathercock anyone depend on. Do make plans, Jo, let time hearts mate friends. We cannot meddle safely matters, better get ‘romantic rubbish’ call it, heads, lest spoil friendship.” “Well, I not, I hate see things going crisscross getting snarled up, pull snip would straighten out. I wish wearing flatirons heads would keep us growing up. But buds roses, kittens cats, more’s pity!” “What flatirons cats?” asked Meg, crept room finished letter hand. “Only one stupid speeches. I going bed. Come, Peggy,” said Jo, unfolding like animated puzzle. “Quite right, beautifully written. Please add I send love John,” said Mrs. March, glanced letter gave back. “Do call ‘John’?” asked Meg, smiling, innocent eyes looking mother’s. “Yes, like son us, fond him,” replied Mrs. March, returning look keen one. “I glad that, lonely. Good night, Mother, dear. It inexpressibly comfortable here,” Meg’s answer. The kiss mother gave tender one, went away, Mrs. March said, mixture satisfaction regret, “She love John yet, soon learn to.” CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE LAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE Jo’s face study next day, secret rather weighed upon her, found hard look mysterious important. Meg observed it, trouble make inquiries, learned best way manage Jo law contraries, felt sure told everything ask. She rather surprised, therefore, silence remained unbroken, Jo assumed patronizing air, decidedly aggravated Meg, turn assumed air dignified reserve devoted mother. This left Jo devices, Mrs. March taken place nurse, bade rest, exercise, amuse long confinement. Amy gone, Laurie refuge, much enjoyed society, rather dreaded then, incorrigible tease, feared would coax secret her. She quite right, mischief-loving lad sooner suspected mystery set find out, led Jo trying life it. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, scolded; affected indifference, might surprise truth her; declared knew, care; last, dint perseverance, satisfied concerned Meg Mr. Brooke. Feeling indignant taken tutor’s confidence, set wits work devise proper retaliation slight. Meg meanwhile apparently forgotten matter absorbed preparations father’s return, sudden change seemed come her, and, day two, quite unlike herself. She started spoken to, blushed looked at, quiet, sat sewing, timid, troubled look face. To mother’s inquiries answered quite well, Jo’s silenced begging let alone. “She feels air—love, I mean—and going fast. She got symptoms—is twittery cross, eat, lies awake, mopes corners. I caught singing song gave her, said ‘John’, do, turned red poppy. Whatever shall do?” said Jo, looking ready measures, however violent. “Nothing wait. Let alone, kind patient, Father’s coming settle everything,” replied mother. “Here note you, Meg, sealed up. How odd! Teddy never seals mine,” said Jo next day, distributed contents little post office. Mrs. March Jo deep affairs, sound Meg made look see staring note frightened face. “My child, it?” cried mother, running her, Jo tried take paper done mischief. “It mistake, send it. Oh, Jo, could it?” Meg hid face hands, crying heart quite broken. “Me! I done nothing! What talking about?” cried Jo, bewildered. Meg’s mild eyes kindled anger pulled crumpled note pocket threw Jo, saying reproachfully, “You wrote it, bad boy helped you. How could rude, mean, cruel us both?” Jo hardly heard her, mother reading note, written peculiar hand. “My Dearest Margaret, “I longer restrain passion, must know fate I return. I dare tell parents yet, I think would consent knew adored one another. Mr. Laurence help good place, then, sweet girl, make happy. I implore say nothing family yet, send one word hope Laurie to, “Your devoted John.” “Oh, little villain! That way meant pay keeping word Mother. I give hearty scolding bring beg pardon,” cried Jo, burning execute immediate justice. But mother held back, saying, look seldom wore... “Stop, Jo, must clear first. You played many pranks I afraid hand this.” “On word, Mother, I not! I never saw note before, know anything it, true I live!” said Jo, earnestly believed her. “If I taken part I would done better this, written sensible note. I think would known Mr. Brooke would write stuff that,” added, scornfully tossing paper. “It like writing,” faltered Meg, comparing note hand. “Oh, Meg, answer it?” cried Mrs. March quickly. “Yes, I did!” Meg hid face again, overcome shame. “Here scrape! Do let bring wicked boy explain lectured. I cannot rest till I get hold him.” And Jo made door again. “Hush! Let handle this, worse I thought. Margaret, tell whole story,” commanded Mrs. March, sitting Meg, yet keeping hold Jo, lest fly off. “I received first letter Laurie, look knew anything it,” began Meg, without looking up. “I worried first meant tell you, I remembered liked Mr. Brooke, I thought would mind I kept little secret days. I silly I liked think one knew, I deciding say, I felt like girls books, things do. Forgive me, Mother, I paid silliness now. I never look face again.” “What say him?” asked Mrs. March. “I said I young anything yet, I wish secrets you, must speak father. I grateful kindness, would friend, nothing more, long while.” Mrs. March smiled, well pleased, Jo clapped hands, exclaiming, laugh, “You almost equal Caroline Percy, pattern prudence! Tell on, Meg. What say that?” “He writes different way entirely, telling never sent love letter all, sorry roguish sister, Jo, take liberties names. It kind respectful, think dreadful me!” Meg leaned mother, looking image despair, Jo tramped room, calling Laurie names. All sudden stopped, caught two notes, looking closely, said decidedly, “I believe Brooke ever saw either letters. Teddy wrote both, keeps crow I would tell secret.” “Do secrets, Jo. Tell Mother keep trouble, I done,” said Meg warningly. “Bless you, child! Mother told me.” “That do, Jo. I comfort Meg go get Laurie. I shall sift matter bottom, put stop pranks once.” Away ran Jo, Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke’s real feelings. “Now, dear, own? Do love enough wait till make home you, keep quite free present?” “I scared worried, I want anything lovers long while, perhaps never,” answered Meg petulantly. “If John know anything nonsense, tell him, make Jo Laurie hold tongues. I deceived plagued made fool of. It shame!” Seeing Meg’s usually gentle temper roused pride hurt mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed promises entire silence great discretion future. The instant Laurie’s step heard hall, Meg fled study, Mrs. March received culprit alone. Jo told wanted, fearing would come, knew minute saw Mrs. March’s face, stood twirling hat guilty air convicted once. Jo dismissed, chose march hall like sentinel, fear prisoner might bolt. The sound voices parlor rose fell half hour, happened interview girls never knew. When called in, Laurie standing mother penitent face Jo forgave spot, think wise betray fact. Meg received humble apology, much comforted assurance Brooke knew nothing joke. “I never tell dying day, wild horses shall drag me, forgive me, Meg, I anything show out-and-out sorry I am,” added, looking much ashamed himself. “I try, ungentlemanly thing do, I think could sly malicious, Laurie,” replied Meg, trying hide maidenly confusion gravely reproachful air. “It altogether abominable, I deserve spoken month, will, though, you?” And Laurie folded hands together imploring gesture, spoke irresistibly persuasive tone, impossible frown upon spite scandalous behavior. Meg pardoned him, Mrs. March’s grave face relaxed, spite efforts keep sober, heard declare would atone sins sorts penances, abase like worm injured damsel. Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying harden heart him, succeeding primming face expression entire disapprobation. Laurie looked twice, showed sign relenting, felt injured, turned back till others done him, made low bow walked without word. As soon gone, wished forgiving, Meg mother went upstairs, felt lonely longed Teddy. After resisting time, yielded impulse, armed book return, went big house. “Is Mr. Laurence in?” asked Jo, housemaid, coming downstairs. “Yes, Miss, I believe seeable yet.” “Why not? Is ill?” “La, Miss, scene Mr. Laurie, one tantrums something, vexes old gentleman, I dursn’t go nigh him.” “Where Laurie?” “Shut room, answer, though I a-tapping. I know become dinner, ready, one eat it.” “I go see matter is. I afraid either them.” Up went Jo, knocked smartly door Laurie’s little study. “Stop that, I open door make you!” called young gentleman threatening tone. Jo immediately knocked again. The door flew open, bounced Laurie could recover surprise. Seeing really temper, Jo, knew manage him, assumed contrite expression, going artistically upon knees, said meekly, “Please forgive cross. I came make up, cannot go away till I have.” “It right. Get up, goose, Jo,” cavalier reply petition. “Thank you, I will. Could I ask matter? You look exactly easy mind.” “I shaken, I bear it!” growled Laurie indignantly. “Who it?” demanded Jo. “Grandfather. If anyone else I would have...” And injured youth finished sentence energetic gesture right arm. “That nothing. I often shake you, mind,” said Jo soothingly. “Pooh! You girl, fun, I allow man shake me!” “I think anyone would care try it, looked much like thundercloud now. Why treated so?” “Just I would say mother wanted for. I would promised tell, course I going break word.” “Could satisfy grandpa way?” “No, would truth, whole truth, nothing truth. I would told part scrape, I could without bringing Meg in. As I could not, I held tongue, bore scolding till old gentleman collared me. Then I bolted, fear I forget myself.” “It nice, sorry, I know, go make up. I help you.” “Hanged I do! I going lectured pummelled everyone, bit frolic. I sorry Meg, begged pardon like man, I again, I wrong.” “He know that.” “He ought trust me, act I baby. It use, Jo, got learn I able take care myself, need anyone’s apron string hold by.” “What pepper pots are!” sighed Jo. “How mean settle affair?” “Well, ought beg pardon, believe I say I cannot tell fuss’s about.” “Bless you! He that.” “I go till does.” “Now, Teddy, sensible. Let pass, I explain I can. You cannot stay here, use melodramatic?” “I intend stay long, anyway. I slip take journey somewhere, Grandpa misses come round fast enough.” “I dare say, ought go worry him.” “Do preach. I go Washington see Brooke. It gay there, I enjoy troubles.” “What fun would have! I wish I could run too,” said Jo, forgetting part mentor lively visions martial life capital. “Come on, then! Why not? You go surprise father, I stir old Brooke. It would glorious joke. Let us it, Jo. We leave letter saying right, trot once. I got money enough. It good, harm, go father.” For moment Jo looked would agree, wild plan was, suited her. She tired care confinement, longed change, thoughts father blended temptingly novel charms camps hospitals, liberty fun. Her eyes kindled turned wistfully toward window, fell old house opposite, shook head sorrowful decision. “If I boy, would run away together, capital time, I miserable girl, I must proper stop home. Do tempt me, Teddy, crazy plan.” “That fun it,” began Laurie, got willful fit possessed break bounds way. “Hold tongue!” cried Jo, covering ears. “‘Prunes prisms’ doom, I may well make mind it. I came moralize, hear things make skip think of.” “I know Meg would wet-blanket proposal, I thought spirit,” began Laurie insinuatingly. “Bad boy, quiet! Sit think sins, go making add mine. If I get grandpa apologize shaking, give running away?” asked Jo seriously. “Yes, it,” answered Laurie, wished make up, felt outraged dignity must appeased first. “If I manage young one, I old one,” muttered Jo, walked away, leaving Laurie bent railroad map head propped hands. “Come in!” Mr. Laurence’s gruff voice sounded gruffer ever, Jo tapped door. “It me, Sir, come return book,” said blandly, entered. “Want more?” asked old gentleman, looking grim vexed, trying show it. “Yes, please. I like old Sam well, I think I try second volume,” returned Jo, hoping propitiate accepting second dose Boswell’s Johnson, recommended lively work. The shaggy eyebrows unbent little rolled steps toward shelf Johnsonian literature placed. Jo skipped up, sitting top step, affected searching book, really wondering best introduce dangerous object visit. Mr. Laurence seemed suspect something brewing mind, taking several brisk turns room, faced round her, speaking abruptly Rasselas tumbled face downward floor. “What boy about? Do try shield him. I know mischief way acted came home. I cannot get word him, I threatened shake truth bolted upstairs locked room.” “He wrong, forgave him, promised say word anyone,” began Jo reluctantly. “That do. He shall shelter behind promise softhearted girls. If done anything amiss, shall confess, beg pardon, punished. Out it, Jo. I kept dark.” Mr. Laurence looked alarming spoke sharply Jo would gladly run away, could, perched aloft steps, stood foot, lion path, stay brave out. “Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell. Mother forbade it. Laurie confessed, asked pardon, punished quite enough. We keep silence shield him, someone else, make trouble interfere. Please not. It partly fault, right now. So let us forget it, talk _Rambler_ something pleasant.” “Hang _Rambler!_ Come give word harum-scarum boy mine done anything ungrateful impertinent. If has, kindness him, I thrash hands.” The threat sounded awful, alarm Jo, knew irascible old gentleman would never lift finger grandson, whatever might say contrary. She obediently descended, made light prank could without betraying Meg forgetting truth. “Hum... ha... well, boy held tongue promised, obstinacy, I forgive him. He stubborn fellow hard manage,” said Mr. Laurence, rubbing hair till looked gale, smoothing frown brow air relief. “So I, kind word govern king’s horses king’s men could not,” said Jo, trying say kind word friend, seemed get one scrape fall another. “You think I kind him, hey?” sharp answer. “Oh, dear no, Sir. You rather kind sometimes, trifle hasty tries patience. Do think are?” Jo determined now, tried look quite placid, though quaked little bold speech. To great relief surprise, old gentleman threw spectacles onto table rattle exclaimed frankly, “You right, girl, I am! I love boy, tries patience past bearing, I know end, go so.” “I tell you, run away.” Jo sorry speech minute made. She meant warn Laurie would bear much restraint, hoped would forebearing lad. Mr. Laurence’s ruddy face changed suddenly, sat down, troubled glance picture handsome man, hung table. It Laurie’s father, run away youth, married imperious old man’s will. Jo fancied remembered regretted past, wished held tongue. “He unless much worried, threatens sometimes, gets tired studying. I often think I like to, especially since hair cut, ever miss us, may advertise two boys look among ships bound India.” She laughed spoke, Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently taking whole joke. “You hussy, dare talk way? Where respect me, proper bringing up? Bless boys girls! What torments are, yet cannot without them,” said, pinching cheeks good-humoredly. “Go bring boy dinner, tell right, advise put tragedy airs grandfather. I bear it.” “He come, Sir. He feels badly believe said could tell. I think shaking hurt feelings much.” Jo tried look pathetic must failed, Mr. Laurence began laugh, knew day won. “I sorry that, ought thank shaking me, I suppose. What dickens fellow expect?” old gentleman looked trifle ashamed testiness. “If I you, I would write apology, Sir. He says come till one, talks Washington, goes absurd way. A formal apology make see foolish is, bring quite amiable. Try it. He likes fun, way better talking. I carry up, teach duty.” Mr. Laurence gave sharp look, put spectacles, saying slowly, “You sly puss, I mind managed Beth. Here, give bit paper, let us done nonsense.” The note written terms one gentleman would use another offering deep insult. Jo dropped kiss top Mr. Laurence’s bald head, ran slip apology Laurie’s door, advising keyhole submissive, decorous, agreeable impossibilities. Finding door locked again, left note work, going quietly away, young gentleman slid banisters, waited bottom, saying, virtuous expression countenance, “What good fellow are, Jo! Did get blown up?” added, laughing. “No, pretty mild, whole.” “Ah! I got round. Even cast there, I felt ready go deuce,” began apologetically. “Do talk way, turn new leaf begin again, Teddy, son.” “I keep turning new leaves, spoiling them, I used spoil copybooks, I make many beginnings never end,” said dolefully. “Go eat dinner, feel better it. Men always croak hungry,” Jo whisked front door that. “That ‘label’ ‘sect’,” answered Laurie, quoting Amy, went partake humble pie dutifully grandfather, quite saintly temper overwhelmingly respectful manner rest day. Everyone thought matter ended little cloud blown over, mischief done, though others forgot it, Meg remembered. She never alluded certain person, thought good deal, dreamed dreams ever, Jo, rummaging sister’s desk stamps, found bit paper scribbled words, ‘Mrs. John Brooke’, whereat groaned tragically cast fire, feeling Laurie’s prank hastened evil day her. CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO PLEASANT MEADOWS Like sunshine storm peaceful weeks followed. The invalids improved rapidly, Mr. March began talk returning early new year. Beth soon able lie study sofa day, amusing well-beloved cats first, time doll’s sewing, fallen sadly behind-hand. Her active limbs stiff feeble Jo took daily airing house strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened burned white hands cooking delicate messes ‘the dear’, Amy, loyal slave ring, celebrated return giving away many treasures could prevail sisters accept. As Christmas approached, usual mysteries began haunt house, Jo frequently convulsed family proposing utterly impossible magnificently absurd ceremonies, honor unusually merry Christmas. Laurie equally impracticable, would bonfires, skyrockets, triumphal arches, way. After many skirmishes snubbings, ambitious pair considered effectually quenched went forlorn faces, rather belied explosions laughter two got together. Several days unusually mild weather fitly ushered splendid Christmas Day. Hannah ‘felt bones’ going unusually fine day, proved true prophetess, everybody everything seemed bound produce grand success. To begin with, Mr. March wrote soon them, Beth felt uncommonly well morning, and, dressed mother’s gift, soft crimson merino wrapper, borne high triumph window behold offering Jo Laurie. The Unquenchables done best worthy name, like elves worked night conjured comical surprise. Out garden stood stately snow maiden, crowned holly, bearing basket fruit flowers one hand, great roll music other, perfect rainbow Afghan round chilly shoulders, Christmas carol issuing lips pink paper streamer. THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH God bless you, dear Queen Bess! May nothing dismay, But health peace happiness Be yours, Christmas day. Here fruit feed busy bee, And flowers nose. Here music pianee, An afghan toes, A portrait Joanna, see, By Raphael No. 2, Who laboured great industry To make fair true. Accept ribbon red, I beg, For Madam Purrer’s tail, And ice cream made lovely Peg, A Mont Blanc pail. Their dearest love makers laid Within breast snow. Accept it, Alpine maid, From Laurie Jo. How Beth laughed saw it, Laurie ran bring gifts, ridiculous speeches Jo made presented them. “I full happiness, Father here, I could hold one drop more,” said Beth, quite sighing contentment Jo carried study rest excitement, refresh delicious grapes ‘Jungfrau’ sent her. “So I,” added Jo, slapping pocket wherein reposed long-desired _Undine Sintram_. “I sure I am,” echoed Amy, poring engraved copy Madonna Child, mother given pretty frame. “Of course I am!” cried Meg, smoothing silvery folds first silk dress, Mr. Laurence insisted giving it. “How I otherwise?” said Mrs. March gratefully, eyes went husband’s letter Beth’s smiling face, hand caressed brooch made gray golden, chestnut dark brown hair, girls fastened breast. Now then, workaday world, things happen delightful storybook fashion, comfort is. Half hour everyone said happy could hold one drop more, drop came. Laurie opened parlor door popped head quietly. He might well turned somersault uttered Indian war whoop, face full suppressed excitement voice treacherously joyful everyone jumped up, though said, queer, breathless voice, “Here another Christmas present March family.” Before words well mouth, whisked away somehow, place appeared tall man, muffled eyes, leaning arm another tall man, tried say something could not. Of course general stampede, several minutes everybody seemed lose wits, strangest things done, one said word. Mr. March became invisible embrace four pairs loving arms. Jo disgraced nearly fainting away, doctored Laurie china closet. Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely mistake, somewhat incoherently explained. And Amy, dignified, tumbled stool, never stopping get up, hugged cried father’s boots touching manner. Mrs. March first recover herself, held hand warning, “Hush! Remember Beth.” But late. The study door flew open, little red wrapper appeared threshold, joy put strength feeble limbs, Beth ran straight father’s arms. Never mind happened that, full hearts overflowed, washing away bitterness past leaving sweetness present. It romantic, hearty laugh set everybody straight again, Hannah discovered behind door, sobbing fat turkey, forgotten put rushed kitchen. As laugh subsided, Mrs. March began thank Mr. Brooke faithful care husband, Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered Mr. March needed rest, seizing Laurie, precipitately retired. Then two invalids ordered repose, did, sitting one big chair talking hard. Mr. March told longed surprise them, how, fine weather came, allowed doctor take advantage it, devoted Brooke been, altogether estimable upright young man. Why Mr. March paused minute there, glance Meg, violently poking fire, looked wife inquiring lift eyebrows, I leave imagine. Also Mrs. March gently nodded head asked, rather abruptly, would like something eat. Jo saw understood look, stalked grimly away get wine beef tea, muttering slammed door, “I hate estimable young men brown eyes!” There never Christmas dinner day. The fat turkey sight behold, Hannah sent up, stuffed, browned, decorated. So plum pudding, melted one’s mouth, likewise jellies, Amy reveled like fly honeypot. Everything turned well, mercy, Hannah said, “For mind flustered, Mum, merrycle I roast pudding, stuff turkey raisins, let alone bilin’ cloth.” Mr. Laurence grandson dined them, also Mr. Brooke, Jo glowered darkly, Laurie’s infinite amusement. Two easy chairs stood side side head table, sat Beth father, feasting modestly chicken little fruit. They drank healths, told stories, sang songs, ‘reminisced’, old folks say, thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride planned, girls would leave father, guests departed early, twilight gathered, happy family sat together round fire. “Just year ago groaning dismal Christmas expected have. Do remember?” asked Jo, breaking short pause followed long conversation many things. “Rather pleasant year whole!” said Meg, smiling fire, congratulating treated Mr. Brooke dignity. “I think pretty hard one,” observed Amy, watching light shine ring thoughtful eyes. “I glad over, got back,” whispered Beth, sat father’s knee. “Rather rough road travel, little pilgrims, especially latter part it. But got bravely, I think burdens fair way tumble soon,” said Mr. March, looking fatherly satisfaction four young faces gathered round him. “How know? Did Mother tell you?” asked Jo. “Not much. Straws show way wind blows, I made several discoveries today.” “Oh, tell us are!” cried Meg, sat beside him. “Here one.” And taking hand lay arm chair, pointed roughened forefinger, burn back, two three little hard spots palm. “I remember time hand white smooth, first care keep so. It pretty then, much prettier now, seeming blemishes I read little history. A burnt offering made vanity, hardened palm earned something better blisters, I sure sewing done pricked fingers last long time, much good went stitches. Meg, dear, I value womanly skill keeps home happy white hands fashionable accomplishments. I proud shake good, industrious little hand, hope I shall soon asked give away.” If Meg wanted reward hours patient labor, received hearty pressure father’s hand approving smile gave her. “What Jo? Please say something nice, tried hard very, good me,” said Beth father’s ear. He laughed looked across tall girl sat opposite, unusually mild expression face. “In spite curly crop, I see ‘son Jo’ I left year ago,” said Mr. March. “I see young lady pins collar straight, laces boots neatly, neither whistles, talks slang, lies rug used do. Her face rather thin pale now, watching anxiety, I like look it, grown gentler, voice lower. She bounce, moves quietly, takes care certain little person motherly way delights me. I rather miss wild girl, I get strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I know whether shearing sobered black sheep, I know Washington I could find anything beautiful enough bought five-and-twenty dollars good girl sent me.” Jo’s keen eyes rather dim minute, thin face grew rosy firelight received father’s praise, feeling deserve portion it. “Now, Beth,” said Amy, longing turn, ready wait. “There little her, I afraid say much, fear slip away altogether, though shy used be,” began father cheerfully. But recollecting nearly lost her, held close, saying tenderly, cheek own, “I got safe, Beth, I keep so, please God.” After minute’s silence, looked Amy, sat cricket feet, said, caress shining hair... “I observed Amy took drumsticks dinner, ran errands mother afternoon, gave Meg place tonight, waited every one patience good humor. I also observe fret much look glass, even mentioned pretty ring wears, I conclude learned think people less, decided try mold character carefully molds little clay figures. I glad this, though I proud graceful statue made her, I shall infinitely prouder lovable daughter talent making life beautiful others.” “What thinking of, Beth?” asked Jo, Amy thanked father told ring. “I read _Pilgrim’s Progress_ today how, many troubles, Christian Hopeful came pleasant green meadow lilies bloomed year round, rested happily, now, went journey’s end,” answered Beth, adding, slipped father’s arms went instrument, “It singing time now, I want old place. I try sing song shepherd boy Pilgrims heard. I made music Father, likes verses.” So, sitting dear little piano, Beth softly touched keys, sweet voice never thought hear again, sang accompaniment quaint hymn, singularly fitting song her. He need fear fall, He low pride. He humble ever shall Have God guide. I content I have, Little it, much. And, Lord! Contentment still I crave, Because Thou savest such. Fulness burden is, That go pilgrimage. Here little, hereafter bliss, Is best age age! CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE AUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION Like bees swarming queen, mother daughters hovered Mr. March next day, neglecting everything look at, wait upon, listen new invalid, fair way killed kindness. As sat propped big chair Beth’s sofa, three close by, Hannah popping head ‘to peek dear man’, nothing seemed needed complete happiness. But something needed, elder ones felt it, though none confessed fact. Mr. Mrs. March looked one another anxious expression, eyes followed Meg. Jo sudden fits sobriety, seen shake fist Mr. Brooke’s umbrella, left hall. Meg absent-minded, shy, silent, started bell rang, colored John’s name mentioned. Amy said, “Everyone seemed waiting something, could settle down, queer, since Father safe home,” Beth innocently wondered neighbors run usual. Laurie went afternoon, seeing Meg window, seemed suddenly possessed melodramatic fit, fell one knee snow, beat breast, tore hair, clasped hands imploringly, begging boon. And Meg told behave go away, wrung imaginary tears handkerchief, staggered round corner utter despair. “What goose mean?” said Meg, laughing trying look unconscious. “He showing John go by-and-by. Touching, it?” answered Jo scornfully. “Do say John, proper true,” Meg’s voice lingered words sounded pleasant her. “Please plague me, Jo, I told I care much him, anything said, friendly, go before.” “We cannot, something said, Laurie’s mischief spoiled me. I see it, Mother. You like old self bit, seem ever far away me. I mean plague bear like man, I wish settled. I hate wait, mean ever it, make haste quickly,” said Jo pettishly. “I cannot say anything till speaks, not, Father said I young,” began Meg, bending work queer little smile, suggested quite agree father point. “If speak, would know say, would cry blush, let way, instead giving good, decided no.” “I silly weak think. I know I say, I planned all, I need taken unawares. There knowing may happen, I wished prepared.” Jo could help smiling important air Meg unconsciously assumed becoming pretty color varying cheeks. “Would mind telling would say?” asked Jo respectfully. “Not all. You sixteen now, quite old enough confidant, experience useful by-and-by, perhaps, affairs sort.” “Do mean any. It fun watch people philander, I feel like fool myself,” said Jo, looking alarmed thought. “I think not, liked anyone much, liked you.” Meg spoke herself, glanced lane often seen lovers walking together summer twilight. “I thought going tell speech man,” said Jo, rudely shortening sister’s little reverie. “Oh, I merely say, quite calmly decidedly, ‘Thank you, Mr. Brooke, kind, I agree Father I young enter engagement present, please say more, let us friends were.’” “Hum, stiff cool enough! I believe ever say it, I know satisfied do. If goes like rejected lovers books, give in, rather hurt feelings.” “No, I not. I shall tell I made mind, shall walk room dignity.” Meg rose spoke, going rehearse dignified exit, step hall made fly seat begin sew fast life depended finishing particular seam given time. Jo smothered laugh sudden change, someone gave modest tap, opened door grim aspect anything hospitable. “Good afternoon. I came get umbrella, is, see father finds today,” said Mr. Brooke, getting trifle confused eyes went one telltale face other. “It well, rack. I get him, tell here.” And jumbled father umbrella well together reply, Jo slipped room give Meg chance make speech air dignity. But instant vanished, Meg began sidle toward door, murmuring... “Mother like see you. Pray sit down, I call her.” “Do go. Are afraid me, Margaret?” Mr. Brooke looked hurt Meg thought must done something rude. She blushed little curls forehead, never called Margaret before, surprised find natural sweet seemed hear say it. Anxious appear friendly ease, put hand confiding gesture, said gratefully... “How I afraid kind Father? I wish I could thank it.” “Shall I tell how?” asked Mr. Brooke, holding small hand fast own, looking Meg much love brown eyes heart began flutter, longed run away stop listen. “Oh no, please not, I would rather not,” said, trying withdraw hand, looking frightened spite denial. “I trouble you. I want know care little, Meg. I love much, dear,” added Mr. Brooke tenderly. This moment calm, proper speech, Meg make it. She forgot every word it, hung head, answered, “I know,” softly John stoop catch foolish little reply. He seemed think worth trouble, smiled quite satisfied, pressed plump hand gratefully, said persuasive tone, “Will try find out? I want know much, I cannot go work heart I learn whether I reward end not.” “I young,” faltered Meg, wondering fluttered, yet rather enjoying it. “I wait, meantime, could learning like me. Would hard lesson, dear?” “Not I chose learn it, but. . .” “Please choose learn, Meg. I love teach, easier German,” broke John, getting possession hand, way hiding face bent look it. His tone properly beseeching, stealing shy look him, Meg saw eyes merry well tender, wore satisfied smile one doubt success. This nettled her. Annie Moffat’s foolish lessons coquetry came mind, love power, sleeps bosoms best little women, woke sudden took possession her. She felt excited strange, knowing else do, followed capricious impulse, and, withdrawing hands, said petulantly, “I choose. Please go away let be!” Poor Mr. Brooke looked lovely castle air tumbling ears, never seen Meg mood before, rather bewildered him. “Do really mean that?” asked anxiously, following walked away. “Yes, I do. I want worried things. Father says I need not, soon I would rather not.” “May I hope change mind by-and-by? I wait say nothing till time. Do play me, Meg. I think you.” “Do think all. I would rather would not,” said Meg, taking naughty satisfaction trying lover’s patience power. He grave pale now, looked decidedly like novel heroes admired, neither slapped forehead tramped room did. He stood looking wistfully, tenderly, found heart relenting spite herself. What would happened next I cannot say, Aunt March come hobbling interesting minute. The old lady could resist longing see nephew, met Laurie took airing, hearing Mr. March’s arrival, drove straight see him. The family busy back part house, made way quietly in, hoping surprise them. She surprise two much Meg started seen ghost, Mr. Brooke vanished study. “Bless me, this?” cried old lady rap cane glanced pale young gentleman scarlet young lady. “It Father’s friend. I surprised see you!” stammered Meg, feeling lecture now. “That evident,” returned Aunt March, sitting down. “But Father’s friend saying make look like peony? There mischief going on, I insist upon knowing is,” another rap. “We talking. Mr. Brooke came umbrella,” began Meg, wishing Mr. Brooke umbrella safely house. “Brooke? That boy’s tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know it. Jo blundered wrong message one Father’s letters, I made tell me. You gone accepted him, child?” cried Aunt March, looking scandalized. “Hush! He hear. Shall I call Mother?” said Meg, much troubled. “Not yet. I something say you, I must free mind once. Tell me, mean marry Cook? If do, one penny money ever goes you. Remember that, sensible girl,” said old lady impressively. Now Aunt March possessed perfection art rousing spirit opposition gentlest people, enjoyed it. The best us spice perversity us, especially young love. If Aunt March begged Meg accept John Brooke, would probably declared could think it, preemptorily ordered like him, immediately made mind would. Inclination well perversity made decision easy, already much excited, Meg opposed old lady unusual spirit. “I shall marry I please, Aunt March, leave money anyone like,” said, nodding head resolute air. “Highty-tighty! Is way take advice, Miss? You sorry by-and-by, tried love cottage found failure.” “It cannot worse one people find big houses,” retorted Meg. Aunt March put glasses took look girl, know new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, felt brave independent, glad defend John assert right love him, liked. Aunt March saw begun wrong, little pause, made fresh start, saying mildly could, “Now, Meg, dear, reasonable take advice. I mean kindly, want spoil whole life making mistake beginning. You ought marry well help family. It duty make rich match ought impressed upon you.” “Father Mother think so. They like John though poor.” “Your parents, dear, worldly wisdom pair babies.” “I glad it,” cried Meg stoutly. Aunt March took notice, went lecture. “This Rook poor got rich relations, he?” “No, many warm friends.” “You cannot live friends, try see cool grow. He business, he?” “Not yet. Mr. Laurence going help him.” “That last long. James Laurence crotchety old fellow depended on. So intend marry man without money, position, business, go working harder now, might comfortable days minding better? I thought sense, Meg.” “I could better I waited half life! John good wise, got heaps talent, willing work sure get on, energetic brave. Everyone likes respects him, I proud think cares me, though I poor young silly,” said Meg, looking prettier ever earnestness. “He knows got rich relations, child. That secret liking, I suspect.” “Aunt March, dare say thing? John meanness, I listen minute talk so,” cried Meg indignantly, forgetting everything injustice old lady’s suspicions. “My John would marry money, I would. We willing work mean wait. I afraid poor, I happy far, I know I shall loves me, I...” Meg stopped there, remembering sudden made mind, told ‘her John’ go away, might overhearing inconsistent remarks. Aunt March angry, set heart pretty niece make fine match, something girl’s happy young face made lonely old woman feel sad sour. “Well, I wash hands whole affair! You willful child, lost know piece folly. No, I stop. I disappointed you, spirits see father now. Do expect anything married. Your Mr. Brooke’s friends must take care you. I done forever.” And slamming door Meg’s face, Aunt March drove high dudgeon. She seemed take girl’s courage her, left alone, Meg stood moment, undecided whether laugh cry. Before could make mind, taken possession Mr. Brooke, said one breath, “I could help hearing, Meg. Thank defending me, Aunt March proving care little bit.” “I know much till abused you,” began Meg. “And I need go away, may stay happy, may I, dear?” Here another fine chance make crushing speech stately exit, Meg never thought either, disgraced forever Jo’s eyes meekly whispering, “Yes, John,” hiding face Mr. Brooke’s waistcoat. Fifteen minutes Aunt March’s departure, Jo came softly downstairs, paused instant parlor door, hearing sound within, nodded smiled satisfied expression, saying herself, “She seen away planned, affair settled. I go hear fun, good laugh it.” But poor Jo never got laugh, transfixed upon threshold spectacle held there, staring mouth nearly wide open eyes. Going exult fallen enemy praise strong-minded sister banishment objectionable lover, certainly shock behold aforesaid enemy serenely sitting sofa, strongminded sister enthroned upon knee wearing expression abject submission. Jo gave sort gasp, cold shower bath suddenly fallen upon her, unexpected turning tables actually took breath away. At odd sound lovers turned saw her. Meg jumped up, looking proud shy, ‘that man’, Jo called him, actually laughed said coolly, kissed astonished newcomer, “Sister Jo, congratulate us!” That adding insult injury, altogether much, making wild demonstration hands, Jo vanished without word. Rushing upstairs, startled invalids exclaiming tragically burst room, “Oh, somebody go quick! John Brooke acting dreadfully, Meg likes it!” Mr. Mrs. March left room speed, casting upon bed, Jo cried scolded tempestuously told awful news Beth Amy. The little girls, however, considered agreeable interesting event, Jo got little comfort them, went refuge garret, confided troubles rats. Nobody ever knew went parlor afternoon, great deal talking done, quiet Mr. Brooke astonished friends eloquence spirit pleaded suit, told plans, persuaded arrange everything wanted it. The tea bell rang finished describing paradise meant earn Meg, proudly took supper, looking happy Jo heart jealous dismal. Amy much impressed John’s devotion Meg’s dignity, Beth beamed distance, Mr. Mrs. March surveyed young couple tender satisfaction perfectly evident Aunt March right calling ‘unworldly pair babies’. No one ate much, everyone looked happy, old room seemed brighten amazingly first romance family began there. “You cannot say nothing pleasant ever happens now, you, Meg?” said Amy, trying decide would group lovers sketch planning make. “No, I sure I cannot. How much happened since I said that! It seems year ago,” answered Meg, blissful dream lifted far common things bread butter. “The joys come close upon sorrows time, I rather think changes begun,” said Mrs. March. “In families comes, then, year full events. This one, ends well, all.” “Hope next end better,” muttered Jo, found hard see Meg absorbed stranger face, Jo loved persons dearly dreaded affection lost lessened way. “I hope third year end better. I mean shall, I live work plans,” said Mr. Brooke, smiling Meg, everything become possible now. “Does seem long wait?” asked Amy, hurry wedding. “I got much learn I shall ready, seems short time me,” answered Meg, sweet gravity face never seen before. “You wait, I work,” said John beginning labors picking Meg’s napkin, expression caused Jo shake head, say air relief front door banged, “Here comes Laurie. Now shall sensible conversation.” But Jo mistaken, Laurie came prancing in, overflowing good spirits, bearing great bridal-looking bouquet ‘Mrs. John Brooke’, evidently laboring delusion whole affair brought excellent management. “I knew Brooke would way, always does, makes mind accomplish anything, done though sky falls,” said Laurie, presented offering congratulations. “Much obliged recommendation. I take good omen future invite wedding spot,” answered Mr. Brooke, felt peace mankind, even mischievous pupil. “I come I ends earth, sight Jo’s face alone occasion would worth long journey. You look festive, madam, matter?” asked Laurie, following corner parlor, whither adjourned greet Mr. Laurence. “I approve match, I made mind bear it, shall say word it,” said Jo solemnly. “You cannot know hard give Meg,” continued little quiver voice. “You give up. You go halves,” said Laurie consolingly. “It never again. I lost dearest friend,” sighed Jo. “You got me, anyhow. I good much, I know, I stand you, Jo, days life. Upon word I will!” Laurie meant said. “I know will, I ever much obliged. You always great comfort me, Teddy,” returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands. “Well, now, dismal, good fellow. It right see. Meg happy, Brooke fly round get settled immediately, Grandpa attend him, jolly see Meg little house. We capital times gone, I shall college long, go abroad nice trip other. Would console you?” “I rather think would, knowing may happen three years,” said Jo thoughtfully. “That true. Do wish could take look forward see shall then? I do,” returned Laurie. “I think not, I might see something sad, everyone looks happy now, I believe could much improved.” And Jo’s eyes went slowly round room, brightening looked, prospect pleasant one. Father Mother sat together, quietly reliving first chapter romance began twenty years ago. Amy drawing lovers, sat apart beautiful world own, light touched faces grace little artist could copy. Beth lay sofa, talking cheerily old friend, held little hand felt possessed power lead along peaceful way walked. Jo lounged favorite low seat, grave quiet look best became her, Laurie, leaning back chair, chin level curly head, smiled friendliest aspect, nodded long glass reflected both. So curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy. Whether ever rises again, depends upon reception given first act domestic drama called _Little Women_. PART 2 In order may start afresh go Meg’s wedding... CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR GOSSIP In order may start afresh go Meg’s wedding free minds, well begin little gossip Marches. And let premise elders think much ‘lovering’ story, I fear may (I afraid young folks make objection), I say Mrs. March, “What expect I four gay girls house, dashing young neighbor way?” The three years passed brought changes quiet family. The war over, Mr. March safely home, busy books small parish found minister nature grace, quiet, studious man, rich wisdom better learning, charity calls mankind ‘brother’, piety blossoms character, making august lovely. These attributes, spite poverty strict integrity shut worldly successes, attracted many admirable persons, naturally sweet herbs draw bees, naturally gave honey fifty years hard experience distilled bitter drop. Earnest young men found gray-headed scholar young heart they; thoughtful troubled women instinctively brought doubts him, sure finding gentlest sympathy, wisest counsel. Sinners told sins pure-hearted old man rebuked saved. Gifted men found companion him. Ambitious men caught glimpses nobler ambitions own, even worldlings confessed beliefs beautiful true, although ‘they would pay’. To outsiders five energetic women seemed rule house, many things, quiet scholar, sitting among books, still head family, household conscience, anchor, comforter, busy, anxious women always turned troublous times, finding him, truest sense sacred words, husband father. The girls gave hearts mother’s keeping, souls father’s, parents, lived labored faithfully them, gave love grew growth bound tenderly together sweetest tie blesses life outlives death. Mrs. March brisk cheery, though rather grayer, saw last, absorbed Meg’s affairs hospitals homes still full wounded ‘boys’ soldiers’ widows, decidedly miss motherly missionary’s visits. John Brooke duty manfully year, got wounded, sent home, allowed return. He received stars bars, deserved them, cheerfully risked had, life love precious full bloom. Perfectly resigned discharge, devoted getting well, preparing business, earning home Meg. With good sense sturdy independence characterized him, refused Mr. Laurence’s generous offers, accepted place bookkeeper, feeling better satisfied begin honestly earned salary running risks borrowed money. Meg spent time working well waiting, growing womanly character, wise housewifely arts, prettier ever, love great beautifier. She girlish ambitions hopes, felt disappointment humble way new life must begin. Ned Moffat married Sallie Gardiner, Meg could help contrasting fine house carriage, many gifts, splendid outfit own, secretly wishing could same. But somehow envy discontent soon vanished thought patient love labor John put little home awaiting her, sat together twilight, talking small plans, future always grew beautiful bright forgot Sallie’s splendor felt richest, happiest girl Christendom. Jo never went back Aunt March, old lady took fancy Amy bribed offer drawing lessons one best teachers going, sake advantage, Amy would served far harder mistress. So gave mornings duty, afternoons pleasure, prospered finely. Jo meantime devoted literature Beth, remained delicate long fever thing past. Not invalid exactly, never rosy, healthy creature been, yet always hopeful, happy, serene, busy quiet duties loved, everyone friend, angel house, long loved learned know it. As long _The Spread Eagle_ paid dollar column ‘rubbish’, called it, Jo felt woman means, spun little romances diligently. But great plans fermented busy brain ambitious mind, old tin kitchen garret held slowly increasing pile blotted manuscript, one day place name March upon roll fame. Laurie, dutifully gone college please grandfather, getting easiest possible manner please himself. A universal favorite, thanks money, manners, much talent, kindest heart ever got owner scrapes trying get people them, stood great danger spoiled, probably would been, like many another promising boy, possessed talisman evil memory kind old man bound success, motherly friend watched son, last, least means, knowledge four innocent girls loved, admired, believed hearts. Being ‘a glorious human boy’, course frolicked flirted, grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, gymnastic, college fashions ordained, hazed hazed, talked slang, came perilously near suspension expulsion. But high spirits love fun causes pranks, always managed save frank confession, honorable atonement, irresistible power persuasion possessed perfection. In fact, rather prided narrow escapes, liked thrill girls graphic accounts triumphs wrathful tutors, dignified professors, vanquished enemies. The ‘men class’, heroes eyes girls, never wearied exploits ‘our fellows’, frequently allowed bask smiles great creatures, Laurie brought home him. Amy especially enjoyed high honor, became quite belle among them, ladyship early felt learned use gift fascination endowed. Meg much absorbed private particular John care lords creation, Beth shy peep wonder Amy dared order so, Jo felt quite element, found difficult refrain imitating gentlemanly attitudes, phrases, feats, seemed natural decorums prescribed young ladies. They liked Jo immensely, never fell love her, though escaped without paying tribute sentimental sigh two Amy’s shrine. And speaking sentiment brings us naturally ‘Dovecote’. That name little brown house Mr. Brooke prepared Meg’s first home. Laurie christened it, saying highly appropriate gentle lovers ‘went together like pair turtledoves, first bill coo’. It tiny house, little garden behind lawn big pocket handkerchief front. Here Meg meant fountain, shrubbery, profusion lovely flowers, though present fountain represented weather-beaten urn, like dilapidated slopbowl, shrubbery consisted several young larches, undecided whether live die, profusion flowers merely hinted regiments sticks show seeds planted. But inside, altogether charming, happy bride saw fault garret cellar. To sure, hall narrow fortunate piano, one never could got whole, dining room small six people tight fit, kitchen stairs seemed built express purpose precipitating servants china pell-mell coalbin. But get used slight blemishes nothing could complete, good sense good taste presided furnishing, result highly satisfactory. There marble-topped tables, long mirrors, lace curtains little parlor, simple furniture, plenty books, fine picture two, stand flowers bay window, and, scattered about, pretty gifts came friendly hands fairer loving messages brought. I think Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost beauty John put bracket stood upon, upholsterer could draped plain muslin curtains gracefully Amy’s artistic hand, store-room ever better provided good wishes, merry words, happy hopes Jo mother put away Meg’s boxes, barrels, bundles, I morally certain spandy new kitchen never could looked cozy neat Hannah arranged every pot pan dozen times over, laid fire ready lighting minute ‘Mis. Brooke came home’. I also doubt young matron ever began life rich supply dusters, holders, piece bags, Beth made enough last till silver wedding came round, invented three different kinds dishcloths express service bridal china. People hire things done never know lose, homeliest tasks get beautified loving hands them, Meg found many proofs everything small nest, kitchen roller silver vase parlor table, eloquent home love tender forethought. What happy times planning together, solemn shopping excursions, funny mistakes made, shouts laughter arose Laurie’s ridiculous bargains. In love jokes, young gentleman, though nearly college, much boy ever. His last whim bring weekly visits new, useful, ingenious article young housekeeper. Now bag remarkable clothespins, next, wonderful nutmeg grater fell pieces first trial, knife cleaner spoiled knives, sweeper picked nap neatly carpet left dirt, labor-saving soap took skin one’s hands, infallible cements stuck firmly nothing fingers deluded buyer, every kind tinware, toy savings bank odd pennies, wonderful boiler would wash articles steam every prospect exploding process. In vain Meg begged stop. John laughed him, Jo called ‘Mr. Toodles’. He possessed mania patronizing Yankee ingenuity, seeing friends fitly furnished forth. So week beheld fresh absurdity. Everything done last, even Amy’s arranging different colored soaps match different colored rooms, Beth’s setting table first meal. “Are satisfied? Does seem like home, feel happy here?” asked Mrs. March, daughter went new kingdom arm arm, seemed cling together tenderly ever. “Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks all, happy I cannot talk it,” look far better words. “If servant two would right,” said Amy, coming parlor, trying decide whether bronze Mercury looked best whatnot mantlepiece. “Mother I talked over, I made mind try way first. There little Lotty run errands help there, I shall enough work keep getting lazy homesick,” answered Meg tranquilly. “Sallie Moffat four,” began Amy. “If Meg four, house would hold them, master missis would camp garden,” broke Jo, who, enveloped big blue pinafore, giving last polish door handles. “Sallie poor man’s wife, many maids keeping fine establishment. Meg John begin humbly, I feeling quite much happiness little house big one. It great mistake young girls like Meg leave nothing dress, give orders, gossip. When I first married, I used long new clothes wear get torn, I might pleasure mending them, I got heartily sick fancywork tending pocket handkerchief.” “Why go kitchen make messes, Sallie says amuse herself, though never turn well servants laugh her,” said Meg. “I while, ‘mess’ learn Hannah things done, servants need laugh me. It play then, came time I truly grateful I possessed power cook wholesome food little girls, help I could longer afford hire help. You begin end, Meg, dear, lessons learn use by-and-by John richer man, mistress house, however splendid, know work ought done, wishes well honestly served.” “Yes, Mother, I sure that,” said Meg, listening respectfully little lecture, best women hold forth upon absorbing subject house keeping. “Do know I like room baby house,” added Meg, minute after, went upstairs looked well-stored linen closet. Beth there, laying snowy piles smoothly shelves exulting goodly array. All three laughed Meg spoke, linen closet joke. You see, said Meg married ‘that Brooke’ cent money, Aunt March rather quandary time appeased wrath made repent vow. She never broke word, much exercised mind get round it, last devised plan whereby could satisfy herself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence’s mamma, ordered buy, made, marked generous supply house table linen, send present, faithfully done, secret leaked out, greatly enjoyed family, Aunt March tried look utterly unconscious, insisted could give nothing old-fashioned pearls long promised first bride. “That housewifely taste I glad see. I young friend set housekeeping six sheets, finger bowls company satisfied her,” said Mrs. March, patting damask tablecloths, truly feminine appreciation fineness. “I single finger bowl, setout last days, Hannah says.” And Meg looked quite contented, well might. A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, cropped head, felt basin hat, flyaway coat, came tramping road great pace, walked low fence without stopping open gate, straight Mrs. March, hands hearty... “Here I am, Mother! Yes, right.” The last words answer look elder lady gave him, kindly questioning look handsome eyes met frankly little ceremony closed, usual, motherly kiss. “For Mrs. John Brooke, maker’s congratulations compliments. Bless you, Beth! What refreshing spectacle are, Jo. Amy, getting altogether handsome single lady.” As Laurie spoke, delivered brown paper parcel Meg, pulled Beth’s hair ribbon, stared Jo’s big pinafore, fell attitude mock rapture Amy, shook hands round, everyone began talk. “Where John?” asked Meg anxiously. “Stopped get license tomorrow, madam.” “Which side last match, Teddy?” inquired Jo, persisted feeling interest manly sports despite nineteen years. “Ours, course. Wish would see.” “How lovely Miss Randal?” asked Amy significant smile. “More cruel ever. Do see I pining away?” Laurie gave broad chest sounding slap heaved melodramatic sigh. “What last joke? Undo bundle see, Meg,” said Beth, eying knobby parcel curiosity. “It useful thing house case fire thieves,” observed Laurie, watchman’s rattle appeared, amid laughter girls. “Any time John away get frightened, Mrs. Meg, swing front window, rouse neighborhood jiffy. Nice thing, it?” Laurie gave sample powers made cover ears. “There gratitude you! And speaking gratitude reminds mention may thank Hannah saving wedding cake destruction. I saw going house I came by, defended manfully I would pick it, looked like remarkably plummy one.” “I wonder ever grow up, Laurie,” said Meg matronly tone. “I best, madam, cannot get much higher, I afraid, six feet men degenerate days,” responded young gentleman, whose head level little chandelier. “I suppose would profanation eat anything spick-and-span bower, I tremendously hungry, I propose adjournment,” added presently. “Mother I going wait John. There last things settle,” said Meg, bustling away. “Beth I going Kitty Bryant’s get flowers tomorrow,” added Amy, tying picturesque hat picturesque curls, enjoying effect much anybody. “Come, Jo, desert fellow. I state exhaustion I cannot get home without help. Do take apron, whatever do, peculiarly becoming,” said Laurie, Jo bestowed especial aversion capacious pocket offered arm support feeble steps. “Now, Teddy, I want talk seriously tomorrow,” began Jo, strolled away together. “You must promise behave well, cut pranks, spoil plans.” “Not prank.” “And say funny things ought sober.” “I never do. You one that.” “And I implore look ceremony. I shall certainly laugh do.” “You see me, crying hard thick fog round obscure prospect.” “I never cry unless great affliction.” “Such fellows going college, hey?” cut Laurie, suggestive laugh. “Do peacock. I moaned trifle keep girls company.” “Exactly. I say, Jo, Grandpa week? Pretty amiable?” “Very. Why, got scrape want know take it?” asked Jo rather sharply. “Now, Jo, think I would look mother face say ‘All right’, not?” Laurie stopped short, injured air. “No, I not.” “Then go suspicious. I want money,” said Laurie, walking again, appeased hearty tone. “You spend great deal, Teddy.” “Bless you, I spend it, spends somehow, gone I know it.” “You generous kind-hearted let people borrow, cannot say ‘No’ anyone. We heard Henshaw him. If always spent money way, one would blame you,” said Jo warmly. “Oh, made mountain molehill. You would let fine fellow work death want little help, worth dozen us lazy chaps, would you?” “Of course not, I see use seventeen waistcoats, endless neckties, new hat every time come home. I thought would got dandy period, every breaks new spot. Just fashion hideous, make head look like scrubbing brush, wear strait jacket, orange gloves, clumping square-toed boots. If cheap ugliness, I would say nothing, costs much other, I get satisfaction it.” Laurie threw back head, laughed heartily attack, felt hat fell off, Jo walked it, insult afforded opportunity expatiating advantages rough-and-ready costume, folded maltreated hat, stuffed pocket. “Do lecture more, good soul! I enough week, like enjoy I come home. I get regardless expense tomorrow satisfaction friends.” “I leave peace let hair grow. I aristocratic, I object seen person looks like young prize fighter,” observed Jo severely. “This unassuming style promotes study, adopt it,” returned Laurie, certainly could accused vanity, voluntarily sacrificed handsome curly crop demand quarter-inch-long stubble. “By way, Jo, I think little Parker really getting desperate Amy. He talks constantly, writes poetry, moons suspicious manner. He would better nip little passion bud, he?” added Laurie, confidential, elder brotherly tone, minute’s silence. “Of course had. We want marrying family years come. Mercy us, children thinking of?” Jo looked much scandalized Amy little Parker yet teens. “It fast age, I know coming to, madam. You mere infant, go next, Jo, left lamenting,” said Laurie, shaking head degeneracy times. “Do alarmed. I one agreeable sort. Nobody want me, mercy, always one old maid family.” “You give anyone chance,” said Laurie, sidelong glance little color sunburned face. “You show soft side character, fellow gets peep accident cannot help showing likes it, treat Mrs. Gummidge sweetheart, throw cold water him, get thorny one dares touch look you.” “I like sort thing. I busy worried nonsense, I think dreadful break families so. Now say it. Meg’s wedding turned heads, talk nothing lovers absurdities. I wish get cross, let us change subject;” Jo looked quite ready fling cold water slightest provocation. Whatever feelings might been, Laurie found vent long low whistle fearful prediction parted gate, “Mark words, Jo, go next.” CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE THE FIRST WEDDING The June roses porch awake bright early morning, rejoicing hearts cloudless sunshine, like friendly little neighbors, were. Quite flushed excitement ruddy faces, swung wind, whispering one another seen, peeped dining room windows feast spread, climbed nod smile sisters dressed bride, others waved welcome came went various errands garden, porch, hall, all, rosiest full-blown flower palest baby bud, offered tribute beauty fragrance gentle mistress loved tended long. Meg looked like rose herself, best sweetest heart soul seemed bloom face day, making fair tender, charm beautiful beauty. Neither silk, lace, orange flowers would have. “I want fashionable wedding, I love, I wish look familiar self.” So made wedding gown herself, sewing tender hopes innocent romances girlish heart. Her sisters braided pretty hair, ornaments wore lilies valley, ‘her John’ liked best flowers grew. “You look like dear Meg, sweet lovely I hug would crumple dress,” cried Amy, surveying delight done. “Then I satisfied. But please hug kiss me, everyone, mind dress. I want great many crumples sort put today,” Meg opened arms sisters, clung April faces minute, feeling new love changed old. “Now I going tie John’s cravat him, stay minutes Father quietly study,” Meg ran perform little ceremonies, follow mother wherever went, conscious spite smiles motherly face, secret sorrow hid motherly heart flight first bird nest. As younger girls stand together, giving last touches simple toilet, may good time tell changes three years wrought appearance, looking best now. Jo’s angles much softened, learned carry ease, grace. The curly crop lengthened thick coil, becoming small head atop tall figure. There fresh color brown cheeks, soft shine eyes, gentle words fall sharp tongue today. Beth grown slender, pale, quiet ever. The beautiful, kind eyes larger, lies expression saddens one, although sad itself. It shadow pain touches young face pathetic patience, Beth seldom complains always speaks hopefully ‘being better soon’. Amy truth considered ‘the flower family’, sixteen air bearing full-grown woman, beautiful, possessed indescribable charm called grace. One saw lines figure, make motion hands, flow dress, droop hair, unconscious yet harmonious, attractive many beauty itself. Amy’s nose still afflicted her, never would grow Grecian, mouth, wide, decided chin. These offending features gave character whole face, never could see it, consoled wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, curls golden abundant ever. All three wore suits thin silver gray (their best gowns summer), blush roses hair bosom, three looked were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing moment busy lives read wistful eyes sweetest chapter romance womanhood. There ceremonious performances, everything natural homelike possible, Aunt March arrived, scandalized see bride come running welcome lead in, find bridegroom fastening garland fallen down, catch glimpse paternal minister marching upstairs grave countenance wine bottle arm. “Upon word, state things!” cried old lady, taking seat honor prepared her, settling folds lavender moire great rustle. “You ought seen till last minute, child.” “I show, Aunty, one coming stare me, criticize dress, count cost luncheon. I happy care anyone says thinks, I going little wedding I like it. John, dear, hammer.” And away went Meg help ‘that man’ highly improper employment. Mr. Brooke even say, “Thank you,” stooped unromantic tool, kissed little bride behind folding door, look made Aunt March whisk pocket handkerchief sudden dew sharp old eyes. A crash, cry, laugh Laurie, accompanied indecorous exclamation, “Jupiter Ammon! Jo’s upset cake again!” caused momentary flurry, hardly flock cousins arrived, ‘the party came in’, Beth used say child. “Do let young giant come near me, worries worse mosquitoes,” whispered old lady Amy, rooms filled Laurie’s black head towered rest. “He promised good today, perfectly elegant likes,” returned Amy, gliding away warn Hercules beware dragon, warning caused haunt old lady devotion nearly distracted her. There bridal procession, sudden silence fell upon room Mr. March young couple took places green arch. Mother sisters gathered close, loath give Meg up. The fatherly voice broke once, seemed make service beautiful solemn. The bridegroom’s hand trembled visibly, one heard replies. But Meg looked straight husband’s eyes, said, “I will!” tender trust face voice mother’s heart rejoiced Aunt March sniffed audibly. Jo cry, though near once, saved demonstration consciousness Laurie staring fixedly her, comical mixture merriment emotion wicked black eyes. Beth kept face hidden mother’s shoulder, Amy stood like graceful statue, becoming ray sunshine touching white forehead flower hair. It thing, I afraid, minute fairly married, Meg cried, “The first kiss Marmee!” turning, gave heart lips. During next fifteen minutes looked like rose ever, everyone availed privileges fullest extent, Mr. Laurence old Hannah, who, adorned headdress fearfully wonderfully made, fell upon hall, crying sob chuckle, “Bless you, deary, hundred times! The cake hurt mite, everything looks lovely.” Everybody cleared that, said something brilliant, tried to, well, laughter ready hearts light. There display gifts, already little house, elaborate breakfast, plentiful lunch cake fruit, dressed flowers. Mr. Laurence Aunt March shrugged smiled one another water, lemonade, coffee found sorts nectar three Hebes carried round. No one said anything, till Laurie, insisted serving bride, appeared her, loaded salver hand puzzled expression face. “Has Jo smashed bottles accident?” whispered, “or I merely laboring delusion I saw lying loose morning?” “No, grandfather kindly offered us best, Aunt March actually sent some, Father put away little Beth, dispatched rest Soldier’s Home. You know thinks wine used illness, Mother says neither daughters ever offer young man roof.” Meg spoke seriously expected see Laurie frown laugh, neither, quick look her, said, impetuous way, “I like that! For I seen enough harm done wish women would think do.” “You made wise experience, I hope?” anxious accent Meg’s voice. “No. I give word it. Do think well me, either, one temptations. Being brought wine common water almost harmless, I care it, pretty girl offers it, one like refuse, see.” “But will, sake others, own. Come, Laurie, promise, give one reason call happiest day life.” A demand sudden serious made young man hesitate moment, ridicule often harder bear self-denial. Meg knew gave promise would keep costs, feeling power, used woman may friend’s good. She speak, looked face made eloquent happiness, smile said, “No one refuse anything today.” Laurie certainly could not, answering smile, gave hand, saying heartily, “I promise, Mrs. Brooke!” “I thank you, very, much.” “And I drink ‘long life resolution’, Teddy,” cried Jo, baptizing splash lemonade, waved glass beamed approvingly upon him. So toast drunk, pledge made loyally kept spite many temptations, instinctive wisdom, girls seized happy moment friend service, thanked life. After lunch, people strolled about, twos threes, house garden, enjoying sunshine without within. Meg John happened standing together middle grass plot, Laurie seized inspiration put finishing touch unfashionable wedding. “All married people take hands dance round new-made husband wife, Germans do, bachelors spinsters prance couples outside!” cried Laurie, promenading path Amy, infectious spirit skill everyone else followed example without murmur. Mr. Mrs. March, Aunt Uncle Carrol began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, moment’s hesitation, threw train arm whisked Ned ring. But crowning joke Mr. Laurence Aunt March, stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly old lady, tucked cane arm, hopped briskly away join hands rest dance bridal pair, young folks pervaded garden like butterflies midsummer day. Want breath brought impromptu ball close, people began go. “I wish well, dear, I heartily wish well, I think sorry it,” said Aunt March Meg, adding bridegroom, led carriage, “You got treasure, young man, see deserve it.” “That prettiest wedding I age, Ned, I see why, bit style it,” observed Mrs. Moffat husband, drove away. “Laurie, lad, ever want indulge sort thing, get one little girls help you, I shall perfectly satisfied,” said Mr. Laurence, settling easy chair rest excitement morning. “I best gratify you, Sir,” Laurie’s unusually dutiful reply, carefully unpinned posy Jo put buttonhole. The little house far away, bridal journey Meg quiet walk John old home new. When came down, looking like pretty Quakeress dove-colored suit straw bonnet tied white, gathered say ‘good-by’, tenderly going make grand tour. “Do feel I separated you, Marmee dear, I love less loving John much,” said, clinging mother, full eyes moment. “I shall come every day, Father, expect keep old place hearts, though I married. Beth going great deal, girls drop laugh housekeeping struggles. Thank happy wedding day. Good-by, good-by!” They stood watching her, faces full love hope tender pride walked away, leaning husband’s arm, hands full flowers June sunshine brightening happy face—and Meg’s married life began. CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX ARTISTIC ATTEMPTS It takes people long time learn difference talent genius, especially ambitious young men women. Amy learning distinction much tribulation, mistaking enthusiasm inspiration, attempted every branch art youthful audacity. For long time lull ‘mud-pie’ business, devoted finest pen-and-ink drawing, showed taste skill graceful handiwork proved pleasant profitable. But over-strained eyes caused pen ink laid aside bold attempt poker-sketching. While attack lasted, family lived constant fear conflagration, odor burning wood pervaded house hours, smoke issued attic would alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay promiscuously, Hannah never went bed without pail water dinner bell door case fire. Raphael’s face found boldly executed underside moulding board, Bacchus head beer barrel. A chanting cherub adorned cover sugar bucket, attempts portray Romeo Juliet supplied kindling time. From fire oil natural transition burned fingers, Amy fell painting undiminished ardor. An artist friend fitted castoff palettes, brushes, colors, daubed away, producing pastoral marine views never seen land sea. Her monstrosities way cattle would taken prizes agricultural fair, perilous pitching vessels would produced seasickness nautical observer, utter disregard known rules shipbuilding rigging convulsed laughter first glance. Swarthy boys dark-eyed Madonnas, staring one corner studio, suggested Murillo; oily brown shadows faces lurid streak wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies dropiscal infants, Rubens; Turner appeared tempests blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain, purple clouds, tomato-colored splash middle, might sun bouy, sailor’s shirt king’s robe, spectator pleased. Charcoal portraits came next, entire family hung row, looking wild crocky evoked coalbin. Softened crayon sketches, better, likenesses good, Amy’s hair, Jo’s nose, Meg’s mouth, Laurie’s eyes pronounced ‘wonderfully fine’. A return clay plaster followed, ghostly casts acquaintances haunted corners house, tumbled closet shelves onto people’s heads. Children enticed models, till incoherent accounts mysterious doings caused Miss Amy regarded light young ogress. Her efforts line, however, brought abrupt close untoward accident, quenched ardor. Other models failing time, undertook cast pretty foot, family one day alarmed unearthly bumping screaming running rescue, found young enthusiast hopping wildly would foot held fast pan full plaster, hardened unexpected rapidity. With much difficulty danger dug out, Jo overcome laughter excavated knife went far, cut poor foot, left lasting memorial one artistic attempt, least. After Amy subsided, till mania sketching nature set haunting river, field, wood, picturesque studies, sighing ruins copy. She caught endless colds sitting damp grass book ‘a delicious bit’, composed stone, stump, one mushroom, broken mullein stalk, ‘a heavenly mass clouds’, looked like choice display featherbeds done. She sacrificed complexion floating river midsummer sun study light shade, got wrinkle nose trying ‘points sight’, whatever squint-and-string performance called. If ‘genius eternal patience’, Michelangelo affirms, Amy claim divine attribute, persevered spite obstacles, failures, discouragements, firmly believing time something worthy called ‘high art’. She learning, doing, enjoying things, meanwhile, resolved attractive accomplished woman, even never became great artist. Here succeeded better, one happily created beings please without effort, make friends everywhere, take life gracefully easily less fortunate souls tempted believe born lucky star. Everybody liked her, among good gifts tact. She instinctive sense pleasing proper, always said right thing right person, suited time place, self-possessed sisters used say, “If Amy went court without rehearsal beforehand, would know exactly do.” One weaknesses desire move ‘our best society’, without quite sure best really was. Money, position, fashionable accomplishments, elegant manners desirable things eyes, liked associate possessed them, often mistaking false true, admiring admirable. Never forgetting birth gentlewoman, cultivated aristocratic tastes feelings, opportunity came might ready take place poverty excluded her. “My lady,” friends called her, sincerely desired genuine lady, heart, yet learn money cannot buy refinement nature, rank always confer nobility, true breeding makes felt spite external drawbacks. “I want ask favor you, Mamma,” Amy said, coming important air one day. “Well, little girl, it?” replied mother, whose eyes stately young lady still remained ‘the baby’. “Our drawing class breaks next week, girls separate summer, I want ask day. They wild see river, sketch broken bridge, copy things admire book. They kind many ways, I grateful, rich I know I poor, yet never made difference.” “Why they?” Mrs. March put question girls called ‘Maria Theresa air’. “You know well I make difference nearly everyone, ruffle like dear, motherly hen, chickens get pecked smarter birds. The ugly duckling turned swan, know.” Amy smiled without bitterness, possessed happy temper hopeful spirit. Mrs. March laughed, smoothed maternal pride asked, “Well, swan, plan?” “I like ask girls lunch next week, take drive places want see, row river, perhaps, make little artistic fete them.” “That looks feasible. What want lunch? Cake, sandwiches, fruit, coffee necessary, I suppose?” “Oh, dear, no! We must cold tongue chicken, French chocolate ice cream, besides. The girls used things, I want lunch proper elegant, though I work living.” “How many young ladies there?” asked mother, beginning look sober. “Twelve fourteen class, I dare say come.” “Bless me, child, charter omnibus carry about.” “Why, Mother, think thing? Not six eight probably come, I shall hire beach wagon borrow Mr. Laurence’s cherry-bounce.” (Hannah’s pronunciation char-a-banc.) “All expensive, Amy.” “Not very. I calculated cost, I pay myself.” “Do think, dear, girls used things, best nothing new, simpler plan would pleasanter them, change nothing more, much better us buying borrowing need, attempting style keeping circumstances?” “If I cannot I like, I care all. I know I carry perfectly well, girls help little, I see I cannot I willing pay it,” said Amy, decision opposition apt change obstinacy. Mrs. March knew experience excellent teacher, possible left children learn alone lessons would gladly made easier, objected taking advice much salts senna. “Very well, Amy, heart set upon it, see way without great outlay money, time, temper, I say more. Talk girls, whichever way decide, I best help you.” “Thanks, Mother, always kind.” away went Amy lay plan sisters. Meg agreed once, promised aid, gladly offering anything possessed, little house best saltspoons. But Jo frowned upon whole project would nothing first. “Why world spend money, worry family, turn house upside parcel girls care sixpence you? I thought much pride sense truckle mortal woman wears French boots rides coupe,” said Jo, who, called tragic climax novel, best mood social enterprises. “I truckle, I hate patronized much do!” returned Amy indignantly, two still jangled questions arose. “The girls care me, I them, great deal kindness sense talent among them, spite call fashionable nonsense. You care make people like you, go good society, cultivate manners tastes. I do, I mean make every chance comes. You go world elbows nose air, call independence, like. That way.” When Amy whetted tongue freed mind usually got best it, seldom failed common sense side, Jo carried love liberty hate conventionalities unlimited extent naturally found worsted argument. Amy’s definition Jo’s idea independence good hit burst laughing, discussion took amiable turn. Much will, Jo length consented sacrifice day Mrs. Grundy, help sister regarded ‘a nonsensical business’. The invitations sent, nearly accepted, following Monday set apart grand event. Hannah humor week’s work deranged, prophesied “ef washin’ ironin’ warn’t done reg’lar, nothing would go well anywheres”. This hitch mainspring domestic machinery bad effect upon whole concern, Amy’s motto ‘Nil desperandum’, made mind do, proceeded spite obstacles. To begin with, Hannah’s cooking turn well. The chicken tough, tongue salty, chocolate would froth properly. Then cake ice cost Amy expected, wagon, various expenses, seemed trifling outset, counted rather alarmingly afterward. Beth got cold took bed. Meg unusual number callers keep home, Jo divided state mind breakages, accidents, mistakes uncommonly numerous, serious, trying. If fair Monday, young ladies come Tuesday, arrangement aggravated Jo Hannah last degree. On Monday morning weather undecided state exasperating steady pour. It drizzled little, shone little, blew little, make mind till late anyone else make theirs. Amy dawn, hustling people beds breakfasts, house might got order. The parlor struck looking uncommonly shabby, without stopping sigh not, skillfully made best had, arranging chairs worn places carpet, covering stains walls homemade statuary, gave artistic air room, lovely vases flowers Jo scattered about. The lunch looked charming, surveyed it, sincerely hoped would taste well, borrowed glass, china, silver would get safely home again. The carriages promised, Meg Mother ready honors, Beth able help Hannah behind scenes, Jo engaged lively amiable absent mind, aching head, decided disapproval everybody everything would allow, wearily dressed, Amy cheered anticipations happy moment when, lunch safely over, drive away friends afternoon artistic delights, ‘cherry bounce’ broken bridge strong points. Then came hours suspense, vibrated parlor porch, public opinion varied like weathercock. A smart shower eleven evidently quenched enthusiasm young ladies arrive twelve, nobody came, two exhausted family sat blaze sunshine consume perishable portions feast, nothing might lost. “No doubt weather today, certainly come, must fly round ready them,” said Amy, sun woke next morning. She spoke briskly, secret soul wished said nothing Tuesday, interest like cake getting little stale. “I cannot get lobsters, without salad today,” said Mr. March, coming half hour later, expression placid despair. “Use chicken then, toughness matter salad,” advised wife. “Hannah left kitchen table minute, kittens got it. I sorry, Amy,” added Beth, still patroness cats. “Then I must lobster, tongue alone do,” said Amy decidedly. “Shall I rush town demand one?” asked Jo, magnanimity martyr. “You would come bringing home arm without paper, try me. I go myself,” answered Amy, whose temper beginning fail. Shrouded thick veil armed genteel traveling basket, departed, feeling cool drive would soothe ruffled spirit fit labors day. After delay, object desire procured, likewise bottle dressing prevent loss time home, drove again, well pleased forethought. As omnibus contained one passenger, sleepy old lady, Amy pocketed veil beguiled tedium way trying find money gone to. So busy card full refractory figures observe newcomer, entered without stopping vehicle, till masculine voice said, “Good morning, Miss March,” and, looking up, beheld one Laurie’s elegant college friends. Fervently hoping would get did, Amy utterly ignored basket feet, congratulating new traveling dress, returned young man’s greeting usual suavity spirit. They got excellently, Amy’s chief care soon set rest learning gentleman would leave first, chatting away peculiarly lofty strain, old lady got out. In stumbling door, upset basket, and—oh horror!—the lobster, vulgar size brilliancy, revealed highborn eyes Tudor! “By Jove, forgotten dinner!” cried unconscious youth, poking scarlet monster place cane, preparing hand basket old lady. “Please not—it is—it mine,” murmured Amy, face nearly red fish. “Oh, really, I beg pardon. It uncommonly fine one, it?” said Tudor, great presence mind, air sober interest credit breeding. Amy recovered breath, set basket boldly seat, said, laughing, “Do wish salad going make, see charming young ladies eat it?” Now tact, two ruling foibles masculine mind touched. The lobster instantly surrounded halo pleasing reminiscences, curiosity ‘the charming young ladies’ diverted mind comical mishap. “I suppose laugh joke Laurie, I shall see them, comfort,” thought Amy, Tudor bowed departed. She mention meeting home (though discovered that, thanks upset, new dress much damaged rivulets dressing meandered skirt), went preparations seemed irksome before, twelve clock ready again. Feeling neighbors interested movements, wished efface memory yesterday’s failure grand success today, ordered ‘cherry bounce’, drove away state meet escort guests banquet. “There rumble, coming! I go onto porch meet them. It looks hospitable, I want poor child good time trouble,” said Mrs. March, suiting action word. But one glance, retired, indescribable expression, looking quite lost big carriage, sat Amy one young lady. “Run, Beth, help Hannah clear half things table. It absurd put luncheon twelve single girl,” cried Jo, hurrying away lower regions, excited stop even laugh. In came Amy, quite calm delightfully cordial one guest kept promise. The rest family, dramatic turn, played parts equally well, Miss Eliott found hilarious set, impossible control entirely merriment possessed them. The remodeled lunch gaily partaken of, studio garden visited, art discussed enthusiasm, Amy ordered buggy (alas elegant cherry-bounce), drove friend quietly neighborhood till sunset, ‘the party went out’. As came walking in, looking tired composed ever, observed every vestige unfortunate fete disappeared, except suspicious pucker corners Jo’s mouth. “You loverly afternoon drive, dear,” said mother, respectfully whole twelve come. “Miss Eliott sweet girl, seemed enjoy herself, I thought,” observed Beth, unusual warmth. “Could spare cake? I really need some, I much company, I cannot make delicious stuff yours,” asked Meg soberly. “Take all. I one likes sweet things, mold I dispose it,” answered Amy, thinking sigh generous store laid end this. “It pity Laurie help us,” began Jo, sat ice cream salad second time two days. A warning look mother checked remarks, whole family ate heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed, “salad one favorite dishes ancients, Evelyn...” Here general explosion laughter cut short ‘history salads’, great surprise learned gentleman. “Bundle everything basket send Hummels. Germans like messes. I sick sight this, reason die surfeit I fool,” cried Amy, wiping eyes. “I thought I died I saw two girls rattling what-you-call-it, like two little kernels big nutshell, Mother waiting state receive throng,” sighed Jo, quite spent laughter. “I sorry disappointed, dear, best satisfy you,” said Mrs. March, tone full motherly regret. “I satisfied. I done I undertook, fault failed. I comfort that,” said Amy little quiver voice. “I thank much helping me, I thank still allude month, least.” No one several months, word ‘fete’ always produced general smile, Laurie’s birthday gift Amy tiny coral lobster shape charm watch guard. CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN LITERARY LESSONS Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, dropped good luck penny path. Not golden penny, exactly, I doubt half million would given real happiness little sum came wise. Every weeks would shut room, put scribbling suit, ‘fall vortex’, expressed it, writing away novel heart soul, till finished could find peace. Her ‘scribbling suit’ consisted black woolen pinafore could wipe pen will, cap material, adorned cheerful red bow, bundled hair decks cleared action. This cap beacon inquiring eyes family, periods kept distance, merely popping heads semi-occasionally ask, interest, “Does genius burn, Jo?” They always venture even ask question, took observation cap, judged accordingly. If expressive article dress drawn low upon forehead, sign hard work going on, exciting moments pushed rakishly askew, despair seized author plucked wholly off, cast upon floor. At times intruder silently withdrew, red bow seen gaily erect upon gifted brow, anyone dare address Jo. She think genius means, writing fit came on, gave entire abandon, led blissful life, unconscious want, care, bad weather, sat safe happy imaginary world, full friends almost real dear flesh. Sleep forsook eyes, meals stood untasted, day night short enjoy happiness blessed times, made hours worth living, even bore fruit. The divine afflatus usually lasted week two, emerged ‘vortex’, hungry, sleepy, cross, despondent. She recovering one attacks prevailed upon escort Miss Crocker lecture, return virtue rewarded new idea. It People’s Course, lecture Pyramids, Jo rather wondered choice subject audience, took granted great social evil would remedied great want supplied unfolding glories Pharaohs audience whose thoughts busy price coal flour, whose lives spent trying solve harder riddles Sphinx. They early, Miss Crocker set heel stocking, Jo amused examining faces people occupied seat them. On left two matrons, massive foreheads bonnets match, discussing Women’s Rights making tatting. Beyond sat pair humble lovers, artlessly holding hand, somber spinster eating peppermints paper bag, old gentleman taking preparatory nap behind yellow bandanna. On right, neighbor studious looking lad absorbed newspaper. It pictorial sheet, Jo examined work art nearest her, idly wondering fortuitous concatenation circumstances needed melodramatic illustration Indian full war costume, tumbling precipice wolf throat, two infuriated young gentlemen, unnaturally small feet big eyes, stabbing close by, disheveled female flying away background mouth wide open. Pausing turn page, lad saw looking and, boyish good nature offered half paper, saying bluntly, “want read it? That first-rate story.” Jo accepted smile, never outgrown liking lads, soon found involved usual labyrinth love, mystery, murder, story belonged class light literature passions holiday, author’s invention fails, grand catastrophe clears stage one half dramatis personae, leaving half exult downfall. “Prime, it?” asked boy, eye went last paragraph portion. “I think I could well tried,” returned Jo, amused admiration trash. “I think I pretty lucky chap I could. She makes good living stories, say.” pointed name Mrs. S.L.A.N.G. Northbury, title tale. “Do know her?” asked Jo, sudden interest. “No, I read pieces, I know fellow works office paper printed.” “Do say makes good living stories like this?” Jo looked respectfully agitated group thickly sprinkled exclamation points adorned page. “Guess does! She knows folks like, gets paid well writing it.” Here lecture began, Jo heard little it, Professor Sands prosing away Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, hieroglyphics, covertly taking address paper, boldly resolving try hundred-dollar prize offered columns sensational story. By time lecture ended audience awoke, built splendid fortune (not first founded paper), already deep concoction story, unable decide whether duel come elopement murder. She said nothing plan home, fell work next day, much disquiet mother, always looked little anxious ‘genius took burning’. Jo never tried style before, contenting mild romances _The Spread Eagle_. Her experience miscellaneous reading service now, gave idea dramatic effect, supplied plot, language, costumes. Her story full desperation despair limited acquaintance uncomfortable emotions enabled make it, located Lisbon, wound earthquake, striking appropriate denouement. The manuscript privately dispatched, accompanied note, modestly saying tale get prize, writer hardly dared expect, would glad receive sum might considered worth. Six weeks long time wait, still longer time girl keep secret, Jo both, beginning give hope ever seeing manuscript again, letter arrived almost took breath away, opening it, check hundred dollars fell lap. For minute stared snake, read letter began cry. If amiable gentleman wrote kindly note could known intense happiness giving fellow creature, I think would devote leisure hours, any, amusement, Jo valued letter money, encouraging, years effort pleasant find learned something, though write sensation story. A prouder young woman seldom seen she, when, composed herself, electrified family appearing letter one hand, check other, announcing prize. Of course great jubilee, story came everyone read praised it, though father told language good, romance fresh hearty, tragedy quite thrilling, shook head, said unworldly way... “You better this, Jo. Aim highest, never mind money.” “I think money best part it. What fortune?” asked Amy, regarding magic slip paper reverential eye. “Send Beth Mother seaside month two,” answered Jo promptly. To seaside went, much discussion, though Beth come home plump rosy could desired, much better, Mrs. March declared felt ten years younger. So Jo satisfied investment prize money, fell work cheery spirit, bent earning delightful checks. She earn several year, began feel power house, magic pen, ‘rubbish’ turned comforts all. The Duke’s Daughter paid butcher’s bill, A Phantom Hand put new carpet, Curse Coventrys proved blessing Marches way groceries gowns. Wealth certainly desirable thing, poverty sunny side, one sweet uses adversity genuine satisfaction comes hearty work head hand, inspiration necessity, owe half wise, beautiful, useful blessings world. Jo enjoyed taste satisfaction, ceased envy richer girls, taking great comfort knowledge could supply wants, need ask one penny. Little notice taken stories, found market, encouraged fact, resolved make bold stroke fame fortune. Having copied novel fourth time, read confidential friends, submitted fear trembling three publishers, last disposed it, condition would cut one third, omit parts particularly admired. “Now I must either bundle back tin kitchen mold, pay printing myself, chop suit purchasers get I it. Fame good thing house, cash convenient, I wish take sense meeting important subject,” said Jo, calling family council. “Do spoil book, girl, know, idea well worked out. Let wait ripen,” father’s advice, practiced preached, waited patiently thirty years fruit ripen, haste gather even sweet mellow. “It seems Jo profit taking trial waiting,” said Mrs. March. “Criticism best test work, show unsuspected merits faults, help better next time. We partial, praise blame outsiders prove useful, even gets little money.” “Yes,” said Jo, knitting brows, “that it. I fussing thing long, I really know whether good, bad, indifferent. It great help cool, impartial persons take look it, tell think it.” “I would leave word it. You spoil do, interest story minds actions people, muddle explain go on,” said Meg, firmly believed book remarkable novel ever written. “But Mr. Allen says, ‘Leave explanations, make brief dramatic, let characters tell story’,” interrupted Jo, turning publisher’s note. “Do tells you. He knows sell, not. Make good, popular book, get much money can. By-and-by, got name, afford digress, philosophical metaphysical people novels,” said Amy, took strictly practical view subject. “Well,” said Jo, laughing, “if people ‘philosophical metaphysical’, fault, I know nothing things, except I hear father say, sometimes. If I got wise ideas jumbled romance, much better me. Now, Beth, say?” “I like see printed soon,” Beth said, smiled saying it. But unconscious emphasis last word, wistful look eyes never lost childlike candor, chilled Jo’s heart minute forboding fear, decided make little venture ‘soon’. So, Spartan firmness, young authoress laid first-born table, chopped ruthlessly ogre. In hope pleasing everyone, took everyone advice, like old man donkey fable suited nobody. Her father liked metaphysical streak unconsciously got it, allowed remain though doubts it. Her mother thought trifle much description. Out, therefore came, many necessary links story. Meg admired tragedy, Jo piled agony suit her, Amy objected fun, and, best intentions life, Jo quenched spritly scenes relieved somber character story. Then, complicate ruin, cut one third, confidingly sent poor little romance, like picked robin, big, busy world try fate. Well, printed, got three hundred dollars it, likewise plenty praise blame, much greater expected thrown state bewilderment took time recover. “You said, Mother, criticism would help me. But it, contradictory I know whether I written promising book broken ten commandments?” cried poor Jo, turning heap notices, perusal filled pride joy one minute, wrath dismay next. “This man says, ‘An exquisite book, full truth, beauty, earnestness.’ ‘All sweet, pure, healthy.’” continued perplexed authoress. “The next, ‘The theory book bad, full morbid fancies, spiritualistic ideas, unnatural characters.’ Now, I theory kind, believe Spiritualism, copied characters life, I see critic right. Another says, ‘It one best American novels appeared years.’ (I know better that), next asserts ‘Though original, written great force feeling, dangerous book.’ ’Tisn’t! Some make fun it, overpraise, nearly insist I deep theory expound, I wrote pleasure money. I wish I would printed whole all, I hate misjudged.” Her family friends administered comfort commendation liberally. Yet hard time sensitive, high-spirited Jo, meant well apparently done ill. But good, whose opinion real value gave criticism author’s best education, first soreness over, could laugh poor little book, yet believe still, feel wiser stronger buffeting received. “Not genius, like Keats, kill me,” said stoutly, “and I got joke side, all, parts taken straight real life denounced impossible absurd, scenes I made silly head pronounced ‘charmingly natural, tender, true’. So I comfort that, I ready, I take another.” CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT DOMESTIC EXPERIENCES Like young matrons, Meg began married life determination model housekeeper. John find home paradise, always see smiling face, fare sumptuously every day, never know loss button. She brought much love, energy, cheerfulness work could succeed, spite obstacles. Her paradise tranquil one, little woman fussed, over-anxious please, bustled like true Martha, cumbered many cares. She tired, sometimes, even smile, John grew dyspeptic course dainty dishes ungratefully demanded plain fare. As buttons, soon learned wonder went, shake head carelessness men, threaten make sew himself, see work would stand impatient clumsy fingers better hers. They happy, even discovered could live love alone. John find Meg’s beauty diminished, though beamed behind familiar coffee pot. Nor Meg miss romance daily parting, husband followed kiss tender inquiry, “Shall I send veal mutton dinner, darling?” The little house ceased glorified bower, became home, young couple soon felt change better. At first played keep-house, frolicked like children. Then John took steadily business, feeling cares head family upon shoulders, Meg laid cambric wrappers, put big apron, fell work, said, energy discretion. While cooking mania lasted went Mrs. Cornelius’s Receipt Book mathematical exercise, working problems patience care. Sometimes family invited help eat bounteous feast successes, Lotty would privately dispatched batch failures, concealed eyes convenient stomachs little Hummels. An evening John account books usually produced temporary lull culinary enthusiasm, frugal fit would ensue, poor man put course bread pudding, hash, warmed-over coffee, tried soul, although bore praiseworthy fortitude. Before golden mean found, however, Meg added domestic possessions young couples seldom get long without, family jar. Fired housewifely wish see storeroom stocked homemade preserves, undertook put currant jelly. John requested order home dozen little pots extra quantity sugar, currants ripe attended once. As John firmly believed ‘my wife’ equal anything, took natural pride skill, resolved gratified, crop fruit laid pleasing form winter use. Home came four dozen delightful little pots, half barrel sugar, small boy pick currants her. With pretty hair tucked little cap, arms bared elbow, checked apron coquettish look spite bib, young housewife fell work, feeling doubts success, seen Hannah hundreds times? The array pots rather amazed first, John fond jelly, nice little jars would look well top shelf, Meg resolved fill all, spent long day picking, boiling, straining, fussing jelly. She best, asked advice Mrs. Cornelius, racked brain remember Hannah left undone, reboiled, resugared, restrained, dreadful stuff would ‘jell’. She longed run home, bib all, ask Mother lend hand, John agreed would never annoy anyone private worries, experiments, quarrels. They laughed last word idea suggested preposterous one, held resolve, whenever could get without help so, one interfered, Mrs. March advised plan. So Meg wrestled alone refractory sweetmeats hot summer day, five clock sat topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung bedaubed hands, lifted voice wept. Now, first flush new life, often said, “My husband shall always feel free bring friend home whenever likes. I shall always prepared. There shall flurry, scolding, discomfort, neat house, cheerful wife, good dinner. John, dear, never stop ask leave, invite please, sure welcome me.” How charming was, sure! John quite glowed pride hear say it, felt blessed thing superior wife. But, although company time time, never happened unexpected, Meg never opportunity distinguish till now. It always happens vale tears, inevitability things wonder at, deplore, bear best can. If John forgotten jelly, really would unpardonable choose day, days year, bring friend home dinner unexpectedly. Congratulating handsome repast ordered morning, feeling sure would ready minute, indulging pleasant anticipations charming effect would produce, pretty wife came running meet him, escorted friend mansion, irrepressible satisfaction young host husband. It world disappointments, John discovered reached Dovecote. The front door usually stood hospitably open. Now shut, locked, yesterday’s mud still adorned steps. The parlor windows closed curtained, picture pretty wife sewing piazza, white, distracting little bow hair, bright-eyed hostess, smiling shy welcome greeted guest. Nothing sort, soul appeared sanginary-looking boy asleep current bushes. “I afraid something happened. Step garden, Scott, I look Mrs. Brooke,” said John, alarmed silence solitude. Round house hurried, led pungent smell burned sugar, Mr. Scott strolled him, queer look face. He paused discreetly distance Brooke disappeared, could see hear, bachelor, enjoyed prospect mightily. In kitchen reigned confusion despair. One edition jelly trickled pot pot, another lay upon floor, third burning gaily stove. Lotty, Teutonic phlegm, calmly eating bread currant wine, jelly still hopelessly liquid state, Mrs. Brooke, apron head, sat sobbing dismally. “My dearest girl, matter?” cried John, rushing in, awful visions scalded hands, sudden news affliction, secret consternation thought guest garden. “Oh, John, I tired hot cross worried! I till I worn out. Do come help I shall die!” exhausted housewife cast upon breast, giving sweet welcome every sense word, pinafore baptized time floor. “What worries dear? Has anything dreadful happened?” asked anxious John, tenderly kissing crown little cap, askew. “Yes,” sobbed Meg despairingly. “Tell quick, then. Do cry. I bear anything better that. Out it, love.” “The... The jelly jell I know do!” John Brooke laughed never dared laugh afterward, derisive Scott smiled involuntarily heard hearty peal, put finishing stroke poor Meg’s woe. “Is all? Fling window, bother it. I buy quarts want it, heaven’s sake hysterics, I brought Jack Scott home dinner, and...” John got further, Meg cast off, clasped hands tragic gesture fell chair, exclaiming tone mingled indignation, reproach, dismay... “A man dinner, everything mess! John Brooke, could thing?” “Hush, garden! I forgot confounded jelly, cannot helped now,” said John, surveying prospect anxious eye. “You ought sent word, told morning, ought remembered busy I was,” continued Meg petulantly, even turtledoves peck ruffled. “I know morning, time send word, I met way out. I never thought asking leave, always told I liked. I never tried before, hang I ever again!” added John, aggrieved air. “I hope not! Take away once. I cannot see him, dinner.” “Well, I like that! Where beef vegetables I sent home, pudding promised?” cried John, rushing larder. “I time cook anything. I meant dine Mother’s. I sorry, I busy,” Meg’s tears began again. John mild man, human, long day’s work come home tired, hungry, hopeful, find chaotic house, empty table, cross wife exactly conducive repose mind manner. He restrained however, little squall would blown over, one unlucky word. “It scrape, I acknowledge, lend hand, pull good time yet. Do cry, dear, exert bit, fix us something eat. We hungry hunters, shall mind is. Give us cold meat, bread cheese. We ask jelly.” He meant good-natured joke, one word sealed fate. Meg thought cruel hint sad failure, last atom patience vanished spoke. “You must get scrape can. I used ‘exert’ anyone. It like man propose bone vulgar bread cheese company. I anything sort house. Take Scott Mother’s, tell I away, sick, dead, anything. I see him, two laugh jelly much like. You anything else here.” delivered defiance one breath, Meg cast away pinafore precipitately left field bemoan room. What two creatures absence, never knew, Mr. Scott taken ‘up Mother’s’, Meg descended, strolled away together, found traces promiscuous lunch filled horror. Lotty reported eaten “a much, greatly laughed, master bid throw away sweet stuff, hide pots.” Meg longed go tell Mother, sense shame short-comings, loyalty John, “who might cruel, nobody know it,” restrained her, summary cleaning up, dressed prettily, sat wait John come forgiven. Unfortunately, John come, seeing matter light. He carried good joke Scott, excused little wife well could, played host hospitably friend enjoyed impromptu dinner, promised come again, John angry, though show it, felt Meg deserted hour need. “It fair tell man bring folks home time, perfect freedom, took word, flame blame him, leave lurch, laughed pitied. No, George, not! And Meg must know it.” He fumed inwardly feast, flurry strolled home seeing Scott off, milder mood came him. “Poor little thing! It hard upon tried heartily please me. She wrong, course, young. I must patient teach her.” He hoped gone home—he hated gossip interference. For minute ruffled mere thought it, fear Meg would cry sick softened heart, sent quicker pace, resolving calm kind, firm, quite firm, show failed duty spouse. Meg likewise resolved ‘calm kind, firm’, show duty. She longed run meet him, beg pardon, kissed comforted, sure being, but, course, nothing sort, saw John coming, began hum quite naturally, rocked sewed, like lady leisure best parlor. John little disappointed find tender Niobe, feeling dignity demanded first apology, made none, came leisurely laid upon sofa singularly relevant remark, “We going new moon, dear.” “I objection,” Meg’s equally soothing remark. A topics general interest introduced Mr. Brooke wet-blanketed Mrs. Brooke, conversation languished. John went one window, unfolded paper, wrapped it, figuratively speaking. Meg went window, sewed new rosettes slippers among necessaries life. Neither spoke. Both looked quite ‘calm firm’, felt desperately uncomfortable. “Oh, dear,” thought Meg, “married life trying, need infinite patience well love, Mother says.” The word ‘Mother’ suggested maternal counsels given long ago, received unbelieving protests. “John good man, faults, must learn see bear them, remembering own. He decided, never obstinate, reason kindly, oppose impatiently. He accurate, particular truth—a good trait, though call ‘fussy’. Never deceive look word, Meg, give confidence deserve, support need. He temper, like ours—one flash over—but white, still anger seldom stirred, kindled hard quench. Be careful, careful, wake anger yourself, peace happiness depend keeping respect. Watch yourself, first ask pardon err, guard little piques, misunderstandings, hasty words often pave way bitter sorrow regret.” These words came back Meg, sat sewing sunset, especially last. This first serious disagreement, hasty speeches sounded silly unkind, recalled them, anger looked childish now, thoughts poor John coming home scene quite melted heart. She glanced tears eyes, see them. She put work got up, thinking, “I first say, ‘Forgive me’”, seem hear her. She went slowly across room, pride hard swallow, stood him, turn head. For minute felt really could it, came thought, “This beginning. I part, nothing reproach with,” stooping down, softly kissed husband forehead. Of course settled it. The penitent kiss better world words, John knee minute, saying tenderly... “It bad laugh poor little jelly pots. Forgive me, dear. I never again!” But did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds times, Meg, declaring sweetest jelly ever made, family peace preserved little family jar. After this, Meg Mr. Scott dinner special invitation, served pleasant feast without cooked wife first course, occasion gay gracious, made everything go charmingly, Mr. Scott told John lucky fellow, shook head hardships bachelorhood way home. In autumn, new trials experiences came Meg. Sallie Moffat renewed friendship, always running dish gossip little house, inviting ‘that poor dear’ come spend day big house. It pleasant, dull weather Meg often felt lonely. All busy home, John absent till night, nothing sew, read, potter about. So naturally fell Meg got way gadding gossiping friend. Seeing Sallie’s pretty things made long such, pity got them. Sallie kind, often offered coveted trifles, Meg declined them, knowing John would like it, foolish little woman went John disliked even worse. She knew husband’s income, loved feel trusted her, happiness, men seem value more—his money. She knew was, free take liked, asked keep account every penny, pay bills month, remember poor man’s wife. Till done well, prudent exact, kept little account books neatly, showed monthly without fear. But autumn serpent got Meg’s paradise, tempted like many modern Eve, apples, dress. Meg like pitied made feel poor. It irritated her, ashamed confess it, tried console buying something pretty, Sallie need think economize. She always felt wicked it, pretty things seldom necessaries, cost little, worth worrying about, trifles increased unconsciously, shopping excursions longer passive looker-on. But trifles cost one would imagine, cast accounts end month sum total rather scared her. John busy month left bills her, next month absent, third grand quarterly settling up, Meg never forgot it. A days done dreadful thing, weighed upon conscience. Sallie buying silks, Meg longed new one, handsome light one parties, black silk common, thin things evening wear proper girls. Aunt March usually gave sisters present twenty-five dollars apiece New Year’s. That month wait, lovely violet silk going bargain, money, dared take it. John always said hers, would think right spend prospective five-and-twenty, another five-and-twenty household fund? That question. Sallie urged it, offered lend money, best intentions life tempted Meg beyond strength. In evil moment shopman held lovely, shimmering folds, said, “A bargain, I assure, you, madam.” She answered, “I take it,” cut paid for, Sallie exulted, laughed thing consequence, driven away, feeling stolen something, police her. When got home, tried assuage pangs remorse spreading forth lovely silk, looked less silvery now, become her, all, words ‘fifty dollars’ seemed stamped like pattern breadth. She put away, haunted her, delightfully new dress should, dreadfully like ghost folly easily laid. When John got books night, Meg’s heart sank, first time married life, afraid husband. The kind, brown eyes looked could stern, though unusually merry, fancied found out, mean let know it. The house bills paid, books order. John praised her, undoing old pocketbook called ‘bank’, Meg, knowing quite empty, stopped hand, saying nervously... “You seen private expense book yet.” John never asked see it, always insisted so, used enjoy masculine amazement queer things women wanted, made guess piping was, demand fiercely meaning hug-me-tight, wonder little thing composed three rosebuds, bit velvet, pair strings, could possibly bonnet, cost six dollars. That night looked would like fun quizzing figures pretending horrified extravagance, often did, particularly proud prudent wife. The little book brought slowly laid him. Meg got behind chair pretense smoothing wrinkles tired forehead, standing there, said, panic increasing every word... “John, dear, I ashamed show book, I really dreadfully extravagant lately. I go much I must things, know, Sallie advised getting it, I did, New Year’s money partly pay it, I sorry I done it, I knew would think wrong me.” John laughed, drew round beside him, saying goodhumoredly, “Do go hide. I beat got pair killing boots. I rather proud wife’s feet, mind pay eight nine dollars boots, good ones.” That one last ‘trifles’, John’s eye fallen spoke. “Oh, say comes awful fifty dollars!” thought Meg, shiver. “It worse boots, silk dress,” said, calmness desperation, wanted worst over. “Well, dear, ‘dem’d total’, Mr. Mantalini says?” That sound like John, knew looking straightforward look always ready meet answer one frank till now. She turned page head time, pointing sum would bad enough without fifty, appalling added. For minute room still, John said slowly—but could feel cost effort express displeasure—. . . “Well, I know fifty much dress, furbelows notions finish days.” “It made trimmed,” sighed Meg, faintly, sudden recollection cost still incurred quite overwhelmed her. “Twenty-five yards silk seems good deal cover one small woman, I doubt wife look fine Ned Moffat’s gets on,” said John dryly. “I know angry, John, I cannot help it. I mean waste money, I think little things would count so. I cannot resist I see Sallie buying wants, pitying I not. I try contented, hard, I tired poor.” The last words spoken low thought hear them, did, wounded deeply, denied many pleasures Meg’s sake. She could bitten tongue minute said it, John pushed books away got up, saying little quiver voice, “I afraid this. I best, Meg.” If scolded her, even shaken her, would broken heart like words. She ran held close, crying, repentant tears, “Oh, John, dear, kind, hard-working boy. I mean it! It wicked, untrue ungrateful, could I say it! Oh, could I say it!” He kind, forgave readily, utter one reproach, Meg knew done said thing would forgotten soon, although might never allude again. She promised love better worse, she, wife, reproached poverty, spending earnings recklessly. It dreadful, worst John went quietly afterward, nothing happened, except stayed town later, worked night gone cry sleep. A week remorse nearly made Meg sick, discovery John countermanded order new greatcoat reduced state despair pathetic behold. He simply said, answer surprised inquiries change, “I cannot afford it, dear.” Meg said more, minutes found hall face buried old greatcoat, crying heart would break. They long talk night, Meg learned love husband better poverty, seemed made man him, given strength courage fight way, taught tender patience bear comfort natural longings failures loved. Next day put pride pocket, went Sallie, told truth, asked buy silk favor. The good-natured Mrs. Moffat willingly so, delicacy make present immediately afterward. Then Meg ordered home greatcoat, John arrived, put on, asked liked new silk gown. One imagine answer made, received present, blissful state things ensued. John came home early, Meg gadded more, greatcoat put morning happy husband, taken night devoted little wife. So year rolled round, midsummer came Meg new experience, deepest tenderest woman’s life. Laurie came sneaking kitchen Dovecote one Saturday, excited face, received clash cymbals, Hannah clapped hands saucepan one cover other. “How little mamma? Where everybody? Why tell I came home?” began Laurie loud whisper. “Happy queen, dear! Every soul upstairs worshipin’. We want hurrycanes round. Now go parlor, I send you,” somewhat involved reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically. Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing flannel bundle laid forth upon large pillow. Jo’s face sober, eyes twinkled, odd sound voice repressed emotion sort. “Shut eyes hold arms,” said invitingly. Laurie backed precipitately corner, put hands behind imploring gesture. “No, thank you. I would rather not. I shall drop smash it, sure fate.” “Then shall see nevvy,” said Jo decidedly, turning go. “I will, I will! Only must responsible damages.” obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut eyes something put arms. A peal laughter Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah, John caused open next minute, find invested two babies instead one. No wonder laughed, expression face droll enough convulse Quaker, stood stared wildly unconscious innocents hilarious spectators dismay Jo sat floor screamed. “Twins, Jupiter!” said minute, turning women appealing look comically piteous, added, “Take quick, somebody! I going laugh, I shall drop them.” Jo rescued babies, marched down, one arm, already initiated mysteries babytending, Laurie laughed till tears ran cheeks. “It best joke season, it? I would told you, I set heart surprising you, I flatter I done it,” said Jo, got breath. “I never staggered life. Is fun? Are boys? What going name them? Let us another look. Hold up, Jo, upon life one many me,” returned Laurie, regarding infants air big, benevolent Newfoundland looking pair infantile kittens. “Boy girl. Are beauties?” said proud papa, beaming upon little red squirmers unfledged angels. “Most remarkable children I ever saw. Which which?” Laurie bent like well-sweep examine prodigies. “Amy put blue ribbon boy pink girl, French fashion, always tell. Besides, one blue eyes one brown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,” said wicked Jo. “I afraid might like it,” began Laurie, unusual timidity matters. “Of course will, used now. Do minute, sir!” commanded Jo, fearing might propose proxy. Laurie screwed face obeyed gingerly peck little cheek produced another laugh, made babies squeal. “There, I knew like it! That boy, see kick, hits fists like good one. Now then, young Brooke, pitch man size, you?” cried Laurie, delighted poke face tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about. “He named John Laurence, girl Margaret, mother grandmother. We shall call Daisey, two Megs, I suppose mannie Jack, unless find better name,” said Amy, aunt-like interest. “Name Demijohn, call Demi short,” said Laurie. “Daisy Demi, thing! I knew Teddy would it,” cried Jo clapping hands. Teddy certainly done time, babies ‘Daisy’ ‘Demi’ end chapter. CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE CALLS “Come, Jo, time.” “For what?” “You mean say forgotten promised make half dozen calls today?” “I done good many rash foolish things life, I think I ever mad enough say I would make six calls one day, single one upsets week.” “Yes, did, bargain us. I finish crayon Beth you, go properly me, return neighbors’ visits.” “If fair, bond, I stand letter bond, Shylock. There pile clouds east, fair, I go.” “Now, shirking. It lovely day, prospect rain, pride keeping promises, honorable, come duty, peace another six months.” At minute Jo particularly absorbed dressmaking, mantua-maker general family, took especial credit could use needle well pen. It provoking arrested act first trying-on, ordered make calls best array warm July day. She hated calls formal sort, never made till Amy compelled bargain, bribe, promise. In present instance escape, clashed scissors rebelliously, protesting smelled thunder, gave in, put away work, taking hat gloves air resignation, told Amy victim ready. “Jo March, perverse enough provoke saint! You intend make calls state, I hope,” cried Amy, surveying amazement. “Why not? I neat cool comfortable, quite proper dusty walk warm day. If people care clothes me, I wish see them. You dress both, elegant please. It pays fine. It me, furbelows worry me.” “Oh, dear!” sighed Amy, “now contrary fit, drive distracted I get properly ready. I sure pleasure go today, debt owe society, one pay me. I anything you, Jo, dress nicely, come help civil. You talk well, look aristocratic best things, behave beautifully, try, I proud you. I afraid go alone, come take care me.” “You artful little puss flatter wheedle cross old sister way. The idea aristocratic well-bred, afraid go anywhere alone! I know absurd. Well, I go I must, best. You shall commander expedition, I obey blindly, satisfy you?” said Jo, sudden change perversity lamblike submission. “You perfect cherub! Now put best things, I tell behave place, make good impression. I want people like you, would would try little agreeable. Do hair pretty way, put pink rose bonnet. It becoming, look sober plain suit. Take light gloves embroidered handkerchief. We stop Meg’s, borrow white sunshade, dove-colored one.” While Amy dressed, issued orders, Jo obeyed them, without entering protest, however, sighed rustled new organdie, frowned darkly tied bonnet strings irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously pins put collar, wrinkled features generally shook handkerchief, whose embroidery irritating nose present mission feelings, squeezed hands tight gloves three buttons tassel, last touch elegance, turned Amy imbecile expression countenance, saying meekly... “I perfectly miserable, consider presentable, I die happy.” “You highly satisfactory. Turn slowly round, let get careful view.” Jo revolved, Amy gave touch there, fell back, head one side, observing graciously, “Yes, do. Your head I could ask, white bonnet rose quite ravishing. Hold back shoulders, carry hands easily, matter gloves pinch. There one thing well, Jo, is, wear shawl. I cannot, nice see you, I glad Aunt March gave lovely one. It simple, handsome, folds arm really artistic. Is point mantle middle, I looped dress evenly? I like show boots, feet pretty, though nose not.” “You thing beauty joy forever,” said Jo, looking hand air connoisseur blue feather golden hair. “Am I drag best dress dust, loop up, please, madam?” “Hold walk, drop house. The sweeping style suits best, must learn trail skirts gracefully. You half buttoned one cuff, once. You never look finished careful little details, make pleasing whole.” Jo sighed, proceeded burst buttons glove, cuff, last ready, sailed away, looking ‘pretty picters’, Hannah said, hung upper window watch them. “Now, Jo dear, Chesters consider elegant people, I want put best deportment. Do make abrupt remarks, anything odd, you? Just calm, cool, quiet, safe ladylike, easily fifteen minutes,” said Amy, approached first place, borrowed white parasol inspected Meg, baby arm. “Let see. ‘Calm, cool, quiet’, yes, I think I promise that. I played part prim young lady stage, I try off. My powers great, shall see, easy mind, child.” Amy looked relieved, naughty Jo took word, first call sat every limb gracefully composed, every fold correctly draped, calm summer sea, cool snowbank, silent sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded ‘charming novel’, Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, opera, fashions. Each answered smile, bow, demure “Yes” “No” chill on. In vain Amy telegraphed word ‘talk’, tried draw out, administered covert pokes foot. Jo sat blandly unconscious all, deportment like Maud’s face, ‘icily regular, splendidly null’. “What haughty, uninteresting creature oldest Miss March is!” unfortunately audible remark one ladies, door closed upon guests. Jo laughed noiselessly hall, Amy looked disgusted failure instructions, naturally laid blame upon Jo. “How could mistake so? I merely meant properly dignified composed, made perfect stock stone. Try sociable Lambs’. Gossip girls do, interested dress flirtations whatever nonsense comes up. They move best society, valuable persons us know, I would fail make good impression anything.” “I agreeable. I gossip giggle, horrors raptures trifle like. I rather enjoy this, I imitate called ‘a charming girl’. I it, I May Chester model, I improve upon her. See Lambs say, ‘What lively, nice creature Jo March is!” Amy felt anxious, well might, Jo turned freakish knowing would stop. Amy’s face study saw sister skim next drawing room, kiss young ladies effusion, beam graciously upon young gentlemen, join chat spirit amazed beholder. Amy taken possession Mrs. Lamb, favorite, forced hear long account Lucretia’s last attack, three delightful young gentlemen hovered near, waiting pause might rush rescue her. So situated, powerless check Jo, seemed possessed spirit mischief, talked away volubly lady. A knot heads gathered her, Amy strained ears hear going on, broken sentences filled curiosity, frequent peals laughter made wild share fun. One may imagine suffering overhearing fragments sort conversation. “She rides splendidly. Who taught her?” “No one. She used practice mounting, holding reins, sitting straight old saddle tree. Now rides anything, know fear is, stableman let us horses cheap trains carry ladies well. She passion it, I often tell everything else fails, horsebreaker, get living so.” At awful speech Amy contained difficulty, impression given rather fast young lady, especial aversion. But could do? For old lady middle story, long done, Jo again, making droll revelations committing still fearful blunders. “Yes, Amy despair day, good beasts gone, three left, one lame, one blind, balky put dirt mouth would start. Nice animal pleasure party, it?” “Which choose?” asked one laughing gentlemen, enjoyed subject. “None them. She heard young horse farm house river, though lady never ridden him, resolved try, handsome spirited. Her struggles really pathetic. There one bring horse saddle, took saddle horse. My dear creature, actually rowed river, put head, marched barn utter amazement old man!” “Did ride horse?” “Of course did, capital time. I expected see brought home fragments, managed perfectly, life party.” “Well, I call plucky!” young Mr. Lamb turned approving glance upon Amy, wondering mother could saying make girl look red uncomfortable. She still redder uncomfortable moment after, sudden turn conversation introduced subject dress. One young ladies asked Jo got pretty drab hat wore picnic stupid Jo, instead mentioning place bought two years ago, must needs answer unnecessary frankness, “Oh, Amy painted it. You cannot buy soft shades, paint color like. It great comfort artistic sister.” “Is original idea?” cried Miss Lamb, found Jo great fun. “That nothing compared brilliant performances. There nothing child cannot do. Why, wanted pair blue boots Sallie’s party, painted soiled white ones loveliest shade sky blue ever saw, looked exactly like satin,” added Jo, air pride sister’s accomplishments exasperated Amy till felt would relief throw cardcase her. “We read story day, enjoyed much,” observed elder Miss Lamb, wishing compliment literary lady, look character then, must confessed. Any mention ‘works’ always bad effect upon Jo, either grew rigid looked offended, changed subject brusque remark, now. “Sorry could find nothing better read. I write rubbish sells, ordinary people like it. Are going New York winter?” As Miss Lamb ‘enjoyed’ story, speech exactly grateful complimentary. The minute made Jo saw mistake, fearing make matter worse, suddenly remembered make first move toward departure, abruptness left three people half-finished sentences mouths. “Amy, must go. Good-by, dear, come see us. We pining visit. I dare ask you, Mr. Lamb, come, I think I shall heart send away.” Jo said droll imitation May Chester’s gushing style Amy got room rapidly possible, feeling strong desire laugh cry time. “Did I well?” asked Jo, satisfied air walked away. “Nothing could worse,” Amy’s crushing reply. “What possessed tell stories saddle, hats boots, rest it?” “Why, funny, amuses people. They know poor, use pretending grooms, buy three four hats season, things easy fine do.” “You need go tell little shifts, expose poverty perfectly unnecessary way. You bit proper pride, never learn hold tongue speak,” said Amy despairingly. Poor Jo looked abashed, silently chafed end nose stiff handkerchief, performing penance misdemeanors. “How shall I behave here?” asked, approached third mansion. “Just please. I wash hands you,” Amy’s short answer. “Then I enjoy myself. The boys home, comfortable time. Goodness knows I need little change, elegance bad effect upon constitution,” returned Jo gruffly, disturbed failure suit. An enthusiastic welcome three big boys several pretty children speedily soothed ruffled feelings, leaving Amy entertain hostess Mr. Tudor, happened calling likewise, Jo devoted young folks found change refreshing. She listened college stories deep interest, caressed pointers poodles without murmur, agreed heartily “Tom Brown brick,” regardless improper form praise, one lad proposed visit turtle tank, went alacrity caused Mamma smile upon her, motherly lady settled cap left ruinous condition filial hugs, bearlike affectionate, dearer faultless coiffure hands inspired Frenchwoman. Leaving sister devices, Amy proceeded enjoy heart’s content. Mr. Tudor’s uncle married English lady third cousin living lord, Amy regarded whole family great respect, spite American birth breeding, possessed reverence titles haunts best us—that unacknowledged loyalty early faith kings set democratic nation sun ferment coming royal yellow-haired laddie, years ago, still something love young country bears old, like big son imperious little mother, held could, let go farewell scolding rebelled. But even satisfaction talking distant connection British nobility render Amy forgetful time, proper number minutes passed, reluctantly tore aristocratic society, looked Jo, fervently hoping incorrigible sister would found position bring disgrace upon name March. It might worse, Amy considered bad. For Jo sat grass, encampment boys her, dirty-footed dog reposing skirt state festival dress, related one Laurie’s pranks admiring audience. One small child poking turtles Amy’s cherished parasol, second eating gingerbread Jo’s best bonnet, third playing ball gloves, enjoying themselves, Jo collected damaged property go, escort accompanied her, begging come again, “It fun hear Laurie’s larks.” “Capital boys, they? I feel quite young brisk that.” said Jo, strolling along hands behind her, partly habit, partly conceal bespattered parasol. “Why always avoid Mr. Tudor?” asked Amy, wisely refraining comment upon Jo’s dilapidated appearance. “Do like him, puts airs, snubs sisters, worries father, speak respectfully mother. Laurie says fast, I consider desirable acquaintance, I let alone.” “You might treat civilly, least. You gave cool nod, bowed smiled politest way Tommy Chamberlain, whose father keeps grocery store. If reversed nod bow, would right,” said Amy reprovingly. “No, would not,” returned Jo, “I neither like, respect, admire Tudor, though grandfather’s uncle’s nephew’s niece third cousin lord. Tommy poor bashful good clever. I think well him, like show I do, gentleman spite brown paper parcels.” “It use trying argue you,” began Amy. “Not least, dear,” interrupted Jo, “so let us look amiable, drop card here, Kings evidently out, I deeply grateful.” The family cardcase done duty girls walked on, Jo uttered another thanksgiving reaching fifth house, told young ladies engaged. “Now let us go home, never mind Aunt March today. We run time, really pity trail dust best bibs tuckers, tired cross.” “Speak yourself, please. Aunt March likes us pay compliment coming style, making formal call. It little thing do, gives pleasure, I believe hurt things half much letting dirty dogs clumping boys spoil them. Stoop down, let take crumbs bonnet.” “What good girl are, Amy!” said Jo, repentant glance damaged costume sister, fresh spotless still. “I wish easy little things please people you. I think them, takes much time them, I wait chance confer great favor, let small ones slip, tell best end, I fancy.” Amy smiled mollified once, saying maternal air, “Women learn agreeable, particularly poor ones, way repaying kindnesses receive. If would remember that, practice it, would better liked I am, you.” “I crotchety old thing, always shall be, I willing right, easier risk life person pleasant I feel like it. It great misfortune strong likes dislikes, it?” “It greater able hide them. I mind saying I approve Tudor do, I called upon tell so. Neither you, use making disagreeable is.” “But I think girls ought show disapprove young men, except manners? Preaching good, I know sorrow, since I Teddie manage. But many little ways I influence without word, I say ought others can.” “Teddy remarkable boy, cannot taken sample boys,” said Amy, tone solemn conviction, would convulsed ‘remarkable boy’ heard it. “If belles, women wealth position, might something, perhaps, us frown one set young gentlemen approve them, smile upon another set do, would particle effect, considered odd puritanical.” “So countenance things people detest, merely belles millionaires, we? That nice sort morality.” “I cannot argue it, I know way world, people set get laughed pains. I like reformers, I hope never try one.” “I like them, I shall one I can, spite laughing world would never get without them. We cannot agree that, belong old set, I new. You get best, I shall liveliest time it. I rather enjoy brickbats hooting, I think.” “Well, compose now, worry Aunt new ideas.” “I try to, I always possessed burst particularly blunt speech revolutionary sentiment her. It doom, I cannot help it.” They found Aunt Carrol old lady, absorbed interesting subject, dropped girls came in, conscious look betrayed talking nieces. Jo good humor, perverse fit returned, Amy, virtuously done duty, kept temper pleased everybody, angelic frame mind. This amiable spirit felt once, aunts ‘my deared’ affectionately, looking afterward said emphatically, “That child improves every day.” “Are going help fair, dear?” asked Mrs. Carrol, Amy sat beside confiding air elderly people like well young. “Yes, Aunt. Mrs. Chester asked I would, I offered tend table, I nothing time give.” “I not,” put Jo decidedly. “I hate patronized, Chesters think great favor allow us help highly connected fair. I wonder consented, Amy, want work.” “I willing work. It freedmen well Chesters, I think kind let share labor fun. Patronage trouble well meant.” “Quite right proper. I like grateful spirit, dear. It pleasure help people appreciate efforts. Some not, trying,” observed Aunt March, looking spectacles Jo, sat apart, rocking herself, somewhat morose expression. If Jo known great happiness wavering balance one them, would turned dove-like minute, unfortunately, windows breasts, cannot see goes minds friends. Better us cannot general thing, would comfort, saving time temper. By next speech, Jo deprived several years pleasure, received timely lesson art holding tongue. “I like favors, oppress make feel like slave. I would rather everything myself, perfectly independent.” “Ahem!” coughed Aunt Carrol softly, look Aunt March. “I told so,” said Aunt March, decided nod Aunt Carrol. Mercifully unconscious done, Jo sat nose air, revolutionary aspect anything inviting. “Do speak French, dear?” asked Mrs. Carrol, laying hand Amy’s. “Pretty well, thanks Aunt March, let us Esther talk often I like,” replied Amy, grateful look, caused old lady smile affably. “How languages?” asked Mrs. Carrol Jo. “Do know word. I stupid studying anything, cannot bear French, slippery, silly sort language,” brusque reply. Another look passed ladies, Aunt March said Amy, “You quite strong well now, dear, I believe? Eyes trouble more, they?” “Not all, thank you, madam. I well, mean great things next winter, I may ready Rome, whenever joyful time arrives.” “Good girl! You deserve go, I sure day,” said Aunt March, approving pat head, Amy picked ball her. Crosspatch, draw latch, Sit fire spin, squalled Polly, bending perch back chair peep Jo’s face, comical air impertinent inquiry impossible help laughing. “Most observing bird,” said old lady. “Come take walk, dear?” cried Polly, hopping toward china closet, look suggestive lump sugar. “Thank you, I will. Come Amy.” Jo brought visit end, feeling strongly ever calls bad effect upon constitution. She shook hands gentlemanly manner, Amy kissed aunts, girls departed, leaving behind impression shadow sunshine, impression caused Aunt March say, vanished... “You would better it, Mary. I supply money.” Aunt Carrol reply decidedly, “I certainly will, father mother consent.” CHAPTER THIRTY CONSEQUENCES Mrs. Chester’s fair elegant select considered great honor young ladies neighborhood invited take table, everyone much interested matter. Amy asked, Jo not, fortunate parties, elbows decidedly akimbo period life, took good many hard knocks teach get easily. The ‘haughty, uninteresting creature’ let severely alone, Amy’s talent taste duly complimented offer art table, exerted prepare secure appropriate valuable contributions it. Everything went smoothly till day fair opened, occurred one little skirmishes almost impossible avoid, five-and-twenty women, old young, private piques prejudices, try work together. May Chester rather jealous Amy latter greater favorite herself, time several trifling circumstances occurred increase feeling. Amy’s dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May’s painted vases—that one thorn. Then conquering Tudor danced four times Amy late party May—that thorn number two. But chief grievance rankled soul, gave excuse unfriendly conduct, rumor obliging gossip whispered her, March girls made fun Lambs’. All blame fallen upon Jo, naughty imitation lifelike escape detection, frolicsome Lambs permitted joke escape. No hint reached culprits, however, Amy’s dismay imagined, when, evening fair, putting last touches pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, course, resented supposed ridicule daughter, said, bland tone, cold look... “I find, dear, feeling among young ladies giving table anyone girls. As prominent, say attractive table all, chief getters-up fair, thought best take place. I sorry, I know sincerely interested mind little personal disappointment, shall another table like.” Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand would easy deliver little speech, time came, found rather difficult utter naturally, Amy’s unsuspicious eyes looking straight full surprise trouble. Amy felt something behind this, could guess what, said quietly, feeling hurt, showing did, “Perhaps rather I took table all?” “Now, dear, ill feeling, I beg. It merely matter expediency, see, girls naturally take lead, table considered proper place. I think appropriate you, feel grateful efforts make pretty, must give private wishes, course, I see good place elsewhere. Would like flower table? The little girls undertook it, discouraged. You could make charming thing it, flower table always attractive know.” “Especially gentlemen,” added May, look enlightened Amy one sudden fall favor. She colored angrily, took notice girlish sarcasm, answered unexpected amiability... “It shall please, Mrs. Chester. I give place once, attend flowers, like.” “You put things table, prefer,” began May, feeling little conscience-stricken, looked pretty racks, painted shells, quaint illuminations Amy carefully made gracefully arranged. She meant kindly, Amy mistook meaning, said quickly... “Oh, certainly, way,” sweeping contributions apron, pell-mell, walked off, feeling works art insulted past forgiveness. “Now mad. Oh, dear, I wish I asked speak, Mama,” said May, looking disconsolately empty spaces table. “Girls’ quarrels soon over,” returned mother, feeling trifle ashamed part one, well might. The little girls hailed Amy treasures delight, cordial reception somewhat soothed perturbed spirit, fell work, determined succeed florally, could artistically. But everything seemed her. It late, tired. Everyone busy affairs help her, little girls hindrances, dears fussed chattered like many magpies, making great deal confusion artless efforts preserve perfect order. The evergreen arch would stay firm got up, wiggled threatened tumble head hanging baskets filled. Her best tile got splash water, left sepia tear Cupid’s cheek. She bruised hands hammering, got cold working draft, last affliction filled apprehensions morrow. Any girl reader suffered like afflictions sympathize poor Amy wish well task. There great indignation home told story evening. Her mother said shame, told done right. Beth declared would go fair all, Jo demanded take pretty things leave mean people get without her. “Because mean reason I be. I hate things, though I think I right hurt, I intend show it. They feel angry speeches huffy actions, they, Marmee?” “That right spirit, dear. A kiss blow always best, though easy give sometimes,” said mother, air one learned difference preaching practicing. In spite various natural temptations resent retaliate, Amy adhered resolution next day, bent conquering enemy kindness. She began well, thanks silent reminder came unexpectedly, opportunely. As arranged table morning, little girls anteroom filling baskets, took pet production, little book, antique cover father found among treasures, leaves vellum beautifully illuminated different texts. As turned pages rich dainty devices pardonable pride, eye fell upon one verse made stop think. Framed brilliant scrollwork scarlet, blue gold, little spirits good helping one another among thorns flowers, words, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor thyself.” “I ought, I not,” thought Amy, eye went bright page May’s discontented face behind big vases, could hide vacancies pretty work filled. Amy stood minute, turning leaves hand, reading sweet rebuke heartburnings uncharitableness spirit. Many wise true sermons preached us every day unconscious ministers street, school, office, home. Even fair table may become pulpit, offer good helpful words never season. Amy’s conscience preached little sermon text, there, many us always do, took sermon heart, straightway put practice. A group girls standing May’s table, admiring pretty things, talking change saleswomen. They dropped voices, Amy knew speaking her, hearing one side story judging accordingly. It pleasant, better spirit come her, presently chance offered proving it. She heard May say sorrowfully... “It bad, time make things, I want fill odds ends. The table complete then. Now spoiled.” “I dare say would put back asked her,” suggested someone. “How could I fuss?” began May, finish, Amy’s voice came across hall, saying pleasantly... “You may them, welcome, without asking, want them. I thinking I would offer put back, belong table rather mine. Here are, please take them, forgive I hasty carrying away last night.” As spoke, Amy returned contribution, nod smile, hurried away again, feeling easier friendly thing stay thanked it. “Now, I call lovely her, you?” cried one girl. May’s answer inaudible, another young lady, whose temper evidently little soured making lemonade, added, disagreeable laugh, “Very lovely, knew would sell table.” Now, hard. When make little sacrifices like appreciated, least, minute Amy sorry done it, feeling virtue always reward. But is, presently discovered, spirits began rise, table blossom skillful hands, girls kind, one little act seemed cleared atmosphere amazingly. It long day hard one Amy, sat behind table, often quite alone, little girls deserted soon. Few cared buy flowers summer, bouquets began droop long night. The art table attractive room. There crowd day long, tenders constantly flying fro important faces rattling money boxes. Amy often looked wistfully across, longing there, felt home happy, instead corner nothing do. It might seem hardship us, pretty, blithe young girl, tedious, trying, thought Laurie friends made real martyrdom. She go home till night, looked pale quiet knew day hard one, though made complaint, even tell done. Her mother gave extra cordial cup tea. Beth helped dress, made charming little wreath hair, Jo astonished family getting unusual care, hinting darkly tables turned. “Do anything rude, pray Jo; I fuss made, let pass behave yourself,” begged Amy, departed early, hoping find reinforcement flowers refresh poor little table. “I merely intend make entrancingly agreeable every one I know, keep corner long possible. Teddy boys lend hand, good time yet.” returned Jo, leaning gate watch Laurie. Presently familiar tramp heard dusk, ran meet him. “Is boy?” “As sure girl!” Laurie tucked hand arm air man whose every wish gratified. “Oh, Teddy, doings!” Jo told Amy’s wrongs sisterly zeal. “A flock fellows going drive by-and-by, I hanged I make buy every flower got, camp table afterward,” said Laurie, espousing warmth. “The flowers nice, Amy says, fresh ones may arrive time. I wish unjust suspicious, I wonder never came all. When people one mean thing likely another,” observed Jo disgusted tone. “Did Hayes give best gardens? I told to.” “I know that, forgot, I suppose, and, grandpa poorly, I like worry asking, though I want some.” “Now, Jo, could think need asking? They much mine. Do always go halves everything?” began Laurie, tone always made Jo turn thorny. “Gracious, I hope not! Half things would suit all. But must stand philandering here. I got help Amy, go make splendid, kind let Hayes take nice flowers Hall, I bless forever.” “Could now?” asked Laurie, suggestively Jo shut gate face inhospitable haste, called bars, “Go away, Teddy, I busy.” Thanks conspirators, tables turned night, Hayes sent wilderness flowers, lovely basket arranged best manner centerpiece. Then March family turned en masse, Jo exerted purpose, people came, stayed, laughing nonsense, admiring Amy’s taste, apparently enjoying much. Laurie friends gallantly threw breach, bought bouquets, encamped table, made corner liveliest spot room. Amy element now, gratitude, nothing more, spritely gracious possible, coming conclusion, time, virtue reward, all. Jo behaved exemplary propriety, Amy happily surrounded guard honor, Jo circulated Hall, picking various bits gossip, enlightened upon subject Chester change base. She reproached share ill feeling resolved exonerate Amy soon possible. She also discovered Amy done things morning, considered model magnanimity. As passed art table, glanced sister’s things, saw sign them. “Tucked away sight, I dare say,” thought Jo, could forgive wrongs, hotly resented insult offered family. “Good evening, Miss Jo. How Amy get on?” asked May conciliatory air, wanted show also could generous. “She sold everything worth selling, enjoying herself. The flower table always attractive, know, ‘especially gentlemen’.” Jo could resist giving little slap, May took meekly regretted minute after, fell praising great vases, still remained unsold. “Is Amy’s illumination anywhere about? I took fancy buy Father,” said Jo, anxious learn fate sister’s work. “Everything Amy’s sold long ago. I took care right people saw them, made nice little sum money us,” returned May, overcome sundry small temptations, well Amy had, day. Much gratified, Jo rushed back tell good news, Amy looked touched surprised report May’s word manner. “Now, gentlemen, I want go duty tables generously mine, especially art table,” said, ordering ‘Teddy’s own’, girls called college friends. “‘Charge, Chester, charge!’ motto table, duty like men, get money’s worth art every sense word,” said irrepressible Jo, devoted phalanx prepared take field. “To hear obey, March fairer far May,” said little Parker, making frantic effort witty tender, getting promptly quenched Laurie, said... “Very well, son, small boy!” walked off, paternal pat head. “Buy vases,” whispered Amy Laurie, final heaping coals fire enemy’s head. To May’s great delight, Mr. Laurence bought vases, pervaded hall one arm. The gentlemen speculated equal rashness sorts frail trifles, wandered helplessly afterward, burdened wax flowers, painted fans, filigree portfolios, useful appropriate purchases. Aunt Carrol there, heard story, looked pleased, said something Mrs. March corner, made latter lady beam satisfaction, watch Amy face full mingled pride anxiety, though betray pleasure till several days later. The fair pronounced success, May bade Amy goodnight, gush usual, gave affectionate kiss, look said ‘forgive forget’. That satisfied Amy, got home found vases paraded parlor chimney piece great bouquet each. “The reward merit magnanimous March,” Laurie announced flourish. “You deal principle generosity nobleness character I ever gave credit for, Amy. You behaved sweetly, I respect heart,” said Jo warmly, brushed hair together late night. “Yes, do, love ready forgive. It must dreadfully hard, working long setting heart selling pretty things. I believe I could done kindly did,” added Beth pillow. “Why, girls, need praise so. I I would done by. You laugh I say I want lady, I mean true gentlewoman mind manners, I try far I know how. I cannot explain exactly, I want little meannesses follies faults spoil many women. I far now, I best, hope time Mother is.” Amy spoke earnestly, Jo said, cordial hug, “I understand mean, I never laugh again. You getting faster think, I take lessons true politeness, learned secret, I believe. Try away, deary, get reward day, one delighted I shall.” A week later Amy get reward, poor Jo found hard delighted. A letter came Aunt Carrol, Mrs. March’s face illuminated degree read Jo Beth, her, demanded glad tidings were. “Aunt Carrol going abroad next month, wants...” “Me go her!” burst Jo, flying chair uncontrollable rapture. “No, dear, you. It Amy.” “Oh, Mother! She young, turn first. I wanted long. It would much good, altogether splendid. I must go!” “I afraid impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, us dictate offers favor.” “It always so. Amy fun I work. It fair, oh, fair!” cried Jo passionately. “I afraid partly fault, dear. When Aunt spoke day, regretted blunt manners independent spirit, writes, quoting something said—‘I planned first ask Jo, ‘favors burden her’, ‘hates French’, I think I venture invite her. Amy docile, make good companion Flo, receive gratefully help trip may give her.” “Oh, tongue, abominable tongue! Why cannot I learn keep quiet?” groaned Jo, remembering words undoing. When heard explanation quoted phrases, Mrs. March said sorrowfully... “I wish could gone, hope time, try bear cheerfully, sadden Amy’s pleasure reproaches regrets.” “I try,” said Jo, winking hard knelt pick basket joyfully upset. “I take leaf book, try seem glad, so, grudge one minute happiness. But easy, dreadful disappointment,” poor Jo bedewed little fat pincushion held several bitter tears. “Jo, dear, I selfish, I could spare you, I glad going quite yet,” whispered Beth, embracing her, basket all, clinging touch loving face Jo felt comforted spite sharp regret made want box ears, humbly beg Aunt Carrol burden favor, see gratefully would bear it. By time Amy came in, Jo able take part family jubilation, quite heartily usual, perhaps, without repinings Amy’s good fortune. The young lady received news tidings great joy, went solemn sort rapture, began sort colors pack pencils evening, leaving trifles clothes, money, passports less absorbed visions art herself. “It mere pleasure trip me, girls,” said impressively, scraped best palette. “It decide career, I genius, I shall find Rome, something prove it.” “Suppose not?” said Jo, sewing away, red eyes, new collars handed Amy. “Then I shall come home teach drawing living,” replied aspirant fame, philosophic composure. But made wry face prospect, scratched away palette bent vigorous measures gave hopes. “No, not. You hate hard work, marry rich man, come home sit lap luxury days,” said Jo. “Your predictions sometimes come pass, I believe one will. I sure I wish would, I cannot artist myself, I like able help are,” said Amy, smiling, part Lady Bountiful would suit better poor drawing teacher. “Hum!” said Jo, sigh. “If wish it, wishes always granted—mine never.” “Would like go?” asked Amy, thoughtfully patting nose knife. “Rather!” “Well, year two I send you, dig Forum relics, carry plans made many times.” “Thank you. I remind promise joyful day comes, ever does,” returned Jo, accepting vague magnificent offer gratefully could. There much time preparation, house ferment till Amy off. Jo bore well till last flutter blue ribbon vanished, retired refuge, garret, cried till could cry more. Amy likewise bore stoutly till steamer sailed. Then gangway withdrawn, suddenly came whole ocean soon roll loved best, clung Laurie, last lingerer, saying sob... “Oh, take care me, anything happen...” “I will, dear, I will, anything happens, I come comfort you,” whispered Laurie, little dreaming would called upon keep word. So Amy sailed away find Old World, always new beautiful young eyes, father friend watched shore, fervently hoping none gentle fortunes would befall happy-hearted girl, waved hand till could see nothing summer sunshine dazzling sea. CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT London Dearest People, Here I really sit front window Bath Hotel, Piccadilly. It fashionable place, Uncle stopped years ago, go anywhere else. However, mean stay long, great matter. Oh, I cannot begin tell I enjoy all! I never can, I give bits notebook, I done nothing sketch scribble since I started. I sent line Halifax, I felt pretty miserable, I got delightfully, seldom ill, deck day, plenty pleasant people amuse me. Everyone kind me, especially officers. Do laugh, Jo, gentlemen really necessary aboard ship, hold to, wait upon one, nothing do, mercy make useful, otherwise would smoke death, I afraid. Aunt Flo poorly way, liked let alone, I done I could them, I went enjoyed myself. Such walks deck, sunsets, splendid air waves! It almost exciting riding fast horse, went rushing grandly. I wish Beth could come, would done much good. As Jo, would gone sat maintop jib, whatever high thing called, made friends engineers, tooted captain’s speaking trumpet, would state rapture. It heavenly, I glad see Irish coast, found lovely, green sunny, brown cabins there, ruins hills, gentlemen’s countryseats valleys, deer feeding parks. It early morning, I regret getting see it, bay full little boats, shore picturesque, rosy sky overhead. I never shall forget it. At Queenstown one new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, I said something Lakes Killarney, sighed, sung, look me... “Oh, ever heard Kate Kearney? She lives banks Killarney; From glance eye, Shun danger fly, For fatal’s glance Kate Kearney.” Was nonsensical? We stopped Liverpool hours. It dirty, noisy place, I glad leave it. Uncle rushed bought pair dogskin gloves, ugly, thick shoes, umbrella, got shaved _à la_ mutton chop, first thing. Then flattered looked like true Briton, first time mud cleaned shoes, little bootblack knew American stood them, said, grin, “There yer har, sir. I given latest Yankee shine.” It amused Uncle immensely. Oh, I must tell absurd Lennox did! He got friend Ward, came us, order bouquet me, first thing I saw room lovely one, “Robert Lennox’s compliments,” card. Was fun, girls? I like traveling. I never shall get London I hurry. The trip like riding long picture gallery, full lovely landscapes. The farmhouses delight, thatched roofs, ivy eaves, latticed windows, stout women rosy children doors. The cattle looked tranquil ours, stood knee-deep clover, hens contented cluck, never got nervous like Yankee biddies. Such perfect color I never saw, grass green, sky blue, grain yellow, woods dark, I rapture way. So Flo, kept bouncing one side other, trying see everything whisking along rate sixty miles hour. Aunt tired went sleep, Uncle read guidebook, would astonished anything. This way went on. Amy, flying up—“Oh, must Kenilworth, gray place among trees!” Flo, darting window—“How sweet! We must go sometime, Papa?” Uncle, calmly admiring boots—“No, dear, unless want beer, brewery.” A pause—then Flo cried out, “Bless me, gallows man going up.” “Where, where?” shrieks Amy, staring two tall posts crossbeam dangling chains. “A colliery,” remarks Uncle, twinkle eye. “Here lovely flock lambs lying down,” says Amy. “See, Papa, pretty?” added Flo sentimentally. “Geese, young ladies,” returns Uncle, tone keeps us quiet till Flo settles enjoy _Flirtations Captain Cavendish_, I scenery myself. Of course rained got London, nothing seen fog umbrellas. We rested, unpacked, shopped little showers. Aunt Mary got new things, I came hurry I half ready. A white hat blue feather, muslin dress match, loveliest mantle ever saw. Shopping Regent Street perfectly splendid. Things seem cheap, nice ribbons sixpence yard. I laid stock, shall get gloves Paris. Does sound sort elegant rich? Flo I, fun it, ordered hansom cab, Aunt Uncle out, went drive, though learned afterward thing young ladies ride alone. It droll! For shut wooden apron, man drove fast Flo frightened, told stop him, outside behind somewhere, I could get him. He hear call, see flap parasol front, were, quite helpless, rattling away, whirling around corners breakneck pace. At last, despair, I saw little door roof, poking open, red eye appeared, beery voice said... “Now, then, mum?” I gave order soberly I could, slamming door, “Aye, aye, mum,” man made horse walk, going funeral. I poked said, “A little faster,” went, helter-skelter before, resigned fate. Today fair, went Hyde Park, close by, aristocratic look. The Duke Devonshire lives near. I often see footmen lounging back gate, Duke Wellington’s house far off. Such sights I saw, dear! It good Punch, fat dowagers rolling red yellow coaches, gorgeous Jeameses silk stockings velvet coats, behind, powdered coachmen front. Smart maids, rosiest children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep, dandies queer English hats lavender kids lounging about, tall soldiers, short red jackets muffin caps stuck one side, looking funny I longed sketch them. Rotten Row means ‘Route de Roi’, king’s way, like riding school anything else. The horses splendid, men, especially grooms, ride well, women stiff, bounce, according rules. I longed show tearing American gallop, trotted solemnly down, scant habits high hats, looking like women toy Noah’s Ark. Everyone rides—old men, stout ladies, little children—and young folks deal flirting here, I saw pair exchange rose buds, thing wear one button-hole, I thought rather nice little idea. In P.M. Westminster Abbey, expect describe it, impossible, I say sublime! This evening going see Fechter, appropriate end happiest day life. It late, I cannot let letter go morning without telling happened last evening. Who think came in, tea? Laurie’s English friends, Fred Frank Vaughn! I surprised, I known cards. Both tall fellows whiskers, Fred handsome English style, Frank much better, limps slightly, uses crutches. They heard Laurie be, came ask us house, Uncle go, shall return call, see can. They went theater us, good time, Frank devoted Flo, Fred I talked past, present, future fun known days. Tell Beth Frank asked her, sorry hear ill health. Fred laughed I spoke Jo, sent ‘respectful compliments big hat’. Neither forgotten Camp Laurence, fun there. What ages ago seems, it? Aunt tapping wall third time, I must stop. I really feel like dissipated London fine lady, writing late, room full pretty things, head jumble parks, theaters, new gowns, gallant creatures say “Ah!” twirl blond mustaches true English lordliness. I long see all, spite nonsense am, ever, loving... AMY PARIS Dear girls, In last I told London visit, kind Vaughns were, pleasant parties made us. I enjoyed trips Hampton Court Kensington Museum anything else, Hampton I saw Raphael’s cartoons, Museum, rooms full pictures Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, great creatures. The day Richmond Park charming, regular English picnic, I splendid oaks groups deer I could copy, also heard nightingale, saw larks go up. We ‘did’ London heart’s content, thanks Fred Frank, sorry go away, though English people slow take in, make minds cannot outdone hospitality, I think. The Vaughns hope meet us Rome next winter, I shall dreadfully disappointed not, Grace I great friends, boys nice fellows, especially Fred. Well, hardly settled here, turned again, saying come holiday, going Switzerland. Aunt looked sober first, cool could say word. And get nicely, glad came, speaks French like native, I know without him. Uncle know ten words, insists talking English loud, would make people understand him. Aunt’s pronunciation old-fashioned, Flo I, though flattered knew good deal, find not, grateful Fred ‘_parley vooing_’, Uncle calls it. Such delightful times having! Sight-seeing morning till night, stopping nice lunches gay _cafes_, meeting sorts droll adventures. Rainy days I spend Louvre, revelling pictures. Jo would turn naughty nose finest, soul art, I have, I cultivating eye taste fast I can. She would like relics great people better, I seen Napoleon’s cocked hat gray coat, baby’s cradle old toothbrush, also Marie Antoinette’s little shoe, ring Saint Denis, Charlemagne’s sword, many interesting things. I talk hours I come, time write. The Palais Royale heavenly place, full _bijouterie_ lovely things I nearly distracted I cannot buy them. Fred wanted get some, course I allow it. Then Bois Champs Elysees _tres magnifique_. I seen imperial family several times, emperor ugly, hard-looking man, empress pale pretty, dressed bad taste, I thought—purple dress, green hat, yellow gloves. Little Nap handsome boy, sits chatting tutor, kisses hand people passes four-horse barouche, postilions red satin jackets mounted guard behind. We often walk Tuileries Gardens, lovely, though antique Luxembourg Gardens suit better. Pere la Chaise curious, many tombs like small rooms, looking in, one sees table, images pictures dead, chairs mourners sit come lament. That Frenchy. Our rooms Rue de Rivoli, sitting balcony, look long, brilliant street. It pleasant spend evenings talking tired day’s work go out. Fred entertaining, altogether agreeable young man I ever knew—except Laurie, whose manners charming. I wish Fred dark, I fancy light men, however, Vaughns rich come excellent family, I find fault yellow hair, yellower. Next week Germany Switzerland, shall travel fast, I shall able give hasty letters. I keep diary, try ‘remember correctly describe clearly I see admire’, Father advised. It good practice me, sketchbook give better idea tour scribbles. Adieu, I embrace tenderly. _“Votre Amie.”_ HEIDELBERG My dear Mamma, Having quiet hour leave Berne, I try tell happened, important, see. The sail Rhine perfect, I sat enjoyed might. Get Father’s old guidebooks read it. I words beautiful enough describe it. At Coblentz lovely time, students Bonn, Fred got acquainted boat, gave us serenade. It moonlight night, one clock Flo I waked delicious music windows. We flew up, hid behind curtains, sly peeps showed us Fred students singing away below. It romantic thing I ever saw—the river, bridge boats, great fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, music fit melt heart stone. When done threw flowers, saw scramble them, kiss hands invisible ladies, go laughing away, smoke drink beer, I suppose. Next morning Fred showed one crumpled flowers vest pocket, looked sentimental. I laughed him, said I throw it, Flo, seemed disgust him, tossed window, turned sensible again. I afraid I going trouble boy, begins look like it. The baths Nassau gay, Baden-Baden, Fred lost money, I scolded him. He needs someone look Frank him. Kate said hoped would marry soon, I quite agree would well him. Frankfurt delightful. I saw Goethe’s house, Schiller’s statue, Dannecker’s famous ‘Ariadne.’ It lovely, I enjoyed I known story better. I like ask, everyone knew pretended did. I wish Jo would tell it. I ought read more, I find I know anything, mortifies me. Now comes serious part, happened here, Fred gone. He kind jolly got quite fond him. I never thought anything traveling friendship till serenade night. Since I begun feel moonlight walks, balcony talks, daily adventures something fun. I flirted, Mother, truly, remembered said me, done best. I cannot help people like me. I try make them, worries I care them, though Jo says I got heart. Now I know Mother shake head, girls say, “Oh, mercenary little wretch!”, I made mind, Fred asks me, I shall accept him, though I madly love. I like him, get comfortably together. He handsome, young, clever enough, rich—ever much richer Laurences. I think family would object, I happy, kind, well-bred, generous people, like me. Fred, eldest twin, estate, I suppose, splendid one is! A city house fashionable street, showy big houses, twice comfortable full solid luxury, English people believe in. I like it, genuine. I seen plate, family jewels, old servants, pictures country place, park, great house, lovely grounds, fine horses. Oh, would I ask! And I would rather title girls snap readily, find nothing behind. I may mercenary, I hate poverty, mean bear minute longer I help. One us _must_ marry well. Meg not, Jo not, Beth cannot yet, I shall, make everything okay round. I would marry man I hated despised. You may sure that, though Fred model hero, well, time I get fond enough fond me, let I liked. So I turning matter mind last week, impossible help seeing Fred liked me. He said nothing, little things showed it. He never goes Flo, always gets side carriage, table, promenade, looks sentimental alone, frowns anyone else ventures speak me. Yesterday dinner, Austrian officer stared us said something friend, rakish-looking baron, ‘_ein wonderschones Blondchen’_, Fred looked fierce lion, cut meat savagely nearly flew plate. He one cool, stiff Englishmen, rather peppery, Scotch blood him, one might guess bonnie blue eyes. Well, last evening went castle sunset, least us Fred, meet us going Post Restante letters. We charming time poking ruins, vaults monster tun is, beautiful gardens made elector long ago English wife. I liked great terrace best, view divine, rest went see rooms inside, I sat trying sketch gray stone lion’s head wall, scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt I would got romance, sitting there, watching Neckar rolling valley, listening music Austrian band below, waiting lover, like real storybook girl. I feeling something going happen I ready it. I feel blushy quakey, quite cool little excited. By-and-by I heard Fred’s voice, came hurrying great arch find me. He looked troubled I forgot myself, asked matter was. He said would got letter begging come home, Frank ill. So going night train time say good-by. I sorry him, disappointed myself, minute said, shook hands, said way I could mistake, “I shall soon come back, forget me, Amy?” I promise, I looked him, seemed satisfied, time anything messages good-byes, hour, miss much. I know wanted speak, I think, something hinted, promised father anything sort yet while, rash boy, old gentleman dreads foreign daughter-in-law. We shall soon meet Rome, then, I change mind, I say “Yes, thank you,” says “Will you, please?” Of course _very private_, I wished know going on. Do anxious me, remember I ‘prudent Amy’, sure I nothing rashly. Send much advice like. I use I can. I wish I could see good talk, Marmee. Love trust me. Ever AMY CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO TENDER TROUBLES “Jo, I anxious Beth.” “Why, Mother, seemed unusually well since babies came.” “It health troubles now, spirits. I sure something mind, I want discover is.” “What makes think so, Mother?” “She sits alone good deal, talk father much used. I found crying babies day. When sings, songs always sad ones, I see look face I understand. This like Beth, worries me.” “Have asked it?” “I tried twice, either evaded questions looked distressed I stopped. I never force children’s confidence, I seldom wait long.” Mrs. March glanced Jo spoke, face opposite seemed quite unconscious secret disquietude Beth’s, sewing thoughtfully minute, Jo said, “I think growing up, begins dream dreams, hopes fears fidgets, without knowing able explain them. Why, Mother, Beth’s eighteen, realize it, treat like child, forgetting woman.” “So is. Dear heart, fast grow up,” returned mother sigh smile. “Cannot helped, Marmee, must resign sorts worries, let birds hop nest, one one. I promise never hop far, comfort you.” “It great comfort, Jo. I always feel strong home, Meg gone. Beth feeble Amy young depend upon, tug comes, always ready.” “Why, know I mind hard jobs much, must always one scrub family. Amy splendid fine works I not, I feel element carpets taken up, half family fall sick once. Amy distinguishing abroad, anything amiss home, I man.” “I leave Beth hands, then, open tender little heart Jo sooner anyone else. Be kind, let think anyone watches talks her. If would get quite strong cheerful again, I wish world.” “Happy woman! I got heaps.” “My dear, they?” “I settle Bethy’s troubles, I tell mine. They wearing, keep.” Jo stitched away, wise nod set mother’s heart rest present least. While apparently absorbed affairs, Jo watched Beth, many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one seemed explain change her. A slight incident gave Jo clue mystery, thought, lively fancy, loving heart rest. She affecting write busily one Saturday afternoon, Beth alone together. Yet scribbled, kept eye sister, seemed unusually quiet. Sitting window, Beth’s work often dropped lap, leaned head upon hand, dejected attitude, eyes rested dull, autumnal landscape. Suddenly one passed below, whistling like operatic blackbird, voice called out, “All serene! Coming tonight.” Beth started, leaned forward, smiled nodded, watched passer-by till quick tramp died away, said softly herself, “How strong well happy dear boy looks.” “Hum!” said Jo, still intent upon sister’s face, bright color faded quickly came, smile vanished, presently tear lay shining window ledge. Beth whisked off, half-averted face read tender sorrow made eyes fill. Fearing betray herself, slipped away, murmuring something needing paper. “Mercy me, Beth loves Laurie!” said, sitting room, pale shock discovery believed made. “I never dreamed thing. What Mother say? I wonder her...” Jo stopped turned scarlet sudden thought. “If love back again, dreadful would be. He must. I make him!” shook head threateningly picture mischievous-looking boy laughing wall. “Oh dear, growing vengeance. Here Meg married mamma, Amy flourishing away Paris, Beth love. I one sense enough keep mischief.” Jo thought intently minute eyes fixed picture, smoothed wrinkled forehead said, decided nod face opposite, “No thank you, sir, charming, stability weathercock. So need write touching notes smile insinuating way, bit good, I it.” Then sighed, fell reverie wake till early twilight sent take new observations, confirmed suspicion. Though Laurie flirted Amy joked Jo, manner Beth always peculiarly kind gentle, everybody’s. Therefore, one thought imagining cared others. Indeed, general impression prevailed family late ‘our boy’ getting fonder ever Jo, who, however, would hear word upon subject scolded violently anyone dared suggest it. If known various tender passages nipped bud, would immense satisfaction saying, “I told so.” But Jo hated ‘philandering’, would allow it, always joke smile ready least sign impending danger. When Laurie first went college, fell love month, small flames brief ardent, damage, much amused Jo, took great interest alternations hope, despair, resignation, confided weekly conferences. But came time Laurie ceased worship many shrines, hinted darkly one all-absorbing passion, indulged occasionally Byronic fits gloom. Then avoided tender subject altogether, wrote philosophical notes Jo, turned studious, gave going ‘dig’, intending graduate blaze glory. This suited young lady better twilight confidences, tender pressures hand, eloquent glances eye, Jo, brain developed earlier heart, preferred imaginary heroes real ones, tired them, former could shut tin kitchen till called for, latter less manageable. Things state grand discovery made, Jo watched Laurie night never done before. If got new idea head, would seen nothing unusual fact Beth quiet, Laurie kind her. But given rein lively fancy, galloped away great pace, common sense, rather weakened long course romance writing, come rescue. As usual Beth lay sofa Laurie sat low chair close by, amusing sorts gossip, depended weekly ‘spin’, never disappointed her. But evening Jo fancied Beth’s eyes rested lively, dark face beside peculiar pleasure, listened intense interest account exciting cricket match, though phrases, ‘caught tice’, ‘stumped ground’, ‘the leg hit three’, intelligible Sanskrit. She also fancied, set heart upon seeing it, saw certain increase gentleness Laurie’s manner, dropped voice then, laughed less usual, little absent-minded, settled afghan Beth’s feet assiduity really almost tender. “Who knows? Stranger things happened,” thought Jo, fussed room. “She make quite angel him, make life delightfully easy pleasant dear, love other. I see help it, I believe would rest us way.” As everyone way herself, Jo began feel ought dispose speed. But go? And burning lay upon shrine sisterly devotion, sat settle point. Now, old sofa regular patriarch sofa—long, broad, well-cushioned, low, trifle shabby, well might be, girls slept sprawled babies, fished back, rode arms, menageries children, rested tired heads, dreamed dreams, listened tender talk young women. They loved it, family refuge, one corner always Jo’s favorite lounging place. Among many pillows adorned venerable couch one, hard, round, covered prickly horsehair, furnished knobby button end. This repulsive pillow especial property, used weapon defense, barricade, stern preventive much slumber. Laurie knew pillow well, regard deep aversion, unmercifully pummeled former days romping allowed, frequently debarred seat coveted next Jo sofa corner. If ‘the sausage’ called it, stood end, sign might approach repose, lay flat across sofa, woe man, woman, child dared disturb it! That evening Jo forgot barricade corner, seat five minutes, massive form appeared beside her, arms spread sofa back, long legs stretched him, Laurie exclaimed, sigh satisfaction... “Now, filling price.” “No slang,” snapped Jo, slamming pillow. But late, room it, coasting onto floor, disappeared mysterious manner. “Come, Jo, thorny. After studying skeleton week, fellow deserves petting ought get it.” “Beth pet you. I busy.” “No, bothered me, like sort thing, unless suddenly lost taste it. Have you? Do hate boy, want fire pillows him?” Anything wheedlesome touching appeal seldom heard, Jo quenched ‘her boy’ turning stern query, “How many bouquets sent Miss Randal week?” “Not one, upon word. She engaged. Now then.” “I glad it, one foolish extravagances, sending flowers things girls care two pins,” continued Jo reprovingly. “Sensible girls I care whole papers pins let send ‘flowers things’, I do? My feelings need ‘vent’.” “Mother approve flirting even fun, flirt desperately, Teddy.” “I would give anything I could answer, ‘So you’. As I cannot, I merely say I see harm pleasant little game, parties understand play.” “Well, look pleasant, I cannot learn done. I tried, one feels awkward company everybody else doing, I seem get on”, said Jo, forgetting play mentor. “Take lessons Amy, regular talent it.” “Yes, prettily, never seems go far. I suppose natural people please without trying, others always say wrong thing wrong place.” “I glad cannot flirt. It really refreshing see sensible, straightforward girl, jolly kind without making fool herself. Between ourselves, Jo, girls I know really go rate I ashamed them. They mean harm, I sure, knew fellows talked afterward, would mend ways, I fancy.” “They same, tongues sharpest, fellows get worst it, silly they, every bit. If behaved properly, would, knowing like nonsense, keep up, blame them.” “Much know it, madam,” said Laurie superior tone. “We like romps flirts, though may act sometimes. The pretty, modest girls never talked about, except respectfully, among gentleman. Bless innocent soul! If could place month would see things would astonish trifle. Upon word, I see one harum-scarum girls, I always want say friend Cock Robin... “Out upon you, fie upon you, Bold-faced jig!” It impossible help laughing funny conflict Laurie’s chivalrous reluctance speak ill womankind, natural dislike unfeminine folly fashionable society showed many samples. Jo knew ‘young Laurence’ regarded eligible parti worldly mamas, much smiled upon daughters, flattered enough ladies ages make coxcomb him, watched rather jealously, fearing would spoiled, rejoiced confessed find still believed modest girls. Returning suddenly admonitory tone, said, dropping voice, “If must ‘vent’, Teddy, go devote one ‘pretty, modest girls’ respect, waste time silly ones.” “You really advise it?” Laurie looked odd mixture anxiety merriment face. “Yes, I do, would better wait till college, whole, fitting place meantime. You half good enough for—well, whoever modest girl may be.” Jo looked little queer likewise, name almost escaped her. “That I not!” acquiesced Laurie, expression humility quite new him, dropped eyes absently wound Jo’s apron tassel round finger. “Mercy us, never do,” thought Jo, adding aloud, “Go sing me. I dying music, always like yours.” “I would rather stay here, thank you.” “Well, cannot, room. Go make useful, since big ornamental. I thought hated tied woman’s apron string?” retorted Jo, quoting certain rebellious words own. “Ah, depends wears apron!” Laurie gave audacious tweak tassel. “Are going?” demanded Jo, diving pillow. He fled once, minute well, “Up bonnets bonnie Dundee,” slipped away return till young gentleman departed high dudgeon. Jo lay long awake night, dropping sound stifled sob made fly Beth’s bedside, anxious inquiry, “What it, dear?” “I thought asleep,” sobbed Beth. “Is old pain, precious?” “No, new one, I bear it,” Beth tried check tears. “Tell it, let cure I often other.” “You cannot, cure.” There Beth’s voice gave way, clinging sister, cried despairingly Jo frightened. “Where it? Shall I call Mother?” “No, no, call her, tell her. I shall better soon. Lie ‘poor’ head. I quiet go sleep, indeed I will.” Jo obeyed, hand went softly fro across Beth’s hot forehead wet eyelids, heart full longed speak. But young was, Jo learned hearts, like flowers, cannot rudely handled, must open naturally, though believed knew Beth’s new pain, said, tenderest tone, “Does anything trouble you, deary?” “Yes, Jo,” long pause. “Would comfort tell is?” “Not now, yet.” “Then I ask, remember, Bethy, Mother Jo always glad hear help you, can.” “I know it. I tell by-and-by.” “Is pain better now?” “Oh, yes, much better, comfortable, Jo.” “Go sleep, dear. I stay you.” So cheek cheek fell asleep, morrow Beth seemed quite again, eighteen neither heads hearts ache long, loving word medicine ills. But Jo made mind, pondering project days, confided mother. “You asked day wishes were. I tell one them, Marmee,” began, sat along together. “I want go away somewhere winter change.” “Why, Jo?” mother looked quickly, words suggested double meaning. With eyes work Jo answered soberly, “I want something new. I feel restless anxious seeing, doing, learning I am. I brood much small affairs, need stirring up, I spared winter, I would like hop little way try wings.” “Where hop?” “To New York. I bright idea yesterday, it. You know Mrs. Kirke wrote respectable young person teach children sew. It rather hard find thing, I think I suit I tried.” “My dear, go service great boarding house!” Mrs. March looked surprised, displeased. “It exactly going service, Mrs. Kirke friend—the kindest soul ever lived—and would make things pleasant me, I know. Her family separate rest, one knows there. Do care do. It honest work, I ashamed it.” “Nor I. But writing?” “All better change. I shall see hear new things, get new ideas, even I much time there, I shall bring home quantities material rubbish.” “I doubt it, reasons sudden fancy?” “No, Mother.” “May I know others?” Jo looked Jo looked down, said slowly, sudden color cheeks. “It may vain wrong say it, but—I afraid—Laurie getting fond me.” “Then care way evident begins care you?” Mrs. March looked anxious put question. “Mercy, no! I love dear boy, I always have, immensely proud him, anything more, question.” “I glad that, Jo.” “Why, please?” “Because, dear, I think suited one another. As friends happy, frequent quarrels soon blow over, I fear would rebel mated life. You much alike fond freedom, mention hot tempers strong wills, get happily together, relation needs infinite patience forbearance, well love.” “That feeling I had, though I could express it. I glad think beginning care me. It would trouble sadly make unhappy, I could fall love dear old fellow merely gratitude, could I?” “You sure feeling you?” The color deepened Jo’s cheeks answered, look mingled pleasure, pride, pain young girls wear speaking first lovers, “I afraid so, Mother. He said anything, looks great deal. I think I better go away comes anything.” “I agree you, managed shall go.” Jo looked relieved, pause, said, smiling, “How Mrs. Moffat would wonder want management, knew, rejoice Annie may still hope.” “Ah, Jo, mothers may differ management, hope all—the desire see children happy. Meg so, I content success. You I leave enjoy liberty till tire it, find something sweeter. Amy chief care now, good sense help her. For Beth, I indulge hopes except may well. By way, seems brighter last day two. Have spoken her?’ “Yes, owned trouble, promised tell by-and-by. I said more, I think I know it,” Jo told little story. Mrs. March shook head, take romantic view case, looked grave, repeated opinion Laurie’s sake Jo go away time. “Let us say nothing till plan settled, I run away collect wits tragic. Beth must think I going please myself, I am, I cannot talk Laurie her. But pet comfort I gone, cure romantic notion. He many little trials sort, used it, soon get lovelornity.” Jo spoke hopefully, could rid foreboding fear ‘little trial’ would harder others, Laurie would get ‘lovelornity’ easily heretofore. The plan talked family council agreed upon, Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo, promised make pleasant home her. The teaching would render independent, leisure got might made profitable writing, new scenes society would useful agreeable. Jo liked prospect eager gone, home nest growing narrow restless nature adventurous spirit. When settled, fear trembling told Laurie, surprise took quietly. He graver usual late, pleasant, jokingly accused turning new leaf, answered soberly, “So I am, I mean one shall stay turned.” Jo much relieved one virtuous fits come then, made preparations lightened heart, Beth seemed cheerful, hoped best all. “One thing I leave especial care,” said, night left. “You mean papers?” asked Beth. “No, boy. Be good him, you?” “Of course I will, I cannot fill place, miss sadly.” “It hurt him, remember, I leave charge, plague, pet, keep order.” “I best, sake,” promised Beth, wondering Jo looked queerly. When Laurie said good-by, whispered significantly, “It bit good, Jo. My eye you, mind do, I come bring home.” CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE JO’S JOURNAL New York, November Dear Marmee Beth, I going write regular volume, I got heaps tell, though I fine young lady traveling continent. When I lost sight Father’s dear old face, I felt trifle blue, might would briny drop two, Irish lady four small children, crying less, diverted mind, I amused dropping gingerbread nuts seat every time opened mouths roar. Soon sun came out, taking good omen, I cleared likewise enjoyed journey heart. Mrs. Kirke welcomed kindly I felt home once, even big house full strangers. She gave funny little sky parlor—all had, stove it, nice table sunny window, I sit write whenever I like. A fine view church tower opposite atone many stairs, I took fancy den spot. The nursery, I teach sew, pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke’s private parlor, two little girls pretty children, rather spoiled, I fancy, took telling The Seven Bad Pigs, I doubt I shall make model governess. I meals children, I prefer great table, present I do, I bashful, though one believe it. “Now, dear, make home,” said Mrs. K. motherly way, “I drive morning night, may suppose family, great anxiety mind I know children safe you. My rooms always open you, shall comfortable I make it. There pleasant people house feel sociable, evenings always free. Come anything goes wrong, happy can. There tea bell, I must run change cap.” And bustled, leaving settle new nest. As I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked. The flights long tall house, I stood waiting head third one little servant girl lumber up, I saw gentleman come along behind her, take heavy hod coal hand, carry way up, put door near by, walk away, saying, kind nod foreign accent, “It goes better so. The little back young haf heaviness.” Was good him? I like things, Father says, trifles show character. When I mentioned Mrs. K., evening, laughed, said, “That must Professor Bhaer, always things sort.” Mrs. K. told Berlin, learned good, poor church mouse, gives lessons support two little orphan nephews educating here, according wishes sister, married American. Not romantic story, interested me, I glad hear Mrs. K. lends parlor scholars. There glass door nursery, I mean peep him, I tell looks. He almost forty, harm, Marmee. After tea go-to-bed romp little girls, I attacked big workbasket, quiet evening chatting new friend. I shall keep journal-letter, send week, goodnight, tomorrow. Tuesday Eve Had lively time seminary morning, children acted like Sancho, one time I really thought I shake round. Some good angel inspired try gymnastics, I kept till glad sit keep still. After luncheon, girl took walk, I went needlework like little Mabel ‘with willing mind’. I thanking stars I would learned make nice buttonholes, parlor door opened shut, someone began hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like big bumblebee. It dreadfully improper, I know, I could resist temptation, lifting one end curtain glass door, I peeped in. Professor Bhaer there, arranged books, I took good look him. A regular German—rather stout, brown hair tumbled head, bushy beard, good nose, kindest eyes I ever saw, splendid big voice one’s ears good, sharp slipshod American gabble. His clothes rusty, hands large, really handsome feature face, except beautiful teeth, yet I liked him, fine head, linen nice, looked like gentleman, though two buttons coat patch one shoe. He looked sober spite humming, till went window turn hyacinth bulbs toward sun, stroke cat, received like old friend. Then smiled, tap came door, called loud, brisk tone, “Herein!” I going run, I caught sight morsel child carrying big book, stopped, see going on. “Me wants Bhaer,” said mite, slamming book running meet him. “Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer. Come, then, take goot hug him, Tina,” said Professor, catching laugh, holding high head stoop little face kiss him. “Now mus tuddy lessin,” went funny little thing. So put table, opened great dictionary brought, gave paper pencil, scribbled away, turning leaf then, passing little fat finger page, finding word, soberly I nearly betrayed laugh, Mr. Bhaer stood stroking pretty hair fatherly look made think must own, though looked French German. Another knock appearance two young ladies sent back work, I virtuously remained noise gabbling went next door. One girls kept laughing affectedly, saying, “Now Professor,” coquettish tone, pronounced German accent must made hard keep sober. Both seemed try patience sorely, I heard say emphatically, “No, no, so, haf attend I say,” loud rap, struck table book, followed despairing exclamation, “Prut! It goes bad day.” Poor man, I pitied him, girls gone, took one peep see survived it. He seemed thrown back chair, tired out, sat eyes shut till clock struck two, jumped up, put books pocket, ready another lesson, taking little Tina fallen asleep sofa arms, carried quietly away. I fancy hard life it. Mrs. Kirke asked I would go five clock dinner, feeling little bit homesick, I thought I would, see sort people roof me. So I made respectable tried slip behind Mrs. Kirke, short I tall, efforts concealment rather failure. She gave seat her, face cooled off, I plucked courage looked me. The long table full, every one intent getting dinner, gentlemen especially, seemed eating time, bolted every sense word, vanishing soon done. There usual assortment young men absorbed themselves, young couples absorbed other, married ladies babies, old gentlemen politics. I think I shall care much them, except one sweetfaced maiden lady, looks something her. Cast away bottom table Professor, shouting answers questions inquisitive, deaf old gentleman one side, talking philosophy Frenchman other. If Amy here, would turned back forever because, sad relate, great appetite, shoveled dinner manner would horrified ‘her ladyship’. I mind, I like ‘to see folks eat relish’, Hannah says, poor man must needed deal food teaching idiots day. As I went upstairs dinner, two young men settling hats hall mirror, I heard one say low other, “Who new party?” “Governess, something sort.” “What deuce table for?” “Friend old lady’s.” “Handsome head, style.” “Not bit it. Give us light come on.” I felt angry first, I care, governess good clerk, I got sense, I style, people have, judging remarks elegant beings clattered away, smoking like bad chimneys. I hate ordinary people! Thursday Yesterday quiet day spent teaching, sewing, writing little room, cozy, light fire. I picked bits news introduced Professor. It seems Tina child Frenchwoman fine ironing laundry here. The little thing lost heart Mr. Bhaer, follows house like dog whenever home, delights him, fond children, though ‘bacheldore’. Kitty Minnie Kirke likewise regard affection, tell sorts stories plays invents, presents brings, splendid tales tells. The younger men quiz him, seems, call Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, make manner jokes name. But enjoys like boy, Mrs. Kirke says, takes good-naturedly like spite foreign ways. The maiden lady Miss Norton, rich, cultivated, kind. She spoke dinner today (for I went table again, fun watch people), asked come see room. She fine books pictures, knows interesting persons, seems friendly, I shall make agreeable, I want get good society, sort Amy likes. I parlor last evening Mr. Bhaer came newspapers Mrs. Kirke. She there, Minnie, little old woman, introduced prettily. “This Mamma’s friend, Miss March.” “Yes, jolly like lots,” added Kitty, ‘enfant terrible’. We bowed, laughed, prim introduction blunt addition rather comical contrast. “Ah, yes, I hear naughty ones go vex you, Mees Marsch. If again, call I come,” said, threatening frown delighted little wretches. I promised I would, departed, seems I doomed see good deal him, today I passed door way out, accident I knocked umbrella. It flew open, stood dressing gown, big blue sock one hand darning needle other. He seem ashamed it, I explained hurried on, waved hand, sock all, saying loud, cheerful way... “You haf fine day make walk. Bon voyage, Mademoiselle.” I laughed way downstairs, little pathetic, also think poor man mend clothes. The German gentlemen embroider, I know, darning hose another thing pretty. Saturday Nothing happened write about, except call Miss Norton, room full pretty things, charming, showed treasures, asked I would sometimes go lectures concerts, escort, I enjoyed them. She put favor, I sure Mrs. Kirke told us, kindness me. I proud Lucifer, favors people burden me, I accepted gratefully. When I got back nursery uproar parlor I looked in, Mr. Bhaer hands knees, Tina back, Kitty leading jump rope, Minnie feeding two small boys seedcakes, roared ramped cages built chairs. “We playing nargerie,” explained Kitty. “Dis mine effalunt!” added Tina, holding Professor’s hair. “Mamma always allows us like Saturday afternoon, Franz Emil come, she, Mr. Bhaer?” said Minnie. The ‘effalunt’ sat up, looking much earnest them, said soberly me, “I gif wort so, make large noise shall say Hush! us, go softly.” I promised so, left door open enjoyed fun much did, glorious frolic I never witnessed. They played tag soldiers, danced sang, began grow dark piled onto sofa Professor, told charming fairy stories storks chimney tops, little ‘koblods’, ride snowflakes fall. I wish Americans simple natural Germans, you? I fond writing, I go spinning forever motives economy stop me, though I used thin paper written fine, I tremble think stamps long letter need. Pray forward Amy’s soon spare them. My small news sound flat splendors, like them, I know. Is Teddy studying hard cannot find time write friends? Take good care me, Beth, tell babies, give heaps love everyone. From faithful Jo. P.S. On reading letter, strikes rather Bhaery, I always interested odd people, I really nothing else write about. Bless you! DECEMBER My Precious Betsey, As scribble-scrabble letter, I direct you, may amuse you, give idea goings on, though quiet, rather amusing, which, oh, joyful! After Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, way mental moral agriculture, young ideas begin shoot little twigs bend I could wish. They interesting Tina boys, I duty them, fond me. Franz Emil jolly little lads, quite heart, mixture German American spirit produces constant state effervescence. Saturday afternoons riotous times, whether spent house out, pleasant days go walk, like seminary, Professor keep order, fun! We good friends now, I begun take lessons. I really could help it, came droll way I must tell you. To begin beginning, Mrs. Kirke called one day I passed Mr. Bhaer’s room rummaging. “Did ever see den, dear? Just come help put books rights, I turned everything upside down, trying discover done six new handkerchiefs I gave long ago.” I went in, worked I looked me, ‘a den’ sure. Books papers everywhere, broken meerschaum, old flute mantlepiece done with, ragged bird without tail chirped one window seat, box white mice adorned other. Half-finished boats bits string lay among manuscripts. Dirty little boots stood drying fire, traces dearly beloved boys, makes slave himself, seen room. After grand rummage three missing articles found, one bird cage, one covered ink, third burned brown, used holder. “Such man!” laughed good-natured Mrs. K., put relics rag bag. “I suppose others torn rig ships, bandage cut fingers, make kite tails. It dreadful, I cannot scold him. He absent-minded goodnatured, let us boys ride roughshod. I agreed washing mending, forgets give things I forget look over, comes sad pass sometimes.” “Let mend them,” said I. “I mind it, need know. I would like to, kind bringing letters lending books.” So I got things order, knit heels two pairs socks, boggled shape queer darns. Nothing said, I hoped would find out, one day last week caught it. Hearing lessons gives others interested amused much I took fancy learn, Tina runs out, leaving door open, I hear. I sitting near door, finishing last sock, trying understand said new scholar, stupid I am. The girl gone, I thought also, still, I busily gabbling verb, rocking fro absurd way, little crow made look up, Mr. Bhaer looking laughing quietly, made signs Tina betray him. “So!” said, I stopped stared like goose, “you peep me, I peep you, bad, see, I pleasanting I say, haf wish German?” “Yes, busy. I stupid learn,” I blundered out, red peony. “Prut! We make time, fail find sense. At efening I shall gif little lesson much gladness, look you, Mees Marsch, I haf debt pay.” And pointed work ‘Yes,’ say one another, kind ladies, ‘he stupid old fellow, see do, never observe sock heels go holes more, think buttons grow new fall, believe strings make theirselves.’ “Ah! But I haf eye, I see much. I haf heart, I feel thanks this. Come, little lesson now, or—no good fairy works mine.” Of course I could say anything that, really splendid opportunity, I made bargain, began. I took four lessons, I stuck fast grammatical bog. The Professor patient me, must torment him, would look expression mild despair toss-up whether laugh cry. I tried ways, came sniff utter mortification woe, threw grammar floor marched room. I felt disgraced deserted forever, blame particle, scrambling papers together, meaning rush upstairs shake hard, came, brisk beaming I would covered glory. “Now shall try new way. You I read pleasant little _marchen_ together, dig dry book, goes corner making us trouble.” He spoke kindly, opened Hans Anderson’s fairy tales invitingly me, I ashamed ever, went lesson neck-or-nothing style seemed amuse immensely. I forgot bashfulness, pegged away (no word express it) might, tumbling long words, pronouncing according inspiration minute, best. When I finished reading first page, stopped breath, clapped hands cried hearty way, “Das ist gut! Now go well! My turn. I German, gif ear.” And away went, rumbling words strong voice relish good see well hear. Fortunately story _The Constant Tin Soldier_, droll, know, I could laugh, I did, though I understand half read, I could help it, earnest, I excited, whole thing comical. After got better, I read lessons pretty well, way studying suits me, I see grammar gets tucked tales poetry one gives pills jelly. I like much, seem tired yet, good him, it? I mean give something Christmas, I dare offer money. Tell something nice, Marmee. I glad Laurie seems happy busy, given smoking let us hair grow. You see Beth manages better I did. I jealous, dear, best, make saint him. I afraid I could like without spice human naughtiness. Read bits letters. I time write much, well. Thank Heaven Beth continues comfortable. JANUARY A Happy New Year all, dearest family, course includes Mr. L. young man name Teddy. I cannot tell much I enjoyed Christmas bundle, I get till night given hoping. Your letter came morning, said nothing parcel, meaning surprise, I disappointed, I would ‘kind feeling’ would forget me. I felt little low mind I sat room tea, big, muddy, battered-looking bundle brought me, I hugged pranced. It homey refreshing I sat floor read looked ate laughed cried, usual absurd way. The things I wanted, better made instead bought. Beth’s new ‘ink bib’ capital, Hannah’s box hard gingerbread treasure. I sure wear nice flannels sent, Marmee, read carefully books Father marked. Thank all, heaps heaps! Speaking books reminds I getting rich line, New Year’s Day Mr. Bhaer gave fine Shakespeare. It one values much, I often admired it, set place honor German Bible, Plato, Homer, Milton, may imagine I felt brought down, without cover, showed name it, “from friend Friedrich Bhaer”. “You say often wish library. Here I gif one, lids (he meant covers) many books one. Read well, help much, study character book help read world paint pen.” I thanked well I could, talk ‘my library’, I hundred books. I never knew much Shakespeare before, I never Bhaer explain me. Now laugh horrid name. It pronounced either Bear Beer, people say it, something two, Germans give it. I glad like I tell him, hope know day. Mother would admire warm heart, Father wise head. I admire both, feel rich new ‘friend Friedrich Bhaer’. Not much money, knowing would like, I got several little things, put room, would find unexpectedly. They useful, pretty, funny, new standish table, little vase flower, always one, bit green glass, keep fresh, says, holder blower, need burn Amy calls ‘mouchoirs’. I made like Beth invented, big butterfly fat body, black yellow wings, worsted feelers, bead eyes. It took fancy immensely, put mantlepiece article virtue, rather failure all. Poor is, forget servant child house, soul here, French laundrywoman Miss Norton forgot him. I glad that. They got masquerade, gay time New Year’s Eve. I mean go down, dress. But last minute, Mrs. Kirke remembered old brocades, Miss Norton lent lace feathers. So I dressed Mrs. Malaprop, sailed mask on. No one knew me, I disguised voice, one dreamed silent, haughty Miss March (for think I stiff cool, them, I whippersnappers) could dance dress, burst ‘nice derangement epitaphs, like allegory banks Nile’. I enjoyed much, unmasked fun see stare me. I heard one young men tell another knew I would actress, fact, thought remembered seeing one minor theaters. Meg relish joke. Mr. Bhaer Nick Bottom, Tina Titania, perfect little fairy arms. To see dance ‘quite landscape’, use Teddyism. I happy New Year, all, I thought room, I felt I getting little spite many failures, I cheerful time now, work will, take interest people I used to, satisfactory. Bless all! Ever loving... Jo CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR FRIEND Though happy social atmosphere her, busy daily work earned bread made sweeter effort, Jo still found time literary labors. The purpose took possession natural one poor ambitious girl, means took gain end best. She saw money conferred power, money power, therefore, resolved have, used alone, loved life. The dream filling home comforts, giving Beth everything wanted, strawberries winter organ bedroom, going abroad herself, always enough, might indulge luxury charity, years Jo’s cherished castle air. The prize-story experience seemed open way might, long traveling much uphill work, lead delightful chateau en Espagne. But novel disaster quenched courage time, public opinion giant frightened stouter-hearted Jacks bigger beanstalks hers. Like immortal hero, reposed awhile first attempt, resulted tumble least lovely giant’s treasures, I remember rightly. But ‘up take another’ spirit strong Jo Jack, scrambled shady side time got booty, nearly left behind far precious moneybags. She took writing sensation stories, dark ages, even all-perfect America read rubbish. She told one, concocted ‘thrilling tale’, boldly carried Mr. Dashwood, editor Weekly Volcano. She never read Sartor Resartus, womanly instinct clothes possess influence powerful many worth character magic manners. So dressed best, trying persuade neither excited nervous, bravely climbed two pairs dark dirty stairs find disorderly room, cloud cigar smoke, presence three gentlemen, sitting heels rather higher hats, articles dress none took trouble remove appearance. Somewhat daunted reception, Jo hesitated threshold, murmuring much embarrassment... “Excuse me, I looking Weekly Volcano office. I wished see Mr. Dashwood.” Down went highest pair heels, rose smokiest gentleman, carefully cherishing cigar fingers, advanced nod countenance expressive nothing sleep. Feeling must get matter somehow, Jo produced manuscript and, blushing redder redder sentence, blundered fragments little speech carefully prepared occasion. “A friend mine desired offer—a story—just experiment—would like opinion—be glad write suits.” While blushed blundered, Mr. Dashwood taken manuscript, turning leaves pair rather dirty fingers, casting critical glances neat pages. “Not first attempt, I take it?” observing pages numbered, covered one side, tied ribbon—sure sign novice. “No, sir. She experience, got prize tale _Blarneystone Banner_.” “Oh, she?” Mr. Dashwood gave Jo quick look, seemed take note everything on, bow bonnet buttons boots. “Well, leave it, like. We sort thing hand know present, I run eye it, give answer next week.” Now, Jo _not_ like leave it, Mr. Dashwood suit all, but, circumstances, nothing bow walk away, looking particularly tall dignified, apt nettled abashed. Just both, perfectly evident knowing glances exchanged among gentlemen little fiction ‘my friend’ considered good joke, laugh, produced inaudible remark editor, closed door, completed discomfiture. Half resolving never return, went home, worked irritation stitching pinafores vigorously, hour two cool enough laugh scene long next week. When went again, Mr. Dashwood alone, whereat rejoiced. Mr. Dashwood much wider awake before, agreeable, Mr. Dashwood deeply absorbed cigar remember manners, second interview much comfortable first. “We take (editors never say I), object alterations. It long, omitting passages I marked make right length,” said, businesslike tone. Jo hardly knew MS. again, crumpled underscored pages paragraphs, feeling tender parent might asked cut baby’s legs order might fit new cradle, looked marked passages surprised find moral reflections—which carefully put ballast much romance—had stricken out. “But, Sir, I thought every story sort moral, I took care sinners repent.” Mr. Dashwoods’s editorial gravity relaxed smile, Jo forgotten ‘friend’, spoken author could. “People want amused, preached at, know. Morals sell nowadays.” Which quite correct statement, way. “You think would alterations, then?” “Yes, new plot, pretty well worked up—language good, on,” Mr. Dashwood’s affable reply. “What you—that is, compensation—” began Jo, exactly knowing express herself. “Oh, yes, well, give twenty-five thirty things sort. Pay comes out,” returned Mr. Dashwood, point escaped him. Such trifles escape editorial mind, said. “Very well, it,” said Jo, handing back story satisfied air, dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five seemed good pay. “Shall I tell friend take another one better this?” asked Jo, unconscious little slip tongue, emboldened success. “Well, look it. Cannot promise take it. Tell make short spicy, never mind moral. What name would friend like put it?” careless tone. “None all, please, wish name appear nom de plume,” said Jo, blushing spite herself. “Just likes, course. The tale next week. Will call money, shall I send it?” asked Mr. Dashwood, felt natural desire know new contributor might be. “I call. Good morning, Sir.” As departed, Mr. Dashwood put feet, graceful remark, “Poor proud, usual, do.” Following Mr. Dashwood’s directions, making Mrs. Northbury model, Jo rashly took plunge frothy sea sensational literature, thanks life preserver thrown friend, came much worse ducking. Like young scribblers, went abroad characters scenery, banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, duchesses appeared upon stage, played parts much accuracy spirit could expected. Her readers particular trifles grammar, punctuation, probability, Mr. Dashwood graciously permitted fill columns lowest prices, thinking necessary tell real hospitality fact one hacks, offered higher wages, basely left lurch. She soon became interested work, emaciated purse grew stout, little hoard making take Beth mountains next summer grew slowly surely weeks passed. One thing disturbed satisfaction, tell home. She feeling Father Mother would approve, preferred way first, beg pardon afterward. It easy keep secret, name appeared stories. Mr. Dashwood course found soon, promised dumb, wonder kept word. She thought would harm, sincerely meant write nothing would ashamed, quieted pricks conscience anticipations happy minute show earnings laugh well-kept secret. But Mr. Dashwood rejected thrilling tales, thrills could produced except harrowing souls readers, history romance, land sea, science art, police records lunatic asylums, ransacked purpose. Jo soon found innocent experience given glimpses tragic world underlies society, regarding business light, set supplying deficiencies characteristic energy. Eager find material stories, bent making original plot, masterly execution, searched newspapers accidents, incidents, crimes. She excited suspicions public librarians asking works poisons. She studied faces street, characters, good, bad, indifferent, her. She delved dust ancient times facts fictions old good new, introduced folly, sin, misery, well limited opportunities allowed. She thought prospering finely, unconsciously beginning desecrate womanliest attributes woman’s character. She living bad society, imaginary though was, influence affected her, feeding heart fancy dangerous unsubstantial food, fast brushing innocent bloom nature premature acquaintance darker side life, comes soon enough us. She beginning feel rather see this, much describing people’s passions feelings set studying speculating own, morbid amusement healthy young minds voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings punishment, Jo needed hers, got it. I know whether study Shakespeare helped read character, natural instinct woman honest, brave, strong, endowing imaginary heroes every perfection sun, Jo discovering live hero, interested spite many human imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, one conversations, advised study simple, true, lovely characters, wherever found them, good training writer. Jo took word, coolly turned round studied him—a proceeding would much surprised him, known it, worthy Professor humble conceit. Why everybody liked puzzled Jo, first. He neither rich great, young handsome, respect called fascinating, imposing, brilliant, yet attractive genial fire, people seemed gather naturally warm hearth. He poor, yet always appeared giving something away; stranger, yet everyone friend; longer young, happy-hearted boy; plain peculiar, yet face looked beautiful many, oddities freely forgiven sake. Jo often watched him, trying discover charm, last decided benevolence worked miracle. If sorrow, ‘it sat head wing’, turned sunny side world. There lines upon forehead, Time seemed touched gently, remembering kind others. The pleasant curves mouth memorials many friendly words cheery laughs, eyes never cold hard, big hand warm, strong grasp expressive words. His clothes seemed partake hospitable nature wearer. They looked ease, liked make comfortable. His capacious waistcoat suggestive large heart underneath. His rusty coat social air, baggy pockets plainly proved little hands often went empty came full. His boots benevolent, collars never stiff raspy like people’s. “That it!” said Jo herself, length discovered genuine good toward one’s fellow men could beautify dignify even stout German teacher, shoveled dinner, darned socks, burdened name Bhaer. Jo valued goodness highly, also possessed feminine respect intellect, little discovery made Professor added much regard him. He never spoke himself, one ever knew native city man much honored esteemed learning integrity, till countryman came see him. He never spoke himself, conversation Miss Norton divulged pleasing fact. From Jo learned it, liked better Mr. Bhaer never told it. She felt proud know honored Professor Berlin, though poor language-master America, homely, hard-working life much beautified spice romance discovery gave it. Another better gift intellect shown unexpected manner. Miss Norton entree society, Jo would chance seeing her. The solitary woman felt interest ambitious girl, kindly conferred many favors sort Jo Professor. She took one night select symposium, held honor several celebrities. Jo went prepared bow adore mighty ones worshiped youthful enthusiasm afar off. But reverence genius received severe shock night, took time recover discovery great creatures men women all. Imagine dismay, stealing glance timid admiration poet whose lines suggested ethereal fed ‘spirit, fire, dew’, behold devouring supper ardor flushed intellectual countenance. Turning fallen idol, made discoveries rapidly dispelled romantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated two decanters regularity pendulum; famous divine flirted openly one Madame de Staels age, looked daggers another Corinne, amiably satirizing her, outmaneuvering efforts absorb profound philosopher, imbibed tea Johnsonianly appeared slumber, loquacity lady rendering speech impossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting mollusks glacial periods, gossiped art, devoting oysters ices characteristic energy; young musician, charming city like second Orpheus, talked horses; specimen British nobility present happened ordinary man party. Before evening half over, Jo felt completely disillusioned, sat corner recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined her, looking rather element, presently several philosophers, mounted hobby, came ambling hold intellectual tournament recess. The conversations miles beyond Jo’s comprehension, enjoyed it, though Kant Hegel unknown gods, Subjective Objective unintelligible terms, thing ‘evolved inner consciousness’ bad headache over. It dawned upon gradually world picked pieces, put together new and, according talkers, infinitely better principles before, religion fair way reasoned nothingness, intellect God. Jo knew nothing philosophy metaphysics sort, curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful, came listened sense turned adrift time space, like young balloon holiday. She looked round see Professor liked it, found looking grimmest expression ever seen wear. He shook head beckoned come away, fascinated freedom Speculative Philosophy, kept seat, trying find wise gentlemen intended rely upon annihilated old beliefs. Now, Mr. Bhaer diffident man slow offer opinions, unsettled, sincere earnest lightly spoken. As glanced Jo several young people, attracted brilliancy philosophic pyrotechnics, knit brows longed speak, fearing inflammable young soul would led astray rockets, find display empty stick scorched hand. He bore long could, appealed opinion, blazed honest indignation defended religion eloquence truth—an eloquence made broken English musical plain face beautiful. He hard fight, wise men argued well, know beaten stood colors like man. Somehow, talked, world got right Jo. The old beliefs, lasted long, seemed better new. God blind force, immortality pretty fable, blessed fact. She felt solid ground feet again, Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked one whit convinced, Jo wanted clap hands thank him. She neither, remembered scene, gave Professor heartiest respect, knew cost effort speak there, conscience would let silent. She began see character better possession money, rank, intellect, beauty, feel greatness wise man defined be, ‘truth, reverence, good will’, friend Friedrich Bhaer good, great. This belief strengthened daily. She valued esteem, coveted respect, wanted worthy friendship, wish sincerest, came near losing everything. It grew cocked hat, one evening Professor came give Jo lesson paper soldier cap head, Tina put forgotten take off. “It evident look glass coming down,” thought Jo, smile, said “Goot efening,” sat soberly down, quite unconscious ludicrous contrast subject headgear, going read Death Wallenstein. She said nothing first, liked hear laugh big, hearty laugh anything funny happened, left discover himself, presently forgot it, hear German read Schiller rather absorbing occupation. After reading came lesson, lively one, Jo gay mood night, cocked hat kept eyes dancing merriment. The Professor know make her, stopped last ask air mild surprise irresistible. . . “Mees Marsch, laugh master’s face? Haf respect me, go bad?” “How I respectful, Sir, forget take hat off?” said Jo. Lifting hand head, absent-minded Professor gravely felt removed little cocked hat, looked minute, threw back head laughed like merry bass viol. “Ah! I see now, imp Tina makes fool cap. Well, nothing, see you, lesson goes well, shall wear him.” But lesson go minutes Mr. Bhaer caught sight picture hat, unfolding it, said great disgust, “I wish papers come house. They children see, young people read. It well, I haf patience make harm.” Jo glanced sheet saw pleasing illustration composed lunatic, corpse, villain, viper. She like it, impulse made turn one displeasure fear, minute fancied paper Volcano. It not, however, panic subsided remembered even one tales it, would name betray her. She betrayed herself, however, look blush, though absent man, Professor saw good deal people fancied. He knew Jo wrote, met among newspaper offices once, never spoke it, asked questions spite strong desire see work. Now occurred ashamed own, troubled him. He say himself, “It none business. I right say anything,” many people would done. He remembered young poor, girl far away mother’s love father’s care, moved help impulse quick natural would prompt put hand save baby puddle. All flashed mind minute, trace appeared face, time paper turned, Jo’s needle threaded, ready say quite naturally, gravely... “Yes, right put you. I think good young girls see things. They made pleasant some, I would rather give boys gunpowder play bad trash.” “All may bad, silly, know, demand it, I see harm supplying it. Many respectable people make honest living called sensation stories,” said Jo, scratching gathers energetically row little slits followed pin. “There demand whisky, I think I care sell it. If respectable people knew harm did, would feel living honest. They haf right put poison sugarplum, let small ones eat it. No, think little, sweep mud street thing.” Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, walked fire, crumpling paper hands. Jo sat still, looking fire come her, cheeks burned long cocked hat turned smoke gone harmlessly chimney. “I like much send rest him,” muttered Professor, coming back relieved air. Jo thought blaze pile papers upstairs would make, hard-earned money lay rather heavily conscience minute. Then thought consolingly herself, “Mine like that, silly, never bad, I worried,” taking book, said, studious face, “Shall go on, Sir? I good proper now.” “I shall hope so,” said, meant imagined, grave, kind look gave made feel words Weekly Volcano printed large type forehead. As soon went room, got papers, carefully reread every one stories. Being little shortsighted, Mr. Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, Jo tried once, smiling see magnified fine print book. Now seemed Professor’s mental moral spectacles also, faults poor stories glared dreadfully filled dismay. “They trash, soon worse trash I go on, sensational last. I gone blindly on, hurting people, sake money. I know so, I cannot read stuff sober earnest without horribly ashamed it, I seen home Mr. Bhaer got hold them?” Jo turned hot bare idea, stuffed whole bundle stove, nearly setting chimney afire blaze. “Yes, best place inflammable nonsense. I would better burn house down, I suppose, let people blow gunpowder,” thought watched Demon Jura whisk away, little black cinder fiery eyes. But nothing remained three month’s work except heap ashes money lap, Jo looked sober, sat floor, wondering ought wages. “I think I done much harm yet, may keep pay time,” said, long meditation, adding impatiently, “I almost wish I conscience, inconvenient. If I care right, feel uncomfortable wrong, I get capitally. I cannot help wishing sometimes, Mother Father particular things.” Ah, Jo, instead wishing that, thank God ‘Father Mother particular’, pity heart guardians hedge round principles may seem like prison walls impatient youth, prove sure foundations build character upon womanhood. Jo wrote sensational stories, deciding money pay share sensation, going extreme, way people stamp, took course Mrs. Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, Hannah More, produced tale might properly called essay sermon, intensely moral it. She doubts beginning, lively fancy girlish romance felt ill ease new style would done masquerading stiff cumbrous costume last century. She sent didactic gem several markets, found purchaser, inclined agree Mr. Dashwood morals sell. Then tried child’s story, could easily disposed mercenary enough demand filthy lucre it. The person offered enough make worth try juvenile literature worthy gentleman felt mission convert world particular belief. But much liked write children, Jo could consent depict naughty boys eaten bears tossed mad bulls go particular Sabbath school, good infants go rewarded every kind bliss, gilded gingerbread escorts angels departed life psalms sermons lisping tongues. So nothing came trials, Jo corked inkstand, said fit wholesome humility... “I know anything. I wait I I try again, meantime, ‘sweep mud street’ I cannot better, honest, least.” Which decision proved second tumble beanstalk done good. While internal revolutions going on, external life busy uneventful usual, sometimes looked serious little sad one observed Professor Bhaer. He quietly Jo never knew watching see would accept profit reproof, stood test, satisfied, though words passed them, knew given writing. Not guess fact second finger right hand longer inky, spent evenings downstairs now, met among newspaper offices, studied dogged patience, assured bent occupying mind something useful, pleasant. He helped many ways, proving true friend, Jo happy, pen lay idle, learning lessons besides German, laying foundation sensation story life. It pleasant winter long one, leave Mrs. Kirke till June. Everyone seemed sorry time came. The children inconsolable, Mr. Bhaer’s hair stuck straight head, always rumpled wildly disturbed mind. “Going home? Ah, happy haf home go in,” said, told him, sat silently pulling beard corner, held little levee last evening. She going early, bade goodbye overnight, turn came, said warmly, “Now, Sir, forget come see us, ever travel way, you? I never forgive do, I want know friend.” “Do you? Shall I come?” asked, looking eager expression see. “Yes, come next month. Laurie graduates then, would enjoy commencement something new.” “That best friend, speak?” said altered tone. “Yes, boy Teddy. I proud like see him.” Jo looked then, quite unconscious anything pleasure prospect showing one another. Something Mr. Bhaer’s face suddenly recalled fact might find Laurie ‘best friend’, simply particularly wished look anything matter, involuntarily began blush, tried to, redder grew. If Tina knee. She know would become her. Fortunately child moved hug her, managed hide face instant, hoping Professor see it. But did, changed momentary anxiety usual expression, said cordially... “I fear I shall make time that, I wish friend much success, happiness. Gott bless you!” And that, shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, went away. But boys abed, sat long fire tired look face ‘heimweh’, homesickness, lying heavy heart. Once, remembered Jo sat little child lap new softness face, leaned head hands minute, roamed room, search something could find. “It me, I must hope now,” said himself, sigh almost groan. Then, reproaching longing could repress, went kissed two tousled heads upon pillow, took seldom-used meerschaum, opened Plato. He best manfully, I think found pair rampant boys, pipe, even divine Plato, satisfactory substitutes wife child home. Early was, station next morning see Jo off, thanks him, began solitary journey pleasant memory familiar face smiling farewell, bunch violets keep company, best all, happy thought, “Well, winter’s gone, I written books, earned fortune, I made friend worth I try keep life.” CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE HEARTACHE Whatever motive might been, Laurie studied purpose year, graduated honor, gave Latin oration grace Phillips eloquence Demosthenes, friends said. They there, grandfather—oh, proud—Mr. Mrs. March, John Meg, Jo Beth, exulted sincere admiration boys make light time, fail win world after-triumphs. “I got stay confounded supper, I shall home early tomorrow. You come meet usual, girls?” Laurie said, put sisters carriage joys day over. He said ‘girls’, meant Jo, one kept old custom. She heart refuse splendid, successful boy anything, answered warmly... “I come, Teddy, rain shine, march you, playing ‘Hail conquering hero comes’ jew’s-harp.” Laurie thanked look made think sudden panic, “Oh, deary me! I know say something, shall I do?” Evening meditation morning work somewhat allayed fears, decided would vain enough think people going propose given every reason know answer would be, set forth appointed time, hoping Teddy would anything make hurt poor feelings. A call Meg’s, refreshing sniff sip Daisy Demijohn, still fortified tete-a-tete, saw stalwart figure looming distance, strong desire turn run away. “Where jew’s-harp, Jo?” cried Laurie, soon within speaking distance. “I forgot it.” And Jo took heart again, salutation could called lover-like. She always used take arm occasions, not, made complaint, bad sign, talked rapidly sorts faraway subjects, till turned road little path led homeward grove. Then walked slowly, suddenly lost fine flow language, dreadful pause occurred. To rescue conversation one wells silence kept falling, Jo said hastily, “Now must good long holiday!” “I intend to.” Something resolute tone made Jo look quickly find looking expression assured dreaded moment come, made put hand imploring, “No, Teddy. Please not!” “I will, must hear me. It use, Jo, got out, sooner better us,” answered, getting flushed excited once. “Say like then. I listen,” said Jo, desperate sort patience. Laurie young lover, earnest, meant ‘have out’, died attempt, plunged subject characteristic impetuousity, saying voice would get choky then, spite manful efforts keep steady... “I loved ever since I known you, Jo, could help it, good me. I tried show it, would let me. Now I going make hear, give answer, I cannot go longer.” “I wanted save this. I thought would understand...” began Jo, finding great deal harder expected. “I know did, girls queer never know mean. They say mean yes, drive man wits fun it,” returned Laurie, entrenching behind undeniable fact. “I not. I never wanted make care so, I went away keep I could.” “I thought so. It like you, use. I loved more, I worked hard please you, I gave billiards everything like, waited never complained, I hoped would love me, though I half good enough...” Here choke could controlled, decapitated buttercups cleared ‘confounded throat’. “You, are, great deal good me, I grateful you, proud fond you, I know I cannot love want to. I tried, I cannot change feeling, would lie say I I not.” “Really, truly, Jo?” He stopped short, caught hands put question look soon forget. “Really, truly, dear.” They grove now, close stile, last words fell reluctantly Jo’s lips, Laurie dropped hands turned go on, life fence much him. So laid head mossy post, stood still Jo frightened. “Oh, Teddy, I sorry, desperately sorry, I could kill would good! I wish would take hard, I cannot help it. You know impossible people make love people not,” cried Jo inelegantly remorsefully, softly patted shoulder, remembering time comforted long ago. “They sometimes,” said muffled voice post. “I believe right sort love, I would rather try it,” decided answer. There long pause, blackbird sung blithely willow river, tall grass rustled wind. Presently Jo said soberly, sat step stile, “Laurie, I want tell something.” He started shot, threw head, cried fierce tone, “Do tell that, Jo, I cannot bear now!” “Tell what?” asked, wondering violence. “That love old man.” “What old man?” demanded Jo, thinking must mean grandfather. “That devilish Professor always writing about. If say love him, I know I shall something desperate;” looked would keep word, clenched hands wrathful spark eyes. Jo wanted laugh, restrained said warmly, too, getting excited this, “Do swear, Teddy! He old, anything bad, good kind, best friend I got, next you. Pray, fly passion. I want kind, I know I shall get angry abuse Professor. I least idea loving anybody else.” “But while, become me?” “You love someone else too, like sensible boy, forget trouble.” “I cannot love anyone else, I never forget you, Jo, Never! Never!” stamp emphasize passionate words. “What shall I him?” sighed Jo, finding emotions unmanagable expected. “You heard I wanted tell you. Sit listen, indeed I want right make happy,” said, hoping soothe little reason, proved knew nothing love. Seeing ray hope last speech, Laurie threw grass feet, leaned arm lower step stile, looked expectant face. Now arrangement conducive calm speech clear thought Jo’s part, could say hard things boy watched eyes full love longing, lashes still wet bitter drop two hardness heart wrung him? She gently turned head away, saying, stroked wavy hair allowed grow sake—how touching was, sure! “I agree Mother I suited other, quick tempers strong wills would probably make us miserable, foolish to...” Jo paused little last word, Laurie uttered rapturous expression. “Marry—no not! If loved me, Jo, I perfect saint, could make anything like.” “No, I cannot. I tried failed, I risk happiness serious experiment. We agree never shall, good friends lives, go anything rash.” “Yes, get chance,” muttered Laurie rebelliously. “Now reasonable, take sensible view case,” implored Jo, almost wit’s end. “I reasonable. I want take call ‘a sensible view’. It help me, makes harder. I believe got heart.” “I wish I not.” There little quiver Jo’s voice, thinking good omen, Laurie turned round, bringing persuasive powers bear said, wheedlesome tone never dangerously wheedlesome before, “Do disappoint us, dear! Everyone expects it. Grandpa set heart upon it, people like it, I cannot get without you. Say will, let us happy. Do, do!” Not months afterward Jo understand strength mind hold fast resolution made decided love boy, never could. It hard do, it, knowing delay useless cruel. “I cannot say ‘yes’ truly, I say all. You see I right, by-and-by, thank it...” began solemnly. “I hanged I do!” Laurie bounced grass, burning indignation idea. “Yes, will!” persisted Jo. “You get while, find lovely accomplished girl, adore you, make fine mistress fine house. I not. I homely awkward odd old, would ashamed me, quarrel—we cannot help even now, see—and I like elegant society would, would hate scribbling, I could get without it, unhappy, wish done it, everything would horrid!” “Anything more?” asked Laurie, finding hard listen patiently prophetic burst. “Nothing more, except I believe I shall ever marry. I happy I am, love liberty well hurry give mortal man.” “I know better!” broke Laurie. “You think now, come time care somebody, love tremendously, live die him. I know will, way, I shall stand see it,” despairing lover cast hat upon ground gesture would seemed comical, face tragic. “Yes, I live die him, ever comes makes love spite myself, must best can!” cried Jo, losing patience poor Teddy. “I done best, reasonable, selfish keep teasing I cannot give. I shall always fond you, fond indeed, friend, I never marry you, sooner believe better us—so now!” That speech like gunpowder. Laurie looked minute quite know himself, turned sharply away, saying desperate sort tone, “You sorry day, Jo.” “Oh, going?” cried, face frightened her. “To devil!” consoling answer. For minute Jo’s heart stood still, swung bank toward river, takes much folly, sin misery send young man violent death, Laurie one weak sort conquered single failure. He thought melodramatic plunge, blind instinct led fling hat coat boat, row away might, making better time river done race. Jo drew long breath unclasped hands watched poor fellow trying outstrip trouble carried heart. “That good, come home tender, penitent state mind, I shall dare see him,” said, adding, went slowly home, feeling murdered innocent thing, buried leaves. “Now I must go prepare Mr. Laurence kind poor boy. I wish would love Beth, perhaps may time, I begin think I mistaken her. Oh dear! How girls like lovers refuse them? I think dreadful.” Being sure one could well herself, went straight Mr. Laurence, told hard story bravely through, broke down, crying dismally insensibility kind old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, utter reproach. He found difficult understand girl could help loving Laurie, hoped would change mind, knew even better Jo love cannot forced, shook head sadly resolved carry boy harm’s way, Young Impetuosity’s parting words Jo disturbed would confess. When Laurie came home, dead tired quite composed, grandfather met knew nothing, kept delusion successfully hour two. But sat together twilight, time used enjoy much, hard work old man ramble usual, harder still young one listen praises last year’s success, seemed like love’s labor lost. He bore long could, went piano began play. The windows open, Jo, walking garden Beth, understood music better sister, played ‘_Sonata Pathetique_’, played never before. “That fine, I dare say, sad enough make one cry. Give us something gayer, lad,” said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart full sympathy, longed show knew how. Laurie dashed livelier strain, played stormily several minutes, would got bravely, momentary lull Mrs. March’s voice heard calling, “Jo, dear, come in. I want you.” Just Laurie longed say, different meaning! As listened, lost place, music ended broken chord, musician sat silent dark. “I cannot stand this,” muttered old gentleman. Up got, groped way piano, laid kind hand either broad shoulders, said, gently woman, “I know, boy, I know.” No answer instant, Laurie asked sharply, “Who told you?” “Jo herself.” “Then end it!” And shook grandfather’s hands impatient motion, though grateful sympathy, man’s pride could bear man’s pity. “Not quite. I want say one thing, shall end it,” returned Mr. Laurence unusual mildness. “You care stay home now, perhaps?” “I intend run away girl. Jo cannot prevent seeing her, I shall stay long I like,” interrupted Laurie defiant tone. “Not gentleman I think you. I disappointed, girl cannot help it, thing left go away time. Where go?” “Anywhere. I care becomes me,” Laurie got reckless laugh grated grandfather’s ear. “Take like man, anything rash, God’s sake. Why go abroad, planned, forget it?” “I cannot.” “But wild go, I promised got college.” “Ah, I mean go alone!” Laurie walked fast room expression well grandfather see. “I ask go alone. There someone ready glad go you, anywhere world.” “Who, Sir?” stopping listen. “Myself.” Laurie came back quickly went, put hand, saying huskily, “I selfish brute, but—you know—Grandfather—” “Lord help me, yes, I know, I before, young days, father. Now, dear boy, sit quietly hear plan. It settled, carried once,” said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold young man, fearful would break away father done him. “Well, sir, it?” Laurie sat down, without sign interest face voice. “There business London needs looking after. I meant attend it, I better myself, things get well Brooke manage them. My partners almost everything, I merely holding take place, time.” “But hate traveling, Sir. I cannot ask age,” began Laurie, grateful sacrifice, much preferred go alone, went all. The old gentleman knew perfectly well, particularly desired prevent it, mood found grandson assured would wise leave devices. So, stifling natural regret thought home comforts would leave behind him, said stoutly, “Bless soul, I superannuated yet. I quite enjoy idea. It good, old bones suffer, traveling nowadays almost easy sitting chair.” A restless movement Laurie suggested chair easy, like plan, made old man add hastily, “I mean marplot burden. I go I think would feel happier I left behind. I intend gad you, leave free go like, I amuse way. I friends London Paris, like visit them. Meantime go Italy, Germany, Switzerland, will, enjoy pictures, music, scenery, adventures heart’s content.” Now, Laurie felt heart entirely broken world howling wilderness, sound certain words old gentleman artfully introduced closing sentence, broken heart gave unexpected leap, green oasis two suddenly appeared howling wilderness. He sighed, said, spiritless tone, “Just like, Sir. It matter I go I do.” “It me, remember that, lad. I give entire liberty, I trust make honest use it. Promise that, Laurie.” “Anything like, Sir.” “Good,” thought old gentleman. “You care now, come time promise keep mischief, I much mistaken.” Being energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck iron hot, blighted recovered spirit enough rebel, off. During time necessary preparation, Laurie bore young gentleman usually cases. He moody, irritable, pensive turns, lost appetite, neglected dress devoted much time playing tempestuously piano, avoided Jo, consoled staring window, tragic face haunted dreams night oppressed heavy sense guilt day. Unlike sufferers, never spoke unrequited passion, would allow one, even Mrs. March, attempt consolation offer sympathy. On accounts, relief friends, weeks departure uncomfortable, everyone rejoiced ‘poor, dear fellow going away forget trouble, come home happy’. Of course, smiled darkly delusion, passed sad superiority one knew fidelity like love unalterable. When parting came affected high spirits, conceal certain inconvenient emotions seemed inclined assert themselves. This gaiety impose upon anybody, tried look sake, got well till Mrs. March kissed him, whisper full motherly solicitude. Then feeling going fast, hastily embraced round, forgetting afflicted Hannah, ran downstairs life. Jo followed minute wave hand looked round. He look round, came back, put arms stood step him, looked face made short appeal eloquent pathetic. “Oh, Jo, cannot you?” “Teddy, dear, I wish I could!” That all, except little pause. Then Laurie straightened up, said, “It right, never mind,” went away without another word. Ah, right, Jo mind, curly head lay arm minute hard answer, felt stabbed dearest friend, left without look behind him, knew boy Laurie never would come again. CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX BETH’S SECRET When Jo came home spring, struck change Beth. No one spoke seemed aware it, come gradually startle saw daily, eyes sharpened absence, plain heavy weight fell Jo’s heart saw sister’s face. It paler littler thinner autumn, yet strange, transparent look it, mortal slowly refined away, immortal shining frail flesh indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw felt it, said nothing time, soon first impression lost much power, Beth seemed happy, one appeared doubt better, presently cares Jo time forgot fear. But Laurie gone, peace prevailed again, vague anxiety returned haunted her. She confessed sins forgiven, showed savings proposed mountain trip, Beth thanked heartily, begged go far away home. Another little visit seashore would suit better, Grandma could prevailed upon leave babies, Jo took Beth quiet place, could live much open air, let fresh sea breezes blow little color pale cheeks. It fashionable place, even among pleasant people there, girls made friends, preferring live one another. Beth shy enjoy society, Jo wrapped care anyone else. So other, came went, quite unconscious interest excited them, watched sympathetic eyes strong sister feeble one, always together, felt instinctively long separation far away. They feel it, yet neither spoke it, often nearest dearest us exists reserve hard overcome. Jo felt veil fallen heart Beth’s, put hand lift up, seemed something sacred silence, waited Beth speak. She wondered, thankful also, parents seem see saw, quiet weeks shadows grew plain her, said nothing home, believing would tell Beth came back better. She wondered still sister really guessed hard truth, thoughts passing mind long hours lay warm rocks head Jo’s lap, winds blew healthfully sea made music feet. One day Beth told her. Jo thought asleep, lay still, putting book, sat looking wistful eyes, trying see signs hope faint color Beth’s cheeks. But could find enough satisfy her, cheeks thin, hands seemed feeble hold even rosy little shells collecting. It came bitterly ever Beth slowly drifting away her, arms instinctively tightened hold upon dearest treasure possessed. For minute eyes dim seeing, cleared, Beth looking tenderly hardly need say, “Jo, dear, I glad know it. I tried tell you, I could not.” There answer except sister’s cheek own, even tears, deeply moved, Jo cry. She weaker then, Beth tried comfort sustain her, arms soothing words whispered ear. “I known good while, dear, I used it, hard think bear. Try see troubled me, best, indeed is.” “Is made unhappy autumn, Beth? You feel then, keep long, you?” asked Jo, refusing see say best, glad know Laurie part Beth’s trouble. “Yes, I gave hoping then, I like it. I tried think sick fancy, would let trouble anyone. But I saw well strong full happy plans, hard feel I could never like you, I miserable, Jo.” “Oh, Beth, tell me, let comfort help you? How could shut out, bear alone?” Jo’s voice full tender reproach, heart ached think solitary struggle must gone Beth learned say goodbye health, love, life, take cross cheerfully. “Perhaps wrong, I tried right. I sure, one said anything, I hoped I mistaken. It would selfish frighten Marmee anxious Meg, Amy away, happy Laurie—at least I thought then.” “And I thought loved him, Beth, I went away I could not,” cried Jo, glad say truth. Beth looked amazed idea Jo smiled spite pain, added softly, “Then not, dearie? I afraid so, imagined poor little heart full lovelornity while.” “Why, Jo, could I, fond you?” asked Beth, innocently child. “I love dearly. He good me, I help It? But could never anything brother. I hope truly be, sometime.” “Not me,” said Jo decidedly. “Amy left him, would suit excellently, I heart things, now. I care becomes anybody you, Beth. You must get well.” “I want to, oh, much! I try, every day I lose little, feel sure I shall never gain back. It like tide, Jo, turns, goes slowly, cannot stopped.” “It shall stopped, tide must turn soon, nineteen young, Beth. I cannot let go. I work pray fight it. I keep spite everything. There must ways, cannot late. God cruel take me,” cried poor Jo rebelliously, spirit far less piously submissive Beth’s. Simple, sincere people seldom speak much piety. It shows acts rather words, influence homilies protestations. Beth could reason upon explain faith gave courage patience give life, cheerfully wait death. Like confiding child, asked questions, left everything God nature, Father Mother us all, feeling sure they, only, could teach strengthen heart spirit life life come. She rebuke Jo saintly speeches, loved better passionate affection, clung closely dear human love, Father never means us weaned, He draws us closer Himself. She could say, “I glad go,” life sweet her. She could sob out, “I try willing,” held fast Jo, first bitter wave great sorrow broke together. By Beth said, recovered serenity, “You tell go home?” “I think see without words,” sighed Jo, seemed Beth changed every day. “Perhaps not. I heard people love best often blindest things. If see it, tell me. I want secrets, kinder prepare them. Meg John babies comfort her, must stand Father Mother, Jo?” “If I can. But, Beth, I give yet. I going believe sick fancy, let think true.” said Jo, trying speak cheerfully. Beth lay minute thinking, said quiet way, “I know express myself, try anyone you, I cannot speak except Jo. I mean say I feeling never intended I live long. I like rest you. I never made plans I would I grew up. I never thought married, did. I could seem imagine anything stupid little Beth, trotting home, use anywhere there. I never wanted go away, hard part leaving all. I afraid, seems I homesick even heaven.” Jo could speak, several minutes sound sigh wind lapping tide. A white-winged gull flew by, flash sunshine silvery breast. Beth watched till vanished, eyes full sadness. A little gray-coated sand bird came tripping beach ‘peeping’ softly itself, enjoying sun sea. It came quite close Beth, looked friendly eye sat upon warm stone, dressing wet feathers, quite home. Beth smiled felt comforted, tiny thing seemed offer small friendship remind pleasant world still enjoyed. “Dear little bird! See, Jo, tame is. I like peeps better gulls. They wild handsome, seem happy, confiding little things. I used call birds last summer, Mother said reminded me—busy, quaker-colored creatures, always near shore, always chirping contented little song theirs. You gull, Jo, strong wild, fond storm wind, flying far sea, happy alone. Meg turtledove, Amy like lark writes about, trying get among clouds, always dropping nest again. Dear little girl! She ambitious, heart good tender, matter high flies, never forget home. I hope I shall see again, seems far away.” “She coming spring, I mean shall ready see enjoy her. I going well rosy time,” began Jo, feeling changes Beth, talking change greatest, seemed cost effort now, thought aloud way quite unlike bashful Beth. “Jo, dear, hope more. It good. I sure that. We miserable, enjoy together wait. We happy times, I suffer much, I think tide go easily, help me.” Jo leaned kiss tranquil face, silent kiss, dedicated soul body Beth. She right. There need words got home, Father Mother saw plainly prayed saved seeing. Tired short journey, Beth went bed, saying glad home, Jo went down, found would spared hard task telling Beth’s secret. Her father stood leaning head mantelpiece turn came in, mother stretched arms help, Jo went comfort without word. CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN NEW IMPRESSIONS At three clock afternoon, fashionable world Nice may seen Promenade des Anglais—a charming place, wide walk, bordered palms, flowers, tropical shrubs, bounded one side sea, grand drive, lined hotels villas, beyond lie orange orchards hills. Many nations represented, many languages spoken, many costumes worn, sunny day spectacle gay brilliant carnival. Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans, handsome Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, drive, sit, saunter here, chatting news, criticizing latest celebrity arrived—Ristori Dickens, Victor Emmanuel Queen Sandwich Islands. The equipages varied company attract much attention, especially low basket barouches ladies drive themselves, pair dashing ponies, gay nets keep voluminous flounces overflowing diminutive vehicles, little grooms perch behind. Along walk, Christmas Day, tall young man walked slowly, hands behind him, somewhat absent expression countenance. He looked like Italian, dressed like Englishman, independent air American—a combination caused sundry pairs feminine eyes look approvingly him, sundry dandies black velvet suits, rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, orange flowers buttonholes, shrug shoulders, envy inches. There plenty pretty faces admire, young man took little notice them, except glance blonde girl blue. Presently strolled promenade stood moment crossing, undecided whether go listen band Jardin Publique, wander along beach toward Castle Hill. The quick trot ponies’ feet made look up, one little carriages, containing single young lady, came rapidly street. The lady young, blonde, dressed blue. He stared minute, whole face woke up, and, waving hat like boy, hurried forward meet her. “Oh, Laurie, really you? I thought would never come!” cried Amy, dropping reins holding hands, great scandalization French mamma, hastened daughter’s steps, lest demoralized beholding free manners ‘mad English’. “I detained way, I promised spend Christmas you, I am.” “How grandfather? When come? Where staying?” “Very well—last night—at Chauvain. I called hotel, out.” “I much say, I know begin! Get talk ease. I going drive longing company. Flo’s saving tonight.” “What happens then, ball?” “A Christmas party hotel. There many Americans there, give honor day. You go us, course? Aunt charmed.” “Thank you. Where now?” asked Laurie, leaning back folding arms, proceeding suited Amy, preferred drive, parasol whip blue reins white ponies’ backs afforded infinite satisfaction. “I going bankers first letters, Castle Hill. The view lovely, I like feed peacocks. Have ever there?” “Often, years ago, I mind look it.” “Now tell yourself. The last I heard you, grandfather wrote expected Berlin.” “Yes, I spent month joined Paris, settled winter. He friends finds plenty amuse him, I go come, get capitally.” “That sociable arrangement,” said Amy, missing something Laurie’s manner, though could tell what. “Why, see, hates travel, I hate keep still, suit ourselves, trouble. I often him, enjoys adventures, I like feel someone glad see I get back wanderings. Dirty old hole, it?” added, look disgust drove along boulevard Place Napoleon old city. “The dirt picturesque, I mind. The river hills delicious, glimpses narrow cross streets delight. Now shall wait procession pass. It going Church St. John.” While Laurie listlessly watched procession priests canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, brotherhood blue chanting walked, Amy watched him, felt new sort shyness steal her, changed, could find merry-faced boy left moody-looking man beside her. He handsomer ever greatly improved, thought, flush pleasure meeting over, looked tired spiritless—not sick, exactly unhappy, older graver year two prosperous life made him. She could understand venture ask questions, shook head touched ponies, procession wound away across arches Paglioni bridge vanished church. “Que pensez-vous?” said, airing French, improved quantity, quality, since came abroad. “That mademoiselle made good use time, result charming,” replied Laurie, bowing hand heart admiring look. She blushed pleasure, somehow compliment satisfy like blunt praises used give home, promenaded round festival occasions, told ‘altogether jolly’, hearty smile approving pat head. She like new tone, though blase, sounded indifferent spite look. “If way going grow up, I wish would stay boy,” thought, curious sense disappointment discomfort, trying meantime seem quite easy gay. At Avigdor’s found precious home letters and, giving reins Laurie, read luxuriously wound shady road green hedges, tea roses bloomed freshly June. “Beth poorly, Mother says. I often think I ought go home, say ‘stay’. So I do, I shall never another chance like this,” said Amy, looking sober one page. “I think right, there. You could nothing home, great comfort know well happy, enjoying much, dear.” He drew little nearer, looked like old self said that, fear sometimes weighed Amy’s heart lightened, look, act, brotherly ‘my dear’, seemed assure trouble come, would alone strange land. Presently laughed showed small sketch Jo scribbling suit, bow rampantly erect upon cap, issuing mouth words, ‘Genius burns!’. Laurie smiled, took it, put vest pocket ‘to keep blowing away’, listened interest lively letter Amy read him. “This regularly merry Christmas me, presents morning, letters afternoon, party night,” said Amy, alighted among ruins old fort, flock splendid peacocks came trooping them, tamely waiting fed. While Amy stood laughing bank scattered crumbs brilliant birds, Laurie looked looked him, natural curiosity see changes time absence wrought. He found nothing perplex disappoint, much admire approve, overlooking little affectations speech manner, sprightly graceful ever, addition indescribable something dress bearing call elegance. Always mature age, gained certain aplomb carriage conversation, made seem woman world was, old petulance showed itself, strong still held own, native frankness unspoiled foreign polish. Laurie read watched feed peacocks, saw enough satisfy interest him, carried away pretty little picture bright-faced girl standing sunshine, brought soft hue dress, fresh color cheeks, golden gloss hair, made prominent figure pleasant scene. As came onto stone plateau crowns hill, Amy waved hand welcoming favorite haunt, said, pointing there, “Do remember Cathedral Corso, fishermen dragging nets bay, lovely road Villa Franca, Schubert’s Tower, below, best all, speck far sea say Corsica?” “I remember. It much changed,” answered without enthusiasm. “What Jo would give sight famous speck!” said Amy, feeling good spirits anxious see also. “Yes,” said, turned strained eyes see island greater usurper even Napoleon made interesting sight. “Take good look sake, come tell while,” said Amy, seating herself, ready good talk. But get it, though joined answered questions freely, could learn roved Continent Greece. So idling away hour, drove home again, paid respects Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left them, promising return evening. It must recorded Amy deliberately prinked night. Time absence done work young people. She seen old friend new light, ‘our boy’, handsome agreeable man, conscious natural desire find favor sight. Amy knew good points, made taste skill fortune poor pretty woman. Tarlatan tulle cheap Nice, enveloped occasions, following sensible English fashion simple dress young girls, got charming little toilettes fresh flowers, trinkets, manner dainty devices, inexpensive effective. It must confessed artist sometimes got possession woman, indulged antique coiffures, statuesque attitudes, classic draperies. But, dear heart, little weaknesses, find easy pardon young, satisfy eyes comeliness, keep hearts merry artless vanities. “I want think I look well, tell home,” said Amy herself, put Flo’s old white silk ball dress, covered cloud fresh illusion, white shoulders golden head emerged artistic effect. Her hair sense let alone, gathering thick waves curls Hebe-like knot back head. “It fashion, becoming, I cannot afford make fright myself,” used say, advised frizzle, puff, braid, latest style commanded. Having ornaments fine enough important occasion, Amy looped fleecy skirts rosy clusters azalea, framed white shoulders delicate green vines. Remembering painted boots, surveyed white satin slippers girlish satisfaction, chasseed room, admiring aristocratic feet herself. “My new fan matches flowers, gloves fit charm, real lace Aunt’s mouchoir gives air whole dress. If I classical nose mouth I perfectly happy,” said, surveying critical eye candle hand. In spite affliction, looked unusually gay graceful glided away. She seldom ran—it suit style, thought, tall, stately Junoesque appropriate sportive piquante. She walked long saloon waiting Laurie, arranged chandelier, good effect upon hair, thought better it, went away end room, ashamed girlish desire first view propitious one. It happened could done better thing, Laurie came quietly hear him, stood distant window, head half turned one hand gathering dress, slender, white figure red curtains effective well-placed statue. “Good evening, Diana!” said Laurie, look satisfaction liked see eyes rested her. “Good evening, Apollo!” answered, smiling back him, looked unusually debonair, thought entering ballroom arm personable man caused Amy pity four plain Misses Davis bottom heart. “Here flowers. I arranged myself, remembering like Hannah calls ‘sot-bookay’,” said Laurie, handing delicate nosegay, holder long coveted daily passed Cardiglia’s window. “How kind are!” exclaimed gratefully. “If I would known coming I would something ready today, though pretty this, I afraid.” “Thank you. It be, improved it,” added, snapped silver bracelet wrist. “Please not.” “I thought liked sort thing.” “Not you, sound natural, I like old bluntness better.” “I glad it,” answered, look relief, buttoned gloves her, asked tie straight, used went parties together home. The company assembled long salle manger, evening, one sees nowhere Continent. The hospitable Americans invited every acquaintance Nice, prejudice titles, secured add luster Christmas ball. A Russian prince condescended sit corner hour talk massive lady, dressed like Hamlet’s mother black velvet pearl bridle chin. A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted ladies, pronounced him, ‘a fascinating dear’, German Serene Something, come supper alone, roamed vaguely about, seeking might devour. Baron Rothschild’s private secretary, large-nosed Jew tight boots, affably beamed upon world, master’s name crowned golden halo. A stout Frenchman, knew Emperor, came indulge mania dancing, Lady de Jones, British matron, adorned scene little family eight. Of course, many light-footed, shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto, plain piquante French demoiselles, likewise usual set traveling young gentlemen disported gaily, mammas nations lined walls smiled upon benignly danced daughters. Any young girl imagine Amy’s state mind ‘took stage’ night, leaning Laurie’s arm. She knew looked well, loved dance, felt foot native heath ballroom, enjoyed delightful sense power comes young girls first discover new lovely kingdom born rule virtue beauty, youth, womanhood. She pity Davis girls, awkward, plain, destitute escort, except grim papa three grimmer maiden aunts, bowed friendliest manner passed, good her, permitted see dress, burn curiosity know distinguished-looking friend might be. With first burst band, Amy’s color rose, eyes began sparkle, feet tap floor impatiently, danced well wanted Laurie know it. Therefore shock received better imagined described, said perfectly tranquil tone, “Do care dance?” “One usually ball.” Her amazed look quick answer caused Laurie repair error fast possible. “I meant first dance. May I honor?” “I give one I put Count. He dances divinely, excuse me, old friend,” said Amy, hoping name would good effect, show Laurie trifled with. “Nice little boy, rather short Pole support... A daughter gods, Devinely tall, divinely fair,” satisfaction got, however. The set found composed English, Amy compelled walk decorously cotillion, feeling could dance tarantella relish. Laurie resigned ‘nice little boy’, went duty Flo, without securing Amy joys come, reprehensible want forethought properly punished, immediately engaged till supper, meaning relent gave signs penitence. She showed ball book demure satisfaction strolled instead rushed claim next, glorious polka redowa. But polite regrets impose upon her, galloped away Count, saw Laurie sit aunt actual expression relief. That unpardonable, Amy took notice long while, except word came chaperon dances necessary pin moment’s rest. Her anger good effect, however, hid smiling face, seemed unusually blithe brilliant. Laurie’s eyes followed pleasure, neither romped sauntered, danced spirit grace, making delightsome pastime be. He naturally fell studying new point view, evening half over, decided ‘little Amy going make charming woman’. It lively scene, soon spirit social season took possession everyone, Christmas merriment made faces shine, hearts happy, heels light. The musicians fiddled, tooted, banged enjoyed it, everybody danced could, could admired neighbors uncommon warmth. The air dark Davises, many Joneses gamboled like flock young giraffes. The golden secretary darted room like meteor dashing French-woman carpeted floor pink satin train. The serene Teuton found supper-table happy, eating steadily bill fare, dismayed garcons ravages committed. But Emperor’s friend covered glory, danced everything, whether knew not, introduced impromptu pirouettes figures bewildered him. The boyish abandon stout man charming behold, though ‘carried weight’, danced like India-rubber ball. He ran, flew, pranced, face glowed, bald head shown, coattails waved wildly, pumps actually twinkled air, music stopped, wiped drops brow, beamed upon fellow men like French Pickwick without glasses. Amy Pole distinguished equal enthusiasm graceful agility, Laurie found involuntarily keeping time rhythmic rise fall white slippers flew indefatigably winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished her, assurances ‘desolated leave early’, ready rest, see recreant knight borne punishment. It successful, three-and-twenty, blighted affections find balm friendly society, young nerves thrill, young blood dance, healthy young spirits rise, subjected enchantment beauty, light, music, motion. Laurie waked-up look rose give seat, hurried away bring supper, said herself, satisfied smile, “Ah, I thought would good!” “You look like Balzac’s ‘_Femme Peinte Par Elle-Meme_’,” said, fanned one hand held coffee cup other. “My rouge come off.” Amy rubbed brilliant cheek, showed white glove sober simplicity made laugh outright. “What call stuff?” asked, touching fold dress blown knee. “Illusion.” “Good name it. It pretty—new thing, it?” “It old hills. You seen dozens girls, never found pretty till now—stupide!” “I never saw before, accounts mistake, see.” “None that, forbidden. I would rather take coffee compliments now. No, lounge, makes nervous.” Laurie sat bold upright, meekly took empty plate feeling odd sort pleasure ‘little Amy’ order about, lost shyness now, felt irrestible desire trample him, girls delightful way lords creation show signs subjection. “Where learn sort thing?” asked quizzical look. “As ‘this sort thing’ rather vague expression, would kindly explain?” returned Amy, knowing perfectly well meant, wickedly leaving describe indescribable. “Well—the general air, style, self-possession, the—the—illusion—you know”, laughed Laurie, breaking helping quandary new word. Amy gratified, course show it, demurely answered, “Foreign life polishes one spite one’s self. I study well play, this”—with little gesture toward dress—“why, tulle cheap, posies nothing, I used making poor little things.” Amy rather regretted last sentence, fearing good taste, Laurie liked better it, found admiring respecting brave patience made opportunity, cheerful spirit covered poverty flowers. Amy know looked kindly, filled book name, devoted rest evening delightful manner; impulse wrought agreeable change result one new impressions unconsciously giving receiving. CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT ON THE SHELF In France young girls dull time till married, ‘Vive la liberte!’ becomes motto. In America, everyone knows, girls early sign declaration independence, enjoy freedom republican zest, young matrons usually abdicate first heir throne go seclusion almost close French nunnery, though means quiet. Whether like not, virtually put upon shelf soon wedding excitement over, might exclaim, pretty woman day, “I handsome ever, one takes notice I married.” Not belle even fashionable lady, Meg experience affliction till babies year old, little world primitive customs prevailed, found admired beloved ever. As womanly little woman, maternal instinct strong, entirely absorbed children, utter exclusion everything everybody else. Day night brooded tireless devotion anxiety, leaving John tender mercies help, Irish lady presided kitchen department. Being domestic man, John decidedly missed wifely attentions accustomed receive, adored babies, cheerfully relinquished comfort time, supposing masculine ignorance peace would soon restored. But three months passed, return repose. Meg looked worn nervous, babies absorbed every minute time, house neglected, Kitty, cook, took life ‘aisy’, kept short commons. When went morning bewildered small commissions captive mamma, came gaily night, eager embrace family, quenched “Hush! They asleep worrying day.” If proposed little amusement home, “No, would disturb babies.” If hinted lecture concert, answered reproachful look, decided—“Leave children pleasure, never!” His sleep broken infant wails visions phantom figure pacing noiselessly fro watches night. His meals interrupted frequent flight presiding genius, deserted him, half-helped, muffled chirp sounded nest above. And read paper evening, Demi’s colic got shipping list Daisy’s fall affected price stocks, Mrs. Brooke interested domestic news. The poor man uncomfortable, children bereft wife, home merely nursery perpetual ‘hushing’ made feel like brutal intruder whenever entered sacred precincts Babyland. He bore patiently six months, signs amendment appeared, paternal exiles do—tried get little comfort elsewhere. Scott married gone housekeeping far off, John fell way running hour two evening, parlor empty, wife singing lullabies seemed end. Mrs. Scott lively, pretty girl, nothing agreeable, performed mission successfully. The parlor always bright attractive, chessboard ready, piano tune, plenty gay gossip, nice little supper set forth tempting style. John would preferred fireside lonely, gratefully took next best thing enjoyed neighbor’s society. Meg rather approved new arrangement first, found relief know John good time instead dozing parlor, tramping house waking children. But by-and-by, teething worry idols went sleep proper hours, leaving Mamma time rest, began miss John, find workbasket dull company, sitting opposite old dressing gown, comfortably scorching slippers fender. She would ask stay home, felt injured know wanted without told, entirely forgetting many evenings waited vain. She nervous worn watching worry, unreasonable frame mind best mothers occasionally experience domestic cares oppress them. Want exercise robs cheerfulness, much devotion idol American women, teapot, makes feel nerve muscle. “Yes,” would say, looking glass, “I getting old ugly. John find interesting longer, leaves faded wife goes see pretty neighbor, incumbrances. Well, babies love me, care I thin pale time crimp hair, comfort, day John see I gladly sacrificed them, he, precious?” To pathetic appeal Daisy would answer coo, Demi crow, Meg would put lamentations maternal revel, soothed solitude time being. But pain increased politics absorbed John, always running discuss interesting points Scott, quite unconscious Meg missed him. Not word say, however, till mother found tears one day, insisted knowing matter was, Meg’s drooping spirits escaped observation. “I would tell anyone except you, Mother, I really need advice, John goes much longer I might well widowed,” replied Mrs. Brooke, drying tears Daisy’s bib injured air. “Goes how, dear?” asked mother anxiously. “He away day, night I want see him, continually going Scotts’. It fair I hardest work, never amusement. Men selfish, even best them.” “So women. Do blame John till see wrong yourself.” “But cannot right neglect me.” “Do neglect him?” “Why, Mother, I thought would take part!” “So I do, far sympathizing goes, I think fault yours, Meg.” “I see how.” “Let show you. Did John ever neglect you, call it, made point give society evening, leisure time?” “No, I cannot now, two babies tend.” “I think could, dear, I think ought. May I speak quite freely, remember Mother blames well Mother sympathizes?” “Indeed I will! Speak I little Meg again. I often feel I needed teaching ever since babies look everything.” Meg drew low chair beside mother’s, little interruption either lap, two women rocked talked lovingly together, feeling tie motherhood made one ever. “You made mistake young wives make—forgotten duty husband love children. A natural forgivable mistake, Meg, one better remedied take different ways, children draw nearer ever, separate you, yours, John nothing support them. I seen weeks, spoken, feeling sure would come right time.” “I afraid not. If I ask stay, think I jealous, I would insult idea. He see I want him, I know tell without words.” “Make pleasant want go away. My dear, longing little home, home without you, always nursery.” “Ought I there?” “Not time, much confinement makes nervous, unfitted everything. Besides, owe something John well babies. Do neglect husband children, shut nursery, teach help it. His place well yours, children need him. Let feel part do, gladly faithfully, better all.” “You really think so, Mother?” “I know it, Meg, I tried it, I seldom give advice unless I proved practicability. When Jo little, I went are, feeling I duty unless I devoted wholly you. Poor Father took books, I refused offers help, left try experiment alone. I struggled along well I could, Jo much me. I nearly spoiled indulgence. You poorly, I worried till I fell sick myself. Then Father came rescue, quietly managed everything, made helpful I saw mistake, never able get without since. That secret home happiness. He let business wean little cares duties affect us all, I try let domestic worries destroy interest pursuits. Each part alone many things, home work together, always.” “It so, Mother, great wish husband children yours. Show how, I anything say.” “You always docile daughter. Well, dear, I you, I would let John management Demi, boy needs training, none soon begin. Then I would I often proposed, let Hannah come help you. She capital nurse, may trust precious babies housework. You need exercise, Hannah would enjoy rest, John would find wife again. Go more, keep cheerful well busy, sunshine-maker family, get dismal fair weather. Then I would try take interest whatever John likes—talk him, let read you, exchange ideas, help way. Do shut bandbox woman, understand going on, educate take part world’s work, affects yours.” “John sensible, I afraid think I stupid I ask questions politics things.” “I believe would. Love covers multitude sins, could ask freely him? Try it, see find society far agreeable Mrs. Scott’s suppers.” “I will. Poor John! I afraid I neglected sadly, I thought I right, never said anything.” “He tried selfish, felt rather forlorn, I fancy. This time, Meg, young married people apt grow apart, time ought together, first tenderness soon wears off, unless care taken preserve it. And time beautiful precious parents first years little lives given train. Do let John stranger babies, keep safe happy world trial temptation anything else, learn know love one another should. Now, dear, good-by. Think Mother’s preachment, act upon seems good, God bless all.” Meg think over, found good, acted upon it, though first attempt made exactly planned it. Of course children tyrannized her, ruled house soon found kicking squalling brought whatever wanted. Mamma abject slave caprices, Papa easily subjugated, occasionally afflicted tender spouse attempt paternal discipline obstreperous son. For Demi inherited trifle sire’s firmness character, call obstinacy, made little mind anything, king’s horses king’s men could change pertinacious little mind. Mamma thought dear young taught conquer prejudices, Papa believed never soon learn obedience. So Master Demi early discovered undertook ‘wrastle’ ‘Parpar’, always got worst it, yet like Englishman, baby respected man conquered him, loved father whose grave “No, no,” impressive Mamma’s love pats. A days talk mother, Meg resolved try social evening John, ordered nice supper, set parlor order, dressed prettily, put children bed early, nothing interfere experiment. But unfortunately Demi’s unconquerable prejudice going bed, night decided go rampage. So poor Meg sang rocked, told stories tried every sleep-prevoking wile could devise, vain, big eyes would shut, long Daisy gone byelow, like chubby little bunch good nature was, naughty Demi lay staring light, discouragingly wide-awake expression countenance. “Will Demi lie still like good boy, Mamma runs gives poor Papa tea?” asked Meg, hall door softly closed, well-known step went tip-toeing dining room. “Me tea!” said Demi, preparing join revel. “No, I save little cakies breakfast, go bye-bye like Daisy. Will you, lovey?” “Iss!” Demi shut eyes tight, catch sleep hurry desired day. Taking advantage propitious moment, Meg slipped away ran greet husband smiling face little blue bow hair especial admiration. He saw said pleased surprise, “Why, little mother, gay tonight. Do expect company?” “Only you, dear.” “Is birthday, anniversary, anything?” “No, I tired dowdy, I dressed change. You always make nice table, matter tired are, I I time?” “I respect you, dear,” said old-fashioned John. “Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,” laughed Meg, looking young pretty again, nodded teapot. “Well, altogether delightful, like old times. This tastes right. I drink health, dear.” John sipped tea air reposeful rapture, short duration however, put cup, door handle rattled mysteriously, little voice heard, saying impatiently... “Opy doy. Me’s tummin!” “It naughty boy. I told go sleep alone, is, downstairs, getting death a-cold pattering canvas,” said Meg, answering call. “Mornin’ now,” announced Demi joyful tone entered, long nightgown gracefully festooned arm every curl bobbing gayly pranced table, eyeing ‘cakies’ loving glances. “No, morning yet. You must go bed, trouble poor Mamma. Then little cake sugar it.” “Me loves Parpar,” said artful one, preparing climb paternal knee revel forbidden joys. But John shook head, said Meg... “If told stay there, go sleep alone, make it, never learn mind you.” “Yes, course. Come, Demi,” Meg led son away, feeling strong desire spank little marplot hopped beside her, laboring delusion bribe administered soon reached nursery. Nor disappointed, shortsighted woman actually gave lump sugar, tucked bed, forbade promenades till morning. “Iss!” said Demi perjured, blissfully sucking sugar, regarding first attempt eminently successful. Meg returned place, supper progressing pleasantly, little ghost walked again, exposed maternal delinquencies boldly demanding, “More sudar, Marmar.” “Now do,” said John, hardening heart engaging little sinner. “We shall never know peace till child learns go bed properly. You made slave long enough. Give one lesson, end it. Put bed leave him, Meg.” “He stay there, never unless I sit him.” “I manage him. Demi, go upstairs, get bed, Mamma bids you.” “S’ant!” replied young rebel, helping coveted ‘cakie’, beginning eat calm audacity. “You must never say Papa. I shall carry go yourself.” “Go ’way, love Parpar.” Demi retired mother’s skirts protection. But even refuge proved unavailing, delivered enemy, “Be gentle him, John,” struck culprit dismay, Mamma deserted him, judgment day hand. Bereft cake, defrauded frolic, borne away strong hand detested bed, poor Demi could restrain wrath, openly defied Papa, kicked screamed lustily way upstairs. The minute put bed one side, rolled other, made door, ignominiously caught tail little toga put back again, lively performance kept till young man’s strength gave out, devoted roaring top voice. This vocal exercise usually conquered Meg, John sat unmoved post popularly believed deaf. No coaxing, sugar, lullaby, story, even light put red glow fire enlivened ‘big dark’ Demi regarded curiosity rather fear. This new order things disgusted him, howled dismally ‘Marmar’, angry passions subsided, recollections tender bondwoman returned captive autocrat. The plaintive wail succeeded passionate roar went Meg’s heart, ran say beseechingly... “Let stay him, good now, John.” “No, dear. I told must go sleep, bid him, must, I stay night.” “But cry sick,” pleaded Meg, reproaching deserting boy. “No, not, tired soon drop matter settled, understand got mind. Do interfere, I manage him.” “He child, I cannot spirit broken harshness.” “He child, I temper spoiled indulgence. Go down, dear, leave boy me.” When John spoke masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, never regretted docility. “Please let kiss once, John?” “Certainly. Demi, say good night Mamma, let go rest, tired taking care day.” Meg always insisted upon kiss victory, given, Demi sobbed quietly, lay quite still bottom bed, whither wriggled anguish mind. “Poor little man, worn sleep crying. I cover up, go set Meg’s heart rest,” thought John, creeping bedside, hoping find rebellious heir asleep. But not, moment father peeped him, Demi’s eyes opened, little chin began quiver, put arms, saying penitent hiccough, “Me’s dood, now.” Sitting stairs outside Meg wondered long silence followed uproar, imagining sorts impossible accidents, slipped room set fears rest. Demi lay fast asleep, usual spreadeagle attitude, subdued bunch, cuddled close circle father’s arm holding father’s finger, felt justice tempered mercy, gone sleep sadder wiser baby. So held, John waited womanly patience till little hand relaxed hold, waiting fallen asleep, tired tussle son whole day’s work. As Meg stood watching two faces pillow, smiled herself, slipped away again, saying satisfied tone, “I never need fear John harsh babies. He know manage them, great help, Demi getting much me.” When John came last, expecting find pensive reproachful wife, agreeably surprised find Meg placidly trimming bonnet, greeted request read something election, tired. John saw minute revolution kind going on, wisely asked questions, knowing Meg transparent little person, could keep secret save life, therefore clue would soon appear. He read long debate amiable readiness explained lucid manner, Meg tried look deeply interested, ask intelligent questions, keep thoughts wandering state nation state bonnet. In secret soul, however, decided politics bad mathematics, mission politicians seemed calling names, kept feminine ideas herself, John paused, shook head said thought diplomatic ambiguity, “Well, I really see coming to.” John laughed, watched minute, poised pretty little preparation lace flowers hand, regarded genuine interest harangue failed waken. “She trying like politics sake, I try like millinery hers, fair,” thought John Just, adding aloud, “That pretty. Is call breakfast cap?” “My dear man, bonnet! My best go-to-concert-and-theater bonnet.” “I beg pardon, small, I naturally mistook one flyaway things sometimes wear. How keep on?” “These bits lace fastened chin rosebud, so,” Meg illustrated putting bonnet regarding air calm satisfaction irresistible. “It love bonnet, I prefer face inside, looks young happy again,” John kissed smiling face, great detriment rosebud chin. “I glad like it, I want take one new concerts night. I really need music put tune. Will you, please?” “Of course I will, heart, anywhere else like. You shut long, end good, I shall enjoy it, things. What put head, little mother?” “Well, I talk Marmee day, told nervous cross sorts I felt, said I needed change less care, Hannah help children, I see things house more, little fun, keep getting fidgety, broken-down old woman time. It experiment, John, I want try sake much mine, I neglected shamefully lately, I going make home used be, I can. You object, I hope?” Never mind John said, narrow escape little bonnet utter ruin. All business know John appear object, judging changes gradually took place house inmates. It Paradise means, everyone better division labor system. The children throve paternal rule, accurate, steadfast John brought order obedience Babydom, Meg recovered spirits composed nerves plenty wholesome exercise, little pleasure, much confidential conversation sensible husband. Home grew homelike again, John wish leave it, unless took Meg him. The Scotts came Brookes’ now, everyone found little house cheerful place, full happiness, content, family love. Even Sallie Moffatt liked go there. “It always quiet pleasant here, good, Meg,” used say, looking wistful eyes, trying discover charm, might use great house, full splendid loneliness, riotous, sunny-faced babies there, Ned lived world own, place her. This household happiness come once, John Meg found key it, year married life taught use it, unlocking treasuries real home love mutual helpfulness, poorest may possess, richest cannot buy. This sort shelf young wives mothers may consent laid, safe restless fret fever world, finding loyal lovers little sons daughters cling them, undaunted sorrow, poverty, age, walking side side, fair stormy weather, faithful friend, is, true sense good old Saxon word, ‘house-band’, learning, Meg learned, woman’s happiest kingdom home, highest honor art ruling queen, wise wife mother. CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE LAZY LAURENCE Laurie went Nice intending stay week, remained month. He tired wandering alone, Amy’s familiar presence seemed give homelike charm foreign scenes bore part. He rather missed ‘petting’ used receive, enjoyed taste again, attentions, however flattering, strangers, half pleasant sisterly adoration girls home. Amy never would pet like others, glad see now, quite clung him, feeling representative dear family longed would confess. They naturally took comfort other’s society much together, riding, walking, dancing, dawdling, Nice one industrious gay season. But, apparently amusing careless fashion, half-consciously making discoveries forming opinions other. Amy rose daily estimation friend, sank hers, felt truth word spoken. Amy tried please, succeeded, grateful many pleasures gave her, repaid little services womanly women know lend indescribable charm. Laurie made effort kind, let drift along comfortably possible, trying forget, feeling women owed kind word one cold him. It cost effort generous, would given Amy trinkets Nice would taken them, time felt could change opinion forming him, rather dreaded keen blue eyes seemed watch half-sorrowful, half-scornful surprise. “All rest gone Monaco day. I preferred stay home write letters. They done now, I going Valrosa sketch, come?” said Amy, joined Laurie one lovely day lounged usual, noon. “Well, yes, rather warm long walk?” answered slowly, shaded salon looked inviting glare without. “I going little carriage, Baptiste drive, nothing hold umbrella, keep gloves nice,” returned Amy, sarcastic glance immaculate kids, weak point Laurie. “Then I go pleasure.” put hand sketchbook. But tucked arm sharp... “Do trouble yourself. It exertion me, look equal it.” Laurie lifted eyebrows followed leisurely pace ran downstairs, got carriage took reins himself, left little Baptiste nothing fold arms fall asleep perch. The two never quarreled. Amy well-bred, Laurie lazy, minute peeped hatbrim inquiring air. She answered smile, went together amicable manner. It lovely drive, along winding roads rich picturesque scenes delight beauty-loving eyes. Here ancient monastery, whence solemn chanting monks came them. There bare-legged shepherd, wooden shoes, pointed hat, rough jacket one shoulder, sat piping stone goats skipped among rocks lay feet. Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden panniers freshly cut grass passed by, pretty girl capaline sitting green piles, old woman spinning distaff went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran quaint stone hovels offer nosegays, bunches oranges still bough. Gnarled olive trees covered hills dusky foliage, fruit hung golden orchard, great scarlet anemones fringed roadside, beyond green slopes craggy heights, Maritime Alps rose sharp white blue Italian sky. Valrosa well deserved name, climate perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung archway, thrust bars great gate sweet welcome passers-by, lined avenue, winding lemon trees feathery palms villa hill. Every shadowy nook, seats invited one stop rest, mass bloom, every cool grotto marble nymph smiling veil flowers every fountain reflected crimson, white, pale pink roses, leaning smile beauty. Roses covered walls house, draped cornices, climbed pillars, ran riot balustrade wide terrace, whence one looked sunny Mediterranean, white-walled city shore. “This regular honeymoon paradise, it? Did ever see roses?” asked Amy, pausing terrace enjoy view, luxurious whiff perfume came wandering by. “No, felt thorns,” returned Laurie, thumb mouth, vain attempt capture solitary scarlet flower grew beyond reach. “Try lower down, pick thorns,” said Amy, gathering three tiny cream-colored ones starred wall behind her. She put buttonhole peace offering, stood minute looking curious expression, Italian part nature touch superstition, state half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy, imaginative young men find significance trifles food romance everywhere. He thought Jo reaching thorny red rose, vivid flowers became her, often worn ones like greenhouse home. The pale roses Amy gave sort Italians lay dead hands, never bridal wreaths, moment wondered omen Jo himself, next instant American common sense got better sentimentality, laughed heartier laugh Amy heard since came. “It good advice, would better take save fingers,” said, thinking speech amused him. “Thank you, I will,” answered jest, months later earnest. “Laurie, going grandfather?” asked presently, settled rustic seat. “Very soon.” “You said dozen times within last three weeks.” “I dare say, short answers save trouble.” “He expects you, really ought go.” “Hospitable creature! I know it.” “Then it?” “Natural depravity, I suppose.” “Natural indolence, mean. It really dreadful!” Amy looked severe. “Not bad seems, I plague I went, I might well stay plague little longer, bear better, fact I think agrees excellently,” Laurie composed lounge broad ledge balustrade. Amy shook head opened sketchbook air resignation, made mind lecture ‘that boy’ minute began again. “What now?” “Watching lizards.” “No, no. I mean intend wish do?” “Smoke cigarette, allow me.” “How provoking are! I approve cigars I allow condition let put sketch. I need figure.” “With pleasure life. How me, full length three-quarters, head heels? I respectfully suggest recumbent posture, put also call ‘Dolce far niente’.” “Stay are, go sleep like. I intend work hard,” said Amy energetic tone. “What delightful enthusiasm!” leaned tall urn air entire satisfaction. “What would Jo say saw now?” asked Amy impatiently, hoping stir mention still energetic sister’s name. “As usual, ‘Go away, Teddy. I busy!’” He laughed spoke, laugh natural, shade passed face, utterance familiar name touched wound healed yet. Both tone shadow struck Amy, seen heard before, looked time catch new expression Laurie’s face—a hard bitter look, full pain, dissatisfaction, regret. It gone could study listless expression back again. She watched moment artistic pleasure, thinking like Italian looked, lay basking sun uncovered head eyes full southern dreaminess, seemed forgotten fallen reverie. “You look like effigy young knight asleep tomb,” said, carefully tracing well-cut profile defined dark stone. “Wish I was!” “That foolish wish, unless spoiled life. You changed, I sometimes think—” Amy stopped, half-timid, half-wistful look, significant unfinished speech. Laurie saw understood affectionate anxiety hesitated express, looking straight eyes, said, used say mother, “It right, madam.” That satisfied set rest doubts begun worry lately. It also touched her, showed did, cordial tone said... “I glad that! I think would bad boy, I fancied might wasted money wicked Baden-Baden, lost heart charming Frenchwoman husband, got scrapes young men seem consider necessary part foreign tour. Do stay sun, come lie grass ‘let us friendly’, Jo used say got sofa corner told secrets.” Laurie obediently threw turf, began amuse sticking daisies ribbons Amy’s hat, lay there. “I ready secrets.” glanced decided expression interest eyes. “I none tell. You may begin.” “Have one bless with. I thought perhaps would news home..” “You heard come lately. Do hear often? I fancied Jo would send volumes.” “She busy. I roving so, impossible regular, know. When begin great work art, Raphaella?” asked, changing subject abruptly another pause, wondering Amy knew secret wanted talk it. “Never,” answered, despondent decided air. “Rome took vanity me, seeing wonders there, I felt insignificant live gave foolish hopes despair.” “Why you, much energy talent?” “That why, talent genius, amount energy make so. I want great, nothing. I common-place dauber, I intend try more.” “And going now, I may ask?” “Polish talents, ornament society, I get chance.” It characteristic speech, sounded daring, audacity becomes young people, Amy’s ambition good foundation. Laurie smiled, liked spirit took new purpose long-cherished one died, spent time lamenting. “Good! And Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.” Amy preserved discreet silence, conscious look downcast face made Laurie sit say gravely, “Now I going play brother, ask questions. May I?” “I promise answer.” “Your face will, tongue not. You woman world enough yet hide feelings, dear. I heard rumors Fred last year, private opinion called home suddenly detained long, something would come it, hey?” “That say,” Amy’s grim reply, lips would smile, traitorous sparkle eye betrayed knew power enjoyed knowledge. “You engaged, I hope?” Laurie looked elder-brotherly grave sudden. “No.” “But be, comes back goes properly knees, you?” “Very likely.” “Then fond old Fred?” “I could be, I tried.” “But intend try till proper moment? Bless soul, unearthly prudence! He good fellow, Amy, man I fancied would like.” “He rich, gentleman, delightful manners,” began Amy, trying quite cool dignified, feeling little ashamed herself, spite sincerity intentions. “I understand. Queens society cannot get without money, mean make good match, start way? Quite right proper, world goes, sounds odd lips one mother’s girls.” “True, nevertheless.” A short speech, quiet decision uttered contrasted curiously young speaker. Laurie felt instinctively laid again, sense disappointment could explain. His look silence, well certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, made resolve deliver lecture without delay. “I wish would favor rouse little,” said sharply. “Do me, dear girl.” “I could, I tried.” looked would like summary style. “Try, then. I give leave,” returned Laurie, enjoyed someone tease, long abstinence favorite pastime. “You would angry five minutes.” “I never angry you. It takes two flints make fire. You cool soft snow.” “You know I do. Snow produces glow tingle, applied rightly. Your indifference half affectation, good stirring would prove it.” “Stir away, hurt may amuse you, big man said little wife beat him. Regard light husband carpet, beat till tired, sort exercise agrees you.” Being decidedly nettled herself, longing see shake apathy altered him, Amy sharpened tongue pencil, began. “Flo I got new name you. It Lazy Laurence. How like it?” She thought would annoy him, folded arms head, imperturbable, “That bad. Thank you, ladies.” “Do want know I honestly think you?” “Pining told.” “Well, I despise you.” If even said ‘I hate you’ petulant coquettish tone, would laughed rather liked it, grave, almost sad, accent voice made open eyes, ask quickly... “Why, please?” “Because, every chance good, useful, happy, faulty, lazy, miserable.” “Strong language, mademoiselle.” “If like it, I go on.” “Pray do, quite interesting.” “I thought would find so. Selfish people always like talk themselves.” “Am I selfish?” question slipped involuntarily tone surprise, one virtue prided generosity. “Yes, selfish,” continued Amy, calm, cool voice, twice effective angry one. “I show how, I studied frolicking, I satisfied you. Here abroad nearly six months, done nothing waste time money disappoint friends.” “Is fellow pleasure four-year grind?” “You look would much. At rate, none better it, far I see. I said first met improved. Now I take back, I think half nice I left home. You grown abominably lazy, like gossip, waste time frivolous things, contented petted admired silly people, instead loved respected wise ones. With money, talent, position, health, beauty, ah like old Vanity! But truth, I cannot help saying it, splendid things use enjoy, find nothing dawdle, instead man ought be, only...” stopped, look pain pity it. “Saint Laurence gridiron,” added Laurie, blandly finishing sentence. But lecture began take effect, wide-awake sparkle eyes half-angry, half-injured expression replaced former indifference. “I supposed would take so. You men tell us angels, say make will, instant honestly try good, laugh us listen, proves much flattery worth.” Amy spoke bitterly, turned back exasperating martyr feet. In minute hand came page, could draw, Laurie’s voice said, droll imitation penitent child, “I good, oh, I good!” But Amy laugh, earnest, tapping outspread hand pencil, said soberly, “Are ashamed hand like that? It soft white woman’s, looks never anything wear Jouvin’s best gloves pick flowers ladies. You dandy, thank Heaven, I glad see diamonds big seal rings it, little old one Jo gave long ago. Dear soul, I wish help me!” “So I!” The hand vanished suddenly came, energy enough echo wish suit even Amy. She glanced new thought mind, lying hat half face, shade, mustache hid mouth. She saw chest rise fall, long breath might sigh, hand wore ring nestled grass, hide something precious tender spoken of. All minute various hints trifles assumed shape significance Amy’s mind, told sister never confided her. She remembered Laurie never spoke voluntarily Jo, recalled shadow face now, change character, wearing little old ring ornament handsome hand. Girls quick read signs feel eloquence. Amy fancied perhaps love trouble bottom alteration, sure it. Her keen eyes filled, spoke again, voice could beautifully soft kind chose make so. “I know I right talk you, Laurie, sweetest-tempered fellow world, would angry me. But fond proud you, I could bear think disappointed home I been, though, perhaps would understand change better I do.” “I think would,” came hat, grim tone, quite touching broken one. “They ought told me, let go blundering scolding, I kind patient ever. I never like Miss Randal I hate her!” said artful Amy, wishing sure facts time. “Hang Miss Randal!” Laurie knocked hat face look left doubt sentiments toward young lady. “I beg pardon, I thought...” paused diplomatically. “No, not, knew perfectly well I never cared anyone Jo,” Laurie said old, impetuous tone, turned face away spoke. “I think so, never said anything it, came away, I supposed I mistaken. And Jo would kind you? Why, I sure loved dearly.” “She kind, right way, lucky love me, I good-for-nothing fellow think me. It fault though, may tell so.” The hard, bitter look came back said that, troubled Amy, know balm apply. “I wrong, I know. I sorry I cross, I cannot help wishing would bear better, Teddy, dear.” “Do not, name me!” Laurie put hand quick gesture stop words spoken Jo’s half-kind, half-reproachful tone. “Wait till tried yourself,” added low voice, pulled grass handful. “I would take manfully, respected I could loved,” said Amy, decision one knew nothing it. Now, Laurie flattered borne remarkably well, making moan, asking sympathy, taking trouble away live alone. Amy’s lecture put matter new light, first time look weak selfish lose heart first failure, shut moody indifference. He felt suddenly shaken pensive dream found impossible go sleep again. Presently sat asked slowly, “Do think Jo would despise do?” “Yes, saw now. She hates lazy people. Why something splendid, make love you?” “I best, use.” “Graduating well, mean? That ought done, grandfather’s sake. It would shameful fail spending much time money, everyone knew could well.” “I fail, say will, Jo would love me,” began Laurie, leaning head hand despondent attitude. “No, not, say end, good, proved could something tried. If would set another task sort, would soon hearty, happy self again, forget trouble.” “That impossible.” “Try see. You need shrug shoulders, think, ‘Much knows things’. I pretend wise, I observing, I see great deal would imagine. I interested people’s experiences inconsistencies, though I cannot explain, I remember use benefit. Love Jo days, choose, let spoil you, wicked throw away many good gifts cannot one want. There, I lecture more, I know wake man spite hardhearted girl.” Neither spoke several minutes. Laurie sat turning little ring finger, Amy put last touches hasty sketch working talked. Presently put knee, merely saying, “How like that?” He looked smiled, could well help doing, capitally done, long, lazy figure grass, listless face, half-shut eyes, one hand holding cigar, came little wreath smoke encircled dreamer’s head. “How well draw!” said, genuine surprise pleasure skill, adding, half-laugh, “Yes, me.” “As are. This were.” Amy laid another sketch beside one held. It nearly well done, life spirit atoned many faults, recalled past vividly sudden change swept young man’s face looked. Only rough sketch Laurie taming horse. Hat coat off, every line active figure, resolute face, commanding attitude full energy meaning. The handsome brute, subdued, stood arching neck tightly drawn rein, one foot impatiently pawing ground, ears pricked listening voice mastered him. In ruffled mane, rider’s breezy hair erect attitude, suggestion suddenly arrested motion, strength, courage, youthful buoyancy contrasted sharply supine grace ‘_Dolce far Niente_’ sketch. Laurie said nothing eye went one other, Amy saw flush fold lips together read accepted little lesson given him. That satisfied her, without waiting speak, said, sprightly way... “Do remember day played Rarey Puck, looked on? Meg Beth frightened, Jo clapped pranced, I sat fence drew you. I found sketch portfolio day, touched up, kept show you.” “Much obliged. You improved immensely since then, I congratulate you. May I venture suggest ‘a honeymoon paradise’ five clock dinner hour hotel?” Laurie rose spoke, returned pictures smile bow looked watch, remind even moral lectures end. He tried resume former easy, indifferent air, affectation now, rousing effacious would confess. Amy felt shade coldness manner, said herself... “Now, I offended him. Well, good, I glad, makes hate me, I sorry, true, I cannot take back word it.” They laughed chatted way home, little Baptiste, behind, thought monsieur madamoiselle charming spirits. But felt ill ease. The friendly frankness disturbed, sunshine shadow it, despite apparent gaiety, secret discontent heart each. “Shall see evening, mon frere?” asked Amy, parted aunt’s door. “Unfortunately I engagement. Au revoir, madamoiselle,” Laurie bent kiss hand, foreign fashion, became better many men. Something face made Amy say quickly warmly... “No, me, Laurie, part good old way. I would rather hearty English handshake sentimental salutations France.” “Goodbye, dear,” words, uttered tone liked, Laurie left her, handshake almost painful heartiness. Next morning, instead usual call, Amy received note made smile beginning sigh end. My Dear Mentor, Please make adieux aunt, exult within yourself, ‘Lazy Laurence’ gone grandpa, like best boys. A pleasant winter you, may gods grant blissful honeymoon Valrosa! I think Fred would benefited rouser. Tell so, congratulations. Yours gratefully, Telemachus “Good boy! I glad gone,” said Amy, approving smile. The next minute face fell glanced empty room, adding, involuntary sigh, “Yes, I glad, I shall miss him.” CHAPTER FORTY THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW When first bitterness over, family accepted inevitable, tried bear cheerfully, helping one another increased affection comes bind households tenderly together times trouble. They put away grief, part toward making last year happy one. The pleasantest room house set apart Beth, gathered everything loved, flowers, pictures, piano, little worktable, beloved pussies. Father’s best books found way there, Mother’s easy chair, Jo’s desk, Amy’s finest sketches, every day Meg brought babies loving pilgrimage, make sunshine Aunty Beth. John quietly set apart little sum, might enjoy pleasure keeping invalid supplied fruit loved longed for. Old Hannah never wearied concocting dainty dishes tempt capricious appetite, dropping tears worked, across sea came little gifts cheerful letters, seeming bring breaths warmth fragrance lands know winter. Here, cherished like household saint shrine, sat Beth, tranquil busy ever, nothing could change sweet, unselfish nature, even preparing leave life, tried make happier remain behind. The feeble fingers never idle, one pleasures make little things school children daily passing fro, drop pair mittens window pair purple hands, needlebook small mother many dolls, penwipers young penmen toiling forests pothooks, scrapbooks picture-loving eyes, manner pleasant devices, till reluctant climbers ladder learning found way strewn flowers, were, came regard gentle giver sort fairy godmother, sat there, showered gifts miraculously suited tastes needs. If Beth wanted reward, found bright little faces always turned window, nods smiles, droll little letters came her, full blots gratitude. The first months happy ones, Beth often used look round, say “How beautiful is!” sat together sunny room, babies kicking crowing floor, mother sisters working near, father reading, pleasant voice, wise old books seemed rich good comfortable words, applicable written centuries ago, little chapel, paternal priest taught flock hard lessons must learn, trying show hope comfort love, faith make resignation possible. Simple sermons, went straight souls listened, father’s heart minister’s religion, frequent falter voice gave double eloquence words spoke read. It well peaceful time given preparation sad hours come, by-and-by, Beth said needle ‘so heavy’, put forever. Talking wearied her, faces troubled her, pain claimed own, tranquil spirit sorrowfully perturbed ills vexed feeble flesh. Ah me! Such heavy days, long, long nights, aching hearts imploring prayers, loved best forced see thin hands stretched beseechingly, hear bitter cry, “Help me, help me!” feel help. A sad eclipse serene soul, sharp struggle young life death, mercifully brief, natural rebellion over, old peace returned beautiful ever. With wreck frail body, Beth’s soul grew strong, though said little, felt ready, saw first pilgrim called likewise fittest, waited shore, trying see Shining Ones coming receive crossed river. Jo never left hour since Beth said “I feel stronger here.” She slept couch room, waking often renew fire, feed, lift, wait upon patient creature seldom asked anything, ‘tried trouble’. All day haunted room, jealous nurse, prouder chosen honor life ever brought her. Precious helpful hours Jo, heart received teaching needed. Lessons patience sweetly taught could fail learn them, charity all, lovely spirit forgive truly forget unkindness, loyalty duty makes hardest easy, sincere faith fears nothing, trusts undoubtingly. Often woke Jo found Beth reading well-worn little book, heard singing softly, beguile sleepless night, saw lean face upon hands, slow tears dropped transparent fingers, Jo would lie watching thoughts deep tears, feeling Beth, simple, unselfish way, trying wean dear old life, fit life come, sacred words comfort, quiet prayers, music loved well. Seeing Jo wisest sermons, saintliest hymns, fervent prayers voice could utter. For eyes made clear many tears, heart softened tenderest sorrow, recognized beauty sister’s life—uneventful, unambitious, yet full genuine virtues ‘smell sweet, blossom dust’, self-forgetfulness makes humblest earth remembered soonest heaven, true success possible all. One night Beth looked among books upon table, find something make forget mortal weariness almost hard bear pain, turned leaves old favorite, Pilgrims’s Progress, found little paper, scribbled Jo’s hand. The name caught eye blurred look lines made sure tears fallen it. “Poor Jo! She fast asleep, I wake ask leave. She shows things, I think mind I look this”, thought Beth, glance sister, lay rug, tongs beside her, ready wake minute log fell apart. MY BETH Sitting patient shadow Till blessed light shall come, A serene saintly presence Sanctifies troubled home. Earthly joys hopes sorrows Break like ripples strand Of deep solemn river Where willing feet stand. O sister, passing me, Out human care strife, Leave me, gift, virtues Which beautified life. Dear, bequeath great patience Which power sustain A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit In prison-house pain. Give me, I need sorely, Of courage, wise sweet, Which made path duty Green beneath willing feet. Give unselfish nature, That charity divine Can pardon wrong love’s dear sake— Meek heart, forgive mine! Thus parting daily loseth Something bitter pain, And learning hard lesson, My great loss becomes gain. For touch grief render My wild nature serene, Give life new aspirations, A new trust unseen. Henceforth, safe across river, I shall see forever A beloved, household spirit Waiting shore. Hope faith, born sorrow, Guardian angels shall become, And sister gone By hands shall lead home. Blurred blotted, faulty feeble lines were, brought look inexpressible comfort Beth’s face, one regret done little, seemed assure life useless, death would bring despair feared. As sat paper folded hands, charred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived blaze, crept bedside, hoping Beth slept. “Not asleep, happy, dear. See, I found read it. I knew would care. Have I you, Jo?” asked, wistful, humble earnestness. “_Oh_, Beth, much, much!” Jo’s head went upon pillow beside sister’s. “Then I feel I would wasted life. I good make me, I tried right. And now, late begin even better, comfort know someone loves much, feels I would helped them.” “More one world, Beth. I used think I could let go, I learning feel I lose you, ever, death cannot part us, though seems to.” “I know cannot, I fear longer, I sure I shall Beth still, love help ever. You must take place, Jo, everything Father Mother I gone. They turn you, fail them, hard work alone, remember I forget you, happier writing splendid books seeing world, love thing carry us go, makes end easy.” “I try, Beth.” Jo renounced old ambition, pledged new better one, acknowledging poverty desires, feeling blessed solace belief immortality love. So spring days came went, sky grew clearer, earth greener, flowers fairly early, birds came back time say goodbye Beth, who, like tired trustful child, clung hands led life, Father Mother guided tenderly Valley Shadow, gave God. Seldom except books dying utter memorable words, see visions, depart beatified countenances, sped many parting souls know end comes naturally simply sleep. As Beth hoped, ‘tide went easily’, dark hour dawn, bosom drawn first breath, quietly drew last, farewell one loving look, one little sigh. With tears prayers tender hands, Mother sisters made ready long sleep pain would never mar again, seeing grateful eyes beautiful serenity soon replaced pathetic patience wrung hearts long, feeling reverent joy darling death benignant angel, phantom full dread. When morning came, first time many months fire out, Jo’s place empty, room still. But bird sang blithely budding bough, close by, snowdrops blossomed freshly window, spring sunshine streamed like benediction placid face upon pillow, face full painless peace loved best smiled tears, thanked God Beth well last. CHAPTER FORTY-ONE LEARNING TO FORGET Amy’s lecture Laurie good, though, course, till long afterward. Men seldom do, women advisers, lords creation take advice till persuaded intended do. Then act upon it, and, succeeds, give weaker vessel half credit it. If fails, generously give whole. Laurie went back grandfather, dutifully devoted several weeks old gentleman declared climate Nice improved wonderfully, better try again. There nothing young gentleman would liked better, elephants could dragged back scolding received. Pride forbid, whenever longing grew strong, fortified resolution repeating words made deepest impression—“I despise you.” “Go something splendid make love you.” Laurie turned matter mind often soon brought confess selfish lazy, man great sorrow, indulged sorts vagaries till lived down. He felt blighted affections quite dead now, though never cease faithful mourner, occasion wear weeds ostentatiously. Jo would love him, might make respect admire something prove girl’s ‘No’ spoiled life. He always meant something, Amy’s advice quite unnecessary. He waiting till aforesaid blighted affections decently interred. That done, felt ready ‘hide stricken heart, still toil on’. As Goethe, joy grief, put song, Laurie resolved embalm love sorrow music, compose Requiem harrow Jo’s soul melt heart every hearer. Therefore next time old gentleman found getting restless moody ordered off, went Vienna, musical friends, fell work firm determination distinguish himself. But whether sorrow vast embodied music, music ethereal uplift mortal woe, soon discovered Requiem beyond present. It evident mind working order yet, ideas needed clarifying, often middle plaintive strain, would find humming dancing tune vividly recalled Christmas ball Nice, especially stout Frenchman, put effectual stop tragic composition time being. Then tried opera, nothing seemed impossible beginning, unforeseen difficulties beset him. He wanted Jo heroine, called upon memory supply tender recollections romantic visions love. But memory turned traitor, possessed perverse spirit girl, would recall Jo’s oddities, faults, freaks, would show unsentimental aspects—beating mats head tied bandanna, barricading sofa pillow, throwing cold water passion la Gummidge—and irresistable laugh spoiled pensive picture endeavoring paint. Jo would put opera price, give “Bless girl, torment is!” clutch hair, became distracted composer. When looked another less intractable damsel immortalize melody, memory produced one obliging readiness. This phantom wore many faces, always golden hair, enveloped diaphanous cloud, floated airily mind’s eye pleasing chaos roses, peacocks, white ponies, blue ribbons. He give complacent wraith name, took heroine grew quite fond her, well might, gifted every gift grace sun, escorted her, unscathed, trials would annihilated mortal woman. Thanks inspiration, got swimmingly time, gradually work lost charm, forgot compose, sat musing, pen hand, roamed gay city get new ideas refresh mind, seemed somewhat unsettled state winter. He much, thought great deal conscious change sort going spite himself. “It genius simmering, perhaps. I let simmer, see comes it,” said, secret suspicion genius, something far common. Whatever was, simmered purpose, grew discontented desultory life, began long real earnest work go at, soul body, finally came wise conclusion everyone loved music composer. Returning one Mozart’s grand operas, splendidly performed Royal Theatre, looked own, played best parts, sat staring busts Mendelssohn, Beethoven, Bach, stared benignly back again. Then suddenly tore music sheets, one one, last fluttered hand, said soberly himself... “She right! Talent genius, cannot make so. That music taken vanity Rome took her, I humbug longer. Now shall I do?” That seemed hard question answer, Laurie began wish work daily bread. Now ever, occurred eligible opportunity ‘going devil’, forcibly expressed it, plenty money nothing do, Satan proverbially fond providing employment full idle hands. The poor fellow temptations enough without within, withstood pretty well, much valued liberty, valued good faith confidence more, promise grandfather, desire able look honestly eyes women loved him, say “All’s well,” kept safe steady. Very likely Mrs. Grundy observe, “I believe it, boys boys, young men must sow wild oats, women must expect miracles.” I dare say not, Mrs. Grundy, true nevertheless. Women work good many miracles, I persuasion may perform even raising standard manhood refusing echo sayings. Let boys boys, longer better, let young men sow wild oats must. But mothers, sisters, friends may help make crop small one, keep many tares spoiling harvest, believing, showing believe, possibility loyalty virtues make men manliest good women’s eyes. If feminine delusion, leave us enjoy may, without half beauty romance life lost, sorrowful forebodings would embitter hopes brave, tenderhearted little lads, still love mothers better ashamed it. Laurie thought task forgetting love Jo would absorb powers years, great surprise discovered grew easier every day. He refused believe first, got angry himself, could understand it, hearts curious contrary things, time nature work spite us. Laurie’s heart would ache. The wound persisted healing rapidity astonished him, instead trying forget, found trying remember. He foreseen turn affairs, prepared it. He disgusted himself, surprised fickleness, full queer mixture disappointment relief could recover tremendous blow soon. He carefully stirred embers lost love, refused burst blaze. There comfortable glow warmed good without putting fever, reluctantly obliged confess boyish passion slowly subsiding tranquil sentiment, tender, little sad resentful still, sure pass away time, leaving brotherly affection would last unbroken end. As word ‘brotherly’ passed mind one reveries, smiled, glanced picture Mozart him... “Well, great man, could one sister took other, happy.” Laurie utter words, thought them, next instant kissed little old ring, saying himself, “No, I not! I forgotten, I never can. I try again, fails, then...” Leaving sentence unfinished, seized pen paper wrote Jo, telling could settle anything least hope changing mind. Could she, would she—and let come home happy? While waiting answer nothing, energetically, fever impatience. It came last, settled mind effectually one point, Jo decidedly could would not. She wrapped Beth, never wished hear word love again. Then begged happy somebody else, always keep little corner heart loving sister Jo. In postscript desired tell Amy Beth worse, coming home spring need saddening remainder stay. That would time enough, please God, Laurie must write often, let feel lonely, homesick anxious. “So I will, once. Poor little girl, sad going home her, I afraid,” Laurie opened desk, writing Amy proper conclusion sentence left unfinished weeks before. But write letter day, rummaged best paper, came across something changed purpose. Tumbling one part desk among bills, passports, business documents various kinds several Jo’s letters, another compartment three notes Amy, carefully tied one blue ribbons sweetly suggestive little dead roses put away inside. With half-repentant, half-amused expression, Laurie gathered Jo’s letters, smoothed, folded, put neatly small drawer desk, stood minute turning ring thoughtfully finger, slowly drew off, laid letters, locked drawer, went hear High Mass Saint Stefan’s, feeling funeral, though overwhelmed affliction, seemed proper way spend rest day writing letters charming young ladies. The letter went soon, however, promptly answered, Amy homesick, confessed delightfully confiding manner. The correspondence flourished famously, letters flew fro unfailing regularity early spring. Laurie sold busts, made allumettes opera, went back Paris, hoping somebody would arrive long. He wanted desperately go Nice, would till asked, Amy would ask him, little experiences own, made rather wish avoid quizzical eyes ‘our boy’. Fred Vaughn returned, put question decided answer, “Yes, thank you,” said, “No, thank you,” kindly steadily, time came, courage failed her, found something money position needed satisfy new longing filled heart full tender hopes fears. The words, “Fred good fellow, man I fancied would ever like,” Laurie’s face uttered them, kept returning pertinaciously said look, words, “I shall marry money.” It troubled remember now, wished could take back, sounded unwomanly. She want Laurie think heartless, worldly creature. She care queen society half much lovable woman. She glad hate dreadful things said, took beautifully kinder ever. His letters comfort, home letters irregular half satisfactory come. It pleasure, duty answer them, poor fellow forlorn, needed petting, since Jo persisted stonyhearted. She ought made effort tried love him. It could hard, many people would proud glad dear boy care them. But Jo never would act like girls, nothing kind treat like brother. If brothers treated well Laurie period, would much happier race beings are. Amy never lectured now. She asked opinion subjects, interested everything did, made charming little presents him, sent two letters week, full lively gossip, sisterly confidences, captivating sketches lovely scenes her. As brothers complimented letters carried sister’s pockets, read reread diligently, cried short, kissed long, treasured carefully, hint Amy fond foolish things. But certainly grow little pale pensive spring, lost much relish society, went sketching alone good deal. She never much show came home, studying nature, I dare say, sat hours, hands folded, terrace Valrosa, absently sketched fancy occurred her, stalwart knight carved tomb, young man asleep grass, hat eyes, curly haired girl gorgeous array, promenading ballroom arm tall gentleman, faces left blur according last fashion art, safe altogether satisfactory. Her aunt thought regretted answer Fred, finding denials useless explanations impossible, Amy left think liked, taking care Laurie know Fred gone Egypt. That all, understood it, looked relieved, said himself, venerable air... “I sure would think better it. Poor old fellow! I all, I sympathize.” With heaved great sigh, then, discharged duty past, put feet sofa enjoyed Amy’s letter luxuriously. While changes going abroad, trouble come home. But letter telling Beth failing never reached Amy, next found grass green sister. The sad news met Vevay, heat driven Nice May, travelled slowly Switzerland, way Genoa Italian lakes. She bore well, quietly submitted family decree shorten visit, since late say goodbye Beth, better stay, let absence soften sorrow. But heart heavy, longed home, every day looked wistfully across lake, waiting Laurie come comfort her. He come soon, mail brought letters both, Germany, took days reach him. The moment read it, packed knapsack, bade adieu fellow pedestrians, keep promise, heart full joy sorrow, hope suspense. He knew Vevay well, soon boat touched little quay, hurried along shore La Tour, Carrols living en pension. The garcon despair whole family gone take promenade lake, no, blonde mademoiselle might chateau garden. If monsieur would give pain sitting down, flash time present her. But monsieur could wait even ‘flash time’, middle speech departed find mademoiselle himself. A pleasant old garden borders lovely lake, chestnuts rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, black shadow tower falling far across sunny water. At one corner wide, low wall seat, Amy often came read work, console beauty her. She sitting day, leaning head hand, homesick heart heavy eyes, thinking Beth wondering Laurie come. She hear cross courtyard beyond, see pause archway led subterranean path garden. He stood minute looking new eyes, seeing one ever seen before, tender side Amy’s character. Everything mutely suggested love sorrow, blotted letters lap, black ribbon tied hair, womanly pain patience face, even little ebony cross throat seemed pathetic Laurie, given her, wore ornament. If doubts reception would give him, set rest minute looked saw him, dropping everything, ran him, exclaiming tone unmistakable love longing... “Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew would come me!” I think everything said settled then, stood together quite silent moment, dark head bent protectingly light one, Amy felt one could comfort sustain well Laurie, Laurie decided Amy woman world could fill Jo’s place make happy. He tell so, disappointed, felt truth, satisfied, gladly left rest silence. In minute Amy went back place, dried tears, Laurie gathered scattered papers, finding sight sundry well-worn letters suggestive sketches good omens future. As sat beside her, Amy felt shy again, turned rosy red recollection impulsive greeting. “I could help it, I felt lonely sad, glad see you. It surprise look find you, I beginning fear would come,” said, trying vain speak quite naturally. “I came minute I heard. I wish I could say something comfort loss dear little Beth, I feel, and...” He could get further, turned bashful sudden, quite know say. He longed lay Amy’s head shoulder, tell good cry, dare, took hand instead, gave sympathetic squeeze better words. “You need say anything, comforts me,” said softly. “Beth well happy, I must wish back, I dread going home, much I long see all. We talk now, makes cry, I want enjoy stay. You need go right back, need you?” “Not want me, dear.” “I do, much. Aunt Flo kind, seem like one family, would comfortable little while.” Amy spoke looked like homesick child whose heart full Laurie forgot bashfulness once, gave wanted—the petting used cheerful conversation needed. “Poor little soul, look would grieved half sick! I going take care you, cry more, come walk me, wind chilly sit still,” said, half-caressing, half-commanding way Amy liked, tied hat, drew arm his, began pace sunny walk new-leaved chestnuts. He felt ease upon legs, Amy found pleasant strong arm lean upon, familiar face smile her, kind voice talk delightfully alone. The quaint old garden sheltered many pairs lovers, seemed expressly made them, sunny secluded it, nothing tower overlook them, wide lake carry away echo words, rippled below. For hour new pair walked talked, rested wall, enjoying sweet influences gave charm time place, unromantic dinner bell warned away, Amy felt left burden loneliness sorrow behind chateau garden. The moment Mrs. Carrol saw girl’s altered face, illuminated new idea, exclaimed herself, “Now I understand all—the child pining young Laurence. Bless heart, I never thought thing!” With praiseworthy discretion, good lady said nothing, betrayed sign enlightenment, cordially urged Laurie stay begged Amy enjoy society, would good much solitude. Amy model docility, aunt good deal occupied Flo, left entertain friend, usual success. At Nice, Laurie lounged Amy scolded. At Vevay, Laurie never idle, always walking, riding, boating, studying energetic manner, Amy admired everything followed example far fast could. He said change owing climate, contradict him, glad like excuse recovered health spirits. The invigorating air good, much exercise worked wholesome changes minds well bodies. They seemed get clearer views life duty among everlasting hills. The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, moody mists. The warm spring sunshine brought sorts aspiring ideas, tender hopes, happy thoughts. The lake seemed wash away troubles past, grand old mountains look benignly upon saying, “Little children, love one another.” In spite new sorrow, happy time, happy Laurie could bear disturb word. It took little recover surprise cure first, firmly believed, last love. He consoled seeming disloyalty thought Jo’s sister almost Jo’s self, conviction would impossible love woman Amy soon well. His first wooing tempestuous order, looked back upon long vista years feeling compassion blended regret. He ashamed it, put away one bitter-sweet experiences life, could grateful pain over. His second wooing, resolved, calm simple possible. There need scene, hardly need telling Amy loved her, knew without words given answer long ago. It came naturally one could complain, knew everybody would pleased, even Jo. But first little passion crushed, apt wary slow making second trial, Laurie let days pass, enjoying every hour, leaving chance utterance word would put end first sweetest part new romance. He rather imagined denoument would take place chateau garden moonlight, graceful decorous manner, turned exactly reverse, matter settled lake noonday blunt words. They floating morning, gloomy St. Gingolf sunny Montreux, Alps Savoy one side, Mont St. Bernard Dent du Midi other, pretty Vevay valley, Lausanne upon hill beyond, cloudless blue sky overhead, bluer lake below, dotted picturesque boats look like white-winged gulls. They talking Bonnivard, glided past Chillon, Rousseau, looked Clarens, wrote Heloise. Neither read it, knew love story, privately wondered half interesting own. Amy dabbling hand water little pause fell them, looked up, Laurie leaning oars expression eyes made say hastily, merely sake saying something... “You must tired. Rest little, let row. It good, since came I altogether lazy luxurious.” “I tired, may take oar, like. There room enough, though I sit nearly middle, else boat trim,” returned Laurie, rather liked arrangement. Feeling mended matters much, Amy took offered third seat, shook hair face, accepted oar. She rowed well many things, though used hands, Laurie one, oars kept time, boat went smoothly water. “How well pull together, we?” said Amy, objected silence then. “So well I wish might always pull boat. Will you, Amy?” tenderly. “Yes, Laurie,” low. Then stopped rowing, unconsciously added pretty little tableau human love happiness dissolving views reflected lake. CHAPTER FORTY-TWO ALL ALONE It easy promise self-abnegation self wrapped another, heart soul purified sweet example. But helpful voice silent, daily lesson over, beloved presence gone, nothing remained loneliness grief, Jo found promise hard keep. How could ‘comfort Father Mother’ heart ached ceaseless longing sister, could ‘make house cheerful’ light warmth beauty seemed deserted Beth left old home new, world could ‘find useful, happy work do’, would take place loving service reward? She tried blind, hopeless way duty, secretly rebelling while, seemed unjust joys lessened, burdens made heavier, life get harder harder toiled along. Some people seemed get sunshine, shadow. It fair, tried Amy good, never got reward, disappointment, trouble hard work. Poor Jo, dark days her, something like despair came thought spending life quiet house, devoted humdrum cares, small pleasures, duty never seemed grow easier. “I cannot it. I meant life like this, I know I shall break away something desperate somebody come help me,” said herself, first efforts failed fell moody, miserable state mind often comes strong wills yield inevitable. But someone come help her, though Jo recognize good angels wore familiar shapes used simple spells best fitted poor humanity. Often started night, thinking Beth called her, sight little empty bed made cry bitter cry unsubmissive sorrow, “Oh, Beth, come back! Come back!” stretch yearning arms vain. For, quick hear sobbing hear sister’s faintest whisper, mother came comfort her, words only, patient tenderness soothes touch, tears mute reminders greater grief Jo’s, broken whispers, eloquent prayers, hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand natural sorrow. Sacred moments, heart talked heart silence night, turning affliction blessing, chastened grief strengthened love. Feeling this, Jo’s burden seemed easier bear, duty grew sweeter, life looked endurable, seen safe shelter mother’s arms. When aching heart little comforted, troubled mind likewise found help, one day went study, leaning good gray head lifted welcome tranquil smile, said humbly, “Father, talk Beth. I need did, I wrong.” “My dear, nothing comfort like this,” answered, falter voice, arms round her, too, needed help, fear ask it. Then, sitting Beth’s little chair close beside him, Jo told troubles, resentful sorrow loss, fruitless efforts discouraged her, want faith made life look dark, sad bewilderment call despair. She gave entire confidence, gave help needed, found consolation act. For time come could talk together father daughter, man woman, able glad serve mutual sympathy well mutual love. Happy, thoughtful times old study Jo called ‘the church one member’, came fresh courage, recovered cheerfulness, submissive spirit. For parents taught one child meet death without fear, trying teach another accept life without despondency distrust, use beautiful opportunities gratitude power. Other helps Jo—humble, wholesome duties delights would denied part serving her, slowly learned see value. Brooms dishcloths never could distasteful been, Beth presided both, something housewifely spirit seemed linger around little mop old brush, never thrown away. As used them, Jo found humming songs Beth used hum, imitating Beth’s orderly ways, giving little touches kept everything fresh cozy, first step toward making home happy, though know till Hannah said approving squeeze hand... “You thoughtful creeter, determined shall miss dear lamb ef help it. We say much, see it, Lord bless for’t, see ef He not.” As sat sewing together, Jo discovered much improved sister Meg was, well could talk, much knew good, womanly impulses, thoughts, feelings, happy husband children, much other. “Marriage excellent thing, all. I wonder I blossom half well have, I tried it?, always _‘perwisin’_ I could,” said Jo, constructed kite Demi topsy-turvy nursery. “It need bring tender womanly half nature, Jo. You like chestnut burr, prickly outside, silky-soft within, sweet kernal, one get it. Love make show heart one day, rough burr fall off.” “Frost opens chestnut burrs, madam, takes good shake bring down. Boys go nutting, I care bagged them,” returned Jo, pasting away kite wind blows would ever carry up, Daisy tied bob. Meg laughed, glad see glimmer Jo’s old spirit, felt duty enforce opinion every argument power, sisterly chats wasted, especially two Meg’s effective arguments babies, Jo loved tenderly. Grief best opener hearts, Jo’s nearly ready bag. A little sunshine ripen nut, then, boy’s impatient shake, man’s hand reached pick gently burr, find kernal sound sweet. If suspected this, would shut tight, prickly ever, fortunately thinking herself, time came, dropped. Now, heroine moral storybook, ought period life become quite saintly, renounced world, gone good mortified bonnet, tracts pocket. But, see, Jo heroine, struggling human girl like hundreds others, acted nature, sad, cross, listless, energetic, mood suggested. It highly virtuous say good, cannot once, takes long pull, strong pull, pull together us even get feet set right way. Jo got far, learning duty, feel unhappy not, cheerfully, ah, another thing! She often said wanted something splendid, matter hard, wish, could beautiful devote life Father Mother, trying make home happy her? And difficulties necessary increase splendor effort, could harder restless, ambitious girl give hopes, plans, desires, cheerfully live others? Providence taken word. Here task, expected, better self part it. Now, could it? She decided would try, first attempt found helps I suggested. Still another given her, took it, reward, comfort, Christian took refreshment afforded little arbor rested, climbed hill called Difficulty. “Why write? That always used make happy,” said mother once, desponding fit over-shadowed Jo. “I heart write, I had, nobody cares things.” “We do. Write something us, never mind rest world. Try it, dear. I sure would good, please us much.” “Do believe I can.” But Jo got desk began overhaul half-finished manuscripts. An hour afterward mother peeped was, scratching away, black pinafore on, absorbed expression, caused Mrs. March smile slip away, well pleased success suggestion. Jo never knew happened, something got story went straight hearts read it, family laughed cried it, father sent it, much will, one popular magazines, utter surprise, paid for, others requested. Letters several persons, whose praise honor, followed appearance little story, newspapers copied it, strangers well friends admired it. For small thing great success, Jo astonished novel commended condemned once. “I understand it. What simple little story like make people praise so?” said, quite bewildered. “There truth it, Jo, secret. Humor pathos make alive, found style last. You wrote thoughts fame money, put heart it, daughter. You bitter, comes sweet. Do best, grow happy success.” “If anything good true I write, mine. I owe Mother Beth,” said Jo, touched father’s words amount praise world. So taught love sorrow, Jo wrote little stories, sent away make friends her, finding charitable world humble wanderers, kindly welcomed, sent home comfortable tokens mother, like dutiful children good fortune overtakes. When Amy Laurie wrote engagement, Mrs. March feared Jo would find difficult rejoice it, fears soon set rest, though Jo looked grave first, took quietly, full hopes plans ‘the children’ read letter twice. It sort written duet, wherein glorified loverlike fashion, pleasant read satisfactory think of, one objection make. “You like it, Mother?” said Jo, laid closely written sheets looked one another. “Yes, I hoped would so, ever since Amy wrote refused Fred. I felt sure something better call ‘mercenary spirit’ come her, hint letters made suspect love Laurie would win day.” “How sharp are, Marmee, silent! You never said word me.” “Mothers need sharp eyes discreet tongues girls manage. I half afraid put idea head, lest write congratulate thing settled.” “I scatterbrain I was. You may trust me. I sober sensible enough anyone’s confidante now.” “So are, dear, I made mine, I fancied might pain learn Teddy loved someone else.” “Now, Mother, really think I could silly selfish, I would refused love, freshest, best?” “I knew sincere then, Jo, lately I thought came back, asked again, might perhaps, feel like giving another answer. Forgive me, dear, I cannot help seeing lonely, sometimes hungry look eyes goes heart. So I fancied boy might fill empty place tried now.” “No, Mother, better is, I glad Amy learned love him. But right one thing. I lonely, perhaps Teddy tried again, I might said ‘Yes’, I love more, I care loved went away.” “I glad that, Jo, shows getting on. There plenty love you, try satisfied Father Mother, sisters brothers, friends babies, till best lover comes give reward.” “Mothers best lovers world, I mind whispering Marmee I would like try kinds. It curious, I try satisfy sorts natural affections, I seem want. I would idea hearts could take many. Mine elastic, never seems full now, I used quite contented family. I understand it.” “I do,” Mrs. March smiled wise smile, Jo turned back leaves read Amy said Laurie. “It beautiful loved Laurie loves me. He sentimental, say much it, I see feel says does, makes happy humble I seem girl I was. I never knew good generous tender till now, let us read heart, I find full noble impulses hopes purposes, proud know mine. He says feels ‘could make prosperous voyage aboard mate, lots love ballast’. I pray may, try believes me, I love gallant captain heart soul might, never desert him, God let us us together. Oh, Mother, I never knew much like heaven world could be, two people love live one another!” “And cool, reserved, worldly Amy! Truly, love work miracles. How very, happy must be!” Jo laid rustling sheets together careful hand, one might shut covers lovely romance, holds reader fast till end comes, finds alone workaday world again. By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, rainy, could walk. A restless spirit possessed her, old feeling came again, bitter was, sorrowfully patient wonder one sister asked, nothing. It true, knew tried put away, natural craving affection strong, Amy’s happiness woke hungry longing someone ‘love heart soul, cling God let together’. Up garret, Jo’s unquiet wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests row, marked owners name, filled relics childhood girlhood ended all. Jo glanced them, came own, leaned chin edge, stared absently chaotic collection, till bundle old exercise books caught eye. She drew out, turned over, relived pleasant winter kind Mrs. Kirke’s. She smiled first, looked thoughtful, next sad, came little message written Professor’s hand, lips began tremble, books slid lap, sat looking friendly words, took new meaning, touched tender spot heart. “Wait me, friend. I may little late, I shall surely come.” “Oh, would! So kind, good, patient always, dear old Fritz. I value half enough I him, I love see him, everyone seems going away me, I alone.” And holding little paper fast, promise yet fulfilled, Jo laid head comfortable rag bag, cried, opposition rain pattering roof. Was self-pity, loneliness, low spirits? Or waking sentiment bided time patiently inspirer? Who shall say? CHAPTER FORTY-THREE SURPRISES Jo alone twilight, lying old sofa, looking fire, thinking. It favorite way spending hour dusk. No one disturbed her, used lie Beth’s little red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, thinking tender thoughts sister never seemed far away. Her face looked tired, grave, rather sad, tomorrow birthday, thinking fast years went by, old getting, little seemed accomplished. Almost twenty-five, nothing show it. Jo mistaken that. There good deal show, by-and-by saw, grateful it. “An old maid, I be. A literary spinster, pen spouse, family stories children, twenty years hence morsel fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, I old cannot enjoy it, solitary, cannot share it, independent, need it. Well, I need sour saint selfish sinner, and, I dare say, old maids comfortable get used it, but...” Jo sighed, prospect inviting. It seldom is, first, thirty seems end things five-and-twenty. But bad looks, one get quite happily one something one’s self fall back upon. At twenty-five, girls begin talk old maids, secretly resolve never be. At thirty say nothing it, quietly accept fact, sensible, console remembering twenty useful, happy years, may learning grow old gracefully. Do laugh spinsters, dear girls, often tender, tragic romances hidden away hearts beat quietly sober gowns, many silent sacrifices youth, health, ambition, love itself, make faded faces beautiful God’s sight. Even sad, sour sisters kindly dealt with, missed sweetest part life, reason. And looking compassion, contempt, girls bloom remember may miss blossom time. That rosy cheeks last forever, silver threads come bonnie brown hair, that, by-and-by, kindness respect sweet love admiration now. Gentlemen, means boys, courteous old maids, matter poor plain prim, chivalry worth readiest pay deference old, protect feeble, serve womankind, regardless rank, age, color. Just recollect good aunts lectured fussed, nursed petted, often without thanks, scrapes helped of, tips given small store, stitches patient old fingers set you, steps willing old feet taken, gratefully pay dear old ladies little attentions women love receive long live. The bright-eyed girls quick see traits, like better them, death, almost power part mother son, rob yours, sure find tender welcome maternal cherishing Aunt Priscilla, kept warmest corner lonely old heart ‘the best nevvy world’. Jo must fallen asleep (as I dare say reader little homily), suddenly Laurie’s ghost seemed stand her, substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning look used wear felt good deal like show it. But, like Jenny ballad... “She could think he,” lay staring startled silence, till stooped kissed her. Then knew him, flew up, crying joyfully... “Oh Teddy! Oh Teddy!” “Dear Jo, glad see me, then?” “Glad! My blessed boy, words cannot express gladness. Where Amy?” “Your mother got Meg’s. We stopped way, getting wife clutches.” “Your what?” cried Jo, Laurie uttered two words unconscious pride satisfaction betrayed him. “Oh, dickens! Now I done it,” looked guilty Jo like flash. “You gone got married!” “Yes, please, I never again,” went upon knees, penitent clasping hands, face full mischief, mirth, triumph. “Actually married?” “Very much so, thank you.” “Mercy us. What dreadful thing next?” Jo fell seat gasp. “A characteristic, exactly complimentary, congratulation,” returned Laurie, still abject attitude, beaming satisfaction. “What expect, take one’s breath away, creeping like burglar, letting cats bags like that? Get up, ridiculous boy, tell it.” “Not word, unless let come old place, promise barricade.” Jo laughed done many long day, patted sofa invitingly, said cordial tone, “The old pillow garret, need now. So, come ’fess, Teddy.” “How good sounds hear say ‘Teddy’! No one ever calls you,” Laurie sat air great content. “What Amy call you?” “My lord.” “That like her. Well, look it,” Jo’s eye plainly betrayed found boy comelier ever. The pillow gone, barricade, nevertheless, natural one, raised time, absence, change heart. Both felt it, minute looked one another invisible barrier cast little shadow them. It gone directly however, Laurie said, vain attempt dignity... “Do I look like married man head family?” “Not bit, never will. You grown bigger bonnier, scapegrace ever.” “Now really, Jo, ought treat respect,” began Laurie, enjoyed immensely. “How I, mere idea you, married settled, irresistibly funny I cannot keep sober!” answered Jo, smiling face, infectiously another laugh, settled good talk, quite pleasant old fashion. “It use going cold get Amy, coming presently. I could wait. I wanted one tell grand surprise, ‘first skim’ used say squabbled cream.” “Of course did, spoiled story beginning wrong end. Now, start right, tell happened. I pining know.” “Well, I please Amy,” began Laurie, twinkle made Jo exclaim... “Fib number one. Amy please you. Go on, tell truth, can, sir.” “Now beginning marm it. Is jolly hear her?” said Laurie fire, fire glowed sparkled quite agreed. “It same, know, I one. We planned come home Carrols, month ago, suddenly changed minds, decided pass another winter Paris. But Grandpa wanted come home. He went please me, I could let go alone, neither could I leave Amy, Mrs. Carrol got English notions chaperons nonsense, would let Amy come us. So I settled difficulty saying, ‘Let us married, like’.” “Of course did. You always things suit you.” “Not always,” something Laurie’s voice made Jo say hastily... “How ever get Aunt agree?” “It hard work, us, talked over, heaps good reasons side. There time write ask leave, liked it, consented by-and-by, ‘taking time fetlock’, wife says.” “Are proud two words, like say them?” interrupted Jo, addressing fire turn, watching delight happy light seemed kindle eyes tragically gloomy saw last. “A trifle, perhaps, captivating little woman I cannot help proud her. Well, Uncle Aunt play propriety. We absorbed one another mortal use apart, charming arrangement would make everything easy round, it.” “When, where, how?” asked Jo, fever feminine interest curiosity, could realize particle. “Six weeks ago, American consul’s, Paris, quiet wedding course, even happiness forget dear little Beth.” Jo put hand said that, Laurie gently smoothed little red pillow, remembered well. “Why let us know afterward?” asked Jo, quieter tone, sat quite still minute. “We wanted surprise you. We thought coming directly home, first, dear old gentleman, soon married, found could ready month, least, sent us spend honeymoon wherever liked. Amy called Valrosa regular honeymoon home, went there, happy people lives. My faith! Was love among roses!” Laurie seemed forget Jo minute, Jo glad it, fact told things freely naturally assured quite forgiven forgotten. She tried draw away hand, guessed thought prompted half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held fast, said, manly gravity never seen before... “Jo, dear, I want say one thing, put forever. As I told letter I wrote Amy kind me, I never shall stop loving you, love altered, I learned see better is. Amy changed places heart, all. I think meant so, would come naturally, I waited, tried make me, I never could patient, I got heartache. I boy then, headstrong violent, took hard lesson show mistake. For one, Jo, said, I found out, making fool myself. Upon word, I tumbled mind, one time, I know I loved best, Amy, tried love alike. But I could not, I saw Switzerland, everything seemed clear once. You got right places, I felt sure well old love new, I could honestly share heart sister Jo wife Amy, love dearly. Will believe it, go back happy old times first knew one another?” “I believe it, heart, but, Teddy, never boy girl again. The happy old times cannot come back, must expect it. We man woman now, sober work do, playtime over, must give frolicking. I sure feel this. I see change you, find me. I shall miss boy, I shall love man much, admire more, means I hoped would. We cannot little playmates longer, brother sister, love help one another lives, we, Laurie?” He say word, took hand offered him, laid face minute, feeling grave boyish passion, risen beautiful, strong friendship bless both. Presently Jo said cheerfully, want coming home sad one, “I cannot make true children really married going set housekeeping. Why, seems yesterday I buttoning Amy’s pinafore, pulling hair teased. Mercy me, time fly!” “As one children older yourself, need talk like grandma. I flatter I ‘gentleman growed’ Peggotty said David, see Amy, find rather precocious infant,” said Laurie, looking amused maternal air. “You may little older years, I ever much older feeling, Teddy. Women always are, last year hard one I feel forty.” “Poor Jo! We left bear alone, went pleasuring. You older. Here line, another. Unless smile, eyes look sad, I touched cushion, now, I found tear it. You great deal bear, bear alone. What selfish beast I been!” Laurie pulled hair, remorseful look. But Jo turned traitorous pillow, answered, tone tried make cheerful, “No, I Father Mother help me, dear babies comfort me, thought Amy safe happy, make troubles easier bear. I lonely, sometimes, I dare say good me, and...” “You never shall again,” broke Laurie, putting arm her, fence every human ill. “Amy I cannot get without you, must come teach ‘the children’ keep house, go halves everything, used do, let us pet you, blissfully happy friendly together.” “If I way, would pleasant. I begin feel quite young already, somehow troubles seemed fly away came. You always comfort, Teddy,” Jo leaned head shoulder, years ago, Beth lay ill Laurie told hold him. He looked her, wondering remembered time, Jo smiling herself, truth troubles vanished coming. “You Jo still, dropping tears one minute, laughing next. You look little wicked now. What it, Grandma?” “I wondering Amy get together.” “Like angels!” “Yes, course, rules?” “I mind telling now, least I let think so, pleases her, know. By-and-by shall take turns, marriage, say, halves one’s rights doubles one’s duties.” “You go begin, Amy rule days life.” “Well, imperceptibly I think I shall mind much. She sort woman knows rule well. In fact, I rather like it, winds one round finger softly prettily skein silk, makes feel favor while.” “That ever I live see henpecked husband enjoying it!” cried Jo, uplifted hands. It good see Laurie square shoulders, smile masculine scorn insinuation, replied, “high mighty” air, “Amy well-bred that, I sort man submit it. My wife I respect one another much ever tyrannize quarrel.” Jo liked that, thought new dignity becoming, boy seemed changing fast man, regret mingled pleasure. “I sure that. Amy never quarrel used to. She sun I wind, fable, sun managed man best, remember.” “She blow well shine him,” laughed Laurie. “Such lecture I got Nice! I give word deal worse scoldings, regular rouser. I tell sometime, never will, telling despised ashamed me, lost heart despicable party married good-for-nothing.” “What baseness! Well, abuses you, come me, I defend you.” “I look I needed it, I?” said Laurie, getting striking attitude suddenly changed imposing rapturous, Amy’s voice heard calling, “Where she? Where dear old Jo?” In trooped whole family, everyone hugged kissed again, several vain attempts, three wanderers set looked exulted over. Mr. Laurence, hale hearty ever, quite much improved others foreign tour, crustiness seemed nearly gone, old-fashioned courtliness received polish made kindlier ever. It good see beam ‘my children’, called young pair. It better still see Amy pay daughterly duty affection completely old heart, best all, watch Laurie revolve two, never tired enjoying pretty picture made. The minute put eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious dress Parisian air, young Mrs. Moffat would entirely eclipsed young Mrs. Laurence, ‘her ladyship’ altogether elegant graceful woman. Jo thought, watched pair, “How well look together! I right, Laurie found beautiful, accomplished girl become home better clumsy old Jo, pride, torment him.” Mrs. March husband smiled nodded happy faces, saw youngest done well, worldly things, better wealth love, confidence, happiness. For Amy’s face full soft brightness betokens peaceful heart, voice new tenderness it, cool, prim carriage changed gentle dignity, womanly winning. No little affectations marred it, cordial sweetness manner charming new beauty old grace, stamped unmistakable sign true gentlewoman hoped become. “Love done much little girl,” said mother softly. “She good example life, dear,” Mr. March whispered back, loving look worn face gray head beside him. Daisy found impossible keep eyes ‘pitty aunty’, attached like lap dog wonderful chatelaine full delightful charms. Demi paused consider new relationship compromised rash acceptance bribe, took tempting form family wooden bears Berne. A flank movement produced unconditional surrender, however, Laurie knew him. “Young man, I first honor making acquaintance hit face. Now I demand satisfaction gentleman,” tall uncle proceeded toss tousle small nephew way damaged philosophical dignity much delighted boyish soul. “Blest silk head foot; relishin’ sight see settin’ fine fiddle, hear folks calling little Amy ‘Mis. Laurence!’” muttered old Hannah, could resist frequent “peeks” slide set table decidedly promiscuous manner. Mercy us, talk! first one, other, burst together—trying tell history three years half hour. It fortunate tea hand, produce lull provide refreshment—for would hoarse faint gone much longer. Such happy procession filed away little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence. Mrs. March proudly leaned arm ‘my son’. The old gentleman took Jo, whispered, “You must girl now,” glance empty corner fire, made Jo whisper back, “I try fill place, sir.” The twins pranced behind, feeling millennium hand, everyone busy newcomers left revel sweet will, may sure made opportunity. Did steal sips tea, stuff gingerbread ad libitum, get hot biscuit apiece, crowning trespass, whisk captivating little tart tiny pockets, stick crumble treacherously, teaching human nature pastry frail? Burdened guilty consciousness sequestered tarts, fearing Dodo’s sharp eyes would pierce thin disguise cambric merino hid booty, little sinners attached ‘Dranpa’, spectacles on. Amy, handed like refreshments, returned parlor Father Laurence’s arm. The others paired before, arrangement left Jo companionless. She mind minute, lingered answer Hannah’s eager inquiry. “Will Miss Amy ride coop (coupe), use lovely silver dishes stored away yander?” “Should wonder drove six white horses, ate gold plate, wore diamonds point lace every day. Teddy thinks nothing good her,” returned Jo infinite satisfaction. “No is! Will hash fishballs breakfast?” asked Hannah, wisely mingled poetry prose. “I care,” Jo shut door, feeling food uncongenial topic then. She stood minute looking party vanishing above, Demi’s short plaid legs toiled last stair, sudden sense loneliness came strongly looked dim eyes, find something lean upon, even Teddy deserted her. If known birthday gift coming every minute nearer nearer, would said herself, “I weep little weep I go bed. It dismal now.” Then drew hand eyes, one boyish habits never know handkerchief was, managed call smile came knock porch door. She opened hospitable haste, started another ghost come surprise her, stood tall bearded gentleman, beaming darkness like midnight sun. “Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I glad see you!” cried Jo, clutch, feared night would swallow could get in. “And I see Miss Marsch, no, haf party,” Professor paused sound voices tap dancing feet came them. “No, not, family. My sister friends come home, happy. Come in, make one us.” Though social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would gone decorously away, come another day, could he, Jo shut door behind him, bereft hat? Perhaps face something it, forgot hide joy seeing him, showed frankness proved irresistible solitary man, whose welcome far exceeded boldest hopes. “If I shall Monsieur de Trop, I gladly see all. You haf ill, friend?” He put question abruptly, for, Jo hung coat, light fell face, saw change it. “Not ill, tired sorrowful. We trouble since I saw last.” “Ah, yes, I know. My heart sore I heard that,” shook hands again, sympathetic face Jo felt comfort could equal look kind eyes, grasp big, warm hand. “Father, Mother, friend, Professor Bhaer,” said, face tone irrepressible pride pleasure might well blown trumpet opened door flourish. If stranger doubts reception, set rest minute cordial welcome received. Everyone greeted kindly, Jo’s sake first, soon liked own. They could help it, carried talisman opens hearts, simple people warmed once, feeling even friendly poor. For poverty enriches live it, sure passport truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer sat looking air traveler knocks strange door, opens, finds home. The children went like bees honeypot, establishing knee, proceeded captivate rifling pockets, pulling beard, investigating watch, juvenile audacity. The women telegraphed approval one another, Mr. March, feeling got kindred spirit, opened choicest stores guest’s benefit, silent John listened enjoyed talk, said word, Mr. Laurence found impossible go sleep. If Jo otherwise engaged, Laurie’s behavior would amused her, faint twinge, jealousy, something like suspicion, caused gentleman stand aloof first, observe newcomer brotherly circumspection. But last long. He got interested spite himself, knew it, drawn circle. For Mr. Bhaer talked well genial atmosphere, justice. He seldom spoke Laurie, looked often, shadow would pass across face, regretting lost youth, watched young man prime. Then eyes would turn Jo wistfully would surely answered mute inquiry seen it. But Jo eyes take care of, feeling could trusted, prudently kept little sock knitting, like model maiden aunt. A stealthy glance refreshed like sips fresh water dusty walk, sidelong peeps showed several propitious omens. Mr. Bhaer’s face lost absent-minded expression, looked alive interest present moment, actually young handsome, thought, forgetting compare Laurie, usually strange men, great detriment. Then seemed quite inspired, though burial customs ancients, conversation strayed, might considered exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed triumph Teddy got quenched argument, thought herself, watched father’s absorbed face, “How would enjoy man Professor talk every day!” Lastly, Mr. Bhaer dressed new suit black, made look like gentleman ever. His bushy hair cut smoothly brushed, stay order long, exciting moments, rumpled droll way used do, Jo liked rampantly erect better flat, thought gave fine forehead Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, glorify plain man, sat knitting away quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, even fact Mr. Bhaer actually gold sleeve-buttons immaculate wristbands. “Dear old fellow! He could got care would going a-wooing,” said Jo herself, sudden thought born words made blush dreadfully drop ball, go hide face. The maneuver succeed well expected, however, though act setting fire funeral pyre, Professor dropped torch, metaphorically speaking, made dive little blue ball. Of course bumped heads smartly together, saw stars, came flushed laughing, without ball, resume seats, wishing left them. Nobody knew evening went to, Hannah skillfully abstracted babies early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, Mr. Laurence went home rest. The others sat round fire, talking away, utterly regardless lapse time, till Meg, whose maternal mind impressed firm conviction Daisy tumbled bed, Demi set nightgown afire studying structure matches, made move go. “We must sing, good old way, together more,” said Jo, feeling good shout would safe pleasant vent jubilant emotions soul. They there. But one found words thoughtless untrue, Beth still seemed among them, peaceful presence, invisible, dearer ever, since death could break household league love made dissoluble. The little chair stood old place. The tidy basket, bit work left unfinished needle grew ‘so heavy’, still accustomed shelf. The beloved instrument, seldom touched moved, Beth’s face, serene smiling, early days, looked upon them, seeming say, “Be happy. I here.” “Play something, Amy. Let hear much improved,” said Laurie, pardonable pride promising pupil. But Amy whispered, full eyes, twirled faded stool, “Not tonight, dear. I cannot show tonight.” But show something better brilliancy skill, sang Beth’s songs tender music voice best master could taught, touched listener’s hearts sweeter power inspiration could given her. The room still, clear voice failed suddenly last line Beth’s favorite hymn. It hard say... Earth hath sorrow heaven cannot heal; Amy leaned husband, stood behind her, feeling welcome home quite perfect without Beth’s kiss. “Now, must finish Mignon’s song, Mr. Bhaer sings that,” said Jo, pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared throat gratified “Hem!” stepped corner Jo stood, saying... “You sing me? We go excellently well together.” A pleasing fiction, way, Jo idea music grasshopper. But would consented proposed sing whole opera, warbled away, blissfully regardless time tune. It much matter, Mr. Bhaer sang like true German, heartily well, Jo soon subsided subdued hum, might listen mellow voice seemed sing alone. Know’st thou land citron blooms, used Professor’s favorite line, ‘das land’ meant Germany him, seemed dwell, peculiar warmth melody, upon words... There, oh there, might I thee, O, beloved, go one listener thrilled tender invitation longed say know land, would joyfully depart thither whenever liked. The song considered great success, singer retired covered laurels. But minutes afterward, forgot manners entirely, stared Amy putting bonnet, introduced simply ‘my sister’, one called new name since came. He forgot still Laurie said, gracious manner, parting... “My wife I glad meet you, sir. Please remember always welcome waiting way.” Then Professor thanked heartily, looked suddenly illuminated satisfaction, Laurie thought delightfully demonstrative old fellow ever met. “I shall go, I shall gladly come again, gif leave, dear madame, little business city keep days.” He spoke Mrs. March, looked Jo, mother’s voice gave cordial assent daughter’s eyes, Mrs. March blind children’s interest Mrs. Moffat supposed. “I suspect wise man,” remarked Mr. March, placid satisfaction, hearthrug, last guest gone. “I know good one,” added Mrs. March, decided approval, wound clock. “I thought would like him,” Jo said, slipped away bed. She wondered business brought Mr. Bhaer city, finally decided appointed great honor, somewhere, modest mention fact. If seen face when, safe room, looked picture severe rigid young lady, good deal hair, appeared gazing darkly futurity, might thrown light upon subject, especially turned gas, kissed picture dark. CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR MY LORD AND LADY “Please, Madam Mother, could lend wife half hour? The luggage come, I making hay Amy’s Paris finery, trying find things I want,” said Laurie, coming next day find Mrs. Laurence sitting mother’s lap, made ‘the baby’ again. “Certainly. Go, dear, I forgot home this,” Mrs. March pressed white hand wore wedding ring, asking pardon maternal covetousness. “I come I could helped it, I cannot get without little woman a...” “Weathercock without wind,” suggested Jo, paused simile. Jo grown quite saucy self since Teddy came home. “Exactly, Amy keeps pointing due west time, occasional whiffle round south, I easterly spell since I married. Do know anything north, altogether salubrious balmy, hey, lady?” “Lovely weather far. I know long last, I afraid storms, I learning sail ship. Come home, dear, I find bootjack. I suppose rummaging among things. Men helpless, Mother,” said Amy, matronly air, delighted husband. “What going get settled?” asked Jo, buttoning Amy’s cloak used button pinafores. “We plans. We mean say much yet, new brooms, intend idle. I going business devotion shall delight Grandfather, prove I spoiled. I need something sort keep steady. I tired dawdling, mean work like man.” “And Amy, going do?” asked Mrs. March, well pleased Laurie’s decision energy spoke. “After civil round, airing best bonnet, shall astonish elegant hospitalities mansion, brilliant society shall draw us, beneficial influence shall exert world large. That it, it, Madame Recamier?” asked Laurie quizzical look Amy. “Time show. Come away, Impertinence, shock family calling names faces,” answered Amy, resolving home good wife set salon queen society. “How happy children seem together!” observed Mr. March, finding difficult become absorbed Aristotle young couple gone. “Yes, I think last,” added Mrs. March, restful expression pilot brought ship safely port. “I know will. Happy Amy!” Jo sighed, smiled brightly Professor Bhaer opened gate impatient push. Later evening, mind set rest bootjack, Laurie said suddenly wife, “Mrs. Laurence.” “My Lord!” “That man intends marry Jo!” “I hope so, you, dear?” “Well, love, I consider trump, fullest sense expressive word, I wish little younger good deal richer.” “Now, Laurie, fastidious worldly-minded. If love one another matter particle old poor. Women never marry money...” Amy caught short words escaped her, looked husband, replied, malicious gravity... “Certainly not, though hear charming girls say intend sometimes. If memory serves me, thought duty make rich match. That accounts, perhaps, marrying good-for-nothing like me.” “Oh, dearest boy, not, say that! I forgot rich I said ‘Yes’. I would married penny, I sometimes wish poor I might show much I love you.” And Amy, dignified public fond private, gave convincing proofs truth words. “You really think I mercenary creature I tried once, you? It would break heart believe I would gladly pull boat you, even get living rowing lake.” “Am I idiot brute? How could I think so, refused richer man me, let give half I want now, I right? Girls every day, poor things, taught think salvation, better lessons, though I trembled one time, I disappointed, daughter true mother’s teaching. I told Mamma yesterday, looked glad grateful I would given check million, spent charity. You listening moral remarks, Mrs. Laurence,” Laurie paused, Amy’s eyes absent look, though fixed upon face. “Yes, I am, admiring mole chin time. I wish make vain, I must confess I prouder handsome husband money. Do laugh, nose comfort me,” Amy softly caressed well-cut feature artistic satisfaction. Laurie received many compliments life, never one suited better, plainly showed though laugh wife’s peculiar taste, said slowly, “May I ask question, dear?” “Of course, may.” “Shall care Jo marry Mr. Bhaer?” “Oh, trouble it? I thought something dimple quite suit you. Not dog manger, happiest fellow alive, I assure I dance Jo’s wedding heart light heels. Do doubt it, darling?” Amy looked him, satisfied. Her little jealous fear vanished forever, thanked him, face full love confidence. “I wish could something capital old Professor. Could invent rich relation, shall obligingly die Germany, leave tidy little fortune?” said Laurie, began pace long drawing room, arm arm, fond doing, memory chateau garden. “Jo would find us out, spoil all. She proud him, is, said yesterday thought poverty beautiful thing.” “Bless dear heart! She think literary husband, dozen little professors professorins support. We interfere now, watch chance, good turn spite themselves. I owe Jo part education, believes people’s paying honest debts, I get round way.” “How delightful able help others, it? That always one dreams, power giving freely, thanks you, dream come true.” “Ah, quantities good, we? There one sort poverty I particularly like help. Out-and-out beggars get taken care of, poor gentle folks fare badly, ask, people dare offer charity. Yet thousand ways helping them, one knows delicately offend. I must say, I like serve decayed gentleman better blarnerying beggar. I suppose wrong, I do, though harder.” “Because takes gentleman it,” added member domestic admiration society. “Thank you, I afraid I deserve pretty compliment. But I going say I dawdling abroad, I saw good many talented young fellows making sorts sacrifices, enduring real hardships, might realize dreams. Splendid fellows, them, working like heros, poor friendless, full courage, patience, ambition I ashamed myself, longed give right good lift. Those people satisfaction help, got genius, honor allowed serve them, let lost delayed want fuel keep pot boiling. If not, pleasure comfort poor souls, keep despair find out.” “Yes, indeed, another class cannot ask, suffer silence. I know something it, I belonged made princess me, king beggarmaid old story. Ambitious girls hard time, Laurie, often see youth, health, precious opportunities go by, want little help right minute. People kind me, whenever I see girls struggling along, used do, I want put hand help them, I helped.” “And shall, like angel are!” cried Laurie, resolving, glow philanthropic zeal, found endow institution express benefit young women artistic tendencies. “Rich people right sit enjoy themselves, let money accumulate others waste. It half sensible leave legacies one dies use money wisely alive, enjoy making one’s fellow creatures happy it. We good time ourselves, add extra relish pleasure giving people generous taste. Will little Dorcas, going emptying big basket comforts, filling good deeds?” “With heart, brave St. Martin, stopping ride gallantly world share cloak beggar.” “It bargain, shall get best it!” So young pair shook hands upon it, paced happily again, feeling pleasant home homelike hoped brighten homes, believing feet would walk uprightly along flowery path them, smoothed rough ways feet, feeling hearts closely knit together love could tenderly remember less blest they. CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE DAISY AND DEMI I cannot feel I done duty humble historian March family, without devoting least one chapter two precious important members it. Daisy Demi arrived years discretion, fast age babies three four assert rights, get them, too, many elders do. If ever pair twins danger utterly spoiled adoration, prattling Brookes. Of course remarkable children ever born, shown I mention walked eight months, talked fluently twelve months, two years took places table, behaved propriety charmed beholders. At three, Daisy demanded ‘needler’, actually made bag four stitches it. She likewise set housekeeping sideboard, managed microscopic cooking stove skill brought tears pride Hannah’s eyes, Demi learned letters grandfather, invented new mode teaching alphabet forming letters arms legs, thus uniting gymnastics head heels. The boy early developed mechanical genius delighted father distracted mother, tried imitate every machine saw, kept nursery chaotic condition, ‘sewinsheen’, mysterious structure string, chairs, clothespins, spools, wheels go ‘wound wound’. Also basket hung back chair, vainly tried hoist confiding sister, who, feminine devotion, allowed little head bumped till rescued, young inventor indignantly remarked, “Why, Marmar, dat’s lellywaiter, me’s trying pull up.” Though utterly unlike character, twins got remarkably well together, seldom quarreled thrice day. Of course, Demi tyrannized Daisy, gallantly defended every aggressor, Daisy made galley slave herself, adored brother one perfect world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul Daisy, found way everybody’s heart, nestled there. One captivating children, seem made kissed cuddled, adorned adored like little goddesses, produced general approval festive occasions. Her small virtues sweet would quite angelic small naughtinesses kept delightfully human. It fair weather world, every morning scrambled window little nightgown look out, say, matter whether rained shone, “Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!” Everyone friend, offered kisses stranger confidingly inveterate bachelor relented, baby-lovers became faithful worshipers. “Me loves evvybody,” said, opening arms, spoon one hand, mug other, eager embrace nourish whole world. As grew, mother began feel Dovecote would blessed presence inmate serene loving helped make old house home, pray might spared loss like lately taught long entertained angel unawares. Her grandfather often called ‘Beth’, grandmother watched untiring devotion, trying atone past mistake, eye could see. Demi, like true Yankee, inquiring turn, wanting know everything, often getting much disturbed could get satisfactory answers perpetual “What for?” He also possessed philosophic bent, great delight grandfather, used hold Socratic conversations him, precocious pupil occasionally posed teacher, undisguised satisfaction womenfolk. “What makes legs go, Dranpa?” asked young philosopher, surveying active portions frame meditative air, resting go-to-bed frolic one night. “It little mind, Demi,” replied sage, stroking yellow head respectfully. “What little mine?” “It something makes body move, spring made wheels go watch I showed you.” “Open me. I want see go wound.” “I cannot could open watch. God winds up, go till He stops you.” “Does I?” Demi’s brown eyes grew big bright took new thought. “Is I wounded like watch?” “Yes, I cannot show how, done see.” Demi felt back, expecting find like watch, gravely remarked, “I dess Dod I’s asleep.” A careful explanation followed, listened attentively anxious grandmother said, “My dear, think wise talk things baby? He getting great bumps eyes, learning ask unanswerable questions.” “If old enough ask question old enough receive true answers. I putting thoughts head, helping unfold already there. These children wiser are, I doubt boy understands every word I said him. Now, Demi, tell keep mind.” If boy replied like Alcibiades, “By gods, Socrates, I cannot tell,” grandfather would surprised, when, standing moment one leg, like meditative young stork, answered, tone calm conviction, “In little belly,” old gentleman could join Grandma’s laugh, dismiss class metaphysics. There might maternal anxiety, Demi given convincing proofs true boy, well budding philosopher, often, discussion caused Hannah prophesy, ominous nods, “That child long world,” would turn set fears rest pranks dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract delight parent’s souls. Meg made many moral rules, tried keep them, mother ever proof winning wiles, ingenious evasions, tranquil audacity miniature men women early show accomplished Artful Dodgers? “No raisins, Demi. They make sick,” says Mamma young person offers services kitchen unfailing regularity plum-pudding day. “Me likes sick.” “I want you, run away help Daisy make patty cakes.” He reluctantly departs, wrongs weigh upon spirit, by-and-by opportunity comes redress them, outwits Mamma shrewd bargain. “Now good children, I play anything like,” says Meg, leads assistant cooks upstairs, pudding safely bouncing pot. “Truly, Marmar?” asks Demi, brilliant idea well-powdered head. “Yes, truly. Anything say,” replies shortsighted parent, preparing sing, “The Three Little Kittens” half dozen times over, take family “Buy penny bun,” regardless wind limb. But Demi corners cool reply... “Then go eat raisins.” Aunt Dodo chief playmate confidante children, trio turned little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy yet name them, Aunt Beth soon faded pleasantly vague memory, Aunt Dodo living reality, made her, compliment deeply grateful. But Mr. Bhaer came, Jo neglected playfellows, dismay desolation fell upon little souls. Daisy, fond going peddling kisses, lost best customer became bankrupt. Demi, infantile penetration, soon discovered Dodo like play ‘the bear-man’ better him, though hurt, concealed anguish, heart insult rival kept mine chocolate drops waistcoat pocket, watch could taken case freely shaken ardent admirers. Some persons might considered pleasing liberties bribes, Demi see light, continued patronize ‘the bear-man’ pensive affability, Daisy bestowed small affections upon third call, considered shoulder throne, arm refuge, gifts treasures surpassing worth. Gentlemen sometimes seized sudden fits admiration young relatives ladies honor regard, counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, deceive anybody particle. Mr. Bhaer’s devotion sincere, however likewise effective—for honesty best policy love law. He one men home children, looked particularly well little faces made pleasant contrast manly one. His business, whatever was, detained day day, evening seldom failed bring see—well, always asked Mr. March, I suppose attraction. The excellent papa labored delusion was, reveled long discussions kindred spirit, till chance remark observing grandson suddenly enlightened him. Mr. Bhaer came one evening pause threshold study, astonished spectacle met eye. Prone upon floor lay Mr. March, respectable legs air, beside him, likewise prone, Demi, trying imitate attitude short, scarlet-stockinged legs, grovelers seriously absorbed unconscious spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed sonorous laugh, Jo cried out, scandalized face... “Father, Father, Professor!” Down went black legs came gray head, preceptor said, undisturbed dignity, “Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse moment. We finishing lesson. Now, Demi, make letter tell name.” “I knows him!” and, convulsive efforts, red legs took shape pair compasses, intelligent pupil triumphantly shouted, “It We, Dranpa, We!” “He born Weller,” laughed Jo, parent gathered up, nephew tried stand head, mode expressing satisfaction school over. “What today, bubchen?” asked Mr. Bhaer, picking gymnast. “Me went see little Mary.” “And there?” “I kissed her,” began Demi, artless frankness. “Prut! Thou beginnest early. What little Mary say that?” asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing confess young sinner, stood upon knee, exploring waistcoat pocket. “Oh, liked it, kissed me, I liked it. Do little boys like little girls?” asked Demi, mouth full, air bland satisfaction. “You precocious chick! Who put head?” said Jo, enjoying innocent revelation much Professor. “’Tisn’t mine head, mine mouf,” answered literal Demi, putting tongue, chocolate drop it, thinking alluded confectionery, ideas. “Thou shouldst save little friend. Sweets sweet, mannling,” Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, look made wonder chocolate nectar drunk gods. Demi also saw smile, impressed it, artlessy inquired. .. “Do great boys like great girls, to, ’Fessor?” Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer ‘could tell lie’, gave somewhat vague reply believed sometimes, tone made Mr. March put clothesbrush, glance Jo’s retiring face, sink chair, looking ‘precocious chick’ put idea head sweet sour. Why Dodo, caught china closet half hour afterward, nearly squeezed breath little body tender embrace, instead shaking there, followed novel performance unexpected gift big slice bread jelly, remained one problems Demi puzzled small wits, forced leave unsolved forever. CHAPTER FORTY-SIX UNDER THE UMBRELLA While Laurie Amy taking conjugal strolls velvet carpets, set house order, planned blissful future, Mr. Bhaer Jo enjoying promenades different sort, along muddy roads sodden fields. “I always take walk toward evening, I know I give up, I happen meet Professor way out,” said Jo herself, two three encounters, though two paths Meg’s whichever one took sure meet him, either going returning. He always walking rapidly, never seemed see quite close, would look short-sighted eyes failed recognize approaching lady till moment. Then, going Meg’s always something babies. If face turned homeward, merely strolled see river, returning, unless tired frequent calls. Under circumstances, could Jo greet civilly, invite in? If tired visits, concealed weariness perfect skill, took care coffee supper, “as Friedrich—I mean Mr. Bhaer—does like tea.” By second week, everyone knew perfectly well going on, yet everyone tried look stone-blind changes Jo’s face. They never asked sang work, hair three times day, got blooming evening exercise. And one seemed slightest suspicion Professor Bhaer, talking philosophy father, giving daughter lessons love. Jo could even lose heart decorous manner, sternly tried quench feelings, failing so, led somewhat agitated life. She mortally afraid laughed surrendering, many vehement declarations independence. Laurie especial dread, thanks new manager, behaved praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer ‘a capital old fellow’ public, never alluded, remotest manner, Jo’s improved appearance, expressed least surprise seeing Professor’s hat Marches’ table nearly every evening. But exulted private longed time come could give Jo piece plate, bear ragged staff appropriate coat arms. For fortnight, Professor came went lover-like regularity. Then stayed away three whole days, made sign, proceeding caused everybody look sober, Jo become pensive, first, then—alas romance—very cross. “Disgusted, I dare say, gone home suddenly came. It nothing me, course, I think would come bid us goodbye like gentleman,” said herself, despairing look gate, put things customary walk one dull afternoon. “You would better take little umbrella, dear. It looks like rain,” said mother, observing new bonnet, alluding fact. “Yes, Marmee, want anything town? I got run get paper,” returned Jo, pulling bow chin glass excuse looking mother. “Yes, I want twilled silesia, paper number nine needles, two yards narrow lavender ribbon. Have got thick boots on, something warm cloak?” “I believe so,” answered Jo absently. “If happen meet Mr. Bhaer, bring home tea. I quite long see dear man,” added Mrs. March. Jo heard that, made answer, except kiss mother, walk rapidly away, thinking glow gratitude, spite heartache, “How good me! What girls mothers help troubles?” The dry-goods stores among counting-houses, banks, wholesale warerooms, gentlemen congregate, Jo found part city single errand, loitering along waiting someone, examining engineering instruments one window samples wool another, unfeminine interest, tumbling barrels, half-smothered descending bales, hustled unceremoniously busy men looked wondered ‘how deuce got there’. A drop rain cheek recalled thoughts baffled hopes ruined ribbons. For drops continued fall, woman well lover, felt that, though late save heart, might bonnet. Now remembered little umbrella, forgotten take hurry off, regret unavailing, nothing could done borrow one submit drenching. She looked lowering sky, crimson bow already flecked black, forward along muddy street, one long, lingering look behind, certain grimy warehouse, ‘Hoffmann, Swartz, & Co.’ door, said herself, sternly reproachful air... “It serves right! business I put best things come philandering here, hoping see Professor? Jo, I ashamed you! No, shall go borrow umbrella, find is, friends. You shall trudge away, errands rain, catch death ruin bonnet, deserve. Now then!” With rushed across street impetuously narrowly escaped annihilation passing truck, precipitated arms stately old gentleman, said, “I beg pardon, madam,” looked mortally offended. Somewhat daunted, Jo righted herself, spread handkerchief devoted ribbons, putting temptation behind her, hurried on, increasing dampness ankles, much clashing umbrellas overhead. The fact somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary unprotected bonnet attracted attention, looking up, saw Mr. Bhaer looking down. “I feel know strong-minded lady goes bravely many horse noses, fast much mud. What here, friend?” “I shopping.” Mr. Bhaer smiled, glanced pickle factory one side wholesale hide leather concern other, said politely, “You haf umbrella. May I go also, take bundles?” “Yes, thank you.” Jo’s cheeks red ribbon, wondered thought her, care, minute found walking away arm arm Professor, feeling sun suddenly burst uncommon brilliancy, world right again, one thoroughly happy woman paddling wet day. “We thought gone,” said Jo hastily, knew looking her. Her bonnet big enough hide face, feared might think joy betrayed unmaidenly. “Did believe I go farewell haf heavenly kind me?” asked reproachfully felt insulted suggestion, answered heartily... “No, I not. I knew busy affairs, rather missed you, Father Mother especially.” “And you?” “I always glad see you, sir.” In anxiety keep voice quite calm, Jo made rather cool, frosty little monosyllable end seemed chill Professor, smile vanished, said gravely... “I thank you, come one time I go.” “You going, then?” “I haf longer business here, done.” “Successfully, I hope?” said Jo, bitterness disappointment short reply his. “I ought think so, I haf way opened I make bread gif Junglings much help.” “Tell me, please! I like know the—the boys,” said Jo eagerly. “That kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find place college, I teach home, earn enough make way smooth Franz Emil. For I grateful, I not?” “Indeed should. How splendid like, able see often, boys!” cried Jo, clinging lads excuse satisfaction could help betraying. “Ah! But shall meet often, I fear, place West.” “So far away!” Jo left skirts fate, matter became clothes herself. Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, learned read women yet. He flattered knew Jo pretty well, was, therefore, much amazed contradictions voice, face, manner, showed rapid succession day, half dozen different moods course half hour. When met looked surprised, though impossible help suspecting come express purpose. When offered arm, took look filled delight, asked missed him, gave chilly, formal reply despair fell upon him. On learning good fortune almost clapped hands. Was joy boys? Then hearing destination, said, “So far away!” tone despair lifted pinnacle hope, next minute tumbled observing, like one entirely absorbed matter... “Here place errands. Will come in? It take long.” Jo rather prided upon shopping capabilities, particularly wished impress escort neatness dispatch would accomplish business. But owing flutter in, everything went amiss. She upset tray needles, forgot silesia ‘twilled’ till cut off, gave wrong change, covered confusion asking lavender ribbon calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching blush blunder, watched, bewilderment seemed subside, beginning see occasions, women, like dreams, go contraries. When came out, put parcel arm cheerful aspect, splashed puddles rather enjoyed whole. “Should little call shopping babies, haf farewell feast tonight I go last call pleasant home?” asked, stopping window full fruit flowers. “What buy?” asked Jo, ignoring latter part speech, sniffing mingled odors affectation delight went in. “May haf oranges figs?” asked Mr. Bhaer, paternal air. “They eat get them.” “Do care nuts?” “Like squirrel.” “Hamburg grapes. Yes, shall drink Fatherland those?” Jo frowned upon piece extravagance, asked buy frail dates, cask raisins, bag almonds, done it? Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated purse, produced own, finished marketing buying several pounds grapes, pot rosy daisies, pretty jar honey, regarded light demijohn. Then distorting pockets knobby bundles, giving flowers hold, put old umbrella, traveled again. “Miss Marsch, I haf great favor ask you,” began Professor, moist promenade half block. “Yes, sir?” Jo’s heart began beat hard afraid would hear it. “I bold say spite rain, short time remains me.” “Yes, sir,” Jo nearly crushed small flowerpot sudden squeeze gave it. “I wish get little dress Tina, I stupid go alone. Will kindly gif word taste help?” “Yes, sir,” Jo felt calm cool sudden stepped refrigerator. “Perhaps also shawl Tina’s mother, poor sick, husband care. Yes, yes, thick, warm shawl would friendly thing take little mother.” “I pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.” “I going fast, getting dearer every minute,” added Jo herself, mental shake entered business energy pleasant behold. Mr. Bhaer left her, chose pretty gown Tina, ordered shawls. The clerk, married man, condescended take interest couple, appeared shopping family. “Your lady may prefer this. It superior article, desirable color, quite chaste genteel,” said, shaking comfortable gray shawl, throwing Jo’s shoulders. “Does suit you, Mr. Bhaer?” asked, turning back him, feeling deeply grateful chance hiding face. “Excellently well, haf it,” answered Professor, smiling paid it, Jo continued rummage counters like confirmed bargain-hunter. “Now shall go home?” asked, words pleasant him. “Yes, late, I _so_ tired.” Jo’s voice pathetic knew. For sun seemed gone suddenly came out, world grew muddy miserable again, first time discovered feet cold, head ached, heart colder former, fuller pain latter. Mr. Bhaer going away, cared friend, mistake, sooner better. With idea head, hailed approaching omnibus hasty gesture daisies flew pot badly damaged. “This omniboos,” said Professor, waving loaded vehicle away, stopping pick poor little flowers. “I beg pardon. I see name distinctly. Never mind, I walk. I used plodding mud,” returned Jo, winking hard, would died rather openly wipe eyes. Mr. Bhaer saw drops cheeks, though turned head away. The sight seemed touch much, suddenly stooping down, asked tone meant great deal, “Heart’s dearest, cry?” Now, Jo new sort thing would said crying, cold head, told feminine fib proper occasion. Instead which, undignified creature answered, irrepressible sob, “Because going away.” “Ach, mein Gott, good!” cried Mr. Bhaer, managing clasp hands spite umbrella bundles, “Jo, I haf nothing much love gif you. I came see could care it, I waited sure I something friend. Am I? Can make little place heart old Fritz?” added, one breath. “Oh, yes!” said Jo, quite satisfied, folded hands arm, looked expression plainly showed happy would walk life beside him, even though better shelter old umbrella, carried it. It certainly proposing difficulties, even desired so, Mr. Bhaer could go upon knees, account mud. Neither could offer Jo hand, except figuratively, full. Much less could indulge tender remonstrations open street, though near it. So way could express rapture look her, expression glorified face degree actually seemed little rainbows drops sparkled beard. If loved Jo much, I think could done then, looked far lovely, skirts deplorable state, rubber boots splashed ankle, bonnet ruin. Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered beautiful woman living, found “Jove-like” ever, though hatbrim quite limp little rills trickling thence upon shoulders (for held umbrella Jo), every finger gloves needed mending. Passers-by probably thought pair harmless lunatics, entirely forgot hail bus, strolled leisurely along, oblivious deepening dusk fog. Little cared anybody thought, enjoying happy hour seldom comes life, magical moment bestows youth old, beauty plain, wealth poor, gives human hearts foretaste heaven. The Professor looked conquered kingdom, world nothing offer way bliss. While Jo trudged beside him, feeling place always there, wondering ever could chosen lot. Of course, first speak—intelligibly, I mean, emotional remarks followed impetuous “Oh, yes!” coherent reportable character. “Friedrich, you...” “Ah, heaven, gifs name one speaks since Minna died!” cried Professor, pausing puddle regard grateful delight. “I always call myself—I forgot, I unless like it.” “Like it? It sweet I tell. Say ‘thou’, also, I shall say language almost beautiful mine.” “Is ‘thou’ little sentimental?” asked Jo, privately thinking lovely monosyllable. “Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, Germans believe sentiment, keep young mit it. Your English ‘you’ cold, say ‘thou’, heart’s dearest, means much me,” pleaded Mr. Bhaer, like romantic student grave professor. “Well, then, thou tell sooner?” asked Jo bashfully. “Now I shall haf show thee heart, I gladly will, thou must take care hereafter. See, then, Jo—ah, dear, funny little name—I wish tell something day I said goodbye New York, I thought handsome friend betrothed thee, I spoke not. Wouldst thou said ‘Yes’, then, I spoken?” “I know. I afraid not, I heart then.” “Prut! That I believe. It asleep till fairy prince came wood, waked up. Ah, well, ‘Die erste Liebe ist die beste’, I expect.” “Yes, first love best, contented, I never another. Teddy boy, soon got little fancy,” said Jo, anxious correct Professor’s mistake. “Good! Then I shall rest happy, sure thou givest all. I haf waited long, I grown selfish, thou wilt find, Professorin.” “I like that,” cried Jo, delighted new name. “Now tell brought you, last, I wanted you?” “This,” Mr. Bhaer took little worn paper waistcoat pocket. Jo unfolded it, looked much abashed, one contributions paper paid poetry, accounted sending occasional attempt. “How could bring you?” asked, wondering meant. “I found chance. I knew names initials, one little verse seemed call me. Read find him. I see go wet.” IN THE GARRET Four little chests row, Dim dust, worn time, All fashioned filled, long ago, By children prime. Four little keys hung side side, With faded ribbons, brave gay When fastened there, childish pride, Long ago, rainy day. Four little names, one lid, Carved boyish hand, And underneath lieth hid Histories happy band Once playing here, pausing oft To hear sweet refrain, That came went roof aloft, In falling summer rain. “Meg” first lid, smooth fair. I look loving eyes, For folded here, well-known care, A goodly gathering lies, The record peaceful life— Gifts gentle child girl, A bridal gown, lines wife, A tiny shoe, baby curl. No toys first chest remain, For carried away, In old age, join In another small Meg’s play. Ah, happy mother! Well I know You hear, like sweet refrain, Lullabies ever soft low In falling summer rain. “Jo” next lid, scratched worn, And within motley store Of headless dolls, schoolbooks torn, Birds beasts speak more, Spoils brought home fairy ground Only trod youthful feet, Dreams future never found, Memories past still sweet, Half-writ poems, stories wild, April letters, warm cold, Diaries wilful child, Hints woman early old, A woman lonely home, Hearing, like sad refrain— “Be worthy, love, love come,” In falling summer rain. My Beth! dust always swept From lid bears name, As loving eyes wept, By careful hands often came. Death canonized us one saint, Ever less human divine, And still lay, tender plaint, Relics household shrine— The silver bell, seldom rung, The little cap last wore, The fair, dead Catherine hung By angels borne door. The songs sang, without lament, In prison-house pain, Forever sweetly blent With falling summer rain. Upon last lid’s polished field— Legend fair true A gallant knight bears shield, “Amy” letters gold blue. Within lie snoods bound hair, Slippers danced last, Faded flowers laid care, Fans whose airy toils past, Gay valentines, ardent flames, Trifles borne part In girlish hopes fears shames, The record maiden heart Now learning fairer, truer spells, Hearing, like blithe refrain, The silver sound bridal bells In falling summer rain. Four little chests row, Dim dust, worn time, Four women, taught weal woe To love labor prime. Four sisters, parted hour, None lost, one gone before, Made love’s immortal power, Nearest dearest evermore. Oh, hidden stores Lie open Father’s sight, May rich golden hours, Deeds show fairer light, Lives whose brave music long shall ring, Like spirit-stirring strain, Souls shall gladly soar sing In long sunshine rain. “It bad poetry, I felt I wrote it, one day I lonely, good cry rag bag. I never thought would go could tell tales,” said Jo, tearing verses Professor treasured long. “Let go, done duty, I haf fresh one I read brown book keeps little secrets,” said Mr. Bhaer smile watched fragments fly away wind. “Yes,” added earnestly, “I read that, I think myself, She sorrow, lonely, would find comfort true love. I haf heart full, full her. Shall I go say, ‘If poor thing gif I shall hope receive, take Gott’s name?’” “And came find poor, one precious thing I needed,” whispered Jo. “I courage think first, heavenly kind welcome me. But soon I began hope, I said, ‘I haf I die it,’ I will!” cried Mr. Bhaer, defiant nod, walls mist closing round barriers surmount valiantly knock down. Jo thought splendid, resolved worthy knight, though come prancing charger gorgeous array. “What made stay away long?” asked presently, finding pleasant ask confidential questions get delightful answers could keep silent. “It easy, I could find heart take happy home I could haf prospect one gif you, much time, perhaps, hard work. How could I ask gif much poor old fellow, fortune little learning?” “I glad poor. I could bear rich husband,” said Jo decidedly, adding softer tone, “Do fear poverty. I known long enough lose dread happy working I love, call old—forty prime life. I could help loving seventy!” The Professor found touching would glad handkerchief, could got it. As could not, Jo wiped eyes him, said, laughing, took away bundle two... “I may strong-minded, one say I sphere now, woman’s special mission supposed drying tears bearing burdens. I carry share, Friedrich, help earn home. Make mind that, I never go,” added resolutely, tried reclaim load. “We shall see. Haf patience wait long time, Jo? I must go away work alone. I must help boys first, because, even you, I may break word Minna. Can forgif that, happy hope wait?” “Yes, I know I can, love one another, makes rest easy bear. I duty, also, work. I could enjoy I neglected even you, need hurry impatience. You part West, I mine here, happy hoping best, leaving future God wills.” “Ah! Thou gifest hope courage, I haf nothing gif back full heart empty hands,” cried Professor, quite overcome. Jo never, never would learn proper, said stood upon steps, put hands his, whispering tenderly, “Not empty now,” stooping down, kissed Friedrich umbrella. It dreadful, would done flock draggle-tailed sparrows hedge human beings, far gone indeed, quite regardless everything happiness. Though came simple guise, crowning moment lives, when, turning night storm loneliness household light warmth peace waiting receive them, glad “Welcome home!” Jo led lover in, shut door. CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN HARVEST TIME For year Jo Professor worked waited, hoped loved, met occasionally, wrote voluminous letters rise price paper accounted for, Laurie said. The second year began rather soberly, prospects brighten, Aunt March died suddenly. But first sorrow over—for loved old lady spite sharp tongue—they found rejoicing, left Plumfield Jo, made sorts joyful things possible. “It fine old place, bring handsome sum, course intend sell it,” said Laurie, talking matter weeks later. “No, I not,” Jo’s decided answer, petted fat poodle, adopted, respect former mistress. “You mean live there?” “Yes, I do.” “But, dear girl, immense house, take power money keep order. The garden orchard alone need two three men, farming Bhaer’s line, I take it.” “He try hand there, I propose it.” “And expect live produce place? Well, sounds paradisiacal, find desperate hard work.” “The crop going raise profitable one,” Jo laughed. “Of fine crop consist, madam?” “Boys. I want open school little lads—a good, happy, homelike school, take care Fritz teach them.” “That truly Joian plan you! Is like her?” cried Laurie, appealing family, looked much surprised he. “I like it,” said Mrs. March decidedly. “So I,” added husband, welcomed thought chance trying Socratic method education modern youth. “It immense care Jo,” said Meg, stroking head one all-absorbing son. “Jo it, happy it. It splendid idea. Tell us it,” cried Mr. Laurence, longing lend lovers hand, knew would refuse help. “I knew would stand me, sir. Amy too—I see eyes, though prudently waits turn mind speaks. Now, dear people,” continued Jo earnestly, “just understand new idea mine, long cherished plan. Before Fritz came, I used think how, I would made fortune, one needed home, I would hire big house, pick poor, forlorn little lads mothers, take care them, make life jolly late. I see many going ruin want help right minute, I love anything them, I seem feel wants, sympathize troubles, oh, I like mother them!” Mrs. March held hand Jo, took it, smiling, tears eyes, went old enthusiastic way, seen long while. “I told plan Fritz once, said would like, agreed try got rich. Bless dear heart, life—helping poor boys, I mean, getting rich, never be. Money stay pocket long enough lay any. But now, thanks good old aunt, loved better I ever deserved, I rich, least I feel so, live Plumfield perfectly well, flourishing school. It place boys, house big, furniture strong plain. There plenty room dozens inside, splendid grounds outside. They could help garden orchard. Such work healthy, it, sir? Then Fritz could train teach way, Father help him. I feed nurse pet scold them, Mother stand-by. I always longed lots boys, never enough, I fill house full revel little dears heart’s content. Think luxury— Plumfield own, wilderness boys enjoy me.” As Jo waved hands gave sigh rapture, family went gale merriment, Mr. Laurence laughed till thought would apoplectic fit. “I see anything funny,” said gravely, could heard. “Nothing could natural proper Professor open school, prefer reside estate.” “She putting airs already,” said Laurie, regarded idea light capital joke. “But may I inquire intend support establishment? If pupils little ragamuffins, I afraid crop profitable worldly sense, Mrs. Bhaer.” “Now wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall rich pupils, also—perhaps begin altogether. Then, I got start, I take ragamuffin two, relish. Rich people’s children often need care comfort, well poor. I seen unfortunate little creatures left servants, backward ones pushed forward, real cruelty. Some naughty mismanagment neglect, lose mothers. Besides, best get hobbledehoy age, time need patience kindness. People laugh them, hustle about, try keep sight, expect turn pretty children fine young men. They complain much—plucky little souls—but feel it. I something it, I know it. I special interest young bears, like show I see warm, honest, well-meaning boys’ hearts, spite clumsy arms legs topsy-turvy heads. I experience, too, I brought one boy pride honor family?” “I testify tried it,” said Laurie grateful look. “And I succeeded beyond hopes, are, steady, sensible businessman, heaps good money, laying blessings poor, instead dollars. But merely businessman, love good beautiful things, enjoy yourself, let others go halves, always old times. I proud you, Teddy, get better every year, everyone feels it, though let say so. Yes, I flock, I point you, say ‘There model, lads’.” Poor Laurie know look, for, man though was, something old bashfulness came burst praise made faces turn approvingly upon him. “I say, Jo, rather much,” began, old boyish way. “You done I ever thank for, except best disappoint you. You rather cast lately, Jo, I best help, nevertheless. So, I got all, may thank two it,” laid one hand gently grandfather’s head, Amy’s golden one, three never far apart. “I think families beautiful things world!” burst Jo, unusually up-lifted frame mind then. “When I one own, I hope happy three I know love best. If John Fritz here, would quite little heaven earth,” added quietly. And night went room blissful evening family counsels, hopes, plans, heart full happiness could calm kneeling beside empty bed always near own, thinking tender thoughts Beth. It astonishing year altogether, things seemed happen unusually rapid delightful manner. Almost knew was, Jo found married settled Plumfield. Then family six seven boys sprung like mushrooms, flourished surprisingly, poor boys well rich, Mr. Laurence continually finding touching case destitution, begging Bhaers take pity child, would gladly pay trifle support. In way, sly old gentleman got round proud Jo, furnished style boy delighted. Of course uphill work first, Jo made queer mistakes, wise Professor steered safely calmer waters, rampant ragamuffin conquered end. How Jo enjoy ‘wilderness boys’, poor, dear Aunt March would lamented see sacred precincts prim, well-ordered Plumfield overrun Toms, Dicks, Harrys! There sort poetic justice it, all, old lady terror boys miles around, exiles feasted freely forbidden plums, kicked gravel profane boots unreproved, played cricket big field irritable ‘cow crumpled horn’ used invite rash youths come tossed. It became sort boys’ paradise, Laurie suggested called ‘Bhaer-garten’, compliment master appropriate inhabitants. It never fashionable school, Professor lay fortune, Jo intended be—‘a happy, homelike place boys, needed teaching, care, kindness’. Every room big house soon full. Every little plot garden soon owner. A regular menagerie appeared barn would, pet animals allowed. And three times day, Jo smiled Fritz head long table lined either side rows happy young faces, turned affectionate eyes, confiding words, grateful hearts, full love ‘Mother Bhaer’. She boys enough now, tire them, though angels, means, caused Professor Professorin much trouble anxiety. But faith good spot exists heart naughtiest, sauciest, tantalizing little ragamuffin gave patience, skill, time success, mortal boy could hold long Father Bhaer shining benevolently sun, Mother Bhaer forgiving seventy times seven. Very precious Jo friendship lads, penitent sniffs whispers wrongdoing, droll touching little confidences, pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, plans, even misfortunes, endeared more. There slow boys bashful boys, feeble boys riotous boys, boys lisped boys stuttered, one two lame ones, merry little quadroon, could taken elsewhere, welcome ‘Bhaer-garten’, though people predicted admission would ruin school. Yes, Jo happy woman there, spite hard work, much anxiety, perpetual racket. She enjoyed heartily found applause boys satisfying praise world, told stories except flock enthusiastic believers admirers. As years went on, two little lads came increase happiness—Rob, named Grandpa, Teddy, happy-go-lucky baby, seemed inherited papa’s sunshiny temper well mother’s lively spirit. How ever grew alive whirlpool boys mystery grandma aunts, flourished like dandelions spring, rough nurses loved served well. There great many holidays Plumfield, one delightful yearly apple-picking. For Marches, Laurences, Brookes Bhaers turned full force made day it. Five years Jo’s wedding, one fruitful festivals occurred, mellow October day, air full exhilarating freshness made spirits rise blood dance healthily veins. The old orchard wore holiday attire. Goldenrod asters fringed mossy walls. Grasshoppers skipped briskly sere grass, crickets chirped like fairy pipers feast. Squirrels busy small harvesting. Birds twittered adieux alders lane, every tree stood ready send shower red yellow apples first shake. Everybody there. Everybody laughed sang, climbed tumbled down. Everybody declared never perfect day jolly set enjoy it, everyone gave simple pleasures hour freely things care sorrow world. Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, Columella Mr. Laurence, enjoying... The gentle apple’s winey juice. The Professor charged green aisles like stout Teutonic knight, pole lance, leading boys, made hook ladder company themselves, performed wonders way ground lofty tumbling. Laurie devoted little ones, rode small daughter bushel-basket, took Daisy among bird’s nests, kept adventurous Rob breaking neck. Mrs. March Meg sat among apple piles like pair Pomonas, sorting contributions kept pouring in, Amy beautiful motherly expression face sketched various groups, watched one pale lad, sat adoring little crutch beside him. Jo element day, rushed about, gown pinned up, hat anywhere head, baby tucked arm, ready lively adventure might turn up. Little Teddy bore charmed life, nothing ever happened him, Jo never felt anxiety whisked tree one lad, galloped back another, supplied sour russets indulgent papa, labored Germanic delusion babies could digest anything, pickled cabbage buttons, nails, small shoes. She knew little Ted would turn time, safe rosy, dirty serene, always received back hearty welcome, Jo loved babies tenderly. At four clock lull took place, baskets remained empty, apple pickers rested compared rents bruises. Then Jo Meg, detachment bigger boys, set forth supper grass, out-of-door tea always crowning joy day. The land literally flowed milk honey occasions, lads required sit table, allowed partake refreshment liked—freedom sauce best beloved boyish soul. They availed rare privilege fullest extent, tried pleasing experiment drinking milk standing heads, others lent charm leapfrog eating pie pauses game, cookies sown broadcast field, apple turnovers roosted trees like new style bird. The little girls private tea party, Ted roved among edibles sweet will. When one could eat more, Professor proposed first regular toast, always drunk times—“Aunt March, God bless her!” A toast heartily given good man, never forgot much owed her, quietly drunk boys, taught keep memory green. “Now, Grandma’s sixtieth birthday! Long life her, three times three!” That given will, may well believe, cheering begun, hard stop it. Everybody’s health proposed, Mr. Laurence, considered special patron, astonished guinea pig, strayed proper sphere search young master. Demi, oldest grandchild, presented queen day various gifts, numerous transported festive scene wheelbarrow. Funny presents, them, would defects eyes ornaments Grandma’s—for children’s gifts own. Every stitch Daisy’s patient little fingers put handkerchiefs hemmed better embroidery Mrs. March. Demi’s miracle mechanical skill, though cover would shut, Rob’s footstool wiggle uneven legs declared soothing, page costly book Amy’s child gave fair appeared tipsy capitals, words—“To dear Grandma, little Beth.” During ceremony boys mysteriously disappeared, Mrs. March tried thank children, broken down, Teddy wiped eyes pinafore, Professor suddenly began sing. Then, him, voice voice took words, tree tree echoed music unseen choir, boys sang hearts little song Jo written, Laurie set music, Professor trained lads give best effect. This something altogether new, proved grand success, Mrs. March could get surprise, insisted shaking hands every one featherless birds, tall Franz Emil little quadroon, sweetest voice all. After this, boys dispersed final lark, leaving Mrs. March daughters festival tree. “I think I ever ought call ‘unlucky Jo’ again, greatest wish beautifully gratified,” said Mrs. Bhaer, taking Teddy’s little fist milk pitcher, rapturously churning. “And yet life different one pictured long ago. Do remember castles air?” asked Amy, smiling watched Laurie John playing cricket boys. “Dear fellows! It heart good see forget business frolic day,” answered Jo, spoke maternal way mankind. “Yes, I remember, life I wanted seems selfish, lonely, cold now. I given hope I may write good book yet, I wait, I sure better experiences illustrations these,” Jo pointed lively lads distance father, leaning Professor’s arm, walked fro sunshine, deep one conversations enjoyed much, mother, sitting enthroned among daughters, children lap feet, found help happiness face never could grow old them. “My castle nearly realized all. I asked splendid things, sure, heart I knew I satisfied, I little home, John, dear children like these. I got all, thank God, happiest woman world,” Meg laid hand tall boy’s head, face full tender devout content. “My castle different I planned, I would alter it, though, like Jo, I relinquish artistic hopes, confine helping others fulfill dreams beauty. I begun model figure baby, Laurie says best thing I ever done. I think so, myself, mean marble, that, whatever happens, I may least keep image little angel.” As Amy spoke, great tear dropped golden hair sleeping child arms, one well-beloved daughter frail little creature dread losing shadow Amy’s sunshine. This cross much father mother, one love sorrow bound closely together. Amy’s nature growing sweeter, deeper, tender. Laurie growing serious, strong, firm, learning beauty, youth, good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care pain, loss sorrow, blessed ... Into life rain must fall, Some days must dark sad dreary. “She growing better, I sure it, dear. Do despond, hope keep happy,” said Mrs. March, tenderhearted Daisy stooped knee lay rosy cheek little cousin’s pale one. “I never ought to, I cheer up, Marmee, Laurie take half every burden,” replied Amy warmly. “He never let us see anxiety, sweet patient me, devoted Beth, stay comfort always I cannot love enough. So, spite one cross, I say Meg, ‘Thank God, I happy woman.’” “There need say it, everyone see I far happier I deserve,” added Jo, glancing good husband chubby children, tumbling grass beside her. “Fritz getting gray stout. I growing thin shadow, thirty. We never shall rich, Plumfield may burn night, incorrigible Tommy Bangs smoke sweet-fern cigars bed-clothes, though set afire three times already. But spite unromantic facts, I nothing complain of, never jolly life. Excuse remark, living among boys, I cannot help using expressions then.” “Yes, Jo, I think harvest good one,” began Mrs. March, frightening away big black cricket staring Teddy countenance. “Not half good yours, Mother. Here is, never thank enough patient sowing reaping done,” cried Jo, loving impetuosity never would outgrow. “I hope wheat fewer tares every year,” said Amy softly. “A large sheaf, I know room heart it, Marmee dear,” added Meg’s tender voice. Touched heart, Mrs. March could stretch arms, gather children grandchildren herself, say, face voice full motherly love, gratitude, humility... “Oh, girls, however long may live, I never wish greater happiness this!”
