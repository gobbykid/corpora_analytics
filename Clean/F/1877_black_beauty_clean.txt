 BLACK BEAUTY Part I 01 My Early Home The first place I well remember large pleasant meadow pond clear water it. Some shady trees leaned it, rushes water-lilies grew deep end. Over hedge one side looked plowed field, looked gate master's house, stood roadside; top meadow grove fir trees, bottom running brook overhung steep bank. While I young I lived upon mother's milk, I could eat grass. In daytime I ran side, night I lay close her. When hot used stand pond shade trees, cold nice warm would near grove. As soon I old enough eat grass mother used go work daytime, come back evening. There six young colts meadow besides me; older I was; nearly large grown-up horses. I used run them, great fun; used gallop together round round field hard could go. Sometimes rather rough play, would frequently bite kick well gallop. One day, good deal kicking, mother whinnied come her, said: “I wish pay attention I going say you. The colts live good colts, cart-horse colts, course learned manners. You well-bred well-born; father great name parts, grandfather cup two years Newmarket races; grandmother sweetest temper horse I ever knew, I think never seen kick bite. I hope grow gentle good, never learn bad ways; work good will, lift feet well trot, never bite kick even play.” I never forgotten mother's advice; I knew wise old horse, master thought great deal her. Her name Duchess, often called Pet. Our master good, kind man. He gave us good food, good lodging, kind words; spoke kindly us little children. We fond him, mother loved much. When saw gate would neigh joy, trot him. He would pat stroke say, “Well, old Pet, little Darkie?” I dull black, called Darkie; would give piece bread, good, sometimes brought carrot mother. All horses would come him, I think favorites. My mother always took town market day light gig. There plowboy, Dick, sometimes came field pluck blackberries hedge. When eaten wanted would called fun colts, throwing stones sticks make gallop. We much mind him, could gallop off; sometimes stone would hit hurt us. One day game, know master next field; there, watching going on; hedge jumped snap, catching Dick arm, gave box ear made roar pain surprise. As soon saw master trotted nearer see went on. “Bad boy!” said, “bad boy! chase colts. This first time, second, shall last. There--take money go home; I shall want farm again.” So never saw Dick more. Old Daniel, man looked horses, gentle master, well off. 02 The Hunt Before I two years old circumstance happened I never forgotten. It early spring; little frost night, light mist still hung woods meadows. I colts feeding lower part field heard, quite distance, sounded like cry dogs. The oldest colts raised head, pricked ears, said, “There hounds!” immediately cantered off, followed rest us upper part field, could look hedge see several fields beyond. My mother old riding horse master's also standing near, seemed know it. “They found hare,” said mother, “and come way shall see hunt.” And soon dogs tearing field young wheat next ours. I never heard noise made. They bark, howl, whine, kept “yo! yo, o, o! yo! yo, o, o!” top voices. After came number men horseback, green coats, galloping fast could. The old horse snorted looked eagerly them, young colts wanted galloping them, soon away fields lower down; seemed come stand; dogs left barking, ran every way noses ground. “They lost scent,” said old horse; “perhaps hare get off.” “What hare?” I said. “Oh! I know hare; likely enough may one hares woods; hare find dogs men run after;” long dogs began “yo! yo, o, o!” again, back came altogether full speed, making straight meadow part high bank hedge overhang brook. “Now shall see hare,” said mother; hare wild fright rushed made woods. On came dogs; burst bank, leaped stream, came dashing across field followed huntsmen. Six eight men leaped horses clean over, close upon dogs. The hare tried get fence; thick, turned sharp round make road, late; dogs upon wild cries; heard one shriek, end her. One huntsmen rode whipped dogs, would soon torn pieces. He held leg torn bleeding, gentlemen seemed well pleased. As me, I astonished I first see going brook; I look sad sight; two fine horses down, one struggling stream, groaning grass. One riders getting water covered mud, lay quite still. “His neck broke,” said mother. “And serve right, too,” said one colts. I thought same, mother join us. “Well, no,” said, “you must say that; though I old horse, seen heard great deal, I never yet could make men fond sport; often hurt themselves, often spoil good horses, tear fields, hare fox, stag, could get easily way; horses, know.” While mother saying stood looked on. Many riders gone young man; master, watching going on, first raise him. His head fell back arms hung down, every one looked serious. There noise now; even dogs quiet, seemed know something wrong. They carried master's house. I heard afterward young George Gordon, squire's son, fine, tall young man, pride family. There riding directions doctor's, farrier's, doubt Squire Gordon's, let know son. When Mr. Bond, farrier, came look black horse lay groaning grass, felt over, shook head; one legs broken. Then one ran master's house came back gun; presently loud bang dreadful shriek, still; black horse moved more. My mother seemed much troubled; said known horse years, name “Rob Roy”; good horse, vice him. She never would go part field afterward. Not many days heard church-bell tolling long time, looking gate saw long, strange black coach covered black cloth drawn black horses; came another another another, black, bell kept tolling, tolling. They carrying young Gordon churchyard bury him. He would never ride again. What Rob Roy I never knew; one little hare. 03 My Breaking In I beginning grow handsome; coat grown fine soft, bright black. I one white foot pretty white star forehead. I thought handsome; master would sell till I four years old; said lads ought work like men, colts ought work like horses till quite grown up. When I four years old Squire Gordon came look me. He examined eyes, mouth, legs; felt down; I walk trot gallop him. He seemed like me, said, “When well broken well.” My master said would break himself, like frightened hurt, lost time it, next day began. Every one may know breaking is, therefore I describe it. It means teach horse wear saddle bridle, carry back man, woman child; go way wish, go quietly. Besides learn wear collar, crupper, breeching, stand still put on; cart chaise fixed behind, cannot walk trot without dragging him; must go fast slow, driver wishes. He must never start sees, speak horses, bite, kick, own; always master's will, even though may tired hungry; worst is, harness on, may neither jump joy lie weariness. So see breaking great thing. I course long used halter headstall, led fields lanes quietly, I bit bridle; master gave oats usual, good deal coaxing got bit mouth, bridle fixed, nasty thing! Those never bit mouths cannot think bad feels; great piece cold hard steel thick man's finger pushed one's mouth, one's teeth, one's tongue, ends coming corner mouth, held fast straps head, throat, round nose, chin; way world get rid nasty hard thing; bad! yes, bad! least I thought so; I knew mother always wore one went out, horses grown up; so, nice oats, master's pats, kind words, gentle ways, I got wear bit bridle. Next came saddle, half bad; master put back gently, old Daniel held head; made girths fast body, patting talking time; I oats, little leading about; every day till I began look oats saddle. At length, one morning, master got back rode round meadow soft grass. It certainly feel queer; I must say I felt rather proud carry master, continued ride little every day I soon became accustomed it. The next unpleasant business putting iron shoes; hard first. My master went smith's forge, see I hurt got fright. The blacksmith took feet hand, one other, cut away hoof. It pain me, I stood still three legs till done all. Then took piece iron shape foot, clapped on, drove nails shoe quite hoof, shoe firmly on. My feet felt stiff heavy, time I got used it. And got far, master went break harness; new things wear. First, stiff heavy collar neck, bridle great side-pieces eyes called blinkers, blinkers indeed were, I could see either side, straight front me; next, small saddle nasty stiff strap went right tail; crupper. I hated crupper; long tail doubled poked strap almost bad bit. I never felt like kicking, course I could kick good master, time I got used everything, could work well mother. I must forget mention one part training, I always considered great advantage. My master sent fortnight neighboring farmer's, meadow skirted one side railway. Here sheep cows, I turned among them. I shall never forget first train ran by. I feeding quietly near pales separated meadow railway, I heard strange sound distance, I knew whence came--with rush clatter, puffing smoke--a long black train something flew by, gone almost I could draw breath. I turned galloped side meadow fast I could go, I stood snorting astonishment fear. In course day many trains went by, slowly; drew station close by, sometimes made awful shriek groan stopped. I thought dreadful, cows went eating quietly, hardly raised heads black frightful thing came puffing grinding past. For first days I could feed peace; I found terrible creature never came field, harm, I began disregard it, soon I cared little passing train cows sheep did. Since I seen many horses much alarmed restive sight sound steam engine; thanks good master's care, I fearless railway stations stable. Now one wants break young horse well, way. My master often drove double harness mother, steady could teach go better strange horse. She told better I behaved better I treated, wisest always best please master; “but,” said she, “there great many kinds men; good thoughtful men like master, horse may proud serve; bad, cruel men, never ought horse dog call own. Besides, great many foolish men, vain, ignorant, careless, never trouble think; spoil horses all, want sense; mean it, that. I hope fall good hands; horse never knows may buy him, may drive him; chance us; still I say, best wherever is, keep good name.” 04 Birtwick Park At time I used stand stable coat brushed every day till shone like rook's wing. It early May, came man Squire Gordon's, took away hall. My master said, “Good-by, Darkie; good horse, always best.” I could say “good-by”, I put nose hand; patted kindly, I left first home. As I lived years Squire Gordon, I may well tell something place. Squire Gordon's park skirted village Birtwick. It entered large iron gate, stood first lodge, trotted along smooth road clumps large old trees; another lodge another gate, brought house gardens. Beyond lay home paddock, old orchard, stables. There accommodation many horses carriages; I need describe stable I taken; roomy, four good stalls; large swinging window opened yard, made pleasant airy. The first stall large square one, shut behind wooden gate; others common stalls, good stalls, nearly large; low rack hay low manger corn; called loose box, horse put tied up, left loose, liked. It great thing loose box. Into fine box groom put me; clean, sweet, airy. I never better box that, sides high I could see went iron rails top. He gave nice oats, patted me, spoke kindly, went away. When I eaten corn I looked round. In stall next mine stood little fat gray pony, thick mane tail, pretty head, pert little nose. I put head iron rails top box, said, “How do? What name?” He turned round far halter would allow, held head, said, “My name Merrylegs. I handsome; I carry young ladies back, sometimes I take mistress low chair. They think great deal me, James. Are going live next door box?” I said, “Yes.” “Well, then,” said, “I hope good-tempered; I like one next door bites.” Just horse's head looked stall beyond; ears laid back, eye looked rather ill-tempered. This tall chestnut mare, long handsome neck. She looked across said: “So turned box; strange thing colt like come turn lady home.” “I beg pardon,” I said, “I turned one out; man brought put here, I nothing it; colt, I turned four years old grown-up horse. I never words yet horse mare, wish live peace.” “Well,” said, “we shall see. Of course, I want words young thing like you.” I said more. In afternoon, went out, Merrylegs told it. “The thing this,” said Merrylegs. “Ginger bad habit biting snapping; call Ginger, loose box used snap much. One day bit James arm made bleed, Miss Flora Miss Jessie, fond me, afraid come stable. They used bring nice things eat, apple carrot, piece bread, Ginger stood box dared come, I missed much. I hope come again, bite snap.” I told I never bit anything grass, hay, corn, could think pleasure Ginger found it. “Well, I think find pleasure,” says Merrylegs; “it bad habit; says one ever kind her, bite? Of course, bad habit; I sure, says true, must ill-used came here. John please her, James can, master never uses whip horse acts right; I think might good-tempered here. You see,” said, wise look, “I twelve years old; I know great deal, I tell better place horse round country this. John best groom ever was; fourteen years; never saw kind boy James is; Ginger's fault stay box.” 05 A Fair Start The name coachman John Manly; wife one little child, lived coachman's cottage, near stables. The next morning took yard gave good grooming, I going box, coat soft bright, squire came look me, seemed pleased. “John,” said, “I meant tried new horse morning, I business. You may well take around breakfast; go common Highwood, back watermill river; show paces.” “I will, sir,” said John. After breakfast came fitted bridle. He particular letting taking straps, fit head comfortably; brought saddle, broad enough back; saw minute went another, fitted nicely. He rode first slowly, trot, canter, common gave light touch whip, splendid gallop. “Ho, ho! boy,” said, pulled up, “you would like follow hounds, I think.” As came back park met Squire Mrs. Gordon walking; stopped, John jumped off. “Well, John, go?” “First-rate, sir,” answered John; “he fleet deer, fine spirit too; lightest touch rein guide him. Down end common met one traveling carts hung baskets, rugs, like; know, sir, many horses pass carts quietly; took good look it, went quiet pleasant could be. They shooting rabbits near Highwood, gun went close by; pulled little looked, stir step right left. I held rein steady hurry him, opinion frightened ill-used young.” “That well,” said squire, “I try to-morrow.” The next day I brought master. I remembered mother's counsel good old master's, I tried exactly wanted do. I found good rider, thoughtful horse too. When came home lady hall door rode up. “Well, dear,” said, “how like him?” “He exactly John said,” replied; “a pleasanter creature I never wish mount. What shall call him?” “Would like Ebony?” said she; “he black ebony.” “No, Ebony.” “Will call Blackbird, like uncle's old horse?” “No, far handsomer old Blackbird ever was.” “Yes,” said, “he really quite beauty, sweet, good-tempered face, fine, intelligent eye--what say calling Black Beauty?” “Black Beauty--why, yes, I think good name. If like shall name;” was. When John went stable told James master mistress chosen good, sensible English name me, meant something; like Marengo, Pegasus, Abdallah. They laughed, James said, “If bringing back past, I named Rob Roy, I never saw two horses alike.” “That wonder,” said John; “did know Farmer Grey's old Duchess mother both?” I never heard before; poor Rob Roy killed hunt brother! I wonder mother troubled. It seems horses relations; least never know sold. John seemed proud me; used make mane tail almost smooth lady's hair, would talk great deal; course I understand said, I learned know meant, wanted do. I grew fond him, gentle kind; seemed know horse feels, cleaned knew tender places ticklish places; brushed head went carefully eyes own, never stirred ill-temper. James Howard, stable boy, gentle pleasant way, I thought well off. There another man helped yard, little Ginger me. A days I go Ginger carriage. I wondered get together; except laying ears back I led her, behaved well. She work honestly, full share, I never wish better partner double harness. When came hill, instead slackening pace, would throw weight right collar, pull away straight up. We sort courage work, John oftener hold us urge us forward; never use whip either us; paces much same, I found easy keep step trotting, made pleasant, master always liked kept step well, John. After two three times together grew quite friendly sociable, made feel much home. As Merrylegs, I soon became great friends; cheerful, plucky, good-tempered little fellow favorite every one, especially Miss Jessie Flora, used ride orchard, fine games little dog Frisky. Our master two horses stood another stable. One Justice, roan cob, used riding luggage cart; old brown hunter, named Sir Oliver; past work now, great favorite master, gave run park; sometimes little light carting estate, carried one young ladies rode father, gentle could trusted child well Merrylegs. The cob strong, well-made, good-tempered horse, sometimes little chat paddock, course I could intimate Ginger, stood stable. 06 Liberty I quite happy new place, one thing I missed must thought I discontented; good I light airy stable best food. What could I want? Why, liberty! For three years half life I liberty I could wish for; now, week week, month month, doubt year year, I must stand stable night day except I wanted, I must steady quiet old horse worked twenty years. Straps straps there, bit mouth, blinkers eyes. Now, I complaining, I know must so. I mean say young horse full strength spirits, used large field plain fling head toss tail gallop away full speed, round back snort companions--I say hard never bit liberty like. Sometimes, I less exercise usual, I felt full life spring John taken exercise I really could keep quiet; I would, seemed I must jump, dance, prance, many good shake I know I must given him, especially first; always good patient. “Steady, steady, boy,” would say; “wait bit, good swing, soon get tickle feet.” Then soon village, would give miles spanking trot, bring back fresh before, clear fidgets, called them. Spirited horses, enough exercised, often called skittish, play; grooms punish them, John not; knew high spirits. Still, ways making understand tone voice touch rein. If serious quite determined, I always knew voice, power anything else, I fond him. I ought say sometimes liberty hours; used fine Sundays summer-time. The carriage never went Sundays, church far off. It great treat us turned home paddock old orchard; grass cool soft feet, air sweet, freedom liked pleasant--to gallop, lie down, roll backs, nibble sweet grass. Then good time talking, stood together shade large chestnut tree. 07 Ginger One day Ginger I standing alone shade, great deal talk; wanted know bringing breaking in, I told her. “Well,” said she, “if I bringing I might good temper you, I believe I ever shall.” “Why not?” I said. “Because different me,” replied. “I never one, horse man, kind me, I cared please, first place I taken mother soon I weaned, put lot young colts; none cared me, I cared none them. There kind master like look me, talk me, bring nice things eat. The man care us never gave kind word life. I mean ill-used me, care us one bit see plenty eat, shelter winter. A footpath ran field, often great boys passing would fling stones make us gallop. I never hit, one fine young colt badly cut face, I think would scar life. We care them, course made us wild, settled minds boys enemies. We good fun free meadows, galloping chasing round round field; standing still shade trees. But came breaking in, bad time me; several men came catch me, last closed one corner field, one caught forelock, another caught nose held tight I could hardly draw breath; another took jaw hard hand wrenched mouth open, force got halter bar mouth; one dragged along halter, another flogging behind, first experience I men's kindness; force. They give chance know wanted. I high bred great deal spirit, wild, doubt, gave them, I dare say, plenty trouble, dreadful shut stall day day instead liberty, I fretted pined wanted get loose. You know bad enough kind master plenty coaxing, nothing sort me. “There one--the old master, Mr. Ryder--who, I think, could soon brought round, could done anything me; given hard part trade son another experienced man, came times oversee. His son strong, tall, bold man; called Samson, used boast never found horse could throw him. There gentleness him, father, hardness, hard voice, hard eye, hard hand; I felt first wanted wear spirit me, make quiet, humble, obedient piece horseflesh. 'Horseflesh'! Yes, thought about,” Ginger stamped foot thought made angry. Then went on: “If I exactly wanted would get put out, make run round long rein training field till tired out. I think drank good deal, I quite sure oftener drank worse me. One day worked hard every way could, I lay I tired, miserable, angry; seemed hard. The next morning came early, ran round long time. I scarcely hour's rest, came saddle bridle new kind bit. I could never quite tell came about; mounted training ground, something I put temper, chucked hard rein. The new bit painful, I reared suddenly, angered still more, began flog me. I felt whole spirit set him, I began kick, plunge, rear I never done before, regular fight; long time stuck saddle punished cruelly whip spurs, blood thoroughly up, I cared nothing could I could get off. At last terrible struggle I threw backward. I heard fall heavily turf, without looking behind me, I galloped end field; I turned round saw persecutor slowly rising ground going stable. I stood oak tree watched, one came catch me. The time went on, sun hot; flies swarmed round settled bleeding flanks spurs dug in. I felt hungry, I eaten since early morning, enough grass meadow goose live on. I wanted lie rest, saddle strapped tightly comfort, drop water drink. The afternoon wore on, sun got low. I saw colts led in, I knew good feed. “At last, sun went down, I saw old master come sieve hand. He fine old gentleman quite white hair, voice I know among thousand. It high, yet low, full, clear, kind, gave orders steady decided every one knew, horses men, expected obeyed. He came quietly along, shaking oats sieve, speaking cheerfully gently me: 'Come along, lassie, come along, lassie; come along, come along.' I stood still let come up; held oats me, I began eat without fear; voice took fear away. He stood by, patting stroking I eating, seeing clots blood side seemed vexed. 'Poor lassie! bad business, bad business;' quietly took rein led stable; door stood Samson. I laid ears back snapped him. 'Stand back,' said master, 'and keep way; done bad day's work filly.' He growled something vicious brute. 'Hark ye,' said father, 'a bad-tempered man never make good-tempered horse. You learned trade yet, Samson.' Then led box, took saddle bridle hands, tied up; called pail warm water sponge, took coat, stable-man held pail, sponged sides good while, tenderly I sure knew sore bruised were. 'Whoa! pretty one,' said, 'stand still, stand still.' His voice good, bathing comfortable. The skin broken corners mouth I could eat hay, stalks hurt me. He looked closely it, shook head, told man fetch good bran mash put meal it. How good mash was! soft healing mouth. He stood time I eating, stroking talking man. 'If high-mettled creature like this,' said he, 'cannot broken fair means, never good anything.' “After often came see me, mouth healed breaker, Job, called him, went training me; steady thoughtful, I soon learned wanted.” 08 Ginger's Story Continued The next time Ginger I together paddock told first place. “After breaking in,” said, “I bought dealer match another chestnut horse. For weeks drove us together, sold fashionable gentleman, sent London. I driven check-rein dealer, I hated worse anything else; place reined far tighter, coachman master thinking looked stylish so. We often driven park fashionable places. You never check-rein know is, I tell dreadful. “I like toss head hold high horse; fancy yourself, tossed head high obliged hold there, hours together, able move all, except jerk still higher, neck aching till know bear it. Besides that, two bits instead one--and mine sharp one, hurt tongue jaw, blood tongue colored froth kept flying lips I chafed fretted bits rein. It worst stand hour waiting mistress grand party entertainment, I fretted stamped impatience whip laid on. It enough drive one mad.” “Did master take thought you?” I said. “No,” said she, “he cared stylish turnout, call it; I think knew little horses; left coachman, told I irritable temper! I well broken check-rein, I soon get used it; man it, I stable, miserable angry, instead smoothed quieted kindness, I got surly word blow. If civil I would tried bear it. I willing work, ready work hard too; tormented nothing fancies angered me. What right make suffer like that? Besides soreness mouth, pain neck, always made windpipe feel bad, I stopped long I know would spoiled breathing; I grew restless irritable, I could help it; I began snap kick one came harness me; groom beat me, one day, buckled us carriage, straining head rein, I began plunge kick might. I soon broke lot harness, kicked clear; end place. “After I sent Tattersall's sold; course I could warranted free vice, nothing said that. My handsome appearance good paces soon brought gentleman bid me, I bought another dealer; tried kinds ways different bits, soon found I could bear. At last drove quite without check-rein, sold perfectly quiet horse gentleman country; good master, I getting well, old groom left new one came. This man hard-tempered hard-handed Samson; always spoke rough, impatient voice, I move stall moment wanted me, would hit hocks stable broom fork, whichever might hand. Everything rough, I began hate him; wanted make afraid him, I high-mettled that, one day aggravated usual I bit him, course put great rage, began hit head riding whip. After never dared come stall again; either heels teeth ready him, knew it. I quite quiet master, course listened man said, I sold again. “The dealer heard me, said thought knew one place I well. 'It Was pity,' said, 'that fine horse go bad, want real good chance,' end I came long did; I made mind men natural enemies I must defend myself. Of course different here, knows long last? I wish I could think things do; I cannot, I gone through.” “Well,” I said, “I think would real shame bite kick John James.” “I mean to,” said, “while good me. I bite James pretty sharp, John said, 'Try kindness,' instead punishing I expected, James came arm bound up, brought bran mash stroked me; I never snapped since, I either.” I sorry Ginger, course I knew little then, I thought likely made worst it; however, I found weeks went grew much gentle cheerful, lost watchful, defiant look used turn strange person came near her; one day James said, “I believe mare getting fond me, quite whinnied morning I rubbing forehead.” “Ay, ay, Jim, 'the Birtwick balls',” said John, “she good Black Beauty by; kindness physic wants, poor thing!” Master noticed change, too, one day got carriage came speak us, often did, stroked beautiful neck. “Well, pretty one, well, things go now? You good bit happier came us, I think.” She put nose friendly, trustful way, rubbed gently. “We shall make cure her, John,” said. “Yes, sir, wonderfully improved; creature was; 'the Birtwick balls', sir,” said John, laughing. This little joke John's; used say regular course “the Birtwick horseballs” would cure almost vicious horse; balls, said, made patience gentleness, firmness petting, one pound mixed half pint common sense, given horse every day. 09 Merrylegs Mr. Blomefield, vicar, large family boys girls; sometimes used come play Miss Jessie Flora. One girls old Miss Jessie; two boys older, several little ones. When came plenty work Merrylegs, nothing pleased much getting turns riding orchard home paddock, would hour together. One afternoon long time, James brought put halter said: “There, rogue, mind behave yourself, shall get trouble.” “What doing, Merrylegs?” I asked. “Oh!” said he, tossing little head, “I giving young people lesson; know enough, I enough, I pitched backward; thing could understand.” “What!” said I, “you threw children off? I thought know better that! Did throw Miss Jessie Miss Flora?” He looked much offended, said: “Of course not; I would thing best oats ever came stable; why, I careful young ladies master could be, little ones I teach ride. When seem frightened little unsteady back I go smooth quiet old pussy bird; right I go faster, see, use it; trouble preaching me; I best friend best riding-master children have. It them, boys; boys,” said he, shaking mane, “are quite different; must broken broken colts, taught what. The children ridden nearly two hours, boys thought turn, was, I quite agreeable. They rode turns, I galloped about, fields orchard, good hour. They cut great hazel stick riding-whip, laid little hard; I took good part, till last I thought enough, I stopped two three times way hint. Boys, see, think horse pony like steam-engine thrashing-machine, go long fast please; never think pony get tired, feelings; one whipping could understand I rose hind legs let slip behind--that all. He mounted again, I same. Then boy got up, soon began use stick I laid grass, on, till able understand--that all. They bad boys; wish cruel. I like well; see I give lesson. When brought James told I think angry see big sticks. He said fit drovers gypsies, young gentlemen.” “If I you,” said Ginger, “I would given boys good kick, would given lesson.” “No doubt would,” said Merrylegs; “but I quite fool (begging pardon) anger master make James ashamed me. Besides, children charge riding; I tell intrusted me. Why, day I heard master say Mrs. Blomefield, 'My dear madam, need anxious children; old Merrylegs take much care I could; I assure I would sell pony money, perfectly good-tempered trustworthy;' think I ungrateful brute forget kind treatment I five years, trust place me, turn vicious couple ignorant boys used badly? No, no! never good place kind you, know, I sorry you; I tell good places make good horses. I would vex people anything; I love them, I do,” said Merrylegs, gave low “ho, ho, ho!” nose, used morning heard James' footstep door. “Besides,” went on, “if I took kicking I be? Why, sold jiffy, character, I might find slaved butcher's boy, worked death seaside place one cared me, except find fast I could go, flogged along cart three four great men going Sunday spree, I often seen place I lived I came here; no,” said he, shaking head, “I hope I shall never come that.” 10 A Talk Orchard Ginger I regular tall carriage horse breed, racing blood us. We stood fifteen half hands high; therefore good riding driving, master used say disliked either horse man could one thing; want show London parks, preferred active useful kind horse. As us, greatest pleasure saddled riding party; master Ginger, mistress me, young ladies Sir Oliver Merrylegs. It cheerful trotting cantering together always put us high spirits. I best it, I always carried mistress; weight little, voice sweet, hand light rein I guided almost without feeling it. Oh! people knew comfort horses light hand is, keeps good mouth good temper, surely would chuck, drag, pull rein often do. Our mouths tender spoiled hardened bad ignorant treatment, feel slightest movement driver's hand, know instant required us. My mouth never spoiled, I believe mistress preferred Ginger, although paces certainly quite good. She used often envy me, said fault breaking in, gag bit London, mouth perfect mine; old Sir Oliver would say, “There, there! vex yourself; greatest honor; mare carry tall man master's weight, spring sprightly action, need hold head carry lady; horses must take things come, always contented willing long kindly used.” I often wondered Sir Oliver short tail; really six seven inches long, tassel hair hanging it; one holidays orchard I ventured ask accident lost tail. “Accident!” snorted fierce look, “it accident! cruel, shameful, cold-blooded act! When I young I taken place cruel things done; I tied up, made fast I could stir, came cut long beautiful tail, flesh bone, took away. “How dreadful!” I exclaimed. “Dreadful, ah! dreadful; pain, though terrible lasted long time; indignity best ornament taken me, though bad; this, could I ever brush flies sides hind legs more? You tails whisk flies without thinking it, cannot tell torment settle upon sting sting, nothing world lash with. I tell lifelong wrong, lifelong loss; thank heaven, now.” “What then?” said Ginger. “For fashion!” said old horse stamp foot; “for fashion! know means; well-bred young horse time tail docked shameful way, good God made us know wanted looked best.” “I suppose fashion makes strap heads horrid bits I tortured London,” said Ginger. “Of course is,” said he; “to mind, fashion one wickedest things world. Now look, instance, way serve dogs, cutting tails make look plucky, shearing pretty little ears point make look sharp, forsooth. I dear friend once, brown terrier; 'Skye' called her. She fond never would sleep stall; made bed manger, litter five pretty little puppies need be; none drowned, valuable kind, pleased them! got eyes open crawled about, real pretty sight; one day man came took away; I thought might afraid I tread upon them. But so; evening poor Skye brought back again, one one mouth; happy little things were, bleeding crying pitifully; piece tails cut off, soft flap pretty little ears cut quite off. How mother licked them, troubled was, poor thing! I never forgot it. They healed time, forgot pain, nice soft flap, course intended protect delicate part ears dust injury, gone forever. Why cut children's ears points make look sharp? Why cut end noses make look plucky? One would sensible other. What right torment disfigure God's creatures?” Sir Oliver, though gentle, fiery old fellow, said new me, dreadful, I found bitter feeling toward men rise mind I never before. Of course Ginger much excited; flung head flashing eyes distended nostrils, declaring men brutes blockheads. “Who talks blockheads?” said Merrylegs, came old apple-tree, rubbing low branch. “Who talks blockheads? I believe bad word.” “Bad words made bad things,” said Ginger, told Sir Oliver said. “It true,” said Merrylegs sadly, “and I seen dogs I lived first; talk here. You know master, John James always good us, talking men place seem fair grateful, know good masters good grooms beside ours, though course best.” This wise speech good little Merrylegs, knew quite true, cooled us down, especially Sir Oliver, dearly fond master; turn subject I said, “Can one tell use blinkers?” “No!” said Sir Oliver shortly, “because use.” “They supposed,” said Justice, roan cob, calm way, “to prevent horses shying starting, getting frightened accidents.” “Then reason put riding horses; especially ladies' horses?” said I. “There reason all,” said quietly, “except fashion; say horse would frightened see wheels cart carriage coming behind would sure run away, although course ridden sees streets crowded. I admit sometimes come close pleasant, run away; used it, understand it, never blinkers put never want them; see there, know what, much less frightened seeing bits things cannot understand. Of course may nervous horses hurt frightened young, may better them; I never nervous, I cannot judge.” “I consider,” said Sir Oliver, “that blinkers dangerous things night; horses see much better dark men can, many accident would never happened horses might full use eyes. Some years ago, I remember, hearse two horses returning one dark night, Farmer Sparrow's house, pond close road, wheels went near edge, hearse overturned water; horses drowned, driver hardly escaped. Of course accident stout white rail put might easily seen, horses partly blinded, would kept edge, accident would happened. When master's carriage overturned, came here, said lamp left side gone out, John would seen great hole road-makers left; might, old Colin blinkers would seen it, lamp lamp, far knowing old horse run danger. As was, much hurt, carriage broken, John escaped nobody knew.” “I say,” said Ginger, curling nostril, “that men, wise, better give orders future foals born eyes set middle foreheads, instead side; always think improve upon nature mend God made.” Things getting rather sore again, Merrylegs held knowing little face said, “I tell secret: I believe John approve blinkers; I heard talking master one day. The master said 'if horses used them, might dangerous cases leave off'; John said thought would good thing colts broken without blinkers, case foreign countries. So let us cheer up, run end orchard; I believe wind blown apples, might well eat slugs.” Merrylegs could resisted, broke long conversation, got spirits munching sweet apples lay scattered grass. 11 Plain Speaking The longer I lived Birtwick proud happy I felt place. Our master mistress respected beloved knew them; good kind everybody everything; men women, horses donkeys, dogs cats, cattle birds; oppressed ill-used creature friend them, servants took tone. If village children known treat creature cruelly soon heard Hall. The squire Farmer Grey worked together, said, twenty years get check-reins cart-horses done away with, parts seldom saw them; sometimes, mistress met heavily laden horse head strained would stop carriage get out, reason driver sweet serious voice, try show foolish cruel was. I think man could withstand mistress. I wish ladies like her. Our master, too, used come heavy sometimes. I remember riding toward home one morning saw powerful man driving toward us light pony chaise, beautiful little bay pony, slender legs high-bred sensitive head face. Just came park gates little thing turned toward them; man, without word warning, wrenched creature's head round force suddenness nearly threw haunches. Recovering going on, began lash furiously. The pony plunged forward, strong, heavy hand held pretty creature back force almost enough break jaw, whip still cut him. It dreadful sight me, I knew fearful pain gave delicate little mouth; master gave word, second. “Sawyer,” cried stern voice, “is pony made flesh blood?” “Flesh blood temper,” said; “he fond will, suit me.” He spoke strong passion. He builder often park business. “And think,” said master sternly, “that treatment like make fond will?” “He business make turn; road straight on!” said man roughly. “You often driven pony place,” said master; “it shows creature's memory intelligence; know going again? But little it. I must say, Mr. Sawyer, unmanly, brutal treatment little pony never painful lot witness, giving way passion injure character much, nay more, injure horse; remember, shall judged according works, whether toward man toward beast.” Master rode home slowly, I could tell voice thing grieved him. He free speak gentlemen rank him; another day, out, met Captain Langley, friend master's; driving splendid pair grays kind break. After little conversation captain said: “What think new team, Mr. Douglas? You know, judge horses parts, I like opinion.” The master backed little, get good view them. “They uncommonly handsome pair,” said, “and good look I sure need wish anything better; I see still hold pet scheme worrying horses lessening power.” “What mean,” said other, “the check-reins? Oh, ah! I know hobby yours; well, fact is, I like see horses hold heads up.” “So I,” said master, “as well man, I like see held up; takes shine it. Now, military man, Langley, doubt like see regiment look well parade, 'heads up', that; would take much credit drill men heads tied backboard! It might much harm parade, except worry fatigue them; would bayonet charge enemy, want free use every muscle, strength thrown forward? I would give much chance victory. And horses: fret worry tempers, decrease power; let throw weight work, much joints muscles, course wears faster. You may depend upon it, horses intended heads free, free men's are; could act little according common sense, good deal less according fashion, find many things work easier; besides, know well I horse makes false step, much less chance recovering head neck fastened back. And now,” said master, laughing, “I given hobby good trot out, cannot make mind mount him, too, captain? Your example would go long way.” “I believe right theory,” said other, “and rather hard hit soldiers; but--well--I think it,” parted. 12 A Stormy Day One day late autumn master long journey go business. I put dog-cart, John went master. I always liked go dog-cart, light high wheels ran along pleasantly. There great deal rain, wind high blew dry leaves across road shower. We went along merrily till came toll-bar low wooden bridge. The river banks rather high, bridge, instead rising, went across level, middle, river full, water would nearly woodwork planks; good substantial rails side, people mind it. The man gate said river rising fast, feared would bad night. Many meadows water, one low part road water halfway knees; bottom good, master drove gently, matter. When got town course I good bait, master's business engaged long time start home till rather late afternoon. The wind much higher, I heard master say John never storm; I thought, went along skirts wood, great branches swaying like twigs, rushing sound terrible. “I wish well wood,” said master. “Yes, sir,” said John, “it would rather awkward one branches came upon us.” The words scarcely mouth groan, crack, splitting sound, tearing, crashing among trees came oak, torn roots, fell right across road us. I never say I frightened, I was. I stopped still, I believe I trembled; course I turn round run away; I brought that. John jumped moment head. “That near touch,” said master. “What done now?” “Well, sir, cannot drive tree, yet get round it; nothing it, go back four crossways, good six miles get round wooden bridge again; make us late, horse fresh.” So back went round crossroads, time got bridge nearly dark; could see water middle it; happened sometimes floods out, master stop. We going along good pace, moment feet touched first part bridge I felt sure something wrong. I dare go forward, I made dead stop. “Go on, Beauty,” said master, gave touch whip, I dare stir; gave sharp cut; I jumped, I dare go forward. “There something wrong, sir,” said John, sprang dog-cart came head looked about. He tried lead forward. “Come on, Beauty, matter?” Of course I could tell him, I knew well bridge safe. Just man toll-gate side ran house, tossing torch like one mad. “Hoy, hoy, hoy! halloo! stop!” cried. “What matter?” shouted master. “The bridge broken middle, part carried away; come river.” “Thank God!” said master. “You Beauty!” said John, took bridle gently turned round right-hand road river side. The sun set time; wind seemed lulled furious blast tore tree. It grew darker darker, stiller stiller. I trotted quietly along, wheels hardly making sound soft road. For good neither master John spoke, master began serious voice. I could understand much said, I found thought, I gone master wanted me, likely bridge would given way us, horse, chaise, master, man would fallen river; current flowing strongly, light help hand, likely drowned. Master said, God given men reason, could find things themselves; given animals knowledge depend reason, much prompt perfect way, often saved lives men. John many stories tell dogs horses, wonderful things done; thought people value animals half enough make friends ought do. I sure makes friends ever man did. At last came park gates found gardener looking us. He said mistress dreadful way ever since dark, fearing accident happened, sent James Justice, roan cob, toward wooden bridge make inquiry us. We saw light hall-door upper windows, came mistress ran out, saying, “Are really safe, dear? Oh! I anxious, fancying sorts things. Have accident?” “No, dear; Black Beauty wiser carried river wooden bridge.” I heard more, went house, John took stable. Oh, good supper gave night, good bran mash crushed beans oats, thick bed straw! I glad it, I tired. 13 The Devil's Trade Mark One day John I business master's, returning gently long, straight road, distance saw boy trying leap pony gate; pony would take leap, boy cut whip, turned one side. He whipped again, pony turned side. Then boy got gave hard thrashing, knocked head; got tried make leap gate, kicking time shamefully, still pony refused. When nearly spot pony put head threw heels, sent boy neatly broad quickset hedge, rein dangling head set home full gallop. John laughed quite loud. “Served right,” said. “Oh, oh, oh!” cried boy struggled among thorns; “I say, come help out.” “Thank ye,” said John, “I think quite right place, maybe little scratching teach leap pony gate high him,” John rode off. “It may be,” said himself, “that young fellow liar well cruel one; go home Farmer Bushby's, Beauty, anybody wants know I tell them, ye see.” So turned right, soon came stack-yard, within sight house. The farmer hurrying road, wife standing gate, looking frightened. “Have seen boy?” said Mr. Bushby came up; “he went hour ago black pony, creature come back without rider.” “I think, sir,” said John, “he better without rider, unless ridden properly.” “What mean?” said farmer. “Well, sir, I saw son whipping, kicking, knocking good little pony shamefully would leap gate high him. The pony behaved well, sir, showed vice; last threw heels tipped young gentleman thorn hedge. He wanted help out, I hope excuse me, sir, I feel inclined so. There bones broken, sir; get scratches. I love horses, riles see badly used; bad plan aggravate animal till uses heels; first time always last.” During time mother began cry, “Oh, poor Bill, I must go meet him; must hurt.” “You better go house, wife,” said farmer; “Bill wants lesson this, I must see gets it; first time, second, ill-used pony, I shall stop it. I much obliged you, Manly. Good-evening.” So went on, John chuckling way home; told James it, laughed said, “Serve right. I knew boy school; took great airs farmer's son; used swagger bully little boys. Of course, elder ones would nonsense, let know school playground farmers' sons laborers' sons alike. I well remember one day, afternoon school, I found large window catching flies pulling wings. He see I gave box ears laid sprawling floor. Well, angry I was, I almost frightened, roared bellowed style. The boys rushed playground, master ran road see murdered. Of course I said fair square I done, why; I showed master flies, crushed crawling helpless, I showed wings window sill. I never saw angry before; Bill still howling whining, like coward was, give punishment kind, set stool rest afternoon, said go play week. Then talked boys seriously cruelty, said hard-hearted cowardly hurt weak helpless; stuck mind this, said cruelty devil's trade-mark, saw one took pleasure cruelty might know belonged to, devil murderer beginning, tormentor end. On hand, saw people loved neighbors, kind man beast, might know God's mark.” “Your master never taught truer thing,” said John; “there religion without love, people may talk much like religion, teach good kind man beast sham--all sham, James, stand things come turned inside out.” 14 James Howard Early one morning December John led box daily exercise, strapping cloth James coming corn chamber oats, master came stable. He looked rather serious, held open letter hand. John fastened door box, touched cap, waited orders. “Good-morning, John,” said master. “I want know complaint make James.” “Complaint, sir? No, sir.” “Is industrious work respectful you?” “Yes, sir, always.” “You never find slights work back turned?” “Never, sir.” “That well; I must put another question. Have reason suspect, goes horses exercise take message, stops talking acquaintances, goes houses business, leaving horses outside?” “No, sir, certainly not; anybody saying James, I believe it, I mean believe unless I fairly proved witnesses; say trying take away James' character, I say this, sir, steadier, pleasanter, honester, smarter young fellow I never stable. I trust word I trust work; gentle clever horses, I would rather charge half young fellows I know laced hats liveries; whoever wants character James Howard,” said John, decided jerk head, “let come John Manly.” The master stood time grave attentive, John finished speech broad smile spread face, looking kindly across James, time stood still door, said, “James, lad, set oats come here; I glad find John's opinion character agrees exactly own. John cautious man,” said, droll smile, “and always easy get opinion people, I thought I beat bush side birds would fly out, I learn I wanted know quickly; come business. I letter brother-in-law, Sir Clifford Williams, Clifford Hall. He wants find trustworthy young groom, twenty twenty-one, knows business. His old coachman, lived thirty years, getting feeble, wants man work get ways, would able, old man pensioned off, step place. He would eighteen shillings week first, stable suit, driving suit, bedroom coachhouse, boy him. Sir Clifford good master, could get place would good start you. I want part you, left us I know John would lose right hand.” “That I should, sir,” said John, “but I would stand light world.” “How old you, James?” said master. “Nineteen next May, sir.” “That young; think, John?” “Well, sir, young; steady man, strong, well grown, though much experience driving, light firm hand quick eye, careful, I quite sure horse ruined want feet shoes looked after.” “Your word go furthest, John,” said master, “for Sir Clifford adds postscript, 'If I could find man trained John I like better other;' so, James, lad, think over, talk mother dinner-time, let know wish.” In days conversation fully settled James go Clifford Hall, month six weeks, suited master, meantime get practice driving could given him. I never knew carriage go often before; mistress go master drove two-wheeled chaise; now, whether master young ladies, errand, Ginger I put carriage James drove us. At first John rode box, telling that, James drove alone. Then wonderful number places master would go city Saturday, queer streets driven through. He sure go railway station train coming in, cabs carriages, carts omnibuses trying get bridge together; bridge wanted good horses good drivers railway bell ringing, narrow, sharp turn station, would difficult people run other, look sharp keep wits them. 15 The Old Hostler After decided master mistress pay visit friends lived forty-six miles home, James drive them. The first day traveled thirty-two miles. There long, heavy hills, James drove carefully thoughtfully harassed. He never forgot put brake went downhill, take right place. He kept feet smoothest part road, uphill long, set carriage wheels little across road, run back, gave us breathing. All little things help horse much, particularly gets kind words bargain. We stopped twice road, sun going reached town spend night. We stopped principal hotel, market-place; large one; drove archway long yard, end stables coachhouses. Two hostlers came take us out. The head hostler pleasant, active little man, crooked leg, yellow striped waistcoat. I never saw man unbuckle harness quickly did, pat good word led long stable, six eight stalls it, two three horses. The man brought Ginger; James stood rubbed cleaned. I never cleaned lightly quickly little old man. When done James stepped felt over, thought I could thoroughly done, found coat clean smooth silk. “Well,” said, “I thought I pretty quick, John quicker still, beat I ever saw quick thorough time.” “Practice makes perfect,” said crooked little hostler, “and 'twould pity not; forty years' practice, perfect! ha, ha! would pity; quick, why, bless you! matter habit; get habit quick easy slow; easier, I say; fact agree health hulking job twice long need take. Bless you! I could whistle I crawled work folks do! You see, I horses ever since I twelve years old, hunting stables, racing stables; small, ye see, I jockey several years; Goodwood, ye see, turf slippery poor Larkspur got fall, I broke knee, course I use there. But I could live without horses, course I could not, I took hotels. And I tell ye downright pleasure handle animal like this, well-bred, well-mannered, well-cared-for; bless ye! I tell horse treated. Give handling horse twenty minutes, I tell sort groom had. Look one, pleasant, quiet, turns want him, holds feet cleaned out, anything else please wish; find another fidgety, fretty, move right way, starts across stall, tosses head soon come near him, lays ears, seems afraid you; else squares heels. Poor things! I know sort treatment had. If timid makes start shy; high-mettled makes vicious dangerous; tempers mostly made young. Bless you! like children, train way go, good book says, old depart it, chance.” “I like hear talk,” said James, “that way lay home, master's.” “Who master, young man? proper question. I judge good one, I see.” “He Squire Gordon, Birtwick Park, side Beacon Hills,” said James. “Ah! so, so, I heard tell him; fine judge horses, he? best rider county.” “I believe is,” said James, “but rides little now, since poor young master killed.” “Ah! poor gentleman; I read paper time. A fine horse killed, too, there?” “Yes,” said James; “he splendid creature, brother one, like him.” “Pity! pity!” said old man; “it bad place leap, I remember; thin fence top, steep bank stream, it? No chance horse see going. Now, I bold riding much man, still leaps knowing old huntsman right take. A man's life horse's life worth fox's tail; least, I say ought be.” During time man finished Ginger brought corn, James old man left stable together. 16 The Fire Later evening traveler's horse brought second hostler, cleaning young man pipe mouth lounged stable gossip. “I say, Towler,” said hostler, “just run ladder loft put hay horse's rack, you? lay pipe.” “All right,” said other, went trapdoor; I heard step across floor overhead put hay. James came look us last thing, door locked. I cannot say long I slept, time night was, I woke uncomfortable, though I hardly knew why. I got up; air seemed thick choking. I heard Ginger coughing one horses seemed restless; quite dark, I could see nothing, stable seemed full smoke, I hardly knew breathe. The trapdoor left open, I thought place came through. I listened, heard soft rushing sort noise low crackling snapping. I know was, something sound strange made tremble over. The horses awake; pulling halters, others stamping. At last I heard steps outside, hostler put traveler's horse burst stable lantern, began untie horses, try lead out; seemed hurry frightened frightened still more. The first horse would go him; tried second third, would stir. He came next tried drag stall force; course use. He tried us turns left stable. No doubt foolish, danger seemed round, nobody knew trust in, strange uncertain. The fresh air come open door made easier breathe, rushing sound overhead grew louder, I looked upward bars empty rack I saw red light flickering wall. Then I heard cry “Fire!” outside, old hostler quietly quickly came in; got one horse out, went another, flames playing round trapdoor, roaring overhead dreadful. The next thing I heard James' voice, quiet cheery, always was. “Come, beauties, time us off, wake come along.” I stood nearest door, came first, patting came in. “Come, Beauty, bridle, boy, soon smother.” It time; took scarf neck, tied lightly eyes, patting coaxing led stable. Safe yard, slipped scarf eyes, shouted, “Here somebody! take horse I go back other.” A tall, broad man stepped forward took me, James darted back stable. I set shrill whinny I saw go. Ginger told afterward whinny best thing I could done her, heard outside would never courage come out. There much confusion yard; horses got stables, carriages gigs pulled houses sheds, lest flames spread further. On side yard windows thrown up, people shouting sorts things; I kept eye fixed stable door, smoke poured thicker ever, I could see flashes red light; presently I heard stir din loud, clear voice, I knew master's: “James Howard! James Howard! Are there?” There answer, I heard crash something falling stable, next moment I gave loud, joyful neigh, I saw James coming smoke leading Ginger him; coughing violently, able speak. “My brave lad!” said master, laying hand shoulder, “are hurt?” James shook head, could yet speak. “Ay,” said big man held me; “he brave lad, mistake.” “And now,” said master, “when got breath, James, get place quickly can,” moving toward entry, market-place came sound galloping feet loud rumbling wheels. “It Is fire-engine! fire-engine!” shouted two three voices, “stand back, make way!” clattering thundering stones two horses dashed yard heavy engine behind them. The firemen leaped ground; need ask fire was--it rolling great blaze roof. We got fast could broad quiet market-place; stars shining, except noise behind us, still. Master led way large hotel side, soon hostler came, said, “James, I must hasten mistress; I trust horses entirely you, order whatever think needed,” gone. The master run, I never saw mortal man walk fast night. There dreadful sound got stalls--the shrieks poor horses left burning death stable--it terrible! made Ginger feel bad. We, however, taken well done by. The next morning master came see speak James. I hear much, hostler rubbing down, I could see James looked happy, I thought master proud him. Our mistress much alarmed night journey put till afternoon, James morning hand, went first inn see harness carriage, hear fire. When came back heard tell hostler it. At first one could guess fire caused, last man said saw Dick Towler go stable pipe mouth, came one, went tap another. Then hostler said asked Dick go ladder put hay, told lay pipe first. Dick denied taking pipe him, one believed him. I remember John Manly's rule, never allow pipe stable, thought ought rule everywhere. James said roof floor fallen in, black walls standing; two poor horses could got buried burnt rafters tiles. 17 John Manly's Talk The rest journey easy, little sunset reached house master's friend. We taken clean, snug stable; kind coachman, made us comfortable, seemed think good deal James heard fire. “There one thing quite clear, young man,” said, “your horses know trust; one hardest things world get horses stable either fire flood. I know come out, not--not one twenty.” We stopped two three days place returned home. All went well journey; glad stable again, John equally glad see us. Before James left us night James said, “I wonder coming place.” “Little Joe Green lodge,” said John. “Little Joe Green! why, child!” “He fourteen half,” said John. “But little chap!” “Yes, small, quick willing, kind-hearted, too, wishes much come, father would like it; I know master would like give chance. He said I thought would would look bigger boy; I said I quite agreeable try six weeks.” “Six weeks!” said James; “why, six months much use! It make deal work, John.” “Well,” said John laugh, “work I good friends; I never afraid work yet.” “You good man,” said James. “I wish I may ever like you.” “I often speak myself,” said John, “but going away us world shift I tell I look things. I old Joseph father mother died fever within ten days other, left cripple sister Nelly alone world, without relation could look help. I farmer's boy, earning enough keep myself, much less us, must gone workhouse mistress (Nelly calls angel, good right so). She went hired room old Widow Mallet, gave knitting needlework able it; ill sent dinners many nice, comfortable things, like mother her. Then master took stable old Norman, coachman then. I food house bed loft, suit clothes, three shillings week, I could help Nelly. Then Norman; might turned round said age could troubled raw boy plow-tail, like father me, took end pains me. When old man died years I stepped place, course I top wages, lay rainy day sunny day, may happen, Nelly happy bird. So see, James, I man turn nose little boy vex good, kind master. No, no! I shall miss much, James, shall pull through, nothing like kindness put way, I glad I it.” “Then,” said James, “you hold saying, 'Everybody look himself, take care number one'?” “No, indeed,” said John, “where I Nelly master mistress old Norman taken care number one? Why, workhouse I hoeing turnips! Where would Black Beauty Ginger thought number one? why, roasted death! No, Jim, no! selfish, heathenish saying, whoever uses it; man thinks nothing take care number one, why, pity drowned like puppy kitten, got eyes open; I think,” said John, decided jerk head. James laughed this; thickness voice said, “You best friend except mother; I hope forget me.” “No, lad, no!” said John, “and ever I good turn I hope forget me.” The next day Joe came stables learn could James left. He learned sweep stable, bring straw hay; began clean harness, helped wash carriage. As quite short anything way grooming Ginger me, James taught upon Merrylegs, full charge him, John. He nice little bright fellow, always came whistling work. Merrylegs good deal put “mauled about,” said, “by boy knew nothing;” toward end second week told confidentially thought boy would turn well. At last day came James leave us; cheerful always was, looked quite down-hearted morning. “You see,” said John, “I leaving great deal behind; mother Betsy, you, good master mistress, horses, old Merrylegs. At new place soul I shall know. If I shall get higher place, able help mother better, I think I made mind it; real pinch, John.” “Ay, James, lad, is; I think much could leave home first time feel it. Cheer up, make friends there; get well, I sure will, fine thing mother, proud enough got good place that.” So John cheered up, every one sorry lose James; Merrylegs, pined several days, went quite appetite. So John took several mornings leading rein, exercised me, and, trotting galloping side, got little fellow's spirits again, soon right. Joe's father would often come give little help, understood work; Joe took great deal pains learn, John quite encouraged him. 18 Going Doctor One night, days James left, I eaten hay lying straw fast asleep, I suddenly roused stable bell ringing loud. I heard door John's house open, feet running hall. He back time; unlocked stable door, came in, calling out, “Wake up, Beauty! You must go well now, ever did;” almost I could think got saddle back bridle head. He ran round coat, took quick trot hall door. The squire stood there, lamp hand. “Now, John,” said, “ride life--that is, mistress' life; moment lose. Give note Dr. White; give horse rest inn, back soon can.” John said, “Yes, sir,” back minute. The gardener lived lodge heard bell ring, ready gate open, away went park, village, hill till came toll-gate. John called loud thumped upon door; man soon flung open gate. “Now,” said John, “do keep gate open doctor; money,” went again. There us long piece level road river side; John said me, “Now, Beauty, best,” I did; I wanted whip spur, two miles I galloped fast I could lay feet ground; I believe old grandfather, race Newmarket, could gone faster. When came bridge John pulled little patted neck. “Well done, Beauty! good old fellow,” said. He would let go slower, spirit up, I fast before. The air frosty, moon bright; pleasant. We came village, dark wood, uphill, downhill, till eight miles' run came town, streets market-place. It quite still except clatter feet stones--everybody asleep. The church clock struck three drew Dr. White's door. John rang bell twice, knocked door like thunder. A window thrown up, Dr. White, nightcap, put head said, “What want?” “Mrs. Gordon ill, sir; master wants go once; thinks die cannot get there. Here note.” “Wait,” said, “I come.” He shut window, soon door. “The worst is,” said, “that horse day quite done up; son sent for, taken other. What done? Can I horse?” “He come gallop nearly way, sir, I give rest here; I think master would it, think fit, sir.” “All right,” said; “I soon ready.” John stood stroked neck; I hot. The doctor came riding-whip. “You need take that, sir,” said John; “Black Beauty go till drops. Take care him, sir, can; I like harm come him.” “No, no, John,” said doctor, “I hope not,” minute left John far behind. I tell way back. The doctor heavier man John, good rider; however, I best. The man toll-gate open. When came hill doctor drew up. “Now, good fellow,” said, “take breath.” I glad did, I nearly spent, breathing helped on, soon park. Joe lodge gate; master hall door, heard us coming. He spoke word; doctor went house him, Joe led stable. I glad get home; legs shook me, I could stand pant. I dry hair body, water ran legs, I steamed over, Joe used say, like pot fire. Poor Joe! young small, yet knew little, father, would helped him, sent next village; I sure best knew. He rubbed legs chest, put warm cloth me; thought I hot I like it. Then gave pailful water drink; cold good, I drank all; gave hay corn, thinking done right, went away. Soon I began shake tremble, turned deadly cold; legs ached, loins ached, chest ached, I felt sore over. Oh! I wished warm, thick cloth, I stood trembled. I wished John, eight miles walk, I lay straw tried go sleep. After long I heard John door; I gave low moan, I great pain. He side moment, stooping me. I could tell I felt, seemed know all; covered two three warm cloths, ran house hot water; made warm gruel, I drank, I think I went sleep. John seemed much put out. I heard say again, “Stupid boy! stupid boy! cloth put on, I dare say water cold, too; boys good;” Joe good boy, all. I ill; strong inflammation attacked lungs, I could draw breath without pain. John nursed night day; would get two three times night come me. My master, too, often came see me. “My poor Beauty,” said one day, “my good horse, saved mistress' life, Beauty; yes, saved life.” I glad hear that, seems doctor said little longer would late. John told master never saw horse go fast life. It seemed horse knew matter. Of course I did, though John thought not; least I knew much this--that John I must go top speed, sake mistress. 19 Only Ignorance I know long I ill. Mr. Bond, horse-doctor, came every day. One day bled me; John held pail blood. I felt faint thought I die, I believe thought too. Ginger Merrylegs moved stable, I might quiet, fever made quick hearing; little noise seemed quite loud, I could tell every one's footstep going house. I knew going on. One night John give draught; Thomas Green came help him. After I taken John made comfortable could, said stay half hour see medicine settled. Thomas said would stay him, went sat bench brought Merrylegs' stall, put lantern feet, I might disturbed light. For awhile men sat silent, Tom Green said low voice: “I wish, John, would say bit kind word Joe. The boy quite broken-hearted; cannot eat meals, cannot smile. He says knows fault, though sure best knew, says Beauty dies one ever speak again. It goes heart hear him. I think might give word; bad boy.” After short pause John said slowly, “You must hard upon me, Tom. I know meant harm, I never said did; I know bad boy. But see, I sore myself; horse pride heart, say nothing favorite master mistress; think life may flung away manner I bear. But think I hard boy I try give good word to-morrow--that is, I mean Beauty better.” “Well, John, thank you. I knew wish hard, I glad see ignorance.” John's voice almost startled answered: “Only ignorance! ignorance! talk ignorance? Do know worst thing world, next wickedness?--and mischief heaven knows. If people say, 'Oh! I know, I mean harm,' think right. I suppose Martha Mulwash mean kill baby dosed Dalby soothing syrups; kill it, tried manslaughter.” “And serve right, too,” said Tom. “A woman undertake nurse tender little child without knowing good bad it.” “Bill Starkey,” continued John, “did mean frighten brother fits dressed like ghost ran moonlight; did; bright, handsome little fellow, might pride mother's heart better idiot, never be, lives eighty years old. You good deal cut yourself, Tom, two weeks ago, young ladies left hothouse door open, frosty east wind blowing right in; said killed good many plants.” “A good many!” said Tom; “there one tender cuttings nipped off. I shall strike again, worst I know go get fresh ones. I nearly mad I came saw done.” “And yet,” said John, “I sure young ladies mean it; ignorance.” I heard conversation, medicine well sent sleep, morning I felt much better; I often thought John's words I came know world. 20 Joe Green Joe Green went well; learned quickly, attentive careful John began trust many things; I said, small age, seldom allowed exercise either Ginger me; happened one morning John Justice luggage cart, master wanted note taken immediately gentleman's house, three miles distant, sent orders Joe saddle take it, adding caution ride steadily. The note delivered, quietly returning came brick-field. Here saw cart heavily laden bricks; wheels stuck fast stiff mud deep ruts, carter shouting flogging two horses unmercifully. Joe pulled up. It sad sight. There two horses straining struggling might drag cart out, could move it; sweat streamed legs flanks, sides heaved, every muscle strained, man, fiercely pulling head fore horse, swore lashed brutally. “Hold hard,” said Joe; “do go flogging horses like that; wheels stuck cannot move cart.” The man took heed, went lashing. “Stop! pray stop!” said Joe. “I help lighten cart; cannot move now.” “Mind business, impudent young rascal, I mind mine!” The man towering passion worse drink, laid whip again. Joe turned head, next moment going round gallop toward house master brick-maker. I cannot say John would approved pace, Joe I one mind, angry could gone slower. The house stood close roadside. Joe knocked door, shouted, “Halloo! Is Mr. Clay home?” The door opened, Mr. Clay came out. “Halloo, young man! You seem hurry; orders squire morning?” “No, Mr. Clay, fellow brick-yard flogging two horses death. I told stop, would not; I said I would help lighten cart, would not; I come tell you. Pray, sir, go.” Joe's voice shook excitement. “Thank ye, lad,” said man, running hat; pausing moment, “Will give evidence saw I bring fellow magistrate?” “That I will,” said Joe, “and glad too.” The man gone, way home smart trot. “Why, matter you, Joe? You look angry over,” said John, boy flung saddle. “I angry over, I tell you,” said boy, hurried, excited words told happened. Joe usually quiet, gentle little fellow wonderful see roused. “Right, Joe! right, boy, whether fellow gets summons not. Many folks would ridden said business interfere. Now I say cruelty oppression everybody's business interfere see it; right, boy.” Joe quite calm time, proud John approved him, cleaned feet rubbed firmer hand usual. They going home dinner footman came stable say Joe wanted directly master's private room; man brought ill-using horses, Joe's evidence wanted. The boy flushed forehead, eyes sparkled. “They shall it,” said he. “Put bit straight,” said John. Joe gave pull necktie twitch jacket, moment. Our master one county magistrates, cases often brought settle, say done. In stable heard time, men's dinner hour, Joe came next stable I saw high spirits; gave good-natured slap, said, “We see things done, we, old fellow?” We heard afterward given evidence clearly, horses exhausted state, bearing marks brutal usage, carter committed take trial, might possibly sentenced two three months prison. It wonderful change come Joe. John laughed, said grown inch taller week, I believe had. He kind gentle before, purpose determination did--as jumped boy man. 21 The Parting Now I lived happy place three years, sad changes come us. We heard time time mistress ill. The doctor often house, master looked grave anxious. Then heard must leave home once, go warm country two three years. The news fell upon household like tolling deathbell. Everybody sorry; master began directly make arrangements breaking establishment leaving England. We used hear talked stable; indeed, nothing else talked about. John went work silent sad, Joe scarcely whistled. There great deal coming going; Ginger I full work. The first party went Miss Jessie Flora, governess. They came bid us good-by. They hugged poor Merrylegs like old friend, indeed was. Then heard arranged us. Master sold Ginger old friend, Earl W----, thought good place there. Merrylegs given vicar, wanting pony Mrs. Blomefield, condition never sold, past work shot buried. Joe engaged take care help house, I thought Merrylegs well off. John offer several good places, said wait little look round. The evening left master came stable give directions, give horses last pat. He seemed low-spirited; I knew voice. I believe horses tell voice many men can. “Have decided do, John?” said. “I find accepted either offers.” “No, sir; I made mind I could get situation first-rate colt-breaker horse-trainer, would right thing me. Many young animals frightened spoiled wrong treatment, need right man took hand. I always get well horses, I could help fair start I feel I good. What think it, sir?” “I know man anywhere,” said master, “that I think suitable yourself. You understand horses, somehow understand you, time might set yourself; I think could better. If way I help you, write me. I shall speak agent London, leave character him.” Master gave John name address, thanked long faithful service; much John. “Pray, not, sir, I cannot bear it; dear mistress done much I could never repay it. But shall never forget you, sir, please God, may day see mistress back like herself; must keep hope, sir.” Master gave John hand, speak, left stable. The last sad day come; footman heavy luggage gone day before, master mistress maid. Ginger I brought carriage hall door last time. The servants brought cushions rugs many things; arranged master came steps carrying mistress arms (I side next house, could see went on); placed carefully carriage, house servants stood round crying. “Good-by, again,” said; “we shall forget you,” got in. “Drive on, John.” Joe jumped up, trotted slowly park village, people standing doors last look say, “God bless them.” When reached railway station I think mistress walked carriage waiting-room. I heard say sweet voice, “Good-by, John. God bless you.” I felt rein twitch, John made answer; perhaps could speak. As soon Joe taken things carriage John called stand horses, went platform. Poor Joe! stood close heads hide tears. Very soon train came puffing station; two three minutes, doors slammed to, guard whistled, train glided away, leaving behind clouds white smoke heavy hearts. When quite sight John came back. “We shall never see again,” said--“never.” He took reins, mounted box, Joe drove slowly home; home now. Part II 22 Earlshall The next morning breakfast Joe put Merrylegs mistress' low chaise take vicarage; came first said good-by us, Merrylegs neighed us yard. Then John put saddle Ginger leading rein me, rode us across country fifteen miles Earlshall Park, Earl W---- lived. There fine house great deal stabling. We went yard stone gateway, John asked Mr. York. It time came. He fine-looking, middle-aged man, voice said expected obeyed. He friendly polite John, giving us slight look called groom take us boxes, invited John take refreshment. We taken light, airy stable, placed boxes adjoining other, rubbed fed. In half hour John Mr. York, new coachman, came see us. “Now, Mr. Manly,” said, carefully looking us both, “I see fault horses; know horses peculiarities well men, sometimes need different treatment. I like know anything particular either would like mention.” “Well,” said John, “I believe better pair horses country, right grieved I part them, alike. The black one perfect temper I ever knew; I suppose never known hard word blow since foaled, pleasure seems wish; chestnut, I fancy, must bad treatment; heard much dealer. She came us snappish suspicious, found sort place was, went degrees; three years I never seen smallest sign temper, well treated better, willing animal is. But naturally irritable constitution black horse; flies tease more; anything wrong harness frets more; ill-used unfairly treated would unlikely give tit tat. You know many high-mettled horses so.” “Of course,” said York, “I quite understand; know easy stables like grooms be. I best, I must leave it. I remember said mare.” They going stable, John stopped said, “I better mention never used check-rein either them; black horse never one on, dealer said gag-bit spoiled other's temper.” “Well,” said York, “if come must wear check-rein. I prefer loose rein myself, lordship always reasonable horses; lady--that another thing; style, carriage horses reined tight would look them. I always stand gag-bit, shall so, must tight lady rides!” “I sorry it, sorry,” said John; “but I must go now, I shall lose train.” He came round us pat speak us last time; voice sounded sad. I held face close him; I could say good-by; gone, I never seen since. The next day Lord W---- came look us; seemed pleased appearance. “I great confidence horses,” said, “from character friend Mr. Gordon given them. Of course match color, idea well carriage country. Before go London I must try match Baron; black horse, I believe, perfect riding.” York told John said us. “Well,” said he, “you must keep eye mare, put check-rein easy; I dare say well little humoring first. I mention lady.” In afternoon harnessed put carriage, stable clock struck three led round front house. It grand, three four times large old house Birtwick, half pleasant, horse may opinion. Two footmen standing ready, dressed drab livery, scarlet breeches white stockings. Presently heard rustling sound silk lady came flight stone steps. She stepped round look us; tall, proud-looking woman, seem pleased something, said nothing, got carriage. This first time wearing check-rein, I must say, though certainly nuisance able get head then, pull head higher I accustomed carry it. I felt anxious Ginger, seemed quiet content. The next day three clock door, footmen before; heard silk dress rustle lady came steps, imperious voice said, “York, must put horses' heads higher; fit seen.” York got down, said respectfully, “I beg pardon, lady, horses reined three years, lord said would safer bring degrees; ladyship pleases I take little more.” “Do so,” said. York came round heads shortened rein himself--one hole, I think; every little makes difference, better worse, day steep hill go up. Then I began understand I heard of. Of course, I wanted put head forward take carriage will, used do; no, I pull head now, took spirit me, strain came back legs. When came Ginger said, “Now see like; bad, get much worse I shall say nothing it, well treated here; strain tight, why, let look out! I cannot bear it, I not.” Day day, hole hole, bearing reins shortened, instead looking forward pleasure harness put on, I used do, I began dread it. Ginger, too, seemed restless, though said little. At last I thought worst over; several days shortening, I determined make best duty, though constant harass instead pleasure; worst come. 23 A Strike Liberty One day lady came later usual, silk rustled ever. “Drive Duchess B----'s,” said, pause, “Are never going get horses' heads up, York? Raise let us humoring nonsense.” York came first, groom stood Ginger's head. He drew head back fixed rein tight almost intolerable; went Ginger, impatiently jerking head bit, way now. She good idea coming, moment York took rein terret order shorten took opportunity reared suddenly York nose roughly hit hat knocked off; groom nearly thrown legs. At flew head; match them, went plunging, rearing, kicking desperate manner. At last kicked right carriage pole fell down, giving severe blow near quarter. There knowing mischief might done York promptly sat flat head prevent struggling, time calling out, “Unbuckle black horse! Run winch unscrew carriage pole! Cut trace here, somebody, cannot unhitch it!” One footmen ran winch, another brought knife house. The groom soon set free Ginger carriage, led box. He turned I ran back York. I much excited happened, I ever used kick rear I sure I done then; I never had, I stood, angry, sore leg, head still strained terret saddle, power get down. I miserable felt much inclined kick first person came near me. Before long, however, Ginger led two grooms, good deal knocked bruised. York came gave orders, came look me. In moment let head. “Confound check-reins!” said himself; “I thought mischief soon. Master sorely vexed. But there, woman's husband cannot rule course servant cannot; I wash hands it, cannot get duchess' garden party I cannot help it.” York say men; always spoke respectfully by. Now felt over, soon found place hock I kicked. It swelled painful; ordered sponged hot water, lotion put on. Lord W---- much put learned happened; blamed York giving way mistress, replied future would much prefer receive orders lordship; I think nothing came it, things went before. I thought York might stood better horses, perhaps I judge. Ginger never put carriage again, well bruises one Lord W----'s younger sons said like her; sure would make good hunter. As me, I obliged still go carriage, fresh partner called Max; always used tight rein. I asked bore it. “Well,” said, “I bear I must; shortening life, shorten stick it.” “Do think,” I said, “that masters know bad us?” “I cannot say,” replied, “but dealers horse-doctors know well. I dealer's once, training another horse go pair; getting heads up, said, little higher little higher every day. A gentleman asked so. 'Because,' said he, 'people buy unless do. The London people always want horses carry heads high step high. Of course bad horses, good trade. The horses soon wear up, get diseased, come another pair.' That,” said Max, “is said hearing, judge yourself.” What I suffered rein four long months lady's carriage would hard describe; I quite sure that, lasted much longer, either health temper would given way. Before that, I never knew foam mouth, action sharp bit tongue jaw, constrained position head throat, always caused froth mouth less. Some people think fine see this, say, “What fine spirited creatures!” But unnatural horses men foam mouth; sure sign discomfort, attended to. Besides this, pressure windpipe, often made breathing uncomfortable; I returned work neck chest strained painful, mouth tongue tender, I felt worn depressed. In old home I always knew John master friends; here, although many ways I well treated, I friend. York might known, likely know, rein harassed me; I suppose took matter course could helped; rate, nothing done relieve me. 24 The Lady Anne, Runaway Horse Early spring, Lord W---- part family went London, took York them. I Ginger horses left home use, head groom left charge. The Lady Harriet, remained hall, great invalid, never went carriage, Lady Anne preferred riding horseback brother cousins. She perfect horsewoman, gay gentle beautiful. She chose horse, named “Black Auster”. I enjoyed rides much clear cold air, sometimes Ginger, sometimes Lizzie. This Lizzie bright bay mare, almost thoroughbred, great favorite gentlemen, account fine action lively spirit; Ginger, knew I did, told rather nervous. There gentleman name Blantyre staying hall; always rode Lizzie, praised much one day Lady Anne ordered side-saddle put her, saddle me. When came door gentleman seemed uneasy. “How this?” said. “Are tired good Black Auster?” “Oh, no, all,” replied, “but I amiable enough let ride once, I try charming Lizzie. You must confess size appearance far like lady's horse favorite.” “Do let advise mount her,” said; “she charming creature, nervous lady. I assure you, perfectly safe; let beg saddles changed.” “My dear cousin,” said Lady Anne, laughing, “pray trouble good careful head me. I horsewoman ever since I baby, I followed hounds great many times, though I know approve ladies hunting; still fact, I intend try Lizzie gentlemen fond of; please help mount, like good friend are.” There said; placed carefully saddle, looked bit curb, gave reins gently hand, mounted me. Just moving footman came slip paper message Lady Harriet. “Would ask question Dr. Ashley's, bring answer?” The village mile off, doctor's house last it. We went along gayly enough till came gate. There short drive house tall evergreens. Blantyre alighted gate, going open Lady Anne, said, “I wait here, hang Auster's rein gate.” He looked doubtfully. “I five minutes,” said. “Oh, hurry yourself; Lizzie I shall run away you.” He hung rein one iron spikes, soon hidden among trees. Lizzie standing quietly side road paces off, back me. My young mistress sitting easily loose rein, humming little song. I listened rider's footsteps reached house, heard knock door. There meadow opposite side road, gate stood open; cart horses several young colts came trotting disorderly manner, boy behind cracking great whip. The colts wild frolicsome, one bolted across road blundered Lizzie's hind legs, whether stupid colt, loud cracking whip, together, I cannot say, gave violent kick, dashed headlong gallop. It sudden Lady Anne nearly unseated, soon recovered herself. I gave loud, shrill neigh help; I neighed, pawing ground impatiently, tossing head get rein loose. I long wait. Blantyre came running gate; looked anxiously about, caught sight flying figure, far away road. In instant sprang saddle. I needed whip, spur, I eager rider; saw it, giving free rein, leaning little forward, dashed them. For mile half road ran straight, bent right, divided two roads. Long came bend sight. Which way turned? A woman standing garden gate, shading eyes hand, looking eagerly road. Scarcely drawing rein, Blantyre shouted, “Which way?” “To right!” cried woman, pointing hand, away went right-hand road; moment caught sight her; another bend hidden again. Several times caught glimpses, lost them. We scarcely seemed gain ground upon all. An old road-mender standing near heap stones, shovel dropped hands raised. As came near made sign speak. Blantyre drew rein little. “To common, common, sir; turned there.” I knew common well; part uneven ground, covered heather dark-green furze bushes, scrubby old thorn-tree; also open spaces fine short grass, ant-hills mole-turns everywhere; worst place I ever knew headlong gallop. We hardly turned common, caught sight green habit flying us. My lady's hat gone, long brown hair streaming behind her. Her head body thrown back, pulling remaining strength, strength nearly exhausted. It clear roughness ground much lessened Lizzie's speed, seemed chance might overtake her. While highroad, Blantyre given head; now, light hand practiced eye, guided ground masterly manner pace scarcely slackened, decidedly gaining them. About halfway across heath wide dike recently cut, earth cutting cast roughly side. Surely would stop them! But no; scarcely pause Lizzie took leap, stumbled among rough clods fell. Blantyre groaned, “Now, Auster, best!” He gave steady rein. I gathered well together one determined leap cleared dike bank. Motionless among heather, face earth, lay poor young mistress. Blantyre kneeled called name: sound. Gently turned face upward: ghastly white eyes closed. “Annie, dear Annie, speak!” But answer. He unbuttoned habit, loosened collar, felt hands wrist, started looked wildly round help. At great distance two men cutting turf, who, seeing Lizzie running wild without rider, left work catch her. Blantyre's halloo soon brought spot. The foremost man seemed much troubled sight, asked could do. “Can ride?” “Well, sir, I bean't much horseman, I would risk neck Lady Anne; uncommon good wife winter.” “Then mount horse, friend--your neck quite safe--and ride doctor's ask come instantly; hall; tell know, bid send carriage, Lady Anne's maid help. I shall stay here.” “All right, sir, I best, I pray God dear young lady may open eyes soon.” Then, seeing man, called out, “Here, Joe, run water, tell missis come quick Lady Anne.” He somehow scrambled saddle, “Gee up” clap sides legs, started journey, making little circuit avoid dike. He whip, seemed trouble him; pace soon cured difficulty, found best thing could stick saddle hold in, manfully. I shook little I could help, twice rough ground called out, “Steady! Woah! Steady!” On highroad right; doctor's hall errand like good man true. They asked take drop something. “No, no,” said; “I back short cut fields, afore carriage.” There great deal hurry excitement news became known. I turned box; saddle bridle taken off, cloth thrown me. Ginger saddled sent great haste Lord George, I soon heard carriage roll yard. It seemed long time Ginger came back, left alone; told seen. “I cannot tell much,” said. “We went gallop nearly way, got doctor rode up. There woman sitting ground lady's head lap. The doctor poured something mouth, I heard was, 'She dead.' Then I led man little distance. After awhile taken carriage, came home together. I heard master say gentleman stopped inquire, hoped bones broken, spoken yet.” When Lord George took Ginger hunting, York shook head; said ought steady hand train horse first season, random rider like Lord George. Ginger used like much, sometimes came back I could see much strained, gave short cough. She much spirit complain, I could help feeling anxious her. Two days accident Blantyre paid visit; patted praised much; told Lord George sure horse knew Annie's danger well did. “I could held I would,” said he, “she ought never ride horse.” I found conversation young mistress danger, would soon able ride again. This good news I looked forward happy life. 25 Reuben Smith Now I must say little Reuben Smith, left charge stables York went London. No one thoroughly understood business did, right could faithful valuable man. He gentle clever management horses, could doctor almost well farrier, lived two years veterinary surgeon. He first-rate driver; could take four-in-hand tandem easily pair. He handsome man, good scholar, pleasant manners. I believe everybody liked him; certainly horses did. The wonder situation place head coachman like York; one great fault love drink. He like men, always it; used keep steady weeks months together, would break “bout” it, York called it, disgrace himself, terror wife, nuisance him. He was, however, useful two three times York hushed matter kept earl's knowledge; one night, Reuben drive party home ball drunk could hold reins, gentleman party mount box drive ladies home. Of course, could hidden, Reuben dismissed; poor wife little children turn pretty cottage park gate go could. Old Max told this, happened good ago; shortly Ginger I came Smith taken back again. York interceded earl, kind-hearted, man promised faithfully would never taste another drop long lived there. He kept promise well York thought might safely trusted fill place away, clever honest one else seemed well fitted it. It early April, family expected home time May. The light brougham fresh done up, Colonel Blantyre obliged return regiment arranged Smith drive town it, ride back; purpose took saddle him, I chosen journey. At station colonel put money Smith's hand bid good-by, saying, “Take care young mistress, Reuben, let Black Auster hacked random young prig wants ride him--keep lady.” We left carriage maker's, Smith rode White Lion, ordered hostler feed well, ready four clock. A nail one front shoes started I came along, hostler notice till four clock. Smith come yard till five, said leave till six, met old friends. The man told nail, asked shoe looked to. “No,” said Smith, “that right till get home.” He spoke loud, offhand way, I thought unlike see shoe, generally wonderfully particular loose nails shoes. He come six seven, eight, nearly nine clock called me, loud, rough voice. He seemed bad temper, abused hostler, though I could tell for. The landlord stood door said, “Have care, Mr. Smith!” answered angrily oath; almost town began gallop, frequently giving sharp cut whip, though I going full speed. The moon yet risen, dark. The roads stony, recently mended; going pace, shoe became looser, neared turnpike gate came off. If Smith right senses would sensible something wrong pace, drunk notice. Beyond turnpike long piece road, upon fresh stones laid--large sharp stones, horse could driven quickly without risk danger. Over road, one shoe gone, I forced gallop utmost speed, rider meanwhile cutting whip, wild curses urging go still faster. Of course shoeless foot suffered dreadfully; hoof broken split quick, inside terribly cut sharpness stones. This could go on; horse could keep footing circumstances; pain great. I stumbled, fell violence knees. Smith flung fall, and, owing speed I going at, must fallen great force. I soon recovered feet limped side road, free stones. The moon risen hedge, light I could see Smith lying yards beyond me. He rise; made one slight effort so, heavy groan. I could groaned, too, I suffering intense pain foot knees; horses used bear pain silence. I uttered sound, I stood listened. One heavy groan Smith; though lay full moonlight I could see motion. I could nothing myself, but, oh! I listened sound horse, wheels, footsteps! The road much frequented, time night might stay hours help came us. I stood watching listening. It calm, sweet April night; sounds low notes nightingale, nothing moved white clouds near moon brown owl flitted hedge. It made think summer nights long ago, I used lie beside mother green pleasant meadow Farmer Grey's. 26 How Ended It must nearly midnight I heard great distance sound horse's feet. Sometimes sound died away, grew clearer nearer. The road Earlshall led woods belonged earl; sound came direction, I hoped might one coming search us. As sound came nearer nearer I almost sure I could distinguish Ginger's step; little nearer still, I could tell dog-cart. I neighed loudly, overjoyed hear answering neigh Ginger, men's voices. They came slowly stones, stopped dark figure lay upon ground. One men jumped out, stooped it. “It Reuben,” said, “and stir!” The man followed, bent him. “He dead,” said; “feel cold hands are.” They raised up, life, hair soaked blood. They laid again, came looked me. They soon saw cut knees. “Why, horse thrown him! Who would thought black horse would done that? Nobody thought could fall. Reuben must lying hours! Odd, too, horse moved place.” Robert attempted lead forward. I made step, almost fell again. “Halloo! bad foot well knees. Look here--his hoof cut pieces; might well come down, poor fellow! I tell what, Ned, I afraid right Reuben. Just think riding horse stones without shoe! Why, right senses would soon tried ride moon. I afraid old thing again. Poor Susan! looked awfully pale came house ask come home. She made believe bit anxious, talked lot things might kept him. But begged go meet him. But must do? There horse get home well body, easy matter.” Then followed conversation them, till agreed Robert, groom, lead me, Ned must take body. It hard job get dog-cart, one hold Ginger; knew well I going on, stood still stone. I noticed that, because, fault, impatient standing. Ned started slowly sad load, Robert came looked foot again; took handkerchief bound closely round, led home. I shall never forget night walk; three miles. Robert led slowly, I limped hobbled well I could great pain. I sure sorry me, often patted encouraged me, talking pleasant voice. At last I reached box, corn; Robert wrapped knees wet cloths, tied foot bran poultice, draw heat cleanse horse-doctor saw morning, I managed get straw, slept spite pain. The next day farrier examined wounds, said hoped joint injured; so, I spoiled work, I never lose blemish. I believe best make good cure, long painful one. Proud flesh, called it, came knees, burned caustic; last healed, put blistering fluid front knees bring hair off; reason this, I suppose right. As Smith's death sudden, one see it, inquest held. The landlord hostler White Lion, several people, gave evidence intoxicated started inn. The keeper toll-gate said rode hard gallop gate; shoe picked among stones, case quite plain them, I cleared blame. Everybody pitied Susan. She nearly mind; kept saying again, “Oh! good--so good! It cursed drink; sell cursed drink? Oh Reuben, Reuben!” So went till buried; then, home relations, she, six little children, obliged leave pleasant home tall oak-trees, go great gloomy Union House. 27 Ruined Going Downhill As soon knees sufficiently healed I turned small meadow month two; creature there; though I enjoyed liberty sweet grass, yet I long used society I felt lonely. Ginger I become fast friends, I missed company extremely. I often neighed I heard horses' feet passing road, I seldom got answer; till one morning gate opened, come dear old Ginger. The man slipped halter, left there. With joyful whinny I trotted her; glad meet, I soon found pleasure brought me. Her story would long tell, end ruined hard riding, turned see rest would do. Lord George young would take warning; hard rider, would hunt whenever could get chance, quite careless horse. Soon I left stable steeplechase, determined ride. Though groom told little strained, fit race, believe it, day race urged Ginger keep foremost riders. With high spirit, strained utmost; came first three horses, wind touched, besides heavy her, back strained. “And so,” said, “here are, ruined prime youth strength, drunkard, I fool; hard.” We felt been. However, spoil pleasure other's company; gallop did, used feed, lie together, stand hours one shady lime-trees heads close other; passed time till family returned town. One day saw earl come meadow, York him. Seeing was, stood still lime-tree, let come us. They examined us carefully. The earl seemed much annoyed. “There three hundred pounds flung away earthly use,” said he; “but I care horses old friend, thought would find good home me, ruined. The mare shall twelve-month's run, shall see her; black one, must sold; great pity, I could knees like stables.” “No, lord, course not,” said York; “but might get place appearance much consequence, still well treated. I know man Bath, master livery stables, often wants good horse low figure; I know looks well horses. The inquest cleared horse's character, lordship's recommendation, mine, would sufficient warrant him.” “You better write him, York. I particular place money would fetch.” After left us. “They soon take away,” said Ginger, “and I shall lose friend I have, likely shall never see again. It Is hard world!” About week Robert came field halter, slipped head, led away. There leave-taking Ginger; neighed I led off, trotted anxiously along hedge, calling long could hear sound feet. Through recommendation York, I bought master livery stables. I go train, new me, required good deal courage first time; I found puffing, rushing, whistling, and, all, trembling horse-box I stood real harm, I soon took quietly. When I reached end journey I found tolerably comfortable stable, well attended to. These stables airy pleasant I used to. The stalls laid slope instead level, head kept tied manger, I obliged always stand slope, fatiguing. Men seem know yet horses work stand comfortably turn about; however, I well fed well cleaned, and, whole, I think master took much care us could. He kept good many horses carriages different kinds hire. Sometimes men drove them; others, horse chaise let gentlemen ladies drove themselves. 28 A Job Horse His Drivers Hitherto I always driven people least knew drive; place I get experience different kinds bad ignorant driving horses subjected; I “job horse”, let sorts people wished hire me; I good-tempered gentle, I think I oftener let ignorant drivers horses, I could depended upon. It would take long time tell different styles I driven, I mention them. First, tight-rein drivers--men seemed think depended holding reins hard could, never relaxing pull horse's mouth, giving least liberty movement. They always talking “keeping horse well hand”, “holding horse up”, horse made hold up. Some poor, broken-down horses, whose mouths made hard insensible drivers these, may, perhaps, find support it; horse depend upon legs, tender mouth easily guided, tormenting, stupid. Then loose-rein drivers, let reins lie easily backs, hand rest lazily knees. Of course, gentlemen control horse, anything happens suddenly. If horse shies, starts, stumbles, nowhere, cannot help horse till mischief done. Of course, I objection it, I habit either starting stumbling, used depend driver guidance encouragement. Still, one likes feel rein little going downhill, likes know one's driver gone sleep. Besides, slovenly way driving gets horse bad often lazy habits, changes hands whipped less pain trouble. Squire Gordon always kept us best paces best manners. He said spoiling horse letting get bad habits cruel spoiling child, suffer afterward. Besides, drivers often careless altogether, attend anything else horses. I went phaeton one day one them; lady two children behind. He flopped reins started, course gave several unmeaning cuts whip, though I fairly off. There good deal road-mending going on, even stones freshly laid great many loose ones about. My driver laughing joking lady children, talking country right left; never thought worth keep eye horse drive smoothest parts road; easily happened I got stone one fore feet. Now, Mr. Gordon John, fact good driver, there, would seen something wrong I gone three paces. Or even dark practiced hand would felt rein something wrong step, would got picked stone. But man went laughing talking, every step stone became firmly wedged shoe frog foot. The stone sharp inside round outside, which, every one knows, dangerous kind horse pick up, time cutting foot making liable stumble fall. Whether man partly blind careless I cannot say, drove stone foot good half-mile saw anything. By time I going lame pain last saw it, called out, “Well, go! Why, sent us lame horse! What shame!” He chucked reins flipped whip, saying, “Now, then, use playing old soldier me; journey go, use turning lame lazy.” Just time farmer came riding brown cob. He lifted hat pulled up. “I beg pardon, sir,” said, “but I think something matter horse; goes much stone shoe. If allow I look feet; loose scattered stones confounded dangerous things horses.” “He hired horse,” said driver. “I know matter him, great shame send lame beast like this.” The farmer dismounted, slipping rein arm took near foot. “Bless me, stone! Lame! I think so!” At first tried dislodge hand, tightly wedged drew stone-pick pocket, carefully trouble got out. Then holding said, “There, stone horse picked up. It wonder fall break knees bargain!” “Well, sure!” said driver; “that queer thing! I never knew horses picked stones before.” “Did you?” said farmer rather contemptuously; “but do, though, best it, cannot help sometimes roads these. And want lame horse must look sharp get quickly. This foot much bruised,” said, setting gently patting me. “If I might advise, sir, better drive gently awhile; foot good deal hurt, lameness go directly.” Then mounting cob raising hat lady trotted off. When gone driver began flop reins whip harness, I understood I go on, course I did, glad stone gone, still good deal pain. This sort experience job horses often came for. 29 Cockneys Then steam-engine style driving; drivers mostly people towns, never horse generally traveled rail. They always seemed think horse something like steam-engine, smaller. At rate, think pay horse bound go far fast heavy load please. And roads heavy muddy, dry good; stony smooth, uphill downhill, same--on, on, on, one must go, pace, relief consideration. These people never think getting walk steep hill. Oh, no, paid ride, ride will! The horse? Oh, used it! What horses made for, drag people uphill? Walk! A good joke indeed! And whip plied rein chucked often rough, scolding voice cries out, “Go along, lazy beast!” And another slash whip, time best get along, uncomplaining obedient, though often sorely harassed down-hearted. This steam-engine style driving wears us faster kind. I would far rather go twenty miles good considerate driver I would go ten these; would take less me. Another thing, scarcely ever put brake, however steep downhill may be, thus bad accidents sometimes happen; put on, often forget take bottom hill, I pull halfway next hill, one wheels held brake, driver chose think it; terrible strain horse. Then cockneys, instead starting easy pace, gentleman would do, generally set full speed stable-yard; want stop, first whip us, pull suddenly nearly thrown haunches, mouths jagged bit--they call pulling dash; turn corner sharply right side wrong side road. I well remember one spring evening I Rory day. (Rory horse mostly went pair ordered, good honest fellow was.) We driver, always considerate gentle us, pleasant day. We coming home good smart pace, twilight. Our road turned sharp left; close hedge side, plenty room pass, driver pull us in. As neared corner I heard horse two wheels coming rapidly hill toward us. The hedge high, I could see nothing, next moment upon other. Happily me, I side next hedge. Rory left side pole, even shaft protect him. The man driving making straight corner, came sight us time pull side. The whole shock came upon Rory. The gig shaft ran right chest, making stagger back cry I shall never forget. The horse thrown upon haunches one shaft broken. It turned horse stables, high-wheeled gig young men fond of. The driver one random, ignorant fellows, even know side road, or, know, care. And poor Rory flesh torn open bleeding, blood streaming down. They said little one side would killed him; good thing him, poor fellow, had. As was, long time wound healed, sold coal-carting; is, steep hills, horses know. Some sights I saw there, horse come downhill heavily loaded two-wheel cart behind him, brake could placed, make sad even think of. After Rory disabled I often went carriage mare named Peggy, stood next stall mine. She strong, well-made animal, bright dun color, beautifully dappled, dark-brown mane tail. There high breeding her, pretty remarkably sweet-tempered willing. Still, anxious look eye, I knew trouble. The first time went together I thought odd pace; seemed go partly trot, partly canter, three four paces, little jump forward. It unpleasant horse pulled her, made quite fidgety. When got home I asked made go odd, awkward way. “Ah,” said troubled manner, “I know paces bad, I do? It really fault; legs short. I stand nearly high you, legs good three inches longer knee mine, course take much longer step go much faster. You see I make myself. I wish I could done so; I would long legs then. All troubles come short legs,” said Peggy, desponding tone. “But it,” I said, “when strong good-tempered willing?” “Why, see,” said she, “men go fast, one cannot keep horses nothing whip, whip, whip, time. And I keep I could, got ugly shuffling pace. It always so; I lived first master I always went good regular trot, hurry. He young clergyman country, good, kind master was. He two churches good way apart, great deal work, never scolded whipped going faster. He fond me. I wish I now; leave go large town, I sold farmer. “Some farmers, know, capital masters; I think one low sort man. He cared nothing good horses good driving; cared going fast. I went fast I could, would do, always whipping; I got way making spring forward keep up. On market nights used stay late inn, drive home gallop. “One dark night galloping home usual, sudden wheel came great heavy thing road, turned gig minute. He thrown arm broken, ribs, I think. At rate, end living him, I sorry. But see everywhere me, men must go fast. I wish legs longer!” Poor Peggy! I sorry her, I could comfort her, I knew hard upon slow-paced horses put fast ones; whipping comes share, cannot help it. She often used phaeton, much liked ladies, gentle; time sold two ladies drove themselves, wanted safe, good horse. I met several times country, going good steady pace, looking gay contented horse could be. I glad see her, deserved good place. After left us another horse came stead. He young, bad name shying starting, lost good place. I asked made shy. “Well, I hardly know,” said. “I timid I young, good deal frightened several times, I saw anything strange I used turn look it--you see, blinkers one cannot see understand thing unless one looks round--and master always gave whipping, course made start on, make less afraid. I think would let look things quietly, see nothing hurt me, would right, I got used them. One day old gentleman riding him, large piece white paper rag blew across one side me. I shied started forward. My master usual whipped smartly, old man cried out, 'You wrong! wrong! You never whip horse shying; shies frightened, frighten make habit worse.' So I suppose men so. I sure I want shy sake it; one know dangerous not, one never allowed get used anything? I never afraid I know. Now I brought park deer; course I knew well I sheep cow, common, I know many sensible horses frightened them, kick quite shindy pass paddock deer.” I knew companion said true, I wished every young horse good masters Farmer Grey Squire Gordon. Of course sometimes came good driving here. I remember one morning I put light gig, taken house Pulteney Street. Two gentlemen came out; taller came round head; looked bit bridle, shifted collar hand, see fitted comfortably. “Do consider horse wants curb?” said hostler. “Well,” said man, “I say would go well without; uncommon good mouth, though fine spirit vice; generally find people like curb.” “I like it,” said gentleman; “be good take off, put rein cheek. An easy mouth great thing long journey, not, old fellow?” said, patting neck. Then took reins, got up. I remember quietly turned round, light feel rein, drawing whip gently across back, off. I arched neck set best pace. I found I one behind knew good horse ought driven. It seemed like old times again, made feel quite gay. This gentleman took great liking me, trying several times saddle prevailed upon master sell friend his, wanted safe, pleasant horse riding. And came pass summer I sold Mr. Barry. 30 A Thief My new master unmarried man. He lived Bath, much engaged business. His doctor advised take horse exercise, purpose bought me. He hired stable short distance lodgings, engaged man named Filcher groom. My master knew little horses, treated well, I good easy place circumstances ignorant. He ordered best hay plenty oats, crushed beans, bran, vetches, rye grass, man might think needful. I heard master give order, I knew plenty good food, I thought I well off. For days went well. I found groom understood business. He kept stable clean airy, groomed thoroughly; never otherwise gentle. He hostler one great hotels Bath. He given up, cultivated fruit vegetables market, wife bred fattened poultry rabbits sale. After awhile seemed oats came short; I beans, bran mixed instead oats, few; certainly quarter been. In two three weeks began tell upon strength spirits. The grass food, though good, thing keep condition without corn. However, I could complain, make known wants. So went two months; I wondered master see something matter. However, one afternoon rode country see friend his, gentleman farmer, lived road Wells. This gentleman quick eye horses; welcomed friend said, casting eye me: “It seems me, Barry, horse look well first him; well?” “Yes, I believe so,” said master; “but nearly lively was; groom tells horses always dull weak autumn, I must expect it.” “Autumn, fiddlesticks!” said farmer. “Why, August; light work good food ought go like this, even autumn. How feed him?” My master told him. The shook head slowly, began feel over. “I cannot say eats corn, dear fellow, I much mistaken horse gets it. Have ridden fast?” “No, gently.” “Then put hand here,” said he, passing hand neck shoulder; “he warm damp horse come grass. I advise look stable little more. I hate suspicious, and, thank heaven, I be, I trust men, present absent; mean scoundrels, wicked enough rob dumb beast food. You must look it.” And turning man, come take me, “Give horse right good feed bruised oats, stint him.” “Dumb beasts!” Yes, are; I could spoken I could told master oats went to. My groom used come every morning six clock, little boy, always covered basket him. He used go father harness-room, corn kept, I could see them, door stood ajar, fill little bag oats bin, used off. Five six mornings this, boy left stable, door pushed open, policeman walked in, holding child tight arm; another policeman followed, locked door inside, saying, “Show place father keeps rabbits' food.” The boy looked frightened began cry; escape, led way corn-bin. Here policeman found another empty bag like found full oats boy's basket. Filcher cleaning feet time, soon saw him, though blustered good deal walked “lock-up”, boy him. I heard afterward boy held guilty, man sentenced prison two months. 31 A Humbug My master immediately suited, days new groom came. He tall, good-looking fellow enough; ever humbug shape groom Alfred Smirk man. He civil me, never used ill; fact, great deal stroking patting master see it. He always brushed mane tail water hoofs oil brought door, make look smart; cleaning feet looking shoes, grooming thoroughly, thought I cow. He left bit rusty, saddle damp, crupper stiff. Alfred Smirk considered handsome; spent great deal time hair, whiskers necktie, little looking-glass harness-room. When master speaking always, “Yes, sir; yes, sir”--touching hat every word; every one thought nice young man Mr. Barry fortunate meet him. I say laziest, conceited fellow I ever came near. Of course, great thing ill-used, horse wants that. I loose box, might comfortable indolent clean out. He never took straw away, smell lay underneath bad; strong vapors rose made eyes smart inflame, I feel appetite food. One day master came said, “Alfred, stable smells rather strong; give stall good scrub throw plenty water?” “Well, sir,” said, touching cap, “I please, sir; rather dangerous, sir, throwing water horse's box; apt take cold, sir. I like injury, I please, sir.” “Well,” said master, “I like take cold; I like smell stable. Do think drains right?” “Well, sir, mention it, I think drain sometimes send back smell; may something wrong, sir.” “Then send bricklayer seen to,” said master. “Yes, sir, I will.” The bricklayer came pulled great many bricks, found nothing amiss; put lime charged master five shillings, smell box bad ever. But all: standing I quantity moist straw feet grew unhealthy tender, master used say: “I know matter horse; goes fumble-footed. I sometimes afraid stumble.” “Yes, sir,” said Alfred, “I noticed myself, I exercised him.” Now fact hardly ever exercise me, master busy I often stood days together without stretching legs all, yet fed high I hard work. This often disordered health, made sometimes heavy dull, often restless feverish. He never even gave meal green food bran mash, would cooled me, altogether ignorant conceited; then, instead exercise change food, I take horse balls draughts; which, beside nuisance poured throat, used make feel ill uncomfortable. One day feet tender that, trotting fresh stones master back, I made two serious stumbles that, came Lansdown city, stopped farrier's, asked see matter me. The man took feet one one examined them; standing dusting hands one other, said: “Your horse got 'thrush', badly, too; feet tender; fortunate down. I wonder groom seen before. This sort thing find foul stables, litter never properly cleaned out. If send to-morrow I attend hoof, I direct man apply liniment I give him.” The next day I feet thoroughly cleansed stuffed tow soaked strong lotion; unpleasant business was. The farrier ordered litter taken box day day, floor kept clean. Then I bran mashes, little green food, much corn, till feet well again. With treatment I soon regained spirits; Mr. Barry much disgusted twice deceived grooms determined give keeping horse, hire wanted one. I therefore kept till feet quite sound, sold again. Part III 32 A Horse Fair No doubt horse fair amusing place nothing lose; rate, plenty see. Long strings young horses country, fresh marshes; droves shaggy little Welsh ponies, higher Merrylegs; hundreds cart horses sorts, long tails braided tied scarlet cord; good many like myself, handsome high-bred, fallen middle class, accident blemish, unsoundness wind, complaint. There splendid animals quite prime, fit anything; throwing legs showing paces high style, trotted leading rein, groom running side. But round background number poor things, sadly broken hard work, knees knuckling hind legs swinging every step, dejected-looking old horses, lip hanging ears lying back heavily, pleasure life, hope; thin might see ribs, old sores backs hips. These sad sights horse look upon, knows may come state. There great deal bargaining, running beating down; horse may speak mind far understands, I say lies told trickery horse fair clever man could give account of. I put two three strong, useful-looking horses, good many people came look us. The gentlemen always turned saw broken knees; though man swore slip stall. The first thing pull mouth open, look eyes, feel way legs, give hard feel skin flesh, try paces. It wonderful difference way things done. Some rough, offhand way, one piece wood; others would take hands gently one's body, pat then, much say, “By leave.” Of course I judged good deal buyers manners myself. There one man, I thought, would buy me, I happy. He gentleman, yet one loud, flashy sort call so. He rather small man, well made, quick motions. I knew moment way handled me, used horses; spoke gently, gray eye kindly, cheery look it. It may seem strange say--but true same--that clean, fresh smell made take him; smell old beer tobacco, I hated, fresh smell come hayloft. He offered twenty-three pounds me, refused, walked away. I looked him, gone, hard-looking, loud-voiced man came. I dreadfully afraid would me; walked off. One two came mean business. Then hard-faced man came back offered twenty-three pounds. A close bargain driven, salesman began think get asked, must come down; gray-eyed man came back again. I could help reaching head toward him. He stroked face kindly. “Well, old chap,” said, “I think suit other. I give twenty-four him.” “Say twenty-five shall him.” “Twenty-four ten,” said friend, decided tone, “and another sixpence--yes no?” “Done,” said salesman; “and may depend upon monstrous deal quality horse, want cab work bargain.” The money paid spot, new master took halter, led fair inn, saddle bridle ready. He gave good feed oats stood I ate it, talking talking me. Half hour way London, pleasant lanes country roads, came great London thoroughfare, traveled steadily, till twilight reached great city. The gas lamps already lighted; streets right, streets left, streets crossing other, mile upon mile. I thought never come end them. At last, passing one, came long cab stand, rider called cheery voice, “Good-night, governor!” “Halloo!” cried voice. “Have got good one?” “I think so,” replied owner. “I wish luck him.” “Thank you, governor,” rode on. We soon turned one side streets, halfway turned narrow street, rather poor-looking houses one side, seemed coach-houses stables other. My owner pulled one houses whistled. The door flew open, young woman, followed little girl boy, ran out. There lively greeting rider dismounted. “Now, then, Harry, boy, open gates, mother bring us lantern.” The next minute standing round small stable-yard. “Is gentle, father?” “Yes, Dolly, gentle kitten; come pat him.” At little hand patting shoulder without fear. How good felt! “Let get bran mash rub down,” said mother. “Do, Polly, wants; I know got beautiful mash ready me.” “Sausage dumpling apple turnover!” shouted boy, set laughing. I led comfortable, clean-smelling stall, plenty dry straw, capital supper I lay down, thinking I going happy. 33 A London Cab Horse Jeremiah Barker new master's name, every one called Jerry, I shall same. Polly, wife, good match man could have. She plump, trim, tidy little woman, smooth, dark hair, dark eyes, merry little mouth. The boy twelve years old, tall, frank, good-tempered lad; little Dorothy (Dolly called her) mother again, eight years old. They wonderfully fond other; I never knew happy, merry family since. Jerry cab own, two horses, drove attended himself. His horse tall, white, rather large-boned animal called “Captain”. He old now, young must splendid; still proud way holding head arching neck; fact, high-bred, fine-mannered, noble old horse, every inch him. He told early youth went Crimean War; belonged officer cavalry, used lead regiment. I tell hereafter. The next morning, I well-groomed, Polly Dolly came yard see make friends. Harry helping father since early morning, stated opinion I turn “regular brick”. Polly brought slice apple, Dolly piece bread, made much I “Black Beauty” olden time. It great treat petted talked gentle voice, I let see well I could I wished friendly. Polly thought I handsome, great deal good cab, broken knees. “Of course one tell us whose fault was,” said Jerry, “and long I know I shall give benefit doubt; firmer, neater stepper I never rode. We call 'Jack', old one--shall we, Polly?” “Do,” said, “for I like keep good name going.” Captain went cab morning. Harry came school feed give water. In afternoon I put cab. Jerry took much pains see collar bridle fitted comfortably John Manly again. When crupper let hole two fitted well. There check-rein, curb, nothing plain ring snaffle. What blessing was! After driving side street came large cab stand Jerry said “Good-night”. On one side wide street high houses wonderful shop fronts, old church churchyard, surrounded iron palisades. Alongside iron rails number cabs drawn up, waiting passengers; bits hay lying ground; men standing together talking; sitting boxes reading newspaper; one two feeding horses bits hay, giving drink water. We pulled rank back last cab. Two three men came round began look pass remarks. “Very good funeral,” said one. “Too smart-looking,” said another, shaking head wise way; “you find something wrong one fine mornings, name Jones.” “Well,” said Jerry pleasantly, “I suppose I need find till finds out, eh? And so, I keep spirits little longer.” Then came broad-faced man, dressed great gray coat great gray cape great white buttons, gray hat, blue comforter loosely tied round neck; hair gray, too; jolly-looking fellow, men made way him. He looked over, going buy me; straightening grunt, said, “He right sort you, Jerry; I care gave him, worth it.” Thus character established stand. This man's name Grant, called “Gray Grant”, “Governor Grant”. He longest stand men, took upon settle matters stop disputes. He generally good-humored, sensible man; temper little out, sometimes drunk much, nobody liked come near fist, could deal heavy blow. The first week life cab horse trying. I never used London, noise, hurry, crowds horses, carts, carriages I make way made feel anxious harassed; I soon found I could perfectly trust driver, I made easy got used it. Jerry good driver I ever known, better, took much thought horses himself. He soon found I willing work best, never laid whip unless gently drawing end back I go on; generally I knew quite well way took reins, I believe whip frequently stuck side hand. In short time I master understood well horse man do. In stable, too, could comfort. The stalls old-fashioned style, much slope; two movable bars fixed across back stalls, night, resting, took halters put bars, thus could turn stand whichever way pleased, great comfort. Jerry kept us clean, gave us much change food could, always plenty it; that, always gave us plenty clean fresh water, allowed stand us night day, except course came warm. Some people say horse ought drink likes; I know allowed drink want drink little time, us great deal good swallowing half bucketful time, left without till thirsty miserable. Some grooms go home beer leave us hours dry hay oats nothing moisten them; course gulp much once, helps spoil breathing sometimes chills stomachs. But best thing Sundays rest; worked hard week I think could kept day; besides, time enjoy other's company. It days I learned companion's history. 34 An Old War Horse Captain broken trained army horse; first owner officer cavalry going Crimean war. He said quite enjoyed training horses, trotting together, turning together, right hand left, halting word command, dashing forward full speed sound trumpet signal officer. He was, young, dark, dappled iron-gray, considered handsome. His master, young, high-spirited gentleman, fond him, treated first greatest care kindness. He told thought life army horse pleasant; came sent abroad sea great ship, almost changed mind. “That part it,” said he, “was dreadful! Of course could walk land ship; obliged put strong straps bodies, lifted legs spite struggles, swung air water, deck great vessel. There placed small close stalls, never long time saw sky, able stretch legs. The ship sometimes rolled high winds, knocked about, felt bad enough. “However, last came end, hauled up, swung land; glad, snorted neighed joy, felt firm ground feet. “We soon found country come different many hardships endure besides fighting; many men fond horses everything could make comfortable spite snow, wet, things order.” “But fighting?” said I, “was worse anything else?” “Well,” said he, “I hardly know; always liked hear trumpet sound, called out, impatient start off, though sometimes stand hours, waiting word command; word given used spring forward gayly eagerly cannon balls, bayonets, bullets. I believe long felt rider firm saddle, hand steady bridle, one us gave way fear, even terrible bomb-shells whirled air burst thousand pieces. “I, noble master, went many actions together without wound; though I saw horses shot bullets, pierced lances, gashed fearful saber-cuts; though left dead field, dying agony wounds, I think I feared myself. My master's cheery voice, encouraged men, made feel I could killed. I perfect trust guiding I ready charge cannon's mouth. I saw many brave men cut down, many fall mortally wounded saddles. I heard cries groans dying, I cantered ground slippery blood, frequently turn aside avoid trampling wounded man horse, but, one dreadful day, I never felt terror; day I shall never forget.” Here old Captain paused awhile drew long breath; I waited, went on. “It one autumn morning, usual, hour daybreak cavalry turned out, ready caparisoned day's work, whether might fighting waiting. The men stood horses waiting, ready orders. As light increased seemed excitement among officers; day well begun heard firing enemy's guns. “Then one officers rode gave word men mount, second every man saddle, every horse stood expecting touch rein, pressure rider's heels, animated, eager; still trained well that, except champing bits, restive tossing heads time time, could said stirred. “My dear master I head line, sat motionless watchful, took little stray lock mane turned wrong side, laid right, smoothed hand; patting neck, said, 'We shall day to-day, Bayard, beauty; duty done.' He stroked neck morning more, I think, ever done before; quietly on, thinking something else. I loved feel hand neck, arched crest proudly happily; I stood still, I knew moods, liked quiet, gay. “I cannot tell happened day, I tell last charge made together; across valley right front enemy's cannon. By time well used roar heavy guns, rattle musket fire, flying shot near us; never I fire rode day. From right, left, front, shot poured upon us. Many brave man went down, many horse fell, flinging rider earth; many horse without rider ran wildly ranks; terrified alone, hand guide him, came pressing among old companions, gallop charge. “Fearful was, one stopped, one turned back. Every moment ranks thinned, comrades fell, closed keep together; instead shaken staggered pace gallop became faster faster neared cannon. “My master, dear master cheering comrades right arm raised high, one balls whizzing close head struck him. I felt stagger shock, though uttered cry; I tried check speed, sword dropped right hand, rein fell loose left, sinking backward saddle fell earth; riders swept past us, force charge I driven spot. “I wanted keep place side leave rush horses' feet, vain; without master friend I alone great slaughter ground; fear took hold me, I trembled I never trembled before; I too, I seen horses do, tried join ranks gallop them; I beaten swords soldiers. Just soldier whose horse killed caught bridle mounted me, new master I going forward; gallant company cruelly overpowered, remained alive fierce fight guns came galloping back ground. Some horses badly wounded could scarcely move loss blood; noble creatures trying three legs drag along, others struggling rise fore feet, hind legs shattered shot. After battle wounded men brought dead buried.” “And wounded horses?” I said; “were left die?” “No, army farriers went field pistols shot ruined; slight wounds brought back attended to, greater part noble, willing creatures went morning never came back! In stables one four returned. “I never saw dear master again. I believe fell dead saddle. I never loved master well. I went many engagements, wounded, seriously; war I came back England, sound strong I went out.” I said, “I heard people talk war fine thing.” “Ah!” said he, “I think never saw it. No doubt fine enemy, exercise parade sham fight. Yes, fine then; thousands good brave men horses killed crippled life, different look.” “Do know fought about?” said I. “No,” said, “that horse understand, enemy must awfully wicked people, right go way sea purpose kill them.” 35 Jerry Barker I never knew better man new master. He kind good, strong right John Manly; good-tempered merry people could pick quarrel him. He fond making little songs, singing himself. One fond this: “Come, father mother, And sister brother, Come, you, turn And help one another.” And did; Harry clever stable-work much older boy, always wanted could. Then Polly Dolly used come morning help cab--to brush beat cushions, rub glass, Jerry giving us cleaning yard, Harry rubbing harness. There used great deal laughing fun them, put Captain much better spirits heard scolding hard words. They always early morning, Jerry would say: “If morning Throw minutes away, You cannot pick In course day. You may hurry scurry, And flurry worry, You lost forever, Forever aye.” He could bear careless loitering waste time; nothing near making angry find people, always late, wanting cab horse driven hard, make idleness. One day two wild-looking young men came tavern close stand, called Jerry. “Here, cabby! look sharp, rather late; put steam, you, take us Victoria time one clock train? You shall shilling extra.” “I take regular pace, gentlemen; shillings pay putting steam like that.” Larry's cab standing next ours; flung open door, said, “I man, gentlemen! take cab, horse get right;” shut in, wink toward Jerry, said, “It conscience go beyond jog-trot.” Then slashing jaded horse, set hard could. Jerry patted neck: “No, Jack, shilling would pay sort thing, would it, old boy?” Although Jerry determinedly set hard driving, please careless people, always went good fair pace, putting steam, said, knew why. I well remember one morning, stand waiting fare, young man, carrying heavy portmanteau, trod piece orange peel lay pavement, fell great force. Jerry first run lift up. He seemed much stunned, led shop walked great pain. Jerry course came back stand, ten minutes one shopmen called him, drew pavement. “Can take South-Eastern Railway?” said young man; “this unlucky fall made late, I fear; great importance I lose twelve clock train. I thankful could get time, gladly pay extra fare.” “I best,” said Jerry heartily, “if think well enough, sir,” looked dreadfully white ill. “I must go,” said earnestly, “please open door, let us lose time.” The next minute Jerry box; cheery chirrup me, twitch rein I well understood. “Now then, Jack, boy,” said he, “spin along, show get ground, know why.” It always difficult drive fast city middle day, streets full traffic, could done; good driver good horse, understand other, one mind, wonderful do. I good mouth--that I could guided slightest touch rein; great thing London, among carriages, omnibuses, carts, vans, trucks, cabs, great wagons creeping along walking pace; going one way, another, going slowly, others wanting pass them; omnibuses stopping short every minutes take passenger, obliging horse coming behind pull too, pass, get them; perhaps try pass, something else comes dashing narrow opening, keep behind omnibus again; presently think see chance, manage get front, going near wheels side half inch nearer would scrape. Well, get along bit, soon find long train carts carriages obliged go walk; perhaps come regular block-up, stand still minutes together, till something clears side street, policeman interferes; ready chance--to dash forward opening, quick rat-dog see room time, lest get wheels locked smashed, shaft vehicle run chest shoulder. All ready for. If want get London fast middle day wants deal practice. Jerry I used it, one could beat us getting set upon it. I quick bold could always trust driver; Jerry quick patient time, could trust horse, great thing too. He seldom used whip; I knew voice, click, click, wanted get fast, rein I go; need whipping; I must go back story. The streets full day, got pretty well far bottom Cheapside, block three four minutes. The young man put head said anxiously, “I think I better get walk; I shall never get goes on.” “I done, sir,” said Jerry; “I think shall time. This block-up cannot last much longer, luggage heavy carry, sir.” Just cart front us began move on, good turn. In out, went, fast horseflesh could it, wonder good clear time London Bridge, whole train cabs carriages going way quick trot, perhaps wanting catch train. At rate, whirled station many more, great clock pointed eight minutes twelve clock. “Thank God! time,” said young man, “and thank you, too, friend, good horse. You saved money ever pay for. Take extra half-crown.” “No, sir, no, thank same; glad hit time, sir; stay now, sir, bell ringing. Here, porter! take gentleman's luggage--Dover line twelve clock train--that it,” without waiting another word Jerry wheeled round make room cabs dashing last minute, drew one side till crush past. “'So glad!' said, 'so glad!' Poor young fellow! I wonder made anxious!” Jerry often talked quite loud enough hear moving. On Jerry's return rank good deal laughing chaffing driving hard train extra fare, said, principles, wanted know much pocketed. “A good deal I generally get,” said he, nodding slyly; “what gave keep little comforts several days.” “Gammon!” said one. “He humbug,” said another; “preaching us himself.” “Look here, mates,” said Jerry; “the gentleman offered half crown extra, I take it; quite pay enough see glad catch train; Jack I choose quick run please ourselves, business yours.” “Well,” said Larry, “you never rich man.” “Most likely not,” said Jerry; “but I know I shall less happy that. I heard commandments read great many times I never noticed said, 'Thou shalt rich'; good many curious things said New Testament rich men I think would make feel rather queer I one them.” “If ever get rich,” said Governor Gray, looking shoulder across top cab, “you deserve it, Jerry, find curse come wealth. As you, Larry, die poor; spend much whipcord.” “Well,” said Larry, “what fellow horse go without it?” “You never take trouble see go without it; whip always going St. Vitus' dance arm, wear wears horse out; know always changing horses; why? Because never give peace encouragement.” “Well, I good luck,” said Larry, “that is.” “And never will,” said governor. “Good Luck rather particular rides with, mostly prefers got common sense good heart; least experience.” Governor Gray turned round newspaper, men went cabs. 36 The Sunday Cab One morning, Jerry put shafts fastening traces, gentleman walked yard. “Your servant, sir,” said Jerry. “Good-morning, Mr. Barker,” said gentleman. “I glad make arrangements taking Mrs. Briggs regularly church Sunday mornings. We go New Church now, rather walk.” “Thank you, sir,” said Jerry, “but I taken six-days' license,* therefore I could take fare Sunday; would legal.” * A years since annual charge cab license much reduced, difference six seven days' cabs abolished. “Oh!” said other, “I know six-days' cab; course would easy alter license. I would see lose it; fact is, Mrs. Briggs much prefers drive her.” “I glad oblige lady, sir, I seven-days' license once, work hard me, hard horses. Year year out, day's rest, never Sunday wife children; never able go place worship, I always used I took driving box. So last five years I taken six-days' license, I find better way round.” “Well, course,” replied Mr. Briggs, “it proper every person rest, able go church Sundays, I thought would minded short distance horse, day; would afternoon evening yourself, good customers, know.” “Yes, sir, true, I grateful favors, I sure; anything I could oblige you, lady, I proud happy do; I cannot give Sundays, sir, indeed I cannot. I read God made man, made horses beasts, soon He made He made day rest, bade rest one day seven; I think, sir, He must known good them, I sure good me; I stronger healthier altogether, I day rest; horses fresh too, wear nearly fast. The six-day drivers tell same, I laid money savings bank ever I before; wife children, sir, why, heart alive! would go back seven days could see.” “Oh, well,” said gentleman. “Do trouble yourself, Mr. Barker, further. I inquire somewhere else,” walked away. “Well,” says Jerry me, “we cannot help it, Jack, old boy; must Sundays.” “Polly!” shouted, “Polly! come here.” She minute. “What about, Jerry?” “Why, dear, Mr. Briggs wants take Mrs. Briggs church every Sunday morning. I say I six-days' license. He says, 'Get seven-days' license, I make worth while;' know, Polly, good customers us. Mrs. Briggs often goes shopping hours, making calls, pays fair honorable like lady; beating making three hours two hours half, folks do; easy work horses; like tearing along catch trains people always quarter hour late; I oblige matter likely shall lose altogether. What say, little woman?” “I say, Jerry,” says she, speaking slowly, “I say, Mrs. Briggs would give sovereign every Sunday morning, I would seven-days' cabman again. We known Sundays, know call own. Thank God, earn enough keep us, though sometimes close work pay oats hay, license, rent besides; Harry soon earning something, I would rather struggle harder go back horrid times hardly minute look children, never could go place worship together, happy, quiet day. God forbid ever turn back times; I say, Jerry.” “And I told Mr. Briggs, dear,” said Jerry, “and I mean stick to. So go fret yourself, Polly” (for begun cry); “I would go back old times I earned twice much, settled, little woman. Now, cheer up, I stand.” Three weeks passed away conversation, order come Mrs. Briggs; nothing taking jobs stand. Jerry took heart good deal, course work harder horse man. But Polly would always cheer up, say, “Never mind, father, never, mind. “'Do best, And leave rest, 'Twill come right Some day night.'” It soon became known Jerry lost best customer, reason. Most men said fool, two three took part. “If workingmen stick Sunday,” said Truman, “they soon none left; every man's right every beast's right. By God's law day rest, law England day rest; I say ought hold rights laws give us keep children.” “All well religious chaps talk so,” said Larry; “but I turn shilling I can. I believe religion, I see religious people better rest.” “If better,” put Jerry, “it religious. You might well say country's laws good people break them. If man gives way temper, speaks evil neighbor, pay debts, religious, I care much goes church. If men shams humbugs, make religion untrue. Real religion best truest thing world, thing make man really happy make world live better.” “If religion good anything,” said Jones, “it would prevent religious people making us work Sundays, know many do, I say religion nothing sham; why, church chapel-goers would hardly worth coming Sunday. But privileges, call them, I go without. I shall expect answer soul, I cannot get chance saving it.” Several men applauded this, till Jerry said: “That may sound well enough, do; every man must look soul; cannot lay another man's door like foundling expect take care it; see, always sitting box waiting fare, say, 'If take one else will, look Sunday.' Of course, go bottom it, would see never came cab would use standing there; people always like go bottom things; may convenient it; Sunday drivers would strike day rest thing would done.” “And would good people could get favorite preachers?” said Larry. “It Is lay plans people,” said Jerry, “but cannot walk far go nearer; rain put mackintoshes week-day. If thing right done, wrong done without; good man find way. And true us cabmen church-goers.” 37 The Golden Rule Two three weeks this, came yard rather late evening, Polly came running across road lantern (she always brought wet). “It come right, Jerry; Mrs. Briggs sent servant afternoon ask take to-morrow eleven clock. I said, 'Yes, I thought so, supposed employed one else now.'” “'Well,' said he, 'the real fact is, master put Mr. Barker refused come Sundays, trying cabs, something wrong all; drive fast, slow, mistress says one nice clean yours, nothing suit Mr. Barker's cab again.'” Polly almost breath, Jerry broke merry laugh. “''Twill come right day night': right, dear; generally are. Run get supper, I Jack's harness make snug happy time.” After Mrs. Briggs wanted Jerry's cab quite often before, never, however, Sunday; came day Sunday work, happened. We come home Saturday night tired, glad think next day would rest, be. On Sunday morning Jerry cleaning yard, Polly stepped him, looking full something. “What it?” said Jerry. “Well, dear,” said, “poor Dinah Brown letter brought say mother dangerously ill, must go directly wishes see alive. The place ten miles away here, country, says takes train still four miles walk; weak is, baby four weeks old, course would impossible; wants know would take cab, promises pay faithfully, get money.” “Tut, tut! see that. It money I thinking about, losing Sunday; horses tired, I tired, too--that pinches.” “It pinches round, matter,” said Polly, “for half Sunday without you, know people like us; I know well I like mother dying; Jerry, dear, I sure break Sabbath; pulling poor beast donkey pit would spoil it, I quite sure taking poor Dinah would it.” “Why, Polly, good minister, so, I Sunday-morning sermon early to-day, may go tell Dinah I ready clock strikes ten; stop--just step round butcher Braydon's compliments, ask would lend light trap; I know never uses Sunday, would make wonderful difference horse.” Away went, soon returned, saying could trap welcome. “All right,” said he; “now put bit bread cheese, I back afternoon soon I can.” “And I meat pie ready early tea instead dinner,” said Polly; away went, made preparations tune “Polly's woman mistake”, tune fond. I selected journey, ten clock started, light, high-wheeled gig, ran easily four-wheeled cab seemed like nothing. It fine May day, soon town, sweet air, smell fresh grass, soft country roads pleasant used old times, I soon began feel quite fresh. Dinah's family lived small farmhouse, green lane, close meadow fine shady trees; two cows feeding it. A young man asked Jerry bring trap meadow, would tie cowshed; wished better stable offer. “If cows would offended,” said Jerry, “there nothing horse would like well hour two beautiful meadow; quiet, would rare treat him.” “Do, welcome,” said young man; “the best service kindness sister; shall dinner hour, I hope come in, though mother ill sorts house.” Jerry thanked kindly, said dinner nothing like well walking meadow. When harness taken I know I first--whether eat grass, roll back, lie rest, gallop across meadow sheer spirits free; I turns. Jerry seemed quite happy I was; sat bank shady tree, listened birds, sang himself, read little brown book fond of, wandered round meadow, little brook, picked flowers hawthorn, tied long sprays ivy; gave good feed oats brought him; time seemed short--I field since I left poor Ginger Earlshall. We came home gently, Jerry's first words were, came yard, “Well, Polly, I lost Sunday all, birds singing hymns every bush, I joined service; Jack, like young colt.” When handed Dolly flowers jumped joy. 38 Dolly Real Gentleman Winter came early, great deal cold wet. There snow, sleet, rain almost every day weeks, changing keen driving winds sharp frosts. The horses felt much. When dry cold couple good thick rugs keep warmth us; soaking rain soon get wet good. Some drivers waterproof cover throw over, fine thing; men poor could protect either horses, many suffered much winter. When horses worked half day went dry stables, could rest, sit boxes, sometimes staying late one two clock morning party wait for. When streets slippery frost snow worst us horses. One mile traveling, weight draw firm footing, would take us four good road; every nerve muscle bodies strain keep balance; and, added this, fear falling exhausting anything else. If roads bad indeed shoes roughed, makes us feel nervous first. When weather bad many men would go sit tavern close by, get one watch them; often lost fare way, could not, Jerry said, without spending money. He never went Rising Sun; coffee-shop near, went, bought old man, came rank tins hot coffee pies. It opinion spirits beer made man colder afterward, dry clothes, good food, cheerfulness, comfortable wife home, best things keep cabman warm. Polly always supplied something eat could get home, sometimes would see little Dolly peeping corner street, make sure “father” stand. If saw would run full speed soon come back something tin basket, hot soup pudding Polly ready. It wonderful little thing could get safely across street, often thronged horses carriages; brave little maid, felt quite honor bring “father's first course”, used call it. She general favorite stand, man would seen safely across street, Jerry able it. One cold windy day Dolly brought Jerry basin something hot, standing ate it. He scarcely begun gentleman, walking toward us fast, held umbrella. Jerry touched hat return, gave basin Dolly, taking cloth, gentleman, hastening up, cried out, “No, no, finish soup, friend; I much time spare, I wait till done, set little girl safe pavement.” So saying, seated cab. Jerry thanked kindly, came back Dolly. “There, Dolly, gentleman; real gentleman, Dolly; got time thought comfort poor cabman little girl.” Jerry finished soup, set child across, took orders drive Clapham Rise. Several times gentleman took cab. I think fond dogs horses, whenever took door two three dogs would come bounding meet him. Sometimes came round patted me, saying quiet, pleasant way, “This horse got good master, deserves it.” It rare thing one notice horse working him. I known ladies then, gentleman, one two others given pat kind word; ninety-nine persons hundred would soon think patting steam engine drew train. The gentleman young, forward stoop shoulders always going something. His lips thin close shut, though pleasant smile; eye keen, something jaw motion head made one think determined anything set about. His voice pleasant kind; horse would trust voice, though decided everything else him. One day another gentleman took cab; stopped shop R---- Street, friend went stood door. A little ahead us side street cart two fine horses standing wine vaults; carter them, I cannot tell long standing, seemed think waited long enough, began move off. Before gone many paces carter came running caught them. He seemed furious moved, whip rein punished brutally, even beating head. Our gentleman saw all, stepping quickly across street, said decided voice: “If stop directly, I arrested leaving horses, brutal conduct.” The man, clearly drinking, poured forth abusive language, left knocking horses about, taking reins, got cart; meantime friend quietly taken note-book pocket, looking name address painted cart, wrote something down. “What want that?” growled carter, cracked whip moving on. A nod grim smile answer got. On returning cab friend joined companion, said laughingly, “I thought, Wright, enough business look after, without troubling people's horses servants.” Our friend stood still moment, throwing head little back, “Do know world bad is?” “No,” said other. “Then I tell you. It people think business, trouble stand oppressed, bring wrongdoer light. I never see wicked thing like without I can, many master thanked letting know horses used.” “I wish gentlemen like you, sir,” said Jerry, “for wanted badly enough city.” After continued journey, got cab friend saying, “My doctrine this, see cruelty wrong power stop, nothing, make sharers guilt.” 39 Seedy Sam I say cab-horse I well indeed; driver owner, interest treat well overwork me, even good man was; great many horses belonged large cab-owners, let drivers much money day. As horses belong men thing thought get money them, first, pay master, provide living; dreadful time horses it. Of course, I understood little, often talked stand, governor, kind-hearted man fond horses, would sometimes speak one came much jaded ill-used. One day shabby, miserable-looking driver, went name “Seedy Sam”, brought horse looking dreadfully beat, governor said: “You horse look fit police station rank.” The man flung tattered rug horse, turned full round upon Governor said voice sounded almost desperate: “If police business matter ought masters charge us much, fares fixed low. If man pay eighteen shillings day use cab two horses, many us season, must make earn penny I say hard work; nine shillings day get horse begin get living. You know true, horses work must starve, I children known now. I six them, one earns anything; I stand fourteen sixteen hours day, I Sunday ten twelve weeks; know Skinner never gives day help it, I work hard, tell does! I want warm coat mackintosh, many feed man get it? I pledge clock week ago pay Skinner, I shall never see again.” Some drivers stood round nodding heads saying right. The man went on: “You horses cabs, drive good masters, chance getting chance right; I not. We cannot charge sixpence mile first, within four-mile radius. This morning I go clear six miles took three shillings. I could get return fare, come way back; twelve miles horse three shillings me. After I three-mile fare, bags boxes enough brought good many twopences put outside; know people do; could piled inside front seat put three heavy boxes went top. That sixpence, fare one sixpence; I got return shilling. Now makes eighteen miles horse six shillings me; three shillings still horse earn nine shillings afternoon horse I touch penny. Of course, always bad that, know often is, I say mockery tell man must overwork horse, beast downright tired nothing whip keep legs a-going; cannot help yourself--you must put wife children horse; masters must look that, cannot. I ill-use horse sake it; none say I do. There wrong lays somewhere--never day's rest, never quiet hour wife children. I often feel like old man, though I forty-five. You know quick gentry suspect us cheating overcharging; why, stand purses hands counting penny looking us pickpockets. I wish got sit box sixteen hours day get living eighteen shillings beside, weathers; would uncommon particular never give us sixpence cram luggage inside. Of course, tip us pretty handsome then, else could live; cannot depend upon that.” The men stood round much approved speech, one said, “It desperate hard, man sometimes wrong wonder, gets dram much blow up?” Jerry taken part conversation, I never saw face look sad before. The governor stood hands pockets; took handkerchief hat wiped forehead. “You beaten me, Sam,” said, “for true, I cast police; look horse's eye came me. It hard lines man hard lines beast, mend I know: anyway might tell poor beast sorry take way. Sometimes kind word give them, poor brutes, wonderful understand.” A mornings talk new man came stand Sam's cab. “Halloo!” said one, “what Seedy Sam?” “He ill bed,” said man; “he taken last night yard, could scarcely crawl home. His wife sent boy morning say father high fever could get out, I instead.” The next morning man came again. “How Sam?” inquired governor. “He gone,” said man. “What, gone? You mean say dead?” “Just snuffed out,” said other; “he died four clock morning; yesterday raving--raving Skinner, Sundays. 'I never Sunday's rest,' last words.” No one spoke while, governor said, “I tell what, mates, warning us.” 40 Poor Ginger One day, cab many others waiting outside one parks music playing, shabby old cab drove beside ours. The horse old worn-out chestnut, ill-kept coat, bones showed plainly it, knees knuckled over, fore-legs unsteady. I eating hay, wind rolled little lock way, poor creature put long thin neck picked up, turned looked more. There hopeless look dull eye I could help noticing, then, I thinking I seen horse before, looked full said, “Black Beauty, you?” It Ginger! changed! The beautifully arched glossy neck straight, lank, fallen in; clean straight legs delicate fetlocks swelled; joints grown shape hard work; face, full spirit life, full suffering, I could tell heaving sides, frequent cough, bad breath was. Our drivers standing together little way off, I sidled step two, might little quiet talk. It sad tale tell. After twelvemonth's run Earlshall, considered fit work again, sold gentleman. For little got well, longer gallop usual old strain returned, rested doctored sold. In way changed hands several times, always getting lower down. “And last,” said she, “I bought man keeps number cabs horses, let us out. You look well off, I glad it, I could tell life been. When found weakness said I worth gave me, I must go one low cabs, used up; doing, whipping working never one thought I suffer--they paid me, must get me, say. The man hires pays deal money owner every day, get too; week round round, never Sunday rest.” I said, “You used stand ill-used.” “Ah!” said, “I once, use; men strongest, cruel feeling, nothing do, bear it--bear end. I wish end come, I wish I dead. I seen dead horses, I sure suffer pain; I wish I may drop dead work, sent knackers.” I much troubled, I put nose hers, I could say nothing comfort her. I think pleased see me, said, “You friend I ever had.” Just driver came up, tug mouth backed line drove off, leaving sad indeed. A short time cart dead horse passed cab-stand. The head hung cart-tail, lifeless tongue slowly dropping blood; sunken eyes! I cannot speak them, sight dreadful. It chestnut horse long, thin neck. I saw white streak forehead. I believe Ginger; I hoped was, troubles would over. Oh! men merciful would shoot us came misery. 41 The Butcher I saw great deal trouble among horses London, much might prevented little common sense. We horses mind hard work treated reasonably, I sure many driven quite poor men happier life I I used go Countess W----'s carriage, silver-mounted harness high feeding. It often went heart see little ponies used, straining along heavy loads staggering heavy blows low, cruel boy. Once I saw little gray pony thick mane pretty head, much like Merrylegs I harness I neighed him. He best pull heavy cart, strong rough boy cutting belly whip chucking cruelly little mouth. Could Merrylegs? It like him; Mr. Blomefield never sell him, I think would it; might quite good little fellow, happy place young. I often noticed great speed butchers' horses made go, though I know till one day wait time St. John's Wood. There butcher's shop next door, standing butcher's cart came dashing great pace. The horse hot much exhausted; hung head down, heaving sides trembling legs showed hard driven. The lad jumped cart getting basket master came shop much displeased. After looking horse turned angrily lad. “How many times shall I tell drive way? You ruined last horse broke wind, going ruin way. If son I would dismiss spot; disgrace horse brought shop condition like that; liable taken police driving, need look bail, I spoken till I tired; must look yourself.” During speech boy stood by, sullen dogged, father ceased broke angrily. It fault, would take blame; going orders time. “You always say, 'Now quick; look sharp!' I go houses one wants leg mutton early dinner I must back quarter hour; another cook forgotten order beef; I must go fetch back time, mistress scold; housekeeper says company coming unexpectedly must chops sent directly; lady No. 4, Crescent, never orders dinner till meat comes lunch, nothing hurry, hurry, time. If gentry would think want, order meat day before, need blow up!” “I wish goodness would,” said butcher; “'twould save wonderful deal harass, I could suit customers much better I knew beforehand--But there! use talking--who ever thinks butcher's convenience butcher's horse! Now, then, take look well; mind, go to-day, anything else wanted must carry basket.” With went in, horse led away. But boys cruel. I seen fond pony donkey favorite dog, little creatures worked away cheerfully willingly young drivers I work Jerry. It may hard work sometimes, friend's hand voice make easy. There young coster-boy came street greens potatoes; old pony, handsome, cheerfullest pluckiest little thing I ever saw, see fond two treat. The pony followed master like dog, got cart would trot without whip word, rattle street merrily come queen's stables. Jerry liked boy, called “Prince Charlie”, said would make king drivers day. There old man, too, used come street little coal cart; wore coal-heaver's hat, looked rough black. He old horse used plod together along street, like two good partners understood other; horse would stop accord doors took coal him; used keep one ear bent toward master. The old man's cry could heard street long came near. I never knew said, children called “Old Ba-a-ar Hoo”, sounded like that. Polly took coal him, friendly, Jerry said comfort think happy old horse might poor place. 42 The Election As came yard one afternoon Polly came out. “Jerry! I Mr. B---- asking vote, wants hire cab election; call answer.” “Well, Polly, may say cab otherwise engaged. I like pasted great bills, making Jack Captain race public-houses bring half-drunken voters, why, I think 'twould insult horses. No, I shall it.” “I suppose vote gentleman? He said politics.” “So things, I shall vote him, Polly; know trade is?” “Yes.” “Well, man gets rich trade may well ways, blind workingmen want; I could conscience send make laws. I dare say angry, every man must thinks best country.” On morning election, Jerry putting shafts, Dolly came yard sobbing crying, little blue frock white pinafore spattered mud. “Why, Dolly, matter?” “Those naughty boys,” sobbed, “have thrown dirt me, called little raga--raga--” “They called little 'blue' ragamuffin, father,” said Harry, ran looking angry; “but I given them; insult sister again. I given thrashing remember; set cowardly, rascally 'orange' blackguards.” Jerry kissed child said, “Run mother, pet, tell I think better stay home to-day help her.” Then turning gravely Harry: “My boy, I hope always defend sister, give anybody insults good thrashing--that be; mind, I election blackguarding premises. There many 'blue' blackguards 'orange', many white purple, color, I family mixed it. Even women children ready quarrel sake color, one ten knows about.” “Why, father, I thought blue Liberty.” “My boy, Liberty come colors, show party, liberty get is, liberty get drunk people's expense, liberty ride poll dirty old cab, liberty abuse one wear color, shout hoarse half-understand--that liberty!” “Oh, father, laughing.” “No, Harry, I serious, I ashamed see men go ought know better. An election serious thing; least ought be, every man ought vote according conscience, let neighbor same.” 43 A Friend Need The election day came last; lack work Jerry me. First came stout puffy gentleman carpet bag; wanted go Bishopsgate station; called party wished taken Regent's Park; next wanted side street timid, anxious old lady waiting taken bank; stop take back again, set red-faced gentleman, handful papers, came running breath, Jerry could get opened door, popped in, called out, “Bow Street Police Station, quick!” went him, another turn two came back, cab stand. Jerry put nose-bag, said, “We must eat days these; munch away, Jack, make best time, old boy.” I found I good feed crushed oats wetted little bran; would treat day, refreshing then. Jerry thoughtful kind--what horse would best master? Then took one Polly's meat pies, standing near me, began eat it. The streets full, cabs, candidates' colors them, dashing crowd life limb consequence; saw two people knocked day, one woman. The horses bad time it, poor things! voters inside thought nothing that; many half-drunk, hurrahing cab windows party came by. It first election I seen, I want another, though I heard things better now. Jerry I eaten many mouthfuls poor young woman, carrying heavy child, came along street. She looking way way, seemed quite bewildered. Presently made way Jerry asked could tell way St. Thomas' Hospital, far get there. She come country morning, said, market cart; know election, quite stranger London. She got order hospital little boy. The child crying feeble, pining cry. “Poor little fellow!” said, “he suffers deal pain; four years old cannot walk baby; doctor said I could get hospital might get well; pray, sir, far it; way it?” “Why, missis,” said Jerry, “you cannot get walking crowds like this! why, three miles away, child heavy.” “Yes, bless him, is; I strong, thank God, I knew way I think I get somehow; please tell way.” “You cannot it,” said Jerry, “you might knocked child run over. Now look here, get cab, I drive safe hospital. Do see rain coming on?” “No, sir, no; I cannot that, thank you, I money enough get back with. Please tell way.” “Look here, missis,” said Jerry, “I got wife dear children home, I know father's feelings; get cab, I take nothing. I would ashamed let woman sick child run risk like that.” “Heaven bless you!” said woman, burst tears. “There, there, cheer up, dear, I soon take there; come, let put inside.” As Jerry went open door two men, colors hats buttonholes, ran calling out, “Cab!” “Engaged,” cried Jerry; one men, pushing past woman, sprang cab, followed other. Jerry looked stern policeman. “This cab already engaged, gentlemen, lady.” “Lady!” said one them; “oh! wait; business important, besides first, right, shall stay in.” A droll smile came Jerry's face shut door upon them. “All right, gentlemen, pray stay long suits you; I wait rest yourselves.” And turning back upon walked young woman, standing near me. “They soon gone,” said, laughing; “do trouble yourself, dear.” And soon gone, understood Jerry's dodge got out, calling sorts bad names blustering number getting summons. After little stoppage soon way hospital, going much possible by-streets. Jerry rung great bell helped young woman out. “Thank thousand times,” said; “I could never got alone.” “You kindly welcome, I hope dear child soon better.” He watched go door, gently said himself, “Inasmuch ye done one least these.” Then patted neck, always way anything pleased him. The rain coming fast, leaving hospital door opened again, porter called out, “Cab!” We stopped, lady came steps. Jerry seemed know once; put back veil said, “Barker! Jeremiah Barker, you? I glad find here; friend I want, difficult get cab part London to-day.” “I shall proud serve you, madam; I right glad I happened here. Where may I take to, madam?” “To Paddington Station, good time, I think shall be, shall tell Mary children.” We got station good time, shelter lady stood good talking Jerry. I found Polly's mistress, many inquiries said: “How find cab work suit winter? I know Mary rather anxious last year.” “Yes, madam, was; I bad cough followed quite warm weather, I kept late worry good deal. You see, madam, hours weathers, try man's constitution; I getting pretty well, I feel quite lost I horses look after. I brought it, I afraid I well anything else.” “Well, Barker,” said, “it would great pity seriously risk health work, Mary's children's sake; many places good drivers good grooms wanted, ever think ought give cab work let know.” Then sending kind messages Mary put something hand, saying, “There five shillings two children; Mary know spend it.” Jerry thanked seemed much pleased, turning station last reached home, I, least, tired. 44 Old Captain His Successor Captain I great friends. He noble old fellow, good company. I never thought would leave home go hill; turn came, happened. I there, I heard it. He Jerry taken party great railway station London Bridge, coming back, somewhere bridge monument, Jerry saw brewer's empty dray coming along, drawn two powerful horses. The drayman lashing horses heavy whip; dray light, started furious rate; man control them, street full traffic. One young girl knocked run over, next moment dashed cab; wheels torn cab thrown over. Captain dragged down, shafts splintered, one ran side. Jerry, too, thrown, bruised; nobody could tell escaped; always said miracle. When poor Captain got found much cut knocked about. Jerry led home gently, sad sight see blood soaking white coat dropping side shoulder. The drayman proved drunk, fined, brewer pay damages master; one pay damages poor Captain. The farrier Jerry best could ease pain make comfortable. The fly mended, several days I go out, Jerry earned nothing. The first time went stand accident governor came hear Captain was. “He never get it,” said Jerry, “at least work, farrier said morning. He says may carting, sort work. It put much. Carting, indeed! I seen horses come work round London. I wish drunkards could put lunatic asylum instead allowed run foul sober people. If would break bones, smash carts, lame horses, would affair, might let alone, seems innocent always suffer; talk compensation! You cannot make compensation; trouble, vexation, loss time, besides losing good horse like old friend--it nonsense talking compensation! If one devil I like see bottomless pit another, drink devil.” “I say, Jerry,” said governor, “you treading pretty hard toes, know; I good are, shame me; I wish I was.” “Well,” said Jerry, “why cut it, governor? You good man slave thing.” “I great fool, Jerry, I tried two days, I thought I died; do?” “I hard work several weeks; see I never get drunk, I found I master, craving came hard work say 'no'. I saw one us must knock under, drink devil Jerry Barker, I said Jerry Barker, God helping me; struggle, I wanted help I could get, till I tried break habit I know strong was; Polly took pains I good food, craving came I used get cup coffee, peppermint, read bit book, help me; sometimes I say myself, 'Give drink lose soul! Give drink break Polly's heart!' But thanks God, dear wife, chains broken, ten years I tasted drop, never wish it.” “I great mind try it,” said Grant, “for poor thing one's master.” “Do, governor, do, never repent it, help would poor fellows rank saw without it. I know two three would like keep tavern could.” At first Captain seemed well, old horse, wonderful constitution, Jerry's care, kept cab work long; broke much. The farrier said might mend enough sell pounds, Jerry said, no! pounds got selling good old servant hard work misery would canker rest money, thought kindest thing could fine old fellow would put sure bullet head, would never suffer more; know find kind master rest days. The day decided Harry took forge new shoes; I returned Captain gone. I family felt much. Jerry look another horse, soon heard one acquaintance under-groom nobleman's stables. He valuable young horse, run away, smashed another carriage, flung lordship out, cut blemished longer fit gentleman's stables, coachman orders look round, sell well could. “I high spirits,” said Jerry, “if horse vicious hard-mouthed.” “There bit vice him,” said man; “his mouth tender, I think accident; see clipped, weather bad, exercise enough, go full spring balloon. Our governor (the coachman, I mean) harnessed tight strong could, martingale, check-rein, sharp curb, reins put bottom bar. It belief made horse mad, tender mouth full spirit.” “Likely enough; I come see him,” said Jerry. The next day Hotspur, name, came home; fine brown horse, without white hair him, tall Captain, handsome head, five years old. I gave friendly greeting way good fellowship, ask questions. The first night restless. Instead lying down, kept jerking halter rope ring, knocking block manger till I could sleep. However, next day, five six hours cab, came quiet sensible. Jerry patted talked good deal, soon understood other, Jerry said easy bit plenty work would gentle lamb; ill wind blew nobody good, lordship lost hundred-guinea favorite, cabman gained good horse strength him. Hotspur thought great come-down cab-horse, disgusted standing rank, confessed end week easy mouth free head made great deal, all, work degrading one's head tail fastened saddle. In fact, settled well, Jerry liked much. 45 Jerry's New Year For people Christmas New Year merry times; cabmen cabmen's horses holiday, though may harvest. There many parties, balls, places amusement open work hard often late. Sometimes driver horse wait hours rain frost, shivering cold, merry people within dancing away music. I wonder beautiful ladies ever think weary cabman waiting box, patient beast standing, till legs get stiff cold. I evening work, I well accustomed standing, Jerry also afraid Hotspur taking cold. We great deal late work Christmas week, Jerry's cough bad; however late were, Polly sat him, came lantern meet him, looking anxious troubled. On evening New Year take two gentlemen house one West End Squares. We set nine clock, told come eleven, “but,” said one, “as card party, may wait minutes, late.” As clock struck eleven door, Jerry always punctual. The clock chimed quarters, one, two, three, struck twelve, door open. The wind changeable, squalls rain day, came sharp, driving sleet, seemed come way round; cold, shelter. Jerry got box came pulled one cloths little neck; took turn two down, stamping feet; began beat arms, set coughing; opened cab door sat bottom feet pavement, little sheltered. Still clock chimed quarters, one came. At half-past twelve rang bell asked servant would wanted night. “Oh, yes, wanted safe enough,” said man; “you must go, soon over,” Jerry sat down, voice hoarse I could hardly hear him. At quarter past one door opened, two gentlemen came out; got cab without word, told Jerry drive, nearly two miles. My legs numb cold, I thought I stumbled. When men got never said sorry kept us waiting long, angry charge; however, Jerry never charged due, never took less, pay two hours quarter waiting; hard-earned money Jerry. At last got home; could hardly speak, cough dreadful. Polly asked questions, opened door held lantern him. “Cannot I something?” said. “Yes; get Jack something warm, boil gruel.” This said hoarse whisper; could hardly get breath, gave rub-down usual, even went hayloft extra bundle straw bed. Polly brought warm mash made comfortable, locked door. It late next morning one came, Harry. He cleaned us fed us, swept stalls, put straw back Sunday. He still, neither whistled sang. At noon came gave us food water; time Dolly came him; crying, I could gather said Jerry dangerously ill, doctor said bad case. So two days passed, great trouble indoors. We saw Harry, sometimes Dolly. I think came company, Polly always Jerry, kept quiet. On third day, Harry stable, tap came door, Governor Grant came in. “I would go house, boy,” said, “but I want know father is.” “He bad,” said Harry, “he cannot much worse; call 'bronchitis'; doctor thinks turn one way another to-night.” “That bad, bad,” said Grant, shaking head; “I know two men died last week; takes time; life hope, must keep spirits.” “Yes,” said Harry quickly, “and doctor said father better chance men, drink. He said yesterday fever high father drinking man would burned like piece paper; I believe thinks get it; think will, Mr. Grant?” The governor looked puzzled. “If rule good men get things, I sure will, boy; best man I know. I look early to-morrow.” Early next morning there. “Well?” said he. “Father better,” said Harry. “Mother hopes get it.” “Thank God!” said governor, “and must keep warm, keep mind easy, brings horses; see Jack better rest week two warm stable, easily take turn street stretch legs; young one, get work, soon end, may say, rather much you; go accident.” “It like now,” said Harry. “I kept short corn, full spirit I know him.” “Just so,” said Grant. “Now look here, tell mother agreeable I come every day till something arranged, take good spell work, whatever earns, I bring mother half it, help horses' feed. Your father good club, I know, keep horses, eating heads time; I come noon hear says,” without waiting Harry's thanks gone. At noon I think went saw Polly, Harry came stable together, harnessed Hotspur, took out. For week came Hotspur, Harry thanked said anything kindness, laughed off, saying good luck him, horses wanting little rest would otherwise had. Jerry grew better steadily, doctor said must never go back cab work wished old man. The children many consultations together father mother would do, could help earn money. One afternoon Hotspur brought wet dirty. “The streets nothing slush,” said governor; “it give good warming, boy, get clean dry.” “All right, governor,” said Harry, “I shall leave till is; know I trained father.” “I wish boys trained like you,” said governor. While Harry sponging mud Hotspur's body legs Dolly came in, looking full something. “Who lives Fairstowe, Harry? Mother got letter Fairstowe; seemed glad, ran upstairs father it.” “Do know? Why, name Mrs. Fowler's place--mother's old mistress, know--the lady father met last summer, sent five shillings each.” “Oh! Mrs. Fowler. Of course, I know her. I wonder writing mother about.” “Mother wrote last week,” said Harry; “you know told father ever gave cab work would like know. I wonder says; run see, Dolly.” Harry scrubbed away Hotspur huish! huish! like old hostler. In minutes Dolly came dancing stable. “Oh! Harry, never anything beautiful; Mrs. Fowler says go live near her. There cottage empty suit us, garden henhouse, apple-trees, everything! coachman going away spring, want father place; good families round, get place garden stable, page-boy; good school me; mother laughing crying turns, father look happy!” “That uncommon jolly,” said Harry, “and right thing, I say; suit father mother both; I intend page-boy tight clothes rows buttons. I groom gardener.” It quickly settled soon Jerry well enough remove country, cab horses sold soon possible. This heavy news me, I young now, could look improvement condition. Since I left Birtwick I never happy dear master Jerry; three years cab work, even best conditions, tell one's strength, I felt I horse I been. Grant said would take Hotspur, men stand would bought me; Jerry said I go cab work anybody, governor promised find place I comfortable. The day came going away. Jerry allowed go yet, I never saw New Year's eve. Polly children came bid good-by. “Poor old Jack! dear old Jack! I wish could take us,” said, laying hand mane put face close neck kissed me. Dolly crying kissed too. Harry stroked great deal, said nothing, seemed sad, I led away new place. Part IV 46 Jakes Lady I sold corn dealer baker, Jerry knew, thought I good food fair work. In first quite right, master always premises I think I overloaded, foreman always hurrying driving every one, frequently I quite full load would order something else taken on. My carter, whose name Jakes, often said I ought take, always overruled him. “It Was use going twice would do, chose get business forward.” Jakes, like carters, always check-rein up, prevented drawing easily, time I three four months I found work telling much strength. One day I loaded usual, part road steep uphill. I used strength, I could get on, obliged continually stop. This please driver, laid whip badly. “Get on, lazy fellow,” said, “or I make you.” Again I started heavy load, struggled yards; whip came down, I struggled forward. The pain great cart whip sharp, mind hurt quite much poor sides. To punished abused I best hard took heart me. A third time flogging cruelly, lady stepped quickly him, said sweet, earnest voice: “Oh! pray whip good horse more; I sure can, road steep; I sure best.” “If best get load must something best; I know, madam,” said Jakes. “But heavy load?” said. “Yes, yes, heavy,” said; “but fault; foreman came starting, would three hundredweight put save trouble, I must get well I can.” He raising whip again, lady said: “Pray, stop; I think I help let me.” The man laughed. “You see,” said, “you give fair chance; cannot use power head held back check-rein; would take I sure would better--do try it,” said persuasively, “I glad would.” “Well, well,” said Jakes, short laugh, “anything please lady, course. How far would wish down, madam?” “Quite down, give head altogether.” The rein taken off, moment I put head knees. What comfort was! Then I tossed several times get aching stiffness neck. “Poor fellow! wanted,” said she, patting stroking gentle hand; “and speak kindly lead I believe able better.” Jakes took rein. “Come on, Blackie.” I put head, threw whole weight collar; I spared strength; load moved on, I pulled steadily hill, stopped take breath. The lady walked along footpath, came across road. She stroked patted neck, I patted many long day. “You see quite willing gave chance; I sure fine-tempered creature, I dare say known better days. You put rein again, you?” going hitch old plan. “Well, madam, I cannot deny head helped hill, I remember another time, thank you, madam; went without check-rein I laughing-stock carters; fashion, see.” “Is better,” said, “to lead good fashion follow bad one? A great many gentlemen use check-reins now; carriage horses worn fifteen years, work much less fatigue them; besides,” added serious voice, “we right distress God's creatures without good reason; call dumb animals, are, cannot tell us feel, suffer less words. But I must detain now; I thank trying plan good horse, I sure find far better whip. Good-day,” another soft pat neck stepped lightly across path, I saw more. “That real lady, I bound it,” said Jakes himself; “she spoke polite I gentleman, I try plan, uphill, rate;” I must justice say let rein several holes, going uphill that, always gave head; heavy loads went on. Good feed fair rest keep one's strength full work, horse stand overloading; I getting thoroughly pulled younger horse bought place. I may well mention I suffered time another because. I heard horses speak it, never experience evil; badly-lighted stable; one small window end, consequence stalls almost dark. Besides depressing effect spirits, much weakened sight, I suddenly brought darkness glare daylight painful eyes. Several times I stumbled threshold, could scarcely see I going. I believe, I stayed long, I become purblind, would great misfortune, I heard men say stone-blind horse safer drive one imperfect sight, generally makes timid. However, I escaped without permanent injury sight, sold large cab owner. 47 Hard Times My new master I shall never forget; black eyes hooked nose, mouth full teeth bull-dog's, voice harsh grinding cart wheels graveled stones. His name Nicholas Skinner, I believe man poor Seedy Sam drove for. I heard men say seeing believing; I say feeling believing; much I seen before, I never knew till utter misery cab-horse's life. Skinner low set cabs low set drivers; hard men, men hard horses. In place Sunday rest, heat summer. Sometimes Sunday morning party fast men would hire cab day; four inside another driver, I take ten fifteen miles country, back again; never would get walk hill, let ever steep, day ever hot--unless, indeed, driver afraid I manage it, sometimes I fevered worn I could hardly touch food. How I used long nice bran mash niter Jerry used give us Saturday nights hot weather, used cool us make us comfortable. Then two nights whole day unbroken rest, Monday morning fresh young horses again; rest, driver hard master. He cruel whip something sharp end sometimes drew blood, would even whip belly, flip lash head. Indignities like took heart terribly, still I best never hung back; for, poor Ginger said, use; men strongest. My life utterly wretched I wished I might, like Ginger, drop dead work misery, one day wish nearly came pass. I went stand eight morning, done good share work, take fare railway. A long train expected in, driver pulled back outside cabs take chance return fare. It heavy train, cabs soon engaged called for. There party four; noisy, blustering man lady, little boy young girl, great deal luggage. The lady boy got cab, man ordered luggage young girl came looked me. “Papa,” said, “I sure poor horse cannot take us luggage far, weak worn up. Do look him.” “Oh! right, miss,” said driver, “he strong enough.” The porter, pulling heavy boxes, suggested gentleman, much luggage, whether would take second cab. “Can horse it, cannot he?” said blustering man. “Oh! right, sir; send boxes, porter; could take that;” helped haul box heavy I could feel springs go down. “Papa, papa, take second cab,” said young girl beseeching tone. “I sure wrong, I sure cruel.” “Nonsense, Grace, get once, make fuss; pretty thing would man business examine every cab-horse hired it--the man knows business course; there, get hold tongue!” My gentle friend obey, box box dragged lodged top cab settled side driver. At last ready, usual jerk rein slash whip drove station. The load heavy I neither food rest since morning; I best, I always done, spite cruelty injustice. I got along fairly till came Ludgate Hill; heavy load exhaustion much. I struggling keep on, goaded constant chucks rein use whip, single moment--I cannot tell how--my feet slipped me, I fell heavily ground side; suddenness force I fell seemed beat breath body. I lay perfectly still; indeed, I power move, I thought I going die. I heard sort confusion round me, loud, angry voices, getting luggage, like dream. I thought I heard sweet, pitiful voice saying, “Oh! poor horse! fault.” Some one came loosened throat strap bridle, undid traces kept collar tight upon me. Some one said, “He dead, never get again.” Then I could hear policeman giving orders, I even open eyes; I could draw gasping breath then. Some cold water thrown head, cordial poured mouth, something covered me. I cannot tell long I lay there, I found life coming back, kind-voiced man patting encouraging rise. After cordial given me, one two attempts, I staggered feet, gently led stables close by. Here I put well-littered stall, warm gruel brought me, I drank thankfully. In evening I sufficiently recovered led back Skinner's stables, I think best could. In morning Skinner came farrier look me. He examined closely said: “This case overwork disease, could give run six months would able work again; ounce strength left him.” “Then must go dogs,” said Skinner. “I meadows nurse sick horses in--he might get well might not; sort thing suit business; plan work long go, sell fetch, knacker's elsewhere.” “If broken-winded,” said farrier, “you better killed hand, not; sale horses coming ten days; rest feed may pick up, may get skin worth, rate.” Upon advice Skinner, rather unwillingly, I think, gave orders I well fed cared for, stable man, happily me, carried orders much better master giving them. Ten days perfect rest, plenty good oats, hay, bran mashes, boiled linseed mixed them, get condition anything else could done; linseed mashes delicious, I began think, all, might better live go dogs. When twelfth day accident came, I taken sale, miles London. I felt change present place must improvement, I held head, hoped best. 48 Farmer Thoroughgood His Grandson Willie At sale, course I found company old broken-down horses--some lame, broken-winded, old, I sure would merciful shoot. The buyers sellers, too, many them, looked much better poor beasts bargaining about. There poor old men, trying get horse pony pounds, might drag little wood coal cart. There poor men trying sell worn-out beast two three pounds, rather greater loss killing him. Some looked poverty hard times hardened over; others I would willingly used last strength serving; poor shabby, kind human, voices I could trust. There one tottering old man took great fancy me, I him, I strong enough--it anxious time! Coming better part fair, I noticed man looked like gentleman farmer, young boy side; broad back round shoulders, kind, ruddy face, wore broad-brimmed hat. When came companions stood still gave pitiful look round upon us. I saw eye rest me; I still good mane tail, something appearance. I pricked ears looked him. “There horse, Willie, known better days.” “Poor old fellow!” said boy, “do think, grandpapa, ever carriage horse?” “Oh, yes! boy,” said farmer, coming closer, “he might anything young; look nostrils ears, shape neck shoulder; deal breeding horse.” He put hand gave kind pat neck. I put nose answer kindness; boy stroked face. “Poor old fellow! see, grandpapa, well understands kindness. Could buy make young Ladybird?” “My dear boy, I cannot make old horses young; besides, Ladybird old, run badly used.” “Well, grandpapa, I believe one old; look mane tail. I wish would look mouth, could tell; though thin, eyes sunk like old horses'.” The old gentleman laughed. “Bless boy! horsey old grandfather.” “But look mouth, grandpapa, ask price; I sure would grow young meadows.” The man brought sale put word. “The young gentleman's real knowing one, sir. Now fact is, 'ere hoss pulled overwork cabs; old one, I heerd vetenary say, six months' run would set right up, wind broken. I tending ten days past, gratefuller, pleasanter animal I never met with, 'twould worth gentleman's give five-pound note him, let chance. I bound would worth twenty pounds next spring.” The old gentleman laughed, little boy looked eagerly. “Oh, grandpapa, say colt sold five pounds expected? You would poorer buy one.” The farmer slowly felt legs, much swelled strained; looked mouth. “Thirteen fourteen, I say; trot out, you?” I arched poor thin neck, raised tail little, threw legs well I could, stiff. “What lowest take him?” said farmer I came back. “Five pounds, sir; lowest price master set.” “It Is speculation,” said old gentleman, shaking head, time slowly drawing purse, “quite speculation! Have business here?” said, counting sovereigns hand. “No, sir, I take inn, please.” “Do so, I going there.” They walked forward, I led behind. The boy could hardly control delight, old gentleman seemed enjoy pleasure. I good feed inn, gently ridden home servant new master's, turned large meadow would one corner it. Mr. Thoroughgood, name benefactor, gave orders I hay oats every night morning, run meadow day, and, “you, Willie,” said he, “must take oversight him; I give charge you.” The boy proud charge, undertook seriousness. There day pay visit; sometimes picking among horses, giving bit carrot, something good, sometimes standing I ate oats. He always came kind words caresses, course I grew fond him. He called Old Crony, I used come field follow about. Sometimes brought grandfather, always looked closely legs. “This point, Willie,” would say; “but improving steadily I think shall see change better spring.” The perfect rest, good food, soft turf, gentle exercise, soon began tell condition spirits. I good constitution mother, I never strained I young, I better chance many horses worked came full strength. During winter legs improved much I began feel quite young again. The spring came round, one day March Mr. Thoroughgood determined would try phaeton. I well pleased, Willie drove miles. My legs stiff now, I work perfect ease. “He growing young, Willie; must give little gentle work now, mid-summer good Ladybird. He beautiful mouth good paces; cannot better.” “Oh, grandpapa, glad I bought him!” “So I, boy; thank me; must looking quiet, genteel place him, valued.” 49 My Last Home One day summer groom cleaned dressed extraordinary care I thought new change must hand; trimmed fetlocks legs, passed tarbrush hoofs, even parted forelock. I think harness extra polish. Willie seemed half-anxious, half-merry, got chaise grandfather. “If ladies take him,” said old gentleman, “they suited suited. We try.” At distance mile two village came pretty, low house, lawn shrubbery front drive door. Willie rang bell, asked Miss Blomefield Miss Ellen home. Yes, were. So, Willie stayed me, Mr. Thoroughgood went house. In ten minutes returned, followed three ladies; one tall, pale lady, wrapped white shawl, leaned younger lady, dark eyes merry face; other, stately-looking person, Miss Blomefield. They came looked asked questions. The younger lady--that Miss Ellen--took much; said sure like me, I good face. The tall, pale lady said always nervous riding behind horse down, I might come again, I never get fright. “You see, ladies,” said Mr. Thoroughgood, “many first-rate horses knees broken carelessness drivers without fault own, I see horse I say case; course I wish influence you. If incline trial, coachman see thinks him.” “You always good adviser us horses,” said stately lady, “that recommendation would go long way me, sister Lavinia sees objection accept offer trial, thanks.” It arranged I sent next day. In morning smart-looking young man came me. At first looked pleased; saw knees said disappointed voice: “I think, sir, would recommended ladies blemished horse like that.” “'Handsome handsome does',” said master; “you taking trial, I sure fairly him, young man. If safe horse ever drove send back.” I led new home, placed comfortable stable, fed, left myself. The next day, groom cleaning face, said: “That like star 'Black Beauty' had; much height, too. I wonder now.” A little came place neck I bled little knot left skin. He almost started, began look carefully, talking himself. “White star forehead, one white foot side, little knot place;” looking middle back--“and, I alive, little patch white hair John used call 'Beauty's three-penny bit'. It must 'Black Beauty'! Why, Beauty! Beauty! know me?--little Joe Green, almost killed you?” And began patting patting quite overjoyed. I could say I remembered him, fine grown young fellow, black whiskers man's voice, I sure knew me, Joe Green, I glad. I put nose him, tried say friends. I never saw man pleased. “Give fair trial! I think indeed! I wonder rascal broke knees, old Beauty! must badly served somewhere; well, well, fault good times now. I wish John Manly see you.” In afternoon I put low park chair brought door. Miss Ellen going try me, Green went her. I soon found good driver, seemed pleased paces. I heard Joe telling me, sure I Squire Gordon's old “Black Beauty”. When returned sisters came hear I behaved myself. She told heard, said: “I shall certainly write Mrs. Gordon, tell favorite horse come us. How pleased be!” After I driven every day week so, I appeared quite safe, Miss Lavinia last ventured small close carriage. After quite decided keep call old name “Black Beauty”. I lived happy place whole year. Joe best kindest grooms. My work easy pleasant, I feel strength spirits coming back again. Mr. Thoroughgood said Joe day: “In place last till twenty years old--perhaps more.” Willie always speaks can, treats special friend. My ladies promised I shall never sold, I nothing fear; story ends. My troubles over, I home; often I quite awake, I fancy I still orchard Birtwick, standing old friends apple-trees.
