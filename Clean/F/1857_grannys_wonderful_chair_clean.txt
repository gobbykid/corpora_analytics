 GRANNY'S WONDERFUL CHAIR CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY In old time, long ago, fairies world, lived little girl fair pleasant look, called Snowflower. This girl good well pretty. No one ever seen frown heard say cross word, young old glad saw coming. Snowflower relation world old grandmother, called Dame Frostyface. People like quite well granddaughter, cross enough times, though always kind Snowflower. They lived together little cottage built peat thatched reeds, edge great forest. Tall trees sheltered back north wind, midday sun made front warm cheerful. Swallows built eaves, daisies grew thick door. But none country poorer Snowflower grandmother. A cat two hens live stock. Their bed dry grass, good piece furniture cottage great armchair wheels feet, black velvet cushion, many strange carvings flowers fairies dark oaken back. On chair Dame Frostyface sat spinning morning till night, keep granddaughter, Snowflower gathered sticks fire, looked hens cat, whatever else grandmother bade her. There nobody part country could spin fine yarn Dame Frostyface, spun slowly. Her wheel old herself, far worn-out. Indeed, wonder fall pieces. So dame earned little, living scanty. Snowflower, however, felt want good dinners fine clothes. Every evening, fire heaped sticks gathered till blazed crackled cottage chimney, Dame Frostyface set aside wheel told new story. Often little girl wonder grandmother gathered many stories, soon learned that. One sunny morning, time coming swallows, dame rose up, put grey hood cloak carried yarn fairs, said: "My child, I going long journey visit aunt mine, lives far north country. I cannot take me, aunt crossest woman alive, never liked young people. But hens lay eggs you, barley meal barrel. And, good girl, I tell feel lonely. Lay head gently cushion armchair say, 'Chair grandmother, tell story'. "The chair made clever fairy, lived forest I young, gave knew nobody could keep got hold better I could. Remember, must never ask story day. If need travel, seat say, 'Chair grandmother, take way'. It carry wherever wish. But mind oil wheels set out, I sat forty years corner." Having said this, Dame Frostyface set forth see aunt north country. Snowflower gathered wood fire, looked hens cat, always done. She baked cake two barley meal; but, evening came, cottage looked lonely. Then Snowflower remembered grandmother's words, and, laying head gently down, said: "Chair grandmother, tell story". Hardly words spoken, clear voice velvet cushion began new wonderful tale, surprised Snowflower much forgot afraid. After good girl lonely more. Every morning baked barley cake, every evening chair told new story. But could never find voice belonged, though Snowflower showed thanks keeping bright oaken back dusting velvet cushion, till chair looked good new. The swallows came built eaves, daisies grew thicker ever door, great troubles fell upon Snowflower. In spite care forgot clip hens' wings, flew away one morning visit friends pheasants, lived far forest. The cat went away see friends. The barley meal eaten up, except two handfuls, Snowflower often looked hope seeing grey cloak, Dame Frostyface come back. "My grandmother stays long," said Snowflower herself; "and nothing left eat. If I could get her, perhaps would tell do. Surely good need travel." Next day, sunrise, Snowflower oiled wheels chair, baked cake last meal, took lap way food journey, seated herself, said: "Chair grandmother, take way went". At chair gave creak, began move cottage, forest, way Dame Frostyface taken, rolled along rate coach six. Snowflower amazed way travelling, chair never stopped stayed whole summer day, till sun setting came upon open space, hundred men cutting tall trees axes, hundred splitting firewood, twenty men, horses wagons, carrying wood away. "Oh! chair grandmother, stop!" said Snowflower, tired, also wished know might mean. The chair stood still, Snowflower, seeing old woodcutter, looked kind, stepped said: "Good father, tell cut wood?" "Where live," replied man, "that heard great feast King Winwealth means give birthday daughter, Princess Greedalind? It last seven days. Everybody feasted, wood roast oxen sheep, geese turkeys, amongst great sorrow throughout land." When Snowflower heard that, could help wishing see, perhaps share in, noble feast, living long barley cakes. So, seating herself, said: "Chair grandmother, take quickly palace King Winwealth." The words hardly spoken, chair started trees forest, great surprise woodcutters, who, never seen sight before, threw axes, left wagons, went Snowflower gates great splendid city, strong walls high towers, standing midst wide plain covered cornfields, fruit gardens, villages. It richest city land. People every part land came buy sell, saying live seven years make fortunes. Rich were, however, Snowflower never seen many discontented, greedy faces looked great shops, grand houses, fine coaches, chair rattled along streets. Indeed, people city much thought either good nature honesty. But King Winwealth young, brother, Prince Wisewit, governed land. Prince Wisewit knew whole art governing, tempers men, powers stars. Moreover, clever man, said could never die grow old. In time neither discontent sickness city. Strangers kindly treated without price questions. Then one went law neighbour, one locked door night. The fairies used come May Day Michaelmas, Prince Wisewit's friends--all one, called Fortunetta, short-sighted cunning fairy, hated everybody wiser herself, prince, could never cheat him. There peace pleasure many year King Winwealth's city, till one day midsummer Prince Wisewit went alone forest, search strange plant garden, never came back. Though King, guards, looked far near, news ever heard him. When brother gone, King Winwealth grew lonely great palace, married princess called Wantall, brought home queen. This princess neither handsome pleasant. People thought must gained King's love charms worked, whole dowry desert island, huge pit could never filled, greedy got greedier grew. In course time King Queen daughter, heiress kingdom. Her name Princess Greedalind, whole city time preparing keep birthday. Not cared much Princess, like mother looks temper; King Winwealth's daughter, people came far near feast, among strangers fairies since day Prince Wisewit. There great stir palace, noble building, large room every day year. All floors beautiful dark wood, roofs silver; large number golden dishes used household, five hundred men kept guard night day lest stolen. When guards saw Snowflower chair, ran one tell King, like never seen heard kingdom, Court crowded see little maiden chair came itself. When Snowflower saw lords ladies fine robes splendid jewels, began feel ashamed bare feet linen gown. But length taking courage, answered questions, told everything wonderful chair. The Queen Princess cared nothing gilt. The people Court learned same, turned away great scorn except old King, who, thinking chair might amuse sometimes got low spirits, allowed Snowflower stay feast worst kitchen. The poor girl glad place, though nobody made welcome--even servants looked upon bare feet linen gown. They would give chair room dusty corner behind back door, Snowflower told might sleep night, eat scraps cook threw away. That day feast began. It fine see great crowds coaches people foot horseback came palace, filled every room according rank. Never Snowflower seen roasting boiling. There wine lords ale common people, music dancing kinds, best gay dresses. But good cheer seemed little joy, great deal ill humour palace. Some guests thought feasted grander rooms. Others vexed see many finer themselves. All servants displeased get presents. There somebody caught every hour stealing cups, great number people always gates shouting goods lands, Queen Wantall taken them. The guards always driving away, came back again, could heard plainly highest hall. So wonderful old King's spirits low evening supper. His page, always stood behind him, seeing this, reminded His Majesty little girl chair. "It good thought," said King Winwealth. "I heard story many year. Bring child chair once!" The page sent someone first kitchen, told master-cook; master-cook told kitchen-maid; kitchen-maid told dust-boy, told Snowflower wash face, rub chair, go highest hall, great King Winwealth wished hear story. Nobody offered help her; Snowflower made smart could soap water, rubbed chair till looked dust never fallen it, seated said: "Chair grandmother, take highest hall." At chair marched grave courtly manner kitchen, grand staircase, highest hall. The chief lords ladies land feasting there, besides many fairies noble people far-off countries. There never company palace since time Prince Wisewit. Nobody wore less finest satin. King Winwealth sat ivory throne robe purple velvet, stiff flowers gold. The Queen sat side robe silver cloth clasped pearls. But Princess Greedalind finer still, feast honour. She wore robe cloth gold clasped diamonds. Two waiting-ladies white satin stood, one either side, hold fan handkerchief, two pages, gold-lace livery, stood behind chair. With that, Princess Greedalind looked ugly spiteful. She mother angry see barefooted girl old chair allowed enter highest hall. The supper table still covered golden dishes, best good things, one offered Snowflower morsel. So, made humble bow King, Queen, Princess, good company, hardly noticed her, poor little girl sat upon carpet, laid head velvet cushion, used old cottage, said: "Chair grandmother, tell story." Everybody greatly surprised, even angry Queen spiteful Princess, clear voice cushion said: "Listen story Christmas Cuckoo." CHAPTER II THE CHRISTMAS CUCKOO Once upon time stood midst bleak moor, north country, certain village. All people poor, fields barren, little trade; poorest two brothers called Scrub Spare. They cobblers, one stall them. It hut built clay wattles. The door low always open, window. The roof entirely keep rain, thing look comfort wide hearth, brothers could never find wood enough make good fire. There worked brotherly friendship, though people give many shoes make mend. The people village need many shoes, better cobblers Scrub Spare might found. Spiteful people said shoes bad would worse mending. Nevertheless Scrub Spare managed live means trade, small barley field, cottage garden, till new cobbler arrived village. He lived chief city kingdom, and, account, cobbled Queen princesses. His awls sharp lasts new. He set stall neat cottage two windows. The villagers soon found one patch would outwear two brothers'. In short, mending left Scrub Spare, went new cobbler. The season wet cold, barley ripen well, cabbages never half closed garden. So brothers poor winter; Christmas came, nothing feast barley loaf, piece musty bacon, small beer brewing. Worse that, snow deep, could get firewood. Their hut stood end village; beyond spread bleak moor, white silent. But moor forest. Great roots old trees still found it, loosened soil laid bare winds rains. One these, rough, heavy log, lay close door, half snow. Spare said brother: "Shall sit cold Christmas Day great root lies yonder? Let us chop firewood, work make us warm." "No," said Scrub; "it right chop wood Christmas. Besides, root hard cut axe." "Hard not, must fire," replied Spare. "Come, brother, help it. Poor are, nobody village Yule log ours." Scrub liked little grand sometimes, hopes fine Yule log, brothers strove might till, pulling pushing, great old root safe hearth, soon began crackle blaze red embers. In high glee, cobblers sat beer bacon. The door shut, nothing cold moonlight snow outside. But hut, strewn fir branches, decked holly, looked cheerful ruddy blaze flared made hearts glad. "Long life good fortune ourselves, brother!" said Spare. "I hope drink toast, may never worse fire Christmas--but that?" Spare set drinking-horn, brothers listened great surprise, blazing root heard "Cuckoo! cuckoo!" plain ever spring bird's voice came moor May morn. "It something bad," said Scrub, much frightened. "Maybe not," said Spare. And deep hole side fire reached flew large grey cuckoo, alighted table them. Much cobblers surprised first, still bird began speak. "Good gentlemen," said cuckoo, "what season this?" "It Christmas," replied Spare. "Then merry Christmas you!" said cuckoo. "I went sleep hollow old root last summer, never woke till heat fire made think summer again. But now, since burned lodging, let stay hut till spring comes round--I want hole sleep in, I go travels next summer may sure I bring gift trouble." "Stay, welcome," said Spare, Scrub sat wondering something bad not. "I make good warm hole thatch. But must hungry long sleep. There slice barley bread. Come, help us keep Christmas!" The cuckoo ate slice, drank water brown jug--for would take beer--and flew snug hole Spare scooped thatch hut. Scrub said afraid bird would lucky. But slept on, days passed, forgot fears. So snow melted, heavy rains came, cold grew less, days became longer; one sunny morning brothers awakened cuckoo shouting cry let know spring come. "Now," said bird, "I going travels world tell men spring. There country trees bud, flowers bloom, I cry year goes round. Give another slice bread keep journey, tell gift I shall bring end twelve months." Scrub would angry brother cutting large slice, store barley meal low; mind taken present would best ask. At length lucky thought struck him. "Good Master Cuckoo," said he, "if great traveller sees world like you, could know place diamonds pearls found, one fairly large size brought beak would help poor men brother get something better barley bread give next time come." "I know nothing diamonds pearls," said cuckoo. "They hearts rocks sands rivers. I know grows earth. But two trees close well lies end world. One called golden tree, leaves beaten gold. Every winter fall well sound like scattered gold, I know becomes them. As other, always green, like laurel. Some call wise, merry tree. Its leaves never fall get one keep cheerful heart spite troubles, make merry hut palace." "Good Master Cuckoo, bring leaf tree!" cried Spare. "Now, brother, fool!" said Scrub. "Think leaves gold. Dear Master Cuckoo, bring one them!" Before another word could said, cuckoo flown open door, shouting spring cry moor meadow. The brothers poorer ever year. Nobody sent single shoe mend. The new cobbler said, scorn, come work him. Scrub Spare would left village barley field, cabbage garden, maid called Fairfeather, cobblers courted seven years without even knowing meant favour. Sometimes Fairfeather seemed favour Scrub, sometimes smiled Spare; brothers always friends quarrel. They sowed barley, planted cabbage, and, trade gone, worked fields rich villagers make scanty living. So seasons came passed. Spring, summer, harvest, winter followed always done. At end winter Scrub Spare grown poor ragged Fairfeather thought beneath notice. Old neighbours forgot invite wedding feasts merrymaking. They thought cuckoo forgotten too, daybreak, first April, heard hard beak knocking door voice crying: "Cuckoo! cuckoo! let gifts." Spare ran open door, came cuckoo, carrying one side bill golden leaf larger tree north country; other, one like common laurel, fresher green. "Here," said, giving gold Scrub green Spare; "it long way carry end world. Give slice bread, I must tell north country spring come." Scrub grudge thickness slice, though cut last loaf. So much gold never cobbler's hands before, could help exulting brother. "See wisdom choice!" said, holding large leaf gold. "As yours, good might plucked hedge. I wonder wise bird would carry like far." "Good Master Cobbler," cried cuckoo, finishing slice, "your words hasty kind. If brother disappointed time, I go journey every year, kind treatment think trouble bring whichever leaf wish." "Darling cuckoo!" cried Scrub, "bring golden one." And Spare, looking green leaf gazed though crown-jewel, said: "Be sure bring one merry tree." And away flew cuckoo again. "This Feast All Fools, ought birthday," said Scrub. "Did ever man fling away chance becoming rich! Much good merry leaves poor!" So went on; Spare laughed him, answered many old proverbs cares come gold, till Scrub, length growing angry, vowed brother fit live gentleman like himself. And taking lasts, awls, golden leaf, left wattle hut went tell villagers. They surprised folly Spare, charmed Scrub's good sense, showed golden leaf, told cuckoo would bring one every spring. The new cobbler made partner. The greatest people sent shoes mend. Fairfeather smiled kindly him, course summer married, grand wedding feast, whole village danced, except Spare, invited, bride said low-minded, brother thought disgrace family. Indeed, heard story thought Spare must mad, nobody would take lame tinker, beggar boy, poor woman, looked upon witch old ugly. As Scrub, went Fairfeather cottage close new cobbler, quite fine. There mended shoes please everyone, scarlet coat holidays, fat goose dinner every wedding-day. Fairfeather, too, crimson gown fine blue ribbons. But neither Scrub content, buy grand things golden leaf broken parted piece piece, last morsel gone cuckoo came another. Spare lived old hut, worked cabbage garden. (Scrub got barley field, elder.) Every day coat grew ragged, hut weather-beaten, people remarked never looked sad sour. The wonder was, time began keep company, tinker grew kinder ass travelled country, beggar boy kept mischief, old woman never cross cat angry children. Every first April cuckoo came tapping doors golden leaf Scrub green Spare. Fairfeather would treated nobly wheaten bread honey, notion trying make bring two gold leaves instead one. But cuckoo flew away eat barley bread Spare, saying fit company fine people, liked old hut slept snugly Christmas Spring. Scrub spent golden leaves, Spare kept merry ones; I know many years passed manner, great lord, owned village, came dwell near. His castle stood moor. It old strong, high towers deep moat. All country far one could see highest turret belonged lord; twenty years, would come then, sad. The grief Prime Minister Court, high favour, till somebody told Crown Prince spoken great disrespect turning His Royal Highness's toes, King lay taxes enough; whereon north-country lord turned office sent estate. There lived weeks bad temper. The servants said nothing would please him, people village put worst clothes lest raise rents. But one day, harvest time, lordship chanced meet Spare gathering watercresses meadow stream, fell talk cobbler. How nobody could tell, hour great lord cast away sadness. He forgot lost office Court enemies, King's taxes Crown Prince's toes, went noble train, hunting, fishing, making merry hall, travellers well treated poor welcome. This strange story soon spread north country, great company came cobbler's hut--rich men lost money, poor men lost friends, beauties grown old, wits gone fashion--all came talk Spare, whatever troubles been, went home merry. The rich gave presents, poor gave thanks. Spare's coat longer ragged, bacon cabbage, people village began think sense all. By time fame reached chief city kingdom, even Court. There great many discontented people besides King, lately fallen ill humour princess, lived kingdom near own, seven islands dowry, would marry eldest son. So royal page sent Spare, velvet cloak, diamond ring, command come Court once. "To-morrow first April," said Spare, "and I go two hours sunrise." The page lodged night castle, cuckoo came sunrise merry leaf. "The Court fine place," said, cobbler told going. "But I cannot come there, would lay snares catch me. So careful leaves I brought you, give farewell slice barley bread." Spare sorry part cuckoo, little company. But gave slice would broken Scrub's heart former times, large. And sewed leaves lining leather doublet, set page way Court. His coming caused great surprise there. Everybody wondered King could see common-looking man. But hardly His Majesty talked half hour, Princess seven islands forgotten, orders given feast all-comers spread large dining-hall. The princes blood, great lords ladies, Ministers State, judges land talk Spare; talked lighter grew hearts, changes never seen Court. The lords forgot spites ladies envies, princes Ministers made friends among themselves, judges showed favour. As Spare, room set apart palace, seat King's table. One sent rich robes another costly jewels. But midst greatness still wore leathern doublet, palace servants thought mean. One day King's attention drawn chief page, asked Spare give beggar. But cobbler answered: "High mighty King, doublet silk velvet came. I find easier wear Court cut. Moreover, serves keep humble, recalling days holiday dress." The King thought wise speech, gave orders one find fault leathern doublet. So things went on, till news brother's good fortune reached Scrub moorland cottage another first April, cuckoo came two golden leaves none carry Spare. "Think that!" said Fairfeather. "Here spending lives humdrum place, Spare making fortune Court two three paltry green leaves! What would say golden ones? Let us pack make way King's palace. I sure make lord lady honour, speak fine clothes presents shall have." Scrub thought great deal wife said, began pack up. But soon found things cottage fit carrying Court. Fairfeather could think wooden bowls, spoons, plates seen there. Scrub thought lasts awls better left behind, without one would suspect cobbler. So, putting holiday clothes, Fairfeather took looking-glass, Scrub drinking-horn, carrying golden leaf wrapped great care none might see till reached palace, pair set high hopes. How far Scrub Fairfeather journeyed I cannot say; sun high warm noon, came wood tired hungry. "Husband," said Fairfeather, "you mean thoughts. How could one eat barley bread way palace? Let us rest tree, look leaves see safe." In looking leaves, talking going came Court, Scrub Fairfeather see thin old woman slipped behind tree, long staff hand great bag side. "Noble lord lady," said,--"for I know voices, though eyes dim hearing none sharpest,--will tell I may find water mix bottle mead I carry bag, strong me?" As old woman spoke, pulled bag large wooden bottle shepherds used olden times, corked leaves rolled together, small wooden cup hanging handle. "Perhaps favour taste it," said. "It made best honey. I also cream cheese, wheaten loaf here, noble persons eat like." Scrub Fairfeather sure, speech, must something look noble persons have. Besides, hungry; great haste wrapped golden leaves, told old woman proud, notwithstanding lands castles left behind north country, would willingly help lighten bag. The old woman would hardly sit beside them, humble modest, length did; bag half empty, Scrub Fairfeather firmly believed must something noble-looking them. The old woman wood-witch. Her name Buttertongue, time spent making mead, boiled strange herbs spells, power making drank fall asleep dream eyes open. She two dwarfs sons; one named Spy Pounce. Wherever mother went, far behind; whoever tasted mead sure robbed dwarfs. Scrub Fairfeather sat leaning old tree. The cobbler lump cheese hand; wife held fast hunch bread. Their eyes mouths open, dreaming fine things Court, old woman raised shrill voice: "What ho, sons! come here, carry home harvest." No sooner spoken two little dwarfs darted nearest thicket. "Idle boys!" cried mother, "what done to-day help living?" "I city," said Spy, "and could see nothing. These hard times us--everybody minds work contentedly since cobbler came. But leathern doublet page threw window. It use, I brought let see I idle." And tossed Spare's doublet, merry leaves it, carried like bundle little back. To let know Spy got hold it, I must tell forest far great city Spare lived high esteem. All things gone well cobbler till King thought quite unbecoming see worthy man without servant. His Majesty, therefore, let men understand royal favour towards Spare, appointed one pages wait upon him. The name youth Tinseltoes, and, though seventh King's pages rank, nobody Court grander notions. Nothing could please gold silver it, grandmother feared would hang made page cobbler. As Spare, anything could troubled him, mark His Majesty's kindness would done it. The honest man used serve page always way; merry leaves came aid; and, great surprise grandmother, Tinseltoes took new service wonderful way. Some said Spare gave nothing play bowls day palace green. Yet one thing vexed heart Tinseltoes, master's leathern doublet. But it, sure people would never remember Spare cobbler; page took deal pains let see much fashion Court. But Spare answered Tinseltoes done King; last, finding nothing better would do, page got one fine morning earlier master, tossed leathern doublet back window lane, Spy found brought mother. "That nasty thing!" said old woman. "Where good it?" By time, Pounce taken everything value Scrub Fairfeather--the looking-glass, silver-rimmed horn, husband's scarlet coat, wife's gay cloak, and, all, golden leaves, gladdened hearts old Buttertongue sons, threw leathern doublet sleeping cobbler joke, went hut middle forest. The sun going Scrub Fairfeather awoke dreaming made lord lady, sat clothed silk velvet, feasting King palace hall. They greatly disappointed find golden leaves best things gone. Scrub tore hair, vowed take old woman's life, Fairfeather uttered loud cries sorrow. But Scrub, feeling cold want coat, put leathern doublet without asking caring whence came. Hardly buttoned change came him. He began talk merrily, that, instead crying, Fairfeather made wood ring laughter. Both busied getting hut branches, Scrub kindled fire flint steel, which, together pipe, brought unknown Fairfeather, told like never heard Court. Then found pheasant's nest root old oak, made meal roasted eggs, went sleep heap long green grass gathered, nightingales singing night long old trees them. So happened Scrub Fairfeather stayed day day forest, making hut larger cosy winter, living wild birds' eggs, berries, never thinking lost golden leaves, journey Court. In meantime Spare got missed doublet. Tinseltoes, course, said knew nothing it. The whole palace searched, every servant questioned, till Court wondered fuss made old leathern doublet. That day, things came back old fashion. Quarrels began among lords, envies among ladies. The King said people pay half enough taxes, Queen wanted jewels, servants took old quarrels got new ones. Spare found getting strangely dull, much place. Nobles began ask business cobbler King's table, His Majesty ordered palace records searched find thing ever taken place before. The cobbler wise tell lost doublet; time knew Court customs, offered reward fifty gold pieces anyone would bring news it. Scarcely made known city, gates outer courts palace filled men, women, children--some bringing leathern doublets every cut colour, tales heard seen walks round palace. So much news sorts great people came stories, lords ladies ran complain Spare one spoke people. His Majesty, sure example palace records retainer, sent forth decree sending cobbler away ever Court, giving goods page Tinseltoes. That royal decree hardly issued page taken Spare's rich room, costly garments, presents people Court given him. While Spare, longer fifty pieces gold give, glad make escape back window, fear nobles, vowed revenge him, crowd, ready stone cheating doublet. The window Spare let strong rope, Tinseltoes tossed doublet; cobbler came late twilight, poor woodman, heavy load fagots, stopped stared great surprise. "What matter, friend?" asked Spare. "Did never see man coming back window before?" "Why," said woodman, "the last morning I passed here, leathern doublet came window, I feel sure owner it." "That I am, friend," said cobbler eagerly. "Can tell way doublet went?" "As I walked on," said woodman, "a dwarf, called Spy, bundled ran mother forest." "Honest friend," said Spare, taking last fine clothes (a grass-green cloak edged gold), "I give follow dwarf bring back doublet." "It would good carry fagots in," said woodman. "But want back doublet, road forest lies end lane;" trudged away. Having made mind find doublet, sure neither crowd nobles could catch forest, Spare went way, soon among tall trees; neither hut dwarf could see. Moreover, night came on; wood dark thick, moon shone lanes, great owls flitted about, nightingales sang. So went on, hoping find place shelter. At last red light fire, shining thicket, led door low hut. It stood half open, nothing fear, within saw brother Scrub snoring loudly bed grass, foot lay leathern doublet; Fairfeather, dress made plaited rushes, sat roasting pheasants' eggs fire. "Good evening, mistress!" said Spare, stepping in. The blaze shone him, changed brother-in-law Court life, Fairfeather know him, answered far kindly not. "Good evening, master! Whence come late? speak low, good man tired cutting wood, taking sleep, see, supper." "A good rest him!" said Spare, seeing known. "I come Court day's hunting, lost way forest." "Sit share supper," said Fairfeather, "I put eggs ashes; tell news Court--I used think long ago I young foolish." "Did never go there?" said cobbler. "So fair dame would make ladies wonder." "You pleased flatter," said Fairfeather; "but husband brother there, left moorland village try fortune also. An old woman entrance forest, means fair words, got us take strong drink, caused us fall asleep dream great things. But woke, everything robbed us--my looking-glass, scarlet cloak, husband's Sunday coat; and, place all, robbers left old doublet, worn ever since, never merry life, though live poor hut." "It shabby doublet, that," said Spare, taking garment, seeing own, merry leaves still sewed lining. "It would good hunting in, however--your husband would glad part it, I dare say, exchange handsome cloak;" pulled green mantle buttoned doublet, much Fairfeather's delight, ran shook Scrub, crying: "Husband, husband, rise see good bargain I made!" Scrub gave one last snore, muttered something root hard. But rubbed eyes, gazed brother said: "Spare, really you? How like Court, made fortune?" "That I have, brother," said Spare, "in getting back good leathern doublet. Come, let us eat eggs, rest night. In morning return old hut, end moorland village, Christmas Cuckoo come bring us leaves." Scrub Fairfeather agreed. So morning returned, found old hut little worse wear weather. The people village came ask news Court, see made fortune. Everybody surprised find three poorer ever, somehow liked go hut. Spare brought lasts awls hidden corner. Scrub began old trade again, whole north country found never cobblers. They mended shoes lords ladies well common people; everybody well pleased work. Their trade grew greater day day, discontented unlucky came hut old times, Spare went Court. The rich brought presents, poor service. The hut changed, one knew how. Flowering honeysuckle grew roof; red white roses grew thick door. Moreover, Christmas Cuckoo always came first April, bringing three leaves merry tree--for Scrub Fairfeather would golden ones. So I last heard news north country. CHAPTER III LADY GREENSLEEVES On evening next day King Winwealth fell low spirits, gave orders Snowflower wonderful chair brought highest hall. When Snowflower came, laid head chair, saying: "Chair grandmother, tell story." "Listen," said clear voice cushion, "to story Lady Greensleeves." Once upon time lived two noble lords east country. Their lands lay broad river old oak forest. In midst land lord stately castle; one built white freestone, grey granite. So one called Lord White Castle, Lord Grey. No lords east country noble kind they. Their people lived peace plenty; strangers well treated castles. Every autumn sent men axes forest hew great trees, chop firewood poor. Neither hedge ditch divided lands, lords never quarrel. They friends youth. Their ladies died long ago, Lord Grey Castle little son, Lord White little daughter; feasted other's halls custom say, "When children grow marry, castles lands, keep friendship memory." So lords little children, people, lived happily till one Michaelmas night, feasting hall White Castle, came traveller gate, welcomed feasted usual. He seen many strange sights countries, liked tell travels. The lords delighted tales sat round fire supper, length Lord White Castle, always eager know could new countries, said: "Good stranger, greatest wonder ever saw travels?" "The wonderful sight ever I saw," replied traveller, "was end yonder forest, old wooden house sits old woman weaving hair grey cloth old worn-out loom. When wants yarn cuts grey hair, grows quickly though I saw cut morning, door noon. She told wished sell cloth, none came way yet bought any, asked great price. And, way long dangerous wide forest, full bears wolves, rich lord like might buy cloak." All heard story greatly surprised; traveller gone way, Lord White Castle could neither eat sleep wishing see old woman wove hair. At length made mind go forest search old house, told Lord Grey Castle made mind do. Being wise man, lord replied travellers' tales always trusted, tried hard advise undertaking long dangerous journey, went far forest ever returned. However, curious lord would go spite said, vowed go friendship's sake, agreed set without letting anyone know, lest lords land might laugh them. The Lord White Castle steward served many years, name Reckoning Robin. To said: "I going journey friend. Be careful goods, deal justly people, things kind little daughter Loveleaves till return." The steward answered: "Be sure, lord, I will." The Lord Grey Castle also steward served many years, name Wary Will. To said: "I going journey friend. Be careful goods, deal justly people, kind little son Woodwender till return." His steward answered him: "Be sure, lord, I will." So lords kissed children slept, set staff cloak sunrise old oak forest. The children missed fathers, people missed lords. None stewards could tell become them; seven months wore away, come back. The lords thought stewards faithful, served well eyes; instead that, proud cunning, thinking evil happened masters, set lords places. Reckoning Robin son called Hardhold, Wary Will daughter named Drypenny. There sulkier girl boy country, fathers made minds make young lord young lady them; took silk clothes Woodwender Loveleaves used wear, dress them, putting lords' children coarse clothes. Their toys given Hardhold Drypenny; last stewards' children sat chief tables, slept best rooms, Woodwender Loveleaves sent herd swine, sleep straw granary. The poor children one take part. Every morning sunrise sent out--each barley loaf bottle sour milk, serve breakfast, dinner, supper--to watch great herd swine wide field near forest. The grass scanty, swine always straying wood search acorns. The children knew lost wicked stewards would punish them; gathering keeping herds order, readier sleep granary straw night ever within silken curtains. Still, Woodwender Loveleaves great help comfort other, saying fathers would come back God would send friends. So, spite swine-herding hard living, looked cheerful handsome ever; Hardhold Drypenny grew crosser uglier every day, notwithstanding fine clothes. The false stewards like this. They thought children ought look genteel, Woodwender Loveleaves like young swineherds. So sent wilder field, still nearer forest, gave two great black hogs, unruly rest, keep. One hogs belonged Hardhold, Drypenny. Every evening came home stewards' children used come feed them, delight reckon price would bring properly fattened. One hot day, midsummer, Woodwender Loveleaves sat shadow mossy rock. The swine grazed quietly usual; children plaited rushes talked other, till, sun sloping sky, Woodwender saw two great hogs missing. Thinking must gone forest, children ran search them. They heard thrush singing wood-doves calling; saw squirrels leaping branch branch, deer bounding by. But though searched hours, trace hogs could seen. Loveleaves Woodwender dared go home without them. Deeper deeper ran forest, searching calling, vain. And woods began darken fall evening, children feared lost way. It known never feared forest, boars wolves it. But weary, wished place shelter, took green path trees, thinking might lead dwelling hermit forester. A fairer way Woodwender Loveleaves never walked. The grass soft mossy, hedge wild roses honeysuckle grew either side, red light sunset streamed tall trees above. On went, led straight great open dell, covered lovely flowers, bordered banks wild strawberries, overshadowed huge oak, like never seen grove forest. Its branches large full-grown trees. Its trunk wider country church, height like castle. There mossy seats great root, tired children gathered many strawberries cared for, sat one, close small spring bubbled clear crystal. The mighty oak covered thick ivy, thousands birds nests. Woodwender Loveleaves watched flying home parts forest, last saw lady coming path led dell. She wore gown red colour; yellow hair braided bound red band. In right hand carried holly branch; strangest part dress pair long sleeves, green grass. "Who you," said, "that sit late beside well?" And children told story, first lost hogs, way, afraid go home wicked stewards. "Well," said lady, "you fairest swineherds ever came way. Choose whether go home keep hogs Hardhold Drypenny, live free forest me." "We stay you," said children, "for like keeping swine. Besides, fathers went forest, may meet day coming home." While spoke, lady slipped holly branch ivy, key,--soon door opened oak, fair house. The windows rock crystal, could seen without. The walls floors covered thick green moss, soft velvet. There low seats round table, vessels carved wood, hearth inlaid strange stones, oven, storeroom food winter. When stepped in, lady said: "A hundred years I lived here, name Lady Greensleeves. No friend servant I except dwarf Corner, comes end harvest handmill, basket, axe. With grinds nuts, gathers berries, splits firewood; cheerily live winter. But Corner loves frost fears sun; topmost branches begin bud, returns country far north, I lonely summertime." By words children saw welcome were. Lady Greensleeves gave deer's milk cakes nut-flour, soft green moss sleep on. And forgot troubles, wicked stewards, straying swine. Early morning troop came milked, fairies brought flowers, birds brought berries, show Lady Greensleeves bloomed ripened. She taught children make cheese does' milk, wine woodberries. She showed stores honey wild bees made, left hollow trees, rarest plants forest, herbs made creatures tame. All summer Woodwender Loveleaves lived great oak tree, free toil care. The children would happy, could hear news fathers. At last leaves began fade, flowers fall. Lady Greensleeves said Corner coming. One moonlight night heaped sticks fire, set door open, Woodwender Loveleaves going sleep, saying expected friends tell news forest. Loveleaves quite curious father, Lord White Castle, kept awake see would happen, much afraid little girl walked great brown bear. "Good evening, lady!" said bear. "Good evening, bear!" said Lady Greensleeves. "What news part forest?" "Not much," said bear; "only fawns growing cunning--one cannot catch three day." "That bad news," said Lady Greensleeves; walked great wild cat. "Good evening, lady!" said cat. "Good evening, cat!" said Lady Greensleeves. "What news part forest?" "Not much," said cat; "only birds growing plentiful--it worth one's catch them." "That good news," said Lady Greensleeves; flew great black raven. "Good evening, lady!" said raven. "Good evening, raven!" said Lady Greensleeves. "What news part forest?" "Not much," said raven; "only hundred years shall genteel private, trees thick." "How that?" said Lady Greensleeves. "Oh!" said raven, "have heard king forest fairies laid spell two lords, travelling kingdom see old woman weaves hair? They thinned oaks every year, cutting firewood poor. So king met likeness hunter, asked drink oaken goblet, day warm. When two lords drank, forgot lands people, castles children, minded nothing world planting acorns, day night, power spell, heart forest. They never stop till someone makes pause work sun sets, spell broken." "Ah!" said Lady Greensleeves, "he great prince, king forest fairies; worse work world planting acorns." Soon after, bear, cat, raven bade Lady Greensleeves good night. She closed door, put light, went sleep soft moss usual. In morning Loveleaves told Woodwender heard, went Lady Greensleeves milked does, said: "We heard raven told last night, know two lords fathers. Tell us spell may broken." "I fear king forest fairies," said Lady Greensleeves, "because I live alone, friend dwarf Corner. But I tell may do. At end path leads dell turn faces north, find narrow way sprinkled black feathers. Keep path, matter winds, lead straight part forest ravens dwell. There find fathers planting acorns forest trees. Watch till sun near setting, tell wonderful things know make forget work. But sure tell nothing truth, drink nothing running water, fall power fairy king." The children thanked good advice. She packed cakes cheese bag woven grass, soon found narrow way sprinkled black feathers. It long, wound thick trees many circles children often weary, sat rest. When night came, found mossy hollow trunk old tree, laid down, slept summer night--for Woodwender Loveleaves never feared forest. So went, eating cakes cheese hungry, drinking running stream, sleeping hollow trees, till evening seventh day came part forest ravens lived. The tall trees laden nests black ravens. There nothing heard cawing. In great opening oaks grew thinnest, children saw fathers busy planting acorns. Each lord velvet cloak left castle, worn rags rough work forest. Their hair beards grown long; hands soiled earth; old wooden spade, sides lay heaps acorns. The children called names, ran kiss them, saying: "Dear father, come back castle people." But lords replied: "We know castles people. There nothing world oak leaves acorns." Woodwender Loveleaves told former state vain. Nothing would make pause minute. So poor children first sat cried, slept cold grass, sun set, lords worked on. When awoke broad day. Woodwender cheered Loveleaves, saying: "We hungry, two cakes bag, let us share one them--who knows something may happen." So divided cake, ran lords, saying: "Dear fathers, eat us." But lords said: "There use meat drink. Let us plant acorns." Loveleaves Woodwender sat down, ate cake great sorrow. When finished, went stream ran close by, began drink clear water large acorn will. And drank came oaks gay young hunter, mantle green grass; neck hung crystal bugle, hand carried huge oaken goblet, carved flowers leaves, rimmed crystal. Up brim cup filled milk, rich cream floated. And hunter came near, said: "Fair children, leave muddy water, come drink me." But Woodwender Loveleaves answered: "Thanks, good hunter, promised drink nothing running water." Still hunter came nearer goblet, saying: "The water dirty; may swineherds woodcutters, fair children you. Tell me, children mighty kings? Were brought palaces?" But boy girl answered him: "No: brought castles, children yonder lords. Tell us spell upon may broken." At hunter turned angry look, poured milk upon ground, went away empty goblet. Loveleaves Woodwender sorry see rich cream spilled, remembered warning Lady Greensleeves; seeing could better, got withered branch began help lords, scratching ground sharp end, planting acorns. But fathers took notice them, could say. When sun grew warm noon, went drink running stream. Then oaks came another hunter, older first, clothed yellow. About neck hung silver bugle, hand carried oaken goblet, carved leaves fruit, rimmed silver, filled mead brim. This hunter also asked drink, told stream full frogs, asked young prince princess dwelling woods pleasure. But Woodwender Loveleaves answered before: "We promised drink running water, children yonder lords; tell us spell may broken," turned angry look, poured mead, went way. All afternoon children worked beside fathers, planting acorns withered branches. But lords would mind neither words. And evening drew near hungry. So children divided last cake; since could make lords eat them, went banks stream, began eat drink, though hearts heavy. The sun getting low, ravens coming home nests high trees. But one, seemed old weary, alighted near drink stream. As ate, raven lingered, picked small crumbs fell. "Brother," said Loveleaves, "this raven surely hungry. Let us give little bit, though last cake." Woodwender agreed, gave bit raven. But great bill finished morsels moment, hopping nearer, looked face turns. "The poor raven still hungry," said Woodwender, gave another bit. When gobbled, came Loveleaves, gave bit too, till raven eaten whole last cake. "Well," said Woodwender, "at least drink." But stooped water, came oaks another hunter, older last, clothed scarlet. About neck hung golden bugle, hand carried huge oaken goblet, carved ears corn clusters grapes, rimmed gold, filled brim wine. He also said: "Leave muddy water, drink me. It full toads, fit fair children. Surely fairyland, brought queen's palace!" But children said: "We drink nothing water, yonder lords fathers. Tell us spell may broken." And hunter turned angry look, poured wine grass, went way. When gone, old raven looked faces, said: "I eaten last cake, I tell spell may broken. Yonder sun, going behind western trees. Before sets, go lords, tell stewards used you, made herd hogs Hardhold Drypenny. When see listening, catch wooden spades, keep till sun goes down." Woodwender Loveleaves thanked raven, flew never stopped see, running lords began tell bidden. At first lords would listen; children told made sleep straw, sent herd hogs wild pasture, trouble unruly swine, acorn planting grew slower, last lords dropped spades. Then Woodwender, catching father's spade, ran stream threw in. Loveleaves Lord White Castle. That moment sun went behind western oaks, lords stood up, looking, like men awakened, forest, sky, children. So strange story ended, Woodwender Loveleaves went home rejoicing fathers. Each lord returned castle, people merry. The fine toys silk clothes, flower gardens best rooms, taken Hardhold Drypenny, lords' children got again. And wicked stewards, cross boy girl, sent herd swine, live huts wild pasture, everybody said became better. The Lord White Castle never wished see old woman wove hair, Lord Grey Castle continued friend. As Woodwender Loveleaves, met misfortunes, grew up, married, got two castles broad lands fathers. Nor forget lonely Lady Greensleeves, known east country dwarf Corner always came feast Christmas time, midsummer always went live great oak forest. CHAPTER IV CHILDE CHARITY Another evening King Winwealth fell low spirits, sent message Snowflower come highest hall. So little girl went grandmother's chair, upon laid head, saying: "Chair grandmother, tell story." The clear voice cushion said: "Listen story Childe Charity." Once upon time, lived west country little girl neither father mother. They died young, left daughter care uncle, richest farmer country. He houses lands, flocks herds, many servants work house fields, wife brought great dowry, two fair daughters. All neighbours, poor, looked family--insomuch thought great people. The father mother proud peacocks. The daughters thought greatest beauties world, one family would speak civilly anybody thought low. Now happened though near relation, opinion orphan girl, partly fortune, partly humble, kindly nature. It said needy creature was, ready befriend it. So people west country called Childe Charity, name, I never heard it. Childe Charity thought mean proud house. Her uncle would niece. Her cousins would keep company. Her aunt sent work dairy, sleep back garret, kept sorts lumber dry herbs winter. All servants learned lesson, Childe Charity work rest among them. All day scoured pails, scrubbed dishes, washed crockery ware. But every night slept back garret sound princess could palace. Her uncle's house large white, stood among green meadows river's side. In front porch covered vine; behind, farmyard high granaries. Within two parlours rich, two kitchens poor, neighbours thought grand; one day harvest season, rich farmer's corn cut housed, invited harvest supper. The west-country people came holiday clothes. Such heaps cakes cheese, baskets apples barrels ale never feast before. They making merry kitchen parlour, poor old woman came back door, begging scraps food night's lodging. Her clothes coarse ragged; hair scanty grey; back bent; teeth gone. She squinting eye, clubbed foot, crooked fingers. In short, poorest ugliest old woman ever came begging. The first saw kitchen maid, ordered gone ugly witch. The next herd-boy, threw bone. But Childe Charity, hearing noise, came seat foot lowest table, asked old woman take share supper, sleep night bed back garret. The old woman sat without word thanks. All people laughed Childe Charity giving bed supper beggar. Her proud cousins said like mean spirit, Childe Charity mind them. She scraped pots supper night, slept sack among lumber, old woman rested warm bed. And next morning, little girl awoke, gone, without much saying thank you, good morning. That day servants sick feast, mostly cross too--so may judge civil were; when, supper time, come back door old woman, asking broken scraps food night's lodging. No one would listen give morsel, till Childe Charity rose seat foot lowest table, kindly asked take supper, sleep bed back garret. Again old woman sat without word. Childe Charity scraped pots supper, slept sack. In morning old woman gone; six nights after, sure supper spread, back door, little girl always asked in. Childe Charity's aunt said would let get enough beggars. Her cousins made game called genteel visitor. Sometimes old woman said: "Child, make bed softer? blankets thin?" never gave word thanks, civil good morning. At last, ninth night first coming, Childe Charity getting used scrape pots sleep sack, knock came door, stood ugly ashy-coloured dog, stupid-looking clumsy herd-boy would keep him. "Good evening, little girl!" said, Childe Charity opened door. "I supper bed to-night. I going long journey see friend. But dog mine, nobody west country keep me. He little cross, handsome; I leave care till shortest day year. Then I count keeping." When old woman said last word, set speed Childe Charity lost sight minute. The ugly dog began fawn upon her, snarled everybody else. The servants said disgrace house. The cousins wanted drowned, great trouble Childe Charity got leave keep old ruined cow-house. Ugly cross dog was, fawned her, old woman left care. So little girl gave part meals; hard frost came, took back garret, cow-house damp cold long nights. The dog lay quietly straw corner. Childe Charity slept soundly, every morning servants would say her: "What great light fine talking back garret?" "There light moon shining shutterless window, talk I heard," said Childe Charity; thought must dreaming. But night night, awoke dark silent hour comes morning, saw light brighter clearer Christmas fire, heard voices like lords ladies back garret. Partly fear, partly laziness, none servants would rise see might there; till length, winter nights longest, little parlour maid, least work got favour, gathered news mistress, crept bed rest sleeping, set watch small hole door. She saw dog lying quietly corner, Childe Charity sleeping soundly bed, moon shining shutterless window. But hour daybreak came glare lights, sound far-off bugles. The window opened, marched troop little men clothed crimson gold, bearing every man torch, till room looked bright day. They marched great respect dog, lay straw, richly clothed among said: "Royal Prince, prepared banquet hall. What Highness please next?" "You done well," said dog. "Now prepare feast, see things best order; Princess I mean bring stranger never feasted halls before." "Your Highness's commands shall obeyed," said little man, making another bow; company passed window. By another glare lights, sound like far-off flutes. The window opened, came company little ladies clad velvet, carrying crystal lamp. They also walked dog, gayest one said: "Royal Prince, prepared carpets curtains. What Highness please next?" "You done well," said dog. "Now prepare robes, let things best; Princess I bring us stranger never feasted halls before." "Your Highness's commands shall obeyed," said little lady, making low curtsy; company passed window, closed quietly behind them. The dog stretched upon straw, little girl turned sleep, moon shone back garret. The parlour maid much amazed, eager tell story mistress, could close eyes night, cock-crow. But told it, mistress called silly wench foolish dreams, scolded dare speak seen servants. Nevertheless Childe Charity's aunt thought might something worth knowing. So next night, house asleep, crept bed, set watch back garret door. There saw maid told her--the little men torches, little ladies crystal lamps, come dog, words pass, said one, "Now prepare presents," other, "Prepare jewels." When gone, dog stretched straw, Childe Charity turned sleep, moon shone back garret. The mistress could close eyes maid, eager tell story. She woke Childe Charity's rich uncle cock-crow. But heard it, laughed foolish woman, advised repeat like neighbours, lest think lost senses. The mistress could say more, day passed. But night master thought would like see went garret. So house asleep slipped bed, set watch hole door. The thing happened maid mistress saw. The little men crimson torches, little ladies rose-coloured velvet lamps, came window bowed low dog, one saying, "Royal Prince, prepared presents," other, "Royal Prince, prepared jewels." The dog said all: "You done well. To-morrow, come meet Princess horses chariots, let things done best way. For bring stranger house never travelled us, feasted halls before." The little men little ladies said: "Your Highness's commands shall obeyed." When gone window, ugly dog stretched straw, Childe Charity turned sleep, moon shone back garret. The master could close eyes maid mistress. He remembered heard grandfather say, somewhere near meadows lay path leading fairies' country, haymakers used see shining grey summer morning, fairy bands went home. Nobody heard seen like many years; master thought doings back garret must fairy business, ugly dog person great account. His chief wonder was, however, visitor fairies intended take house; thinking matter over, sure must one daughters--they handsome, fine clothes. So Childe Charity's rich uncle made first business morning get ready breakfast roast mutton ugly dog, carry cow-house. But morsel would dog taste. "The fairies strange ways," said master himself. But called daughters bade dress best, could say might called great company nightfall. Childe Charity's cousins, hearing this, put richest silks laces, strutted like peacocks kitchen parlour day. They bad humour night fell, nobody come. But family sitting supper ugly dog began bark, old woman's knock heard back door. Childe Charity opened it, going offer bed supper usual, old woman said: "This shortest day year, I going home hold feast travels. I see taken good care dog, come house, I best entertain you. Here company." As old woman spoke sound far-off flutes bugles, glare lights. And great company, clad grandly shone gold jewels, came open chariots, covered gilding drawn snow-white horses. The first finest chariots empty. The old woman led Childe Charity hand, ugly dog jumped her. The proud cousins, finery, time come door, nobody wanted them. No sooner old woman dog within chariot wonderful change passed them, ugly old woman turned beautiful young princess, long yellow curls robe green gold; ugly dog side started fair young prince, nut-brown hair robe purple silver. "We are," said they, chariots drove on, "a prince princess Fairyland, wager us whether good people still found false greedy times. One said 'Yes', said 'No'." "And I lost," said Prince, "and must pay feast presents." Childe Charity never heard story. Some farmer's household, looking them, said chariots gone one way across meadows, said gone another, till day cannot agree upon way went. But Childe Charity went noble company country never seen--for primroses covered ground, light always like summer evening. They took royal palace, nothing feasting dancing seven days. She robes pale green velvet wear, slept room inlaid ivory. When feast done, Prince Princess gave heaps gold jewels could carry them; gave chariot go home in, drawn six white horses. On seventh night, happened Christmas time, farmer's family settled minds would never come back, sitting supper, heard sound coachman's bugle, saw alight jewels gold back door brought ugly old woman. The fairy chariot drove away, never came back farmhouse after. But Childe Charity scoured scrubbed more, grew great lady, even eyes proud cousins. CHAPTER V SOUR AND CIVIL Once King Winwealth wished hear story told wonderful chair, orders given Snowflower bring King's hall. She brought chair laid head cushion, saying: "Chair grandmother, tell story." The voice cushion said: "Listen story Sour Civil." Once upon time stood upon seacoast west country small village low cottages, one lived fishermen. All round broad beach snow-white sand, nothing seen gulls seabirds, long tangled seaweeds cast tide came went night day, summer winter. There harbour port shore. Ships passed distance, white sails set, land side lay wide grassy downs, peasants lived shepherds fed flocks. There families never wanted plenty herrings mackerel; spare landsmen bought village markets downs, giving exchange butter, cheese, corn. The two best fishermen village sons two old widows, children, happened near neighbours. Their family names short, called one Sour Civil. They related one another far I ever heard. But one boat, always fished together, though names expressed difference natures--for Civil never used hard word soft one would do, Sour snarling somebody, sure grumbling everything. Nevertheless agreed well, lucky fishers. Both strong, active, good courage. On winter's night summer's morning would steer sea far beyond boats neighbours, never came home without fish cook spare. Their mothers proud them, way--for saying held good, "Like mother, like son". Dame Civil thought whole world hold better son; boy creature Dame Sour scold frown. The village divided opinion young fishermen. Some thought Civil better; said, without Sour would catch nothing. So things went on, till one day fall winter, mists gathering darkly sea sky, air chill frosty, boat-men hamlet went fish, Sour Civil. That day usual luck. Cast nets would, single fish came in. Their neighbours caught boatfuls, went home, Sour said, laughing them. But sea growing crimson sunset, nets empty, tired. Civil like go home without fish--it would hurt high opinion formed village. Besides, sea calm evening fair, and, last attempt, steered still farther out, cast nets beside rock rose rough grey water, called Merman's Seat--from old report fishermen's fathers seen mermen, sea-people, sitting moonlight nights. Nobody believed rumour now, villagers like fish there. The water said deep, sudden squalls apt trouble it. But Sour Civil right glad see moving lines something net, gladder still found heavy strength required draw up. Scarcely landed Merman's Seat, joy changed sorrow, besides starved mackerel, net held nothing huge ugly fish long Civil (who taller Sour), large snout, long beard, skin covered prickles. "Such horrid ugly creature!" said Sour, shook net rough rock, gathered mackerel. "We need fish more. How mock us village staying late, bringing home little!" "Let us try again," said Civil, set creel mackerel boat. "Not another cast I make to-night;" Sour would said, cut short great fish, for, looking round them, spoke out: "I suppose think worth taking home dirty boat; I tell country, neither would thought fit keep company." Sour Civil much surprised hear fish speak. The first could think cross word say, Civil made answer usual way. "Indeed, lord, beg pardon, boat light carry fish you." "You well call lord," said fish, "for I am, though hard expect could known great I dress. However, help rock, I must go home; civil way speaking I give daughter marriage, come see day twelvemonth." Civil helped great fish rock great respect fear would allow him. Sour frightened whole business, said word till got safe home. But day forward, wanted put Civil down, custom tell mother would get wife ugly fish's daughter. Old Dame Sour heard story son, told whole village. Some people wondered, part laughed good joke; Civil mother never known angry day. Dame Civil advised son never fish Sour again; Civil got old skiff one fishermen going break firewood, cobbled himself. In skiff went sea winter, summer. But though Civil brave skilful, could catch little, boat bad--and everybody mother began think value. Sour good boat, got new comrade, praise best fisherman. Poor Civil's heart getting low summer wore away. The fish grown scarce coast, fishermen steer farther sea. One evening toiled day caught nothing, Civil thought would go farther too, try fortune beside Merman's rock. The sea calm evening fair. Civil remember day troubles began great fish talking twelve months before. As neared rock sun setting, much surprised fisherman see upon three fair ladies, sea-green gowns strings great pearls wound round long fair hair. Two waving hands him. They tallest stately ladies ever seen. But Civil could perceive came nearer colour cheeks, hair strange bluish shade, like deep sea-water, fiery look eyes frightened him. The third, tall, notice all, kept eyes fixed setting sun. Though look full sadness, Civil could see faint rosy bloom cheek, hair golden yellow, eyes mild clear like mother. "Welcome! welcome! noble fisherman!" cried two ladies. "Our father sent us visit him." With one bound leaped boat, bringing smaller lady, said: "Oh! bright sun brave sky I see seldom!" But Civil heard more, boat went miles deep sea, thought drowning. But one lady caught right arm, left, pulled mouth rocky cave, still down, steep hillside. The cave long, grew wider came bottom. Then Civil saw faint light, walked fair company country sea-people. In land grew neither grass flowers, bushes trees, ground covered bright-coloured shells pebbles. There hills marble, rocks spar. Over cold blue sky sun, light clear silvery harvest moon. The fisherman could see smoking chimneys, caves rocks spar, halls marble hills, lived sea-people--with whom, old stories say, fishermen sailors used meet lonely capes headlands simple times world. Forth came parts see stranger. Mermen long white beards, mermaids walk fishermen, clad sea-green decked strings pearls; every one colourless face, wild light eyes. The mermaids led Civil one marble hills great cavern halls rooms like palace. Their floors white marble, walls red granite, roofs inlaid coral. Thousands crystal lamps lit palace. There seats tables hewn shining spar, great company sat feasting. But amazed Civil number cups, flagons, goblets, made gold silver, different shapes patterns seemed gathered countries world. In chief hall sat merman stately chair, jewels rest him. Before mermaids brought Civil, saying: "Father, guest." "Welcome, noble fisherman!" cried merman, voice Civil remembered terror, great ugly fish; "welcome halls! Sit feast us, choose daughters bride." Civil never felt greatly frightened life. How get home mother? would old dame think dark night came without bringing home? There use talking--Civil wisdom enough see that. He therefore tried take things quietly; and, thanked merman kindly inviting him, took seat set apart right hand. Civil hungry long day sea, want fare table; meats wines, never tasted, set richest golden dishes, but, hungry was, fisherman felt everything taste smell sea. If fisherman lord lands castles would treated respect. The two mermaids sat him--one filled plate, another filled goblet; third looked hidden, warning way nobody saw her. Civil soon finished share feast, merman showed fine things cavern. The halls full company, feasting, dancing, playing kinds games, every hall large number gold silver vessels. But Civil surprised merman brought marble room full heaps precious stones. There diamonds whose value fisherman knew not--pearls larger ever diver gathered--emeralds rubies, would made jewellers world wonder. The merman said: "This eldest daughter's dowry." "Good luck attend her!" said Civil. "It dowry queen." But merman led another room. It filled heaps gold coin, seemed gathered times nations. The images kings ever reigned there. The merman said: "This second daughter's dowry." "Good luck attend her!" said Civil. "It dowry princess." "So may say," replied merman. "But make mind maidens marry, third portion all, daughter; only, may see, poor silly girl taken family charity." "Truly, lord," said Civil, whose mind already made up, "both daughters rich far noble me; therefore I choose third. Since poor best poor fisherman." "If choose her," said merman, "you must wait long wedding. I cannot allow girl lower estate married daughters." And said great deal persuade him. But Civil would change mind, returned hall. There attention fisherman, everybody watched well. Turn would, master guest eyes upon him, though made best speeches could remember, praised splendid things. One thing, however, strange--there end fun feasting. Nobody seemed tired, nobody thought sleep. When Civil's eyes closed weariness, slept one marble benches--no matter many hours--there company feasting dancing away; thousand lamps within, cold moonlight without. Civil wished back mother, net, cobbled skiff. Fishing would easier everlasting feasts; nothing else among sea-people--no night rest, working day. Civil knew time went on, till, waking long sleep, saw, first time, feast over, company gone. The lamps still burned, tables, riches, stood empty halls; face seen, sound heard, low voice singing beside outer door. And there, sitting alone, found mild-eyed maiden. "Fair lady," said Civil, "tell means quietness, merry company?" "You man land," said lady, "and know sea-people. They never sleep year, Christmas time. Then go deep caverns, always darkness, sleep till new year comes." "It strange habit," said Civil; "but folks way. Fair lady, I good friends, tell me, whence come wines meats, gold silver vessels, seeing neither cornfields flocks here, workmen?" "The sea-people heirs sea," replied maiden; "to come stores riches lost it. I know ways come; lord halls keeps keys seven gates, go in. But one gates, open thrice seven years, leads path sea, which, I heard merman say cups, one might reach land. "Good fisherman," went on, "if chance gain favour, ever open gate, let bear company; I born sun shines grass grows, though country parents unknown me. All I remember sailing great ship, storm arose, wrecked, one soul escaped drowning me. I little child, brave sailor bound floating plank washed away. Here sea-people came round like great fishes, I went rich weary country. Sometimes, great favour, take see sun; seldom, never like part one seen country; and, fisherman, ever leave them, remember take nothing belongs them, pebble, give power yours." "Thanks news, fair lady," said Civil. "A lord's daughter, doubtless, must been, I poor fisherman. Yet, fallen misfortune, let us friends, may shall find means get back sunshine together." "You man good manners," said lady, "therefore I shall gladly friend; fear shall never see sunshine again." "Fair speeches brought here," said Civil, "and fair speeches may help back, sure I go without you." This promise cheered lady's heart, Civil spent Christmas time seeing wonders sea country. They wandered caves like great merman. The feast left spread every hall; tables covered costly vessels; heaps jewels lay floors unlocked rooms. But lady's warning, Civil would liked put away mother. The poor woman sad heart time, believing son drowned. On first night come home, gone sea watched till morning. Then fishermen steered again, Sour found skiff floating about, brought home, saying foolish young man doubt lost; better could expected discreet person take care him? This vexed Dame Civil sore. She never expected see son again; but, feeling lonely cottage evening hour used come home, good woman got habit going sunset sitting beside sea. That winter happened mild coast west country, one evening Christmas time near, rest village preparing make merry, Dame Civil sat, usual, sands. The tide ebbing sun going down, eastward came lady clad black, mounted black horse, followed squire sad clothing. As lady came near, said: "Woe daughter, I lost sea!" "You say well, noble lady," said Dame Civil. "Woe also son, I none beside him." When lady heard that, alighted horse, sat fisherman's mother, saying: "Listen story. I widow great lord heart east country. He left fair castle, daughter, joy heart. Her name Faith Feignless. But, yet child, great fortune-teller told daughter would marry fisherman. I thought would great disgrace noble family, therefore sent daughter nurse good ship, bound far-away city relations live, intending follow soon I could get lands castles sold. "But ship wrecked," lady went on, "and daughter drowned; I wandered world good Squire Trusty, mourning every shore lost friends sea. Some I mourned grew forget sorrow, would lament more. Others sour selfish, mocked me, saying, grief nothing them. But good manners, I remain you, however humble dwelling. My squire carries gold enough pay I need." So mourning lady good Squire Trusty went home Dame Civil, longer lonely sorrow, dame said: "Oh! son alive, I never let go sea cobbled skiff!" lady answered: "Oh! daughter living, I never think disgrace though married fisherman!" The Christmas passed always west country--shepherds made merry downs, fishermen shore. But merrymakings ringing bells land, sea-people woke feasts dances. Like one forgotten past, merman showed Civil room gold room jewels, advising choose two daughters. But fisherman still answered ladies noble, far rich him. Yet looked glittering heap, Civil could help remembering poor people west country, thought slipped out, "How happy old neighbours would find here!" "Say so?" said merman, always wanted visitors. "Yes," said Civil, "I neighbours yonder west country, would hard send home got sight half wealth." And honest fisherman thought Dame Sour son. The merman greatly pleased speeches--he thought chance getting many land-people down, said Civil, "Suppose took jewels, went tell poor neighbours welcome might make them?" The hope getting back country made Civil's heart glad, promised go without lady, therefore answered prudently indeed true. "Many thanks, lord," said, "for choosing humble man I carry message. But people west country never believe anything without two witnesses least. Yet poor maid I chosen could allowed go me, I think would believe us both." The merman said nothing reply; people, heard Civil's speech, talked among till grew sure whole west country would come down, news riches, asked lord send Civil poor maid order let know. As seemed public good, great merman agreed. But, made mind back, gathered rich rooms largest pearls diamonds, said: "Take present me, let west-country people see I visitors." Civil lady took presents, saying: "Oh, lord, kind. We want nothing pleasure telling wonderful riches yonder." "Tell everybody come down, get like," said merman; "and follow eldest daughter, carries key land gate." Civil lady followed mermaid winding gallery, led chief hall far marble hill. All dark, neither lamp torch, end gallery came great stone gate, creaked like thunder hinges. Beyond narrow cave, sloping like steep hillside. Civil lady thought would never reach top. But last saw gleam daylight, strip blue sky, mermaid bade stoop creep seemed narrow crack ground, stood broad seabeach day breaking tide ebbing fast away. "Good times among west-country people," said mermaid. "Tell would like come visit us, must come midway high low watermark, tide going morning evening. Call thrice sea-people, show way." Before could make answer, sunk sight, track passage there, covered loose sand seashells. "Now," said lady Civil, "we seen heavens more, go back. Cast merman's present quickly sun rises." Taking bag pearls diamonds, flung far could sea. Civil never unwilling part anything bag, thought better lady done, tossed sea also. They thought heard long moan come waters; Civil saw mother's chimney beginning smoke, fair lady sea-green gown hastened good dame's cottage. The whole village awakened morning cries "Welcome back, son!" "Welcome back, daughter!" mournful lady knew lost daughter, Faith Feignless, fisherman brought back, neighbours gathered together hear story. When told, everybody praised Civil prudence shown, except Sour mother. They nothing rail upon losing great chances making whole country rich. At last, heard merman's riches, neither mother son would stay longer west country; nobody persuaded them, would Civil told them, Sour got boat steered away mother toward Merman's rock. From voyage never came back hamlet. Some say went lived among sea-people. Others say--I know learned it--that Sour mother grumbled growled much even sea-people grew weary them, turned boat open sea. What part world chose land nobody sure of. By accounts seen everywhere, I surprised good company. As Civil married Faith Feignless, became great lord. CHAPTER VI PRINCE WISEWIT'S RETURN King Winwealth pleased stories told wonderful chair gave Snowflower many presents, among golden girdle, promised longer go low company, feast nobles chief hall, sleep one best rooms palace. Snowflower delighted promise feasting noble lords ladies, whose wonderful stories heard chair. She bowed low, thanked King Winwealth bottom heart. All company glad make room her, golden girdle put on, little Snowflower looked fine best them. "Mamma," whispered Princess Greedalind, looked ready cry spite, "only see low little girl came coarse frock barefooted, finery favour gained story-telling chair! All Court praising overlooking me, though feast made honour birthday. Mamma, I must chair her. What business common little girl anything amusing?" "So shall, daughter," said Queen Wantall--for time saw King Winwealth had, according custom, fallen asleep throne. So calling two pages, Screw Hardhands, ordered bring chair end hall Snowflower sat, made present Princess Greedalind. Nobody Court ever thought disputing Queen Wantall's commands, poor Snowflower sat corner cry. While Princess Greedalind, putting thought grand air, laid head cushion, saying: "Chair grandmother, tell story." "Where get grandmother?" cried clear voice cushion. And went chair force throw Princess Greedalind floor, lay screaming, good deal angry hurt. All Court tried vain comfort her. But Queen Wantall, whose temper still worse, vowed would punish impudent thing, sent Sturdy, chief woodman, chop axe. At first stroke cushion cut open, surprise everybody bird, whose snow-white feathers tipped purple, darted out, flew away open window. "Catch it! catch it!" cried Queen Princess; King Winwealth, still slept throne, rushed bird. It flew palace garden wild common, houses Queen Wantall pulled search gold mine, Her Majesty never found, though three deep pits dug come it. To make place look smart feast time, pits covered loose branches turf. All rest company remembered Queen Wantall Princess Greedalind. They nearest bird, poor Snowflower, running hard, came close behind them, Fairfortune, one King's pages, drew back purple mantle, when, coming covered pit, branches turf gave way, went Queen Princess. Everybody looked bird, nowhere seen. But common people saw alight, stood fair royal Prince, clad robe purple crown changing colours, sometimes seemed gold sometimes forest leaves. Most people stood knowing think, fairy people lords ladies chair's stories, knew him, cried: "Welcome Prince Wisewit!" King Winwealth heard sound slept, came glad heart welcome back brother. When pages came ropes lanterns search Queen Wantall Princess Greedalind, found safe well bottom pit, fallen heap loose sand. The pit great depth, daylight shone down, whatever yellow grains saw glittering among sand, Queen Princess believed full gold. They called miners false knaves, lazy rogues, score bad names beside, leaving much wealth behind them, utterly refused come pit; saying, since Prince Wisewit come, could find pleasure palace, would stay dig gold, buy world themselves. King Winwealth thought plan good one keeping peace palace. He commanded shovels picks lowered Queen Princess. The two pages, Screw Hardhands, went help them, hopes halving profits; stayed, digging gold. Some people Court said would find it. Others believed never could, gold found story written. As Prince Wisewit, went home rest company, leading Snowflower hand, telling turned bird cunning fairy Fortunetta, found guard forest; shut cushion curious chair, given old Dame Frostyface; comfort little Snowflower, told many stories. King Winwealth rejoiced find brother again, commanded another feast held many days. All time gates palace stood open; all-comers welcome, complaints heard. The houses lands Queen Wantall taken away, given back rightful owners. Everybody got wanted most. There noises strife without, discontents within palace; last day feast arrive Dame Frostyface, grey hood cloak. Snowflower right glad see grandmother--so King Prince, known Dame youth. They kept feast days more; ended everything right kingdom. King Winwealth Prince Wisewit reigned together; Snowflower best girl country, chose heiress, instead Princess Greedalind. From day forward wore white velvet satin; seven pages, lived grandest part palace. Dame Frostyface, too, made great lady. They put new velvet cushion chair, sat gown grey cloth, edged gold, spinning ivory wheel fine painted parlour. Prince Wisewit built great summer-house covered vines roses, spot old cottage stood. He also made highway forest, good people might come go leisure; cunning fairy Fortunetta, finding reign parts, set journey round world, return time story. Good boys girls, may chance read it, time long ago. Great wars, work, learning passed world since then, changed fashions. Kings make seven-day feasts all-comers now. Queens princesses, however greedy, mine gold. Chairs tell tales. Wells work wonders; doings hills forests, fairies dance more. Some say hum schools--some think din factories frightened them. But nobody seen many year, except, said, one Hans Christian Andersen, Denmark, whose tales fairies good must heard themselves. It certain living man knows later history King Winwealth's country, became people lived visited palace. Yet people believe King still falls asleep throne low spirits evening; Queen Wantall Princess Greedalind found gold, begun buy; Dame Frostyface yet spins--they cannot tell where; Snowflower may still seen new year's time dress white velvet, looking early spring; Prince Wisewit somehow fallen stronger spell thicker cushion, still tells stories Snowflower friends, cushion spell broken another stroke Sturdy's hatchet--which expect happen time--the Prince make things right again, bring back fairy times world.
