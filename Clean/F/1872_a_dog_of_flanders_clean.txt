 A DOG OF FLANDERS Nello Patrasche left alone world. They friends friendship closer brotherhood. Nello little Ardennois--Patrasche big Fleming. They age length years, yet one still young, already old. They dwelt together almost days: orphaned destitute, owed lives hand. It beginning tie them, first bond sympathy; strengthened day day, grown growth, firm indissoluble, loved one another greatly. Their home little hut edge little village--a Flemish village league Antwerp, set amidst flat breadths pasture corn-lands, long lines poplars alders bending breeze edge great canal ran it. It score houses homesteads, shutters bright green sky-blue, roofs rose-red black white, walls white-washed shone sun like snow. In centre village stood windmill, placed little moss-grown slope: landmark level country round. It painted scarlet, sails all, infancy, half century earlier, ground wheat soldiers Napoleon; ruddy brown, tanned wind weather. It went queerly fits starts, though rheumatic stiff joints age, served whole neighborhood, would thought almost impious carry grain elsewhere attend religious service mass performed altar little old gray church, conical steeple, stood opposite it, whose single bell rang morning, noon, night strange, subdued, hollow sadness every bell hangs Low Countries seems gain integral part melody. Within sound little melancholy clock almost birth upward, dwelt together, Nello Patrasche, little hut edge village, cathedral spire Antwerp rising north-east, beyond great green plain seeding grass spreading corn stretched away like tideless, changeless sea. It hut old man, poor man--of old Jehan Daas, time soldier, remembered wars trampled country oxen tread furrows, brought service nothing except wound, made cripple. When old Jehan Daas reached full eighty, daughter died Ardennes, hard Stavelot, left legacy two-year-old son. The old man could ill contrive support himself, took additional burden uncomplainingly, soon became welcome precious him. Little Nello---which pet diminutive Nicolas--throve him, old man little child lived poor little hut contentedly. It humble little mud-hut indeed, clean white sea-she will, stood small plot garden-ground yielded beans herbs pumpkins. They poor, terribly poor--many day nothing eat. They never chance enough: enough eat would reached paradise once. But old man gentle good boy, boy beautiful, innocent, truthful, tender-hearted creature; happy crust leaves cabbage, asked earth heaven; save indeed Patrasche always them, since without Patrasche would been? For Patrasche alpha omega; treasury granary; store gold wand wealth; bread-winner minister; friend comforter. Patrasche dead gone them, must laid died likewise. Patrasche body, brains, hands, head, feet them: Patrasche life, soul. For Jehan Daas old cripple, Nello child; Patrasche dog. A dog Flanders--yellow hide, large head limb, wolf-like ears stood erect, legs bowed feet widened muscular development wrought breed many generations hard service. Patrasche came race toiled hard cruelly sire son Flanders many century--slaves slaves, dogs people, beasts shafts harness, creatures lived straining sinews gall cart, died breaking hearts flints streets. Patrasche born parents labored hard days sharp-set stones various cities long, shadowless, weary roads two Flanders Brabant. He born heritage pain toil. He fed curses baptized blows. Why not? It Christian country, Patrasche dog. Before fully grown known bitter gall cart collar. Before entered thirteenth month become property hardware-dealer, accustomed wander land north south, blue sea green mountains. They sold small price, young. This man drunkard brute. The life Patrasche life hell. To deal tortures hell animal creation way Christians showing belief it. His purchaser sullen, ill-living, brutal Brabantois, heaped cart full pots pans flagons buckets, wares crockery brass tin, left Patrasche draw load best might, whilst lounged idly side fat sluggish ease, smoking black pipe stopping every wineshop caf√© road. Happily Patrasche--or unhappily--he strong: came iron race, long born bred cruel travail; die, managed drag wretched existence brutal burdens, scarifying lashes, hunger, thirst, blows, curses, exhaustion wages Flemings repay patient laborious four-footed victims. One day, two years long deadly agony, Patrasche going usual along one straight, dusty, unlovely roads lead city Rubens. It full midsummer, warm. His cart heavy, piled high goods metal earthenware. His owner sauntered without noticing otherwise crack whip curled round quivering loins. The Brabantois paused drink beer every wayside house, forbidden Patrasche stop moment draught canal. Going along thus, full sun, scorching highway, eaten nothing twenty-four hours, and, far worse him, tasted water near twelve, blind dust, sore blows, stupefied merciless weight dragged upon loins, Patrasche staggered foamed little mouth, fell. He fell middle white, dusty road, full glare sun; sick unto death, motionless. His master gave medicine pharmacy--kicks oaths blows cudgel oak, often food drink, wage reward, ever offered him. But Patrasche beyond reach torture curses. Patrasche lay, dead appearances, white powder summer dust. After while, finding useless assail ribs punishment ears maledictions, Brabantois--deeming life gone him, going nearly carcass forever useless, unless indeed one strip skin gloves--cursed fiercely farewell, struck leathern bands harness, kicked body aside grass, and, groaning muttering savage wrath, pushed cart lazily along road up-hill, left dying dog ants sting crows pick. It last day Kermesse away Louvain, Brabantois haste reach fair get good place truck brass wares. He fierce wrath, Patrasche strong much-enduring animal, hard task pushing charette way Louvain. But stay look Patrasche never entered thoughts: beast dying useless, would steal, replace him, first large dog found wandering alone sight master. Patrasche cost nothing, next nothing, two long, cruel years made toil ceaselessly service sunrise sunset, summer winter, fair weather foul. He got fair use good profit Patrasche: human, wise, left dog draw last breath alone ditch, bloodshot eyes plucked might birds, whilst went way beg steal, eat drink, dance sing, mirth Louvain. A dying dog, dog cart--why waste hours agonies peril losing handful copper coins, peril shout laughter? Patrasche lay there, flung grass-green ditch. It busy road day, hundreds people, foot mules, wagons carts, went by, tramping quickly joyously Louvain. Some saw him, even look: passed on. A dead dog less--it nothing Brabant: would nothing anywhere world. After time, among holiday-makers, came little old man bent lame, feeble. He guise feasting: poorly miserably clad, dragged silent way slowly dust among pleasure-seekers. He looked Patrasche, paused, wondered, turned aside, kneeled rank grass weeds ditch, surveyed dog kindly eyes pity. There little rosy, fair-haired, dark-eyed child years old, pattered amidst bushes, breast-high, stood gazing pretty seriousness upon poor, great, quiet beast. Thus two first met--the little Nello big Patrasche. The upshot day was, old Jehan Daas, much laborious effort, drew sufferer homeward little hut, stone's throw amidst fields, tended much care sickness, brain seizure, brought heat thirst exhaustion, time shade rest passed away, health strength returned, Patrasche staggered upon four stout, tawny legs. Now many weeks useless, powerless, sore, near death; time heard rough word, felt harsh touch, pitying murmurs child's voice soothing caress old man's hand. In sickness grown care him, lonely man little happy child. He corner hut, heap dry grass bed; learned listen eagerly breathing dark night, tell lived; first well enough essay loud, hollow, broken bay, laughed aloud, almost wept together joy sign sure restoration; little Nello, delighted glee, hung round rugged neck chains marguerites, kissed fresh ruddy lips. So then, Patrasche arose, again, strong, big, gaunt, powerful, great wistful eyes gentle astonishment curses rouse blows drive him; heart awakened mighty love, never wavered fidelity whilst life abode him. But Patrasche, dog, grateful. Patrasche lay pondering long grave, tender, musing brown eyes, watching movements friends. Now, old soldier, Jehan Daas, could nothing living limp little small cart, carried daily milk-cans happier neighbors owned cattle away town Antwerp. The villagers gave employment little charity--more suited well send milk town honest carrier, bide home look gardens, cows, poultry, little fields. But becoming hard work old man. He eighty-three, Antwerp good league off, more. Patrasche watched milk-cans come go one day got well lying sun wreath marguerites round tawny neck. The next morning, Patrasche, old man touched cart, arose walked placed betwixt handles, testified plainly dumb show could desire ability work return bread charity eaten. Jehan Daas resisted long, old man one thought foul shame bind dogs labor Nature never formed them. But Patrasche would gainsaid: finding harness him, tried draw cart onward teeth. At length Jehan Daas gave way, vanquished persistence gratitude creature succored. He fashioned cart Patrasche could run it, every morning life thenceforward. When winter came, Jehan Daas thanked blessed fortune brought dying dog ditch fair-day Louvain; old, grew feebler year, would ill known pull load milk-cans snows deep ruts mud strength industry animal befriended. As Patrasche, seemed heaven him. After frightful burdens old master compelled strain under, call whip every step, seemed nothing amusement step little light green cart, bright brass cans, side gentle old man always paid tender caress kindly word. Besides, work three four day, time free would--to stretch himself, sleep sun, wander fields, romp young child, play fellow-dogs. Patrasche happy. Fortunately peace, former owner killed drunken brawl Kermesse Mechlin, sought disturbed new well-loved home. A years later, old Jehan Daas, always cripple, became paralyzed rheumatism impossible go cart more. Then little Nello, grown sixth year age, knowing town well accompanied grandfather many times, took place beside cart, sold milk received coins exchange, brought back respective owners pretty grace seriousness charmed beheld him. The little Ardennois beautiful child, dark, grave, tender eyes, lovely bloom upon face, fair locks clustered throat; many artist sketched group went him--the green cart brass flagons Teniers Mieris Van Tal, great tawny-colored, massive dog, belled harness chimed cheerily went, small figure ran beside little white feet great wooden shoes, soft, grave, innocent, happy face like little fair children Rubens. Nello Patrasche work well joyfully together Jehan Daas himself, summer came better again, need stir out, could sit doorway sun see go forth garden wicket, doze dream pray little, awake clock tolled three watch return. And return Patrasche would shake free harness bay glee, Nello would recount pride doings day; would go together meal rye bread milk soup, would see shadows lengthen great plain, see twilight veil fair cathedral spire; lie together sleep peacefully old man said prayer. So days years went on, lives Nello Patrasche happy, innocent, healthful. In spring summer especially glad. Flanders lovely land, around burgh Rubens perhaps least lovely all. Corn colza, pasture plough, succeed characterless plain wearying repetition, save gaunt gray tower, peal pathetic bells, figure coming athwart fields, made picturesque gleaner's bundle woodman's fagot, change, variety, beauty anywhere; dwelt upon mountains amidst forests feels oppressed imprisonment tedium endlessness vast dreary level. But green fertile, wide horizons certain charm even dulness monotony; among rushes water-side flowers grow, trees rise tall fresh barges glide great hulks black sun, little green barrels vari-colored flags gay leaves. Anyway, greenery breadth space enough good beauty child dog; two asked better, work done, lie buried lush grasses side canal, watch cumbrous vessels drifting bring crisp salt smell sea among blossoming scents country summer. True, winter harder, rise darkness bitter cold, seldom much could eaten day, hut scarce better would nights cold, although looked pretty warm weather, buried great kindly clambering vine, never bore fruit, indeed, covered luxuriant green tracery months blossom harvest. In winter winds found many holes walls poor little hut, vine black leafless, bare lands looked bleak drear without, sometimes within floor flooded frozen. In winter hard, snow numbed little white limbs Nello, icicles cut brave, untiring feet Patrasche. But even never heard lament, either them. The child's wooden shoes dog's four legs would trot manfully together frozen fields chime bells harness; sometimes, streets Antwerp, housewife would bring bowl soup handful bread, kindly trader would throw billets fuel little cart went homeward, woman village would bid keep share milk carried food; would run white lands, early darkness, bright happy, burst shout joy home. So, whole, well them, well; Patrasche, meeting highway public streets many dogs toiled daybreak nightfall, paid blows curses, loosened shafts kick starve freeze best might--Patrasche heart grateful fate, thought fairest kindliest world could hold. Though often hungry indeed lay night; though work heats summer noons rasping chills winter dawns; though feet often tender wounds sharp edges jagged pavement; though perform tasks beyond strength nature--yet grateful content: duty day, eyes loved smiled him. It sufficient Patrasche. There one thing caused Patrasche uneasiness life, this. Antwerp, world knows, full every turn old piles stones, dark ancient majestic, standing crooked courts, jammed gateways taverns, rising water's edge, bells ringing air, ever arched doors swell music pealing. There remain, grand old sanctuaries past, shut amidst squalor, hurry, crowds, unloveliness, commerce modern world, day long clouds drift birds circle winds sigh around them, beneath earth feet sleeps--RUBENS. And greatness mighty Master still rests upon Antwerp, wherever turn narrow streets glory lies therein, mean things thereby transfigured; pace slowly winding ways, edge stagnant water, noisome courts, spirit abides us, heroic beauty visions us, stones felt footsteps bore shadow seem arise speak living voices. For city tomb Rubens still lives us him, alone. It quiet great white sepulchre--so quiet, save organ peals choir cries aloud Salve Regina Kyrie Eleison. Sure artist ever greater gravestone pure marble sanctuary gives heart birthplace chancel St. Jacques. Without Rubens, Antwerp? A dirty, dusky, bustling mart, man would ever care look upon save traders business wharves. With Rubens, whole world men sacred name, sacred soil, Bethlehem god Art saw light, Golgotha god Art lies dead. O nations! closely treasure great men, alone future know you. Flanders generations wise. In life glorified greatest sons, death magnifies name. But wisdom rare. Now, trouble Patrasche this. Into great, sad piles stones, reared melancholy majesty crowded roofs, child Nello would many many time enter, disappear dark arched portals, whilst Patrasche, left without upon pavement, would wearily vainly ponder could charm thus allured inseparable beloved companion. Once twice essay see himself, clattering steps milk-cart behind him; thereon always sent back summarily tall custodian black clothes silver chains office; fearful bringing little master trouble, desisted, remained couched patiently churches time boy reappeared. It fact going disturbed Patrasche: knew people went church: village went small, tumbledown, gray pile opposite red windmill. What troubled little Nello always looked strangely came out, always flushed pale; whenever returned home visitations would sit silent dreaming, caring play, gazing evening skies beyond line canal, subdued almost sad. What it? wondered Patrasche. He thought could good natural little lad grave, dumb fashion tried could keep Nello sunny fields busy market-place. But churches Nello would go: often would go great cathedral; Patrasche, left without stones iron fragments Quentin Matsys's gate, would stretch yawn sigh, even howl then, vain, doors closed child perforce came forth again, winding arms dog's neck would kiss broad, tawney-colored forehead, murmur always words: "If I could see them, Patrasche!--if I could see them!" What they? pondered Patrasche, looking large, wistful, sympathetic eyes. One day, custodian way doors left ajar, got moment little friend saw. "They" two great covered pictures either side choir. Nello kneeling, rapt ecstasy, altar-picture Assumption, noticed Patrasche, rose drew dog gently air, face wet tears, looked veiled places passed them, murmured companion, "It terrible see them, Patrasche, one poor cannot pay! He never meant poor see painted them, I sure. He would us see day, every day: I sure. And keep shrouded there--shrouded dark, beautiful things!--and never feel light, eyes look them, unless rich people come pay. If I could see them, I would content die." But could see them, Patrasche could help him, gain silver piece church exacts price looking glories Elevation Cross Descent Cross thing utterly beyond powers either would scale heights cathedral spire. They never much sou spare: cleared enough get little wood stove, little broth pot, utmost could do. And yet heart child set sore endless longing upon beholding greatness two veiled Rubens. The whole soul little Ardennois thrilled stirred absorbing passion Art. Going ways old city early days sun people risen, Nello, looked little peasant-boy, great dog drawing milk sell door door, heaven dreams whereof Rubens god. Nello, cold hungry, stockingless feet wooden shoes, winter winds blowing among curls lifting poor thin garments, rapture meditation, wherein saw beautiful fair face Mary Assumption, waves golden hair lying upon shoulders, light eternal sun shining upon brow. Nello, reared poverty, buffeted fortune, untaught letters, unheeded men, compensation curse called Genius. No one knew it. He little any. No one knew it. Only indeed Patrasche, who, always, saw draw chalk upon stones every thing grew breathed, heard little bed hay murmur manner timid, pathetic prayers spirit great Master; watched gaze darken face radiate evening glow sunset rosy rising dawn; felt many many time tears strange, nameless pain joy, mingled together, fall hotly bright young eyes upon wrinkled yellow forehead. "I go grave quite content I thought, Nello, thou growest man thou couldst hut little plot ground, labor thyself, called Baas thy neighbors," said old man Jehan many hour bed. For bit soil, called Baas--master--by hamlet round, achieved highest ideal Flemish peasant; old soldier, wandered earth youth, brought nothing back, deemed old age live die one spot contented humility fairest fate could desire darling. But Nello said nothing. The leaven working times begat Rubens Jordaens Van Eycks, wondrous tribe, times recent begat green country Ardennes, Meuse washes old walls Dijon, great artist Patroclus, whose genius near us us aright measure divinity. Nello dreamed things future tilling little rood earth, living wattle roof, called Baas neighbors little poorer little less poor himself. The cathedral spire, rose beyond fields ruddy evening skies dim, gray, misty mornings, said things this. But told Patrasche, whispering, childlike, fancies dog's ear went together work fogs daybreak, lay together rest among rustling rushes water's side. For dreams easily shaped speech awake slow sympathies human auditors; would sorely perplexed troubled poor old man bedridden corner, who, part, whenever trodden streets Antwerp, thought daub blue red called Madonna, walls wine-shop drank sou's worth black beer, quite good famous altar-pieces stranger folk travelled far wide Flanders every land good sun shone. There one beside Patrasche Nello could talk daring fantasies. This little Alois, lived old red mill grassy mound, whose father, miller, best-to-do husbandman village. Little Alois pretty baby soft round, rosy features, made lovely sweet dark eyes Spanish rule left many Flemish face, testimony Alvan dominion, Spanish art left broadsown throughout country majestic palaces stately courts, gilded house-fronts sculptured lintels--histories blazonry poems stone. Little Alois often Nello Patrasche. They played fields, ran snow, gathered daisies bilberries, went old gray church together, often sat together broad wood-fire mill-house. Little Alois, indeed, richest child hamlet. She neither brother sister; blue serge dress never hole it; Kermesse many gilded nuts Agni Dei sugar hands could hold; went first communion flaxen curls covered cap richest Mechlin lace, mother's grandmother's came her. Men spoke already, though twelve years, good wife would sons woo win; little gay, simple child, nowise conscious heritage, loved playfellows well Jehan Daas's grandson dog. One day father, Baas Cogez, good man, somewhat stern, came pretty group long meadow behind mill, aftermath day cut. It little daughter sitting amidst hay, great tawny head Patrasche lap, many wreaths poppies blue corn-flowers round both: clean smooth slab pine wood boy Nello drew likeness stick charcoal. The miller stood looked portrait tears eyes, strangely like, loved child closely well. Then roughly chid little girl idling whilst mother needed within, sent indoors crying afraid: then, turning, snatched wood Nello's hands. "Dost much folly?" asked, tremble voice. Nello colored hung head. "I draw everything I see," murmured. The miller silent: stretched hand franc it. "It folly, I say, evil waste time: nevertheless, like Alois, please house-mother. Take silver bit leave me." The color died face young Ardennois; lifted head put hands behind back. "Keep money portrait both, Baas Cogez," said, simply. "You often good me." Then called Patrasche him, walked away across field. "I could seen franc," murmured Patrasche, "but I could sell picture--not even them." Baas Cogez went mill-house sore troubled mind. "That lad must much Alois," said wife night. "Trouble may come hereafter: fifteen now, twelve; boy comely face form." "And good lad loyal," said housewife, feasting eyes piece pine wood throned chimney cuckoo clock oak Calvary wax. "Yea, I gainsay that," said miller, draining pewter flagon. "Then, think ever come pass," said wife, hesitatingly, "would matter much? She enough both, one cannot better happy." "You woman, therefore fool," said miller, harshly, striking pipe table. "The lad naught beggar, and, painter's fancies, worse beggar. Have care together future, I send child surer keeping nuns Sacred Heart." The poor mother terrified, promised humbly will. Not could bring altogether separate child favorite playmate, miller even desire extreme cruelty young lad guilty nothing except poverty. But many ways little Alois kept away chosen companion; Nello, boy proud quiet sensitive, quickly wounded, ceased turn steps Patrasche, used every moment leisure, old red mill upon slope. What offence know: supposed manner angered Baas Cogez taking portrait Alois meadow; child loved would run nestle hand his, would smile sadly say tender concern himself, "Nay, Alois, anger father. He thinks I make idle, dear, pleased me. He good man loves well: anger him, Alois." But sad heart said it, earth look bright used went sunrise poplars straight roads Patrasche. The old red mill landmark him, used pause it, going coming, cheery greeting people little flaxen head rose low mill-wicket, little rosy hands held bone crust Patrasche. Now dog looked wistfully closed door, boy went without pausing, pang heart, child sat within tears dropping slowly knitting set little stool stove; Baas Cogez, working among sacks mill-gear, would harden say himself, "It best so. The lad beggar, full idle, dreaming fooleries. Who knows mischief might come future?" So wise generation, would door unbarred, except upon rare formal occasion, seemed neither warmth mirth two children, accustomed long daily gleeful, careless, happy interchange greeting, speech, pastime, watcher sports auditor fancies Patrasche, sagely shaking brazen bells collar responding dog's swift sympathies every change mood. All little panel pine wood remained chimney mill-kitchen cuckoo clock waxen Calvary, sometimes seemed Nello little hard whilst gift accepted denied. But complain: habit quiet: old Jehan Daas said ever him, "We poor: must take God sends--the ill good: poor cannot choose." To boy always listened silence, reverent old grandfather; nevertheless certain vague, sweet hope, beguiles children genius, whispered heart, "Yet poor choose sometimes--choose great, men cannot say nay." And thought still innocence; one day, little Alois, finding chance alone among cornfields canal, ran held close, sobbed piteously morrow would saint's day, first time life parents failed bid little supper romp great barns feast-day always celebrated, Nello kissed murmured firm faith, "It shall different one day, Alois. One day little bit pine wood father mine shall worth weight silver; shut door then. Only love always, dear little Alois, love always, I great." "And I love you?" pretty child asked, pouting little tears, moved instinctive coquetries sex. Nello's eyes left face wandered distance, red gold Flemish night cathedral spire rose. There smile face sweet yet sad little Alois awed it. "I great still," said breath--"great still, die, Alois." "You love me," said little spoilt child, pushing away; boy shook head smiled, went way tall yellow corn, seeing vision day fair future come old familiar land ask Alois people, refused denied, received honor, whilst village folk throng look upon say one another's ears, "Dost see him? He king among men, great artist world speaks name; yet poor little Nello, beggar one may say, got bread help dog." And thought would fold grandsire furs purples, portray old man portrayed Family chapel St. Jacques; would hang throat Patrasche collar gold, place right hand, say people, "This friend;" would build great white marble palace, make luxuriant gardens pleasure, slope looking outward cathedral spire rose, dwell himself, summon it, home, men young poor friendless, mighty things; would say always, sought bless name, "Nay, thank me--thank Rubens. Without him, I been?" And dreams, beautiful, impossible, innocent, free selfishness, full heroical worship, closely went happy--happy even sad anniversary Alois's saint's day, Patrasche went home little dark hut meal black bread, whilst mill-house children village sang laughed, ate big round cakes Dijon almond gingerbread Brabant, danced great barn light stars music flute fiddle. "Never mind, Patrasche," said, arms round dog's neck sat door hut, sounds mirth mill came night air--"never mind. It shall changed by." He believed future: Patrasche, experience philosophy, thought loss mill supper present ill compensated dreams milk honey vague hereafter. And Patrasche growled whenever passed Baas Cogez. "This Alois's name-day, not?" said old man Daas night corner stretched upon bed sacking. The boy gave gesture assent: wished old man's memory erred little, instead keeping sure account. "And there?" grandfather pursued. "Thou hast never missed year before, Nello." "Thou art sick leave," murmured lad, bending handsome head bed. "Tut! tut! Mother Nulette would come sat me, scores times. What because, Nello?" old man persisted. "Thou surely hast ill words little one?" "Nay, grandfather--never," said boy quickly, hot color bent face. "Simply truly, Baas Cogez asked year. He taken whim me." "But thou hast done nothing wrong?" "That I know--nothing. I took portrait Alois piece pine: all." "Ah!" The old man silent: truth suggested boy's innocent answer. He tied bed dried leaves corner wattle hut, wholly forgotten ways world like. He drew Nello's fair head fondly breast tenderer gesture. "Thou art poor, child," said quiver aged, trembling voice--"so poor! It hard thee." "Nay, I rich," murmured Nello; innocence thought so--rich imperishable powers mightier might kings. And went stood door hut quiet autumn night, watched stars troop tall poplars bend shiver wind. All casements mill-house lighted, every notes flute came him. The tears fell cheeks, child, yet smiled, said himself, "In future!" He stayed quite still dark, Patrasche went within slept together, long deeply, side side. Now secret Patrasche knew. There little out-house hut, one entered himself--a dreary place, abundant clear light north. Here fashioned rudely easel rough lumber, great gray sea stretched paper given shape one innumerable fancies possessed brain. No one ever taught anything; colors means buy; gone without bread many time procure even rude vehicles here; black white could fashion things saw. This great figure drawn chalk old man sitting fallen tree--only that. He seen old Michel woodman sitting evening many time. He never soul tell outline perspective, anatomy shadow, yet given weary, worn-out age, sad, quiet patience, rugged, careworn pathos original, given old lonely figure poem, sitting there, meditative alone, dead tree, darkness descending night behind him. It rude, course, way, many faults, doubt; yet real, true nature, true art, mournful, manner beautiful. Patrasche lain quiet countless hours watching gradual creation labor day done, knew Nello hope--vain wild perhaps, strongly cherished--of sending great drawing compete prize two hundred francs year announced Antwerp would open every lad talent, scholar peasant, eighteen, would attempt win unaided work chalk pencil. Three foremost artists town Rubens judges elect victor according merits. All spring summer autumn Nello work upon treasure, which, triumphant, would build first step toward independence mysteries art blindly, ignorantly, yet passionately adored. He said nothing one: grandfather would understood, little Alois lost him. Only Patrasche told all, whispered, "Rubens would give me, I think, knew." Patrasche thought too, knew Rubens loved dogs never painted exquisite fidelity; men loved dogs were, Patrasche knew, always pitiful. The drawings go first day December, decision given twenty-fourth, win might rejoice people Christmas season. In twilight bitter wintry day, beating heart, quick hope, faint fear, Nello placed great picture little green milk-cart, took it, help Patrasche, town, left it, enjoined, doors public building. "Perhaps worth nothing all. How I tell?" thought, heart-sickness great timidity. Now left there, seemed hazardous, vain, foolish, dream he, little lad bare feet, barely knew letters, could anything great painters, real artists, could ever deign look. Yet took heart went cathedral: lordly form Rubens seemed rise fog darkness, loom magnificence him, whilst lips, kindly smile, seemed murmur, "Nay, courage! It weak heart faint fears I wrote name time upon Antwerp." Nello ran home cold night, comforted. He done best: rest must God willed, thought, innocent, unquestioning faith taught little gray chapel among willows poplar-trees. The winter sharp already. That night, reached hut, snow fell; fell many days that, paths divisions fields obliterated, smaller streams frozen over, cold intense upon plains. Then, indeed, became hard work go round milk world dark, carry darkness silent town. Hard work, especially Patrasche, passage years, bringing Nello stronger youth, bringing old age, joints stiff bones ached often. But would never give share labor. Nello would fain spared drawn cart himself, Patrasche would allow it. All would ever permit accept help thrust behind truck lumbered along ice-ruts. Patrasche lived harness, proud it. He suffered great deal sometimes frost, terrible roads, rheumatic pains limbs, drew breath hard bent stout neck, trod onward steady patience. "Rest thee home, Patrasche--it time thou didst rest--and I quite well push cart myself," urged Nello many morning; Patrasche, understood aright, would consented stay home veteran soldier shirk charge sounding; every day would rise place shafts, plod along snow fields four round feet left print upon many, many years. "One must never rest till one dies," thought Patrasche; sometimes seemed time rest far off. His sight less clear been, gave pain rise night's sleep, though would never lie moment straw bell chapel tolling five let know daybreak labor begun. "My poor Patrasche, shall soon lie quiet together, I," said old Jehan Daas, stretching stroke head Patrasche old withered hand always shared one poor crust bread; hearts old man old dog ached together one thought: When gone, would care darling? One afternoon, came back Antwerp snow, become hard smooth marble Flemish plains, found dropped road pretty little puppet, tambourine--player, scarlet gold, six inches high, and, unlike greater personages Fortune let us drop, quite unspoiled unhurt fall. It pretty toy. Nello tried find owner, and, failing, thought thing please Alois. It quite night passed mill-house: knew little window room. It could harm, thought, gave little piece treasure-trove, playfellows long. There would sloping roof beneath casement: climbed tapped softly lattice: little light within. The child opened looked half frightened. Nello put tambourine-player hands. "Here doll I found snow, Alois. Take it," whispered--"take it, God bless thee, dear!" He slid would-roof time thank him, ran darkness. That night fire mill. Outbuildings much corn destroyed, although mill dwelling-house unharmed. All village terror, engines came tearing snow Antwerp. The miller insured, would lose nothing: nevertheless, furious wrath, declared aloud fire due accident, foul intent. Nello, awakened sleep, ran help rest: Baas Cogez thrust angrily aside. "Thou wert loitering dark," said roughly. "I believe, soul, thou dost know fire one." Nello heard silence, stupefied, supposing one could say things except jest, comprehending one could pass jest time. Nevertheless, miller said brutal thing openly many neighbors day followed; though serious charge ever preferred lad, got bruited Nello seen mill-yard dark unspoken errand, bore Baas Cogez grudge forbidding intercourse little Alois; hamlet, followed sayings richest landowner servilely, whose families hoped secure riches Alois future time sons, took hint give grave looks cold words old Jehan Daas's grandson. No one said anything openly, village agreed together humor miller's prejudice, cottages farms Nello Patrasche called every morning milk Antwerp, downcast glances brief phrases replaced broad smiles cheerful greetings always used. No one really credited miller's absurd suspicion, outrageous accusations born them, people poor ignorant, one rich man place pronounced him. Nello, innocence friendlessness, strength stem popular tide. "Thou art cruel lad," miller's wife dared say, weeping, lord. "Sure innocent lad faithful, would never dream wickedness, however sore heart might be." But Baas Cogez obstinate man, said thing held doggedly, though innermost soul knew well injustice committing. Meanwhile, Nello endured injury done certain proud patience disdained complain: gave way little quite alone old Patrasche. Besides, thought, "If win! They sorry then, perhaps." Still, boy quite sixteen, dwelt one little world short life, childhood caressed applauded sides, hard trial whole little world turn naught. Especially hard bleak, snow-bound, famine-stricken winter-time, light warmth could found abode beside village hearths kindly greetings neighbors. In winter-time drew nearer other, all, except Nello Patrasche, none would anything do, left fare might old paralyzed, bedridden man little cabin, whose fire often low, whose board often without bread, buyer Antwerp taken drive mule day milk various dairies, three four people refused terms purchase remained faithful little green cart. So burden Patrasche drew become light, centime-pieces Nello's pouch become, alas! small likewise. The dog would stop, usual, familiar gates, closed him, look wistful, mute appeal; cost neighbors pang shut doors hearts, let Patrasche draw cart again, empty. Nevertheless, it, desired please Baas Cogez. No√´l close hand. The weather wild cold. The snow six feet deep, ice firm enough bear oxen men upon everywhere. At season little village always gay cheerful. At poorest dwelling possets cakes, joking dancing, sugared saints gilded J√©sus. The merry Flemish bells jingled everywhere horses; everywhere within doors well-filled soup-pot sang smoked stove; everywhere snow without laughing maidens pattered bright kerchiefs stout kirtles, going mass. Only little hut dark cold. Nello Patrasche left utterly alone, one night week Christmas Day, Death entered there, took away life forever old Jehan Daas, never known life aught save poverty pains. He long half dead, incapable movement except feeble gesture, powerless anything beyond gentle word; yet loss fell great horror it: mourned passionately. He passed away sleep, gray dawn learned bereavement, unutterable solitude desolation seemed close around them. He long poor, feeble, paralyzed old man, could raise hand defence, loved well: smile always welcomed return. They mourned unceasingly, refusing comforted, white winter day followed deal held body nameless grave little gray church. They mourners, two left friendless upon earth--the young boy old dog. "Surely, relent let poor lad come hither?" thought miller's wife, glancing husband smoking hearth. Baas Cogez knew thought, hardened heart, would unbar door little, humble funeral went by. "The boy beggar," said himself: "he shall Alois." The woman dared say anything aloud, grave closed mourners gone, put wreath immortelles Alois's hands bade go lay reverently dark, unmarked mound snow displaced. Nello Patrasche went home broken hearts. But even poor, melancholy, cheerless home denied consolation. There month's rent over-due little home, Nello paid last sad service dead coin left. He went begged grace owner hut, cobbler went every Sunday night drink pint wine smoke Baas Cogez. The cobbler would grant mercy. He harsh, miserly man, loved money. He claimed default rent every stick stone, every pot pan, hut, bade Nello Patrasche morrow. Now, cabin lowly enough, sense miserable enough, yet hearts clove great affection. They happy there, summer, clambering vine flowering beans, pretty bright midst sunlighted fields! There life full labor privation, yet well content, gay heart, running together meet old man's never-failing smile welcome! All night long boy dog sat fireless hearth darkness, drawn close together warmth sorrow. Their bodies insensible cold, hearts seemed frozen them. When morning broke white, chill earth morning Christmas Eve. With shudder, Nello clasped close friend, tears fell hot fast dog's frank forehead. "Let us go, Patrasche--dear, dear Patrasche," murmured. "We wait kicked out: let us go." Patrasche his, went sadly, side side, little place dear both, every humble, homely thing precious beloved. Patrasche drooped head wearily passed green cart: longer his--it go rest pay rent, brass harness lay idle glittering snow. The dog could lain beside died heart-sickness went, whilst lad lived needed Patrasche would yield give way. They took old accustomed road Antwerp. The day yet scarce dawned, shutters still closed, villagers about. They took notice whilst dog boy passed them. At one door Nello paused looked wistfully within: grandfather done many kindly turn neighbor's service people dwelt there. "Would give Patrasche crust?" said, timidly. "He old, nothing since last forenoon." The woman shut door hastily, murmuring vague saying wheat rye dear season. The boy dog went wearily: asked more. By slow painful ways reached Antwerp chimes tolled ten. "If I anything I could sell get bread!" thought Nello, nothing except wisp linen serge covered him, pair wooden shoes. Patrasche understood, nestled nose lad's hand, though pray disquieted woe want his. The winner drawing-prize proclaimed noon, public building left treasure Nello made way. On steps entrance-hall crowd youths--some age, older, parents relatives friends. His heart sick fear went among them, holding Patrasche close him. The great bells city clashed hour noon brazen clamor. The doors inner hall opened; eager, panting throng rushed in: known selected picture would raised rest upon wooden dais.. A mist obscured Nello's sight, head swam, limbs almost failed him. When vision cleared saw drawing raised high: own! A slow, sonorous voice proclaiming aloud victory adjudged Stephen Kiesslinger, born burgh Antwerp, son wharfinger town. When Nello recovered consciousness lying stones without, Patrasche trying every art knew call back life. In distance throng youths Antwerp shouting around successful comrade, escorting acclamations home upon quay. The boy staggered feet drew dog embrace. "It over, dear Patrasche," murmured--"all over!" He rallied best could, weak fasting, retraced steps village. Patrasche paced side head drooping old limbs feeble hunger sorrow. The snow falling fast: keen hurricane blew north: bitter death plains. It took long traverse familiar path, bells sounding four clock approached hamlet. Suddenly Patrasche paused, arrested scent snow, scratched, whined, drew teeth small case brown leather. He held Nello darkness. Where stood little Calvary, lamp burned dully cross: boy mechanically turned case light: name Baas Cogez, within notes two thousand francs. The sight roused lad little stupor. He thrust shirt, stroked Patrasche drew onward. The dog looked wistfully face. Nello made straight mill-house, went house-door struck panels. The miller's wife opened weeping, little Alois clinging close skirts. "Is thee, thou poor lad?" said kindly tears. "Get thee gone ere Baas see thee. We sore trouble to-night. He seeking power money let fall riding homeward, snow never find it; God knows go nigh ruin us. It Heaven's judgment things done thee." Nello put note-case hand called Patrasche within house. "Patrasche found money to-night," said quickly. "Tell Baas Cogez so: I think deny dog shelter food old age. Keep pursuing me, I pray good him." Ere either woman dog knew meant stooped kissed Patrasche: closed door hurriedly, disappeared gloom fast--falling night. The woman child stood speechless joy fear: Patrasche vainly spent fury anguish iron-bound oak barred house-door. They dare unbar door let forth: tried could solace him. They brought sweet cakes juicy meats; tempted best had; tried lure abide warmth hearth; avail. Patrasche refused comforted stir barred portal. It six clock opposite entrance miller last came, jaded broken, wife's presence. "It lost forever," said, ashen cheek quiver stern voice. "We looked lanterns everywhere: gone--the little maiden's portion all!" His wife put money hand, told come her. The strong man sank trembling seat covered face, ashamed almost afraid. "I cruel lad," muttered length: "I deserved good hands." Little Alois, taking courage, crept close father nestled fair curly head. "Nello may come again, father?" whispered. "He may come to-morrow used do?" The miller pressed arms: hard, sunburned face pale mouth trembled. "Surely, surely," answered child. "He shall bide Christmas Day, day will. God helping me, I make amends boy--I make amends." Little Alois kissed gratitude joy, slid knees ran dog kept watch door. "And to-night I may feast Patrasche?" cried child's thoughtless glee. Her father bent head gravely: "Ay, ay: let dog best;" stern old man moved shaken heart's depths. It Christmas Eve, mill-house filled oak logs squares turf, cream honey, meat bread, rafters hung wreaths evergreen, Calvary cuckoo clock looked mass holly. There little paper lanterns, too, Alois, toys various fashions sweetmeats bright-pictured papers. There light warmth abundance everywhere, child would fain made dog guest honored feasted. But Patrasche would neither lie warmth share cheer. Famished cold, without Nello would partake neither comfort food. Against temptation proof, close door leaned always, watching means escape. "He wants lad," said Baas Cogez. "Good dog! good dog! I go lad first thing day-dawn." For one Patrasche knew Nello left hut, one Patrasche divined Nello gone face starvation misery alone. The mill-kitchen warm: great logs crackled flamed hearth; neighbors came glass wine slice fat goose baking supper. Alois, gleeful sure playmate back morrow, bounded sang tossed back yellow hair. Baas Cogez, fulness heart, smiled moistened eyes, spoke way would befriend favorite companion; house-mother sat calm, contented face spinning-wheel; cuckoo clock chirped mirthful hours. Amidst Patrasche bidden thousand words welcome tarry cherished guest. But neither peace plenty could allure Nello not. When supper smoked board, voices loudest gladdest, Christ-child brought choicest gifts Alois, Patrasche, watching always occasion, glided door unlatched careless new-comer, swiftly weak tired limbs would bear sped snow bitter, black night. He one thought--to follow Nello. A human friend might paused pleasant meal, cheery warmth, cosey slumber; friendship Patrasche. He remembered bygone time, old man little child found sick unto death wayside ditch. Snow fallen freshly evening long; nearly ten; trail boy's footsteps almost obliterated. It took Patrasche long discover scent. When last found it, lost quickly, lost recovered, lost recovered, hundred times more. The night wild. The lamps wayside crosses blown out; roads sheets ice; impenetrable darkness hid every trace habitations; living thing abroad. All cattle housed, huts homesteads men women rejoiced feasted. There Patrasche cruel cold--old famished full pain, strength patience great love sustain search. The trail Nello's steps, faint obscure new snow, went straightly along accustomed tracks Antwerp. It past midnight Patrasche traced boundaries town narrow, tortuous, gloomy streets. It quite dark town, save light gleamed ruddily crevices house-shutters, group went homeward lanterns chanting drinking-songs. The streets white ice: high walls roofs loomed black them. There scarce sound save riot winds passages tossed creaking signs shook tall lamp-irons. So many passers-by trodden snow, many diverse paths crossed recrossed other, dog hard task retain hold track followed. But kept way, though cold pierced bone, jagged ice cut feet, hunger body gnawed like rat's teeth. He kept way, poor gaunt, shivering thing, long patience traced steps loved heart burgh steps great cathedral. "He gone things loved," thought Patrasche: could understand, full sorrow pity art-passion incomprehensible yet sacred. The portals cathedral unclosed midnight mass. Some heedlessness custodians, eager go home feast sleep, drowsy know whether turned keys aright, left one doors unlocked. By accident foot-falls Patrasche sought passed building, leaving white marks snow upon dark stone floor. By slender white thread, frozen fell, guided intense silence, immensity vaulted space--guided straight gates chancel, and, stretched upon stones, found Nello. He crept touched face boy. "Didst thou dream I faithless forsake thee? I--a dog?" said mute caress. The lad raised low cry clasped close. "Let us lie die together," murmured. "Men need us, alone." In answer, Patrasche crept closer yet, laid head upon young boy's breast. The great tears stood brown, sad eyes: himself--for happy. They lay close together piercing cold. The blasts blew Flemish dikes northern seas like waves ice, froze every living thing touched. The interior immense vault stone even bitterly chill snow-covered plains without. Now bat moved shadows--now gleam light came ranks carven figures. Under Rubens lay together quite still, soothed almost dreaming slumber numbing narcotic cold. Together dreamed old glad days chased flowering grasses summer meadows, sat hidden tall bulrushes water's side, watching boats go seaward sun. Suddenly darkness great white radiance streamed vastness aisles; moon, height, broken clouds, snow ceased fall, light reflected snow without clear light dawn. It fell arches full upon two pictures above, boy entrance flung back veil: Elevation Descent Cross one instant visible. Nello rose feet stretched arms them; tears passionate ecstasy glistened paleness face. "I seen last!" cried aloud. "O God, enough!" His limbs failed him, sank upon knees, still gazing upward majesty adored. For brief moments light illumined divine visions denied long--light clear sweet strong though streamed throne Heaven. Then suddenly passed away: great darkness covered face Christ. The arms boy drew close body dog. "We shall see His face--_there,_" murmured; "and He part us, I think." On morrow, chancel cathedral, people Antwerp found both. They dead: cold night frozen stillness alike young life old. When Christmas morning broke priests came temple, saw lying thus stones together. Above veils drawn back great visions Rubens, fresh rays sunrise touched thorn-crowned head Christ. As day grew came old, hard-featured man wept women weep. "I cruel lad," muttered, "and I would made amends--yea, half substance--and son." There came also, day grew apace, painter fame world, liberal hand spirit. "I seek one prize yesterday worth won," said people--"a boy rare promise genius. An old wood-cutter fallen tree eventide--that theme. But greatness future it. I would fain find him, take teach Art." And little child curling fair hair, sobbing bitterly clung father's arm, cried aloud, "Oh, Nello, come! We ready thee. The Christ-child's hands full gifts, old piper play us; mother says thou shalt stay hearth burn nuts us No√´l week long--yes, even Feast Kings! And Patrasche happy! Oh, Nello, wake come!" But young pale face, turned upward light great Rubens smile upon mouth, answered all, "It late." For sweet, sonorous bells went ringing frost, sunlight shone upon plains snow, populace trooped gay glad streets, Nello Patrasche asked charity hands. All needed Antwerp gave unbidden. Death pitiful longer life would been. It taken one loyalty love, innocence faith, world love recompense faith fulfilment. All lives together, deaths divided: found arms boy folded closely around dog severed without violence, people little village, contrite ashamed, implored special grace them, and, making one grave, laid rest side side--forever!
