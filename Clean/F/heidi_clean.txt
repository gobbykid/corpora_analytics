Where footpath begins go steeply abruptly Alps, heath, short grass pungent herbage, sends soft perfume meet wayfarer. One bright sunny morning June, tall, vigorous maiden mountain region climbed narrow path, leading little girl hand. The youngster's cheeks glow showed even sun-browned skin. Small wonder though! spite heat, little one, scarcely five years old, bundled brave bitter frost. Her shape difficult distinguish, wore two dresses, three, around shoulders large red cotton shawl. With feet encased heavy hob-nailed boots, hot shapeless little person toiled mountain. The pair climbing hour reached hamlet half-way great mountain named Alm. This hamlet called "I Am Dörfli" "The Little Village." It elder girl's home town, therefore greeted nearly every house; people called windows doors, often road. But, answering questions calls went by, girl loiter way stood still reached end hamlet. There cottages lay scattered about, furthest voice called open door: "Deta, please wait one moment! I coming you, going up." When girl stood still wait, child instantly let go hand promptly sat ground. "Are tired, Heidi?" Deta asked child. "No, hot," replied. "We shall hour, take big steps climb little might!" Thus elder girl tried encourage small companion. A stout, pleasant-looking woman stepped house joined two. The child risen wandered behind old acquaintances, immediately started gossiping friends neighborhood people hamlet generally. "Where taking child, Deta?" asked newcomer. "Is child sister left?" "Yes," Deta assured her; "I taking Alm-Uncle I want remain." "You cannot really mean take Deta. You must lost senses, go him. I sure old man show door even listen say." "Why not?

He speak living soul, one year's end keeps away church. People get way appears twelve-month among us. We fear really like heathen old Indian, thick grey eyebrows huge uncanny beard. When wanders along road twisted stick afraid meet alone." "That fault," said Deta stubbornly. "He harm; should, responsible, I." "I wish I knew weighs old man's conscience. Why eyes fierce live alone? Nobody ever sees hear many strange things him. Did sister tell anything, Deta?" "Of course did, I shall hold tongue. He would make pay I not." Barbara long anxious know something old uncle lived apart everybody. Nobody good word him, people talked him, speak openly afraid. She could even explain called Alm-Uncle. He could possibly uncle people village, since everybody spoke so, same. Barbara, lived village since marriage, glad get information friend. Deta bred there, since mother's death gone away earn livelihood. She confidentially seized Deta's arm said: "I wish would tell truth him, Deta; know all--people gossip. Tell me, happened old man turn everybody so? Did always hate fellow-creatures?" "I cannot tell whether always did, good reason. He sixty years old, I twenty-six, cannot expect give account early youth. But promise keep set people Prätiggan talking, I tell good deal. My mother came Domleschg." "How talk like that, Deta?" replied Barbara offended tone. "People gossip much Prätiggan, I always keep things myself, I to. You repent told me, I assure you!" "All right, keep word!" said Deta warningly. Then looked around see child close overhear might said; little girl nowhere seen. While two young women talked rate, noticed absence; quite must elapsed since little girl given following companions. Deta, standing still, looked everywhere, one path, which--except curves--was visible far village. "There is! Cannot see there?" exclaimed Barbara, pointing spot good distance path. "She climbing goatherd Peter goats. I wonder late to-day. I must say, suits us well enough; look child tell everything without interrupted." "It easy Peter watch her," remarked Deta; "she bright five years keeps eyes wide open. I often noticed I glad her, useful uncle. He nothing left whole wide world, cottage two goats!" "Did more?" asked Barbara. "I say so. He heir large farm Domleschg. But setting play fine gentleman, soon lost everything drink play. His parents died grief disappeared parts. After many years came back half-grown boy, son, Tobias, name, became carpenter turned quiet, steady fellow. Many strange rumors went round uncle I think left Domleschg Dörfli. We acknowledged relationship, mother's grandmother cousin his. We called uncle, related father's side nearly people hamlet called uncle. He named 'Alm-Uncle' moved Alm." "But happened Tobias?" asked Barbara eagerly. "Just wait. How I tell everything once?" exclaimed Deta. "Tobias apprentice Mels, made master, came home village married sister Adelheid. They always fond lived happily man wife. But joy short. Two years afterwards, Tobias helping build house, beam fell killed him. Adelheid thrown violent fever grief fright, never recovered it. She never strong often suffered queer spells, know whether awake asleep. Only weeks Tobias's death buried poor Adelheid. "People said heaven punished uncle misdeeds. After death son never spoke living soul. Suddenly moved Alp, live enmity God man. "My mother I took Adelheid's little year-old baby, Heidi, live us. When I went Ragatz I took me; spring family whose work I done last year came Frankfurt resolved take town-house. I glad get good position." "And want hand child terrible old man. I really wonder it, Deta!" said Barbara reproach voice. "It seems I really done enough child. I know else take her, young come Frankfurt. By way, Barbara, going? We half-way Alm already." Deta shook hands companion stood still Barbara approached tiny, dark-brown mountain hut, lay hollow steps away path. Situated half-way Alm, cottage luckily protected mighty winds. Had exposed tempests, would doubtful habitation state decay in. Even was, doors windows rattled old rafters shook south wind swept mountain side. If hut stood Alm top, wind would blown valley without much ado storm season came. Here lived Peter goatherd, boy eleven years old, daily fetched goats village drove mountain short luscious grasses pastures. Peter raced evening light-footed little goats. When whistled sharply fingers, every owner would come get goat. These owners mostly small boys girls and, goats friendly, fear them. That time Peter spent children, rest day animals sole companions. At home lived mother old blind grandmother, spent enough time hut swallow bread milk breakfast repast supper. After sought bed sleep. He always left early morning night came home late, could friends long possible. His father met accident years ago; also called Peter goatherd. His mother, whose name Brigida, called "Goatherd Peter's wife" blind grandmother called young old many miles "grandmother." Deta waited ten minutes see children coming behind goats. As could find anywhere, climbed little higher get better view valley there, peered side side marks great impatience countenance. The children meantime ascending slowly zigzag way, Peter always knowing find sorts good grazing places goats could nibble. Thus strayed side side. The poor little girl followed boy greatest effort panting heavy clothes. She hot uncomfortable climbed exerting strength. She say anything looked enviously Peter, jumped easily light trousers bare feet. She envied even goats climbed bushes, stones, steep inclines slender legs. Suddenly sitting ground child swiftly took shoes stockings. Getting undid heavy shawl two little dresses. Out slipped without ado stood light petticoat. In sheer delight relief, threw dimpled arms, bare short sleeves. To save trouble carrying them, aunt dressed Sunday clothes workday garments. Heidi arranged dresses neatly heap joined Peter goats. She light-footed them. When Peter, paid much attention, saw suddenly light attire, grinned. Looking back, saw little heap dresses ground grinned yet more, till mouth seemed reach ear ear; said never word. The child, feeling free comfortable, started converse Peter, answer many questions. She asked many goats had, led them, got there, forth. [Illustration: SHE UNDID THE HEAVY SHAWL AND THE TWO LITTLE DRESSES] At last children reached summit front hut. When Deta saw little party climbers cried shrilly: "Heidi, done? What sight are! Where dresses shawl? Are new shoes gone I bought you, new stockings I made myself? Where all, Heidi?" The child quietly pointed said "There." The aunt followed direction finger descried little heap small red dot middle, recognized shawl. "Unlucky child!" Deta said excitedly. "What mean? Why taken things off?" "Because I need them," said child, seeming least repentant deed. "How stupid, Heidi? Have lost senses?" aunt went on, tone mingled vexation reproach. "Who think go way fetch things again? It half-an-hour's walk. Please, Peter, run get them. Do stand stare glued spot." "I late already," replied Peter, stood without moving place where, hands trousers' pockets, witnessed violent outbreak Heidi's aunt. "There are, standing staring, get further," said Deta. "I give go down." With held five-penny-piece eyes. That made Peter start great hurry ran straightest path. He arrived short time Deta praise gave little coin without delay. He often get treasure, therefore face beaming laughingly dropped money deep pocket. "If going uncle, are, carry pack till get there," said Deta. They still climb steep ascent lay behind Peter's hut. The boy readily took things followed Deta, left arm holding bundle right swinging stick. Heidi jumped along gaily side goats. After three quarters hour reached height hut old man stood prominent rock, exposed every wind, bathed full sunlight. From could gaze far valley. Behind hut stood three old fir-trees great shaggy branches. Further back old grey rocks rose high sheer. Above could see green fertile pastures, till last stony boulders reached bare, steep cliffs. Overlooking valley uncle made bench, side hut. Here sat, pipe teeth hands resting knees. He quietly watched children climbing goats Aunt Deta behind them, children caught long ago. Heidi reached top first, approaching old man held hand said: "Good evening, grandfather!" "Well, well, mean?" replied old man rough voice.

You cannot blame I want earn money now. If cannot keep child, whatever please. If comes harm responsible I sure want burden conscience further." Deta said excitement intended, conscience quite clear. The uncle risen last words gave look retreated steps. Stretching arm commanding gesture, said her: "Away you! Begone! Stay wherever came venture soon sight!" Deta told twice. She said "Good-bye" Heidi "Farewell" uncle, started mountain. Like steam excitement seemed drive forward, ran tremendous rate. The people village called way up, wondering left child.

"She knows eyes right place," grandfather said himself, walked around hut, fastening nail loose board there. He wandered hammer nails, repairing whatever need fixing. Heidi followed every step watched performance great enjoyment attention. At last evening came. The old fir-trees rustling mighty wind roaring howling tree-tops. Those sounds thrilled Heidi's heart filled happiness joy. She danced jumped trees, sounds made feel wonderful thing happened her. The grandfather stood door, watching her, suddenly shrill whistle heard. Heidi stood still grandfather joined outside. Down heights came one goat another, Peter midst. Uttering cry joy, Heidi ran middle flock, greeting old friends. When reached hut, stopped way two beautiful slender goats came herd, one white brown. They came grandfather, held salt hands them, every night. Heidi tenderly caressed first one other, seeming beside joy. "Are ours, grandfather? Do belong us? Are going stable? Are going stay us?"

He always morning sun, rose early mountain-side summer days. It wild, stormy night; hut shaking gusts boards creaking. The wind howled chimney old fir-trees shook strongly many dry branch came crashing down. In middle night grandfather got up, saying himself: "I sure afraid." Climbing ladder, went Heidi's bed. The first moment everything lay darkness, sudden moon came behind clouds sent brilliant light across Heidi's bed. Her cheeks burning red lay peacefully round chubby arms. She must happy dream, smiling sleep. The grandfather stood watched till cloud flew moon left everything total darkness. Then went seek bed again. III ON THE PASTURE Heidi awakened early next morning loud whistle. Opening eyes, saw little bed hay beside bathed golden sunlight. For short know was, heard grandfather's deep voice outside, recollected everything. She remembered come mountain day left old Ursula, always shivering cold sat near stove day. While Heidi lived Ursula, always obliged keep house, old woman could see her. Being deaf, Ursula afraid let Heidi go outdoors, child often fretted narrow room longed run outside. She therefore delighted find new home hardly could wait see goats again. Jumping bed, put things short time went ladder ran outside. Peter already flock, waiting Schwänli Bärli, grandfather bringing join goats. "Do want go pasture?" asked grandfather. "Yes," cried Heidi, clapping hands. "Go now, wash first, sun laugh sees dirty are. Everything ready you," added, pointing large tub water stood sun. Heidi told, washed rubbed till cheeks glowing. In meanwhile grandfather called Peter come hut bring bag along. The boy followed old man, commanded open bag carried scanty dinner.

The child rubbed violently coarse towel grandfather put beside tub face, neck arms red lobster. With smile grandfather said: "No, cannot laugh now; come home to-night must go tub like fish. When one goes like goats, one gets dirty feet. Be off!" They started merrily Alp. A cloudless, deep-blue sky looked them, wind driven away every little cloud night. The fresh green mountain-side bathed brilliant sunlight, many blue yellow flowers opened. Heidi wild joy ran side side. In one place saw big patches fine red primroses, another spot blue gentians sparkled grass, everywhere golden rock-roses nodding her. In transport finding treasures, Heidi even forgot Peter goats. She ran far ahead strayed away one side, sparkling flowers tempted there. Picking whole bunches take home her, put little apron. Peter, whose round eyes could move slowly, hard time looking her. The goats even worse, shouting whistling, especially swinging rod, could drive together. "Heidi, now?" called quite angrily. "Here," sounded somewhere. Peter could see her, sitting ground behind little mound, covered fragrant flowers. The whole air filled perfume, child drew in, long breaths. "Follow now!" Peter called out. "The grandfather told look you, must fall rocks." "Where they?" asked Heidi without even stirring. "Way there, still far go. If come quickly, may see eagle hear shriek." That tempted Heidi, came running Peter, apron full flowers. "You enough now," declared. "If pick to-day, left to-morrow." Heidi admitted that, besides apron already full. From stayed Peter's side. The goats, scenting pungent herbs, also hurried without delay. Peter generally took quarters day foot high cliff, seemed reach far sky. Overhanging rocks one side made dangerous, grandfather wise warn Peter. After reached destination, boy took bag, putting little hollow ground. The wind often blew violent gusts there, Peter want lose precious load. Then lay sunny grass, tired. Heidi, taking apron, rolled tightly together put beside Peter's bag. Then, sitting beside boy, looked her. Far saw glistening valley; large field snow rose high front her. Heidi sat long time without stirring, Peter asleep side goats climbing bushes. A light breeze fanned cheek big mountains made feel happy never before. She looked mountain-tops till seemed faces, soon familiar her, like old friends. Suddenly heard loud, sharp scream, looking beheld largest bird ever seen, flying her. With outspread wings flew large circles Heidi's head. "Wake up, Peter!" Heidi called. "Look up, Peter, see eagle there!" Peter got wide wake, watched bird breathlessly. It rose higher higher azure, till disappeared last behind mountain-peak. "Where gone?" Heidi asked. "Home nest," Peter's answer. "Oh, really live way there? How wonderful must be! But tell screams loud?" Heidi inquired. "Because to," Peter replied. "Oh, let us climb see nest!" implored Heidi, Peter, expressing decided disapproval voice, answered: "Oh dear, Oh dear, even goats could climb there! Grandfather told let fall rocks, cannot go!" Peter began call loudly whistle, soon goats assembled green field. Heidi ran midst, loved see leaping playing about. Peter meantime preparing dinner Heidi himself, putting large pieces one side small ones other. Then milked Bärli put full bowl middle. When ready, called little girl. But took time obeyed call. [Illustration: SHE HANDED HIM ALSO THE WHOLE SLICE OF CHEESE] "Stop jumping, now," said Peter, "and sit down; dinner ready." "Is milk me?" inquired. "Yes is; large pieces also belong you. When milk, I get more. After I get mine." "What milk get?" Heidi inquired. "I get goat, speckled one there. But go ahead eat!" Peter commanded again. Heidi obeyed, bowl empty, filled again. Breaking piece bread herself, gave Peter rest, still bigger portion been. She handed also whole slice cheese, saying: "You eat that, I enough!" Peter speechless surprise, would impossible ever give share. Not taking Heidi earnest, hesitated till put things knees. Then saw really meant it, seized prize. Nodding thanks her, ate luxurious meal ever life. Heidi watching goats meantime, asked Peter names. The boy could tell her, names thing carry head. She soon knew them, too, listened attentively. One Big Turk, tried stick big horns others. Most goats ran away rough comrade. The bold Thistlefinch alone afraid, running horns three four times other, astonished Turk great daring stood still gave fighting, Thistlefinch sharp horns met warlike attitude. A small, white goat, called Snowhopper, kept bleating piteous way, induced Heidi console several times. Heidi last went little thing again, throwing arms around head, asked, "What matter you, Snowhopper? Why always cry help?" The little goat pressed close Heidi's side became perfectly quiet. Peter still eating, swallows called Heidi: "She unhappy, old goat left us. She sold somebody Mayenfeld two days ago." "Who old goat?" "Her mother, course." "Where grandmother?" "She any." "And grandfather?" "Has either." "Poor little Snowhopper!" said Heidi, drawing little creature tenderly her. "Do grieve more; see, I coming every day now, anything matter, come me." Snowhopper rubbed head Heidi's shoulder stopped bleating. When Peter finally finished dinner, joined Heidi. The little girl observing Schwänli Bärli far cleanest prettiest goats. They evaded obtrusive Turk sort contempt always managed find greenest bushes themselves. She mentioned Peter, replied: "I know! Of course prettiest, uncle washes gives salt. He best stable far." All sudden Peter, lying ground, jumped bounded goats. Heidi, knowing something must happened, followed him. She saw running dangerous abyss side. Peter noticed rash Thistlefinch gone nearer nearer dangerous spot. Peter came time prevent goat falling edge. Unfortunately Peter stumbled stone hurry able catch goat one leg. The Thistlefinch, enraged find stopped charming ramble, bleated furiously. Not able get up, Peter loudly called help. Heidi immediately saw Peter nearly pulling animal's leg. She quickly picked fragrant herbs holding animal's nose, said soothingly: "Come, come, Thistlefinch, sensible. You might fall break leg. That would hurt horribly." The goat turned devoured herbs Heidi held hand. When Peter got feet, led back runaway Heidi's help. When goat safety, raised rod beat punishment. The goat retreated shyly, knew coming. Heidi screamed loudly: "Peter, no, beat him! look scared is." "He well deserves it," snarled Peter, ready strike. But Heidi, seizing arm, shouted, full indignation: "You must hurt him! Let go!" Heidi's eyes sparkling, saw commanding mien, desisted dropped rope. "I let go, give piece cheese to-morrow," said, wanted compensation fright. "You may to-morrow every day, I need it," Heidi assured him. "I shall also give big piece bread, promise never beat goats." "I care," growled Peter, way gave promise. Thus day passed, sun already sinking behind mountains. Sitting grass, Heidi looked bluebells wild roses shining last rays sun. The peaks also started glow, Heidi suddenly called boy: "Oh, Peter, look! everything fire. The mountains burning sky, too. Oh, look! moon fire, too. Do see mountains glow? Oh, beautiful snow looks! Peter, eagle's nest surely fire, too. Oh, look fir-trees there!" Peter quietly peeling rod, looking up, said Heidi: "This fire; always looks like that." "But then?" asked Heidi eagerly, gazing everywhere. "It gets way itself," explained Peter. "Oh look! Everything rosy now! Oh, look mountain snow sharp peaks. What name?" "Mountains names," answered. "Oh, see, beautiful! It looks many, many roses growing cliffs. Oh, getting grey. Oh dear! fire gone over. What terrible shame!" said Heidi quite despondently. "It tomorrow," Peter reassured her. "Come now, go home." When Peter called goats together, started downwards. "Will like every day up?" asked Heidi, eagerly. "It usually is," reply. "What tomorrow?" inquired. "Tomorrow like that, I sure," Peter affirmed. That made Heidi feel happy again. She walked quietly Peter's side, thinking new things seen. At last, reaching hut, found grandfather waiting bench fir-trees. Heidi ran two goats followed, knew master. Peter called her: "Come tomorrow! Good-night!" Heidi gave hand, assuring would come, finding surrounded goats, hugged Snowhopper last time. When Peter disappeared, Heidi returned grandfather. "Oh grandfather! beautiful! I saw fire roses rocks! And see many, many flowers I bringing you!" With Heidi shook apron. But oh, miserable looked! Heidi even know more. "What matter them, grandfather? They looked different!" Heidi exclaimed fright. "They made bloom sun shut apron," said grandfather. "Then I shall never pick more! Please, grandfather, tell eagle screeches loudly," asked Heidi. "First go take bath, I go would get milk. Afterwards go inside together I tell supper-time." They proposed, Heidi sat high chair milk, asked question before. "Because sneering people below, sit villages make angry. He calls them:--'If would go apart live heights like me, would feel much better!'" The grandfather said last words wild voice, reminded Heidi eagle's screech. "Why mountains names, grandfather?" asked Heidi. "They names, tell shape I name you." Heidi described several old man could name all. The child told happenings day, especially wonderful fire. She asked came about. "The sun it," exclaimed. "Saying good-night mountains, throws beautiful rays them, may forget till morning." Heidi much pleased explanation, could hardly wait see sun's good-night greetings repeated. It time go bed, Heidi slept soundly night. She dreamt little Snowhopper bounding happily glowing mountains many glistening roses blooming round her. IV IN THE GRANDMOTHER'S HUT Next morning Peter came goats, Heidi went pasture them. This happened day day, healthy life Heidi grew stronger, sunburnt every day. Soon autumn came wind blowing across mountainside, grandfather would say: "You must stay home to-day, Heidi; wind blow little thing valley single gust." It always made Peter unhappy Heidi come along, saw nothing misfortunes ahead him; hardly knew pass time, besides, deprived abundant dinner. The goats accustomed Heidi time, follow Peter him. Heidi mind staying home, loved nothing better watch grandfather saw hammer. Sometimes grandfather would make small round cheeses days, greater pleasure Heidi see stir butter bare arms. When wind would howl fir-trees stormy days, Heidi would run grove, thrilled happy wondrous roaring branches. The sun lost vigor, child put shoes stockings little dress. The weather got colder colder, Peter came morning, would blow hands, frozen. At last even Peter could come more, deep snow fallen night. Heidi stood window, watching snow falling down. It kept snowing till reached windows; still stop, soon windows could opened, shut in. When lasted several days, Heidi thought would soon cover cottage.

[Illustration: OFF THEY STARTED AT SUCH A PACE THAT HEIDI SHOUTED FOR JOY] Opening door, Heidi found tiny, dark kitchen, going another door, entered narrow chamber. Near table woman seated, busy mending Peter's coat, Heidi recognized immediately. A bent old woman sitting corner, Heidi, approaching once, said: "How do, grandmother?

Heidi shook head doubtfully prospects. "Everybody must learn read, Heidi. Mr. Candidate patient explain you. You know means first, difficult understand him. It take long learn, though, know means." When Miss Rottenmeier found unable recall Deta, came back children. She excited mood, felt responsible Heidi's coming know cancel unfortunate step. She soon got go dining-room, criticising butler giving orders maid. Sebastian, daring show rage otherwise, noisily opened folding doors. When went Clara's chair, saw Heidi watching intently. At last said: "You look like Peter." Miss Rottenmeier horrified remark, sent dining-room. After Clara lifted chair, housekeeper sat beside her. Heidi motioned sit opposite lady. In way placed enormous table. When Heidi saw roll plate, turned Sebastian, pointing it, asked, "Can I this?" Heidi already great confidence butler, especially account resemblance discovered. The butler nodded, saw Heidi put bread pocket, could hardly keep laughing. He came Heidi dish small baked fishes. For long time child move; turning eyes butler, said: "Must I eat that?"

Suddenly Heidi remembered happenings previous day. Jumping bed, dressed great hurry. She eager look sky ground below, always done home. What disappointment found windows high see anything except walls windows opposite. Trying open them, turned one other, vain. The poor child felt like little bird placed glittering cage first time. At last resign herself, sat low stool, thinking melting snow slopes first flowers spring hailed delight. Suddenly Tinette opened door said curtly: "Breakfast's ready." Heidi take summons, maid's face scornful forbidding. She waiting patiently would happen next, Miss Rottenmeier burst room, saying: "What matter, Adelheid? Did understand? Come breakfast!" Heidi immediately followed lady dining-room, Clara greeted smile. She looked much happier usual, expected new things happen day. When breakfast passed without disturbance, two children allowed go library together soon left alone. "How I see ground?" Heidi asked. "Open window peep out," replied Clara, amused question. "But impossible open them," Heidi said, sadly. "Oh no. You cannot I cannot help you, either, ask Sebastian you." Heidi relieved. The poor child felt like prisoner room. Clara asked Heidi home like, Heidi told gladly life hut. The tutor arrived meantime, asked go study usual. Miss Rottenmeier much excited Heidi's coming complications arose therefrom. She really responsible it, arranged everything herself. She presented unfortunate case teacher, wanted help get rid child. Mr. Candidate, however, always careful judgments, afraid teaching beginners.

Come see done." When Heidi saw devastation caused, greatly surprised, noticed hurry. "This must never happen again," said lady sternly. "You must sit quiet lessons; get I shall tie chair. Do hear me?" Heidi understood, gave promise sit quietly lessons time on. After servants straightened room, late, time studies. Nobody time yawn morning. In afternoon, Clara resting, Heidi left herself. She planted hall waited butler come up-stairs silver things. When reached head stairs, said him: "I want ask something." She saw butler seemed angry, reassured saying mean harm. "All right, Miss, it?" "My name Miss, call Heidi?" "Miss Rottenmeier told call Miss." "Did she? Well then, must so.

"What want see? Did anybody send you?" asked man. "No; I want look there." "Get home try again." With tower-keeper going shut door, Heidi held coat-tails pleaded let come. The tower-keeper looked child's eyes, nearly full tears. "All right, come along, care much," said, taking hand. The two climbed many, many steps, got narrower time. When arrived top, old man lifted Heidi open window. Heidi saw nothing sea chimneys, roofs towers, heart sank. "Oh, dear, different way I thought would be," said. "There! could little girl know view? We go must promise never ring tower more." On way passed attic, large grey cat guarded new family basket. This cat caught half-a-dozen mice every day herself, old tower full rats mice.

The boy waiting patiently her, taken leave tower-keeper, asked boy: "Do know Mr. Sesemann's house is?" "No," reply. She described well could, till boy remembered it. Off started, soon Heidi found pulling door-bell. When Sebastian arrived said: "Hurry up." Heidi went in, boy left outside, Sebastian even seen him. "Come quickly, little Miss," urged. "They waiting dining-room. Miss Rottenmeier looks like loaded cannon. How could run away like that?" Heidi sat quietly chair. Nobody said word, uncomfortable silence. At last Miss Rottenmeier began severe solemn voice: "I shall speak later, Adelheid. How leave house without word? Your behavior remiss. The idea walking till late!" "Meow!" reply. "I not," Heidi began--"Meow!" Sebastian nearly flung dish table, disappeared. "This enough," Miss Rottenmeier tried say, voice hoarse fury. "Get leave room." [Illustration: OFF THEY STARTED, AND SOON HEIDI WAS PULLING THE DOOR-BELL] Heidi got up. She began again. "I made--" "Meow! meow! meow!--" "Heidi," said Clara now, "why always say 'meow' again, see Miss Rottenmeier angry?" "I it, kittens," explained. "What? Cats? Kittens?" screamed housekeeper.

He foreseen excitement, caught sight kittens Heidi came in. The scene peaceful one now; Clara held little kittens lap, Heidi kneeling beside her. They played happily two graceful creatures. The butler promised look new-comers prepared bed basket. A long time afterwards, time go bed, Miss Rottenmeier cautiously opened door. "Are away?" asked. "Yes," replied butler, quickly seizing kittens taking away. The lecture Miss Rottenmeier going give Heidi postponed following day, lady much exhausted fright. They went quietly bed, children happy thought kittens comfortable bed. [Illustration] VIII GREAT DISTURBANCES IN THE SESEMANN HOUSE A short time tutor arrived next morning, door-bell rang violently Sebastian thought must Mr. Sesemann himself. What surprise dirty street-boy, barrel-organ back, stood him! "What mean pulling bell like that?" butler said. "I want see Clara." "Cannot least say 'Miss Clara', ragged urchin?" said Sebastian harshly. "She owes forty pennies," said boy. "You crazy! How know Miss Clara lives here?" "I showed way yesterday promised give forty pennies." "What nonsense! Miss Clara never goes out. You better take off, I send you!" The boy, however, even budge, said: "I saw her. She curly hair, black eyes talks funny way." "Oh," Sebastian chuckled himself, "that little Miss." Pulling boy house, said: "All right, follow me. Wait door till I call you, play something Miss Clara." Knocking study-door, Sebastian said, entered: "A boy wants see Miss Clara." Clara, delighted interruption, said: "Cannot come right up, Mr. Candidate?" But boy already inside, started play. Miss Rottenmeier adjoining room heard sounds. Where come from? Hurrying study, saw street-boy playing eager children. "Stop! stop!" called, vain, music drowned voice. Suddenly made big jump, there, feet, crawled black turtle. Only shrieked Sebastian could voice heard. The butler came straight in, seen everything behind door, great scene been! Glued chair fright, Miss Rottenmeier called: "Send boy away! Take away!" Sebastian obediently pulled boy him; said: "Here forty pennies Miss Clara forty playing. It well done, boy." With closed door behind him. Miss Rottenmeier found wiser stay study prevent disturbances. Suddenly another knock door. Sebastian appeared large basket, brought Clara. "We better lesson inspect it," said Miss Rottenmeier. But Clara, turning tutor, asked: "Oh, please, Mr. Candidate, cannot peep in, see is?" "I afraid think nothing else," teacher began. Just something basket, lightly fastened, moved, one, two, three still little kittens jumped out, scampering around room utmost speed. They bounded tutor's boots bit trousers; climbed Miss Rottenmeier's dress crawled around feet. Mewing running, caused frightful confusion. Clara called delight: "Oh, look cunning creatures; look jump! Heidi, look one, oh, see one there?" Heidi followed about, teacher shook off. When housekeeper collected wits great fright, called servants. They soon arrived stored little kittens safely new bed. No time found yawning day, either! When Miss Rottenmeier, found culprit, alone children evening, began severely: "Adelheid, one punishment you. I going send cellar, think dreadful misdeeds, company rats." A cellar held terrors Heidi, grandfather's cellar fresh milk good cheese kept, rats lodged there. But Clara shrieked: "Oh, Miss Rottenmeier, must wait till Papa comes home, punish Heidi." The lady unwillingly replied: "All right, Clara, I shall also speak words Mr. Sesemann." With words left room. Since child's arrival everything upset, lady often felt discouraged, though nothing remarkable happened days. Clara, contrary, enjoyed companion's society, always funny things. In lesson could never get letters straight. They meant absolutely nothing her, except would remind goats eagles. The girls always spent evenings together, Heidi would entertain friend tales former life, till longing grew great added: "I go home now. I must go tomorrow." Clara's soothing words prospect rolls grandmother kept child. Every day dinner left alone room hours. Thinking green fields home, sparkling flowers mountains, would sit corner till desire things became great bear. Her aunt clearly told might return, wished so, one day resolved leave Alm-hut. In great hurry packed bread red shawl, putting old straw hat, started off. The poor child get far. At door encountered Miss Rottenmeier, stared Heidi mute surprise. "What to?" exploded.

Do get better treatment deserve? Have ever food, service room? Answer!" "No," reply. "Do I know that?" furious lady proceeded. "What thankless child are, idle good-for-nothing!" But Heidi could bear longer. She loudly wailed: "Oh, I want go home. What poor Snowhopper without me? Grandmother waiting every day. Poor Thistlefinch gets blows Peter gets cheese, I must see sun says good-night mountains. How eagle would screech saw people Frankfurt!" "For mercy's sake, child crazy!" exclaimed Miss Rottenmeier, running stairs. In hurry bumped Sebastian, coming down. "Bring unlucky child up!" called him, rubbing head. "All right, many thanks," answered butler, rubbing head, too, encountered something far harder had. When butler came down, saw Heidi standing near door flaming eyes, trembling over. Cheerfully asked: "What happened, little one? Do take heart, cheer up. She nearly made hole head now, must get discouraged. Oh, no!--Come, you; said so!" Heidi walked up-stairs slowly. Seeing changed, Sebastian said: "Do give in! Do sad! You courageous till now; I never heard cry yet. Come now, lady's away go look kittens. They running round like wild!" Nodding cheerlessly, child disappeared room. That night supper Miss Rottenmeier watched Heidi constantly, nothing happened. The child sat quiet mouse, hardly touching food, except little roll. Talking tutor next morning, Miss Rottenmeier told fears Heidi's mind. But teacher serious troubles still, Heidi even learned A,B,C time. Heidi sorely need clothes, Clara given some. Miss Rottenmeier busy arranging child's wardrobe, suddenly returned. "Adelheid," said contemptuously, "what I find? A big pile bread wardrobe! I never heard like. Yes, Clara, true." Then, calling Tinette, ordered take away bread old straw hat found. "No, not! I must keep hat! The bread grandmother," cried Heidi despair. "You stay here, take rubbish away," said lady sternly. Heidi threw Clara's chair sobbed heart would break. "Now I cannot bring grandmother rolls! Oh, grandmother!" lamented. "Heidi, cry more," Clara begged. "Listen! When go home day, I going give many rolls had, more. They much softer better stale ones kept. Those fit eat, Heidi. Stop now, please, cry more!" Only long, long time Heidi become quiet. When heard Clara's promise, cried: "Are really going give many I had?" At supper, Heidi's eyes swollen still hard keep crying. Sebastian made strange signs understand. What mean? Later, though, climbed high bed, found old beloved straw hat hidden cover. So Sebastian saved tried tell her! She crushed joy, wrapping handkerchief, hid furthest corner wardrobe. IX THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HEARS OF STRANGE DOINGS A days afterwards great excitement Sesemann residence, master house arrived. The servants taking upstairs one load another, Mr. Sesemann always brought many lovely things home him. When entered daughter's room, Heidi shyly retreated corner.

With went study. Since day Heidi's attempted flight great change come child. She realized would hurt kind friends tried go home again. She knew could leave, Aunt Deta promised, all, especially Clara father old lady, would think ungrateful. But burden grew heavier heart lost appetite, got paler paler. She could get sleep night longing see mountains flowers sunshine, dreams would happy. When woke morning, always found high white bed, far away home. Burying head pillow, would often weep long, long time. Mrs. Sesemann noticed child's unhappiness, let days pass by, hoping change. But change never came, often Heidi's eyes red even early morning. So called child room one day said, great sympathy voice: "Tell me, Heidi, matter you? What making sad?" But Heidi want appear thankless, replied sadly: "I cannot tell you." "No?

Heidi still looked book going bed night, book became dearest treasure. She would look beautiful pictures read stories aloud Clara. Grandmama would quietly listen explain something there, making beautiful before. Heidi loved pictures shepherd best all; told story prodigal son, child would read re-read till nearly knew heart. Since Heidi learned read possessed book, days seemed fly, time come near grandmama fixed departure.

She talked Heidi amused various ways, showing make clothes pretty little dolls brought. Unconsciously Heidi learned sew, made sweetest dresses coats little people lovely materials grandmama would give her. Often Heidi would read old lady, oftener read stories dearer became her. The child lived everything people tales always happy again. But never looked really cheerful eyes never sparkled merrily before. In last week Mrs. Sesemann's stay, Heidi called old lady's room. The child entered beloved book arm. Mrs. Sesemann drew Heidi close her, laying book aside, said: "Come, child, tell sad. Do still sorrow?" "Yes," Heidi replied. "Did confide Our Lord?" "Yes."

Full repentance, said: "I shall go ask Our Father pardon me. I shall never forget Him more!" "That right, Heidi; I sure He help time, trust Him," grandmother consoled her. Heidi went room prayed earnestly God He would forgive fulfill wish. The day departure come, Mrs. Sesemann arranged everything way children hardly realized actually going. Still everything empty quiet gone, children hardly knew pass time. Next day, Heidi came Clara afternoon said: "Can I always, always read now, Clara?" Clara assented, Heidi began. But get far, story reading told grandmother's death. Suddenly cried aloud: "Oh, grandmother dead!" wept pitiful fashion. Whatever Heidi read always seemed real her, thought grandmother home.

She pictured terrible would dear old grandfather would die far away. How quiet empty would hut, lonely would be! Miss Rottenmeier overheard scene, approaching sobbing child said impatiently: "Adelheid, screamed enough. If I hear giving way noisy fashion, I shall take book away forever!" Heidi turned pale that, book greatest treasure. Quickly drying tears, choked sobs. After Heidi never cried again; often could hardly repress sobs obliged make strangest faces keep crying out. Clara often looked her, full surprise, Miss Rottenmeier notice found occasion carry threat. However, poor child got cheerless every day, looked thin pale Sebastian became worried. He tried encourage table help good dishes, listlessly would let pass hardly touch them. In evening would cry quietly, heart bursting longing go home. Thus time passed by. Heidi never knew summer winter, walls opposite never changed. They drove seldom, Clara able go short distance. They never saw anything else streets, houses busy people; grass, fir-trees mountains. Heidi struggled constantly sorrow, vain. Autumn winter passed, Heidi knew time coming Peter would go Alp goats, flowers glistening sunshine mountains afire. She would sit corner room put hands eyes, see glaring sunshine opposite wall. There would remain, eating heart away longing, till Clara would call come.

When doctor laughed, Mr. Sesemann continued: "I call sympathy; I wish friend Miss Rottenmeier could hear you. She convinced old Sesemann wandering about, expiating dreadful deed." "How make acquaintance?" asked doctor, much amused. Mr. Sesemann explained circumstances. He said matter either bad joke acquaintance servants playing absence, gang thieves, who, intimidating people, would surely rob house by. With explanations entered room two servants watched before. A bottles wine stood table two bright candelabra would brilliant light. Two revolvers ready emergencies. They left door partly open, much light might drive ghost away. Then, sitting comfortably, two men passed time chatting, taking sip then. "The ghost seems spied us probably come to-day," said doctor. "We must patience. It supposed come one," replied friend.

"Then swallow down? Yes? Do like here?" "Oh yes," faint, uncertain reply. "Where live grandfather?" "Up Alp." "But little lonely there?" "Oh no, beautiful!"--But Heidi could say more. The recollection, excitement night restrained sorrow overpowered child. The tears rushed violently eyes broke loud sobs. The doctor rose, soothing her, said: "It hurt cry; go sleep afterward, wake everything come right." Then left room. Joining anxious friend down-stairs, said: "Sesemann, little girl sleep-walker, unconsciously scared whole household. Besides, home-sick little body wasted away. We shall act quickly.

But soon heard grandfather's voice outside, remembered everything would jump merrily bed. After four days gone by, Heidi said grandfather: "I must go grandmother now, alone many days." But grandfather shook head said: "You cannot go yet, child. The snow fathoms deep still falling. Peter hardly get through. A little girl like would snowed lost time.

"Safely homeward may return!" exclaimed: "Oh, grandmother, I know like come home." After said: "It getting dark, grandmother, I must go home now. I glad feel better again." [Illustration: THE TWO CHILDREN WERE ALREADY FLYING DOWN THE ALP] The grandmother, holding child's hand hers, said: "Yes, I happy again, though I stay bed. Nobody knows hard lie alone, day day. I hear word anybody cannot see ray sunlight. I sad thoughts sometimes, often I feel I could bear longer. But I hear blessed songs read me, makes feel light shining heart, giving purest joy." Shaking hands, child said good-night, pulling Peter her, ran outside. The brilliant moon shining white snow, light day. The two children already flying Alp, like birds soaring air. After Heidi gone bed night, lay awake little while, thinking everything grandmother said, especially joy songs given her. If poor grandmother could hear comforting words every day!

Suddenly Heidi idea, thrilled felt could wait till morning came put plan execution. But excitement forgotten evening prayer, sitting bed, prayed fervently God. Then, falling back fragrant hay, soon slept peacefully soundly still bright morning came. [Illustration] XIX WINTER STILL CONTINUES Peter arrived punctually school next day. He brought lunch bag, children came far away ate school, others went home. In evening Peter usual paid visit Heidi. The minute opened door ran him, saying: "Peter, I tell something." "Say it," replied. "You must learn read now," said child. "I done already." "Yes, yes, Peter, I mean way," Heidi eagerly proceeded; "you must learn really know afterwards."

You must think one teacher there, kind one here. No, indeed! There whole rows them, walking high black hats heads. I saw myself, I driving!" Cold shivers ran Peter's back. "Yes, go there, find cannot read even spell, laugh you!" "I it," said Peter, half angry half frightened. "Oh, I glad. Let us start right away!" said Heidi joyfully, pulling Peter table. Among things Clara sent, Heidi found little book A,B,C rhymes. She chosen lessons. Peter, spell first rhyme, found great difficulty, Heidi said, "I read you, able better.

Heidi, stopping, looked Peter, frightened threats mysterious horrors sat still mouse. Heidi's tender heart touched, said comfortingly: "Do afraid, Peter; come every day, soon learn letters things happen. But come every day, even snows. Promise!" Peter so, departed. Obeying Heidi's instructions, came daily lesson. Sometimes grandfather would sit room, smoking pipe; often corners mouth would twitch could hardly keep laughing.

He arrived day, hours mother's departure, now, taking carriage, drove Mayenfeld. The long ascent Alp seemed weary far traveller. When would reach goat-herd's hut? There many little roads branching several directions, sometimes Mr. Sesemann doubted taken right path. But soul near, sound could heard except rustling wind hum little insects. A merry little bird singing larch-tree, nothing more. Standing still cooling brow, saw boy running hill topmost speed. Mr. Sesemann called him, success, boy kept shy distance. "Now, boy, cannot tell I right path hut Heidi lives people Frankfurt staying?" A dull sound terror reply. Peter shot rushed head heels mountain-side, turning wild somersaults perilous way. His course resembled course enemy taken days ago. [Illustration: PETER SHOT OFF AND RUSHED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE, TURNING WILD SOMERSAULTS ON HIS PERILOUS WAY] "What funny, bashful mountaineer!" Mr. Sesemann remarked himself, thinking appearance stranger upset simple son Alps. After watching downward course boy little while, soon proceeded way. In spite greatest effort, Peter could stop himself, kept rolling on. But fright terror still terrible bumps blows. This stranger policeman, certain fact! At last, thrown bush, clutched wildly. "Good, another one!" voice near Peter said. "I wonder going pushed tomorrow, looking like half-open potato-bag?" The village baker making fun him. For little rest weary work, quietly watched boy. Peter regained feet slunk away. How baker know chair pushed? He longed go home bed hide, alone felt safe. But go goats, uncle clearly told come back quickly could. Groaning, limped away Alp. How could run now, fear poor, sore limbs? Mr. Sesemann reached hut soon meeting Peter, felt reassured. Climbing further, renewed courage, last saw goal him, without long weary exertion. He saw Alm-hut him, swaying fir-trees. Mr. Sesemann eagerly hurried encounter beloved child. They seen long ago hut, treat prepared never suspected. As made last steps, saw two forms coming towards him. A tall girl, light hair rosy face, leaning Heidi, whose dark eyes sparkled keen delight. Mr. Sesemann stopped short, staring vision. Suddenly big tears rushed eyes, shape recalled sweet memories. Clara's mother looked exactly like fair maiden. Mr. Sesemann moment know awake dreaming. "Papa, know more?" Clara called beaming eyes. "Have I changed much?" Mr. Sesemann rushed her, folding arms. "Yes, _have_ changed. How possible? Is really true?

While two men, last approached other, conversing, grandmama walked grove. There, fir-trees, another surprise awaited her. A beautiful bunch wondrously blue gentians stood grown there. "How exquisite, wonderful! What sight!" exclaimed, clapping hands. "Heidi, come here! Have brought those? Oh, beautiful!" The children joined her, Heidi assuring another person's deed. "Oh grandmama, pasture looks like that," Clara remarked. "Just guess brought flowers?" At moment rustle heard, saw Peter, trying sneak behind trees avoid hut. Immediately old lady called him, thought Peter picked flowers her. He must creeping away sheer modesty, kind lady thought. To give reward, called: "Come here, boy! afraid." Petrified fear, Peter stood still. What gone robbed courage. He thought him. With hair standing end pale face distorted anguish, approached. "Come straight me, boy," old lady encouraged him. "Now tell me, boy, done that." In anxiety, Peter see grandmama's finger pointed flowers. He saw uncle standing near hut, looking penetratingly, beside policeman, greatest horror world. Trembling every limb, Peter answered, "Yes!" "Well, frightened about?" "Because--because broken never mended again," Peter said, knees tottering him. The grandmama walked hut: "My dear uncle," asked kindly, "is poor lad mind?" "Not all," reply; "only boy wind blew away wheel-chair. He expecting punishment well deserves." Grandmama much surprised, vowed Peter looked far wicked. Why destroyed chair? The uncle told noticed many signs anger boy since Clara's advent Alp. He assured suspected boy beginning. "My dear uncle," old lady said animation, "we must punish further. We must just. It hard Clara robbed Heidi, greatest treasure. When sit alone day day, roused passion drove wicked deed.
