 THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS CHAPTER 1. THE COUNCIL OF WAYS AND MEANS This story different ways looked treasure, I think read see lazy looking. There things I must tell I begin tell treasure-seeking, I read books myself, I know beastly story begins, “‘Alas!” said Hildegarde deep sigh, “we must look last ancestral home”’--and one else says something--and know pages pages home is, Hildegarde is, anything it. Our ancestral home Lewisham Road. It semi-detached garden, large one. We Bastables. There six us besides Father. Our Mother dead, think care I tell much show understand people all. Dora eldest. Then Oswald--and Dicky. Oswald Latin prize preparatory school--and Dicky good sums. Alice Noel twins: ten, Horace Octavius youngest brother. It one us tells story--but I shall tell which: end perhaps I will. While story going may trying guess, I bet not. It Oswald first thought looking treasure. Oswald often thinks interesting things. And directly thought keep himself, boys would done, told others, said-- ‘I tell what, must go seek treasure: always restore fallen fortunes House.’ Dora said well. She often says that. She trying mend large hole one Noel’s stockings. He tore nail playing shipwrecked mariners top chicken-house day H. O. fell cut chin: scar still. Dora one us ever tries mend anything. Alice tries make things sometimes. Once knitted red scarf Noel chest delicate, much wider one end other, would wear it. So used pennon, well, things black grey since Mother died; scarlet nice change. Father like ask new things. That one way knowing fortunes ancient House Bastable really fallen. Another way pocket-money--except penny little ones, people come dinner more, like used to, pretty dresses, driving cabs--and carpets got holes them--and legs came things sent mended, gave _up_ gardener except front garden, often. And silver big oak plate-chest lined green baize went away shop dents scratches taken it, never came back. We think Father enough money pay silver man taking dents scratches. The new spoons forks yellowy-white, heavy old ones, never shone first day two. Father ill Mother died; ill business-partner went Spain--and never much money afterwards. I know why. Then servants left one, General. A great deal comfort happiness depends good General. The last one nice: used make jolly good currant puddings us, let us dish floor pretend wild boar killing forks. But General nearly always makes sago puddings, watery kind, cannot pretend anything them, even islands, like porridge. Then left going school, Father said go good school soon could manage it. He said holiday would us good. We thought right, wished told us could afford it. For course knew. Then great many people used come door envelopes stamps them, sometimes got angry, said calling last time putting hands. I asked Eliza meant, kindly explained me, I sorry Father. And long, blue paper came; policeman brought it, frightened. But Father said right, went kiss girls bed said crying, though I sure true. Because cowards snivellers cry, Father bravest man world. So see time looked treasure Oswald said so, Dora said well. But others agreed Oswald. So held council. Dora chair--the big dining-room chair, let fireworks from, Fifth November measles could garden. The hole never mended, chair nursery, I think cheap blowing-up boys got hole burnt. ‘We must something,’ said Alice, ‘because exchequer empty.’ She rattled money-box spoke, really rattle always keep bad sixpence luck. ‘Yes--but shall do?’ said Dicky. ‘It jolly easy say let us _something_.’ Dicky always wants everything settled exactly. Father calls Definite Article. ‘Let us read books again. We shall get lots ideas them.’ It Noel suggested this, made shut up, knew well enough wanted get back old books. Noel poet. He sold poetry once--and printed, come part story. Then Dicky said, ‘Look here. We quite quiet ten minutes clock--and think way find treasure. And thought try ways one other, beginning eldest.’ ‘I shall able think ten minutes, make half hour,’ said H. O. His real name Horace Octavius, call H. O. advertisement, long ago afraid pass hoarding says ‘Eat H. O.’ big letters. He says little boy, I remember last Christmas one, woke middle night crying howling, said pudding. But told afterwards dreaming really _had_ come eat H. O., could pudding, come think it, plain. Well, made half hour--and sat quiet, thought thought. And I made mind two minutes over, I saw others had, Dora, always awful time everything. I got pins needles leg sitting still long, seven minutes H. O. cried out--‘Oh, must half hour!’ H. O. eight years old, cannot tell clock yet. Oswald could tell clock six. We stretched began speak once, Dora put hands ears said-- ‘One time, please. We playing Babel.’ (It good game. Did ever play it?) So Dora made us sit row floor, ages, pointed us finger brass thimble on. Her silver one got lost last General two went away. We think must forgotten Dora’s put box mistake. She forgetful girl. She used forget spent money on, change never quite right. Oswald spoke first. ‘I think might stop people Blackheath--with crape masks horse-pistols--and say “Your money life! Resistance useless, armed teeth”--like Dick Turpin Claude Duval. It would matter horses, coaches gone too.’ Dora screwed nose way always going talk like good elder sister books, said, ‘That would wrong: like pickpocketing taking pennies Father’s great-coat hanging hall.’ I must say I think need said that, especially little ones--for I four. But Oswald going let see cared, said-- ‘Oh, well. I think lots ways. We could rescue old gentleman deadly Highwaymen.’ ‘There any,’ said Dora. ‘Oh, well, same--from deadly peril, then. There plenty that. Then would turn Prince Wales, would say, “My noble, cherished preserver! Here million pounds year. Rise up, Sir Oswald Bastable.”’ But others seem think so, Alice’s turn say. She said, ‘I think might try divining-rod. I sure I could it. I often read it. You hold stick hands, come gold underneath stick kicks about. So know. And dig.’ ‘Oh,’ said Dora suddenly, ‘I idea. But I say last. I hope divining-rod wrong. I believe wrong Bible.’ ‘So eating pork ducks,’ said Dicky. ‘You cannot go that.’ ‘Anyhow, try ways first,’ said Dora. ‘Now, H. O.’ ‘Let us Bandits,’ said H. O. ‘I dare say wrong would fun pretending.’ ‘I sure wrong,’ said Dora. And Dicky said thought everything wrong. She said not, Dicky disagreeable. So Oswald make peace, said-- ‘Dora need play want to. Nobody asked her. And, Dicky, idiot: dry let us hear Noel’s idea is.’ Dora Dicky look pleased, I kicked Noel table make hurry up, said think wanted play more. That worst it. The others jolly ready quarrel. I told Noel man snivelling pig, last said made mind whether would print poetry book sell it, find princess marry her. ‘Whichever is,’ added, ‘none shall want anything, though Oswald kick me, say I snivelling pig.’ ‘I not,’ said Oswald, ‘I told be.’ And Alice explained quite opposite thought. So agreed drop it. Then Dicky spoke. ‘You must noticed advertisements papers, telling ladies gentlemen easily earn two pounds week spare time, send two shillings sample instructions, carefully packed free observation. Now go school time spare time. So I think could easily earn twenty pounds week each. That would us well. We try things first, directly money send sample instructions. And I another idea, I must think I say.’ We said, ‘Out it--what idea?’ But Dicky said, ‘No.’ That Dicky over. He never show anything making till quite finished, inmost thoughts. But pleased seem want know, Oswald said-- ‘Keep silly old secret, then. Now, Dora, drive ahead. We said except you.’ Then Dora jumped dropped stocking thimble (it rolled away, find days), said-- ‘Let us try way _now_. Besides, I eldest, fair. Let us dig treasure. Not tiresome divining-rod--but plain digging. People dig treasure always find it. And shall rich need try ways all. Some rather difficult: I certain wrong--and must always remember wrong things--’ But told shut come on, did. I could help wondering went garden, Father never thought digging treasure instead going beastly office every day. CHAPTER 2. DIGGING FOR TREASURE I afraid last chapter rather dull. It always dull books people talk talk, anything, I obliged put in, else would understood rest. The best part books things happening. That best part real things too. This I shall tell story days nothing happened. You catch saying, ‘thus sad days passed slowly by’--or ‘the years rolled weary course’--or ‘time went on’--because silly; course time goes on--whether say not. So I shall tell nice, interesting parts--and understand meals got went bed, dull things like that. It would sickening write down, though course happens. I said Albert-next-door’s uncle, writes books, said, ‘Quite right, call selection, necessity true art.’ And clever indeed. So see. I often thought people write books children knew little would better. I shall tell anything us except I like know I reading story writing it. Albert’s uncle says I ought put preface, I never read prefaces, much good writing things people skip. I wonder authors never thought this. Well, agreed dig treasure went cellar lighted gas. Oswald would liked dig there, stone flags. We looked among old boxes broken chairs fenders empty bottles things, last found spades dig sand went seaside three years ago. They silly, babyish, wooden spades, split look them, good iron, blue mark across top iron part, yellow wooden handles. We wasted little time getting dusted, girls would dig spades cobwebs them. Girls would never African explorers anything like that, beastly particular. It use thing halves. We marked sort square mouldy part garden, three yards across, began dig. But found nothing except worms stones--and ground hard. So thought would try another part garden, found place big round flower bed, ground much softer. We thought would make smaller hole begin with, much better. We dug dug dug, jolly hard work! We got hot digging, found nothing. Presently Albert-next-door looked wall. We like much, let play us sometimes, father dead, must unkind orphans, even mothers alive. Albert always tidy. He wears frilly collars velvet knickerbockers. I cannot think bear to. So said, ‘Hallo!’ And said, ‘What to?’ ‘We digging treasure,’ said Alice; ‘an ancient parchment revealed us place concealment. Come help us. When dug deep enough shall find great pot red clay, full gold precious jewels.’ Albert-next-door sniggered said, ‘What silly nonsense!’ He cannot play properly all. It strange, nice uncle. You see, Albert-next-door care reading, read nearly many books have, foolish ignorant, cannot helped, put want anything. Besides, wrong angry people clever yourself. It always faults. So Oswald said, ‘Come dig! Then shall share treasure found it.’ But said, ‘I shall not--I like digging--and I going tea.’ ‘Come along dig, good boy,’ Alice said. ‘You use spade. It much best--’ So came along dug, wall kept it, worked well, course, hole got deep. Pincher worked too--he dog good digging. He digs rats dustbin sometimes, gets dirty. But love dog, even face wants washing. ‘I expect shall make tunnel,’ Oswald said, ‘to reach rich treasure.’ So jumped hole began dig one side. After took turns dig tunnel, Pincher useful scraping earth tunnel--he back feet say ‘Rats!’ digs front ones, burrows nose well. At last tunnel nearly yard long, big enough creep along find treasure, bit longer. Now Albert’s turn go dig, funked it. ‘Take turn like man,’ said Oswald--nobody say Oswald take turn like man. But Albert would not. So make him, fair. ‘It quite easy,’ Alice said. ‘You crawl dig hands. Then come scrape done, spades. Come--be man. You notice dark tunnel shut eyes tight. We except Dora--and like worms.’ ‘I like worms neither.’ Albert-next-door said this; remembered picked fat red black worm fingers thrown Dora day before. So put in. But would go head first, proper way, dig hands done, though Oswald angry time, hates snivellers, yet afterwards owned perhaps well. You never afraid perhaps mistaken--but cowardly unless quite sure wrong. ‘Let go feet first,’ said Albert-next-door. ‘I dig boots--I truly, honour bright.’ So let get feet first--and slowly last in, head sticking hole; rest tunnel. ‘Now dig boots,’ said Oswald; ‘and, Alice, catch hold Pincher, digging another minute, perhaps would uncomfortable Albert Pincher threw mould eyes.’ You always try think little things. Thinking people’s comfort makes like you. Alice held Pincher, shouted, ‘Kick! dig feet, worth!’ So Albert-next-door began dig feet, stood ground him, waiting--and minute ground gave way, tumbled together heap: got little shallow hollow standing, Albert-next-door underneath, stuck quite fast, roof tunnel tumbled him. He horribly unlucky boy anything with. It dreadful way cried screamed, though hurt, rather heavy could move legs. We would dug right enough, time, screamed afraid police would come, Dicky climbed wall, tell cook tell Albert-next-door’s uncle buried mistake, come help dig out. Dicky long time gone. We wondered become him, screaming went on, taken loose earth Albert’s face could scream quite easily comfortably. Presently Dicky came back Albert-next-door’s uncle came him. He long legs, hair light face brown. He sea, writes books. I like him. He told nephew stow it, Albert did, asked hurt--and Albert say not, though coward, unlucky, liar like boys are. ‘This promises protracted agreeable task,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle, rubbing hands looking hole Albert’s head it. ‘I get another spade,’ fetched big spade next-door garden tool-she would, began dig nephew out. ‘Mind keep still,’ said, ‘or I might chunk bit spade.’ Then said-- ‘I confess I absolutely insensible dramatic interest situation. My curiosity excited. I I like know nephew happened buried. But tell would rather not. I suppose force used?’ ‘Only moral force,’ said Alice. They used talk lot moral force High School went, case know means I tell making people want to, slanging them, laughing them, promising things good. ‘Only moral force, eh?’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle. ‘Well?’ ‘Well,’ Dora said, ‘I sorry happened Albert--I would rather one us. It would turn go tunnel, I like worms, let off. You see digging treasure.’ ‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘and I think coming underground passage leads secret hoard, tunnel fell Albert. He _is_ unlucky,’ sighed. Then Albert-next-door began scream again, uncle wiped face--his face, Albert’s--with silk handkerchief, put trousers pocket. It seems strange place put handkerchief, coat waistcoat I suppose wanted handkerchief handy. Digging warm work. He told Albert-next-door drop it, would proceed matter, Albert stopped screaming, presently uncle finished digging out. Albert look funny, hair dusty velvet suit covered mould face muddy earth crying. We said sorry were, would say word back us. He awfully sick think would one buried, might well one us. I felt hard lines. ‘So digging treasure,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle, wiping face handkerchief. ‘Well, I fear chances success small. I made careful study whole subject. What I know buried treasure worth knowing. And I never knew one coin buried one garden--and generally--Hullo--what that?’ He pointed something shining hole dragged Albert of. Oswald picked up. It half-crown. We looked other, speechless surprise delight, like books. ‘Well, lucky, events,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle. ‘Let us see, fivepence you.’ ‘It fourpence--something; I cannot fractions,’ said Dicky; ‘there seven us, see.’ ‘Oh, count Albert one occasion, eh?’ ‘Of course,’ said Alice; ‘and I say, buried all. Why let odd something is, fourpence each.’ We agreed this, told Albert-next-door would bring share soon could get half-crown changed. He cheered little that, uncle wiped face again--he look hot--and began put coat waistcoat. When done stooped picked something. He held up, hardly believe it, quite true--it another half-crown! ‘To think two!’ said; ‘in experience buried treasure I never heard thing!’ I wish Albert-next-door’s uncle would come treasure-seeking us regularly; must sharp eyes: Dora says looking minute place second half-crown picked from, _she_ never saw it. CHAPTER 3. BEING DETECTIVES The next thing happened us interesting. It real half-crowns--not pretending. I shall try write like real book I can. Of course read Mr Sherlock Holmes, well yellow-covered books pictures outside badly printed; get fourpence-halfpenny bookstall corners beginning curl get dirty, people looking see story ends waiting trains. I think unfair boy bookstall. The books written gentleman named Gaboriau, Albert’s uncle says worst translations world--and written vile English. Of course like Kipling, jolly good stories. And reading book Dick Diddlington--that right name, I know libel actions, I shall say name really, books rot. Only put heads I going narrate. It September, go seaside expensive, even go Sheerness, tin cans old boots sand all. But every one else went, even people next door--not Albert’s side, other. Their servant told Eliza going Scarborough, next day sure enough blinds shutters up, milk left more. There big horse-chestnut tree garden ours, useful getting conkers making stuff rub chilblains. This prevented seeing whether blinds back well, Dicky climbed top tree looked, were. It jolly hot weather, stuffy indoors--we used play good deal garden. We made tent kitchen clothes-horse blankets beds, though quite hot tent house different sort hotness. Albert’s uncle called Turkish Bath. It nice kept seaside, know much thankful for. We might poor little children living crowded alley even summer noon hardly ray sunlight penetrates; clothed rags bare feet--though I mind holes clothes myself, bare feet would bad sort weather. Indeed do, sometimes, playing things require it. It shipwrecked mariners day, I remember, blanket tent. We finished eating things saved, peril lives, st-sinking vessel. They rather nice things. Two-pennyworth coconut candy--it got Greenwich, four ounces penny--three apples, macaroni--the straight sort useful suck things through--some raw rice, large piece cold suet pudding Alice nicked larder went get rice macaroni. And finished one said-- ‘I like detective.’ I wish quite fair, I cannot remember exactly said it. Oswald thinks said it, Dora says Dicky, Oswald much man quarrel little thing like that. ‘I like detective,’ said--perhaps Dicky, I think not--‘and find strange hidden crimes.’ ‘You much cleverer are,’ said H. O. ‘Not very,’ Alice said, ‘because read books know things mean: red hair handle knife, grains white powder velvet collar villain’s overcoat. I believe could it.’ ‘I like anything murders,’ said Dora; ‘somehow seem safe--’ ‘And always ends poor murderer hanged,’ said Alice. We explained murderers hanged, said, ‘I care. I sure one would ever murdering _twice_. Think blood things, would see woke night! I mind detective lie wait gang coiners, now, spring upon unawares, secure them--single-handed, know, faithful bloodhound.’ She stroked Pincher’s ears, gone sleep knew well enough suet pudding finished. He sensible dog. ‘You always get hold wrong end stick,’ Oswald said. ‘You cannot choose crimes detective about. You get suspicious circumstance, look clue follow up. Whether turns murder missing fluke.’ ‘That one way,’ Dicky said. ‘Another get paper find two advertisements bits news fit. Like this: “Young Lady Missing,” tells clothes on, gold locket wore, colour hair, that; another piece paper see, “Gold locket found,” comes out.’ We sent H. O. paper once, could make things fit in. The two best burglars broke place Holloway made preserved tongues invalid delicacies, carried lot them. And another page was, ‘Mysterious deaths Holloway.’ Oswald thought something it, Albert’s uncle asked him, others thought not, Oswald agreed drop it. Besides, Holloway long way off. All time talking paper Alice seemed thinking something else, done said-- ‘I believe might detectives ourselves, I like get anybody trouble.’ ‘Not murderers robbers?’ Dicky asked. ‘It would murderers,’ said; ‘but I _have_ noticed something strange. Only I feel little frightened. Let us ask Albert’s uncle first.’ Alice jolly sight fond asking grown-up people things. And said tommyrot, tell us. ‘Well, promise anything without me,’ Alice said, promised. Then said-- ‘This dark secret, one thinks better involved career crime-discovery better go away ere yet late.’ So Dora said enough tents, going look shops. H. O. went twopence spend. They thought game Alice’s Oswald knew way spoke. He nearly always tell. And people telling truth Oswald generally knows way look eyes. Oswald proud able this. He knows merit much cleverer people. When gone, rest us got closer together said-- ‘Now then.’ ‘Well,’ Alice said, ‘you know house next door? The people gone Scarborough. And house shut up. But last night _I saw light windows_.’ We asked when, room front, could possibly seen. And said-- ‘I tell boys promise ever go fishing without me.’ So promise. Then said-- ‘It last night. I forgotten feed rabbits I woke remembered it. And I afraid I find dead morning, like Oswald did.’ ‘It fault,’ Oswald said; ‘there something matter beasts. I fed right enough.’ Alice said mean that, went on-- ‘I came garden, I saw light house, dark figures moving about. I thought perhaps burglars, Father come home, Eliza gone bed, I could anything. Only I thought perhaps I would tell rest you.’ ‘Why tell us morning?’ Noel asked. And Alice explained want get one trouble, even burglars. ‘But might watch to-night,’ said, ‘and see see light again.’ ‘They might burglars,’ Noel said. He sucking last bit macaroni. ‘You know people next door grand. They know us--and go real private carriage sometimes. And “At Home” day, people come cabs. I daresay piles plate jewellery rich brocades, furs price things like that. Let us keep watch to-night.’ ‘It use watching to-night,’ Dicky said; ‘if burglars come again. But things besides burglars discovered empty houses lights seen moving.’ ‘You mean coiners,’ said Oswald once. ‘I wonder reward setting police track?’ Dicky thought ought something fat, coiners always desperate gang; machinery make coins heavy handy knocking detectives. Then tea-time, went in; Dora H. O. clubbed money together bought melon; quite big one, little bit squashy one end. It good, washed seeds made things pins cotton. And nobody said watching house next door. Only went bed Dicky took coat waistcoat, stopped braces, said-- ‘What coiners?’ Oswald taken collar tie, going say same, said, ‘Of course I meant watch, collar’s rather tight, I thought I would take first.’ Dicky said think girls ought it, might danger, Oswald reminded promised Alice, promise sacred thing, even would much rather not. So Oswald got Alice alone pretence showing caterpillar--Dora like them, screamed ran away Oswald offered show her. Then Oswald explained, Alice agreed come watch could. This made us later ought been, Alice wait till Dora quiet creep slowly, fear boards creaking. The girls sleep room-door open fear burglars. Alice kept clothes nightgown Dora looking, presently got down, creeping past Father’s study, glass door leads veranda iron steps garden. And went quietly, got chestnut-tree; I felt playing Albert’s uncle calls favourite instrument--I mean Fool. For house next door dark dark. Then suddenly heard sound--it came gate end garden. All gardens gates; lead kind lane runs behind them. It sort back way, convenient want say exactly going. We heard gate end next garden click, Dicky nudged Alice would fallen tree Oswald’s extraordinary presence mind. Oswald squeezed Alice’s arm tight, looked; others rather frightened really exactly expected anything happen except perhaps light. But muffled figure, shrouded dark cloak, came swiftly path next-door garden. And could see cloak figure carried mysterious burden. The figure dressed look like woman sailor hat. We held breath passed tree were, tapped gently back door let in, light appeared window downstairs back breakfast-room. But shutters up. Dicky said, ‘My eye!’ would others sick think this! But Alice half like it--and girl I blame her. Indeed, I thought first perhaps would better retire present, return later strongly armed force. ‘It burglars,’ Alice whispered; ‘the mysterious stranger bringing things in, taking out. They must coiners--and oh, Oswald!--do let us! The things coin must hurt much. Do let us go bed!’ But Dicky said going see; reward finding things like would like reward. ‘They locked back door,’ whispered, ‘I heard go. And I could look quite well holes shutters back wall long would got door open, even started once.’ There holes top shutters shape hearts, yellow light came well chinks shutters. Oswald said Dicky went should, eldest; Alice said, ‘If one goes ought me, I thought it.’ So Oswald said, ‘Well, go then’; said, ‘Not anything!’ And begged us to, talked tree till quite hoarse whispering. At last decided plan action. Alice stay tree, scream ‘Murder!’ anything happened. Dicky I get next garden take turns peep. So got quietly could, tree made much noise day, several times paused, fearing discovered. But nothing happened. There pile red flower-pots window one large one window-ledge. It seemed hand Destiny placed there, geranium dead, nothing stop standing it--so Oswald did. He went first eldest, though Dicky tried stop thought first could be, account able say anything. So Oswald stood flower-pot tried look one holes. He really expect see coiners fell work, though pretended talking tree. But seen pouring base molten metal tin moulds shape half-crowns would half astonished spectacle revealed. At first could see little, hole unfortunately made little high, eye detective could see Prodigal Son shiny frame opposite wall. But Oswald held window-frame stood tiptoe _saw_. There furnace, base metal, bearded men leathern aprons tongs things, table table-cloth supper, tin salmon lettuce bottled beer. And chair cloak hat mysterious stranger, two people sitting table two youngest grown-up daughters lady next door, one saying-- ‘So I got salmon three-halfpence cheaper, lettuces six penny Broadway, fancy! We must save much ever housekeeping money want go away decent next year.’ And said, ‘I wish could _all_ go _every_ year, else--Really, I almost wish--’ And time Oswald looking Dicky pulling jacket make get let Dicky squint. And said ‘I almost,’ Dicky pulled hard Oswald felt toppling giddy verge big flower-pots. Putting forth strength hero strove recover equi-what is-its-name, lost beyond recall. ‘You done time!’ said, fell heavily among flower-pots piled below. He heard crash rattle crack, head struck iron pillar used holding next-door veranda. His eyes closed knew more. Now perhaps expect moment Alice would cried ‘Murder!’ If think little know girls are. Directly left alone tree made bolt tell Albert’s uncle bring rescue case coiner’s gang desperate one. And I fell, Albert’s uncle getting wall. Alice never screamed Oswald fell, Dicky thinks heard Albert’s uncle say, ‘Confound kids!’ would kind polite, I hope say it. The people next door come see row was. Albert’s uncle wait come out. He picked Oswald carried insensible body gallant young detective wall, laid top, climbed bore lifeless burden house put sofa Father’s study. Father out, need _crept_ getting garden. Then Oswald restored consciousness, head tied up, sent bed, next day lump young brow big turkey’s egg, uncomfortable. Albert’s uncle came next day talked us separately. To Oswald said many unpleasant things ungentlemanly spy ladies, minding business; I began tell I heard told shut up, altogether made uncomfortable bump did. Oswald say anything one, next day, shadows eve falling, crept away, wrote piece paper, ‘I want speak you,’ shoved hole like heart top next-door shutters. And youngest young lady put eye heart-shaped hole, opened shutter said ‘Well?’ crossly. Then Oswald said-- ‘I sorry, I beg pardon. We wanted detectives, thought gang coiners infested house, looked window last night. I saw lettuce, I heard said salmon three-halfpence cheaper, I know dishonourable pry people’s secrets, especially ladies’, I never forgive once.’ Then lady frowned laughed, said-- ‘So tumbling flower-pots last night? We thought burglars. It frightened us horribly. Why, bump poor head!’ And talked bit, presently said sister wished people know home, because--And stopped short grew red, I said, ‘I thought Scarborough; servant told Eliza so. Why want people know home?’ The lady got redder still, laughed said-- ‘Never mind reason why. I hope head hurt much. Thank nice, manly little speech. _You’ve_ nothing ashamed of, rate.’ Then kissed me, I mind. And said, ‘Run away now, dear. I going to--I going pull blinds open shutters, I want _once_, gets dark, every one see home, Scarborough.’ CHAPTER 4. GOOD HUNTING When got four shillings digging treasure ought, rights, tried Dicky’s idea answering advertisement ladies gentlemen spare time two pounds week, several things rather wanted. Dora wanted new pair scissors, said going get eight-pence. But Alice said-- ‘You ought get those, Oswald, know broke points getting marble brass thimble.’ It quite true, though I almost forgotten it, H. O. jammed marble thimble first all. So I said-- ‘It H. O.’s fault much mine, anyhow. Why pay?’ Oswald much mind paying beastly scissors, hates injustice every kind. ‘He little kid,’ said Dicky, course H. O. said little kid, nearly came row them. But Oswald knows generous; said-- ‘Look here! I pay sixpence scissors, H. O. shall pay rest, teach careful.’ H. O. agreed: mean kid, I found afterwards Alice paid share money. Then wanted new paints, Noel wanted pencil halfpenny account-book write poetry with, seem hard never apples. So, somehow nearly money got spent, agreed must let advertisement run loose little longer. ‘I hope,’ Alice said, ‘that got ladies gentlemen want got money write sample instructions.’ And I little afraid myself, seemed splendid chance; looked paper every day, advertisement always there, thought right. Then detective try-on--and proved go; then, money gone, except halfpenny mine twopence Noel’s three-pence Dicky’s pennies girls left, held another council. Dora sewing buttons H. O.’s Sunday things. He got knife money, cut every single one best buttons off. You idea many buttons suit. Dora counted them. There twenty-four, counting little ones sleeves undo. Alice trying teach Pincher beg; much sense knows got nothing hands, rest us roasting potatoes fire. We made fire purpose, though rather warm. They good cut away burnt parts--but ought wash first, dirty boy. ‘Well, do?’ said Dicky. ‘You fond saying “Let us something!” never saying what.’ ‘We cannot try advertisement yet. Shall try rescuing one?’ said Oswald. It idea, insist it, though next eldest, knows bad manners make people want, would rather not. ‘What Noel’s plan?’ Alice asked. ‘A Princess poetry book,’ said Noel sleepily. He lying back sofa, kicking legs. ‘Only I shall look Princess myself. But I let see married.’ ‘Have got enough poetry make book?’ Dicky asked that, rather sensible him, Noel came look seven poems us could understand. There ‘Wreck Malabar’, poem wrote Eliza took us hear Reviving Preacher, everybody cried, Father said must Preacher’s Eloquence. So Noel wrote: O Eloquence art thou? Ay art thou? cried And everybody cried inside When came eyes red-- And Father said. But Noel told Alice got first line half book boy school going write time. Besides ‘Lines Dead Black Beetle poisoned’-- O Beetle I weep see Thee lying thy poor back! It sad indeed. You shiny black. I wish alive But Eliza says wishing nonsense shame. It good beetle poison, hundreds lying dead--but Noel wrote piece poetry one them. He said time all, worst know one would written to--so Alice could bury beetle put lines grave, though wanted much. Well, quite plain enough poetry book. ‘We might wait year two,’ said Noel. ‘I shall sure make time. I thought piece fly morning knew condensed milk sticky.’ ‘But want money _now_,’ said Dicky, ‘and go writing same. It come time other.’ ‘There poetry newspapers,’ said Alice. ‘Down, Pincher! never clever dog, good trying.’ ‘Do pay it?’ Dicky thought that; often thinks things really important, even little dull. ‘I know. But I think one would let print poetry without. I would I know.’ That Dora; Noel said would mind get paid, long saw poetry printed name end. ‘We might try, anyway,’ said Oswald. He always willing give people’s ideas fair trial. So copied ‘The Wreck Malabar’ six poems drawing-paper--Dora it, writes best--and Oswald drew picture Malabar going hands. It full-rigged schooner, ropes sails correct; cousin Navy, showed me. We thought long time whether would write letter send post poetry--and Dora thought would best. But Noel said could bear know paper would print poetry, So decided take it. I went Noel, I eldest, old enough go London himself. Dicky said poetry rot--and glad got make fool himself. That enough money go us. H. O. could come either, came station see us off, waved cap called ‘Good hunting!’ train started. There lady spectacles corner. She writing pencil edges long strips paper print them. When train started asked-- ‘What said?’ So Oswald answered-- ‘It “Good hunting”--it Jungle Book!’ ‘That pleasant hear,’ lady said; ‘I pleased meet people know Jungle Book. And to--the Zoological Gardens look Bagheera?’ We pleased, too, meet one knew Jungle Book. So Oswald said-- ‘We going restore fallen fortunes House Bastable--and thought different ways--and going try all. Noel’s way poetry. I suppose great poets get paid?’ The lady laughed--she awfully jolly--and said sort poet, too, long strips paper proofs new book stories. Because book made real book pages cover, sometimes print strips paper, writer make marks pencil show printers idiots understand writer means printed. We told digging treasure, meant do. Then asked see Noel’s poetry--and said like--so said, ‘Look here--if show I show mine.’ So agreed. The jolly lady read Noel’s poetry, said liked much. And thought great deal picture Malabar. And said, ‘I write serious poetry like myself; too, I piece I think like boy.’ She gave us--and I copy down, I will, shows grown-up ladies silly others. I like better Noel’s poetry, though I told I not, looked going cry. This wrong, always speak truth, however unhappy makes people. And I generally do. But I want crying railway carriage. The lady’s piece poetry: Oh I wake bed And see sun fat red, I glad another day For different kinds play. There many things do-- The things make man you, If grown-ups get vexed And wonder next. I often wonder whether Ever made kinds play-- If always good gold And told. They like best play tops And toys boxes, bought shops; They even know names Of really interesting games. They let play fire Or trip sister wire, They grudge tea-tray drum, Or booby-traps callers come. They like fishing, true You sometimes soak suit two: They look fireworks, though dry, With quite disapproving eye. They understand way To get day: They know hunger feels Nor need meals. And sent bed night, They happy, polite. For door hear say: ‘_He’s_ done _his_ mischief day!’ She told us lot pieces I cannot remember them, talked us way up, got nearly Cannon Street said-- ‘I got two new shillings here! Do think would help smooth path Fame?’ Noel said, ‘Thank you,’ going take shilling. But Oswald, always remembers told, said-- ‘Thank much, Father told us ought never take anything strangers.’ ‘That nasty one,’ said lady--she talk bit like real lady, like jolly sort grown-up boy dress hat--‘a nasty one! But think Noel I poets I might considered sort relation? You heard brother poets, you? Do think Noel I aunt nephew poets, relationship kind?’ I know say, went on-- ‘It awfully straight stick Father tells you, look here, take shillings, card. When get home tell Father it, says No, bring shillings back me.’ So took shillings, shook hands us said, ‘Good-bye, good hunting!’ We tell Father it, said right, looked card told us highly honoured, lady wrote better poetry lady alive now. We never heard her, seemed much jolly poet. Good old Kipling! We owe two shillings, well Jungle books! CHAPTER 5. THE POET AND THE EDITOR It bad sport--being London entirely hook. We asked way Fleet Street, Father says newspaper offices are. They said straight Ludgate Hill--but turned quite another way. At least _we_ go straight on. We got St Paul’s. Noel _would_ go in, saw Gordon buried--at least monument. It flat, considering man was. When came walked long way, asked policeman said would better go back Smithfield. So did. They burn people now, rather dull, besides long way, Noel got tired. He peaky little chap; comes poet, I think. We bun two different shops--out shillings--and quite late afternoon got Fleet Street. The gas lighted electric lights. There jolly Bovril sign comes different coloured lamps. We went Daily Recorder office, asked see Editor. It big office, bright, brass mahogany electric lights. They told us Editor there, another office. So went dirty street, dull-looking place. There man inside, glass case, museum, told us write names business. So Oswald wrote-- OSWALD BASTABLE NOEL BASTABLE BUSINESS VERY PRIVATE INDEED Then waited stone stairs; draughty. And man glass case looked us museum instead him. We waited long time, boy came said-- ‘The Editor cannot see you. Will please write business?’ And laughed. I wanted punch head. But Noel said, ‘Yes, I write give pen ink, sheet paper envelope.’ The boy said would better write post. But Noel bit pig-headed; worst fault. So said--‘No, I write _now_.’ So I backed saying-- ‘Look price penny stamps since coal strike!’ So boy grinned, man glass case gave us pen paper, Noel wrote. Oswald writes better does; Noel would it; took long time, inky. DEAR MR EDITOR, I want print poetry pay it, I friend Mrs Leslie’s; poet too. Your affectionate friend, NOEL BASTABLE. He licked envelope good deal, boy read going upstairs; wrote ‘Very private’ outside, gave letter boy. I thought good; minute grinning boy came back, quite respectful, said--‘The Editor says, please step up?’ We stepped up. There lot stairs passages, queer sort humming, hammering sound funny smell. The boy polite, said ink smelt, noise printing machines. After going lot cold passages came door; boy opened it, let us go in. There large room, big, soft, blue-and-red carpet, roaring fire, though October; large table drawers, littered papers, like one Father’s study. A gentleman sitting one side table; light moustache light eyes, looked young editor--not nearly old Father. He looked tired sleepy, got early morning; kind, liked him. Oswald thought looked clever. Oswald considered judge faces. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘so Mrs Leslie’s friends?’ ‘I think so,’ said Noel; ‘at least gave us shilling, wished us “good hunting!”’ ‘Good hunting, eh? Well, poetry yours? Which poet?’ I cannot think could asked! Oswald said manly-looking boy age. However, I thought would look duffing offended, I said-- ‘This brother Noel. He poet.’ Noel turned quite pale. He disgustingly like girl ways. The Editor told us sit down, took poems Noel, began read them. Noel got paler paler; I really thought going faint, like I held hand cold-water tap, I accidentally cut chisel. When Editor read first poem--it one beetle--he got stood back us. It manners; Noel thinks ‘to conceal emotion,’ books. He read poems, said-- ‘I like poetry much, young man. I give you--let see; much shall I give it?’ ‘As much ever can,’ said Noel. ‘You see I want good deal money restore fallen fortunes house Bastable.’ The gentleman put eye-glasses looked hard us. Then sat down. ‘That good idea,’ said he. ‘Tell came think it. And, I say, tea? They sent mine.’ He rang tingly bell, boy brought tray teapot thick cup saucer things, fetch another tray us, told to; tea Editor Daily Recorder. I suppose proud moment Noel, though I think till afterwards. The Editor asked us lot questions, told good deal, though course I tell stranger reasons thinking family fortunes wanted restoring. We stayed half hour, going away said again-- ‘I shall print poems, poet; think worth?’ ‘I know,’ Noel said. ‘You see I write sell.’ ‘Why write then?’ asked. Noel said know; supposed wanted to. ‘Art Art’s sake, eh?’ said Editor, seemed quite delighted, though Noel said something clever. ‘Well, would guinea meet views?’ asked. I read people loss words, dumb emotion, I read people turned stone astonishment, joy, something, I never knew silly looked till I saw Noel standing staring Editor mouth open. He went red went white, got crimson, rubbing crimson lake palette. But say word, Oswald say-- ‘I jolly well think so.’ So Editor gave Noel sovereign shilling, shook hands us both, thumped Noel back said-- ‘Buck up, old man! It first guinea, last. Now go along home, ten years bring poetry. Not before--see? I taking poetry I like much; put poetry paper all. I shall put another paper I know of.’ ‘What _do_ put paper?’ I asked, Father always takes Daily Chronicle, I know Recorder like. We chose glorious office, clock outside lighted up. ‘Oh, news,’ said he, ‘and dull articles, things Celebrities. If know Celebrities, now?’ Noel asked Celebrities were. ‘Oh, Queen Princes, people titles, people write, sing, act--or something clever wicked.’ ‘I know anybody wicked,’ said Oswald, wishing known Dick Turpin, Claude Duval, able tell Editor things them. ‘But I know one title--Lord Tottenham.’ ‘The mad old Protectionist, eh? How come know him?’ ‘We know speak to. But goes Heath every day three, strides along like giant--with black cloak like Lord Tennyson’s flying behind him, talks like one clock.’ ‘What say?’ The Editor sat again, fiddling blue pencil. ‘We heard once, close enough understand, said, “The curse country, sir--ruin desolation!” And went striding along again, hitting furze-bushes heads enemies.’ ‘Excellent descriptive touch,’ said Editor. ‘Well, go on.’ ‘That I know him, except stops middle Heath every day, looks round see one about, not, takes collar off.’ The Editor interrupted--which considered rude--and said-- ‘You romancing?’ ‘I beg pardon?’ said Oswald. ‘Drawing long bow, I mean,’ said Editor. Oswald drew up, said liar. The Editor laughed, said romancing lying same; important know playing at. So Oswald accepted apology, went on. ‘We hiding among furze-bushes one day, saw it. He took collar, put clean one, threw among furze-bushes. We picked afterwards, beastly paper one!’ ‘Thank you,’ said Editor, got put hand pocket. ‘That well worth five shillings, are. Would like see round printing offices go home?’ I pocketed five bob, thanked him, I said like much. He called another gentleman said something could hear. Then said good-bye again; time Noel said word. But said, ‘I made poem you. It called “Lines Noble Editor.” Shall I write down?’ The Editor gave blue pencil, sat Editor’s table wrote. It this, told afterwards well could remember-- May Life’s choicest blessings lot I think ought blest For going print poems-- And may one well rest. ‘Thank you,’ said Editor. ‘I think I ever poem addressed before. I shall treasure it, I assure you.’ Then gentleman said something Maecenas, went see printing office least one pound seven pockets. It _was_ good hunting, mistake! But never put Noel’s poetry Daily Recorder. It quite long time afterwards saw sort story thing magazine, station bookstall, kind, sleepy-looking Editor written it, I suppose. It amusing. It said lot Noel me, describing us wrong, saying tea Editor; Noel’s poems story thing. I think Editor seemed make game them, Noel quite pleased see printed--so right. It poetry anyhow, I glad say. CHAPTER 6. NOEL’S PRINCESS She happened quite accidentally. We looking Princess then; Noel said going find Princess himself; marry her--and really did. Which rather odd, people say things going befall, often not. It different, course, prophets old. We get treasure it, except twelve chocolate drops; might done, adventure, anyhow. Greenwich Park jolly good place play in, especially parts near Greenwich. The parts near Heath first-rate. I often wish Park nearer house; I suppose Park difficult thing move. Sometimes get Eliza put lunch basket, go Park. She likes that--it saves cooking dinner us; sometimes says accord, ‘I made pasties you, might well go Park not. It lovely day.’ She always tells us rinse cup drinking-fountain, girls do; I always put head tap drink. Then intrepid hunter mountain stream--and besides, sure clean. Dicky same, H. O. But Noel always drinks cup. He says golden goblet wrought enchanted gnomes. The day Princess happened fine, hot day, last October, quite tired walk Park. We always go little gate top Croom’s Hill. It postern gate things always happen stories. It dusty walking, got Park ripping, rested bit, lay backs, looked trees, wished could play monkeys. I done now, Park-keeper makes row catches you. When would rested little, Alice said-- ‘It long way enchanted wood, nice there. I wonder shall find it?’ ‘We shall find deer,’ said Dicky, ‘if go look; go side Park people buns.’ Saying buns made us think lunch, it; done scratched hole tree buried papers, know spoils pretty places leave beastly, greasy papers lying about. I remember Mother teaching Dora that, quite little. I wish everybody’s parents would teach useful lesson, orange peel. When would eaten everything was, Alice whispered-- ‘I see white witch bear yonder among trees! Let us track slay lair.’ ‘I bear,’ said Noel; crept away, followed among trees. Often witch bear sight, know would jump from; sometimes saw it, followed. ‘When catch great fight,’ said Oswald; ‘and I shall Count Folko Mont Faucon.’ ‘I Gabrielle,’ said Dora. She one us likes girl’s parts. ‘I Sintram,’ said Alice; ‘and H. O. Little Master.’ ‘What Dicky?’ ‘Oh, I Pilgrim bones.’ ‘Hist!’ whispered Alice. ‘See white fairy fur gleaming amid yonder covert!’ And I saw bit white too. It Noel’s collar, come undone back. We hunted bear trees, lost altogether; suddenly found wall Park--in place I sure wall before. Noel anywhere about, door wall. And open; went through. ‘The bear hidden mountain fastnesses,’ Oswald said. ‘I draw good sword him.’ So I drew umbrella, Dora always bring case rains, Noel gets cold chest least thing--and went on. The side wall stable yard, cobble-stones. There nobody about--but could hear man rubbing horse hissing stable; crept quietly past, Alice whispered-- ‘It Is lair Monster Serpent; I hear deadly hiss! Beware! Courage despatch!’ We went stones tiptoe, found another wall another door side. We went too, tiptoe. It really adventure. And shrubbery, saw something white trees. Dora said white bear. That like Dora. She always begins take part play rest us getting tired it. I mean unkindly, I fond Dora. I cannot forget kind I bronchitis; ingratitude dreadful vice. But quite true. ‘It bear,’ said Oswald; went on, still tiptoe, round twisty path lawn, Noel. His collar come undone, I said, inky mark face made left house, would let Dora wash off, one bootlaces coming down. He standing looking little girl; funniest little girl ever saw. She like china doll--the sixpenny kind; white face, long yellow hair, done tight two pigtails; forehead big lumpy, cheeks came high up, like little shelves eyes. Her eyes small blue. She funny black frock, curly braid it, button boots went almost knees. Her legs thin. She sitting hammock chair nursing blue kitten--not sky-blue one, course, colour new slate pencil. As came heard say Noel--‘Who you?’ Noel forgotten bear, taking favourite part, said--‘I Prince Camaralzaman.’ The funny little girl looked pleased-- ‘I thought first common boy,’ said. Then saw rest us said-- ‘Are Princesses Princes too?’ Of course said ‘Yes,’ said-- ‘I Princess also.’ She said well too, exactly true. We glad, seldom meet children begin play right without everything explained them. And even say going ‘pretend be’ lion, witch, king. Now little girl said ‘I _am_ Princess.’ Then looked Oswald said, ‘I fancy I seen Baden.’ Of course Oswald said, ‘Very likely.’ The little girl funny voice, words quite plain, word itself; talk like do. H. O. asked cat’s name was, said ‘Katinka.’ Then Dicky said-- ‘Let us get away windows; play near windows one inside generally knocks says “Do not”.’ The Princess put cat carefully said-- ‘I forbidden walk grass.’ ‘That pity,’ said Dora. ‘But I like,’ said Princess. ‘You must things forbidden do,’ Dora said; Dicky showed us grass beyond shrubs gravel path between. So I lifted Princess gravel, able say walked grass. When got grass sat down, Princess asked us liked ‘dragees’ (I know spell it, I asked Albert-next-door’s uncle). We said thought not, pulled real silver box pocket showed us; flat, round chocolates. We two each. Then asked name, began, began went on, on, on, till I thought never going stop. H. O. said fifty names, Dicky good figures, says eighteen. The first Pauline, Alexandra, Alice, Mary one, Victoria, heard that, ended Hildegarde Cunigonde something other, Princess something else. When would done, H. O. said, ‘That jolly good! Say again!’ did, even could remember it. We told names, thought short, Noel’s turn said Prince Noel Camaralzaman Ivan Constantine Charlemagne James John Edward Biggs Maximilian Bastable Prince Lewisham, asked say course could get first two names right, would made went on. So Princess said, ‘You quite old enough know name.’ She grave serious. She told us fifth cousin Queen Victoria. We asked cousins were, seem understand. She went said seven times removed. She could tell us meant either, Oswald thinks means Queen’s cousins fond keep coming bothering, Queen’s servants orders remove them. This little girl must fond Queen try often see her, seven times removed. We could see considered something proud of; thought hard Queen cousins would let alone. Presently little girl asked us maids governesses were. We told now. And said-- ‘How pleasant! And come alone?’ ‘Yes,’ said Dora; ‘we came across Heath.’ ‘You fortunate,’ said little girl. She sat upright grass, fat little hands lap. ‘I like go Heath. There donkeys there, white saddle covers. I like ride them, governess permit.’ ‘I glad governess,’ H. O. said. ‘We ride donkeys whenever pennies, I gave man another penny make gallop.’ ‘You indeed fortunate!’ said Princess again, looked sad shelves cheeks showed ever. You could laid sixpence quite safely one. ‘Never mind,’ said Noel; ‘I got lot money. Come ride now.’ But little girl shook head said afraid would correct. Dora said quite right; sudden came one uncomfortable times nobody think anything say, sat looked other. But last Alice said ought going. ‘Do go yet,’ little girl said. ‘At time order carriage?’ ‘Our carriage fairy one, drawn griffins, comes wish it,’ said Noel. The little girl looked queerly, said, ‘That picture-book.’ Then Noel said thought time married home time tea. The little girl rather stupid it, told her, married Dora’s pocket-handkerchief veil, ring back one buttons H. O.’s blouse went little finger. Then showed play cross-touch, puss corner, tag. It funny, know games battledore shuttlecock les graces. But really began laugh last look quite like doll. She Puss running Dicky suddenly stopped short looked going cry. And looked too, two prim ladies little mouths tight hair. One said quite awful voice, ‘Pauline, children?’ voice gruff; curly R’s. The little girl said Princes Princesses--which silly, grown-up person great friend yours. The gruff lady gave short, horrid laugh, like husky bark, said-- ‘Princes, indeed! They common children!’ Dora turned red began speak, little girl cried ‘Common children! Oh, I glad! When I grown I always play common children.’ And ran us, began kiss us one one, beginning Alice; got H. O. horrid lady said--‘Your Highness--go indoors once!’ The little girl answered, ‘I not!’ Then prim lady said--‘Wilson, carry Highness indoors.’ And little girl carried away screaming, kicking little thin legs buttoned boots, screams shrieked: ‘Common children! I glad, glad, glad! Common children! Common children!’ The nasty lady remarked--‘Go once, I send police!’ So went. H. O. made face Alice, Oswald took cap said sorry annoyed anything; Oswald always taught polite ladies, however nasty. Dicky took off, too, saw it; says first, mistake. If I really common boy I say lie. Then came away, got outside Dora said, ‘So really Princess. Fancy Princess living _there_!’ ‘Even Princesses live somewhere,’ said Dicky. ‘And I thought play. And real. I wish I would known! I liked ask lots things,’ said Alice. H. O. said would liked ask dinner whether crown. I felt, myself, lost chance finding great deal kings queens. I might known stupid-looking little girl would never able pretend, well that. So went home across Heath, made dripping toast tea. When eating Noel said, ‘I wish I could give _her_ some! It good.’ He sighed said it, mouth full, knew thinking Princess. He says beautiful day, remember quite well, nothing kind. CHAPTER 7. BEING BANDITS Noel quite tiresome ever long found Princess. He would keep wanting go Park rest us not, though went several times please him, never found door open again, us except knew first would go. So thought time something rouse stupor despair, always done heroes anything baffling occurred. Besides, getting short money again--the fortunes house cannot restored (not last, is), even one pound eight got ‘good hunting.’ We spent good deal presents Father’s birthday. We got paper-weight, like glass bun, picture Lewisham Church bottom; blotting-pad, box preserved fruits, ivory penholder view Greenwich Park little hole look top. He awfully pleased surprised, heard Noel Oswald earned money buy things surprised still. Nearly rest money went get fireworks Fifth November. We got six Catherine wheels four rockets; two hand-lights, one red one green; sixpenny maroon; two Roman-candles--they cost shilling; Italian streamers, fairy fountain, tourbillon cost eighteen-pence nearly worth it. But I think crackers squibs mistake. It true get lot money, bad fun first two three dozen, get jolly sick let sixpenn’orth. And amusing way allowed: putting fire. It always seems long time till evening got fireworks house, I think rather foggy day decided let directly breakfast, Father said would help us let eight clock dinner, ought never disappoint father help it. You see three good reasons trying H. O.’s idea restoring fallen fortunes house becoming bandits Fifth November. We fourth reason well, best reason lot. You remember Dora thought would wrong bandits. And Fifth November came Dora away Stroud staying godmother. Stroud Gloucestershire. We determined way, think wrong, besides meant anyhow. We held Council, course, laid plans carefully. We let H. O. Captain, idea. Oswald Lieutenant. Oswald quite fair, let H. O. call Captain; Oswald eldest next Dora, all. Our plan this. We go Heath. Our house Lewisham Road, quite close Heath cut short way opposite confectioner’s, past nursery gardens cottage hospital, turn left afterwards right. You come top hill, big guns iron fence round them, bands play Thursday evenings summer. We lurk ambush there, waylay unwary traveller. We call upon surrender arms, bring home put deepest dungeon castle moat; load chains send friends ransom. You may think chains, wrong, used keep two dogs once, besides Pincher, fall fortunes ancient House Bastable. And quite big dogs. It latish afternoon started. We thought could lurk better nearly dark. It rather foggy, waited good beside railings, belated travellers either grown else Board School children. We going get row grown-up people--especially strangers--and true bandit would ever stoop ask ransom relations poor needy. So thought better wait. As I said, Guy Fawkes Day, never able bandits all, unwary traveller catch forbidden go cold head. But would run follow guy, without even putting coat comforter, damp, foggy afternoon nearly dark, see fault entirely, served jolly well right. We saw coming Heath deciding go home tea. He followed guy right across village (we call Blackheath village; I know why), coming back dragging feet sniffing. ‘Hist, unwary traveller approaches!’ whispered Oswald. ‘Muffle horses’ heads see priming pistols,’ muttered Alice. She always play boys’ parts, makes Ellis cut hair short purpose. Ellis obliging hairdresser. ‘Steal softly upon him,’ said Noel; ‘for lo! ‘it dusk, human eyes mark deeds.’ So ran surrounded unwary traveller. It turned Albert-next-door, frightened indeed saw were. ‘Surrender!’ hissed Oswald, desperate-sounding voice, caught arm Unwary. And Albert-next-door said, ‘All right! I surrendering hard I can. You need pull arm off.’ We explained resistance useless, I think saw first. We held tight arms, marched home hill hollow square five. He wanted tell us guy, made see proper prisoners talk guard, especially guys prisoner told go cold. When got live said, ‘All right, I want tell you. You wish I afterwards. You never saw guy.’ ‘I see _you_!’ said H. O. It rude, Oswald told once, duty elder brother. But H. O. young know better yet, besides bad H. O. Albert-next-door said, ‘You manners, I want go tea. Let go me!’ But Alice told him, quite kindly, going tea, coming us. ‘I not,’ said Albert-next-door; ‘I going home. Leave go! I got bad cold. You making worse.’ Then tried cough, silly, would seen morning, would told us cold go with. When tried cough, said, ‘Leave go me! You see cold’s getting worse.’ ‘You thought before,’ said Dicky; ‘you coming us.’ ‘Do silly,’ said Noel; ‘you know told beginning resistance useless. There disgrace yielding. We five one.’ By time Eliza opened door, thought best take without parlaying. To parley prisoner done bandits. Directly got safe nursery, H. O. began jump say, ‘Now prisoner really truly!’ And Albert-next-door began cry. He always does. I wonder begin long before--but Alice fetched one dried fruits gave Father birthday. It green walnut. I noticed walnuts plums always get left till last box; apricots go first, figs pears; cherries, any. So ate shut up. Then explained position him, mistake, could say afterwards understood. ‘There violence,’ said Oswald--he Captain Bandits, know H. O. likes Chaplain play prisoners--‘no violence. But confined dark, subterranean dungeon toads snakes crawl, little light day filters heavily mullioned windows. You loaded chains. Now begin again, Baby, nothing cry about; straw pallet; beside gaoler set ewer--a ewer jug, stupid; eat you--a ewer water; mouldering crust food.’ But Albert-next-door never enters spirit thing. He mumbled something tea-time. Now Oswald, though stern, always just, besides rather hungry, tea ready. So once, Albert-next-door all--and gave left four-pound jar apricot jam got money Noel got poetry. And saved crusts prisoner. Albert-next-door tiresome. Nobody could nicer prison had. We fenced corner old wire nursery fender chairs, instead putting coal-cellar first intended. And said dog-chains cold girls kind enough warm fetters thoroughly fire put him. We got straw cases bottles wine someone sent Father one Christmas--it years ago, cases quite good. We unpacked carefully pulled pieces scattered straw about. It made lovely straw pallet, took ever long make--but Albert-next-door yet learn gratitude really is. We got bread trencher wooden platter prisoner’s crusts put--they mouldy, could wait till got so, ewer got toilet jug spare-room nobody ever sleeps. And even Albert-next-door could happy like rest us. He howled cried tried get out, knocked ewer stamped mouldering crusts. Luckily water ewer forgotten it, dust spiders. So tied clothes-line back kitchen, hurry up, pity him. We might rescued devoted page tiresome. In fact Noel actually dressing page Albert-next-door kicked prison ewer. We got sheet paper old exercise-book, made H. O. prick thumb, little brother duty teach brave. We none us mind pricking ourselves; done heaps times. H. O. like it, agreed it, I helped little slow, saw red bead blood getting fatter bigger I squeezed thumb pleased, I told would be. This wrote H. O.’s blood, blood gave got ‘Restored’, write rest crimson lake, colour, though I always use it, myself, painting wounds. While Oswald writing heard Alice whispering prisoner would soon over, play. The prisoner left howling, I pretended hear said. A Bandit Captain overlook things sometimes. This letter-- ‘Albert Morrison held prisoner Bandits. On payment three thousand pounds restored sorrowing relatives, forgotten forgiven.’ I sure last part, Dicky certain seen paper, I suppose must right. We let H. O. take letter; fair, blood written with, told leave next door Mrs Morrison. H. O. came back quite quickly, Albert-next-door’s uncle came him. ‘What this, Albert?’ cried. ‘Alas, alas, nephew! Do I find prisoner desperate band brigands?’ ‘Bandits,’ said H. O; ‘you know says bandits.’ ‘I beg pardon, gentlemen,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle, ‘bandits is, course. This, Albert, direct result pursuit guy occasion doting mother expressly warned forgo pleasures chase.’ Albert said fault, wanted play. ‘So ho!’ said uncle, ‘impenitent too! Where dungeon?’ We explained dungeon, showed straw pallet ewer mouldering crusts things. ‘Very pretty complete,’ said. ‘Albert, highly privileged ever I was. No one ever made nice dungeon I age. I think I better leave are.’ Albert began cry said sorry, would good boy. ‘And old familiar basis expect ransom you, you? Honestly, nephew, I doubt whether worth it. Besides, sum mentioned document strikes excessive: Albert really _not_ worth three thousand pounds. Also strange unfortunate chance I money me. Could take less?’ We said perhaps could. ‘Say eightpence,’ suggested Albert-next-door’s uncle, ‘which small change I happen person.’ ‘Thank much,’ said Alice held out; ‘but sure spare it? Because really play.’ ‘Quite sure. Now, Albert, game over. You better run home mother tell much enjoyed yourself.’ When Albert-next-door gone uncle sat Guy Fawkes armchair took Alice knee, sat round fire waiting till would time let fireworks. We roasted chestnuts sent Dicky for, told us stories till nearly seven. His stories first-rate--he parts different voices. At last said-- ‘Look here, young-uns. I like see play enjoy yourselves, I think hurts Albert enjoy too.’ ‘I think much,’ said H. O. But I knew Albert-next-door’s uncle meant I much older H. O. He went on-- ‘But Albert’s mother? Did think anxious would coming home? As happens I saw come you, knew right. But I not, eh?’ He talks like serious, even angry. Other times talks like people books--to us, I mean. We none us said anything. But I thinking. Then Alice spoke. Girls seem mind saying things say. She put arms round Albert-next-door’s uncle’s neck said-- ‘We very, sorry. We think mother. You see try hard think people’s mothers because--’ Just heard Father’s key door Albert-next-door’s uncle kissed Alice put down, went meet Father. As went I thought I heard Albert-next-door’s uncle say something sounded like ‘Poor little beggars!’ He could meant us, would jolly time, chestnuts, fireworks look forward dinner everything! CHAPTER 8. BEING EDITORS It Albert’s uncle thought trying newspaper. He said thought find bandit business paying industry, permanency, journalism might be. We sold Noel’s poetry piece information Lord Tottenham good editor, thought would bad idea newspaper own. We saw plainly editors must rich powerful, grand office man glass case, like museum, soft carpets big writing-table. Besides seen whole handful money editor pulled quite carelessly trousers pocket gave five bob. Dora wanted editor Oswald, gave way girl, afterwards knew true says copy-books Virtue Reward. Because idea bother is. Everybody wanted put everything liked, matter much room page. It simply awful! Dora put long could said let alone would go editor; could paper’s editors themselves, there. Then Oswald said, like good brother: ‘I help like, Dora,’ said, ‘You trouble rest them! Come editor see like it. I give you.’ But not, together. We let Albert-next-door sub-editor, hurt foot nail boot gathered. When done Albert-next-door’s uncle copied us typewriting, sent copies friends, course one left could ask buy it. We think late. We called paper Lewisham Recorder; Lewisham live there, Recorder memory good editor. I could write better paper head, editor allowed write paper. It hard, not. You fill get writers. If I ever time I write paper myself. It patchy. We time make illustrated paper, I drew ship going hands first copy. But typewriter cannot draw ships, left copies. The time first paper took write one would believe! This Newspaper: THE LEWISHAM RECORDER EDITORS: DORA AND OSWALD BASTABLE ------------ EDITORIAL NOTE Every paper written reason.

Albert-next-door’s uncle gave us two shillings, all. You cannot restore fallen fortunes two shillings! CHAPTER 9. THE G. B. Being editors best way wealth. We feel now, highwaymen respected like used be. I sure tried best restore fallen fortunes. We felt fall much, knew Bastables rich once. Dora Oswald remember Father always bringing nice things home London, used turkeys geese wine cigars come carrier Christmas-time, boxes candied fruit French plums ornamental boxes silk velvet gilding them. They called prunes, prunes buy grocer’s quite different. But seldom anything nice brought London, turkey prune people forgotten Father’s address. ‘How _can_ restore beastly fallen fortunes?’ said Oswald. ‘We tried digging writing princesses editors.’ ‘And bandits,’ said H. O. ‘When try that?’ asked Dora quickly. ‘You know I told wrong.’ ‘It wrong way it,’ said Alice, quicker still, Oswald could say, ‘Who asked tell us anything it?’ would rude, glad not. ‘We caught Albert-next-door.’ ‘Oh, Albert-next-door!’ said Dora contemptuously, I felt comfortable; even I say, ‘Who asked you, cetera,’ I afraid Dora going come good elder sister us. She jolly sight often. Dicky looked paper reading said, ‘This sounds likely,’ read out-- ‘L100 secures partnership lucrative business sale useful patent. L10 weekly. No personal attendance necessary. Jobbins, 300, Old Street Road.’ ‘I wish could secure partnership,’ said Oswald. He twelve, thoughtful boy age. Alice looked painting. She trying paint fairy queen’s frock green bice, would rub. There something funny green bice. It never rub off; matter expensive paintbox is--and even boiling water little use. She said, ‘Bother bice! And, Oswald, use thinking that. Where get hundred pounds?’ ‘Ten pounds week five pounds us,’ Oswald went on--he done sum head Alice talking--‘because partnership means halves. It would A1.’ Noel sat sucking pencil--he writing poetry usual. I saw first two lines-- I wonder Green Bice Is never nice. Suddenly said, ‘I wish fairy would come chimney drop jewel table--a jewel worth hundred pounds.’ ‘She might well give hundred pounds it,’ said Dora. ‘Or might well give us five pounds week,’ said Alice. ‘Or fifty,’ said I. ‘Or five hundred,’ said Dicky. I saw H. O. open mouth, I knew going say, ‘Or five thousand,’ I said-- ‘Well, give us fivepence, would I always saying, rescue wealthy old gentleman deadly peril would give us pot money, could partnership five pounds week. Five pounds week would buy great many things.’ Then Dicky said, ‘Why borrow it?’ So said, ‘Who from?’ read paper-- MONEY PRIVATELY WITHOUT FEES THE BOND STREET BANK Manager, Z. Rosenbaum. Advances cash L20 L10,000 ladies’ gentlemen’s note hand alone, without security. No fees. No inquiries. Absolute privacy guaranteed. ‘What mean?’ asked H. O. ‘It means kind gentleman lot money, know enough poor people help, puts paper help them, lending money--that it, it, Dicky?’ Dora explained Dicky said, ‘Yes.’ And H. O. said Generous Benefactor, like Miss Edgeworth. Then Noel wanted know note hand was, Dicky knew that, read book, letter saying pay money can, signed name. ‘No inquiries!’ said Alice. ‘Oh--Dicky--do think would?’ ‘Yes, I think so,’ said Dicky. ‘I wonder Father go kind gentleman. I seen name circular Father’s study.’ ‘Perhaps has.’ said Dora. But rest us sure not, because, course, had, would money buy nice things. Just Pincher jumped knocked painting-water. He careless dog. I wonder painting-water always ugly colour? Dora ran duster wipe up, H. O. dropped drops water hands said got plague. So played plague bit, I Arab physician bath-towel turban, cured plague magic acid-drops. After time dinner, dinner talked settled would go see Generous Benefactor next day. But thought perhaps G. B.--it short Generous Benefactor--would like many us. I often noticed worst six--people think six great many, children. That sentence looks wrong somehow. I mean mind six pairs boots, six pounds apples, six oranges, especially equations, seem think ought five brothers sisters. Of course Dicky go, idea. Dora go Blackheath see old lady, friend Father’s, could go. Alice said _she_ ought go, said, ‘Ladies _and_ gentlemen,’ perhaps G. B. would let us money unless kinds us. H. O. said Alice lady; said _he_ going, anyway. Then called disagreeable cat, began cry. But Oswald always tries make quarrels, said-- ‘You little sillies, you!’ And Dora said, ‘Do cry, Alice; meant grown-up lady.’ Then H. O. said, ‘What else think I meant, Disagreeable?’ So Dicky said, ‘Do disagreeable yourself, H. O. Let alone say sorry, I jolly well make you!’ So H. O. said sorry. Then Alice kissed said sorry too; H. O. gave hug, said, ‘Now I _really truly_ sorry,’ So right. Noel went last time us went London, it, Dora said would take Blackheath would take H. O. So would little disagreeableness thought better take him, did. At first thought would tear oldest things bit more, put patches different colours them, show G. B. much wanted money. But Dora said would sort cheating, pretending poorer are. And Dora right sometimes, though elder sister. Then thought would better wear best things, G. B. might see poor could trust us pay money back it. But Dora said would wrong too. So came quite honest, Dora said, going were, without even washing faces hands; I looked H. O. train I wished quite particularly honest. Every one reads knows like go train, I shall tell it--though rather fun, especially part guard came tickets Waterloo, H. O. seat pretended dog without ticket. We went Charing Cross, went round Whitehall see soldiers St James’s reason--and would looked shops bit got Brook Street, Bond Street. It brass plate door next shop--a grand place, sold bonnets hats--all bright smart, tickets tell price. We rang bell boy opened door asked Mr Rosenbaum. The boy polite; ask us in. So Dicky gave visiting card; one Father’s really, name same, Mr Richard Bastable, others wrote names underneath. I happened piece pink chalk pocket wrote that. Then boy shut door faces waited step. But presently came asked business. So Dicky said-- ‘Money advanced, young shaver! day it!’ And made us wait again, till I quite stiff legs, Alice liked looking hats bonnets, last door opened, boy said-- ‘Mr Rosenbaum see you,’ wiped feet mat, said so, went stairs soft carpets room. It beautiful room. I wished put best things, least washed little. But late now. The room velvet curtains soft, soft carpet, full splendid things. Black gold cabinets, china, statues, pictures. There picture cabbage pheasant dead hare like life, I would given worlds own. The fur natural I never tired looking it; Alice liked one girl broken jug best. Then besides pictures clocks candlesticks vases, gilt looking-glasses, boxes cigars scent things littered chairs tables. It wonderful place, middle splendour little old gentleman long black coat long white beard hookey nose--like falcon. And put pair gold spectacles looked us knew exactly much clothes worth. And then, elder ones thinking begin, said ‘Good morning’ came in, course, H. O. began could stop him. He said: ‘Are G. B.?’ ‘The _what_?’ said little old gentleman. ‘The G. B.,’ said H. O., I winked shut up, see me, G. B. did. He waved hand _me_ shut up, I to, H. O. went on--‘It stands Generous Benefactor.’ The old gentleman frowned. Then said, ‘Your Father sent here, I suppose?’ ‘No not,’ said Dicky. ‘Why think so?’ The old gentleman held card, I explained took Father’s name happens Dicky’s. ‘Does know come?’ ‘No,’ said Alice, ‘we shall tell till got partnership, business worries good deal want bother till settled, shall give half share.’ The old gentleman took spectacles rumpled hair hands, said, ‘Then _did_ come for?’ ‘We saw advertisement,’ Dicky said, ‘and want hundred pounds note hand, sister came kinds us; want buy partnership lucrative business sale useful patent. No personal attendance necessary.’ ‘I think I quite follow you,’ said G. B. ‘But one thing I like settled entering fully matter: call Generous Benefactor?’ ‘Well, see,’ said Alice, smiling show frightened, though I know really was, awfully, ‘we thought _very_ kind try find poor people want money help lend money.’ ‘Hum!’ said G. B. ‘Sit down.’ He cleared clocks vases candlesticks chairs, sat down. The chairs velvety, gilt legs. It like king’s palace. ‘Now,’ said, ‘you ought school, instead thinking money. Why you?’ We told go school Father could manage it, meantime wanted something restore fallen fortunes House Bastable. And said thought lucrative patent would good thing. He asked lot questions, told everything think Father would mind telling, last said-- ‘You wish borrow money. When repay it?’ ‘As soon got it, course,’ Dicky said. Then G. B. said Oswald, ‘You seem eldest,’ I explained Dicky’s idea, eldest matter. Then said Dicky--‘You minor, I presume?’ Dicky said yet, thought mining engineer day, going Klondike. ‘Minor, miner,’ said G. B. ‘I mean age?’ ‘I shall ten years, though,’ said Dicky. ‘Then might repudiate loan,’ said G. B., Dicky said ‘What?’ Of course ought said ‘I beg pardon. I quite catch said’--that Oswald would said. It polite ‘What.’ ‘Repudiate loan,’ G. B repeated. ‘I mean might say would pay back money, law could compel so.’ ‘Oh, well, think sneaks,’ said Dicky, got chair. But G. B. said, ‘Sit down, sit down; I joking.’ Then talked more, last said--‘I advise enter partnership. It swindle. Many advertisements are. And I hundred pounds to-day lend you. But I lend pound, spend like. And twenty-one shall pay back.’ ‘I shall pay back long that,’ said Dicky. ‘Thanks, awfully! And note hand?’ ‘Oh,’ said G. B., ‘I trust honour. Between gentlemen, know--and ladies’--he made beautiful bow Alice--‘a word good bond.’ Then took sovereign, held hand talked us. He gave us lot good advice going business young, lessons--just swatting bit, hook, put low form went back school. And time stroking sovereign looking thought beautiful. And was, new one. Then last held Dicky, Dicky put hand G. B. suddenly put sovereign back pocket. ‘No,’ said, ‘I give sovereign. I give fifteen shillings, nice bottle scent. It worth far five shillings I charging it. And, can, shall pay back pound, sixty per cent interest--sixty per cent, sixty per cent.’ ‘What that?’ said H. O. The G. B. said would tell us paid back sovereign, sixty per cent nothing afraid of. He gave Dicky money. And boy made call cab, G. B. put us shook hands us all, asked Alice give kiss, did, H. O. would too, though face dirtier ever. The G. B. paid cabman told station go to, went home. That evening Father letter seven-of clock post. And read came nursery. He look quite unhappy usual, looked grave. ‘You Mr Rosenbaum’s,’ said. So told it. It took long time, Father sat armchair. It jolly. He often come talk us now. He spend time thinking business. And would told said-- ‘You done harm time, children; rather good harm, indeed. Mr Rosenbaum written kind letter.’ ‘Is friend yours, Father?’ Oswald asked. ‘He acquaintance,’ said father, frowning little, ‘we done business together. And letter--’ stopped said: ‘No; harm to-day; I want future anything serious try buy partnership without consulting me, all. I want interfere plays pleasures; consult business matters, you?’ Of course said delighted, Alice, sitting knee, said, ‘We like bother you.’ Father said, ‘I much time you, business takes time. It anxious business--but I cannot bear think left alone like this.’ He looked sad said liked alone. And looked sadder ever. Then Alice said, ‘We mean exactly, Father. It rather lonely sometimes, since Mother died.’ Then quiet little while. Father stayed us till went bed, said good night looked quite cheerful. So told so, said-- ‘Well, fact is, letter took weight mind.’ I cannot think meant--but I sure G. B. would pleased could know taken weight somebody mind. He sort man, I think. We gave scent Dora. It quite good scent thought would be, fifteen shillings--and good, G. B. And fifteen shillings spent felt almost jolly though fortunes properly restored. You notice general fortune much, long money pocket. This many children regular pocket-money never felt duty seek treasure. So, perhaps, pocket-money blessing disguise. But disguise quite impenetrable, like villains’ books; seemed still fifteen shillings spent. Then last others agreed let Oswald try way seeking treasure, keen it, many boy less firm Oswald would chucked whole thing. But Oswald knew hero must rely alone. So stuck it, presently others saw duty, backed up. CHAPTER 10. LORD TOTTENHAM Oswald boy firm unswerving character, never wavered first idea. He felt quite certain books right, best way restore fallen fortunes rescue old gentleman distress. Then brings son: preferred go father’s son I expect old gentleman would make way. In books least thing it--you put railway carriage window--or pick purse drops it--or say hymn suddenly asks to, fortune made. The others, I said, slack it, seem care much trying rescue. They said deadly peril, make one could rescue old gentleman it, Oswald see mattered. However, thought would try easier ways first, himself. So waited station, pulling railway carriage windows old gentlemen looked likely--but nothing happened, last porters said nuisance. So go. No one ever asked say hymn, though learned nice short one, beginning ‘New every morning’--and old gentleman drop two-shilling piece Ellis’s hairdresser’s, Oswald picked up, thinking say returned it, old gentleman caught collar called young thief. It would unpleasant Oswald happened brave boy, knew policeman beat well indeed. So policeman backed up, old gentleman said sorry, offered Oswald sixpence. Oswald refused polite disdain, nothing happened all. When Oswald tried come off, said others, ‘We wasting time, trying rescue old gentleman deadly peril. Come--buck up! Do let us something!’ It dinner-time, Pincher going round getting bits plates. There plenty cold-mutton day. And Alice said-- ‘It fair try Oswald’s way--he tried things others thought of. Why could rescue Lord Tottenham?’ Lord Tottenham old gentleman walks Heath every day paper collar three clock--and gets halfway, one about, changes collar throws dirty one furze-bushes. Dicky said, ‘Lord Tottenham’s right--but deadly peril?’ And could think any. There highwaymen Blackheath now, I sorry say. And though Oswald said half us could highwaymen half rescue party, Dora kept saying would wrong highwayman--and give up. Then Alice said, ‘What Pincher?’ And saw could done. Pincher well bred, know one two things, though never could teach beg. But tell hold on--he it, even say ‘Seize him!’ whisper. So arranged all. Dora said would play; said thought wrong, knew silly--so left out, went sat dining-room goody-book, able say anything it, got row it. Alice H. O. hide furze-bushes Lord Tottenham changes collar, whisper, ‘Seize him!’ Pincher; Pincher seized Lord Tottenham go rescue deadly peril. And would say, ‘How I reward you, noble young preservers?’ would right. So went Heath. We afraid late. Oswald told others Procrastination was--so got furze-bushes little two clock, rather cold. Alice H. O. Pincher hid, Pincher like did, three walked heard whining. And Alice kept saying, ‘I _am_ cold! Is coming yet?’ And H. O. wanted come jump warm himself. But told must learn Spartan boy, ought thankful got beastly fox eating inside time. H. O. little brother, going let fault grows milksop. Besides, really cold. It knees--he wears socks. So stayed were. And last, even three walking beginning feel rather chilly, saw Lord Tottenham’s big black cloak coming along, flapping wind like great bird. So said Alice-- ‘Hist! approaches. You know set Pincher hearing Lord Tottenham talking himself--he always taking collar.’ Then three walked slowly away whistling show thinking anything. Our lips rather cold, managed it. Lord Tottenham came striding along, talking himself. People call mad Protectionist. I know means--but I think people ought call Lord names. As passed us said, ‘Ruin country, sir! Fatal error, fatal error!’ And looked back saw getting quite near Pincher was, Alice H. O. We walked on--so think looking--and minute heard Pincher’s bark, nothing bit; looked round, sure enough good old Pincher got Lord Tottenham trouser leg holding like billy-ho, started run. Lord Tottenham got collar half off--it sticking sideways ear--and shouting, ‘Help, help, murder!’ exactly one explained beforehand do. Pincher growling snarling holding on. When got I stopped said-- ‘Dicky, must rescue good old man.’ Lord Tottenham roared fury, ‘Good old man be--’ something othered. ‘Call dog off.’ So Oswald said, ‘It dangerous task--but would hesitate act true bravery?’ And Pincher worrying snarling, Lord Tottenham shouting us get dog away. He dancing road Pincher hanging like grim death; collar flapping about, undone. Then Noel said, ‘Haste, ere yet late.’ So I said Lord Tottenham-- ‘Stand still, aged sir, I endeavour alleviate distress.’ He stood still, I stooped caught hold Pincher whispered, ‘Drop it, sir; drop it!’ So Pincher dropped it, Lord Tottenham fastened collar again--he never change one looking--and said-- ‘I much obliged, I sure. Nasty vicious brute! Here something drink health.’ But Dicky explained teetotallers, drink people’s healths. So Lord Tottenham said, ‘Well, I much obliged way. And I come look you--of course, young ruffians, gentlemen’s sons, eh? Still, taking tip old boy--I I age,’ pulled half sovereign. It silly; would done I felt would beastly mean take old boy’s chink putting funk. He say anything bringing us sons--so I know do. I let Pincher go, going say welcome, would rather money, seemed best way it, beastly dog spoiled whole show. Directly I let go began jump us bark joy, try lick faces. He proud would done. Lord Tottenham opened eyes said, ‘The dog seems know you.’ And Oswald saw up, said, ‘Good morning,’ tried get away. But Lord Tottenham said-- ‘Not fast!’ And caught Noel collar. Noel gave howl, Alice ran bushes. Noel favourite. I sure I know why. Lord Tottenham looked her, said-- ‘So you!’ And H. O. came out. ‘Do complete party?’ Lord Tottenham asked him. And H. O. said five us time. Lord Tottenham turned sharp began walk away, holding Noel collar. We caught him, asked going, said, ‘To Police Station.’ So I said quite politely, ‘Well, take Noel; strong, easily gets upset. Besides, doing. If want take one take me--it idea.’ Dicky behaved well. He said, ‘If take Oswald I go too, take Noel; delicate little chap.’ Lord Tottenham stopped, said, ‘You thought before.’ Noel howling time, face white, Alice said-- ‘Oh, let Noel go, dear, good, kind Lord Tottenham; faint not, I know will, sometimes. Oh, I wish would never done it! Dora said wrong.’ ‘Dora displayed considerable common sense,’ said Lord Tottenham, let Noel go. And Alice put arm round Noel tried cheer up, trembly, white paper. Then Lord Tottenham said-- ‘Will give word honour try escape?’ So said would. ‘Then follow me,’ said, led way bench. We followed, Pincher too, tail legs--he knew something wrong. Then Lord Tottenham sat down, made Oswald Dicky H. O. stand front him, let Alice Noel sit down. And said-- ‘You set dog me, tried make believe saving it. And would taken half-sovereign. Such conduct most--No--you shall tell is, sir, speak truth.’ So I say ungentlemanly, I said I going take half-sovereign. ‘Then for?’ asked. ‘The truth, mind.’ So I said, ‘I see silly, Dora said wrong, seem till it. We wanted restore fallen fortunes house, books rescue old gentleman deadly peril, brings son--or prefer father’s son, starts business, end wealthy affluence; deadly peril, made Pincher one--and so--’ I ashamed I could go on, seem awfully mean thing. Lord Tottenham said-- ‘A nice way make fortune--by deceit trickery. I horror dogs. If I would weak man shock might killed me. What think yourselves, eh?’ We crying except Oswald, others say was; Lord Tottenham went on--‘Well, well, I see sorry. Let lesson you; say it. I old man now, I young once.’ Then Alice slid along bench close him, put hand arm: fingers pink holes woolly gloves, said, ‘I think good forgive us, really very, sorry. But wanted like children books--only never chances have. Everything turns right. But _are_ sorry, very, very. And I know Oswald going take half-sovereign. Directly said tip old boy I began feel bad inside, I whispered H. O. I wished not.’ Then Lord Tottenham stood up, looked like Death Nelson, clean shaved good face, said-- ‘Always remember never dishonourable thing, money anything else world.’ And promised would remember. Then took hat, took ours, went away, went home. I never felt cheap life! Dora said, ‘I told so,’ mind even much, though indeed hard bear. It Lord Tottenham said ungentlemanly. We go Heath week that; last went, waited bench. When came along Alice said, ‘Please, Lord Tottenham, Heath week, punishment let us off. And brought present take show willing make up.’ He sat bench, gave presents. Oswald gave sixpenny compass--he bought money purpose give him. Oswald always buys useful presents. The needle would move I would day two, Lord Tottenham used admiral, able make go right. Alice made shaving-case, rose worked it. And H. O. gave knife--the one cut buttons best suit with. Dicky gave prize, Naval Heroes, best thing had, Noel gave piece poetry made himself-- When sin shame bow brow Then people feel like now. We sorry grief pain We never ungentlemanly again. Lord Tottenham seemed pleased. He thanked us, talked us bit, said good-bye said-- ‘All’s fair weather now, mates,’ shook hands. And whenever meet nods us, girls us takes hat, cannot really going thinking us ungentlemanly now. CHAPTER 11. CASTILIAN AMOROSO One day suddenly found half crown decided really ought try Dicky’s way restoring fallen fortunes yet deed power. Because might easily happened us never half crown again. So decided dally longer journalists bandits things like them, send sample instructions earn two pounds week spare time. We seen advertisement paper, always wanted it, never money spare before, somehow. The advertisement says: ‘Any lady gentleman easily earn two pounds week spare time. Sample instructions, two shillings. Packed free observation.’ A good deal half-crown Dora’s. It came godmother; said would mind letting Dicky would pay back Christmas, sure right try make fortune way. Of course quite easy, two pounds week spare time easily pay debts, almost much left began with; right told dry up. Dicky always thought really best way restore fallen fortunes, glad chance trying course wanted two pounds week each, besides, rather tired Dicky’s always saying, ways turn well, ‘Why try sample instructions spare time?’ When found half-crown got paper. Noel playing admirals it, made cocked hat without tearing paper, found advertisement, said ever. So got two-shilling postal order stamp, left money agreed would spend ginger-beer drink success trade. We got nice paper Father’s study, Dicky wrote letter, put money put stamp, made H. O. post it. Then drank ginger-beer, waited sample instructions. It seemed long time coming, postman got quite tired us running stopping street ask come. But third morning came. It quite large parcel, packed, advertisement said would be, ‘free observation.’ That means box; inside box stiff browny cardboard, crinkled like galvanized iron tops chicken-houses, inside lot paper, printed scrappy, middle bottle, large, black, sealed top cork yellow sealing-wax. We looked lay nursery table, others grabbed papers see printing said, Oswald went look corkscrew, see inside bottle. He found corkscrew dresser drawer--it always gets there, though supposed sideboard drawer dining-room--and got back others read printed papers. ‘I think much good, I think quite nice sell wine,’ Dora said ‘and besides, easy suddenly begin sell things used it.’ ‘I know,’ said Alice; ‘I believe I could.’ They looked rather mouth, though, Oswald asked make two pounds week. ‘Why, got get people taste stuff bottle. It sherry--Castilian Amoroso name is--and get buy it, write people tell people want wine, every dozen sell get two shillings wine people, sell twenty dozen week get two pounds. I think shall sell much that,’ said Dicky. ‘We might first week,’ Alice said, ‘but people found nice was, would want more. And got ten shillings week would something begin with, would it?’ Oswald said jolly well think would, Dicky took cork corkscrew. The cork broke good deal, bits went bottle. Dora got medicine glass teaspoons tablespoons marked it, agreed teaspoonful each, see like. ‘No one must that,’ Dora said, ‘however nice is.’ Dora behaved rather bottle. I suppose was, lent money it. Then measured teaspoonful, first go, eldest. We asked like, Dora could speak then. Then said, ‘It like tonic Noel spring; perhaps sherry ought like that.’ Then Oswald’s turn. He thought burny; said nothing. He wanted see first others would say. Dicky said simply beastly, Alice said Noel could taste next liked. Noel said golden wine gods, put handkerchief mouth same, I saw face made. Then H. O. his, spat fire, rude nasty, told so. Then Alice’s turn. She said, ‘Only half teaspoonful me, Dora. We must use up.’ And tasted said nothing. Then Dicky said: ‘Look here, I chuck this. I going hawk round beastly stuff. Any one likes bottle. Quis?’ And Alice got ‘Ego’ rest us. Then said, ‘I know matter it. It wants sugar.’ And saw matter stuff. So got two lumps sugar crushed floor one big wooden bricks till powdery, mixed wine tablespoon mark, quite different, nearly nasty. ‘You see right get used it,’ Dicky said. I think sorry said ‘Quis?’ hurry. ‘Of course,’ Alice said, ‘it rather dusty. We must crush sugar carefully clean paper put bottle.’ Dora said afraid would cheating make one bottle nicer people would get ordered dozen bottles, Alice said Dora always made fuss everything, really would quite honest. ‘You see,’ said, ‘I shall tell them, quite truthfully, done it, dozens come themselves.’ So crushed eight lumps, cleanly carefully newspapers, shook well bottle, corked screw paper, brown news, fear poisonous printing ink getting wet dripping wine killing people. We made Pincher taste, sneezed ever long, used go sofa whenever showed bottle. Then asked Alice would try sell to. She said: ‘I shall ask everybody comes house. And that, thinking outside people take to. We must careful: much half left, even counting sugar.’ We wish tell Eliza--I know why. And opened door quickly day, Taxes man came house mistake next door got away Alice chance try Castilian Amoroso. But five Eliza slipped half hour see friend making hat Sunday, gone knock. Alice went, looked banisters. When opened door, said once, ‘Will walk in, please?’ The person door said, ‘I called see Pa, miss. Is home?’ Alice said again, ‘Will walk in, please?’ Then person--it sounded like man--said, ‘He in, then?’ But Alice kept saying, ‘Will walk in, please?’ last man did, rubbing boots loudly mat. Then Alice shut front door, saw butcher, envelope hand. He dressed blue, like cutting sheep things shop, wore knickerbockers. Alice says came bicycle. She led way dining-room, Castilian Amoroso bottle medicine glass standing table ready. The others stayed stairs, Oswald crept looked door-crack. ‘Please sit down,’ said Alice quite calmly, though told afterwards I idea silly felt. And butcher sat down. Then Alice stood quite still said nothing, fiddled medicine glass put screw brown paper straight Castilian bottle. ‘Will tell Pa I would like word him?’ butcher said, got tired saying nothing. ‘He soon, I think,’ Alice said. And stood still said nothing. It beginning look idiotic her, H. O. laughed. I went back cuffed quite quietly, I think butcher heard. But Alice did, roused stupor. She spoke suddenly, fast indeed--so fast I knew made going say before. She got circular. She said, ‘I want call attention sample sherry wine I here. It called Castilian something other, price unequalled flavour bouquet.’ The butcher said, ‘Well--I never!’ And Alice went on, ‘Would like taste it?’ ‘Thank much, I sure, miss,’ said butcher. Alice poured out. The butcher tasted little. He licked lips, thought going say good was. But not. He put medicine glass nearly stuff left (we put back bottle afterwards save waste) said, ‘Excuse me, miss, little sweet?--for sherry I mean?’ ‘The _Real_ not,’ said Alice. ‘If order dozen come quite different that--we like best sugar. I wish _would_ order some.’ The butcher asked why. Alice speak minute, said-- ‘I mind telling _you_: business yourself, you? We trying get people buy it, shall two shillings every dozen make one buy. It called purr something.’ ‘A percentage. Yes, I see,’ said butcher, looking hole carpet. ‘You see reasons,’ Alice went on, ‘why want make fortunes quickly can.’ ‘Quite so,’ said butcher, looked place paper coming wall. ‘And seems good way,’ Alice went on. ‘We paid two shillings sample instructions, says make two pounds week easily leisure time.’ ‘I sure I hope may, miss,’ said butcher. And Alice said would buy some? ‘Sherry favourite wine,’ said. Alice asked drink. ‘No, thank you, miss,’ said; ‘it favourite wine, agree me; least bit. But I uncle drinks it. Suppose I ordered half dozen Christmas present? Well, miss, shilling commission, anyway,’ pulled handful money gave shilling. ‘But I thought wine people paid that,’ Alice said. But butcher said half-dozens not. Then said think would wait longer Father--but would Alice ask Father write him? Alice offered sherry again, said something ‘Not worlds!’--and let came back us shilling, said, ‘How that?’ And said ‘A1.’ And evening talked fortune begun make. Nobody came next day, day lady came ask money build orphanage children dead sailors. And saw her. I went Alice. And explained shilling wanted something else, Alice suddenly said, ‘Would like wine?’ And lady said, ‘Thank much,’ looked surprised. She young lady, mantle beads, beads come places--leaving browny braid showing, printed papers dead sailors sealskin bag, seal come places, leaving skin bare. We gave tablespoonful wine proper wine-glass sideboard, lady. And tasted got great hurry, shook dress snapped bag shut, said, ‘You naughty, wicked children! What mean playing trick like this? You ought ashamed yourselves! I shall write Mamma it. You dreadful little girl!--you might poisoned me. But Mamma...’ Then Alice said, ‘I sorry; butcher liked it, said sweet. And please write Mother. It makes Father unhappy letters come her!’--and Alice near crying. ‘What mean, silly child?’ said lady, looking quite bright interested. ‘Why Father like Mother letters--eh?’ And Alice said, ‘OH, you...!’ began cry, bolted room. Then I said, ‘Our Mother dead, please go away now?’ The lady looked minute, looked quite different, said, ‘I sorry. I know. Never mind wine. I daresay little sister meant kindly.’ And looked round room like butcher done. Then said again, ‘I know--I sorry...’ So I said, ‘Do mention it,’ shook hands her, let out. Of course could asked buy wine would said. But I think bad sort person. I like person say sorry ought be--especially grown-up. They seldom. I suppose think much it. But Alice I feel jolly ever long afterwards. And I went back dining-room I saw different Mother here, different, Father different, nothing like was. I glad I made think every day. I went found Alice, told lady said, finished crying put away bottle said would try sell people came. And tell others--we said lady buy any--but went Heath, soldiers went Punch-and-judy show, came back better. The bottle got quite dusty put it, perhaps dust ages would laid thick heavy it, clergyman called out. He clergyman--Mr Bristow clergyman, love him, would try sell sherry people like, make two pounds week spare time. It another clergyman, stray one; asked Eliza dear children would like come little Sunday school. We always spend Sunday afternoons Father. But left name vicarage Eliza, asked tell us come, thought would go call him, explain Sunday afternoons, thought might well take sherry us. ‘I go unless go too,’ Alice said, ‘and I talking.’ Dora said thought much better go; said ‘Rot!’ ended coming us, I glad did. Oswald said would talking others liked, learned say printed papers. We went Vicarage early Saturday afternoon, rang bell. It new red house trees garden, yellow mould gravel. It neat dry. Just rang bell heard one inside call ‘Jane! Jane!’ thought would Jane anything. It sound voice called made us sorry her. The door opened neat servant black, white apron; saw tying strings came along hall, different-coloured glass door. Her face red, I think Jane. We asked could see Mr Mallow. The servant said Mr Mallow busy sermon then, would see. But Oswald said, ‘It right. He asked us come.’ So let us shut front door, showed us tidy room bookcase full lot books covered black cotton white labels, dull pictures, harmonium. And Mr Mallow writing desk drawers, copying something book. He stout short, wore spectacles. He covered writing went in--I know why. He looked rather cross, heard Jane somebody scolded outside voice. I hope letting us in, I doubts. ‘Well,’ said clergyman, ‘what about?’ ‘You asked us call,’ Dora said, ‘about little Sunday school. We Bastables Lewisham Road.’ ‘Oh--ah, yes,’ said; ‘and shall I expect to-morrow?’ He took pen fiddled it, ask us sit down. But us did. ‘We always spend Sunday afternoon Father,’ said Dora; ‘but wished thank kind ask us.’ ‘And wished ask something else!’ said Oswald; made sign Alice get sherry ready glass. She did--behind Oswald’s back speaking. ‘My time limited,’ said Mr Mallow, looking watch; ‘but still--’ Then muttered something fold, went on: ‘Tell troubling you, little man, I try give help power. What want?’ Then Oswald quickly took glass Alice, held him, said, ‘I want opinion that.’ ‘On _that_,’ said. ‘What it?’ ‘It shipment,’ Oswald said; ‘but quite enough taste.’ Alice filled glass half-full; I suppose excited measure properly. ‘A shipment?’ said clergyman, taking glass hand. ‘Yes,’ Oswald went On; ‘an exceptional opportunity. Full-bodied nutty.’ ‘It really taste rather like one kind Brazil-nut.’ Alice put oar usual. The Vicar looked Alice Oswald, back again, Oswald went learned printing. The clergyman held glass half-arm’s-length, stiffly, caught cold. ‘It quality never offered price. Old Delicate Amoro--what name--’ ‘Amorolio,’ said H. O. ‘Amoroso,’ said Oswald. ‘H. O., shut up--Castilian Amoroso--it true after-dinner wine, stimulating yet...’ ‘_Wine_?’ said Mr Mallow, holding glass off. ‘Do _know_,’ went on, making voice thick strong (I expect like church), ‘have never _taught_ drinking _wine_ _spirits_--yes, _beer_, makes half homes England full _wretched_ little children, _degraded_, _miserable_ parents?’ ‘Not put sugar it,’ said Alice firmly; ‘eight lumps shake bottle. We teaspoonful it, ill all. It something else upset H. O. Most likely acorns got Park.’ The clergyman seemed speechless conflicting emotions, door opened lady came in. She white cap lace, ugly violet flower it, tall, looked strong, though thin. And I believe listening door. ‘But why,’ Vicar saying, ‘why bring dreadful fluid, curse country, _me_ taste?’ ‘Because thought might buy some,’ said Dora, never sees game up. ‘In books parson loves bottle old port; new sherry good--with sugar--for people like sherry. And would order dozen wine, get two shillings.’ The lady said (and _was_ voice), ‘Good gracious! Nasty, sordid little things! Have one teach better?’ And Dora got said, ‘No, things say; sorry came called names. We want make fortune much Mr Mallow does--only one would listen us preached, use copying sermons like him.’ And I think smart Dora, even rather rude. Then I said perhaps better go, lady said, ‘I think so!’ But going wrap bottle glass clergyman said, ‘No; leave that,’ upset did, though all. We walked home fast saying much, girls went rooms. When I went tell tea ready, teacake, Dora crying like anything Alice hugging her. I afraid great deal crying chapter, I cannot help it. Girls sometimes; I suppose nature, ought sorry affliction. ‘It good,’ Dora saying, ‘you hate me, think I prig busybody, I try right--oh, I do! Oswald, go away; come making fun me!’ So I said, ‘I making fun, Sissy; cry, old girl.’ Mother taught call Sissy little others came, I often somehow, old. I patted back, put head sleeve, holding Alice time, went on. She laughy-cryey state people say things would say times. ‘Oh dear, oh dear--I try, I do. And Mother died said, “Dora, take care others, teach good, keep trouble make happy.” She said, “Take care me, Dora dear.” And I tried, hate it; to-day I let this, though I knew time silly.’ I hope think I muff I kissed Dora time. Because girls like it. And I never say comes good elder sister much. And I put though I hate telling it, I I hard Dora, I never again. She good old sort; course never knew Mother told her, would ragged did. We tell little ones, I got Alice speak Dicky, three sit others requisite. This made us forget sherry; eight clock knock, Eliza went, saw poor Jane, name Jane, Vicarage. She handed brown-paper parcel letter. And three minutes later Father called us study. On table brown-paper parcel, open, bottle glass it, Father letter hand. He Pointed bottle sighed, said, ‘What now?’ The letter hand covered little black writing, four large pages. So Dicky spoke up, told Father whole thing, far knew it, Alice I told dead sailors’ lady. And done, Alice said, ‘Has Mr Mallow written say buy dozen sherry all? It really half bad sugar it.’ Father said no, think clergymen could afford expensive wine; said _he_ would like taste it. So gave left, decided coming home would give trying two pounds week spare time. Father tasted it, acted H. O. done teaspoonful, course say anything. Then laughed till I thought would never stop. I think sherry, I sure I read somewhere ‘wine maketh glad heart man’. He little, shows good after-dinner wine, stimulating, yet ...I forget rest. But done laughing said, ‘It right, kids. Only again. The wine trade overcrowded; besides, I thought promised consult going business?’ ‘Before buying one I thought meant,’ said Dicky. ‘This commission.’ And Father laughed again. I glad got Castilian Amoroso, really cheer Father up, cannot always that, however hard try, even make jokes, give comic paper. CHAPTER 12. THE NOBLENESS OF OSWALD The part nobleness comes end, would understand unless knew began. It began, like nearly everything time, treasure-seeking. Of course soon promised consult Father business matters gave wanting go business. I know is, consult thing grown-up people, even bravest best, seems make thing worth afterwards. We mind Albert’s uncle chipping sometimes thing’s going on, glad never asked us promise consult anything. Yet Oswald saw Father quite right; I daresay hundred pounds spent share lucrative business sale useful patent, found afterwards done better spend money way. My Father says so, ought know. We several ideas time, little chink always stood way. This case H. O.’s idea setting coconut-shy side Heath, none generally. We sticks wooden balls, greengrocer said could book many twelve dozen coconuts without Mr Bastable’s written order. And wish consult Father decided drop it. And Alice dressed Pincher dolls’ clothes made minds take round organ soon taught dance, stopped Dicky’s remembering heard organ cost seven hundred pounds. Of course big church kind, even ones three legs cannot got one-and-sevenpence, first thought it. So gave too. It wet day, I remember, mutton hash dinner--very tough pale gravy lumps it. I think others would left good deal sides plates, although know better, Oswald said savoury stew made red deer Edward shot. So Children New Forest, mutton tasted much better. No one New Forest minds venison tough gravy pale. Then dinner let girls dolls’ tea-party, condition expect us boys wash up; drinking last liquorice water little cups Dicky said-- ‘This reminds me.’ So said, ‘What of?’ Dicky answered us once, though mouth full bread liquorice stuck look like cake. You speak mouth full, even relations, wipe mouth back hand, handkerchief, one. Dicky this. He said-- ‘Why, remember first began treasure-seeking, I said I thought something, I could tell I finished thinking it.’ We said ‘Yes.’ ‘Well, liquorice water--’ ‘Tea,’ said Alice softly. ‘Well, tea then--made think.’ He going say made think, Noel interrupted cried out, ‘I say; let us finish old tea-party council war.’ So got flags wooden sword drum, Oswald beat girls washed up, till Eliza came say jumping toothache, noise went like knife. So course Oswald left once. When polite Oswald never refuses grant requests. When dressed sat round camp fire, Dicky began again. ‘Every one world wants money. Some people get it. The people get ones see things. I seen one thing.’ Dicky stopped smoked pipe peace. It pipe bubbles summer, somehow got broken yet. We put tea-leaves pipe peace, girls allowed any. It right let girls smoke. They get think much let everything men. Oswald said, ‘Out it.’ ‘I see glass bottles cost penny. H. O., dare snigger I send round selling old bottles, shall sweets except money get them. And you, Noel.’ ‘Noel sniggering,’ said Alice hurry; ‘it taking much interest saying makes look like that. Be quiet, H. O., make faces, either. Do go on, Dicky dear.’ So Dicky went on. ‘There must hundreds millions bottles medicines sold every year. Because different medicines say, “Thousands cures daily,” take two thousand, must be, least, mounts up. And people sell must make great deal money nearly always two-and-ninepence bottle, three-and-six one nearly double size. Now bottles, I saying, cost anything like that.’ ‘It medicine costs money,’ said Dora; ‘look expensive jujubes chemist’s, peppermints too.’ ‘That nice,’ Dicky explained; ‘nasty things dear. Look lot brimstone get penny, alum. We would put nice kinds chemist’s things medicine.’ Then went tell us invented medicine would write tell editor it, would put paper, people would send two-and-ninepence three-and-six bottle nearly double size, medicine cured would write paper letters would printed, saying suffering years, never thought get again, thanks blessing ointment--’ Dora interrupted said, ‘Not ointment--it messy.’ And Alice thought too. And Dicky said mean it, quite decided let bottles. So settled, see time would sort going business, afterwards Albert’s uncle showed us saw it, sorry. We invent medicine. You might think easy, number see every day paper, much harder think. First decide sort illness like cure, ‘heated discussion ensued’, like Parliament. Dora wanted something make complexion dazzling fairness, remembered face came red rough used Rosabella soap advertised make darkest complexion fair lily, agreed perhaps better not. Noel wanted make medicine first find would cure, Dicky thought not, many medicines things matter us, would easier choose disease first. Oswald would liked wounds. I still think good idea, Dicky said, ‘Who wounds, especially wars? We sell bottle day!’ So Oswald gave knows manners are, Dicky’s idea. H. O. wanted cure uncomfortable feeling give powders for, explained grown-up people feeling, however much eat, agreed. Dicky said care straw loathsome disease was, long hurried settled something. Then Alice said-- ‘It ought something common, one thing. Not pains back hundreds things people somebody syrup. What commonest thing all?’ And said, ‘Colds.’ So settled. Then wrote label go bottle. When written would go vinegar bottle got, knew would go small printed. It like this: BASTABLE’S CERTAIN CURE FOR COLDS Coughs, Asthma, Shortness Breath, infections Chest One dose gives immediate relief It cure cold one bottle Especially larger size 3s. 6d. Order Makers To prevent disappointment Makers: D., O., R., A., N., H. O. BASTABLE 150, Lewisham Road, S.E. (A halfpenny bottles returned) ------------ Of course next thing one us catch cold try cured it; wanted one, Dicky’s idea, said going done it, let him. It fair. He left undershirt day, next morning stood draught nightgown quite long time. And damped day-shirt nail-brush put on. But vain. They always tell things give cold, found so. So went Park, Dicky went right water boots on, stood long could bear it, rather cold, stood cheered on. He walked home wet clothes, say sure thing, go, though boots quite spoiled. And three days Noel began cough sneeze. So Dicky said fair. ‘I cannot help it,’ Noel said. ‘You caught yourself, would come me.’ And Alice said known along Noel ought stood bank cheering cold. Noel go bed, began make medicines; sorry it, fun taking things. We made great many medicines. Alice made herb tea. She got sage thyme savory marjoram boiled together salt water, _would_ put parsley too. Oswald sure parsley herb. It put cold meat supposed eat it. It kills parrots eat parsley, I believe. I expect parsley disagreed Noel. The medicine seem cough good. Oswald got pennyworth alum, cheap, turpentine every one knows good colds, little sugar aniseed ball. These mixed bottle water, Eliza threw away said nasty rubbish, I money get things with. Dora made gruel, said chest good; course use, cannot put gruel bottles say medicine. It would honest, besides nobody would believe you. Dick mixed lemon-juice sugar little juice red flannel Noel’s throat done in. It comes beautifully hot water. Noel took liked it. Noel’s idea liquorice-water, let it, plain black sell bottles proper price. Noel liked H. O.’s medicine best, silly him, peppermints melted hot water, little cobalt make look blue. It right, H. O.’s paint-box French kind, Couleurs non Veneneuses it. This means may suck brushes want to, even paints little boy. It rather jolly Noel cold. He fire bedroom opens Dicky’s Oswald’s, girls used read aloud Noel day; read aloud well. Father away Liverpool business, Albert’s uncle Hastings. We rather glad this, wished give medicines fair trial, grown-ups fond interfering. As given anything poisonous! His cold went on--it bad head, one kind poultices cannot sit bed. But head nearly week, Oswald happened tumble Alice stairs. When got crying. ‘Do cry silly!’ said Oswald; ‘you know I hurt you.’ I sorry I hurt her, ought sit stairs dark let people tumble you. You ought remember beastly hurt you. ‘Oh, that, Oswald,’ Alice said. ‘Do pig! I miserable. Do kind me.’ So Oswald thumped back told shut up. ‘It Noel,’ said. ‘I sure ill; playing medicines well, I know ill, Eliza send doctor: says cold. And I know doctor’s bills awful. I heard Father telling Aunt Emily summer. But _is_ ill, perhaps die something.’ Then began cry again. Oswald thumped again, knows good brother ought behave, said, ‘Cheer up.’ If book Oswald would embraced little sister tenderly, mingled tears hers. Then Oswald said, ‘Why write Father?’ And cried said, ‘I lost paper address. H. O. draw back of, I cannot find now; I looked everywhere. I tell I going do. No I not. But I going out. Do tell others. And I say, Oswald, pretend I Eliza asks. Promise.’ ‘Tell going do,’ I said. But said ‘No’; good reason not. So I said I would promise came that. Of course I meant right. But seem mean tell me. So Alice went side door Eliza setting tea, long time gone; tea. When Eliza asked Oswald said know, perhaps tidying corner drawer. Girls often this, takes long time. Noel coughed good bit tea, asked Alice. Oswald told something secret. Oswald tell lies even save sister. When Alice came back quiet, whispered Oswald right. When rather late Eliza said going post letter. This always takes hour, _will_ go post-office across Heath instead pillar-box, boy dropped fusees pillar-box burnt letters. It us; Eliza told us it. And knock door long time thought Eliza come back, forgotten back-door key. We made H. O. go open door, place run about: legs younger ours. And heard boots stairs besides H. O.’s, listened spellbound till door opened, Albert’s uncle. He looked tired. ‘I glad come,’ Oswald said. ‘Alice began think Noel--’ Alice stopped me, face red, nose shiny too, cried much tea. She said, ‘I said I thought Noel ought doctor. Do think ought?’ She got hold Albert’s uncle held him. ‘Let us look you, young man,’ said Albert’s uncle, sat edge bed. It rather shaky bed, bar keeps steady underneath got broken playing burglars last winter. It crowbar. He began feel Noel’s pulse, went talking. ‘It revealed Arab physician made merry tents wild plains Hastings Presence cold head. So immediately seated magic carpet, bade bear hither, pausing flight purchase sweetmeats bazaar.’ He pulled jolly lot chocolate butterscotch, grapes Noel. When said thank you, went on. ‘The physician’s words wisdom: high time kid asleep. I spoken. Ye leave depart.’ So bunked, Dora Albert’s uncle made Noel comfortable night. Then came nursery gone to, sat Guy Fawkes chair said, ‘Now then.’ Alice said, ‘You may tell I did. I daresay wax, I care.’ ‘I think wise,’ said Albert’s uncle, pulling close sit knee. ‘I glad telegraphed.’ So Oswald understood Alice’s secret was. She gone sent telegram Albert’s uncle Hastings. But Oswald thought might told him. Afterwards told put telegram. It was, ‘Come home. We given Noel cold, I think killing him.’ With address came tenpence-halfpenny. Then Albert’s uncle began ask questions, came out, Dicky tried catch cold, cold gone Noel instead, medicines all. Albert’s uncle looked serious. ‘Look here,’ said, ‘You old enough play fool like this. Health best thing got; ought know better risk it. You might killed little brother precious medicines. You lucky escape, certainly. But poor Noel!’ ‘Oh, think going die?’ Alice asked that, crying again. ‘No, no,’ said Albert’s uncle; ‘but look here. Do see silly been? And I thought promised Father--’ And gave us long talking-to. He make feel awfully small. At last stopped, said sorry, said, ‘You know I promised take pantomime?’ So said, ‘Yes,’ knew well going to. Then went on-- ‘Well, I take like, I take Noel sea week cure cold. Which be?’ Of course knew say, ‘Take Noel’ did; Dicky told afterwards thought hard H. O. Albert’s uncle stayed till Eliza came in, said good night way showed us forgiven forgotten. And went bed. It must middle night Oswald woke suddenly, Alice teeth chattering, shaking wake him. ‘Oh, Oswald!’ said, ‘I unhappy. Suppose I die night!’ Oswald told go bed gas. But said, ‘I must tell you; I wish I would told Albert’s uncle. I thief, I die to-night I know thieves go to.’ So Oswald saw good sat bed said--‘Go ahead.’ So Alice stood shivering said--‘I enough money telegram, I took bad sixpence exchequer. And I paid fivepence I had. And I would tell you, would stopped I could borne it; would helped would thief too. Oh, shall I do?’ Oswald thought minute, said-- ‘You would better told me. But I think right pay back. Go bed. Cross you? No, stupid! Only another time would better keep secrets.’ So kissed Oswald, let her, went back bed. The next day Albert’s uncle took Noel away, Oswald time persuade Alice ought tell sixpence. Alice unhappy, much night: miserable night done anything wrong happen awake. I know fact. None us money except Eliza, would give us unless said for; course could honour family. And Oswald anxious get sixpence give telegraph people feared badness sixpence might found out, police might come Alice moment. I think I ever unhappy day. Of course could written Albert’s uncle, would taken long time, every moment delay added Alice’s danger. We thought thought, could think way get sixpence. It seems small sum, see Alice’s liberty depended it. It quite late afternoon I met Mrs Leslie Parade. She brown fur coat lot yellow flowers hands. She stopped speak me, asked Poet was. I told cold, I wondered whether would lend sixpence I asked her, I could make mind begin say it. It hard thing say--much harder would think. She talked bit, suddenly got cab, said-- ‘I would idea late,’ told man go. And started shoved yellow flowers window said, ‘For sick poet, love,’ driven off. Gentle reader, I conceal Oswald did. He knew disgracing family, like I going say: really Noel’s flowers, could sent Hastings, Oswald knew would say ‘Yes’ Oswald asked him. Oswald sacrificed family pride little sister’s danger. I say noble boy--I tell did, decide nobleness. He put oldest clothes--they much older would think saw tidy--and took yellow chrysanthemums walked Greenwich Station waited trains bringing people London. He sold flowers penny bunches got tenpence. Then went telegraph office Lewisham, said lady there: ‘A little girl gave bad sixpence yesterday. Here six good pennies.’ The lady said noticed it, never mind, Oswald knew ‘Honesty best Policy’, refused take back pennies. So last said put plate Sunday. She nice lady. I like way hair. Then Oswald went home Alice told her, hugged him, said dear, good, kind boy, said ‘Oh, right.’ We bought peppermint bullseyes fourpence I over, others wanted know got money, would tell. Only afterwards Noel came home told him, flowers, said quite right. He made poetry it. I remember one bit it. The noble youth high degree Consents play menial part, All sister Alice’s sake, Who dear faithful heart. But Oswald never bragged it. We got treasure this, unless count peppermint bullseyes. CHAPTER 13. THE ROBBER AND THE BURGLAR A day two Noel came back Hastings snow; jolly. And cleared path. A man sixpence least, always save can. A penny saved penny earned. And thought would nice clear top portico, lies thick, edges cut knife. And got landing-window portico, Water Rates came path book tears thing says much got pay, little ink-bottle hung buttonhole case pay him. Father says Water Rates sensible man, knows always well prepared whatever happens, however unlikely. Alice said afterwards rather liked Water Rates, really, Noel said face like good vizier, man rewards honest boy restoring purse, think things time, Water Rates came steps, shovelled great square slab snow like avalanche--and fell right head. Two us thought moment, quite large avalanche. And Water Rates shaken rang bell. It Saturday, Father home. We know wrong ungentlemanly shovel snow porticoes Water Rates, person, hope catch cold, sorry. We apologized Water Rates Father told us to. We sent bed it. We deserved punishment, others would shovelled snow would thought it--only quick thinking things are. And even quite wrong things sometimes lead adventures; every one knows ever read pirates highwaymen. Eliza hates us sent bed early, means bring meals up, means lighting fire Noel’s room ever much earlier usual. He fire still bit cold. But particular day got Eliza good temper giving horrid brooch pretending amethysts it, aunt gave Alice, Eliza brought extra scuttle coals, greengrocer came potatoes (he always late Saturdays) got chestnuts him. So heard Father go dinner, jolly fire Noel’s room, able go Red Indians blankets comfortably. Eliza gone out; says gets things cheaper Saturday nights. She great friend, sells fish shop, generous, let us herrings less half natural price. So alone house; Pincher Eliza, talked robbers. And Dora thought would dreadful trade, Dicky said-- ‘I think would interesting. And would rob rich people, generous poor needy, like Claude Duval.’ Dora said, ‘It wrong robber.’ ‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘you would never know happy hour. Think trying sleep stolen jewels bed, remembering quantities policemen detectives world!’ ‘There ways robbers wrong,’ said Noel; ‘if rob robber right act.’ ‘But cannot,’ said Dora; ‘he clever, besides, wrong anyway.’ ‘Yes can, not; murdering boiling oil right act, too, there!’ said Noel. ‘What Ali Baba? Now then!’ And felt score Noel. ‘What would _was_ robber?’ said Alice. H. O. said would kill boiling oil; Alice explained meant real robber--now--this minute--in house. Oswald Dicky say; Noel said thought would fair ask robber quite politely quietly go away, could deal him. Now I going tell strange wonderful thing, I hope able believe it. I not, boy told me, unless I knew man honour, perhaps unless gave sacred word. But true, same, shows days romance daring deeds yet end. Alice asking Noel _how_ would deal robber would go asked politely quietly, heard noise downstairs--quite plain noise, kind noise fancy hear. It like somebody moving chair. We held breath listened came another noise, like one poking fire. Now, remember one _to_ poke fire move chair downstairs, Eliza Father out. They could come without hearing them, front door hard shut back one, whichever go give slam hear street. H. O. Alice Dora caught hold other’s blankets looked Dicky Oswald, every one quite pale. And Noel whispered-- ‘It ghosts, I know is’--and listened again, noise. Presently Dora said whisper-- ‘Whatever shall do? Oh, whatever shall do--what _shall_ do?’ And kept saying till tell shut up. O reader, ever playing Red Indians blankets round bedroom fire house thought one you--and suddenly heard noise like chair, fire poked, downstairs? Unless able imagine feels like. It like books; hair stand end all, never said ‘Hist!’ once, feet got cold, though blankets fire, insides Oswald’s hands got warm wet, nose cold like dog’s, ears burning hot. The girls said afterwards shivered terror, teeth chattered, see hear time. ‘Shall open window call police?’ said Dora; Oswald suddenly thought something, breathed freely said-- ‘I _know_ ghosts, I believe robbers. I expect stray cat got coals came morning, hiding cellar, moving about. Let us go see.’ The girls would not, course; I could see breathed freely too. But Dicky said, ‘All right; I will.’ H. O. said, ‘Do think _really_ cat?’ So said better stay girls. And course let Alice come. Dora said took Noel cold, would scream ‘Fire!’ ‘Murder!’ mind whole street heard. So Noel agreed getting clothes on, rest us said would go look cat. Now Oswald _said_ cat, made easier go down, inside feel sure might robbers all. Of course, often talked robbers before, different sit room listen listen listen; Oswald felt somehow would easier go see was, wait, listen, wait, wait, listen, wait, perhaps hear _it_, whatever was, come creeping slowly stairs softly _it_ could _its_ boots off, stairs creaking, towards room door open case Eliza coming back suddenly, dark landings. And would bad, would lasted longer, would known coward besides. Dicky says felt things. Many people would say young heroes go did; I tried explain, young hero wishes credit deserves. The landing gas turned low--just blue bead--and four went softly, wrapped blankets, stood top stairs good long time began go down. And listened listened till ears buzzed. And Oswald whispered Dicky, Dicky went room fetched large toy pistol foot long, trigger broken, I took I eldest; I think either us thought cat now. But Alice H. O. did. Dicky got poker Noel’s room, told Dora settle cat caught her. Then Oswald whispered, ‘Let us play burglars; Dicky I armed teeth, go first. You keep flight behind us, reinforcement attacked. Or retreat defend women children fortress, would rather.’ But said would reinforcement. Oswald’s teeth chattered little spoke. It anything else except cold. So Dicky Oswald crept down, got bottom stairs, saw Father’s study door ajar, crack light. And Oswald pleased see light, knowing burglars prefer dark, rate dark lantern, felt really sure _was_ cat all, thought would fun make others upstairs think really robber. So cocked pistol--you cock it, go off--and said, ‘Come on, Dick!’ rushed study door burst room, crying, ‘Surrender! discovered! Surrender, I fire! Throw hands!’ And, finished saying it, saw him, standing study hearthrug, Real Robber. There mistake it. Oswald sure robber, screwdriver hands, standing near cupboard door H. O. broke lock off; gimlets screws things floor. There nothing cupboard old ledgers magazines tool chest, course, robber could know beforehand. When Oswald saw really robber, heavily armed screwdriver, feel comfortable. But kept pistol pointed robber, and--you hardly believe it, true--the robber threw screwdriver clattering tools, _did_ throw hands, said-- ‘I surrender; shoot me! How many there?’ So Dicky said, ‘You outnumbered. Are armed?’ And robber said, ‘No, least.’ And Oswald said, still pointing pistol, feeling strong brave book, ‘Turn pockets.’ The robber did: turned out, looked him. He middle height, clad black frock-coat grey trousers. His boots little gone sides, shirt-cuffs bit frayed, otherwise gentlemanly demeanour. He thin, wrinkled face, big, light eyes sparkled, looked soft queerly, short beard. In youth must fair golden colour, tinged grey. Oswald sorry him, especially saw one pockets large hole it, nothing pockets letters string three boxes matches, pipe handkerchief thin tobacco pouch two pennies. We made put things table, said-- ‘Well, caught me; going me? Police?’ Alice H. O. come reinforcements, heard shout, Alice saw Real Robber, surrendered, clapped hands said, ‘Bravo, boys!’ H. O. And said, ‘If gives word honour escape, I call police: seems pity. Wait till Father comes home.’ The robber agreed this, gave word honour, asked might put pipe, said ‘Yes,’ sat Father’s armchair warmed boots, steamed, I sent H. O. Alice put clothes tell others, bring Dicky’s knickerbockers, rest chestnuts. And came, sat round fire, jolly. The robber friendly, talked us great deal. ‘I always low way business,’ said, Noel said something things turned pockets. ‘It great come-down man like me. But, I must caught, something caught brave young heroes like you. My stars! How bolt room,--“Surrender, hands!” You might born bred thief-catching.’ Oswald sorry mean, could think one study brave rash act. He told since. ‘And made think one house?’ robber asked, thrown head back, laughed quite half minute. So told him. And applauded valour, Alice H. O. explained would said ‘Surrender,’ too, reinforcements. The robber ate chestnuts--and sat wondered Father would come home, would say us intrepid conduct. And robber told us things done began break houses. Dicky picked tools floor, suddenly said-- ‘Why, Father’s screwdriver gimlets, all! Well, I call jolly cheek pick man’s locks tools!’ ‘True, true,’ said robber. ‘It cheek, jolliest! But see I come world. I highway robber once, horses expensive hire--five shillings hour, know--and I could afford keep them. The highwayman business was.’ ‘What bike?’ said H. O. But robber thought cycles low--and besides could go across country occasion arose, could trusty steed. And talked highwaymen knew liked hearing it. Then told us pirate captain--and sailed waves mountains high, gained rich prizes--and _did_ begin think found profession mind. ‘I say ups downs it,’ said, ‘especially stormy weather. But trade! And sword side, Jolly Roger flying peak, prize sight. And black mouths guns pointed laden trader--and wind favour, trusty crew ready live die you! Oh--but grand life!’ I feel sorry him. He used nice words, gentleman’s voice. ‘I sure brought pirate,’ said Dora. She dressed even collar--and made Noel too--but rest us blankets odd things put anyhow underneath. The robber frowned sighed. ‘No,’ said, ‘I brought law. I Balliol, bless hearts, true anyway.’ He sighed again, looked hard fire. ‘That Father’s college,’ H. O. beginning, Dicky said--‘Why leave pirate?’ ‘A pirate?’ said, thinking things. ‘Oh, yes; I gave because--because I could get dreadful sea-sickness.’ ‘Nelson sea-sick,’ said Oswald. ‘Ah,’ said robber; ‘but I luck pluck, something. He stuck Trafalgar, he? “Kiss me, Hardy”--and that, eh? _I_ could stick it--I resign. And nobody kissed _me_.’ I saw understanding Nelson really man good school well Balliol. Then asked him, ‘And then?’ And Alice asked ever coiner, told thought would caught desperate gang next door, much interested said glad never taken coining. ‘Besides, coins ugly nowadays,’ said, ‘no one could really find pleasure making them. And hole-and-corner business best, it?--and must thirsty one--with hot metal furnaces things.’ And looked fire. Oswald forgot minute interesting stranger robber, asked would drink. Oswald heard Father friends, knows right thing. The robber said mind did. And right, too. And Dora went got bottle Father’s ale--the Light Sparkling Family--and glass, gave robber. Dora said would responsible. Then drink told us bandits, said bad wet weather. Bandits’ caves hardly ever properly weathertight. And bush-ranging same. ‘As matter fact,’ said, ‘I bush-ranging afternoon, among furze-bushes Heath, I luck. I stopped Lord Mayor gilt coach, footmen plush gold lace, smart cockatoos. But go. The Lord Mayor stiver pockets. One footmen six new pennies: Lord Mayor always pays servants’ wages new pennies. I spent fourpence bread cheese, table’s tuppence. Ah, poor trade!’ And filled pipe again. We turned gas, Father jolly good surprise come home, sat talked pleasant could be. I never liked new man better I liked robber. And I felt sorry him. He told us war-correspondent editor, happier days, well horse-stealer colonel dragoons. And quite suddenly, telling Lord Tottenham highwaymen ourselves, put hand said ‘Shish!’ quiet listened. There scrape, scrape, scraping noise; came downstairs. ‘They filing something,’ whispered robber, ‘here--shut up, give pistol, poker. There burglar now, mistake.’ ‘It toy one go off,’ I said, ‘but cock it.’ Then heard snap. ‘There goes window bar,’ said robber softly. ‘Jove! adventure! You kids stay here, I tackle it.’ But Dicky I said come. So let us go far bottom kitchen stairs, took tongs shovel us. There light kitchen; little light. It curious never thought, us, might plant robber’s get away. We never thought doubting word honour. And right. That noble robber dashed kitchen door open, rushed big toy pistol one hand poker other, shouting like Oswald done-- ‘Surrender! You discovered! Surrender, I fire! Throw hands!’ And Dicky I rattled tongs shovel might know us, bristling weapons. And heard husky voice kitchen saying-- ‘All right, governor! Stow scent sprinkler. I give in. Blowed I pretty well sick job, anyway.’ Then went in. Our robber standing grandest manner legs wide apart, pistol pointing cowering burglar. The burglar large man mean beard, I think, got one, red comforter, fur cap, face red voice thick. How different robber! The burglar dark lantern, standing plate-basket. When lit gas thought like burglar ought be. He look could ever pirate highwayman, anything really dashing noble, scowled shuffled feet said: ‘Well, go on: yer fetch pleece?’ ‘Upon word, I know,’ said robber, rubbing chin. ‘Oswald, fetch police?’ It every robber I would stand Christian names from, I tell I think that. I said--‘Do mean I fetch one?’ Our robber looked burglar said nothing. Then burglar began speak fast, look different ways hard, shiny little eyes. ‘Lookee ‘ere, governor,’ said, ‘I stony broke, help me, I was. And blessed I nicked haporth little lot. You know much tempt bloke,’ shook plate-basket angry it, yellowy spoons forks rattled. ‘I a-looking ‘ere Bank-ollerday show, come. Let off, sir. Come now, I got kids home, strike I not--same yours--I got nipper ‘is size, come I lagged? I long, sir, I ‘andy it.’ ‘No,’ said robber; ‘you certainly not.’ Alice others come see happening. Alice told afterwards thought really cat time. ‘No, I ‘andy, say, sir, let I chuck whole blooming bizz; rake civvy, I will. Do hard cove, mister; think missis kids. I got one cut little missy bless ‘er pretty ‘eart.’ ‘Your family certainly fits circumstances nicely,’ said robber. Then Alice said-- ‘Oh, let go! If got little girl like me, whatever do? Suppose Father!’ ‘I think got little girl like you, dear,’ said robber, ‘and I think safer lock key.’ ‘You ask yer Father let go, miss,’ said burglar; ‘’e ‘ave ‘art refuse you.’ ‘If I do,’ said Alice, ‘will promise never come back?’ ‘Not me, miss,’ burglar said earnestly, looked plate-basket again, alone would enough keep away, robber said afterwards. ‘And good rob more?’ said Alice. ‘I turn noo leaf, miss, help me.’ Then Alice said--‘Oh, let go! I sure good.’ But robber said no, would right; must wait till Father came home. Then H. O. said, suddenly plainly: ‘I think fair, robber yourself.’ The minute would said burglar said, ‘Kidded, gum!’--and robber made step towards catch hold him, time think ‘Hullo!’ burglar knocked pistol one hand knocked robber other, window like shot, though Oswald Dicky try stop holding legs. And burglar cheek put head window say, ‘I give yer love kids missis’--and like winking, Alice Dora trying pick robber, asking whether hurt, where. He hurt all, except lump back head. And got up, dusted kitchen floor him. Eliza dirty girl. Then said, ‘Let us put shutters. It never rains pours. Now two burglars I daresay twenty.’ So put shutters, Eliza strict orders goes out, never does, went back Father’s study, robber said, ‘What night having!’ put boots back fender go steaming, talked once. It wonderful adventure ever had, though treasure-seeking--at least ours. I suppose burglar’s treasure-seeking, get much--and robber said believe word kids like Alice me. And click gate, said, ‘Here Father,’ robber said, ‘And police.’ Then jumped up. We like much, seemed unfair sent prison, horrid, lumping big burglar not. And Alice said, ‘Oh, _no_--run! Dicky let back door. Oh, go, go _now_.’ And said, ‘Yes, _go_,’ pulled towards door, gave hat stick things pockets. But Father’s latchkey door, late. Father came quickly, purring cold, began say, ‘It right, Foulkes, I got--’ And stopped short stared us. Then said, voice hate, ‘Children, meaning this?’ And minute nobody spoke. Then Father said, ‘Foulkes, I must really apologize naughty--’ And robber rubbed hands laughed, cried out: ‘You mistaken, dear sir, I Foulkes; I robber, captured young people gallant manner. “Hands up, surrender, I fire,” rest it. My word, Bastable, got kids worth having! I wish Denny pluck.’ Then began understand, like knocked down, sudden. And robber told us robber all. He old college friend Father’s, come dinner, Father trying mend lock H. O. broken, ask Father get letter doctor little boy Denny, ill. And Father gone Heath Vanbrugh Park see rich people knows get letter. And left Mr Foulkes wait till came back, important know whether Father could get letter, could Mr Foulkes would try one else directly. We dumb amazement. Our robber told Father burglar, said sorry would let escape, Father said, ‘Oh, right: poor beggar; really kids home: never tell--forgive us debts, know; tell first business. It must moderately entertaining.’ Then robber told Father I rushed room pistol, crying out... know that. And laid thick fat plucky young-uns, chips old blocks, things like that, I felt I purple shame, even blanket. So I swallowed thing tries prevent speaking ought to, I said, ‘Look here, Father, I really think one study. We thought cat first, I thought one there, I larking. And I said surrender that, game, know?’ Then robber said, ‘Yes, old chap; found really _was_ someone there, dropped pistol bunked, you, eh?’ And I said, ‘No; I thought, “Hullo! robber! Well, up, I suppose, I may well hold see happens.”’ And I glad I would owned up, Father slapped back, said I young brick, robber said I funk anyway, though I got hot blanket I liked it, I explained others would done thought it. Then Father got beer, laughed Dora’s responsibility, got box figs bought us, given us Water Rates, Eliza came brought bread cheese, left neck mutton--cold wreck mutton, Father called it--and feast--like picnic--all sitting anywhere, eating fingers. It prime. We sat till past twelve clock, I never felt pleased think I born girl. It hard others; would done would thought it. But make feel jolly pater says young brick! When Mr Foulkes going, said Alice, ‘Good-bye, Hardy.’ And Alice understood, course, kissed hard could. And said, ‘I wanted to, said one kissed left pirate.’ And said, ‘I know did, dear.’ And Dora kissed too, said, ‘I suppose none tales true?’ And robber said, ‘I tried play part properly, dear.’ And jolly well play it, mistake. We often seen since, boy Denny, girl Daisy, comes another story. And kids read ever two adventures one night write tell me. That all. CHAPTER 14. THE DIVINING-ROD You idea uncomfortable house day sought gold divining-rod. It like spring-cleaning winter-time. All carpets up, Father told Eliza make place decent gentleman coming dinner next day. So got charwoman, slopped water about, left brooms brushes stairs people tumble over. H. O. got big bump head way, said bad, Eliza said keep nursery then, would business. We bandaged head towel, stopped crying played England’s wounded hero dying cockpit, every man duty, hero told to, Alice Hardy, I doctor, others crew. Playing Hardy made us think dear robber, wished there, wondered ever see more. We rather astonished Father’s anyone dinner, never seems think anything business. Before Mother died people often came dinner, Father’s business take much time bother now. And used see could go furthest nightgowns get nice things eat, without seen, dishes came dining-room. Eliza cannot cook nice things. She told Father good plain cook, says fancy portrait. We stayed nursery till charwoman came told us off--she going make one job it, carpet well others, man beat them. It came up, dusty--and found threepenny-bit I lost ages ago, shows Eliza is. H. O. got tired wounded hero, Dicky tired nothing Dora said knew would begin tease Noel minute; course Dicky said going tease anybody--he going Heath. He said would heard nagging women drove man home, found quite true. Oswald always tries peacemaker, told Dicky shut make ass himself. And Alice said, ‘Well, Dora began’--And Dora tossed chin said business Oswald’s way, one asked Alice’s opinion. So felt uncomfortable till Noel said, ‘Do let us quarrel nothing. You know let dogs delight--and I made another piece talking-- Quarrelling evil thing, It fills gall life’s cup; For begin It takes long time make up.’ We laughed stopped jawing other. Noel funny poetry. But piece happened come quite true. You begin quarrel cannot stop; often, long others ready cry make up, I see silly is, I want laugh; say so--for makes others crosser before. I wonder is? Alice said Noel ought poet laureate, actually went cold got laurel leaves--the spotted kind--out garden, Dora made crown put him. He quite pleased; leaves made mess, Eliza said, ‘Do not.’ I believe word grown-ups use other. Then suddenly Alice thought old idea finding treasure, said--‘Do let us try divining-rod.’ So Oswald said, ‘Fair priestess, greatly desire find gold beneath land, therefore pray thee practise divining-rod, tell us find it.’ ‘Do ye desire fashion helms hauberks?’ said Alice. ‘Yes,’ said Noel; ‘and chains ouches.’ ‘I bet know “ouch” is,’ said Dicky. ‘Yes I do, there!’ said Noel. ‘It carcanet. I looked dicker, then!’ We asked carcanet was, would say. ‘And want make fair goblets gold,’ said Oswald. ‘Yes, drink coconut milk of,’ said H. O. ‘And desire build fair palaces it,’ said Dicky. ‘And buy things,’ said Dora; ‘a great many things. New Sunday frocks hats kid gloves and--’ She would gone ever long reminded found gold yet. By Alice put nursery tablecloth, green, tied old blue yellow antimacassar head, said-- ‘If intentions correct, fear nothing follow me.’ And went hall. We followed chanting ‘Heroes.’ It gloomy thing girls learnt High School, always use want priestly chant. Alice stopped short hat-stand, held hands well could tablecloth, said-- ‘Now, great altar golden idol, yield divining-rod I may use good suffering people.’ The umbrella-stand altar golden idol, yielded old school umbrella. She carried palms. ‘Now,’ said, ‘I shall sing magic chant. You must say anything, follow wherever I go--like follow leader, know--and gold underneath magic rod twist hand priestess like live thing seeks free. Then dig, golden treasure revealed. H. O., make clatter boots come tell us to. Now come you.’ So went upstairs every room. We followed tiptoe, Alice sang went. What sang book--Noel made dressing priestess. Ashen rod cold That I hold, Teach find gold. When came Eliza was, said, ‘Get along you’; Dora said game, would touch anything, boots quite clean, Eliza might well let us. So did. It right priestess, little dull rest us, would let us sing, too; said would enough it, could find gold would leave play something else. The priestess said, ‘All right, wait minute,’ went singing. Then followed back nursery, carpet boards smelt soft soap. Then said, ‘It moves, moves! Once choral hymn!’ So sang ‘Heroes’ again, middle umbrella dropped hands. ‘The magic rod spoken,’ said Alice; ‘dig here, courage despatch.’ We quite see dig, began scratch floor hands, priestess said, ‘Do silly! It place come gas. The board’s loose. Dig value lives, ere sundown dragon guards spoil return fiery fury make unresisting prey.’ So dug--that is, got loose board up. And Alice threw arms cried-- ‘See rich treasure--the gold thick layers, silver diamonds stuck it!’ ‘Like currants cake,’ said H. O. ‘It lovely treasure,’ said Dicky yawning. ‘Let us come back carry away another day.’ But Alice kneeling hole. ‘Let feast eyes golden splendour,’ said, ‘hidden long centuries human eye. Behold magic rod led us treasures more--Oswald, push so!--more bright ever monarch--I say, _is_ something there, really. I saw shine!’ We thought kidding, began try get hole, much small, saw meant it, I said, ‘Let us squint,’ I looked, I could see anything, even I lay stomach. The others lay stomachs tried see, Noel, stood looked us said great serpents come drink magic pool. He wanted knight slay great serpents good sword--he even drew umbrella ready--but Alice said, ‘All right, minute. But now--I sure I saw it; get match, Noel, dear.’ ‘What see?’ asked Noel, beginning go matches slowly. ‘Something bright, away corner board beam.’ ‘Perhaps rat’s eye,’ Noel said, ‘or snake’s,’ put heads quite close hole till came back matches. Then I struck match, Alice cried, ‘There is!’ And was, half-sovereign, partly dusty partly bright. We think perhaps mouse, disturbed carpets taken up, may brushed dust years part half-sovereign tail. We cannot imagine came there, Dora thinks remembers H. O. little Mother gave money hold, dropped it, rolled floor. So think perhaps part it. We glad. H. O. wanted go buy mask seen fourpence. It shilling mask, going cheap Guy Fawkes’ Day over, little cracked top. But Dora said, ‘I know money. Let us wait ask Father.’ But H. O. care waiting, I felt him. Dora rather like grown-ups way; seem understand want thing want it, wish wait, even minute. So went asked Albert-next-door’s uncle. He pegging away one rotten novels write make living, said interrupting all. ‘My hero’s folly involved difficulty,’ said. ‘It fault. I leave meditate incredible fatuity--the hare-brained recklessness--which brought pass. It lesson him. I, meantime, give unreservedly pleasures conversation.’ That one thing I like Albert’s uncle for. He always talks like book, yet always understand means. I think like us, inside mind, grown-up people are. He pretend beautifully. I never met anyone else good it, except robber, began it, him. But Albert’s uncle first taught us make people talk like books playing things, made us learn tell story straight beginning, starting middle like people do. So Oswald remembered told, generally does, began beginning, came Alice said priestess, Albert’s uncle said-- ‘Let priestess set forth tale fitting speech.’ So Alice said, ‘O high priest great idol, humblest thy slaves took school umbrella divining-rod, sang song inver--what is-it is-name?’ ‘Invocation perhaps?’ said Albert’s uncle. ‘Yes; I went others got tired, divining-rod fell certain spot, I said, “Dig”, dug--it loose board gas men--and really truly half-sovereign lying boards, is.’ Albert’s uncle took looked it. ‘The great high priest bite see good,’ said, did. ‘I congratulate you,’ went on; ‘you indeed among favoured Immortals. First find half-crowns garden, this. The high priest advises tell Father, ask may keep it. My hero become penitent, impatient. I must pull scrape. Ye leave depart.’ Of course know Kipling means, ‘You would better bunk, sharp it,’ came away. I like Albert’s uncle. I shall like I man. He gave us Jungle books, awfully clever, though write grown-up tales. We told Father night. He kind. He said might certainly half-sovereign, hoped enjoy treasure-trove. Then said, ‘Your dear Mother’s Indian Uncle coming dinner to-morrow night. So drag furniture overhead, please, absolutely obliged; H. O. might wear slippers something. I always distinguish note H. O.’s boots.’ We said would quiet, Father went on-- ‘This Indian Uncle used children, coming talk business me. It really important quiet. Do think, Dora, perhaps bed six H. O. Noel--’ But H. O. said, ‘Father, I really truly make noise. I stand head evening sooner disturb Indian Uncle boots.’ And Alice said Noel never made row anyhow. So Father laughed said, ‘All right.’ And said might liked half-sovereign. ‘Only goodness’ sake try go business it,’ said. ‘It always mistake go business insufficient capital.’ We talked evening, decided go business half-sovereign use spending once, might well right royal feast. The next day went bought things. We got figs, almonds raisins, real raw rabbit, Eliza promised cook us would wait till tomorrow, Indian Uncle coming dinner. She busy cooking nice things eat. We got rabbit tired beef mutton, Father bill poultry shop. And got flowers go dinner-table Father’s party. And got hardbake raspberry noyau peppermint rock oranges coconut, nice things. We put top long drawer. It H. O.’s play drawer, made turn things put Father’s old portmanteau. H. O. getting old enough learn unselfish, besides, drawer wanted tidying badly. Then vowed honour ancient House Bastable would touch feast till Dora gave word next day. And gave H. O. hardbake, make easier keep vow. The next day rememorable day lives, know then. But another story. I think useful way know cannot think end chapter. I learnt another writer named Kipling. I mentioned before, I believe, deserves it! CHAPTER 15. ‘LO, THE POOR INDIAN!’ It well Father ask us make row Indian Uncle coming talk business, young brother’s boots things make noise. We took boots away made wear Dora’s bath slippers, soft woolly, hardly soles them; course wanted see Uncle, looked banisters came, quiet mice--but Eliza let went straight kitchen made awful row ever heard, sounded like Day judgement, saucepans crockery house kicked floor, told afterwards tea-tray one two cups saucers, knocked flurry. We heard Uncle say, ‘God bless soul!’ went Father’s study door shut--we see properly time. I believe dinner nice. Something got burned I sure--for smelt it. It extra smell, besides mutton. I know got burned. Eliza would us kitchen except Dora--till dinner over. Then got left dessert, stairs--just round corner cannot see hall, unless first landing gas lighted. Suddenly study door opened Uncle came went felt greatcoat pocket. It cigar-case wanted. We saw afterwards. We got much better view then. He look like Indian like kind brown, big Englishman, course see us, heard mutter himself-- ‘Shocking bad dinner! Eh!--what?’ When went back study shut door properly. That door always little tiresome since day took lock get pencil sharpener H. O. shoved keyhole. We listen--really truly--but Indian Uncle big voice, Father going beaten poor Indian talking anything else--so spoke too, like man, I heard say good business, wanted little capital--and said imposition learned, hated say it. The Uncle said, ‘Pooh, pooh!’ that, said afraid business wanted capital management. Then I heard Father say, ‘It pleasant subject: I sorry I introduced it. Suppose change it, sir. Let fill glass.’ Then poor Indian said something vintage--and poor, broken-down man like could careful. And Father said, ‘Well, whisky then,’ afterwards talked Native Races Imperial something got dull. So Oswald remembered must hear people intend hear--even listening said, ‘We ought stay longer. Perhaps would like us hear--’ Alice said, ‘Oh, think could possibly matter?’ went shut study door softly quite tight. So use staying longer, went nursery. Then Noel said, ‘Now I understand. Of course Father making banquet Indian, poor, broken-down man. We might known “Lo, poor Indian!” know.’ We agreed him, glad thing explained, understood Father wanted people dinner for--and let us come in. ‘Poor people proud,’ said Alice, ‘and I expect Father thought Indian would ashamed, us children knew poor was.’ Then Dora said, ‘Poverty disgrace. We honour honest Poverty.’ And agreed so. ‘I wish dinner nasty,’ Dora said, Oswald put lumps coal fire fingers, make noise. He thoughtful boy, wipe fingers trouser leg perhaps Noel H. O. would done, rubbed Dora’s handkerchief talking. ‘I afraid dinner horrid.’ Dora went on. ‘The table looked nice flowers got. I set myself, Eliza made borrow silver spoons forks Albert-next-door’s Mother.’ ‘I hope poor Indian honest,’ said Dicky gloomily, ‘when poor, broken-down man silver spoons must great temptation.’ Oswald told talk tommy-rot Indian relation, course could anything dishonourable. And Dora said right way, washed spoons forks counted them, there, put wash-leather bag, taken back Albert-next-door’s Mother. ‘And brussels sprouts wet swimmy,’ went on, ‘and potatoes looked grey--and bits black gravy--and mutton bluey-red soft middle. I saw came out. The apple-pie looked nice--but quite done apply part. The thing burnt--you must smelt it, soup.’ ‘It pity,’ said Oswald; ‘I suppose gets good dinner every day.’ ‘No we,’ said H. O., ‘but shall to-morrow.’ I thought things bought half-sovereign--the rabbit sweets almonds raisins figs coconut: I thought nasty mutton things, I thinking Alice said-- ‘Let us ask poor Indian come dinner _us_ to-morrow.’ I said given time. We got little ones go bed promising put note dressing-table saying happened, might know first thing morning, middle night happened wake up, elders arranged everything. I waited back door, Uncle beginning go Dicky drop marble banisters signal, I could run round meet Uncle came out. This seems like deceit, thoughtful considerate boy understand could go say Uncle hall Father’s eye, ‘Father given beastly, nasty dinner, come dinner us tomorrow, show idea good things eat.’ You see, think over, would polite Father. So Uncle left, Father saw door let out, went back study, looking sad, Dora says. As poor Indian came steps saw gate. I mind poor, I said, ‘Good evening, Uncle,’ politely though ascend one gilded chariots rich affluent, instead walk station quarter mile mud, unless money tram fare. ‘Good evening, Uncle.’ I said again, stood staring me. I suppose used politeness boys--some boys anything but--especially Aged Poor. So I said, ‘Good evening, Uncle,’ yet again. Then said-- ‘Time bed, young man. Eh!--what?’ Then I saw I must speak plainly him, man man. So I did. I said-- ‘You dining Father, could help hearing say dinner shocking. So thought Indian, perhaps poor’--I like tell heard dreadful truth lips, I went on, ‘because “Lo, poor Indian”--you know--and cannot get good dinner every day. And sorry poor; come dinner us to-morrow--with us children, I mean? It very, good dinner--rabbit, hardbake, coconut--and need mind us knowing poor, know honourable poverty disgrace, and--’ I could gone much longer, interrupted say--‘Upon word! And name, eh?’ ‘Oswald Bastable,’ I said; I hope people reading story guessed I Oswald time. ‘Oswald Bastable, eh? Bless soul!’ said poor Indian. ‘Yes, I dine you, Mr Oswald Bastable, pleasure life. Very kind cordial invitation, I sure. Good night, sir. At one clock, I presume?’ ‘Yes, one,’ I said. ‘Good night, sir.’ Then I went told others, wrote paper put boy’s dressing-table, said-- ‘The poor Indian coming one. He seemed grateful kindness.’ We tell Father Uncle coming dinner us, polite reason I explained before. But tell Eliza; said friend coming dinner wanted everything nice. I think thought Albert-next-door, good temper day, agreed cook rabbit make pudding currants it. And one clock came Indian Uncle came too. I let helped greatcoat, furry inside, took straight nursery. We dinner usual, decided first would enjoy made stranger of. We agreed treat one ourselves, polite, might think pride poor. He shook hands us asked ages, schools went to, shook head said holiday now. I felt rather uncomfortable--I always talk schools--and I could think anything say show meant treat one ourselves. I ask played cricket. He said played lately. And one said anything till dinner came in. We washed faces hands brushed hair came in, looked nice, especially Oswald, hair cut morning. When Eliza brought rabbit gone again, looked silent despair, like books. It seemed going dull dinner like one poor Indian night before; only, course, things eat would nicer. Dicky kicked Oswald table make say something--and new boots on, too!--but Oswald kick back; Uncle asked-- ‘Do carve, sir, shall I?’ Suddenly Alice said-- ‘Would like grown-up dinner, Uncle, play-dinner?’ He hesitate moment, said, ‘Play-dinner, means. Eh!--what?’ knew right. So showed Uncle dauntless hunter. The rabbit deer slain green forest trusty yew bows, toasted joints it, Uncle carved it, bits firewood sharpened point. The Uncle’s piece got little burnt, said delicious, said game always nicer killed yourself. When Eliza taken away rabbit bones brought pudding, waited till gone shut door, put dish floor slew pudding dish good old-fashioned way. It wild boar bay, hard indeed kill, even forks. The Uncle fierce indeed pudding, jumped howled speared it, came turn helped, said, ‘No, thank you; think liver. Eh!--what?’ But almonds raisins--when climbed top chest drawers pluck boughs great trees; fig cargo rich merchants brought ship--the long drawer ship--and rest us sweets coconut. It glorious beautiful feast, said hoped better dinner last night. And said: ‘I never enjoyed dinner more.’ He polite say really thought Father’s dinner. And saw though might poor, true gentleman. He smoked cigar finished left eat, told us tiger shooting elephants. We asked wigwams, wampum, mocassins, beavers, seem know, else shy talking wonders native land. We liked much indeed, going last, Alice nudged me, I said--‘There one threepence farthing left half-sovereign. Will take it, please, like much indeed, want it, really; would rather it.’ And I put money hand. ‘I take threepenny-bit,’ said, turning money looking it, ‘but I could rob rest. By way, get money royal spread--half sovereign said--eh, what?’ We told different ways looked treasure, telling time sat down, listen better last told Alice played divining-rod, really found half-sovereign. Then said would like see again. But explained rod would show gold silver, quite sure gold house, happened looked carefully. ‘Well, silver, then,’ said he; ‘let us hide plate-basket, little Alice shall make divining-rod find it. Eh!--what?’ ‘There silver plate-basket now,’ Dora said. ‘Eliza asked borrow silver spoons forks dinner last night Albert-next-door’s Mother. Father never notices, thought would nicer you. Our silver went dents taken out; I think Father could afford pay man it, silver come back.’ ‘Bless soul!’ said Uncle again, looking hole big chair burnt Guy Fawkes’ Day indoors. ‘And much pocket-money get? Eh!--what?’ ‘We now,’ said Alice; ‘but indeed want shilling. We would much rather it, would we?’ And rest us said, ‘Yes.’ The Uncle would take it, asked lot questions, last went away. And went said-- ‘Well, youngsters, I enjoyed much. I shall forget kind hospitality. Perhaps poor Indian may position ask dinner day.’ Oswald said ever could like come much, trouble get nice dinner ours, could well cold mutton rice pudding. We like things, Oswald knows behave. Then poor Indian went away. We got treasure party, good time, I sure Uncle enjoyed himself. We sorry gone could none us eat much tea; mind, pleased poor Indian enjoyed too. Besides, Dora said, ‘A contented mind continual feast,’ matter wanting tea. Only H. O. seem think continual feast contented mind, Eliza gave powder left red-currant jelly Father nasty dinner. But rest us quite well, I think must coconut H. O. We hoped nothing disagreed Uncle, never knew. CHAPTER 16. THE END OF THE TREASURE-SEEKING Now coming near end treasure-seeking, end wonderful nothing like used be. It like fortunes earthquake, those, know, everything comes wrong-way up. The day Uncle speared pudding us opened gloom sadness. But never know. It destined day things happened. Yet sign appeared early morning. Then misery upsetness. None us felt quite well; I know why: Father one awful colds, Dora persuaded go London, stay cosy warm study, made gruel. She makes better Eliza does; Eliza’s gruel little lumps, suck dry oatmeal inside. We kept quiet could, I made H. O. lessons, like G. B. advised us to. But dull. There days seem got end things could ever possibly happen you, feel spend rest life dull things way. Days like generally wet days. But, I said, never know. Then Dicky said things went like run away sea, Alice said thought would rather nice go convent. H. O. little disagreeable powder Eliza given him, tried read two books once, one eye, Noel wanted one books, selfish him, made headache worse. H. O. getting old enough learn experience wrong selfish, complained head Oswald told whose fault was, I older is, duty show wrong. But began cry, Oswald cheer Father wanting quiet. So Oswald said-- ‘They eat H. O. look out!’ And Dora said Oswald bad. Of course Oswald going interfere again, went look window see trams go by, H. O. came looked too, Oswald, knows generous forgiving, gave piece blue pencil two nibs, good new, keep. As looking rain splashing stones street saw four-wheeled cab come lumbering way station is. Oswald called out-- ‘Here comes coach Fairy Godmother. It stop here, see not!’ So came window look. Oswald said stopping stricken wonder amaze cab really stop. It boxes top knobby parcels sticking window, something like going away seaside something like gentleman takes things carriage wooden shutters up, sell drapers’ shops. The cabman got down, one inside handed ever many parcels different shapes sizes, cabman stood holding arms grinning them. Dora said, ‘It pity one tell house.’ And inside cab one put foot feeling step, like tortoise’s foot coming holding ground, leg came parcels, Noel cried-- ‘It poor Indian!’ And was. Eliza opened door, leaning banisters. Father heard noise parcels boxes hall, came without remembering bad cold was. If cold call careless naughty. Then heard poor Indian say Father-- ‘I say, Dick, I dined kids yesterday--as I daresay told you. Jolliest little cubs I ever saw! Why let see night? The eldest image poor Janey--and young Oswald, man! If man, I nigger! Eh!--what? And Dick, I say, I wonder I could find friend put bit business yours--eh?’ Then Father went study door shut--and went looked parcels. Some done old, dirty newspapers, tied bits rag, brown paper string shops, boxes. We wondered Uncle come stay luggage, whether sell. Some smelt spices, like merchandise--and one bundle Alice felt certain bale. We heard hand knob study door bit, Alice said-- ‘Fly!’ got away H. O., Uncle caught leg trying get upstairs us. ‘Peeping baggage, eh?’ said Uncle, rest us came would dishonourable leave H. O. alone scrape, wanted see parcels. ‘I touch,’ said H. O. ‘Are coming stay? I hope are.’ ‘No harm done touch,’ said good, kind, Indian man us. ‘For parcels _for you_.’ I several times told dumb amazement terror joy, things like that, I never remember us dumber said this. The Indian Uncle went on: ‘I told old friend mine pleasant dinner I you, threepenny-bit, divining-rod, that, sent odds ends presents you. Some things came India.’ ‘Have come India, Uncle?’ Noel asked; said ‘Yes’ much surprised, never thought sort Indian. We thought Red kind, course accounted ignorance beavers things. He got Eliza help, took parcels nursery undid undid undid them, till papers lay thick floor. Father came sat Guy Fawkes chair. I cannot begin tell things kind friend Uncle’s sent us. He must agreeable person. There toys kids model engines Dick me, lot books, Japanese china tea-sets girls, red white gold--there sweets pound box--and long yards yards soft silk India, make frocks girls--and real Indian sword Oswald book Japanese pictures Noel, ivory chess men Dicky: castles chessmen elephant-and-castles. There railway station called that; I never knew meant before. The brown paper string parcels boxes games them--and big cases preserved fruits things. And shabby old newspaper parcels boxes Indian things in. I never saw many beautiful things before. There carved fans silver bangles strings amber beads, necklaces uncut gems--turquoises garnets, Uncle said were--and shawls scarves silk, cabinets brown gold, ivory boxes silver trays, brass things. The Uncle kept saying, ‘This you, young man,’ ‘Little Alice like fan,’ ‘Miss Dora would look well green silk, I think. Eh!--what?’ And Father looked dream, till Uncle suddenly gave ivory paper-knife box cigars, said, ‘My old friend sent these, Dick; old friend too, says.’ And winked Father, H. O. I saw him. And Father winked back, though always told us to. That wonderful day. It treasure, mistake! I never saw heaps heaps presents, like things fairy-tale--and even Eliza shawl. Perhaps deserved it, cook rabbit pudding; Oswald says fault nose turns brush hair. I think Eliza likes brushing things. It carpets. But Oswald tries make allowances even people wash ears. The Indian Uncle came see us often that, friend always sent us something. Once tipped us sovereign each--the Uncle brought it; sent us money go Crystal Palace, Uncle took us; another time circus; Christmas near Uncle said-- ‘You remember I dined you, time ago, promised dine day, I could ever afford give dinner-party. Well, I going one--a Christmas party. Not Christmas Day, every one goes home then--but day after. Cold mutton rice pudding. You come? Eh!--what?’ We said delighted, Father objection, proper thing say, poor Indian, I mean Uncle, said, ‘No, Father object--he coming too, bless soul!’ We got Christmas presents Uncle. The girls made handkerchief case comb bag, pieces silk given them. I got knife three blades; H. O. got siren whistle, strong one, Dicky joined knife, Noel would give Indian ivory box Uncle’s friend sent wonderful Fairy Cab day. He said nicest thing had, sure Uncle would mind bought money. I think Father’s business must got better--perhaps Uncle’s friend put money good, like feeding starving. Anyway new suits, girls green silk India made frocks, Boxing Day went two cabs--Father girls one, us boys other. We wondered much Indian Uncle lived, told. And thought cab began go hill towards Heath perhaps Uncle lived one poky little houses top Greenwich. But cab went right Heath big gates, shrubbery white frost like fairy forest, Christmas time. And last stopped one jolly, big, ugly red houses lot windows, comfortable inside, steps Indian Uncle, looking big grand, blue cloth coat yellow sealskin waistcoat, bunch seals hanging it. ‘I wonder whether taken place butler here?’ said Dicky. ‘A poor, broken-down man--’ Noel thought likely, knew big houses always thousands stately butlers. The Uncle came steps opened cab door himself, I think butlers would expect do. And took us in. It lovely hall, bear tiger skins floor, big clock faces sun moon dodging day night, Father Time scythe coming hours, name ‘Flint. Ashford. 1776’; fox eating stuffed duck glass case, horns stags animals doors. ‘We come study first,’ said Uncle, ‘and wish Merry Christmas.’ So knew butler, must house, master house study. His study much like Father’s. It hardly books, swords guns newspapers great many boots, boxes half unpacked, Indian things bulging them. We gave presents awfully pleased. Then gave us Christmas presents. You must tired hearing presents, I must remark Uncle’s presents watches; watch us, names engraved inside, silver except H. O.’s, Waterbury, ‘To match boots,’ Uncle said. I know meant. Then Uncle looked Father, Father said, ‘You tell them, sir.’ So Uncle coughed stood made speech. He said-- ‘Ladies gentlemen, met together discuss important subject weeks engrossed attention honourable member opposite myself.’ I said, ‘Hear, hear,’ Alice whispered, ‘What happened guinea-pig?’ Of course know answer that. The Uncle went on-- ‘I going live house, rather big me, Father agreed shall come live me. And so, agreeable, going live together, and, please God, happy home us all. Eh!--what?’ He blew nose kissed us round. As Christmas I mind, though I much old dates. Then said, ‘Thank much presents; I got present I value anything else I have.’ I thought quite polite say so, till I saw valued much threepenny-bit watch-chain, and, course, I saw must one given him. He said, ‘You children gave thought I poor Indian, I keep long I live. And I asked friends help us jolly, house-warming. Eh!--what?’ Then shook Father hand, blew noses; Father said, ‘Your Uncle kind--most--’ But Uncle interrupted saying, ‘Now, Dick, nonsense!’ Then H. O. said, ‘Then poor all?’ disappointed. The Uncle replied, ‘I enough simple wants, thank you, H. O.; Father’s business provide enough yours. Eh!--what?’ Then went looked fox thoroughly, made Uncle take glass could see round Uncle took us house, comfortable one I ever in. There beautiful portrait Mother Father’s sitting-room. The Uncle must rich indeed. This ending like happens Dickens’s books; I think much jollier happen like book, shows nice man Uncle is, way all. Think flat would Uncle said, first offered one threepence farthing, ‘Oh, I want dirty one three-pence! I rich indeed.’ Instead saved news wealth till Christmas, told us one glorious burst. Besides, I cannot help like Dickens, happens way. Real life often something like books. Presently, seen house, taken drawing-room, Mrs Leslie, gave us shillings wished us good hunting, Lord Tottenham, Albert-next-door’s Uncle--and Albert-next-door, Mother (I fond her), best Robber two kids, Robber new suit on. The Uncle told us asked people kind us, Noel said, ‘Where noble editor I wrote poetry to?’ The Uncle said courage ask strange editor dinner; Lord Tottenham old friend Uncle’s, introduced Uncle Mrs Leslie, pride pleasure welcoming house-warming. And made bow like see Christmas card. Then Alice asked, ‘What Mr Rosenbaum? He kind; would pleasant surprise him.’ But everybody laughed, Uncle said-- ‘Your father paid sovereign lent you. I think could borne another pleasant surprise.’ And I said butcher, really kind; laughed, Father said could ask business friends private dinner. Then dinner-time, thought Uncle’s talk cold mutton rice. But beautiful dinner, I never saw dessert! We plates take away another sitting-room, much jollier sitting round table grown-ups. But Robber’s kids stayed Father. They shy frightened, said hardly anything, looked bright eyes. H. O. thought like white mice; afterwards got know well, end mousy. And good deal interesting stuff tell them; I shall put another book, room one. We played desert islands afternoon drank Uncle’s health ginger wine. It H. O. upset Alice’s green silk dress, never even rowed him. Brothers ought favourites, Oswald would never mean favourite sister, or, had, wild horses make tell was. And go living big house Heath, jolly. Mrs Leslie often comes see us, Robber Albert-next-door’s uncle. The Indian Uncle likes India brown; Uncle like Albert-next-door. He says muff. And I go Rugby, Noel H. O., perhaps Balliol afterwards. Balliol Father’s college. It two separate coats arms, many colleges allowed. Noel going poet Dicky wants go Father’s business. The Uncle real good old sort; think, never found made minds Treasure Seekers! Noel made poem it-- Lo! poor Indian lands afar, Comes treasure seekers are; We looked treasure, find The best treasure Uncle good kind. I thought rather rot, Alice would show Uncle, liked much. He kissed Alice smacked Noel back, said, ‘I think I done badly either, come that, though I never regular professional treasure seeker. Eh!--what?’
