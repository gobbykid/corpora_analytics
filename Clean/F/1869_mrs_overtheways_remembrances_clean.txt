 MRS. OVERTHEWAY'S REMEMBRANCES IDA. ... "Thou shall lack The flower like thy face, pale Primrose." _Cymbeline._ The little old lady lived way, green gate shut click, three white steps. Every morning eight clock church bell chimed Morning Prayer--chim! chime! chim! chime!--and every morning eight clock little old lady came white steps, opened gate click, went bells calling. About time also little Ida would kneel chair nursery window opposite house watch old lady come go. The old lady one people look always same. Every morning cheeks looked like faded rose-leaves, white hair like snow-wreath garden laughing last tea-rose. Every morning wore black satin bonnet, white shawl; delicate gloves smallest hands, gathered skirt daintily smallest feet. Every morning carried clean pocket-handkerchief, fresh rose hand Prayer-book; Prayer-book, bound Bible, thick, seemed difficulty doing. Every morning, whatever weather might be, stood outside green gate, looked sky see clear, ground see dry; went bells calling. Ida knew little old lady quite well sight, know name. Perhaps Ida's great-uncle knew it; grave, unsociable man, saw little neighbours, perhaps not; Ida stood much awe trouble idle questions. She asked Nurse, Nurse know; quiet orphan child asked more. She made name little old lady herself, however, manner Mr. John Bunyan, called Mrs. Overtheway; morning morning, though bread-and-milk breakfast smoked upon table, would linger window, beseeching-- "One minute more, dear Nurse! Please let wait till Mrs. Overtheway gone church." And little old lady come gone, Ida would creep perch, begin breakfast. Then, chimes went till half basinful eaten, little Ida would nod head contentedly, whisper-- "Mrs. Overtheway time." Little Ida's history sad one. Her troubles began year old, greatest earthly losses--for mother died, leaving sailor husband infant child. The sea-captain could face danger, empty home; went back winds waves, leaving little daughter relations. Six long years away, Ida many homes, yet, somehow, home, one day postman brought large letter, name written upon large hand. This old envelope sealed again--no make-believe epistle put post nursery door: real letter, real seal, real stamps, great many post-marks; Ida opened two sheets written Captain's hand, round fat characters, easy read, sketch Captain's ship top, and--most welcome all!--the news Captain's self coming home. "I shall papa soon, Nurse," said Ida. "He written letter me, made picture ship; 'Bonne Esperance,' says means Good Hope. I love letter better anything ever sent me." Nevertheless, Ida took carved fans workboxes, beads, handkerchiefs, feathers, dainty foreign treasures sailor-father sent time time; dusted them, kissed them, told Captain coming home. But letter wore pocket day, kept pillow night. "Why put letter one boxes, like tidy young lady, Miss Ida?" said Nurse. "You wear bits do." "It last till ship comes home," said Miss Ida. It need written rock, graven iron pen ever; "Bonne Esperance" (like earthly hopes) perished return more. She foundered homeward voyage, went great waters, whilst Ida slept stormy night, Captain's letter beneath pillow. Alas! Alas! Alas! * * * * * Two three months passed away since Ida became orphan. She become accustomed crape-hung frock; learnt read Captain's letter memorial good hope pleased God disappoint; fairly happy again. It midst new desolation lonely life come stay great-uncle, begun watch doings little old lady lived way. When dolls seemed vanity, Noah's Ark burden, quiet amusement, demanding exertion, see little could see old lady's life, speculate could not; wonder fancy Mrs. Overtheway looked like without bonnet, church. Ida's imagination carry far. She believed friend old, immeasurably old, indefinitely old; secret faith never otherwise. She felt sure wore cap indoors, nicer one Nurse's; real tea, sugar cream, instead milk-and-water, hot toast rather bread-and-treacle tea; helped meals, went bed according pleasure convenience; was--perhaps grounds--utterly happy, always so. "I little girl," said Ida, pressed face sadly cold window-pane. "I little girl, sad, know, Papa drowned sea; Mrs. Overtheway old, always happy, I love her." And philosophy truth. It mistake suppose happiness others always distasteful sight sad heart. There times life seems shorn interests bereaved pleasure, relief, almost amounting consolation, believe one happy. It feeling nature, perhaps, makes young attractive old. It soothes like sound harmonious music, sight harmonious beauty. It witnesses conviction lying deep even afflicted souls (come may), things created good, man made blessed; sorrow sighing flee away. This one many things formed attraction Ida little old lady lived way. That green gate shut life child knew nothing, might one mysterious delights; believe things could consoling, imagine real entertainment. Ida would sometimes draw chair quietly table beside own, fancy Mrs. Overtheway tea her. She would ask old lady time church morning, beg take bonnet, apologise politely want hot tea toast. So far well, Ida could answer remarks Mrs. Overtheway's behalf; may believed certain point one-sided conversation flagged. One day Nurse overheard Ida's low murmurs. "What talking about, Miss Ida?" said she. "I pretending Mrs. Overtheway tea," said Ida. "Little girls pretend true," replied Nurse, whose philosophy fancy falsehood distinguished. "Play dolls, dear, move chairs places." With Nurse carried chair corner naughty child, Ida gave day-dream sigh; since prolonged fancy Mrs. Overtheway present, must imagined borne crisis meal fashion altogether consistent old lady's dignity. Summer passed, winter came on. There days white steps looked whiter usual; snowdrift came halfway little green gate, snowflakes came softly persistency threatened bury whole town. Ida knew days Mrs. Overtheway could go out; whenever tolerably fine old lady appeared usual, came daintily steps, went bells calling. Chim! chime! chim! chime! They sounded near frosty air, Ida could almost fancied church coming round snowy streets pick congregation. Mrs. Overtheway looked much winter summer. She seemed fresh lively ever, carried Prayer-book handkerchief hand, warmly wrapped up, wore fur-lined boots, charming. There one change, however, went Ida's heart. The little old lady longer flower take church her. At Christmas took sprig holly, spray myrtle, Ida felt poor substitutes rose. She knew Mrs. Overtheway flowers somewhere, true, certain pots forced hyacinths passed little green gate Christmas church decorations; one's winter garden precious cropped recklessly summer rose-bushes, old lady went flowerless church enjoyed bulbs home. But change went Ida's heart. Spring early year. At beginning February good deal snow ground, true, air became milder milder, towards end month came real spring day, snow gone. "You may go play garden, Miss Ida," said Nurse, Ida went. She kept indoors long time weather cold, pleasant get again, even amusement run shingly walks wonder soon might begin garden, whether gardener could induced give piece ground sufficiently extensive grow crop mustard-and-cress form capital I. It kitchen garden Ida sent. At far end cut world overgrown hedge large gaps bottom, Ida could see high road, trough watering horses, beyond wood. The hedge thin February, Ida good view consequence, sitting stump sunshine peered gap see horses came drink. It good peep-show, indeed much better. "The snow melted," gurgled water, "here I am." It everywhere. The sunshine made rich green mosses look dry, reality wet, everything else. Slish! slosh! Put feet would, water everywhere. It filled stone trough, which, old grey steady, kept still, bade reflect blue sky gorgeous mosses; trough soon overflowed, water slipped side, ran wayside stream. "Winter gone!" spluttered ran. "Winter gone, winter-is-gone, winterisgone!" And, principle good thing cannot said often, went summer, till next winter came stopped mouth icicles. As stream chattered, birds wood sang--Tweet! tweet! chirrup! throstle! Spring! Spring! Spring!--and twittered tree tree, shook bare twigs melody; whilst single blackbird sitting still upon bough below, sang "Life!" "Life!" "Life!" loudest pipe throat, day happiness alive. It like wonderful fairy-tale, Ida listened clasped hands. Presently another song came wood: hymn sung children's voices, one often hears carolled troop little urchins coming home school. The words fell familiarly Ida's ears: "Quite streets silver sound, The flood life doth flow; Upon whose banks every side The wood life doth grow. "Thy gardens thy gallant walks Continually green; There grow sweet pleasant flowers As nowhere else seen. "There trees evermore bear fruit, And evermore spring; There evermore Angels sit, And evermore sing." Here little chorus broke off, children came pouring wood chattering laughter. Only one lingered, playing tree, finishing song. The child's voice rose shrill clear like blackbird him. He also sang Life--Eternal life--knowing little bird meaning song, little less devotion innocence happiness praise. But Ida ceased listen singing. Her whole attention given children scampered past hedge, dropping bits moss fungi like woodland spoil. For, tightly held grubby hands each--plucked reckless indifference bud stalk, fading fast hot prisons--were primroses. Ida started feet, sudden idea filling brain. The birds right, Spring come, flowers--_flowers Mrs. Overtheway_. Ida quiet, obedient little girl, general rule; indeed, lonely life small temptation pranks mischief kind. She often sent play back garden before, never thought straying beyond limits; to-day strong new feeling awakened sight primroses. "The hole large," said Ida, looking gap hedge; "if dead root middle pulled up, would wonderfully large." She pulled root up, and, though wonderful strong term, hole certainly larger. "It big enough put one's head through," said Ida, and, stooping down, exemplified truth observation. "Where head goes, body follow," say, Ida's little body soon side hedge; adage says nothing clothes, however, part Ida's dress left behind. It caught stump scrambled through. But accidents happen, road, something. "It like going world seek one's fortune," thought; "thus Gerda went look little Kay, Joringel sought enchanted flower. One always comes wood." And wood came. Dame Nature laid new green carpets, everything looked lovely; but, said, certainly damp. The little singer tree cared this, however, blackbird him. "Will tell me, please, got primroses?" asked Ida. The child made quaint, half-military salute; smiled. "Yonder," said laconically, and, pointing wood, went song could understand: "Ah, sweet home, Jerusalem, Would God I thee! Would God woes end, Thy joys I might see!" Ida went on, looking ran. Presently wood sloped downwards, pretty steeply, somewhat scramble; yet still kept sharp look-out, primroses see, except upon ground, plucked close poor heads held anybody's hands. These showed way, however, Ida picked sheer pity carried her. "This Hop-of-my-Thumb found way home," thought. At bottom hill ran little brook, opposite side brook bank, top bank hedge, hedge primroses. But brook between! Ida looked hesitated. It wide jump across, here, elsewhere, water usual. To turn back, however, question. Gerda would daunted search coming stream, would one else ever read fairy tales. It true Fairy-land advantages cannot always reckoned upon commonplace children commonplace world. When straw, coal, bean came rivulet travels, straw laid across bridge others, coal degree hot unlucky occasion, might (for anything Ida knew contrary) still pursuing journey favourable circumstances. But travelling-companion expands bridge emergency met every day; poor Ida--she alone. She stood first one leg, other, looked water, primroses, water again, last perceived one place large, flat, moss-covered stone middle stream, stood well water, which--could reach it--she might scramble opposite bank. But reach it? nice, large, secure, comfortable-looking stone. "I must put stones," thought Ida. There plenty stream, Ida dragged up, began make ford piling together. It chilly work, cloud come sun; Ida little bit frightened fresh-water shrimps, queer, many-legged beasts, shot stones lifted them. At last ford complete. Ida stepped daintily bridge made, jumped triumphantly big stone. Alas! trusting appearances. The stone looked firm, insecurely balanced below, first shock one side went splash, Ida went it. What triumph shrimps! She scrambled bank, however, made charming bunch primroses, turned go home. Never mind got back across brook. We waded streams now, good fun June, rather chilly work February; and, spite running home, Ida trembled much cold excitement stood last Mrs. Overtheway's green gate. Click! Ida went white steps, marking sadly wet feet, gave valiant rap. The door opened, tall, rather severe-looking housekeeper asked: "What want, dear?" A shyness, amounting terror, seized upon Ida, could hardly find voice answer. "If please, I brought for--" For whom? Ida's pale face burnt crimson remembered know little old lady's name. Perhaps severe housekeeper touched sight black frock, torn was, said kindly: "Do frightened, dear. What want?" "These primroses," said Ida, almost choking. "They Mrs. Overtheway take church her. I sorry, please, I know name, I call Mrs. Overtheway because, know, lives way. At least--" Ida added, looking back across road sudden confusion ideas, "at least--I mean--you know--_we_ live way." And overwhelmed shame stupidity, Ida stuffed flowers woman's hand, ran home lion heels. "Well! Miss Ida," began Nurse, Ida opened nursery door (and something terrible "well"); "if I ever--" Nurse seized Ida arm, generally premonitory favourite method punishment--"a good shaking." But Ida clung close flung arms round Nurse's neck. "Do shake me, Nursey, dear," begged, "my head aches so. I naughty, I know. I done everything think of; I crept hedge, right wood, made ford, tumbled brook, waded back, run way home, round town fear see me. And I done something could never, never think tried till next Christmas, I got flowers Mrs. Overtheway, I stupidly; think perfect goose, perhaps angry," tears came Ida's eyes. "She think naughty, troublesome child, are," said Nurse, seldom hesitated assume responsibility statement appeared desirable; "you mad old lady, I think. Just look dress!" Ida looked, tears falling much fast clear view anything, torn edges rent seemed fringed prismatic colours. To crown sent bed. In reality, save necessity wearing best frock till mended, also keep warm case caught cold; Nurse spoke punishment, Ida wept accordingly. And triumph uncommon line nursery policy consists elaborately misleading infant mind good. Chim! chime! went bells next morning, Mrs. Overtheway came white steps green gate bunch primroses hand. She looked usual, sky. She looked windows houses way, expected one looking her. There face seen, however; house directly opposite, one upper blinds drawn down. Ida ill. How long ill, matter her, Ida clear idea. She visions toiling wood again, looking vainly something could never found; suddenly surrounded cut swollen streams; crawling, unclean beasts preternatural feelers got boots. Then heavy dreams cleared away part, stream seemed ripple like sound church bells, chimed old tune "Quite streets, silver sound," &c. And then, last, awoke one fine morning hear sweet chim-chiming church bells, see Nurse sitting bedside. She lay still moments make quite sure, asked voice faint surprised herself: "Has Mrs. Overtheway gone church?" On which, great astonishment, Nurse burst tears. For first reasonable sentence poor Ida spoken several days. To ill pleasant; slow process getting back strength often less pleasant still. One afternoon Ida knelt old place window. She up, might go out, great grief. The day provokingly fine, even now, though sun setting, seemed inclined make fresh start, bright rejuvenated glow shone upon opposite houses, threw mystic glory Mrs. Overtheway's white steps green railings. Oh! Ida wished go afternoon! How long clear shadows were! It seemed Ida whoever free go open air could nothing desire. "Out doors" looked like Paradise drooping little maid, passers-by seemed go sunny street golden dream. Ida gazed till shadows lengthened, crept street houses; till sunlight died upon railings, upon steps, last lingered half hour bright patches among chimney-stacks, went altogether, left world shade. Twilight came Ida sat fire, rose importance sunshine gone; and, moreover, spring evenings cold. Ida felt desolate, and, whole, rather ill-used. Nurse upstairs hours, though promised real tea toast evening, signs either yet. The poor child felt weak play, reading made eyes ache. If one tell story. It grew dark, steps came outside door, fumbling lock made Ida nervous. "Do come in, Nursey!" cried. The door opened, someone spoke; voice voice Nurse. It sweet, clear, gentle voice; musical, though longer young; voice one seldom hears never forgets, came darkness, saying: "It Nurse, dear; making tea, gave leave come alone. I Mrs. Overtheway." And firelight stood little old lady, described, except instead Prayer-book carried large pot hyacinth two hands. "I brought one pets, dear," said she. "I think love flowers." The little old lady come tea. This charming. She took bonnet, cap fulfilled Ida's expectations, although nothing smarter soft mass tulle, tied white satin strings. But face looked it! Mrs. Overtheway's features almost perfect. The beauty eyes rather enhanced blue shadows Time painted round them, good eyes remind one clear well, bottom might see truth. When young must exquisitely beautiful, Ida thought. She lovely still. In due time Nurse brought tea, Ida could hardly believe fancies realized last; indeed realized--for bread treacle diminished dignity entertainment; Nurse would soon thought carrying Great Mogul cushions, putting Mrs. Overtheway chair corner. But limit even space time one enjoy tea buttered toast. The tray carried off, hyacinth put place, Ida curled easy chair one side fire, Mrs. Overtheway opposite. "You see I way still," laughed little old lady. "Now, tell primroses." So Ida told everything, apologized awkward speeches housekeeper. "I know name yet," said she. "Call Mrs. Overtheway still, dear, please," said little old lady. "I like it." So Ida wiser score. "I sorry hear made ill account," said Mrs. Overtheway. "I many times ask you, to-night I asked leave come tea. I wish I could something amuse you, poor little invalid. I know must feel dull." Ida's cheeks flushed. "If would tell story," said, "I like hearing Nurse's stories. At least one, I like it. It exactly story either, happened last place. But I rather tired it. There Master Henry--I like much, always mischief; Miss Adelaide, whose hair curled naturally--at least damp brush--I like her; I much them; Nurse generally goes quarrel cook, I never could tell quarrelled about, Nurse said cook full malice deceitfulness, left. I rather tired it." "What sort story shall I tell you?" asked Mrs. Overtheway. "A true one, I think," said Ida. "Something happened yourself, please. You must remember great many things, old." And Ida said simple good-faith, believing compliment. "It quite true," said Mrs. Overtheway, "that one remembers many things end long life, often things happened long ago, sometimes slight wonderful forgotten. I remember, instance, I age, incident occurred gave intense dislike special shade brown satin. I hated then, end half century, I hate still. The thing mere folly; people concerned dead many years, yet present time I find considerable difficulty seeing merits person dress satin peculiar hue. "What it?" asked Ida. "It amber satin, snuff-coloured satin; one shades brown known name feuille-morte, dead-leaf colour. It pretty itself, yet I dislike it." "How funny," said Ida, wriggling arm-chair satisfaction. "Do tell it." "But funny least, unfortunately," said Mrs. Overtheway, laughing. "It really story, either. It even like Nurse's experiences. It strong remembrance childhood, worth repeating, could hardly amuse you." "Indeed, indeed, would," said Ida. "I like sound it. Satin different cooks." Mrs. Overtheway laughed. "Still, I wish I could think something entertaining," said she. "Please tell that," said Ida, earnestly; "I would rather hear something anything else." There resisting loving argument. Ida felt gained point, curled listening attitude accordingly. The hyacinth stood solemn sweetness listening also; Mrs. Overtheway, putting little feet upon fender warm, began story ---- MRS. MOSS. "It move grief, see The trace human step departed, Because garden deserted, The blither place me! "Friends, blame not! narrow ken Hath childhood 'twixt sun sward: We draw moral afterward-- We feel gladness then." E. BARRETT BROWNING. "I remember," said Mrs. Overtheway, "old I am, I remember distinctly many unrecognized vexations, longings, disappointments childhood. By unrecognized, I mean vexations, longings, disappointments could understood nurses, confided even mothers, which, even cradles, become subject law humanity gives every heart secret bitterness endured alone. These sometimes outlive weightier memories, produce life-long impressions disproportionate value; oftener, perhaps, washed away advancing tide time--the vexations, longings, disappointments next period lives. These apt forgotten soon benefit children, forgetting make childhood bright look back upon, foster happy fancy one division mortal life greedy desire, unfulfilled purpose, envy, sorrow, weariness satiety, part, every man believes least happy child.

Then, again, I seem peep rusty iron gates house itself--an old red house, large windows, one could see white shutters always closed.

This curiosity, fancies, roused ancient dress, whose wearer passed away, awakened equally empty houses someone must lived, though place knows more. It manor. How often I peeped gates, catching sight garden walks, wondering whither led, walked them; seeing shutters behind one window partly open, longing look in. "To-day I walks peeped window. This happiness. "Through window I seen large hall marble floor broad stone stairs winding upwards unknown regions. By walks I arrived locked door kitchen garden, small wood wilderness endless delights (including broken swing), dilapidated summer-house. I wandered spongy lawn, cut long green promenade high clipt yew-hedges, walking which, olden times, ladies grew erect stately, plants among brushwood stretch air light. "Finally, I brought away relics seemed honesty would allow. I found half rusty pair scissors summer-house. Perhaps fair lady former days lost here, swept distractedly long walks seeking them. Perhaps present, given luck-penny them, lest cut love. Sarah said housekeeper might dropped there; Sarah person sentiment.

I happy comfortable except one single vexation, this: "I slept little bed nursery, large room used workroom. A great deal sewing done grandmother's house, sewing-maid least one servants sat every evening. A red silk screen put bed shield candlelight, I supposed asleep came upstairs. But I never remember otherwise wide awake, nervously awake, wearily awake. This vexation. I strong child, excitable brain; torture hear maids gossiping side dim red light screen I cannot well describe, I distinctly remember. I tossed till clothes got hot, threw till I got cold, stopped ears, pulled sheet face, tried listen, listened spite all. They told long stories, made many jokes I could understand; sometimes I heard names I knew, fancied I learnt wonderful secret. Sometimes, contrary, I made noises intimate I awake, one would rearrange glaring screen, advise go sleep; talked whispers, distracting still. "One evening--some months ramble round manor--the maids went tea, I lay peaceful silence watching shadows crept noiselessly room fire blazed, wishing Sarah colleagues nothing less month uninterrupted tea-parties. I almost asleep Aunt Harriet came room. She brought candle, put screen (the red screen again!), went work-table. She rustling work things many minutes grandmother followed her, shut door air seemed promise long stay. She also gave shove screen, following conversation began: "'I Lady Sutfield's to-day, Harriet.' "'Indeed, madam.' But aunt respectfully continued work, I could hear scraping scissors along table. "'I heard news there. The manor let.' "I almost jumped bed, Aunt Harriet's scissors paused. "'Let, madam! To whom!' "'To Mrs. Moss. You must heard speak her. I knew years ago, young women. Anastatia Eden, then.' "I could hear aunt move fire, sit down. "'The beautiful Miss Eden? Whom marry last? Was love-affair knew about?' "'Her love-affairs endless. But mean Mr. Sandford. She treated ill--very ill.' "There pause, fire crackled silence; then, infinite satisfaction curiosity, Aunt Harriet said: "'I forgotten story, madam. He poor, not?' "'He quite enough marry on,' grandmother answered, energetically; 'but great match. It old story, dear. The world! The world! The world! I remember sitting Anastatia ball, side evening. We sipped hot posset, talked partners. Ah, dear!' grandmother heaved sigh; partly, perhaps, follies youth, partly, perhaps, youth gone, could come back more. "'Anastatia talked him,' continued. 'I remember asking "her man" pretty fellow, sweet blue eyes greatest simplicity I ever knew child. It true enough; great deal that--a great deal ever understood. Poor Anastatia!

"'Then encourage him?' inquired Aunt Harriet; also moralized, indignation less philosophy. "'I believe loved spite herself; last, offered, turned prudent refused him.' "'Poor man! Did ever marry?' "'Yes, happily--a charming woman. But strange part story is, came quite unexpectedly large property family.' "'Did he? Then would good match admirers?' "'Better. It fine estate. Poor Anastatia!' "'Serve right,' said aunt, shortly. "'She beautiful,' grandmother gently recommenced. She said this, precisely excuse, something sort tone. 'Very beautiful! How stately look night, sure!

"My aunt sniffed, partly depressing consciousness one degenerate generation, limited experience matter county balls; partly also express conviction principle beauty. She said: "'Then Miss Eden married, madam?' "'Yes, rather late, Mr. Moss; wealthy Indian merchant, I believe. She lost children, I know, one another, died. Poor Anastatia! It seems like yesterday. And think coming here!' "My grandmother sighed again, I held breath, hoping particulars lovely heroine romance. But I disappointed. My uncle's voice moment called loudly below, Aunt Harriet hurried conscious meritoriousness her, becoming lady married right man, took great care him. "'Supper, madam. I think,' said, left room. "My grandmother sat still fire, sighing gently then, I lay making mind brave tell I awake. In first place (although I intentionally eavesdropping, awake certainly fault), I felt rather uneasy overheard I knew intended hearing. Besides this, I wanted hear stories lovely Mrs. Moss, ask soon would come manor. After seconds grandmother rose toddled across room. I made effort, spoke breath: "'Granny!' "But grandmother rather deaf. Moreover, voice may drowned heavy sigh closed nursery door. "The room empty again; glare red screen tenderly subdued firelight; I go sleep.

The favoured individual whose daily walk might yew-hedges elastic lawn; eat, drink, sleep commonplace hours present time behind mystical white shutters! But individual added felicitous dispensation fortune personal attributes unparalleled beauty pea-green satin; worn hoops, high heels, powder; countless lovers, white brocade pink rosebuds--well might I sit, brain whirling anticipation, I thought: 'She coming here: I shall see her!' For though, course, I knew lived (so speak) pre-historic times grandmother young, Mrs. Moss must old woman; yet, strange may seem, dear, I assure I never realized fact. I thought I heard her--young beautiful--and modelled hopes accordingly. "Most people's day-dreams take, sooner later, selfish turn. I seemed identify beautiful Anastatia. I thought ball one looks back past. I fancied moving _minuet de la cour_, whose stately paces scarcely made silken rosebuds rustle. I rejected _en masse_ countless suitors fabulous wealth nobility; came Mr. Sandford, I could feel Miss Eden more. My grandmother said loved him, encouraged him, gave money. It mystery! In place, I thought, I would danced every dance him! I would knitted winter, gathered flowers summer hedges. To one kind, one loves? To love, take pleasure giving pain--to balance true heart clear blue eyes money, prefer money--was time comprehensible me. I pondered, (so speak) spread subject mind, sat judgment upon it. "Money--that is, golden guineas (my grandmother given one birthday), crowns, shillings, sixpences, pennies, halfpennies, farthings; come consider many things guinea judiciously expended toy-shop procure, see money great thing, especially full control it, obliged spend anything useful.

Alas! Sandy Tom home; I could imagine gentle rub head would assented. Meanwhile, I made mind firmly one point. My grandmother wrong. Miss Anastatia Eden loved Mr. Sandford. "Smash! The fire, gradually becoming hollow, fell moment, I started find chilly cramped, lay down. Then thoughts took another turn. I wondered I grow beautiful, like Mrs. Moss. It serious question. I often looked glass, I general idea I looked much like little girls age. I began gravely examine detail, beginning top head. My hair light, cropped level lobes ears; this, however, would amend time; I long intended hair raven blackness, touch ground least; 'but till I grown up,' thought I. Then eyes: large; fact, undue proportions assumed I looked ill tired formed family joke. If size one requires eyes, mine would certainly pass muster. Moreover, long curly lashes. I fingered slowly, thought Sandy's whiskers. At point I nearly fell asleep, roused examine nose. My grandmother said Mrs. Moss's nose delicately curved. Now, certainly true curve may either concave convex; I heard bridge nose, knew well enough way curve go; I shrewd suspicion short nose mine, much round tip, could said curved all, curve went wrong way; time I could feel sure. For I must tell lie comfortable bed, hour long beyond time one ought naturally asleep, stroke one's nose, proceeding favourable forming clear judgment important point one's personal appearance. The shadows still well silent, fire ceased flicker, delicious quietude pervaded room, I stroked nose dozed, dozed stroked nose, lost sense shape, fancied huge lump growing fingers. The extreme unpleasantness idea prevented falling asleep; I roused sat again. "'It use feeling,' I thought, 'I look glass.' "There one mirror room. It hung mantelpiece. It old, deeply framed dark wood, hung slope forwards room. "In front fire stood old-fashioned, cushioned arm-chair, high back, many-frilled chintz cover. A footstool lay near it. It grandmother sitting. I jumped bed, put footstool chair I might get level glass, climbed it. Thanks slope mirror, I could see reflection well dim firelight would permit. "'What silly child!' say, Ida. Very silly, indeed, dear. And one remembers one's follies! At end half century, I recall reflection old nursery mirror clearly I remember I looked glass I put bonnet evening come tea you: weird, startled glance eyes, which, prominent stage weariness, gazed shadows looking glass, tumbled tufts hair, ghostly effect white night-dress. As nose, I could absolutely see nothing shape; firelight caught round tip, shone like little white toadstool gloom, all. "'One cannot see shape, full face,' I thought. 'If I another looking-glass.' "But another. I knew it, yet involuntarily looked round room. Suddenly I exclaimed aloud, 'Mr. Joseph do!' "Who Mr. Joseph?--you ask. My dear Ida, I really know. I least idea. I heard called Mr. Joseph, I fancy connection family. All I knew portrait, _silhouette_, elegantly glazed framed black wood, hung nursery wall. I ignorant surname history. I never examined features. But I knew happily stout, since ample coat waistcoat, cut black paper, converted glass covered excellent mirror dolls. "Worthy Mr. Joseph! Here coming useful again. How much owe forefathers! I soon unhooked him, climbing back chair, commenced examination profile process double reflection. But vain! Whether owing dusty state mirror, dim light, unobliging shapeliness Mr. Joseph's person, I cannot say, but, turn twist I would, I could get view profile sufficiently clear complete form correct judgment upon. I held Mr. Joseph, high, low; I stooped, I stood tiptoe, I moved forward, I leant backward. It latest manoeuvre aggravated natural topheaviness chair, endangered balance. The fore-legs rose, spasmodic struggle made wrong direction, I, arm-chair, Mr. Joseph fell backwards together. "Two us light enough, happily escaped unhurt. It arm-chair fell appalling crash, whether worse no, I could tell lay. As soon I little recovered shock, therefore, I struggled raise it, whilst Mr. Joseph lay helplessly upon ground, waistcoat turned ceiling. "It thus aunt found us. "If Mr. Joseph I fallen together, one need wiser; lumbering arm-chair come bump startled sober trio supper dining-room below. "'What _is_ matter?' said Aunt Harriet. "I speechless. "'What doing?' "I could speak; accumulating misfortune gradually overpowering me, I began cry. "'Get bed,' said Aunt Harriet. "I willingly obeyed, Aunt Harriet seated foot. "'Now, think speak, Mary,' said quietly, 'and tell truth. What doing?' "One large tear rolled nose tip I feebly began-- "'I got chair--' "'Well?' said Aunt Harriet. "'--to look glass.' "'What for?' said Aunt Harriet. "Tears flowed unrestrainedly face I howled self-abasement-- "'To look shape nose.' "At point Aunt Harriet rose, and, turning back rather abruptly, crossed room, picked Mr. Joseph. (I since reason believe difficulty concealing fit laughter.) "'What picture for?' inquired, still back me. "'I could see,' I sobbed, 'and I got Mr. Joseph help me.' "My aunt made reply, and, still carefully concealing face, restored Mr. Joseph brass nail great deliberation. "There nothing like full confession. I broke silence. "'Aunt Harriet, I awake Granny here, heard said.' "'You silly, naughty child,' aunt severely returned. 'Why go sleep sent bed?' "'I cannot,' I sobbed, 'with talking candles.' "'You got screen,' said Aunt Harriet; I cannot tell why, somehow I lacked courage say red screen chief instrument torture! "'Well, go sleep now,' concluded, 'and thankful hurt. You might killed yourself.' "Encouraged gracious manner tucked up, I took short cut information I failed attain Mr. Joseph. "'Aunt Harriet,' I said, 'do think I shall ever beautiful Mrs. Moss?' "'I ashamed you,' said Aunt Harriet. "I climbed treacherous arm-chair. I eschewed mirror. I left Mr. Joseph peace upon wall. I took trouble future prospects nose. But night day I thought Mrs. Moss. I found old cushion, sat it, gazing faded tints rosebuds, till I imagined stiff brocade beauty freshness. I took vigorous drawing fit; fill little book innumerable sketches Mrs. Moss. My uncle lent paint-box, not; fancy portraits I made satisfactory even myself, failed spite cheeks blushing vermilion, spite eyes large brilliant lamp-black could make them, spite accurately curved noses pencil could produce. The amount gamboge Prussian blue I wasted vain efforts produce satisfactory pea-green, leaves day astonished admirer uncle's patience. At time I wished walk along road led dear manor, iron gates painted, garden made tidy, shutters opened; but, all, chief object desires accompany grandmother aunt first visit Mrs. Moss. "Once I petitioned Aunt Harriet subject. Her answer was-- "'My dear, would nothing amuse you; Mrs. Moss old woman.' "'Granny said beautiful,' I suggested. "'So was, dear, grandmother young.' "These similar remarks I heard heeded not. They add one wrinkle ideal Mrs. Moss: way whatever lessened desire seeing her. I never seen grandmother young, ever seemed matter tradition; hand, Mrs. Moss presented imagination bloom youth beauty, and, say would, bloom youth beauty I expected see still. "One afternoon, week arrival Mrs. Moss, I busy garden, I working hour more, I heard carriage wheels drive stop door. Could Mrs. Moss? I stole gently round position I could see without seen, discovered carriage caller, uncle's. Then Granny Aunt Harriet going out. I rushed coachman, asked going. He seemed way overpowered reply--'To manor, Miss.' "That Mrs. Moss, I left behind! I stood speechless bitter disappointment, grandmother rustled best silk dress, followed Aunt Harriet uncle, who, saw me, exclaimed: "'Why, little Mary! Why take her? I bound wants go.' "'I do, indeed!' I exclaimed, Cinderella-like tones. "'But Mrs. Moss old lady,' said Aunt Harriet, whose ideas upon children purely theoretical, could imagine interests apart children, toys definite amusements--'What could child herself?' "'Do!' said uncle, took rough cheery view life, 'why, look her, sure. And Mrs. M. old lady, Indian cabinets screens, japanned tables, knick-knacks, lap-dogs. Keep eyes open, Miss Mary. I never seen good lady belongings, I stake best hat japan ware lap-dog. Now, soon dressed?' "Later life selfish element mixes largely admirations. A years thence, first interview object many fancies, I thought much appearance occasion, I see. I taken pains toilette. At time, desire see Mrs. Moss absorbing admit purely personal considerations. I dashed nursery, scrubbed hands face raw red complexion, brushed hair three strokes, secured things one sweep. I hastily pocketed pincushion red cloth, worked yellow silk spots, likeness strawberry. It pet treasure mine, I intended offering Mrs. Moss. I tied hood top stairs, fastened tippet hall, reached family coach three bounds common young animals. "'Halloa!' said uncle, face carriage door. 'You thanked yet.' "I flung arms round starched neck-cloth. "'You darling!' I exclaimed, emphatic squeeze. "'You another,' replied, returning embrace upon hood. "With mutual understanding parted, I thought Mrs. Moss certain fulfil ideal, I wished nearly like Uncle James circumstances case would permit. I watched yellow waistcoat waving hands till could seen longer, I settled primly upon back seat, ventured upon shy conciliating promise 'very good.' "'You quite welcome come, child,' said Aunt Harriet; 'but I said, neither children playthings you.' "Children playthings! What I want either? I put arm loop window watched fields came vanished, vacant eyes, thought Mrs. Moss. A dozen times I gone whole scene mind drove iron gates. I fancied bare, spacious hall, I peeped; I seemed hear light laugh, see beautiful face Mrs. Moss look banisters; hear rustle, scraping stiff brocade, pink rosebuds shimmered, green satin shoes peeped out, tap, tap, tap, high pink heels resounded shallow stairs. "I dreamed day-dream many times carriage stopped shake, Aunt Harriet roused me, asking I asleep. In another minute hall, I met first disappointment. "To begin with, I seen hall unfurnished, imagined otherwise. I pictured Mrs. Moss beauty rose brocade, sole ornament cold emptiness. Then (though I knew grandmother aunt must present) I really fancied chief character interview Mrs. Moss. I thought rushing stairs meet her, laying pincushion green satin feet. And last I really hall, I known again. It carpeted end end. Fragrant orange-trees stood tubs, large hunting-pictures hung upon walls, stood cases stuffed birds, presided footman livery, looked like stuffed specimen human race unusually bright plumage. "No face peeped banisters, went upstairs, footman went first (as seemed due him), grandmother, followed aunt, lastly I, humblest insignificance, behind them. My feet sank soft stair-carpets, I vacantly admired elegant luxury around me, odd sensation heartache. Everything beautiful, I wanted nothing beautiful Mrs. Moss. "Already vision began fade. That full-fed footman troubled fancies. His scarlet plush killed tender tints rosebuds thoughts, streaky powder upon hair seemed mockery _toupêe_ I hoped see, whose whiteness enhance lustre rare black eyes. He opened drawing-room door announced grandmother aunt. I followed, (so far one may said face anything one stands behind skirts two intervening elders) I face face Mrs. Moss. "That is, I face face tall, dark, old woman, stooping shoulders, hooked nose, black eyes smouldered sunken sockets, distinct growth beard upon chin. Mr. Moss dead many years, widow laid aside weeds. She wore dress _feuille-morte_ satin, black lace shawl. She rather elaborate cap, tendency get one side, perhaps would fit comfortably brown front bunchy curls fastened place band broad black velvet. "And Mrs. Moss! This end fancies! There nothing astonishing disappointment; marvel I indulged foolish fancy long. I told Mrs. Moss nearly old grandmother. As was, looked older. Why--I could tell then, though I know now. "My grandmother, though never beauty, sweet smile own, certain occasional kindling eyes, outward signs character full sentiment intelligence; outlasted youth. She always called 'pleasing,' pleasing still. But Mrs. Moss strength, sentiment, intellect filled place beauty gone. Features powerful without character, eyes glowed without expression, formed wreck little recall loveliness bewildered Mr. Sandford--and me. "There much tell, Ida. This disappointment. This dislike certain shade _feuille-morte_ satin. It disappointed rose brocade I never see. You shall hear I got visit, however. This meeting, (like many meetings) proved reverse hoped. "Through angle Aunt Harriet's pelisse, I watched meeting grandmother Mrs. Moss. They kissed drew back looked other, still holding hands. I wondered grandmother felt I felt. I could tell. With one smiles, bent forward, and, kissing Mrs. Moss again, said: "'God bless you, Anastatia.' "'God bless you, Elizabeth.' "It first time Mrs. Moss spoken, voice rather gruff. Then ladies sat down, grandmother drew pocket-handkerchief wiped eyes. Mrs. Moss began (as I thought) look hers, and, finding it, called, "'Metcalfe!' faded little woman, forefinger faded-looking book, came behind window-curtains, and, rummaging Mrs. Moss's chair practised hand, produced large silver snuff-box, Mrs. Moss took pinch, offered Granny, shook head. Mrs. Moss took another larger pinch. It evident made voice gruff. "Aunt Harriet introduced 'My daughter Harriet,' made stiff curtsey Mrs. Moss smiled, nodded, bade 'sit down, dear.' Throughout whole interview seemed looked upon ladies child, played part well, sitting prim silent chair, I could hardly help humming I looked her: 'Hold head, Turn toes, Speak spoken to, Mend clothes.' I introduced, too, 'a grandchild,' made curtsey shadow Aunt Harriet's, received nod, shadow bestowed upon her, got way soon I could, behind aunt's chair, where, coming unexpectedly upon three fat pug-dogs mat, I sat among felt quite home. "The sight pugs brought Uncle James mind, I looked round room, seemed must conjuror least, true everything said. A large Indian screen hid door; japanned boxes stood little table correspond front it, two cabinets shallow drawers decorated handles, great deal glass, odd teacups, green dragons, Indian gods, Dresden shepherdesses visible upon shelves. The room filled knick-knacks, pug-dogs, less three them! They fat, little beauty except round heads black wrinkled snouts, I kissed again. "'Do mind Mrs. Moss's old, dressing hideous brown dress?' I asked whisper ear one round heads. 'Think rosebuds brocade, pea-green satin, high-heeled shoes. Ah!' I added, 'you pug, pugs think.' Nevertheless, I pulled pincushion, showed dog turn, sight forcibly reminded vain hopes, I could help crying. A hot tear fell upon nose oldest fattest pug, offended moved away another mat distance, others fell fast asleep, I took refuge thoughts. "The question arose Mrs. Moss pincushion all? I expected young beautiful, proved old ugly, true; reason old ugly people cushions keep pins in. It struggle part dear strawberry pincushion circumstances, I fairly resolved so, rustle leave-taking began, I come corner. "'Bid Mrs. Moss good-day, Mary,' said grandmother; added, 'the child wild come see you, Anastatia.' "Mrs. Moss held hand good-naturedly. 'So wanted see me, dear?' said she. "I took hand pocket, I holding pincushion, put Mrs. Moss's palm. "'I brought madam,' I said. 'It real strawberry; emery; I made myself.' "And fact sacrificed something Mrs. Moss made almost fond her. Moreover, expression eyes moment gave beauty. She looked grandmother laid hand head. "'I lost mine, Elizabeth.' "I thought speaking pincushions, generous mood, said hastily, "When worn out, madam, I make another.' "But speaking children. Poor Mrs. Moss! She took another huge pinch snuff, called, 'Metcalfe.' "The faded little woman appeared more. "'I must give keepsake return, dear,' said Mrs. Moss. 'The china pug, Metcalfe!' "Metcalfe (whose face always wore smile looked disappear, who, indeed, matter, always looked disappear herself) opened one cabinets, brought little toy pug china, delicately coloured, looking like one friends mat. I fell love once, certainly handsome exchange strawberry pincushion. "'You send child see then, Elizabeth?' said Mrs. Moss retired. "In end Mrs. Moss I became great friends. I put aside dream among 'vain fancies' life, took kindly manor new aspect. Even stuffed footman became familiar, learnt welcome smile. The real Mrs. Moss agreeable person I have, I fear, represented her. She failed grasp solid happiness life, chosen cowardice inferior mind; borne disappointment dignity, submitted heavy sorrows patience; greater nature could done more. She soul good humour, love small chat, contrasted oddly fierce appearance, fund entertainment me, I fed imagination stored memory anecdotes good old times many quiet evenings spent together. I learnt love heartily, I confess, bought new gown gave _feuille-morte_ satin Mrs. Metcalfe. "Mrs. Metcalfe 'humble companion' Mrs. Moss. She reality single, exacted married title point respect. At beginning acquaintance I called 'Miss Metcalfe,' occasioned check friendship ever received. Now I would, greatest pleasure, addressed 'My Lord Archbishop,' style entitled, matter profound indifference me. But question serious one her, serious made it, till I almost despaired ever coming understanding subject. "On every point unassuming almost non-entity. She weak-minded verge mental palsy. She benevolent deed, wandering conversation, one I met since. That is, ordinary life. In greenhouse garden (with head-gardener alone real acquaintance) accurate profound knowledge would put shame many professed garden botanists I met since. From I learnt little I know science horticulture, I spent many happy hours fine botanical works manor library, alone ever opened. "And I became reconciled things were, though day I connect shade _feuille-morte_ satin disappointment forgotten." * * * * * "It dull story, not, Ida?" said little old lady, pausing here. She told precisely words, sum substance it. Ida nodded. Not thought story dull, far heard it, whilst awake; fallen asleep, nodded. Mrs. Overtheway looked back fire, which, indeed, talking time past. "A child's story?" thought. "A tale blind, wilful folly childhood? Ah, soul! Alas, grown-up friends! Does moral belong childhood alone? Have manhood womanhood passionate, foolish longings, blind obvious truth, vanity lessen disappointment? Do still toil rosebuds, find _feuilles-mortes_?" No voice answered Mrs. Overtheway's fanciful questions. The hyacinth nodded fragrantly stalk, Ida nodded chair. She fast asleep--happily asleep--with smile upon face. The shadows nodded gently walls, like shadow little old lady stole quietly away. When Ida awoke, found lying partly arm-chair, partly arms Nurse, lifting up. A candle flared upon table, fire stood empty chair, heavy scent filled room sweet remembrance past happiness. The little old lady vanished, and, hyacinth, Ida would almost doubted whether visit dream. "Has Mrs. Overtheway long gone, Nursey?" asked, keeping eyes upon flowerpot. "Ever long!" said Nurse, "and snoring away, old lady's downstairs, telling comfortably asleep, coming to-morrow evening, good." It precisely twelve minutes since Mrs. Overtheway left house, Nurse slightly exaggerative turn mind, people speak exactly subject time, especially opportunity triumphing someone asleep bed-time. The condition Ida's good also work Nurse's instructive fancy, Ida caught eagerly welcome news another visit. "Then angry falling asleep, Nursey? I comfortable, nice voice, I could help it; I think I left pugs. I wish I pug wrinkled black snout, you, Nursey?" "I sure I not, Miss Ida. My father kept sorts pigs, used one black snout black spots, ugly ugly could be; I never could fancy bacon would fit eat. You must dreaming, I sure; old lady would never tell rubbish, I know." "It pugs, pigs, Nursey; dogs, know," said Ida, laughing. "How funny are! And indeed tell me, I could dreamt it; I never dreamt anything nice life." "And never will, likely," said Nurse, skilful concluding subject want discuss, apt rapid twist line argument, Ida would find somewhat bewildering. "But, dear Miss Ida," continued, "do leave clutching chair-arm, I lifting up; eyes drop head, go staring like that." Ida relaxed nervous grasp, impelled energy subject pugs, let eyebrows, submitted undressed. The least pleasant part ceremony may comprised word curl-papers. Ida's hair dark, soft, smooth, little girls wore ringlets, little girl must wear ringlets too. To end hair every night put curl-papers, much tight twisting sharp jerking, Ida slept upon irregular layer small paper parcels, made pillows mockery. With this, however, damp day, good romp, would sometimes undo night's work, great disgust Nurse. In last place, young lady's hair curled damp brush, Ida well knew, Nurse made much grievance, use curl-papers, place left Ida's grievance sleep upon them. She submitted night therefore, nights, patience, sat swinging feet accommodating head sharp tugs, always seemed come unexpected quarters. Perhaps, however, mind may running little upon grievances, made say: "You know, Nursey, always telling I ought thankful things, things, and--" "I wish would talk sense, give way head I pull, Miss Ida," retorted Nurse, "having things, things; I know mean." "Well, know, Nursey, day I said I like bread-and-treacle treacled long before, soaked in, said I ought thankful I bread-and-treacle all, I wooden leg, eat anything I could get, like old sailor man corner; well, know, I thought something I _am_ thankful for, I red screen bed." "I really think, Miss Ida," said Nurse, "that go mind day, outlandish fancies. And get them, I cannot think. I sure _I_ never put things head." Ida laughed again. "Never mind, Nursey, belongs pug story. Am I done now? And tucked up, please, would mind remembering put flower I see I wake?" Nurse asked, Ida watched hyacinth till fell asleep; slept well. In morning took old post window. The little old lady never seemed long making appearance, bells slow begin. Chim! chime! chim! chime! There last, Mrs. Overtheway. She looked up, waved bunch snowdrops, went bells. Ida kissed hand, waved again, long little old lady sight. "There kiss you, dear Mrs. Overtheway," cried, "and kisses flowers, house, everything belonging you, bells church, everybody morning, and--" But, point universal benevolence, Nurse carried breakfast. The little old lady came tea before. She looked well ever, Nurse equally generous matter tea toast. Mrs. Overtheway told Ida missed story Mrs. Moss, Ida apologized, earnest distress, uncivil conduct falling asleep. "There I snoring away, telling delightful story!" exclaimed, penitently. "Not snoring exactly, dear," smiled little old lady, "but looked happy." "I thought Nursey said so," said Ida. "Well, I glad. It would rude. And know I know was, I _am_ fond stories; I like nothing well." "Well, shall I try again?" said Mrs. Overtheway. "Perhaps I may find amusing one, put sleep, harm. Indeed, I think doctor say I good company you." "You good! That _I_ tell him," said Ida, fervently, "and please let again, remember anything. I like true stories." "Talking snoring," said Mrs. Overtheway, "reminds something happened youth, true, though, know, ghost story." Ida danced chair. "That I like!" exclaimed. "Nurse ghost story, belonging farm-house, tells housemaid, says cannot tell till I older, I like hear ghost story, horrid." "This ghost story horrid, I think," laughed little old lady, "and let think minutes, forgive prosy way telling it, shall once." There pause. The little old lady sat silent, sat Ida also, eyes intently fixed Mrs. Overtheway's face, occasional smile passing. "It ghost snored," said little old lady, doubtfully. "Delicious!" responded Ida. The two friends settled comfortably, words told following story:-- THE SNORING GHOST. _Clown._ Madman, thou errest: I say darkness Ignorance, thou art puzzled Egyptians fog.... What opinion Pythagoras concerning wild fowl? _Malvolio._ That soul grandam might haply inhabit bird. _Clown._ What thinkest thou opinion? _Malvolio_. I think nobly soul, way approve opinion. _Twelfth Night_, iv. 2. "I remember," said Mrs. Overtheway, "I remember first visit. That is, I remember occasion I sister Fatima did, first time lives, go visiting without mother, grown-up person take care us." "Do remember mother?" asked Ida. "Quite well, dear, I thankful say. The best kindest mothers!" "Was father alive, too?" Ida asked, sigh. The old lady paused, pitying anxious little face opposite, Ida went eagerly: "Please tell _he_ like." "He good deal older mother, married early. He learned man. His tastes accomplishments many various, young-hearted enthusiastic pursuit life. He apt take one subject interest another, time completely absorbed it. And, I must tell you, whatever subject might be, long head full it, house seemed full too. It influenced conversation meals, habits household, names pet animals, even children. I called Mary, fever chivalrous enthusiasm fair luckless Queen Scotland, Fatima received name study Arabic brought eastern mania. My father wished call Shahrazád, renowned sultana 'Arabian Nights' called upon curate arrange baptism, worthy man flatly rebelled. A long discussion ended father's making list eastern names, curate selected Fatima least repugnant sobriety parish registers. So Fatima called, grew pale, moon-faced, dark-eyed, name became well." "Was Fatima went visiting you?" asked Ida. "Yes, dear; visit. The invitation came thirteenth birthday. "One's birthday generally day importance. A notable day whilst one young, less one old, one carried quickly last stages life, seems hardly worth count time near end journey. Even youth, however birthdays important others. I remember looking forward tenth birthday high point dignity advancement; pride occasion I first wrote age figures one. With similar feelings, I longed thirteen. The able write age two figures not, all, would special lustre upon life; I 'in teens' must 'feel different somehow.' So I thought. Moreover, birthday really bring solid advantages. I allowed read certain books grown-up character I read hitherto, sit till nine clock. I wear sandals shoes. My hair henceforth grow long I Fates would permit, skirts frocks take inch direction. 'In four years,' I said Fatima, sat eve birthday, discussing manifold advantages, 'in four years I shall grown up. Miss Ansted introduced seventeen.' The prospect illimitable. "'Do people always grow much birthdays?' asked one little ones. I boasted nursery, I thirteen I 'nearly grown up,' I hardly outlived idea one's birthday one year older previous day, might naturally expect made year's growth night. "This birthday, however, produced striking change. As usual, presents charming; wreath lovely Fatima's deft fingers could make it, general holiday pleasure-making almost much good thing. Otherwise, little mark days year. "Towards evening sitting grass, boys heads sisters' laps, outcry story, one responded; partly, perhaps, exquisite air evening seemed sufficient delight, stillness profound lightly disturbed. We remained time without speaking, idea becoming general among girls boys napping, summer silence broken distant footfalls horse upon high road. "'Trotting!' observed one supposed sleepers. We not, family, given explanations, drew breaths evening air silence. Then someone said: "'We might make story _that_, fancy sorts things. Who it? Where come from, going to?' "'It messenger seat war,' drawled boy lap, without moving. Then, lifting curly head moment, cried, 'To horse! gentlemen, horse! The enemy Carter's Mill midnight!' "There pause; solitary footfalls came nearer evening mists, small brother, quaint turn mind, much given study historical portions Old Testament, sat said, slowly: "'It one Job's messengers. _The Chaldeans made three bands, fell upon camels, carried away, yea, slain servants edge sword; I escaped alone tell thee._' "The others boys laughed, lay again, solemnly risen. "'That foot-messenger,' said boy, contemptuously. "'It say so,' retorted small brother. "'Well, way, camels carried off--so ride upon?' "A squabble imminent. I covered boy's face handkerchief, keep quiet. "'Listen!' I said. 'It post. The mail north stopped highway, saved bags, riding hard London.' "'It is--' "But new suggestion drowned general shout of-- "'It coming lane!' "The footfalls diverged main road, coming sandy lane skirted wall. The boys lifted heads, sat expectant. There pause, familiar gate-click, footfalls broke upon carriage-road, close us. A man livery, upon well-groomed horse--nothing more, rather uncommon sight us. Moreover, man livery strange, horse looked tired. "This event broke sitting, strolling house, maid met us, saying mother wished see Fatima. "We found mother sewing, opened letter beside her. It written one large quarto sheets use, covered crossed, every available corner, vague, scratchy hand. "'I heard old friend mine, Mary,' said mother. 'She come live twelve miles here. There something letter Fatima, may read part aloud, can. The top last page.' "I found place, and, difficulty, deciphered: 'The dear Major delicacy consideration--' "'No, no!' said mother, 'the next sentence.' "'Dear Cecilia sweetness. The dress was--' "My mother took letter, found right place herself, I read: "'If cannot come yourself, least let us renew acquaintance children. I think two girls thirteen? My Lucy, dear child fifteen, feels keenly loss sister, young companions would boon, company _elders_. Pray send them. They come coach, shall met Durnford, Elephant Castle.' "'Is sister dead?' asked Fatima, pityingly, discussed personal interest subject. "'Oh, no! married,' said mother. "It decided go. This decision arrived once, without ups downs. My mother could go herself, doubts old enough, yet, go visiting alone. It believed I made much able say--'But know, I thirteen, now.' "Next day, evening, father busy study, mother sat open window, Fatima feet. The letter acceptance duly sent messenger, yet good deal advice give, doubts express. She one people cannot sit idle fingers, talked knitted. We found easy enough sit idle upon two little footstools, listening dear kind voice, watching two little clouds, fragments larger group, detached themselves, sailing slowly alone across heavens. "'They like us two,' Fatima whispered me; 'perhaps going see clouds.' "'I observed two things apt befall young people go visiting,' said mother, turned row knitting, 'one is, neglect little good habits away, is, make disagreeable come back.' "The clouds drifted on, mother continued knitting, arming us many wise counsels small matters connected great event; Fatima I gratefully gave half minds, whilst half made rosy pictures unparalleled excellence trying circumstances, which, hereafter, prove warnings counsels been, case, unnecessary superfluous. "'Most families people,' said mother, 'have little good habits customs feel bound keep, although among great general duties bind every one. So long young people home, matters often simple enough, go away certain difficulties arise. They go amongst people whose little habits accustomed. Sometimes come uncharitable conclusions upon friends' characters consequence. And, I must say, I never met one could severe young people age apt be. I remember myself, I seen many girls. Home naturally standard, whatever different seems wrong. As life goes on, young critics learn (or learn) distinguish general particular duties; also coming know larger number people, find good persons cut pattern, one's friends' little ways therefore absurd, one happen used them. On hand, going amongst people may tempt critical little habits, also apt make neglect own. Perhaps think cannot much matter, great duties, people seem get quite well without them. But one learns end, character value formed without discipline individual rules, rules use held circumstances. "Charitable others, severe himself," seems maxim grown-up people grown-up things; but, I believe, little daughters, doubts difficulties life begin early, earlier commonly provided against; I think innumerable girls struggle miserably practice duty, radical ignorance principles, earlier learnt, smaller burden regret one heaps together oppress future, sooner one finds peace mind common even amongst young, should-be light-hearted.' "In these, words effect, dear mother prepared us first plunge society. We discussed little good habits maintain, and, amongst others, certain little Sunday customs--for away week. "'We cannot take good habits us, come,' I said. 'What become Sunday readings?' "For mother used read us every Sunday evening, middle book wondrous fascination--'The Pilgrim's Progress.' "'If others, would trust us it,' said Fatima, thoughtfully, 'we might take book us, Mary might read me, would--I like reading.' "My mother consented. There another copy house, though volume favourite, said time learnt take care valuable books. So settled. We talked evening; clouds drifted sight. "'They gone bed big dark cloud side' said Fatima, yawning; went bed also. "My story wanders, Ida; old woman's tale. Old people age become prosy, dear. They love linger little remembrances youth, recall good counsels kind voices long silent. But I must put sleep second time, I describe lists good habits Fatima I drew fine Roman characters, kept good resolutions never kept before.

"'Then Miss Mary marry?' said old gentleman, grim smile. "I shook head sage disdain. 'When I sixteen, I shall Amazon.'

It seemed take hostess second two see us, another second two recall were; came forward kindly, showed us sit, asked mother. Whilst I replying, crossed fire-place, rang bell; I felt slightly surprised seeming wish news old friend. She asked pleasant journey, Fatima hardly pronounced modest yes, begged would allow finish letter, went back spindle-legged table. Whilst scratched looked around us. Three four ladies room, less young, less pretty, less elegantly dressed, less elaborate pieces needlework. There one gentleman, young dark, large brown eyes, seemed employed making paper pellets old letter, chatting low voice young lady good deal red hair. We afterwards found Irishman, familiarly called 'Pat' young ladies, seemed related him. We seen man-servant appeared door. "'Where Miss Lucy, Thompson?' hostess asked, sharply. "'I inquire, madam,' Thompson replied, utmost softness, vanished. "The scratching began again, Irishman went gently chatting, felt like horrid dream. Then Thompson reappeared. "'Miss Lucy out, madam.' "'Did know time young ladies arrive?' "'Miss Lucy knew carriage gone meet them, madam.' "'Very thoughtless! Very thoughtless indeed!' said lady. Thompson paused respectfully, receive full weight remark, vanished noiselessly before. "There awkward pause. Our hostess left scratching, looked cross; Irishman fired one pellets across room, left chatting, red-haired young lady got up, rustled across us. I remember well, Ida, fell deeply love kindness. I remember green white dress. She fair round face, pleasant really pretty, white starlike forehead, almost firm mouth, gentle voice, least, thought, said: "'As Lucy out, may I take young ladies room?' "Our hostess hesitated, murmured something Bedford, lady's maid. The starlike forehead contracted, red-haired young lady said, rather emphatically: "'As Lucy receive friends, I thought I might perhaps supply place.' "'Well, dear Kate, kind,' said hostess, 'I must finish letters.' "'The yellow room?' said young lady, abruptly, swept us without parley. The Irish gentleman opened door us, staring half-puzzled, half-amused look lofty air young lady passed out. He followed us hall, left discharging remaining pellets furniture, whistling 'Kathleen Mavourneen,' clearly bird. "The yellow room large airy one, white painted wainscoting, huge four-post bed yellow curtains, pretty view windows. In middle floor saw box standing dignity, uncorded, ready. Then terrible fact broke upon minds key left behind. My sufferings seconds I found courage confide misfortune new friend considerable. When I tell her, calmness good nature received confession surprising delightful. "'The lock look uncommon one, said, opened door. 'I dare say I may find key fit it.' "'What matter?' said voice outside. It Irish gentleman. She explained. "'Keys?' said Irish gentleman; 'got lots pocket, besides totally unnecessary, I capital hand lock-picking. Let see.' "With slipped in, seeming quite much ease drawing-room, another second squatted upon floor box, seemed quite comfortable arm-chair left. Here poked, fitted, whistled, chatted without pause. "'I locks keys everything I possess' cheerfully remarked; 'and I never lock anything, damage done keys left behind, good thing, see, I always leave everything everywhere.' "'Do make principle it?' asked young lady, coldly. "'I afraid I make practice it.' He opened box, leaning bed-post, roguish twinkle brown eyes, faded, however, silent severity red-haired young lady, gave place look melancholy might melted granite, added: "'I alone, see, it. I believe I neatest creature breathing, I would somebody keep it.' "Neither hardened untidiness lonely lot seemed, however, weigh heavily mind; withdrew whistling, notes heard passages little time. When died away distant part house, red-haired young lady left us also. "I shall give lengthened account unpacking, dear Ida; though enjoyable, less protracted packing-up been. How revelled spacious drawers cupboards, queens, strictly followed one mother's wise counsels--'unpack bottom box once, however short visit may be; saves time end.' We unpack lowest book (an artificial system memory, I long purposing study, I thought find spare moments get here, which, I may well confess, I look visit, learnt day). We divided shelves pegs fairness, final triumph found use elaborate watch-pockets hung pillows. They rich unlimited expenditure quilled ribbon, must given great deal trouble someone many serious occupations life. Fatima I wished watches put them, till happy thought suddenly struck one us, could keep respective papers good habits. "Bedford came whilst midst labours, warmly begged us leave everything her, would put things away us. The red-haired young lady sent her, became mainstay practical comfort us visit. She seemed humanity conventions drawing-room. From got incidental meals hungry, spirits wine Fatima's tooth ached, warnings near late breakfast, little modern fashionable turns hair clothes, familiar anecdotes household others lived. I remember gratitude. "Miss Lucy came home putting away fairly finished, tea schoolroom. She slight, sharp, lively young lady, looking older fifteen us, rather pretty, self-possessed. She scanned us head foot first met, I felt eyes found defects innumerable, seemed less likely, also shortsighted. As governess away visiting sick relative, Miss Lucy honours schoolroom. She cold inattentive first, became patronizing tea, ended gracious. In gracious mood affectionate confidential. She called us 'my dear girls,' put arms round us sat dark, chattered without pause herself, governesses, sister, sister's husband. "'A wedding house,' observed, 'is good fun, particularly take principal part it. I chief bride's-maid, know, dear girls. But I tell whole affair first. You know I never bride's-maid before, I could make mind I like dresses,' etc., etc. And got story Miss Lucy's costume, called dress go downstairs. "'What going put on?' asked, balancing door peering in. "'White muslin!' said pride, new frocks, splendid eyes. "'I many muslins, I tired them,' said; 'I shall wear pink silk to-night. The trimming came London. Perhaps I may wear muslin to-morrow; I Indian one. But shall see dresses to-morrow, dear girls.' "With left us, put new frocks (which _the_ evening dresses visit) depressed spirits. This owing thought pink silk, possibility surfeit white muslin. "During evening learnt another Miss Lucy's peculiarities. Affectionate alone together, sooner among grown-up young ladies downstairs kept much permitted, seemed forget us altogether. Perhaps fit particularly short sight attacked her; seemed look us, away us, side us, anywhere us, quite unconscious existence. The red-haired young lady made fetch us large scrap-book, sat eyes, soft monotonous chit-chat hostess ears, talked worked elder ladies sofa. It seemed long gossip, particular end beginning, tatting, trimmings, military distinction, linens, servants, honourable conduct, sentiment, settlements, expectations, Bath waters, finely blended. From constant mention Cecilia dear major, evident late wedding subject discourse; indeed, matter, remained prime topic conversation stay. "Cecilia dear major Bath, letters read aloud breakfast-table. I remember wondering deep interest ladies seemed take bride's pretty flow words fashions, drives, pump-room, long lists visitors' names; this, too, without connection hearers people places mentioned. When anybody recognize name, however, knew anything, seemed like finding treasure. All ladies bore upon once, dug family history farthest known point, divided subject among them. Miss Lucy followed letters closely, remembered wonderfully, though (as I afterwards found) never seen Bath, knew people mentioned little hearsay facts gathered former letters. "It useful art, dear Ida, one I sadly failed life, able remember related whom, watering-place family went summer last, common friends met there, etc. But, like arts, demands close attention, forbids day-dreaming, takes good deal time. "'_Wasn't_ odd,' said Miss Lucy, one morning breakfast, 'that Cecilia major meet Hicksons!' "'Who Hicksons?' I asked. "'Oh! dear girl, remember, Cecilia's last letter, telling us lady met shop town, buying shawl counterpart own? seems odd turn Bath, nice people! Do remember mamma said must family Colonel Hickson engaged girl one eye, caught small-pox got much marked, broke off?' "'Small-pox one eye would look ugly,' Fatima languidly observed; subject drifted rest. "One afternoon, I remember, chanced left alone hostess drawing-room. No one else happened way talk to, good lady talked us. We clever girls age, I fancy, used talk good deal mother; rate attentive listeners, I think hostess required much us. I think glad anybody heard whole affair beginning end, put feet sofa, started afresh complete history dear Cecilia cradle; gone major, military exploits abroad, genteel connections home, tendency gout family troubled times, sad anxiety dear child, visitors announced. "Our intelligent attention gained favour us; introduced ladies 'daughters dear friend mine, I seen years,' one lady gave sweet glance tight smile murmured: "'So pleasant renew acquaintance children;' ladies gave sweet glances, tight smiles also, echoed: "'So pleasant!' "'Such sensible girls!' said hostess, there; 'like women fifty. So like dear mother! Such treasures little Lucy! You know lost dear sister,' etc., etc. "For ladies drew together, hostess got fresh audience, retired distant arm-chairs, good deal bewildered. "But return first evening. "Miss Lucy retired together, sooner drawing-room door closed behind us, wound arms round waists, became devoted side side whole evening. "'I tell I do, dear girls,' said reached room; 'I come sleep (there lots room three), I go Cecilia's affair, finish to-night go to-morrow morning get up. I always wake early, I call you. I come back I ready bed.' "And vanished. "We bed returned. Her hair undergoing wonderful process, stowed away large elaborate night-cap. "'Bedford slow,' said she; 'and then, know, I got bed, let tidy room, fairly gone, I got, I am. We shall comfortable possible; I middle, I side me, dear girls;' sprang. "'Did notice this?' asked, holding hand, pointing edging sleeve night-dress; 'it new pattern; know it? Oh! dears, yards yards tatting Cecilia trousseau!' "Fatima I rich tatting edges, rejoiced conversation took another turn. "'About proposal,' rambled on; 'do know I really know whereabouts Henry (that major, brother-in-law,' added, one little attacks dignity subject) 'proposed said. I asked Cecy, would tell me. She cross, often; I glad married. I think sisters ought marry fast can; never get well house together, know.' "I fairly gasped idea, Fatima said bluntly: "'There lots us, get on.' "'Ah!' said Miss Lucy, tones wisdom; 'wait till little older, see. Cecy school two sisters hated like poison, obliged dress alike, younger wore things much faster one, obliged wear till sister's done. She used wish sister would marry, Cecy said, best fun is, love man. He curate church go to.' "'Which love with?' I asked. "'Oh, neither I know of,' said Miss Lucy, composedly. 'They know him, know; sit close pulpit, struggles shall get corner pew nearest. Cecy I like that; still I glad married. Now stupid tell me? I never told anybody, know. And wonder gentlemen say, say it? He could propose sitting, I think standing would awkward. I suppose knelt. Aunt Maria approve gentlemen kneeling; says idolatry. I think must look silly. Cecy would even tell said. She said spoke mamma, mamma said conduct highly honourable; I think stupid. Do know, dears, I cousin really married Gretna Green? She married officer. He splendidly handsome; people said things him, parents objected. So eloped, went Wales, lovely place! Was romantic? They quarrelled afterwards though; lives abroad now. People ought careful. I shall careful myself; I mean refuse first offers I get.' "And Miss Lucy rambled on, perfectly unconscious melancholy yet ludicrous way degraded serious subjects, old enough understand, wise enough reverence. We young see fully, frivolity jarred upon us, though amused us, excited curiosity. She worse many girls, plenty inquisitiveness sharp sense, much refinement feeling; whose accomplishments learnt 'first masters,' whose principles left picked gossip, servants, second-rate books; digested ignorant, inquisitive, undisciplined minds. "I try recall it, dear Ida. I remember continuous stream unedifying gossip, varied small boastings family. We many connections, favourite phrase Miss Lucy's, seemed mean great deal. 'Do like making trees?' asked. I getting sleepy, without much thought replied, 'I love trees beyond anything, I like growing oak trees bottles.' Miss Lucy's, 'My dear girl, I mean family trees, genealogical trees,' patronizing scorn. 'Ours spring drawer big oak cabinet drawing-room,' added. 'We descended King Stephen.' "I believe I first fall asleep night. The last words I remember hearing were: 'We many connections.' "The next day's post brought news Bath general interest household. The plans Cecilia major changed; coming mother's following Monday. "'My dear girls, I _am_ glad!' said Miss Lucy; 'you see them. But move room, I sorry say.' "And next twelve hours Miss Lucy descriptive family glories general, glories sister brother-in-law particular, ever. "Sunday day mixed experiences us; pleasant reverse. Miss Lucy best clothes almost intolerably patronizing, general stiffness seemed pervade everything, ladies' silk dresses included. After breakfast dawdled till time dress church, ladies took five minutes allowed for, seemed likely late. At last moment, Miss Lucy lost Prayer Book, till another five minutes gone search remembered left church Sunday before. This settled stowed away carriages drove off. It short drive; came sight quaint little church sound bells, became evident late. In porch shook dresses, Irishman divided burden Prayer Books gallantly bearing, hostess turned back half-open door say loud encouraging whisper, 'It Confession;' swept little church huge square pew. "My dear Ida, I must tell brought horror late service, point father called 'very particular.' Fatima I therefore felt greatly discomposed late disturbing entrance, though way blame. We also taught kneel prayers, uncomfortable sensation doubt shame-facedness saw one lady another sit bend bonnet lap, hesitated follow customs face majority. But red-haired young lady seemed fated help us difficulties. She sank knees corner pew, green silk falling round her; knelt side, question settled. The little Irishman cast doubtful glance moment, sat down, bending head deeply hat. We went similar process responding, seem fashion hostess friends. The red-haired young lady held customs, however, held her. Our responses less conspicuous, good deal drowned voice old gentleman next pew. Diversity seemed prevail manners congregation. This gentleman stood prayers, balancing huge Prayer Book corner pew, responding loud voice, devout tuneful, keeping exact time parson also, grudge clerk felt due keep advance him. I remember, Ida, came in, saying, 'those things ought _not_ done,' said terrible voice, took glance us gold-rimmed spectacles, I wished massive pulpit-hangings would fall bury confusion. When text sermon given out, hostess rustled up, drew curtains well round pew. Opposite me, however, gap I could see old gentleman. He settled facing pulpit, sat gazing preacher rigid attention seemed say--'Sound doctrine, please; I eye you.' "We returned came. "'Is afternoon service?' I asked Miss Lucy. "'Oh, yes!' reply, 'the servants go afternoon.' "'Do you?' I asked. "'Oh, no!' said Miss Lucy, 'once enough. You go maids, want to, dears,' added, one occasional touches insolence indulged. "Afternoon arrived, I held consultation Fatima do. "When roused, Fatima resolute I. "'Of course go,' said she; 'what use written good rules sticking this? We always go twice home. Let us look Bedford.' "On mission I set forth, I reached top stairs I caught sight red-haired young lady, bonnet shawl, standing open door, Prayer Book hand. I dashed downstairs, entered hall Irishman came another door. In hand Prayer Book also, picked hat, went smiling towards her. But approached young lady, looked much annoyed--not say cross--that I hesitated go forwards. "'Are going church?' said little Irishman, pleased look. "'I know,' said young lady, briefly, 'are you?' "'I was--' began, stopped short, looking puzzled vexed. "'Is else going?' asked, moment's pause. "'No one else ever go,' said, impatiently, moved hall. "The Irishman coloured. "'I habit going twice myself, though may think it,' said, quietly; 'my poor mother always did. But I pretend go good purpose did, would, lie us--' and, without finishing sentence, threw book (not gently) table, and, lifting hat passed her, dashed garden. "I understand little scene, but, soon gone, I ran ask friend going church, would take us. She consented, I went back triumph Fatima. As time lose, dressed quickly enough; I rather surprised, went down, find Irish gentleman, face restored usual good humour, standing friend, holding Prayer Book well own. The young lady speak, but, cheerfully remarking plenty time us, took books also, set forth. "I remember walk well, Ida! The hot, sweet summer afternoon--the dusty plants pathway--the clematis hedges (I put bit Prayer Book, years)--the grasshoppers flies dresses caught long grass, reappeared sat sermon. "The old gentleman pew, glance almost benevolent, as, good time, took places. We (literally) _followed_ example much heartiness responses; and, looked pew prayers (and position could hardly avoid it), must seen even Irishman rejected compromises, knelt together. "There one feature service forgotten. When sermon ended, I lost sight last grasshopper hasty rising, found hymn. It old custom church conclude Evening Prayer. No one seemed use book--it Bishop Ken's evening hymn, everyone knew, and, I think, everyone sang. But feature us Irishman began sing. From startled glance, I think even red-haired young lady known possessed beautiful voice. It clearness without effort, tone, truth, pathos, I often heard. It sounded strangely nasal tones school-children, scraping solitary fiddle. Even neighbour, lustily followed rhythm tune, though without much varying note responded, softened sounds turned look Irishman, sang without noticing it, till, last verse, seemed disturbed discover many eyes him. Happily, self-consciousness come late. The hymn ended. "We knelt Benediction, went back summer fields. "The red-haired young lady talked little. Once said: "'How never heard sing?' "To Irishman replied: "'I understand music, I sing ear; I hate 'company' performances. I sing whenever like.' "'Mary,' said Fatima, room again, 'I believe two marry day.' "'So I,' I answered; 'but say anything Lucy.' "'No, indeed!' said Fatima, warmly. So kept idea sacred Miss Lucy's comments--why, I think either us could told words. 'Pity, pleasant impressions--pity, impressions--pass away soon! * * * * * "The evening altogether satisfactory afternoon been. First, Miss Lucy took us see sister's wedding-presents, still mother's keeping. They splendid, Miss Lucy eloquent. From dawdled room, displayed treasures, running commentary matters taste fashion, lasted till time dress evening, made usual inquiry, 'What shall put to-night, dear girls?' blushed nothing limited toilettes reveal. "In drawing-room, similar subjects conversation awaited us. Our hostess friends seem care much reading, and, work Sunday evening, talked more. The chatter ran chiefly upon Bath fashions, upon ball held somewhere, somebody dressed manner appeared needful protest against; whilst somebody else (a cousin hostess) points perfectly attired, seemed afforded ample consolation lady's defects. "Upon beauty cousin, father's wealth, superabundant opportunities matrimony, Miss Lucy enlarged us, sat corner. Another peculiarities, by-the-by, this. By account, relatives friends sense beautiful. The men generally 'splendidly handsome;' ladies, 'the loveliest creatures.' If 'lovely,' 'stylish;' nothing else, 'charming.' For beyond magic circle, process reversed. If pretty, 'wanted style.' If dress beyond criticism, nose, complexion, hand fault. I met _trait_ cliques, since then. "My dear Ida, I wish encourage young lady hoydenish age thirteen, despising nice dressing pretty looks manners; neglecting pick little hints may glean things older friends. But people questions seem first importance, young impressionable, feel every defect personal appearance crime, believe neither worth, love, happiness (no life, fact, worth living for) connected much less ten thousand year, 'connections.' Through ordeal passed evening, seeing hearing expensive luxuries without seemed impossible feed, dress, sleep, go out--in fact, exist; equally expensive items adornment, without appeared impossible (or rate retain) respect affection friends. "Meanwhile, evening slipped by, Sunday reading accomplished. We found little good habits less easy maintain strange household thought, one seemed likely follow others allowed slip. The red-haired young lady absent half hour, Irishman prowling restlessly round room, performing murderous-looking fidgets paper-knives, returned book hand, settled resolutely read. The Irishman gave comical glance serious-looking volume, then, seating chair behind her, found apparent peace effort sharpen flat ruler knees. The young lady read on. It evident Sunday customs apt disturbed circumstances. "I began feel uncomfortable. Fatima crouched near Lucy, listening history piece lace. I waited little time catch eye, beckoned me. "'We read,' I whispered. "'Dare go?' asked Fatima. "'We ought,' I said. "It required daring may appear. To little people _was_ rather undertaking cross big drawing-room, stealing together soft carpet; attack large, smooth handle, open heavy door, leave room face company. We it, however, confusion much increased Irish gentleman, jumped open door us. We utterly unable thank him, and, stumbling passage, flew room like caged birds set free. "Fatima drew pillows bed, made easy floor. I found book, climbed window-seat. The sun setting, light would last much longer; yet I turned pages slowly, find place, second part, thinking conversation downstairs. Fatima heaved deep sigh among cushions, said: 'I wish rich.' "'I wish home,' I answered. "'When one's home,' Fatima continued, doleful tones, 'one feel it, one sees nobody; one goes among people, _is_ wretched plenty money things. And good saying not,' added, hurriedly, close subject. "'It getting dark,' I said. "'I beg pardon: go on,' sighed Fatima. "I lifted voice, read till I could see longer. It Valley Humiliation Mr. Greatheart led Christiana children. The 'green valley, beautified lilies,' whose meadows air pleasant; 'a man shall free noise hurryings life;' 'in former times men met angels.' "The last streaks crimson fading sky I read concluding lines shepherd-boy's song-- 'Fulness burden is, That go pilgrimage, Here little, hereafter bliss, Is best age age.' "'Here little, hereafter bliss!' "It always easy realize one believes. One needs sometimes get away world around, 'from noise hurryings life,' hear, read, see, something remind one standard drawing-rooms; petty troubles pilgrimage soul; great happy lives lived little; satisfying bliss here, hereafter. "We went downstairs slowly, hand hand. "'I wonder mother doing?' said Fatima. * * * * * "The next day Miss Lucy good-naturedly helped us move belongings smaller room occupy. It another part house, rather enjoyed running fro, especially Miss Lucy gracious communicative extreme. "'This oldest part house,' said, sat bed resting labours, day sultry; 'and breaks odd way. There rooms beyond this. There matched side house, pulled down.' "'Why?' asked. "'Well, story it, family,' said Miss Lucy, mysteriously. 'But ghost story. I tell you, like. But people afraid ghost stories. I not; are, I tell it.' "Of course declared afraid. Sitting together, sunny summer's afternoon, perhaps not. "'It years years ago,' began Miss Lucy; 'you know place belonged another branch family generations. Well, last came old Mr. Bartlett, one daughter, who, course, heiress. Well, fell love man whose name I forget, inferior family, queer character; father would hear it, swore married would disinherit her. She would married man spite this, though; wanted money; so, found old man quite resolute, chance dying soon, murdered him.' "We exclaimed; sudden catastrophe fairly took away breath. Miss Lucy's nerves sensitive, however, rattled on. "'He smothered bed, and, old man, might easily died night way, nothing could proved, got off. Well, married daughter, got property; first evening took possession, passing door old man's room, heard somebody breathing heavily inside, looked in, old father asleep bed.' "'Not really?' said. "'Of course really,' said Miss Lucy, 'but said. That ghost part it. Well, would, never could get rid old man, always asleep; pulled rooms down, last went abroad, wife died, property went cousin, took name Bartlett.' "'How awful!' murmured. But Miss Lucy laughed, told us family anecdotes, ghost story somewhat passed minds, especially little later heard wheels, and, peeping landing window, beheld post-chaise drive up. "'It Cecilia!' screamed Miss Lucy, left us once. "I may well say here, dear Ida, Cecilia major proved altogether different expectations. Cecilia, travelling gear, taking old bonnet, begging cup tea, complaining soft accents butter halfpenny pound dearer Bath home, seemed connection Cecilia trimmings whose dresses bank-notes recklessly dissolved. The major, almost middle-aged man, roughish exterior, plain clothes, pulling moustache letter arrived him, dispelled visions manly beauty military pomp even effectually. Later on, discovered Cecilia really pretty, soft, gentle, good deal lectured mother, critical Miss Lucy's dress appearance young lady ours. The major proved kind sensible. He well-to-do 'expectations,' facts would round glory invisible us. They seemed happy couple; like rest world led suppose. "The new-comers completely absorbed attention evening, till fairly entering older part house way bed, story old man's ghost recurred mind. It relief meet Bedford point, hear cheerful good-night, see turn room two doors ours. Once undressing I said: "'What horrid story Lucy told us.' "To sensible Fatima made answer: 'Do talk it.' "We dismissed subject consent, got bed, I fell asleep. I quite know far night I roused Fatima's voice repeating name again, tones subdued terror. I know nothing irritatingly alarming, one young nervous, roused thus voice terror evident unknown. "'What matter?' I asked. "'Do hear?' gasped Fatima, whisper. "If said robber bed, burglar window, ghost wardrobe, I prepared worst, would less alarming unknown evil. "'I hear nothing,' I said, pettishly. 'I wish would go sleep, Fatima.' "'There!--now!' said Fatima. "I held breath, silence heard distinctly sound one snoring adjoining apartment. "'It one snoring,' I said. "'Where?' asked Fatima, tragedy voice unabated. "'In room behind us, course,' I said, impatiently. 'Cannot hear?' "Fatima's voice might voice shadow answered: '_There room there._' "And cold chill crept also; I remembered wall behind snoring unmistakably proceeded outer wall. There room old Mr. Bartlett, son-in-law murderer pulled down. There heard 'breathing heavily,' seen asleep upon bed, long smothered pillows, body shut family vault. At least, said, particular moment felt comfort fact Miss Lucy said 'of course true.' I said something, Fatima made reply, I could feel trembling, hear half-choked sob. I think fear overpowered alarm, gave sort strength. "'Do not, dear,' I begged. 'Let us brave. It must something else. And nothing room. Let us go Bedford. She next door one.' "Fatima could speak more. By moonlight blind, I jumped up, half dragged, half helped bed across room. Opening door worst. To touch anything moment trial. We groped passage; I felt handle first door, turned second, went. The window-blind room drawn up, moonlight streamed everything. A nest white drapery covered one chair, muslin dress lay like sick ghost second, little black satin shoes web-like stockings floor, gold watch one two feminine ornaments lay table; bed reposed--not Bedford, friend Kate, fast asleep, one arm bed-clothes, long red hair pigtail streaming pillow. I climbed treated Fatima treated me, calling low, frightened tones again. She woke last, sat up. "'You sprites! What matter?' exclaimed. "I stumbled account misfortunes, middle young lady lay down, ended I believe asleep again. Poor Fatima, saw nothing us return room terrors, began sob violently, roused friend more, became full pity. "'You poor children!' said, 'I sleepy. I cannot get go ghost now; besides, one might meet somebody. But may get bed like; plenty room, nothing frighten you.' "In crept, willingly. She gave us long tail hair, said, 'If want me, pull. But go sleep, can!'--and, well finished sentence, eyes closed more. In good company snoring ghost seemed thing hardly realized. We held long plait us, and, clinging drowning men rope, soon slept also. "When returned room next day, snoring heard, full sunshine summer morning fright seemed completely thing past, I persuaded suggest might 'fancy' (Kate already expressed deliberate opinion effect), Fatima, whose convictions resolute type mine, replied, 'What use trying believe true? I heard it; shall know I heard it, I live till I hundred.' "In correct ghost stories, hero comes morning, valiant, exhausted terrors night, breakfast, host invariably asks slept. When came down, found Kate Irishman alone together breakfast-room. Now certainly keeping adventure stepped forward, and, bowing profoundly, asked passed night; but, spite gravity face, twinkle big brown eyes showed us made fun of; I felt slightly indignant friend, faithfully promised betray us Miss Lucy, might, I thought, saved us ridicule Irishman. The rest company began assemble, however, relief subject dropped. But though Irishman kept secret, every reason suspect forget it; looked terribly roguish breakfast, kept order Kate's severe glances. "'Always breathe nose,' suddenly began. 'It moderates severity air, less trying lungs, prevents snoring.' "'Very true,' said major, sensible, liked instructive observations. "'It may laid axiom,' continued Irishman, gravely, 'that man snores sure disturb somebody; also man snore till dies, likely live snoring ghost dead.' "Kate looked daggers. The major laughed, said, 'Let give beef.' When understand remark always laughed, generally turned conversation eatables, pretty safe; food common ground, slight laugh answers remarks, unless serious meeting visit condolence. A little later Irishman asked: 'What origin expression stir long pole?' turned conversation wild beasts. But presently inquired: 'What meaning putting thing spout?' "'Pawning it,' said major, promptly. "'People pawn family jewels sometimes,' said Pat. 'Did ever hear anybody pawning family ghosts?' asked, suddenly turning me. I gave distressed 'No,' continued whisper, 'You never saw ghost spout?' "But, I could answer, caught Kate's eye, and, making penitent face, became silent. "We drawing-room breakfast, Irishman passed window outside, whistling 'Kathleen Mavourneen.' We sitting Kate's feet, got up, whispering, 'He got something show you, would let tell,' went garden, following her. "There found Irishman, long pole, waving triumphantly air. He bowed approached. "'This, young ladies,' said, 'is original long pole spoken breakfast-table. With I stir bring forth inspection living identical ghost whose snoring disturbed repose last night.' "The little Irishman's jokes reassured me. I guessed found clue mysterious noise; Fatima otherwise. She deeply frightened recover easily. She clung tremblingly me, I following him, whispered 'I would rather not.' "On behalf I summoned courage remonstrate. "'If please, sir,' I said, 'Fatima would rather not; and, please, tease us more.' "The young lady added entreaties, needed. The good-natured little gentleman sooner saw Fatima's real distress lowered pole, sank upon knees grass, face genuine penitence. "'I _am_ sorry I tormenting so!' exclaimed. 'I forgot really frightened, see I knew ghost.' "'I heard it,' murmured Fatima resolutely, eyes half shut. "'So I,' said Irishman, gaily; 'I heard dozens times. It owls.' "We exclaimed. "'Ah!' said, comically, 'I see believe me! That comes telling many small fibs. But true, I assure you. (And brown eyes look particularly truthful.) Barn-door owls make noise like snoring old man. And young ones live spout corner wall room. They snoring scrambling spout night.' "It quite true, Ida, found, Fatima last persuaded visit corner rooms pulled down, where, decorated ivy, old spout formed home snoring owls. By aid long pole brought young one view--a shy, soft, lovely, shadow-tinted creature, ghostly enough behold, felt like impalpable mass fluff, utterly refused kissed, went savagely blinking back spout earliest possible opportunity. His snoring alarmed us more." "And noise really that?" said Ida. "It really was, dear." "It splendid story," said Ida; "you see, I go sleep _this_ time. And became everybody, please? Did red-haired young lady marry Irishman?" "Very soon afterwards, dear," said Mrs. Overtheway. "We kept friendship, too, life; I many times amused children story Snoring Ghost." REKA DOM. "What home, where, loving?" FELICIA HEMANS. At last Ida allowed go out. She well wrapped up, escorted Nurse short walk good health. It amusing, air fresh change pleasant, although street prove quite happy region looked nursery windows. Moreover, however strong one may fancy one become indoors, convalescent's first efforts doors apt feeble white moth crept shelter cocoon, giddy daylight, trembling open air. By-and-by feeling passed away, one afternoon Ida allowed go garden, "just run." The expression metaphorical, far able run; crept quietly walks, gathered polyanthuses, putting face pleasure touch fresh flowers gives invalid. Then saw hedge budding, gap scrambled filled up. Ida thought expedition smiled. It certainly made ill, but--it led Mrs. Overtheway. The little old lady come day, evening Ida sent uncle. She downstairs evenings since illness. These interviews reserved old gentleman always formal, uncomfortable affairs, Ida escaped sense relief, evening--being weak illness disappointed Mrs. Overtheway's absence--her nervousness almost amounted terror. Nurse best way encouragement. It true Ida's uncle merry gentleman, nice dessert! What could well-behaved young lady desire wear best frock, eat almonds raisins dining-room, lady house? "Though I sorry child," Nurse confided butler left Ida uncle, "for looks enough frighten grown person, let alone little girl. And go presently, like good soul, find excuse, let see cheerful face." But kind-hearted old man-servant could find plausible pretext intruding dining-room, giving encouraging smile behind master's chair, Ida nursery more. She honestly endeavoured good. She made curtsey door without falter--weak was. She taken place head table dignity, accepted almonds raisins sufficiently audible thanks. She replied prettily enough uncle's inquiries health; and, anxious keep conversation, told hedge budding. "_What's_ matter hedge?" asked rather sharply; Ida repeated bit spring news, seemed interested. It part gardener's work. Ida relapsed silence, uncle. But all. He sharp eyes, fierce bushy eyebrows, apt scrutinize Ida way seemed scatter presence mind. This night nights found eyes upon oftener usual. Whenever looked watching her, discomfort increased accordingly. At last broke silence abruptly saying: "You sorry, child, not, news came father's death?" The sudden introduction sacred subject made Ida's head reel. "What?" cried, could get further. "Have forgotten already?" old gentleman said, almost reprovingly. "You know him, true; must remember hearing poor father drowned sea?" Ida's reply passionate outburst weeping uncle rang bell helpless dismay, thankful old butler lifted child tenderly arms carried back Nurse. The old gentleman's feelings kindly looks, really much concerned puzzled effect remarks. When butler returned report Ida going quietly bed, sent "love" (the word seemed struggle difficulty behind neck-cloth), remaining almonds raisins. "I cannot eat them," said Ida, smiling feebly, head aching, "but kind him; please tell Brown tell I sorry, please put almonds raisins box. I make dolls feast them, ever I make dolls' feasts again." With weary little maid turned upon pillow, last forgot troubles sleep. The next morning Brown delivered similar message old gentleman. He gone away early train business, left Ida love. "It kind him," said Ida, again. But went sadly paper cutting shapes. She low spirits morning. Comfort hand, however. In course day came message Mrs. Overtheway, asking Nurse allow Ida go tea evening. And Nurse consented. Ida could hardly believe senses found little old lady's fireside. How dainty room was! How full bookshelves were! How many pictures hung upon walls! Above little table, innumerable pretty things, hung two pictures. One portrait man who, apparent age, might old lady's son, like her. He might good-looking, though, Ida thought, kind, intelligent face, full energy understanding, better still. Close portrait hung little sketch. It road running river. Opposite river house trees. It pretty sketch, Ida thought, road looked interesting, roads pictures--making one wish get frame walk see whither lead. Below sketch curious-looking characters written ink, Ida could make nothing. Tea soon ready. It spread little table itself. The white cloth seemed Ida whitest ever seen, silver glass glittered, china covered rosebud pattern, reading-lamp threw clear soft light all. The tea, cream, brown bread butter, fresh eggs, honey--all best--even waiting-maid pretty, something old lady's smile. When finished duties taking away things, putting tea-table corner, two friends drew fire. "You look better tea, child," said little old lady. "Do eat enough home?" "As much I can," said Ida, "but I hungry somebody else tea me. There seldom anybody till came though. Only twice Lady Cheetham's housekeeper tea. She Nurse's father's first cousin, 'quite lady,' Nurse says. So let tea kitchen, Nurse tea nursery, lots tea-cakes jam, Nurse keeps saying, 'Help yourself, Miss Ida! Make home, Mrs. Savory!' And, know, times, always telling night tea. So I generally eat good deal then, I often laugh, Nurse Mrs. Savory funny together. But Mrs. Savory's kind, last time came brought pincushion, time gave Spa mug two apples." Mrs. Overtheway laughed, too, Ida's rambling account, two high good-humour. "What shall I amuse you?" asked little old lady. "You could tell another story?" said Ida, accent meant, "I hope can!" "I would, gladly, dear, I know tell about;" looked round room stories furniture perhaps were. Ida's eyes followed her, remembered picture, said: "Oh! would please tell writing means pretty little sketch?" The little old lady smiled rather sadly, looked sketch silence moments. Then said: "It Russian, dear. Their letters different ours. The words 'Reka Dom' mean 'River House.'" Ida gazed drawing increased interest. "Oh, remember anything it? If would tell _that_!" cried. But Mrs. Overtheway silent again. She looking down, twisting rings upon little hand, Ida felt ashamed asked. "I beg pardon," said, imploringly. "I rude, dear Mrs. Overtheway; tell like, please." "You good child," said little old lady, "a good child, dear. I _do_ remember much house, I fall day-dreams I look it. It brings back memories great deal pleasure great deal pain. But one advantage old, little Ida, Time softens painful remembrances, leaves us happy ones, grow clearer every day." "Is yourself?" Ida asked, timidly. She quite understood little old lady's speech; indeed, understand many things Mrs. Overtheway said, satisfactory companions that. "Yes, myself. And since dear child cares old Mrs. Overtheway, prosy stories, befell long ago," said little old lady, smiling affectionately Ida, "I tell story--my story--the story Reka Dom." "Oh, good you!" cried Ida. "There much merit it," said little old lady. "The story much you. I tell bits every evening tea, I used do. I look far back, I endeavour look far forward. I try picture greater happiness, companionship perfect I known; I shall able realize them, I shall found better Home Reka Dom." Ida crept little old lady's feet, softly stroked slipper rested fender. Then, March wind howled beyond curtains, made cosy corner fire, composed hear story. "I remember," said Mrs. Overtheway. "I remember Reka Dom. It new home.

"'I want tidy box new baby-house, _dreadfully_,' added sister. "'I hope deep window-places,' sighed luxurious Fatima, 'with print patchwork cushions, like farm. And I hope face west, sunsets.' "'Above all'--and final impressive charge I received--'whatever else wanting, let us two tall trees swing.' "Laden responsibility, otherwise light-hearted enough, I set parents early coach, put us mid-day little town river. "I liked travelling father. What father was! But, indeed, object special devotion me, character exercised strong influence young days, I think, dear Ida, I must take old woman's privilege discursiveness, tell something him.

This accounted fact that, absent somewhat unpractical home, invaluable journey, making arrangements, managing officials precision old habit.

"With age knowledge foolish fancies I wove father melted away, peculiar affection I felt him, natural love daughter, increased I grew up. Our tastes harmonious, always understood other; whereas Fatima apt awed stateliness, puzzled jokes, times provoked eccentricities. Then I never robust youth; refined considerate politeness made point displaying family peculiarly grateful me.

"The book I chose would look dull eyes, I dare say, dear Ida; live age bright, smart story-books, clear type, coloured pictures, gorgeous outsides.

"As wandered on, passed line small bright-looking houses, strongly caught fancy. Each gay little garden, shrubbery lilac, holly, laurustinus, creeper-covered porch. They looked compact cosy, easy keep tidy, snug sunny, one fancied people lived must happy, wondered were. "'Oh, father!' I exclaimed, 'what delightful houses!' "'They pretty, dear,' answered; 'but much small us; besides which, occupied.' "I sighed, passing on, I held back another exclamation. "'Oh! _look_ carnations!' For one gardens large clumps splendid scarlet cloves caught eye. "My father humoured me, drew near laurustinus hedge, looked gay little garden. As looked, became conscious appeared like heap bundle clothing near one beds, which, lifting up, proved tall slender lady middle age, who, dress tucked neatly round her, big print hood head, trowel hand, busily administering tender little attentions mothers lavish children, garden lovers flowers.

"'Yes, dear; know till afterwards. When good lady lifted up, saw us, seemed startled. My father raised hat, apologized politely. 'My little girl much taken carnations, madam,' said, 'that made bold come near enough look them, knowing one garden.' "She seemed rather flustered, pushed back hood, made stiff little curtsey answer father's bow, murmured something welcome. "'Would care some, dear?' added, looking me. I gave delighted assent, gathered two lovely carnations, heard quavering voice green shade inquire-- "'What it?' "Our friend old gentleman's side moment, speaking distinctly ear, deaf, whereby heard answer, "'It gentleman little daughter, James, admiring carnations, I gathering young lady, dear James.' "'Quite right, quite right,' croaked. 'Anything have. Anything have.' "It great satisfaction afterwards remember father thanked good people 'properly,' I considered. As myself, I able blush stammer something far expressing delight lovely nosegay I received. Then slender lady went back gardening. Her sister took knitting laid down, old gentleman nodded lamp-shade direction supposed us said, 'Good evening, sir, Good evening, miss;' went way. "The road wound on, down, found edge river. A log lay conveniently bank, seated ourselves. The tide out, river bed bed mud except narrow stream water ran middle. But, ah! mud glistened evening sunshine reflected prismatic colours. Little figures dotted surface, seawards masts vessels loomed large shining haze. "'How beautiful everything looks evening!' I exclaimed. "'I see walking air glory,' murmured father, dreamily. "He quoting favourite old poem, begins-- 'They gone world light, And I alone sit lingering here.' "This 'air glory,' indeed, everything. The mud tide pools, dark human figures, black white seagulls sat like onyx pebbles river bed, stream spread seawards like silver scroll, swans came sailing, sailing stream slow stately pace white-winged ships might come river tide, pass (as swans pass) 'world light,' shining seaward haze, eye could follow unless shaded hand.

For part, I fancied established one little houses 'hostess,' sign-board fish painted upon hanging outside door, bower woodbine, sweet-briar, jessamine, myrtle commanding view river. The day dream broken father's voice. "'Mary, dear, must go business, mother say us? We must see houses. We cannot live river's bank.' "'I wish could,' I sighed; though risen turned away, I lingered still. At moment father exclaimed-- "'Bless soul!' I jumped turned round. "He staring wall gateway it, enclosing house garden side road. On two gateposts printed black Roman letters two words I could understand--_Reka Dom_. "'What mean?' I asked. "'Reka Dom?' said father thoughtfully (and pronounced _Rayka Dome_). 'It Russian. It means River House. Very curious! I suppose people live Russians. It nice situation--a lovely view--_lovely_!' turned round river, I caught arm. "'Father, dear, one lives here. Look!' I pointed board beyond gateway, stated plain English house let. * * * * * "By time returned mother, Reka Dom intents purposes home. "It true house old, rambling, repair, heard landlord encouraging. He rich, told, miserly; 'a queer old gentleman,' whose oddness almost amounted insanity. He 'made unpleasant' various people thought taking house, drew back, Reka Dom untenanted time. The old woman took care it, got information, prophesied would 'do nothing old place. He would let fall ears first.' "It also true standing garden (which rambling, disorderly way charming, commanded lovely view), father rubbed head ruefully, said: "'You know, Mary, mother's chief objection latest home grounds much large means keeping order; garden larger two, I fear.' "And seem derive proportionate comfort reply. "'But, father dear, know need keep order, play in.' "And yet took Reka Dom. "The fact father I took fancy place. On side easily accounted for. If houses looked proved direct reverse I (on behalf brothers sisters) search of, Reka Dom remarkable degree answered requirements. To explore garden like tour fairy land. It oddly laid out. Three grass-plots lawns, one behind another, divided hedges honeysuckle sweet-briar. The grass long, flower-borders borders desolation, crimson pæonies hardy perennials made best it, odour honeysuckle luxuriously sweet evening air. And place bowers! The second lawn greater things store me. There, two tall elm trees hung swing. With cry delight I seated myself, seized ropes, gave vigorous push. But impetus strong, ropes rotten, I swing came ground together. This deter me, however, exploring third lawn, I made discovery swing nothing. "It merely small path shrubbery led little enclosed piece ground devoted many-shaped, box-edged little flower-beds characteristic 'children's gardens,'--it alone beds shaped like letters, indisputably M among them--but six number. Just one apiece brothers sisters! And though families six children uncommon make improbable father's predecessor number young ones himself, coincidence appeared mind almost supernatural. It really seemed kind old fairy conjured whole place benefit. And--bless good godmother!--to crown all, two old tea-chests bottomless barrel yard. "Doubtless many causes influenced father _his_ leaning towards Reka Dom, confide me. But I truly believe first foremost attractions name. To real hearty lover languages charm sight strange character, new words, yet unknown tongue, cannot explained share taste. And perhaps next mystic attraction words whose meaning yet hidden, discover traces foreign language unexpected unlikely place. Russian extensively cultivated; father's knowledge slight, quiet little water-side town unlikely place inscription language. It curious, interesting, quaint simple title house took fancy. Besides this, though could allow reason mother's views subject large grounds combination one man-of-all-work, liked plenty space shrubbery could wander about--his hands behind back--without disturbed; part undoubtedly felt pleasure possession large grounds annoyance seeing neglected. So garden tempted him. Finally, room opening upon laurel walk, one time library. The shelves--old, common, dirty broken--were still there, secure housekeeper kept cheese candles, old shawl bonnet. "'The place made us!' I exclaimed return discovering old barrel tea-chests. My father standing library looking upon garden, say No. "From old woman learnt something former tenants. She good-natured old soul, aggrieved tone voice, due probably depressing effects keeping empty house cantankerous landlord. The former tenant's name Smith, said (unmistakably English this!).

Though sense was, offer explain. "'Please, please take it!' I whispered pause conversation! 'there six little gardens, and--' "My father broke mock horror face: 'Do speak six gardens!' exclaimed. 'The one condemn place, I fear, must go home consult mother.' "I suppose consult her. "I know described charms house garden, passed rather poor examination condition, might expected landlord. That father endeavoured conceal personal bias, I made secret mine. At last mother interrupted elaborately practical details saying gentle voice-- "'I think choosing home something like choosing companion life. It chiefly important like it. There must faults everywhere. Do take place, dear?' "'I like certainly,' said father. 'But question I like, like.' "Then I knew settled, breathed freely. For though father always consulted mother's wishes, generally contrived choose knew would prefer. And chose Reka Dom. * * * * * "Henceforward good luck seemed follow new home. "First, landlord. The old woman certainly exaggerated oddity. But one peculiarities fortunate one us. He bibliomaniac--a lover collector valuable curious books. When father called arrange house, found sitting almost rags, apparently dining upon cheese-parings, surrounded library, value would fed clothed comfort almost indefinite period. Upon chair behind sat large black cat yellow eyes. "When father ushered in, gazed moment silent astonishment unexpected sight. Books shelf shelf ceiling, piled heaps upon floor.

"These good people were, I said, chief friends; Reka Dom afforded us ample amusement. The six children lived us source unfailing interest. The old woman house remained place short time capacity charwoman, suffered many inquiries part names, ages, peculiarities predecessors. As 'charred' them, able satisfy curiosity considerable extent, great pleasure retailing mother, sat knitting twilight, anecdotes collected 'the little Russians.' "'The Little Russians' certainly much cement attachment Reka Dom. Their history history home. It romance walks played in, swing sat in, gardens tended every day.

But consideration appeared remaining letters fit names brothers sisters, way distributing must found. My mother last decided letters six beds written six separate bits paper, put bag, one drawn turn.

Then whole class partisan games gave us wonderful entertainment. Sometimes pretended Scottish chieftains, feudal barons England, chiefs savage tribes.

As chief MacIvans I felt justly proud title, brother represented MacElizabeths less fortunate. In sham battles pet animals (we one) duty retainers, much bewilderment.

"But father's library furnished another volume garden studies. From I inherited taste finds magic attraction dictionaries grammars; I wish I properly mastered half languages delight girlhood dabble. As yet, however, I looked 'grammar corner' ambitious eyes, till one day came upon desire learn Russian. I asked father Russian grammar, pointed one possessed.

But progress slow, last I got father write _Reka Dom_ Russian character, I determined master letters first proceed. I soon became familiar them, little proud achievement. I made large copy fasten upon nursery wall; I wrote books; Fatima, could induced attack fat grammar me, became equally absorbed part effort reduce inscription cross-stitch benefit sampler.

"When sham battles ended real quarrels, following footsteps little Russians becoming irksome--(especially Fatima, whose predecessor--Peter--had military turn, begun fortifications near kitchen garden incompetent carry out) new idea struck me. I announced letters properly written addressed little Russians, 'Reka Dom, Russia,' posted old rhubarb-pot tool-house, would duly answered. The replies found week's time office.

'You know Mary little Russian, since Ivan dead.' "When visible pets died, buried much pomp, sound drum tin trumpet, piece ground cabbage-bed; present instance ceremony impossible. We resolved, however, erect gravestone memory fancy friend garden. I seen letters cut stone, confident chisel hammer nothing could easier. These nursery tool-box furnished. I wrote elaborate inscription headed Reka Dom Russian characters, got stone set work. The task, however, harder supposed. My long composition discarded, resolved content simple sentence, _To memory Ivan_. But 'brevity soul wit,' TO took long cut, threw three words, epitaph finally stood thus: TO IVAN. "In rude fashion accomplished; crape arms accustomed music set stone among lilies. * * * * * "In time, Ida, grew up, called. Almost knew it, whilst still seemed looking forward emancipation nursery authority childish frocks, Fatima I found grown-up young ladies, free fashion costume tastes, far Reka Dom. Yes, changed home again. The River House longer. Childhood also slipped grasp, slowly years seemed pass, sufficed accomplish every project made them. Not one long summers river seen gorgeous display flowers garden good faith energy planned every spring. I learnt Russian. Years gone since I first took fat grammar, I acquired little since time beyond familiar characters well-beloved name, Reka Dom. "The country town circumstances made home possessed least one attraction us. It old friends Misses Brooke settled brother's death broke quiet little household. I fond good ladies; less I child, home-made buns faded albums made evening festive, looked forward treat. They good women, severe charitable others, cultivated grace humility almost excess. One little weakness, however, otherwise estimable characters times disturbed even course friendship. I hardly know call it. It want candour. More truthful women exist were, I believe never wilfully deceived anyone. I describe habit indulging small plots suspicions; want trust people, partly traceable, perhaps, lack due confidence themselves, provoking one young, eager, sincerely affectionate I was. I indignant discover little plots laid test sincerity; find genuine (if minutely measured) expressions feeling doubted. If peculiarity troublesome early stages acquaintance, doubly met again, lapse years. For one thing, dear ladies older, fidgety, foolish little weaknesses kind sometimes increase years. Then I older also, doubted powers entertainment I child, would still less believe I could enjoy society I 'young lady.' Whereas truth was, though taste buns reverence smooth pencil drawings impossible perspective certainly diminished, real enjoyment quiet evening old friends greater before. I liked take sewing undisturbed fireside, pieces work flagged constant interruptions home rapidly finished I chatted them. I liked draw acquirements would believe possessed. I enjoyed rubbing modern desultory reading old-fashioned solid knowledge. I admired high delicate principles, respected almost fatiguing modesty. At age religious questions move often seriously trouble girls' minds, I drew comfort piety, (although quiet modest virtues) years, eyes, ruling principle did, subject courage speak decision, crown affections pleasures, sufficient consolation sorrow. In addition this, I went them, I knew visit gave pleasure. "It seemed hard could always repose similar confidence me. And yet was. The consistent affection years failed convince 'a young, pretty, lively girl' (as pleased call me) could find pleasure society 'two dull old women.' So apt suspect either second motive visit, affectation appearance enjoyment. At times I chafed almost beyond powers endurance fancies; one occasion vexation broke bounds respect. "'You think uncandid, madam,' I cried; 'and you? If hear I spoken you, elsewhere, two dull old women, would much astonished angered. You know would. You know think I think so. I cannot imagine say it!' "And feelings much way logic women, I got further, broke tears. "'She says uncandid, Mary' sobbed Miss Martha. "'So are, I believe,' said Miss Mary, cried together. "I think protracted worry misunderstanding (which long one) made almost hysterical. I clearly remember feeling lying face horsehair sofa little dining-room, feebly repeating, 'You not, know. You not!' amid tears, hair softly stroked two sisters, comforted me, blamed depth self-abasement almost made laugh. It hardly seemed possible customary humility could go lower. The affair wound good deal kissing, tea, suspicions long time. * * * * * "There peace, I said, long. But as, best times, Misses Brooke never gave us invitation without going form apologizing probable dulness entertainment, I surprised one morning find invited tea Belle Vue Cottage following evening, strict condition I refuse invitation I felt disinclined go. I met good ladies came church. There Morning Prayer Wednesdays Fridays one church town, two little straw bonnets Misses Brooke seen bending side side every service, rest scanty congregation would much astonished every one town time opportunity public worship availed privilege. On day usual, turned street together, invitation given. "'And could induce respected father come you, Mary dear?' added Miss Mary. 'You know rooms small, glad see Fatima. But friends coming, understand.' "'Only few,' Miss Martha said, hastily. 'Do make think anything worth coming for, Mary. And mind, Mary dear, care come, say so. There need "excuses" us. And know exactly tea-parties are.' "'Now, Miss Martha,' I said, shaking fist her, 'I bear it!' "'Well, dear, know true. And invitation Lodge to-morrow night, mind throw us over. There dancing heavy supper Cottage.' "'I eat pound beefsteak private hornpipe fortify I come, madam. And Lightfoots ask then, I think throwing oldest friends oblige you!' "'You clever, dear,' sighed Miss Martha, 'and easy laugh stupid old woman like me.' "Now rather unfair, I taken banter occasions serious treatment subject failed. I made peace, however, grave affectionate assurances I wished come, would like come; adding solemn promise I felt averse time came, I would stay home. "I vexed find symptoms old misunderstanding arising. The good ladies evidently fidgety humour to-day, going home full it, I poured vexation Fatima. "Fatima's composure easily ruffled mine. She apt sit easy, graceful attitudes, looking idle, getting wonderful amount exquisite needlework, listening passing grievances without much disturbed herself. "'I think I would worry myself,' said, rapidly sorted greens leaf embroidery. 'My idea is, find party lively usual. I often noticed old ladies particularly full apologies, something somebody expected.' "'I want anything anybody,' I said, dolefully; 'but I wish would take fancies, I wish would put one cross-examinations nothing. As party, could be, old set?' "'Nobody, I suppose. There Wilkinsons, course;' Fatima marked fact emphatic stitch. 'And Mr. Ward, I suppose, Dr. Brown, Jones's girls, and--' "'Oh, rooms would hold more!' I said. "'There always room one more--for gentleman rate; and, depend upon it, I say.' "Fatima fond Misses Brooke I was. She scruple complain trouble cost maintain intimate relations excellent touchy old ladies, hot water trifles one must perpetually fall. "'I hope I pretty trustworthy,' would say, 'and I sure are, Mary. And not, let drop acquaintance. But treat friends used treat flowers Reka Dom! They always taking see going on, I like vegetate peace.' "I could criticized dear respected old friends freely; yet I knew Fatima spoke truth. "The subject unexpectedly renewed dinner. "'Mary,' said father, 'is mystery connected tea-party Miss Brooke's?' "Fatima gave mischievous glance. "'If is, sir,' said I, 'I secret.' "'I met town,' went on, 'and good enough invite me; I must see Ward registers, I ventured ask party (thinking save old legs walk place). The matter simple enough, Miss Martha seemed fancy I wanted know going there. I fully explained real object, either hear believe me, I suppose, gave list expected company.' "'I sure would believed you, sir, realized saying,' I said. 'I know sort thing, I think generally absorbed efforts think want, spare attention say.' "'A ingenious bit special pleading, dear, heard all. I made best bow turning away, Miss Martha, begging excuse her, asked good deal mystery agitation _you_ commissioned find party. I said I seen since breakfast, I quite able assure wished find anything subject, would gone direct herself, I repeated best bow best style, escaped.' "I much hurt speak, Fatima took conversation father. "'You go, sir?' said. "'Of course, dear, Mary wishes it. Besides, Ward _is_ there. I learnt much.' "'You learnt more, sir,' said Fatima, 'and please leave us die curiosity. Who there, all?' "'The Wilkinsons, Miss Jones sister, Ward, old friend Miss Brooke's, merchant.' "'But name, please!' cried Fatima, father retreating study. "'Smith--John Smith,' answered laughing, left alone. "I much disposed injured gloomy, Fatima would allow it. She successful comforter. In first place, thoroughly sympathetic; second, great dislike disturbance general peace harmony, last, easy, cheerful view things became infectious serious troubles concerned. "'People must little weaknesses,' said, 'and I sure many failings.' "'This weakness unworthy them,' I complained. " good people's weaknesses unworthy them, dear. And better are, unworthy weakness appears. Now, Mary, reasonable! You know bottom true are, fond you. Pray allow fidgety fancies, poor old dears. No doubt shall fidgety old. I sure I shall many fancies hairs wig, you, considering little things weigh mind now--' "Fatima's reasoning conclusive, I think I came last believe Miss Brooke's distrust creditable herself, complimentary me--so certainly must convincing. "'And now,' concluded, 'come upstairs forget it. For I got two new ideas I want opinion. The first new stitch, I purpose work muslin dresses us both. I thought bed morning. The second new plan braiding hair, came head whilst father reading aloud speech us last night. I fastened last plait laid paper.' "'You absurd Fatima!' I cried. 'How could you! And interesting!' "'Do look shocked,' said Fatima. 'I shall never politician. Of studies, politics seems disturbing uncomfortable. If angel, inspired person would tell side right, believe in, I could capital partisan. As is, I worry it; last night looking flushed excited end speech, I calmly happy--' "'But, Fatima,' I broke in, 'you mean say--' "'If lasted five minutes longer,' said Fatima, 'I comfortably decided whether ferns ivy would combine better loops.' "'But, Fatima! really listening when--' "'On whole I decide ivy,' said Fatima, danced room, I following attempting one remonstrance hall. "'But, Fatima!--' "'With perhaps suspicion white chrysanthemums,' added banisters. "Both new ideas promised successful, following evening hair dressed Fatima called political plaits. From first evening introduction society established lady's maid. She took generous delight dressing up, clever kind it. This evening seemed surpassed herself, I judged admiring exclamations younger sister Phillis--a good little maid, stood behind chair combs pins hand Fatima's aide-de-camp. Finally, dexterous fingers interwove sprays ivy hair, added white rosebuds lack chrysanthemums. "'Perfect!' Fatima exclaimed, stepping backwards gestures admiration provokingly visible glass I sat. 'And think wasted uninteresting tea-party! You wear new muslin, course?' "'Indeed, I shall,' I answered. 'You know I always make smart Cottage.' Which true, reason this. I gone quiet tea-party dress rather smart occasion, looked doubly gay contrast sombre costume elderly friends I met. I feeling vexed error taste, Miss Mary came me, laying hands affectionately me, smoothing ribbons, thanked come pretty costume. "'You come in, dear,' said, 'like fresh nosegay winter. You see old women, love, dress mostly black, since dear James's death; friends chiefly elderly sombre-looking also. So great treat us look something young pretty, remember girls, took pains things ourselves.' "'I afraid I smart, Miss Mary,' I said. "'To sure waste wear pretty things here,' Miss Mary added; 'but might let us know sometimes going grand party, come look you.' "I touched humble little lady's speech, thought little one apt realize fact faded, fretful, trouble-worn people middle life young, remember youth. "Thenceforward I made careful toilettes Cottage, night exception rule. "I dressed early; father rather late, three girls nearly hour's chat I go. "We began discuss merchant vary monotony small social circle. Phillis heard strange gentleman arrived town afternoon London stage. Fatima idea subject boldly stated. One Misses Brooke going married--to London merchant. We age real life romance attractive, town rich romances--at least, little society. So Fatima's idea found great favour us, and, described it, seemed really probable. Here old friend, friend youth, probably lover, turned again, sisters natural state agitation. (It fully accounted Miss Martha's suspicious sensitiveness yesterday, I felt ashamed aggrieved.) Doubtless lovers allowed marry early life poor. They parted, remained faithful. He made fortune, like Dick Whittington, now, rich London merchant, come back take old love home. Being old friend, obviously youthful attachment; merchant, must rich. This happy combination--universal fiction, though invariable real life--was could desired, received strong confirmation fact coming London; days country girls seldom visited metropolis, regarded great city awe, centre wealthy wonderful. It charming story, though could wish returned Miss Martha took 'front' spectacles, yet pictured comfortable domestic future them; Fatima positive 'worlds' might done appearance future Mrs. Smith tasteful costume, longed ardently assume direction toilette. "'I believe need wear front,' pleaded. 'I daresay plenty pretty grey hair underneath. Spectacles intellectual, properly worn; which, by, need meals husband looking across table; caps--' "But father knocked door, I put cloak hood, went him. "The Misses Brooke received us affectionately, I thought excitement, flush Miss Martha's cheeks almost made smile. I could keep Fatima's fancy head. Indeed, I picturing old friend cheerful matronly costume presiding elegant belongings stout, well-to-do, comfortable Mr. John Smith, I moved little room, exchanged mechanical smiles greetings familiar guests. I settled sober couple fireside, hesitating dove-colour lavender-grey wedding silk, Miss Martha disturbed I decided important question. I fancied slight tremor voice said-- "'Mr. John Smith.' "I dropped formal curtsey I hitherto done, due stranger gentleman, looked object benevolent fancies, mittens. His head coming low bow, instantaneous impression was, 'He wears brown wig.' But moment upright, I saw not. And--he certainly suitable point age. I took one glance make sure, meeting eyes, turned hastily, plunged conversation nearest neighbour, noticing instant was. As I recovered momentary confusion, I became aware I talking rector's wife, advanced opinions subject weather energetically disputing. I yielded gracefully, went back thoughts. I hope Miss Martha feel I loss suitable, comfortable, middle-aged partner fancy provided her. It seem pity existence. I thought probably marriage happiest condition people, felt inclined discuss question rector's wife, twenty-two years' exemplary experience state. Then I like helped choose silk-- "At point I asked play. "I played favourite things Miss Brooke's own, Mr. Smith turning leaves music; asked sing, astonishment, prepared accompany himself. Few English gentlemen (if any) could accompany songs pianoforte youth, Ida; wise idea pianoforte instrument 'only fit women,' would soon thought trying learn play upon studying spinning-wheel. I know I ever heard one play except father, lived much abroad. When Mr. Smith sat instrument, I withdrew corner, Miss Martha followed talk. But began, I think every one silent. "The song sang old one now, Ida, comparatively new then, happened us heard before. It 'Home, Sweet Home.' He charming voice, sweet pathetic ring it, singing would redeemed song far smaller merit, sentiment less common hearers. As was, sympathies taken storm. The rector's wife sobbed audibly, but, I believe, happily, oblique reference ten children left home; poor Miss Martha, behind me, touched away tear tear thin finger-tips, finally took pocket-handkerchief, thoughts dear dead brother, little house garden, I know earlier home still. As me, I thought Reka Dom. "We many homes, _the_ home _par excellence_--the beloved father, beloved us all. And clear voice sang refrain, sounded ears like tender cry recall past happiness, 'Home--Home--sweet, sweet Home!' I stroked Miss Martha's knee silent sympathy, saw Reka Dom eyes. The river seemed flow melody. I swung tune elm-trees, Walton Cotton lap. What would Piscator thought it, milkmaid sung song? I roamed three lawns better pleasures palaces, stood among box-edged gardens. Then refrain called back again-- 'Home--Home--sweet, sweet Home!' I almost glad ended I, too, quite broke down. "Everybody crowded round singer admiration song, inquiries it. "'I heard concert town day,' said, 'and struck pretty, I got copy. It English opera called "Clari," seems pretty thing it.' "'Do like it?' Miss Jones asked me; I suppose I spoken. "'I think lovely,' I said, 'as far I judge; carries one away criticism; I think I thinking music; I thinking Home.' "'Exactly.' "It Miss Jones said 'Exactly,' merchant, standing her; said it, indefinite tone polite assent people commonly smile answers other's remarks evening parties, understood words thought thought. We three fell conversation song--about 'Clari'--about opera--the theatre--about London; Dr. Brown, educated great city, joined us, finally Miss Jones took London subject themselves, merchant continued talk me. He pleasant company, chiefly alive intelligence much less trouble talk one I ever met, except father. He required much less average amount explanation. It hardly seemed possible use words seize meaning ends, speak; root idea sprang from, conclusion tended. "We talked music--of singing--of new song, subject it--home. And home-love, patriotism, characters nations feeling seemed predominate. "'Like everything else, depends partly circumstances, I suppose,' said. 'I sometimes envy people one home--the eldest son landed proprietor, instance. I fancy I much home-love people, divided; I homes one.' "'_I_ homes one,' I said; 'but I think divided. At least, one homes much dearer others.' "'Do think latest, feelings freshest?' asked. "I laughed. 'A bad guess. It present home. This one near river.' "'Exactly.' "This time 'exactly' seem appropriate before, I explained further. "'For one thing I age attachment place gets deeply rooted, I think. As mere child one enjoys suffers like kitten hour hour. But one old enough form associations weave dreams, yet still child--it then, I fancy, home gets almost bound one's life.' "He simply said 'Yes,' I went on. Why, I hardly tell, except talk subject beyond mere current chit-chit, understood, luxury often taste tea-parties town. "'And yet I know theory hold good, even case,' I went on, 'for father quite much devoted place were, fell love quite early. But foreign name first attraction him, I think.' "'It abroad, then?' asked. "I explained, I hardly tell why, I went talking till I given nearly full history Reka Dom I given you. For one thing seemed amazingly interested recital, drew many particulars questions; song filled head tender memories, happy little details old times, always pleasant prose River Home, indeed, child, pleasant still. "We laughing childish reminiscence, Miss Martha tapped shoulder said rather louder usual-- "'Dear Mary, engravings here, love, I like look at.' "I felt rather astonished, I knew every book picture house well I knew own, I followed table, added, fluttering whisper-- "'You excuse interrupting you, love, I sure; becoming quite particular.' "I blushed redder crimson silk binding 'Keepsake' me. I wished I could honestly misunderstood Miss Martha's meaning. But I could not. Had I indeed talked much long gentleman stranger? (It startled reflect rapidly passed stage civil commonplace normal condition intercourse gentlemen town.) I certainly innocent intentional transgression bounds reticence decorum young lady's best friends, length conversation merchant I felt quite uncertain unspeakably alarmed. "I indulging hasty dismal reflections Miss Martha continued-- "'When I young, dear Mary, I remember valuable piece advice given excellent friend schoolmistress, Miss Peckham, "If slightly acquainted gentleman, talk indifferent matters. If wish friendly conspicuous, talk _his_ affairs; mean intimate, speak yourself;"' adding, 'I sure forgive me, love,' Miss Martha fluttered table. "At moment I feeling provoked myself, feel sure forgiveness professed be; one thing I felt perfectly certain. Nothing sheer necessity induce speak another syllable London merchant. "Circumstances altogether favour resolution. I scrupulously avoided much look Mr. Smith, though mysterious way I became conscious father long _tête-à-tête_ conversation corner. I devoted exclusively rector's wife till supper, I carefully chose opposite side table merchant seemed going. But I fairly seated, reason gave place someone else, impossible change seat, took one next it. It provoking, I steadily resisted attempts talk, kept face much averted possible. Once twice helped something table, I barely thanked him, never lifted eyes face. I could not, however, avoid seeing hand helped me, idly noticing ring I remarked before, playing. It fine blue stone, lapis lazuli, curiously artistically set. 'Rich merchants afford baubles!' I thought. It tasteful, however, look like English work. There something engraven upon it, look like English either. Was Greek? I glanced curiosity, reminded of--but nonsense, fancy came subject mind. At moment hand ring moved close I looked again. "It fancy. There mistaking inscription time. I learnt thoroughly--written often--loved well--it _Reka Dom_. "For moment I sat blind astonishment. Then truth suddenly flashed upon me. The merchant's name name predecessors Reka Dom. True, common one I met one family Smiths since without dreaming connection River House. And yet, course, Misses Brooke known him. Before time. Which could be? He young father, John among little Russians--unless, yes, English version one Russian names--and Ivan. "It crowned misfortunes. What would Miss Martha say knew subject conversation? Would excellent rule guide young ladyhood curtailed conversational propensities mine! I thought three degrees intimacy shudder. Why satisfied discussing merits song? "We gone talk homes, enough, proceeded mine. I got red I sat listening civil chat Mr. Ward curate (eminently innocent stage first degree), trying recall spoken connection Home beloved us, Ivan whose lilies I tended years. "I grew nearly frantic I thought must think I known was, wildly indignant fancy small mysteries kept Miss Brooke telling us going meet. "At last evening came end. I cloaking hall merchant came offered help, I declined. But go, stood I could help seeing distressed look eyes, nervous way turning blue ring upon finger. "'I wanted speak again,' said. 'I wanted say--' "But moment I caught Miss Martha's eye parlour doorway, and, dropping hasty curtsey, I ran father. "'A nice young fellow,' father observed, I took arm outside; 'a superior, sensible, well informed gentleman, meet every day.' "I felt quite unequal answering remark, went on: "'What funny little ways old friends have, dear, sure. Considering strangers come place, would natural tell us one asked us meet; known us, tenants Reka Dom, doubly natural speak us, us him. But told people present heard word. He seems fond appreciate little oddities. He told remembers, boy, never would call Ivan, much name man ever baptized. They thought might give tendency affectation bear singular name England. They always called John, keep discipline still. When arrived yesterday expressed highly satisfied general improvement him, said could hardly help laughing Miss Martha added, 'And seem quite shaken little habit affectation which--you excuse me, dear John--you boy.' He says that, best belief, approach affectation consisted rather absent ungainly, strong aversion Mr. Brooke.' "'Did old gentleman wear frightful shade time?' I asked. "'Not always,' says, 'but looked worse without it. He told good deal I never heard. He remembered hearing spoken boy. It appears brother wild extravagant youth; drank, too, I fancy, gave poor sisters world trouble, breaking heart widowed mother spoiled him. When died sisters lived together, never faltered efforts save him--never shut doors would return--and paid debts again. He spent fortune, theirs, besides means breaking comfortable marriages both. Mr. Smith thinks long illness checked career, eventually reformed.' "'I hope grateful poor sisters,' I said. "'One naturally thinks must so, Smith's remark just. He said, "I fancy penitent grateful far able, I believe long accustomed unqualified self-sacrifice feel sensitively!" And I believe right. Such men seldom reform conduct live long enough, eyes blinded years selfishness opened see clearly world.' "'It ought make one tender good ladies' little weaknesses,' I said, self-reproachfully; I walked home peaceful state mind. I forgave poor Miss Martha; also I secretly satisfied father found merchant's conversation attractive. It seemed give excuse breach Miss Peckham's golden rule. Moreover, little troubles offences seemed mountains Bellevue Cottage apt dwindle surmountable molehills larger-minded parents. I comparatively ease again. My father evidently seen nothing unusual conduct, I hoped conspicuous. Possibly I might never meet Mr. Smith more. I rather hoped not. Life long, world wide, sometimes possible lose sight people one disagreeable associations. And wholesome lesson future. "'And old gentleman like?' Fatima's first question, I came upstairs. I talking Mr. Brooke, old gentleman occurred memory moment. "'What old gentleman?' I asked dreamily. "'Miss Martha's old gentleman, merchant--was there, all?' "I blushed stupidity, certain feeling guiltiness connection person alluded to. "'Oh, yes, there,' I answered; 'but old gentleman.' "'What he, then?' Fatima asked, curiously. "It undoubtedly luxury bearer piece startling intelligence, well spoil enjoyment haste. I finished unsnapping necklace, said, deliberately-- "'He one little Russians.' "Fatima's wit jumped quickly mine done. It added-- "'Then Ivan.' * * * * * "My hopes reference Mr. Smith disappointed. I seen last him. My mother time home, I housekeeper absence. It morning following Bellevue tea-party father said me-- "'Mr. Smith coming refer book mine to-day, dear; I asked stay dinner. I suppose convenient?' "I said, 'Certainly, sir.' "I could plead domestic inconvenience; I thought Mr. Smith might gone quietly back London early coach, spared agitation prospect seeing undoubtedly excited. He came, however. It first visit, means last; lingered town, greatly father's satisfaction (who taken strong fancy him), not, apparently, Misses Brooke. "As I afterwards found clue somewhat strange conduct old friends time, I may well briefly state was. "When merchant first announced proposed business visit town, intention calling them, good ladies (in affection me, high opinion him) planned kindly little romance I hero heroine, end happy marriage. With view arranged meeting tea-party, avoided mention other, might meet (so speak) incidental way characteristic real love stories. With suspiciousness people general, young people particular, haunted Miss Martha, attributed ready acceptance invitation heard Mr. Smith's arrival, unusual attraction eligible gentleman tea-party. Little guess benevolent plans part I formed her, merchant's youthful appearance dashed ground. "It sometimes case, dear Ida, people make kind plans friends, become dissatisfied success arrangements cease good genii plot. If, is, matters seem likely fall wish, without assistance. It Misses Brooke, especially Miss Martha. Fully aware end mind proposed acquaintance, long conversation merchant struck indelicate readiness accept attentions matrimony perspective, designed gradual result sundry well-chaperoned studiously incidental interviews Cottage. And when, far thankfully accepting incidental meetings, merchant took upon become almost daily visitor house, delayed return London far beyond time proposed departure, good lady's view underwent decided change. It 'a pity' young man like John Smith neglect business. It also 'a pity' dear Mary's mother home. And I took occasion casually allude fact Mr. Smith's visits paid father, (with exception occasional meal) passed study amongst German pamphlets, statement met kind, incredulous smiles, supplemented general somewhat irritating observations proper line conduct young ladies certain crises life. Nothing could kinder Miss Martha's intentions, advice might still greater kindness would spoken straight-forwardly, believed I said. As was, I left going Bellevue Cottage, ardently wished merchant would go back merchandise, leave quiet little town dull peace. "Sometimes I thought full-grown man whose intelligent face, faintly foreign accent whose voice familiar home--the busy merchant, polite agreeable gentleman. And I thought Ivan I seemed known much better long ago! The pale boy wandering water--reading swing--dead river--buried beneath lilies. Oh! lived come back new form trouble me? "One day came father usual, I took opportunity call old friends. I felt ashamed neglected them, I knew Mr. Smith house, I could suspected hoped meet theirs. But I called unfortunate moment. Miss Martha made mind absence mother, absentness father, duty old friends like give little friendly counsel. As took great deal credit 'quite candid, dear,' quietly, persistently refused give credit virtue, I much irritated appreciate kindness led undertake task interference delicate matter; found remarks far palatable. In midst merchant announced. "If I could looked innocent would done good. As was, I believe I looked guilty. After sitting minutes longer I got go, horror merchant rose also. The old ladies made effort detain him, Miss Martha's face spoke volumes left house. Half mad vexation, I could hardly help asking stupid enough come away moment I chosen leaving; forestalled inquiry voluntary explanation. He wished speak me. He something say. "When said it, asked marry him, cup full. I refused vehemence must surprised him, modest was, rushed wildly home. "For next days I led life anything comfort. First Ivan. My impetuous refusal satisfy him, wrote letter I would bitter tears indescribable feeling. "Then father. The whole affair took surprise. He astonished, much put out, especially mother away. So far been, Misses Brooke, first thing occur him, repeatedly emphatically declared last thing expected. He could neither imagine made merchant think proposing me, made ready refuse him. Then middle crabbed pamphlet, Ivan's superior knowledge German invaluable. It inconvenient. "'Why I like poor Ivan?' "Ah, child, I like him! "'Then I cross him?' "Indeed, Ida, I think old ladies' 'ways' chiefly blame this. Their well-meant disastrous ways making feel wrong, wrong, matters straight-forward natural. But I safe wing mother, I saw Ivan again; and--many years I permitted spend together--I think I may truthfully say I never cross more. "'What say letter made cry?' "He asked allowed make better known me, I sent quite away. And developed ingenious notion father's brain, better opportunity could, every point view, found this, I allowed sit study whilst Ivan went German pamphlet. "The next call I paid Bellevue Cottage announce engagement, I doubt reception news might meet with. But I kinder loving congratulations two sisters. Small allusion made bygones. But Miss Martha murmured ear-- "'You forgive little fussiness over-anxiety, dear Mary. One would glad guard one's young friends difficulties disappointments one known oneself--' I thought past life sisters, returned kiss tenderness. Doubtless feared merchant might trifling feelings, thousand ills might happen little love affair longer careful management. But ending well, well; even Bellevue cats petted old ladies two brief sunny betrothal. "Sunny, although part winter time. When would sit fireside privileged idleness lovers, sometimes home, sometimes Cottage parlour; Ivan would tell Russian Reka Dom, winter beauties pleasures river months frozen highway, gay sleighs flying, jingling snow roads, peasants wrapped sheepskin crossing country market town. How dogs children rolled together snow dry intense cold hardly wet sand. And river closed, opened, local traditions connected events; stratagems resorted keep Jack Frost houses, stores laid siege Winter King. "But interesting narratives Fatima's hands never idle. She seemed concentrated love beautiful taper fingers, laboured ceaselessly exquisite needlework wedding clothes. "And lilies valley next blossom, Ivan I married. "The blue-stoned ring cut fit finger, was, desire, betrothal ring, I gave Ivan another instead it. Inside engraven inscription cut upon tombstone Reka Dom,-- "'TO IVAN.'" It long story, Nurse waiting little time old lady's kitchen came end. "And Ivan--?" Ida hesitatingly began. "Dead. Many years since, child," said little old lady; "you need afraid speak him, dear. All past. We used hope neither us long outlive other, God willed otherwise. It bitter first, different now. The days hours seemed widen separation fast bringing us together again." "Was papa's age died?" Ida gently asked. "He older father been, love, I think. He middle-aged man. He died fever. It London, delirium fancied river running windows, I bathed head believed cooling drops waters old home.' "Did know you?" Ida asked, sudden sympathy. "He knew touch hands always, dear. It greatest comfort. That, short time perfect reason sank rest. We married thirty years, I worn silver wedding-ring even pride golden one. There lilies grave true Ivan half time, be, perhaps, yet little while, till I also laid beneath them. "So ends story, dear," little old lady added, pause. "I like know became old landlord, please," Ida said. "If ask old woman like history people knew youth," said Mrs. Overtheway, smiling, "you must expect hear deaths. Of course dead many long year since. We became intimate whilst tenants, and, I believe, cheered close life. He father fast friends, mother became especially devoted.

But late life nephew became rich, habits parsimony second nature, seemed grown chronic exaggerated novel anxieties wealth. He still 'starved--and bought books.' During last years life consulted mother (and, I fancy, people also) merits various public charities place elsewhere; astonished death learn divided large part fortune amongst charitable institutions. With exception trifling legacies friends, rest money divided equal moderate bequests relatives. He left valuable books father, bulk library city born." "Was mother died?" Ida asked. "She was, dear.

The servant seemed relieved arrival, old gentleman altogether easy patient nurse. He laughed doctor, said, would touch drop medicine, otherwise patient sick gentleman could be, sat reading Bible day long. It bed mother found him, eyes dimming fast. He held hands mother, bent said something could catch three words--'the true riches.' He never spoke again." "Poor man?" said Ida: "I think nice. What became cat?" "Dead--dead--dead!" said little old lady; "Ida, child, I answer questions." "One more, please," said Ida! "where dear, dear Fatima?" "No, child, no! Nothing her. Dear, dear Fatima, indeed! And yet I tell married, husband (older even I am, deaf) living still. He I fond other, though, handsome man sensitive personal appearance, use trumpet, I consider weak. But get well. He smells flowers, smiles nods me, says something voice low I cannot hear it; I stick posy buttonhole, smile nod him, say something voice loud _he_ cannot hear it; go on. One day year always spend together, go church. The first November." "That is--?" said Ida. "The Feast All Saints, child." "Will tell more?" Ida asked. "No, dear. Not now, rate. Remember I old, outlived almost I loved youth. It right natural death sad eyes, child, I make tragedy story Reka Dom. * * * * * "Then real name," said Ida, gave old lady farewell kiss, "is--" "Mary Smith, dear," said Mrs. Overtheway. * * * * * Next morning little old lady went church usual, Ida window returned. When child seen old friend house still kept place, postman coming street, amusing watch door door, see large bundle letters delivered each. At Mrs. Overtheway's delivered one, big one, odd curiosity letter took possession Ida. She wished knew about, came, though, face it, likely would much wiser did. She still window door opposite house opened, little old lady came hurriedly out. She cap upon head, held open letter hand; _the_ letter, evident. When reached little green gate seemed recollect herself, and, putting hand head, went back house. Ida waited anxiously see would come again, presently appeared, time bonnet, still letter hand. She crossed street, seemed coming house. Then bell rang, came. Ida's curiosity became intense, lessened fact little old lady come her, stayed talking one. The old gentleman returned, must Nurse. At last conversation came end, Mrs. Overtheway came upstairs. She kissed Ida tenderly, inquired health; though seemed affectionate usual, Ida felt persuaded something matter. She drew chair fire, old lady sat down, saying-- "May I stay little you, dear?" "Oh, thank you?" said Ida, put footstool old lady's feet. Mrs. Overtheway stroked head tenderly time silence, said, gentle voice-- "I something tell you, dear." "Another story?" Ida asked. "Oh, thank you, another story." The old lady silent, last said, herself-- "Perhaps best so," added: "yes, love, I tell story." Ida thanked warmly, another pause ensued. "I hardly know begin, tell story," said little old lady last, seeming falter first time Scharazad-like powers narration. "Let Home, please; can," said Ida. "A home!" said old lady, strangely enough, seemed agitated spoken Reka Dom--"It begun broken home, shall not. It end united home, God willing. A home! I must begin far-away one, strange one, summit high cliffs, home fearless, powerful creatures, white-winged like angels." "It fairy tale," said Ida. "No, child, true." "It sounds like fairy tale," Ida said. "It shall tale description, like," said old lady, pause, "but, I said, main incidents true." "And white-winged creatures?" Ida asked. "Were fairies?" "No, love; birds. But see snowy albatrosses huge white wings wheeling circles vessel sailing mid ocean anything like I read heard described, fairyland could hardly show anything beautiful impressive." "Do fly near ships, then?" Ida asked. "Yes, child. I remember husband describing seen southern seas. He said saw them, great, white, majestic, holding intercourse anyone board ship, yet spreading wings day night hundreds miles ocean, folded feet, huge white pinions, except occasional flap, outstretched steady sail, never resting, seemingly never weary, looked like guardian angels keeping watch crew." "I wonder sorry ships go down?" said Ida, thoughtfully. Mrs. Overtheway took hand. "Do think unkind talk ships, love?" asked. "No, no, no!" Ida exclaimed, "I mind _your_ talking it. I wish I could talk birds saw papa's ship go down, any, ask was, minded much, remembered me. I used wish I him, one night I dreamed it; water touched me, I frightened, screamed, woke; I glad I there, perhaps would loved much seen I brave." The little old lady kissed tenderly. "And story, please," said Ida, pause. And Mrs. Overtheway began following story: KERGUELEN'S LAND. "'Down deep, freight crew, Past help lies, And never bale come shore Of thy merchandise. 'For cloth gold comely frieze,' Winstanley said, sigh'd, 'For velvet coif, costly coat, They fathoms deep may bide. 'O thou, brave skipper, blithe kind, O mariners bold true, Sorry heart, right sorry I, A-thinking you.'" "WINSTANLEY" (JEAN INGELOW). "Father Albatross day, come home island gives name story. He taken short flight, wife hatching egg, kept comparatively near island nest situated. There one egg, parental affection influenced numbers. There always love enough largest family, everything could desired child, Mother Albatross proud hen sitting dozen. "The Father Albatross considerate. Not deny long flights mate greatly enjoyed, generally contrived bring back shorter trips bits news amusement. Their island home lay far common track ships, sometimes sighted distant vessel, generally found something tell birds fish, whales waterspouts, icebergs storms. When news discussed winds waves, talk weather crops. "Bits news, like misfortunes, apt come together. The day egg hatched, Father Albatross returned morning flight full seen, hardly paid attention mate's announcement addition family. "'Could leave nest quarter hour, dear?' asked. "'Certainly not,' said Mother Albatross; 'as I told you, egg hatched last.' "'These things always happen least convenient moments,' said father bird. 'There ship within mere wing-stretch, untold miles course, going down. I came away sinking, might chance seeing her. It horrible sight.' "'It must terrible witness', replied, 'and I would give worlds see it; mother's first duty nest, quite impossible move. At time I beg return, see whatever seen.' "'It worth while,' answered; 'there moment lose, time must bottom belonging her.' "'Could none fly away?' Mother Albatross asked. "'No men wings,' replied mate, 'nor, matter, fins scales either. They curious creatures. The fancy wandering sea sky, Nature enabled support either, truly wonderful. Go ocean meet men, meet fish birds. Then anything disables ships contrive go in, go, men neither float fly, sink bottom like many stones.' "'Were many ship saw?' mother bird asked. "'More one likes see drowned batch,' said Father Albatross 'and I feel sorry captain. He fine fellow, bright eyes dark curly plumage, would handsome creature wings. He going giving orders desperate vain composure, wherever went went large dog dark bright curls like own. I seen ship before, I know dog. His name Carlo. He captain's property, ship's pet. Usually quiet, sometimes, blows, ill; commonly deck, blinking self-sufficient air imagine. However, to-day, moment danger imminent, seemed aware it, one idea subject, keep close master. He got front moved about, sat feet stood still, jumped shouted orders, licked hands seized ropes. In fact, troublesome. But expect creature requires four legs go with, cannot rise earth even these, move many yards day I go miles hour? He _can_ swim, certain length time. However, probably quiet enough now; perhaps lucky chance rolled master's feet sea.' "'Have men contrivance escaping occasions?' mother bird inquired. "'They boats, go ship hold longer. It much put little one fly storm wings failed.' "'Perhaps boats good order ship not,' said Mother Albatross, practical gift. 'Were boats one?' "'There were. I saw one lowered, quickly filled men, eager snatch last chance life. "'Was captain it?' asked. "'No. He stayed ship gave orders. The dog stayed him. Another boat lowered filled ship went down.' "'Was captain it?' "'Again, no. He stayed vessel others him. They sinking I came you. With last glance I gave I saw captain standing quite still near wheel. The dog sitting feet. They looking one direction--away sea. But distress yourself? It long since. Think little one, let us thankful belong superior race. We might born without wings, like poor sailors.' "'I cannot help grieving captain,' said Mother Albatross. 'When spoke bright eyes handsome plumage I thought you; I feel die? I wish gone boats.' "'I doubt would fared better,' said father bird. 'The second boat must swamped sinking ship; far probable get land.' "'Nevertheless, I hope fly direction to-morrow,' said, 'and bring word whether traces catastrophe.' "The following morning Father Albatross set desired. The ship foundered quite near side island, including little excursion see first boat still water, expected back shortly. "He returned even sooner Mother Albatross hoped, descended side nest much agitation majestic form capable displaying. "'Wonders never cease!' exclaimed. 'What think island?' "'I could guess I try till next hatching season,' said mate; 'and I beg keep suspense. I equal slightest trial nerves. It quite enough mother.' "'The captain one two men here,' said albatross. 'What think that? You able see yourself, show youngster men like bargain. It strange escaped; lazy, self-sufficient dog them.' "'I cannot possibly leave young one present,' said Mother Albatross, 'and certainly cannot get far. It provoking men leave island I see them.' "'There much fear that,' mate answered. 'A lucky wave brought shore, take good many lucky waves bring ship carry home.' "Father Albatross right; mate saw strangers sooner expected. Her nest, though built ground, highest point island, shipwrecked men soon made way; Mother Albatross ample chance seeing bright eyes captain scanned horizon line keen anxiety. Presently fell upon bird herself. "'What splendid creatures are!' said companion; 'and grandly fearless. I never one islands breed before. What pity cannot understand one! That fellow there, stretching noble wings, might take message bring us help.' "'He fine creature,' said Mother Albatross, peeping captain nest; 'that is, would wings, could speak properly, instead making unmusical jabbering like monkey.' "'I would give good deal one report first boat,' captain went on. 'Heaven knows I would content die I could know safe. But I afraid--I afraid; oh! dear!' "And captain paced down, consoling him. "'He seem tame one might expect,' said Mother Albatross, 'he restless. But possibly hungry.' "Truly great amusement mother bird watch strangers nest, question mate peculiarities. "'What now?' asked one occasion, captain reading paper taken note-book pocket. "'That letter,' said Father Albatross. 'And look I gather that, like ourselves, got young one somewhere, wherever nest may be.' "'How gather that?' mate inquired. "'Because writing large,' answered Father Albatross. 'It one peculiarities creatures smaller larger write. That letter young one; probably own.' "'Very remarkable indeed,' said Mother Albatross. 'And _now_?' "'Now writing himself,' said mate; 'and observe see statement confirmed. See much smaller writes!' "The captain indeed torn sheet note-book, busy scribbling upon knees. Whether sight papers familiar memory Carlo, whether merely moved one doggish impulses little understand, impossible say; captain began write, Carlo began wag tail, wagged without pause weariness till captain finished, keeping nearest eye half open, fixed upon paper captain's moving hand. Once sat haunches put nose letter. "'That right, old fellow, kiss it,' said captain. 'I telling you. Heaven send may ever read it, poor child!' "At Carlo became frantic, persistent pushing nose paper, captain fain pocket writing materials, game play 'ship's dog,' latter condescendingly joined minutes, lay before, shutting eyes air seemed imply-- "'I see, poor fellow, understand me.' "The hardships endured small remnant ship's company great. They managed live. The weather fine, first trouble permanent shelter. Perhaps, too, spite seaman's knowledge position in, dim hope ship course been, picking off, buoyed fancy 'it worth while.' But ship appeared; built hut near albatross's nest, began talk seasons, provision future. They kept look-out turns daylight, night moon stars made distance visible. Every morning sun rising sea met captain's keen eyes scanning horizon, every evening closed day's fruitless watch, sun's going saw captain's brown hands clasped together said, 'God's done!' "So days became weeks, weeks ripened months, Carlo became used new home, happy it, kept watch master, took ease usual. But men's appearance changed, clothes began look shabby. In first place wearing out, and, secondly, seemed--as say--to 'getting large' them, hang loosely untidily upon gaunt frames. The captain's eyes looked larger sadder, voice grew hollow sunset, threads white began show among dark curls, increased number day day. "'His plumage white soon,' said Mother Albatross. 'I suppose climate it.' "'He getting older,' said mate; 'men, like ourselves, get white get old.' "'But short time,' said Mother Albatross. "'He much older, however,' said father bird, mate said more; knew tone voice got end available information subject, beyond point like pressed. "'It hard, hard, captain, I cannot submit do,' said one men one day. He captain sitting side side look out, elbows knees, chins upon hands. "'And yet harder you,' said captain. 'One must die day. It that. And single man, Barker, without ties.' "The man stooped down, taking one Carlo's long ears hand, played absently it, said-- "'No, sir. I married, true, children. I feel you, sir, heart. But little house Plymouth, that, God knows, I see moment clearly I see you, girl either forgotten me, breaking good heart ever beat woman's breast man husband, fast bound upon rock sea-birds. The Lord knows best, captain, comes hard. We troubles, sir.' "The captain laid hand upon shoulder. "'Forgive me,' said. 'God comfort you! God bless you!' And, rising hurriedly, went forward, big tears breaking cheeks, sea sky dancing together eyes. "'What dream night, Barker?' said captain, another day. "'Home, sir,' said Barker. "'Strange!' said captain. 'So I. In time here, I never dreamed island, day's work, even seeing sail. I dream England night night.' "'It myself, sir,' said Barker. 'I Plymouth half time, I may say. And I dream father's old home Surrey.' "'Are men going change feathers, think?' Mother Albatross inquired mate. 'They wretched appearance. Only dog looks like himself.' (The first excitement pity curiosity subsided, good couple naturally inclined critical.) "'I detest dog,' said Father Albatross. 'His idleness arrogance make quite sick. I think I want exercise, too, I mean good flight to-day;' and, spreading broad wings, bird sailed away. "His excursion quite dispel irritability. When returned, settled captain, sitting listlessly, usual, Carlo feet. "'If would exert yourself,' began Father Albatross, 'something might come it. You getting bad dog. Spread arms yours, see them! If could fly matter miles, would see sail--and reason expect.' "'What matter birds to-day?' said captain, rather irritable mood himself. 'They silent enough generally'--for voice albatross rarely heard sea. "'Move arms, I tell you,' croaked albatross. 'Up down--so!--and follow me.' "'I shall dog going next,' muttered captain. 'Come along, Carlo.' And turning back Father Albatross, moved away. "'He understand you,' said Mother Albatross, endeavoured, proper, soothe mate's irritability, make peace. 'Could take message ship yourself? It nothing magnificent wings, fault, poor creature, formed like you.' "'You speak sensibly, dear' said Father Albatross; took flight sea. "But returned even worse mood before. "'Nothing equal stupidity human beings,' observed. 'I addressed captain. "There island shipwrecked men miles north-east," said I. "We shall see land ten days, madam," says captain lady deck. "There big fool wrecked island north-east north," I cried. "If skill sparrow could see eyes five minutes." "It remarkable," said captain, "I never heard one albatross make sound before." "And never again," said I; "it waste time talk you. It take long put water like rest." And away I came.' "'I understand cry human beings myself,' said mate, 'and I rather glad I not; would irritate me. Perhaps understand you.' "'They stupid alike,' said father bird; 'but I done best, shall disturb more.' "The captain watched till sunset, folded hands, bent head usual, last lay sleep. He dreamt England, home--of home long since, young wife, dead years ago. He dreamt lay, early morning, sunny room little cottage lived, where, summer, morning sun awoke much later birds. He dreamt wife him, thought asleep, that, thinking, put arms round neck awaken him--that lay still, pretended slumbering on, that, lying, saw face bright unearthly beauty, eyes fixed intensity expression held like spell. Then felt warm face come nearer his, kissed cheeks, heard say, 'Wake up, darling, I something show you.' Again repeated vehemently, 'Awake! Awake! Look! Look!' opened eyes. "He lying look-out, Carlo licking face. It dream, yet voice strong clear ears, 'Awake! Awake! Look! Look!' "A heavier hand wife's shoulder, Barker's rough voice (hoarser usual), repeated words dream. "The captain's eyes followed outstretched hand horizon; voice grew hoarse, exclaimed-- "'My God! sail!'" * * * * * Ida leaning little old lady's footstool now. She sat upright, pale face whiter not. "_Did_ ship take away?" asked eagerly. "Yes, dear. Their signals seen, ship took home friends, believed dead." "Do people drowned--I mean thought drowned--ever come home _really_?" child asked. "Yes, really. Ida, dear, I want remember that, regards captain crew, true story." Ida clasped hands passionately together. "Oh, Mrs. Overtheway! Do think Papa ever come home?" "My child! dear child!" sobbed little old lady. "I think will." ... * * * * * "And _is_ alive--he coming home!" Ida cried, recounted Mrs. Overtheway's story Nurse, knew principal fact already. "And told way frighten me. I cry laugh though, silly; said I must foolish, brave like captain's daughter, I ought thank GOD good me, children poor men died never fathers back world: I thankful, thankful! Only like mill going head, I cannot help crying. And Papa wrote long letter island, sent Mrs. Overtheway Uncle Garbett told I fond her, would tell nicely, read it, give told me. And lovely letter, island, poor Barker, dear old Carlo, beautiful birds, too, Mrs. Overtheway made great deal herself. And please, Nursey, take black frock never let see again, Captain really coming home, and, oh! I wish would come!" The poor child terribly excited, habits obedience stood good stead, though vehemently certain could possibly go sleep, compliance Nurse's wishes, went bed, last slept heavily long; awoke time dress ready meet father. She putting treasures look at, carved fans workboxes, beads handkerchiefs feathers, new letter old one--when Captain came. * * * * * A week postman delivered letter contained wonderful news Ida, brought another Mrs. Overtheway's green gate, addressed handwriting--the Captain's. It Captain, however, Ida. "MY DEAR, DEAR MRS. OVERTHEWAY, "We got Saturday night, happy. Papa says come see us? I got little room myself, I got glass case I keep things Papa ever sent me, letters. I bought part sovereign Uncle Garbett gave I came away. Do know kind I came away. He kissed me, said, 'GOD bless you, dear! You good child, good child;' know kind him, I think I ever good somehow him. But kind made cry, I could say anything, I gave great many kisses, I want know I love Papa best. Carlo put nose knee, I cannot help making blots. He came us railway carriage, ate nearly sandwiches. When Papa roll hearthrug together, I mix curls pretend I cannot tell which. Only really Papa's got grey hairs them: _we know why_. I always kiss white hairs I find them, says thinks I shall kiss colour again. He kind! I said I like Nurse wear black dress now, said best one had, must wear afternoon; Papa said would get us bright things, says English people dress mud-colour, people live much sunnier, brighter countries wear gay clothes. So went shop morning, I asked get things blue, favourite colour. But said choose Nurse's things himself. So asked smart dress, man asked kind; I said nurse, brought lot prints, last Papa chose one yellow ground carnations it. He wanted much got another one big flowers, man said meant curtains, dresses, I persuaded get it; says wishes had, much best. Then got red shawl, bonnet ribbon kind green tartan. Nurse much pleased, said smart half. But Papa told knew better, never seen parrots East Indian Islands. Yesterday went church. Carlo came too, got porch, Papa put hand, said, 'Prayers, sir!' Carlo lay stayed till came out. Papa says used going say prayers board ship, Carlo always lay quietly deck till service over. Before went church Papa gave little parcel sealed up, put plate. I asked was, said thankoffering. Before one prayers clergyman said something. I quite remember words, began, 'A sailor desires thank GOD--' oh! I _knew_ was, I squeezed hand tight, I tried pray every word prayer, I began think island--but I _did_ try! And indeed I try very, thankful, I happy! Papa got letter Barker morning, going choose wedding present. He sent photograph girl going marry, I rather disappointed, I thought would lovely, only, perhaps, rather sad-looking; look pretty, sitting rather vulgar dress, photograph book hand. Her dress tartan, queer-looking waist, know, like Nurse's, coloured picture, brooch gilt. Papa laughs, says Barker likes colour, does; says thinks nice face, knows good, fond Barker, Barker thinks beautiful. He write went see her, like Papa. He walked house, found sitting window photograph hand. She said restless day, could nothing sit look it. Was funny? She ill thinking dead, Barker says nearly died joy seeing again. Papa sends love, I send lots lots mine, millions kisses. And please, _please_ come see us can, I miss every morning, I love you, always grateful affectionate "IDA." "P.S.--I telling Papa stories bits. And know went sleep whilst I telling Mrs. Moss!" Chim! chime! chim! chime! chim! chime! The story ended, bells still call Morning Prayer, life goes on. The little old lady comes green gate, looks way, face window now; something made start instant, looking-glass, smart toilette-table brought back window Ida used kneel, nursery spare bedroom more. That episode dull house quiet street over, gone by. The old lady thinks rather sadly goes bells calling. The pale, eager, loving little face turned loneliness, brightens happy home; remembrance little old lady still, pleasant remembrance flowers winter come.
