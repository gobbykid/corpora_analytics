 THE CUCKOO CLOCK I THE OLD HOUSE "Somewhat back village streetStands old-fashioned country seat." Once upon time old town, old street, stood veryold house. Such house could hardly find nowadays, however yousearched, belonged gone-by time--a time quite passedaway. It stood street, yet like town house, thoughthe front opened right pavement, back windows looked outupon beautiful, quaintly terraced garden, old trees growing sothick close together summer like living edgeof forest near them; even winter web theirinterlaced branches hid clear view behind. There colony rooks old garden. Year year theyheld parliaments cawed chattered fussed; year afteryear built nests hatched eggs; year year, I_suppose_, old ones gradually died young ones took theirplace, though, knowing _must_ so, one would havesuspected it, appearance rooks always same--everand always same. Time indeed seemed stand still old house, ifit people inhabited got _so_ old could notget older, outlived possibility change. But one day last come change. Late dusk anautumn afternoon carriage drove door old house, camerattling stones sudden noisy clatter sounded quiteimpertinent, startling rooks composing themselvesto rest, setting wondering could matter. A little girl matter! A little girl grey merino frock, andgrey beaver bonnet, grey tippet grey gloves--all grey together, evento eyes, except round rosy face bright brown hair. Hername even rather grey, Griselda. A gentleman lifted carriage disappeared intothe house, later evening gentleman came thehouse got carriage come back again, anddrove away. That rooks saw change cometo old house. Shall go inside see more? Up shallow, wide, old-fashioned staircase, past wainscotedwalls, dark shining like mirror, long narrow passage withmany doors, gleaming brass handles one would nothave known there, oldest three old servants led littleGriselda, tired sleepy supper left almostuntasted, room prepared her. It queer room, foreverything house queer; dancing light fireburning brightly tiled grate, looked cheerful enough. "I glad fire," said child. "Will keep alight tillthe morning, think?" The old servant shook head. "'Twould safe leave would burn till morning,"she said. "When bed asleep, little missie, wantthe fire. Bed's warmest place." "It I want it," said Griselda; "it light I likeit. This house looks dark me, yet seem lightshidden walls too, shine so." The old servant smiled. "It seem strange you, doubt," said; "but getto like it, missie. It Is _good_ old house, know bestlove well." "Whom mean?" said Griselda. "Do mean great-aunts?" "Ah, yes, others beside," replied old woman. "The rooks love itwell, others beside. Did ever hear tell 'good people,'missie, sea come from?" "Fairies, mean?" cried Griselda, eyes sparkling. "Of courseI've _heard_ them, I never saw any. Did ever?" "I could say," answered old woman. "My mind young likeyours, missie, times strange memories come back meas sights sounds dream. I old see hear Ionce could. We old here, missie. It Was time something young cameto old house again." "How strange queer everything seems!" thought Griselda, gotinto bed. "I feel I belonged bit. And all_so_ old; perhaps like child among them?" The thought occurred rooks! They could notdecide fors againsts all, settled put tothe vote next morning, meantime Griselda allwent sleep. I never heard _they_ slept well night; unusualexcitement hardly expected would. But Griselda, beinga little girl rook, tired two minutes shehad tucked bed quite sound asleep, notwake several hours. "I wonder look like morning," lastwaking thought. "If summer now, spring, I shouldn'tmind--there would always something nice then." As sometimes happens, woke again, early morning,long light, thoughts went straight samesubject. "If summer now, spring," repeated herself, ifshe asleep all--like man fell trance fora hundred years saying "it bitt--" woke upagain finished sentence nothing happened--"erly cold." "Ifonly spring," thought Griselda. Just got far thoughts, gave great start. Whatwas heard? Could wish come true? Was fairylandindeed got to, one needs _wish_, to_be_? She rubbed eyes, dark see; _that_ notvery fairyland like, ears felt certain deceived her:she quite, quite sure heard cuckoo! She listened might, hear again. Couldit, all, fancy? She grew sleepy last, justdropping when--yes, again, clear distinct aspossible--"Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!" three, four, _five_ times, thenperfect silence before. "What funny cuckoo," said Griselda herself. "I could almost fancyit house. I wonder great-aunts tame cuckoo acage? I _think_ I ever heard thing, aqueer house; everything seems different it--perhaps tamecuckoo. I ask morning. It nice hear, whateverit is." And, pleasant feeling companionship, sense notthe living creature awake dark world, Griselda laylistening, contentedly enough, sweet, fresh notes thecuckoo's friendly greeting. But sounded thesilent house fast asleep. And time slepttill daylight found way _very_ darkest nooksand crannies ancient dwelling. She dressed carefully, warned auntsloved neatness precision; fastened button greyfrock, tied hair smooth brown tangle _could_be tied down; and, absorbed weighty cares, forgot allabout cuckoo time. It till sitting atbreakfast aunts remembered it, rather remindedof it, little remark made friendly robins onthe terrace walk outside. "Oh, aunt," exclaimed, stopping short half-way journey hermouth spoonful bread milk, "have got cuckoo acage?" "A cuckoo cage," repeated elder aunt, Miss Grizzel; "what isthe child talking about?" "In cage!" echoed Miss Tabitha, "a cuckoo cage!" "There cuckoo somewhere house," said Griselda; "I heard itin night. It could out-of-doors, could it? It would betoo cold." The aunts looked little smile. "So like hergrandmother," whispered. Then said Miss Grizzel-- "We cuckoo, dear, though cage, isn'texactly sort cuckoo thinking of. It lives clock." "In clock," repeated Miss Tabitha, confirm sister'sstatement. "In clock!" exclaimed Griselda, opening grey eyes wide. It sounded something like three bears, speaking one theother, Griselda's voice like Tiny's; loudest ofthe three. "In clock!" exclaimed; "but cannot alive, then?" "Why not?" said Miss Grizzel. "I know," replied Griselda, looking puzzled. "I knew little girl once," pursued Miss Grizzel, "who quite ofopinion cuckoo _was_ alive, nothing would persuaded itwas not. Finish breakfast, dear, like shallcome see cuckoo yourself." "Thank you, Aunt Grizzel," said Griselda, going bread andmilk. "Yes," said Miss Tabitha, "you shall see cuckoo yourself." "Thank you, Aunt Tabitha," said Griselda. It rather bother havealways say "thank you," "no, thank you," twice, Griseldathought polite so, Aunt Tabitha always repeatedeverything Aunt Grizzel said. It would mattered much ifAunt Tabitha said _at once_ Miss Grizzel, shegenerally made little pause between, sometimes rather awkward.But course better say "thank you" "no, thank you" twiceover hurt Aunt Tabitha's feelings. After breakfast Aunt Grizzel good word. She took Griseldathrough several rooms house, pointing thecuriosities, telling histories rooms theircontents; Griselda liked listen, every room came to,she wondered _when_ would get room lived cuckoo. Aunt Tabitha come them, rather rheumatic. Onthe whole, Griselda sorry. It would taken _very_long time, see, histories twice over, andpossibly, Griselda got tired, might forgotten the"thank you's" "no, thank you's" twice over. The old house looked quite queer quaint daylight hadseemed evening before; almost indeed, view thewindows added sweet, odd "old-fashionedness" everything. "We beautiful roses summer," observed Miss Grizzel, catchingsight direction child's eyes wandering. "I wish summer. I love summer," said Griselda. "But avery rosy scent rooms even now, Aunt Grizzel, though iswinter, nearly winter." Miss Grizzel looked pleased. "My pot-pourri," explained. They standing called "great saloon," ahandsome old room, furnished gold-and-white chairs, must oncehave brilliant, faded yellow damask hangings. A feeling awehad crept Griselda entered ancient drawing-room. Whatgrand parties must long ago! But dancing init _now_--dancing, laughing, chattering--such thing quiteimpossible imagine! Miss Grizzel crossed room stood one corner marvellousChinese cabinet, black gold carving. It made theshape temple, palace--Griselda sure which. Any way, itwas delicious wonderful. At door stood, one side,two solemn mandarins; or, speak correctly, perhaps I say,a mandarin wife, right-hand figure evidentlyintended lady. Miss Grizzel gently touched heads. Forthwith, Griselda'sastonishment, began solemnly nod. "Oh, make that, Aunt Grizzel?" exclaimed. "Never mind, dear; would _you_ try make themnod. They would like it," replied Miss Grizzel mysteriously. "Respectto elders, dear, always remember that. The mandarins _many_years older you--older I myself, fact." Griselda wondered, so, Miss Grizzel tooksuch liberties herself, said nothing. "Here last summer's pot-pourri," continued Miss Grizzel, touchinga great china jar little stand, close beside cabinet. "You maysmell it, dear." Nothing loth, Griselda buried round little nose fragrantleaves. "It lovely," said. "May I smell whenever I like, Aunt Grizzel?" "We shall see," replied aunt. "It _every_ little girl, youknow, could trust come great saloon alone." "No," said Griselda meekly. Miss Grizzel led way door opposite hadentered. She opened passed through, Griselda following, asmall ante-room. "It stroke ten," said Miss Grizzel, consulting watch;"now, dear, shall make acquaintance cuckoo." The cuckoo "that lived clock!" Griselda gazed round eagerly.Where clock? She could see nothing least like one, onlyup wall one corner looked like miniature house, ofdark brown carved wood. It _very_ like house, itcertainly roof--a roof deep projecting eaves; and, lookingcloser, yes, _was_ clock, all, figures, hadonce gilt, grown dim age, like everything else, thehands little distance hardly distinguished theface. Miss Grizzel stood perfectly still, looking clock; Griseldabeside her, breathless expectation. Presently came sort ofdistant rumbling. _Something_ going happen. Suddenly two littledoors clock face, Griselda known there,sprang open burst flew cuckoo, flapped wings, anduttered pretty cry, "Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!" Miss Grizzel countedaloud, "Seven, eight, nine, ten." "Yes, never makes mistake," sheadded triumphantly. "All long years I never known wrong.There clocks made nowadays, I assure you, dear." "But _is_ clock? Is alive?" exclaimed Griselda. "He looked atme nodded head, flapped wings went hishouse again--he indeed, aunt," said earnestly; "just likesaying, 'How do?' me." Again Miss Grizzel smiled, odd yet pleased smile Griseldahad seen face breakfast. "Just Sybilla used say," shemurmured. "Well, dear," added aloud, "it quite right he_should_ say, 'How do?' you. It first time seen_you_, though many year ago knew dear grandmother, yourfather, too, little boy. You find good friend,and one teach many lessons." "What, Aunt Grizzel?" inquired Griselda, looking puzzled. "Punctuality, one thing, faithful discharge duty," repliedMiss Grizzel. "May I come see cuckoo--to watch coming out, sometimes?"asked Griselda, felt could spend day looking theclock, watching little friend's appearance. "You see several times day," said aunt, "for inthis little room I intend prepare tasks. It nice andquiet, nothing disturb you, close room AuntTabitha I usually sit." So saying, Miss Grizzel opened second door little ante-room,and, Griselda's surprise, foot short flight stairsthrough another door, half open, caught sight Aunt Tabitha,knitting quietly fire, room breakfasted. "What _very_ funny house is, Aunt Grizzel," said, shefollowed aunt steps. "Every room many doors, youcome back think ever far off.I shall never able find way about." "Oh yes, will, dear, soon," said aunt encouragingly. "She kind," thought Griselda; "but I wish would call mylessons tasks. It makes sound dreadfully hard. But, way, I'mglad I room dear cuckoo lives." II _IM_PATIENT GRISELDA "... fairies seldom appear;If wrong must expectThat cost us dear!" It well days. Griselda found plenty amuseherself novelty lasted, enough prevent missing_very_ badly home left "over sea," troop ofnoisy merry brothers teased petted her. Of course _missed_them, "dreadfully." She neither homesick "dull." It quite smooth sailing lessons began. She notdislike lessons; fact, always thought rather fond ofthem. But alone lively, teacherswere strict. The worst writing arithmeticmaster, funny little old man wore knee-breeches took snuff,and called aunt "Madame," bowing formally whenever addressed her.He screwed Griselda unnatural attitude write hercopies, really felt would never come straight andloose again; arithmetic part instructions even worse.Oh! sums addition gave her! Griselda never partialto sums, rather easy-going governess home not, tellthe truth, partial either. And Mr.--I cannot remember thelittle old gentleman's name. Suppose call Mr. Kneebreeches--Mr.Kneebreeches, found out, conscientiously put back tothe beginning. It dreadful, really. He came twice week, days didn'tcome bad did, left whole _row_, I wasgoing say, could call Mr. Kneebreeches' addition sums"rows," far fat wide across spoken of!--wholeslatefuls terrible mountains figures climb wearily thetop of. And climb _once_ merely. _The_ terrible thing Mr.Kneebreeches' favourite method called "proving." I can'texplain it--it far beyond poor powers--but something dowith cutting top line, added hadactually done sum, understand--cutting top line andadding long rows without it, joining againsomewhere else. "I would mind much," said poor Griselda, one day, "if anygood. But see, Aunt Grizzel, not. For I likely dothe _proving_ wrong sum itself--more likely, I always sotired I get proving--and proved that_something's_ wrong, I sure good, except make mecross." "Hush!" said aunt gravely. "That way little girl tospeak. Improve golden hours youth, Griselda; neverreturn." "I hope not," muttered Griselda, "if means sums." Miss Grizzel fortunately little deaf; hear thisremark. Just cuckoo clock struck eleven. "Good little cuckoo," said Miss Grizzel. "What example sets you.His life spent faithful discharge duty;" saying sheleft room. The cuckoo still telling hour--eleven took good while. Itseemed Griselda bird repeated aunt's last words."Faith--ful, dis--charge, of--your, du--ty," said, "faith--ful." "You horrid little creature!" exclaimed Griselda passion; "whatbusiness mock me?" She seized book, first came hand, flung birdwho beginning eleventh cuckoo. He disappeared snap,disappeared without flapping wings, or, Griselda always fanciedhe did, giving friendly nod, instant silent. Griselda felt little frightened. What done? She looked atthe clock. It seemed usual, cuckoo's doors closelyshut, sign disturbance. Could fancy thathe sprung back hastily would done herthrowing book him? She began hope so, tried go withher lessons. But use. Though really gave bestattention long addition sums, found shemanaged much better before, could feel happy atease. Every minutes glanced clock, expectingthe cuckoo come out, though knew quite well chanceof till twelve clock, hours, thehalf hours quarters, told. "I wish twelve clock," said anxiously thanonce. If clock high wall, wouldhave tempted climb open little doors, peep tosatisfy cuckoo's condition. But nopossibility this. The clock far, far reach, andthere high piece furniture standing near, upon couldhave climbed get it. There nothing done wait fortwelve clock. And, all, wait twelve clock, abouthalf-past eleven, Miss Grizzel's voice heard calling puton hat cloak quickly, come walk theterrace her. "It fine now," said Miss Grizzel, "but prospect ofrain long. You must leave lessons present, andfinish afternoon." "I finished them," said Griselda, meekly. "_All?_" inquired aunt. "Yes, all," replied Griselda. "Ah, well, then, afternoon, rain holds off, shall driveto Merrybrow Hall, inquire health dear godmother,Lady Lavander," said Miss Grizzel. Poor Griselda! There things disliked drive withher aunts. They went old yellow chariot, windows up,and course Griselda sit back horses, whichmade uncomfortable air, sit stillfor long. Merrybrow Hall large house, quite old much grander, notnearly wonderful home Griselda's aunts. It six milesoff, took long time indeed drive rumblingold chariot, old horses fat wheezy, oldcoachman fat wheezy too. Lady Lavander was, course, old too--veryold indeed, rather grumpy deaf. Miss Grizzel MissTabitha greatest respect her; always called "Mydear," quite girls, listened said asif words gold. For mysterious reason beeninvited Griselda's godmother; but, never shown anyproof affection beyond giving prayer-book, hoping, whenevershe saw her, "a good little miss," Griselda feelany particular gratitude her. The drive seemed longer duller ever afternoon, butGriselda bore meekly; Lady Lavander, usual, expressed herhopes her, little girl looked modestly, feeling hercheeks grow scarlet. "I good little girl all," feltinclined call out. "I bad cruel. I believe I killed thedear little cuckoo." What _would_ three old ladies thought called out?As was, Lady Lavander patted approvingly, said loved seeyoung people modest humble-minded, gave slice veryhighly-spiced, rather musty gingerbread, Griselda could bear. All way home Griselda felt fever impatience rush tothe ante-room see cuckoo right again. It late anddark chariot last stopped door old house. MissGrizzel got slowly, still slowly Miss Tabitha followed her.Griselda obliged restrain move demurely. "It past supper-time, dear," said Miss Grizzel. "Go atonce room, Dorcas shall bring supper you. Late hoursare bad young people." Griselda obediently wished aunts good-night, went quietlyupstairs. But sight, first landing, changed herpace. She turned left instead right, led herown room, flew rather ran along dimly-lighted passage, atthe end door led great saloon. She opened door.All quite dark. It impossible fly run across greatsaloon! Even daylight would difficult matter.Griselda _felt_ way best could, past Chinese cabinet andthe pot-pourri jar till got ante-room door. It open, andnow, knowing way better, hurried in. But use? Allwas silent, save tick-tick cuckoo clock corner. Oh, if_only_ cuckoo would come call hour usual, aweight would lifted Griselda's heart! She idea clock was. It might close hour, orit might past it. She stood listening minutes, thenhearing Miss Grizzel's voice distance, felt darednot stay longer, turned feel way room again.Just got door seemed something softlybrushed cheek, very, faint "cuckoo" sounded, were,in air close her. Startled, frightened, Griselda stood perfectly still. "Cuckoo," said, softly. But answer. Again tones Miss Grizzel's voice coming upstairs reached ear. "I _must_ go," said Griselda; finding way across saloonwithout, great good luck, tumbling many breakabletreasures filled, flew long passageagain, reaching room Dorcas appeared hersupper. Griselda slept badly night. She constantly dreaming thecuckoo, fancying heard voice, waking start tofind _only_ fancy. She looked pale heavy-eyed camedown breakfast next morning; Aunt Tabitha, alonein room entered, began immediately asking thematter. "I sure going ill, child," said, nervously. "SisterGrizzel must give medicine. I wonder would best.Tansy tea excellent thing one taken cold, or----" But rest Miss Tabitha's sentence never heard, thismoment Miss Grizzel came hurriedly room--her cap awry, hershawl disarranged, face pale. I hardly think one everseen discomposed before. "Sister Tabitha!" exclaimed, "what going happen? Thecuckoo clock stopped." "The cuckoo clock stopped!" repeated Miss Tabitha, holding herhands; "_im_possible!" "But has, rather I say--dear me, I upset I cannotexplain myself--the _cuckoo_ stopped. The clock going on, thecuckoo told hours, Dorcas opinion left offdoing yesterday. What going happen? What shall do?" "What do?" said Miss Tabitha. "Should send thewatch-maker?" Miss Grizzel shook head. "'Twould worse useless. Were search world over, wecould find one put right. Fifty years more, Tabitha, fiftyyears more, never missed hour! We getting old,Tabitha, day nearly over; perhaps remind us this." Miss Tabitha reply. She weeping silently. The old ladiesseemed forgotten presence niece, Griselda couldnot bear see distress. She finished breakfast quickly asshe could, left room. On way upstairs met Dorcas. "Have heard happened, little missie?" said old servant. "Yes," replied Griselda. "My ladies great trouble," continued Dorcas, seemed inclinedto communicative usual, "and wonder. For fifty yearsthat clock never gone wrong." "Cannot put right?" asked child. Dorcas shook head. "No good would come interfering," said. "What must be, must be.The luck house hangs clock. Its maker spent good partof life it, last words would bring goodluck house owned it, trouble would follow itssilence. It belief," added solemnly, "that _fairy_clock, neither less, good luck brought nodenying. There cows like ours, missie--their milk proverbhereabouts; hens like laying year round;there roses like ours. And always friendly feeling inthis house, always been. It Is house wrangling andjangling, sharp words. The 'good people' cannot stand that. Nothingdrives away like ill-temper anger." Griselda's conscience gave sharp prick. Could _her_ doingthat trouble coming upon old house? What punishment amoment's fit ill-temper. "I wish would talk way, Dorcas," said; "it makes sounhappy." "What feeling heart child has!" said old servant wenton way downstairs. "It true--she like Miss Sybilla." That day weary sad one Griselda. She oppressed bya feeling understand. She knew done wrong, shehad sorely repented it, "I think cuckoo might come backagain," said herself, "if _is_ fairy; not, itcan't true Dorcas says." Her aunts made allusion subject presence, almostseemed forgotten known distress. They weremore grave silent usual, otherwise things went theirordinary way. Griselda spent morning "at tasks," theante-room, thankful get away tick-tick clockin corner garden. But there, alas! bad. The rooks seemed know thatsomething matter; set work making chatterimmediately Griselda appeared felt inclined run back intothe house again. "I sure talking me," said herself. "Perhapsthey fairies too. I beginning think I like fairies." She glad bed-time came. It sort reproach seeher aunts pale troubled; though tried persuade herselfthat thought silly, could throw theuncomfortable feeling. She tired went bed--tired disagreeable waythat comes listless, uneasy day--that fell asleep andslept heavily. When woke, suddenly, start,it still perfectly dark, like first morning wakenedin old house. It seemed wakened ofherself--something roused her. Yes! again, very,_very_ soft distant "cuckoo." _Was_ distant? She could tell.Almost could fancied close her. "If cuckoo come back again, I catch him!" exclaimedGriselda. She darted bed, felt way door, closed, andopening let rush moonlight unshuttered passagewindow. In another moment little bare feet pattering along thepassage full speed, direction great saloon. For Griselda's childhood among troop noisy brothers taughther one lesson--she afraid nothing. Or rather perhaps I shouldsay never learnt anything afraid of! And isthere? III OBEYING ORDERS "Little girl, thou must thy part fulfil,If take kindly ours:Then pull weeds will,And fairies cherish flowers." There moonlight, though much, saloon theante-room, too; though windows, like Griselda'sbed-room, shutters closed, round part top,high up, shutters reach to, crept, throughthese clear uncovered panes, quite many moonbeams, may sure,as could find way. Griselda, eager though was, could help standing still momentto admire effect. "It looks prettier light coming holes topthan even shutters open," said herself. "Howgoldy-silvery cabinet looks; and, yes, I declare, mandarinsare nodding! I wonder politeness me, AuntGrizzel come last thing night touch make keepnodding till morning? I _suppose_ sort policemen thepalace; I dare say sorts beautiful things inside.How I like see it!" But moment faint tick-tick cuckoo clock nextroom, reaching ear, reminded object midnightexpedition hers. She hurried ante-room. It looked darker great saloon, one window. Butthrough uncovered space top window penetratedsome brilliant moonbeams, one lighted brightly face ofthe clock queer over-hanging eaves. Griselda approached stood below, looking up. "Cuckoo," said softly--very softly. But reply. "Cuckoo," repeated rather loudly. "Why speak me? Iknow there, asleep, I heard voice myown room. Why come out, cuckoo?" "Tick-tick," said clock, reply. Griselda felt ready cry. "Cuckoo," said reproachfully, "I think sohard-hearted. I _so_ unhappy you, I pleasedto hear voice again, I thought I killed you, hurt youvery badly; I _mean_ hurt you, cuckoo. I sorry themoment I done it, _dreadfully_ sorry. Dear cuckoo, forgiveme?" There little sound last--a faint _coming_ sound, themoonlight Griselda saw doors open, flew cuckoo. He stoodstill moment, looked round were, gently flapped hiswings, uttered usual note--"Cuckoo." Griselda stood breathless expectation, delight couldnot help softly clapping hands. The cuckoo cleared throat. You never heard funny little noiseas made; then, clear, distinct, yet "cuckoo-y"voice, spoke. "Griselda," said, "are truly sorry?" "I told I was," replied. "But I _feel_ naughty,cuckoo. I not, really. I vexed one minute, Ithrew book I seemed little fun, too. And made meso unhappy went away, poor aunts dreadfullyunhappy too. If come back I told tomorrowwhat I done. I would told before, I afraid itwould made unhappy. I thought I hurt dreadfully." "So did," said cuckoo. "But _look_ quite well," said Griselda. "It _feelings_," replied cuckoo; "and I could help goingaway. I obey orders like people." Griselda stared. "How mean?" asked. "Never mind. You cannot understand present," said cuckoo. "You canunderstand obeying _your_ orders, see, not,things go wrong." "Yes," said Griselda humbly, "they certainly do. But, cuckoo," shecontinued, "I never used get tempers home--_hardly_ never, atleast; I liked lessons then, I never scolded them." "What wrong here, then?" said cuckoo. "It often thingsgo wrong house." "That Dorcas says," said Griselda. "It must achild--my aunts house everything got children'sways." "About time did," remarked cuckoo drily. "And so," continued Griselda, "it really dull. I lots oflessons, much I mind. It I one toplay with." "There something that," said cuckoo. He flapped wings andwas silent minute two. "I consider it," observed atlast. "Thank you," said Griselda, exactly knowing else say. "And meantime," continued cuckoo, "you would better obey presentorders go back bed." "Shall I say good-night you, then?" asked Griselda somewhat timidly. "You quite welcome so," replied cuckoo. "Why shouldn'tyou?" "You see I sure would like it," returned Griselda, "forof course like person, and--and--I told sortsof queer things fairies like like." "Who said I fairy?" inquired cuckoo. "Dorcas did, and, _of course_, common sense too," repliedGriselda. "You must fairy--you could anything else." "I might fairyfied cuckoo," suggested bird. Griselda looked puzzled. "I understand," said, "and I think could make muchdifference. But whatever are, I wish would tell one thing." "What?" said cuckoo. "I want know, forgiven throwing book atyou, come back good?" "Certainly evil," replied cuckoo. Griselda gave little wriggle. "Cuckoo, laughing me," shesaid. "I mean, come back stay cuckoo usual makemy aunts happy again?" "You see morning," said cuckoo. "Now go bed." "Good night," said Griselda, "and thank you, please forget tolet know considered." "Cuckoo, cuckoo," little friend's reply. Griselda thought wasmeant good night, fact matter exactsecond time two clock morning. She made way back bed. She standing time talking tothe cuckoo, but, though well November, feelthe least cold, sleepy! She felt happy light-hearted aspossible, wished morning, might get up. Yet themoment laid little brown curly head pillow, fellasleep; seemed dropped softfeathery wing brushed cheek gently tiny "Cuckoo" sounded inher ear. When woke bright morning, really bright morning, thewintry sun already sending clear yellow rays palegrey-blue sky. "It must late," thought Griselda, opened shuttersand seen light was. "I must slept long time. I feel sobeautifully unsleepy now. I must dress quickly--how nice tosee aunts look happy again! I even care scold forbeing late." But, all, much later usual; muchbrighter morning time. Griselda dressherself quickly, however. As went downstairs two three ofthe clocks house, several, striking eight.These clocks must little right time, wasnot till relapsed silence rang fromthe ante-room clear sweet tones, eight times repeated, "Cuckoo." Miss Grizzel Miss Tabitha already breakfast-table, butthey received little niece graciously. Nothing said aboutthe clock, however, till half-way meal, Griselda,full eagerness know aunts aware cuckoo'sreturn, could restrain longer. "Aunt Grizzel," said, "is cuckoo right again?" "Yes, dear. I delighted say is," replied Miss Grizzel. "Did get put right, Aunt Grizzel?" inquired Griselda, slyly. "Little girls ask many questions," replied Miss Grizzel,mysteriously. "It _is_ right again, enough. During fiftyyears cuckoo never, till yesterday, missed hour. If you, inyour sphere, dear, well fifty years, donebadly." "No, indeed, done badly," repeated Miss Tabitha. But though two old ladies thus tried improve occasion alittle lecturing, Griselda could see bottom heartsthey happy that, even naughty indeed,they could hardly made minds scold her. She inclined naughty day. She something tothink look forward to, made quite different littlegirl, made take heart lessons well shepossibly could. "I wonder cuckoo considered enough noone play with?" said herself, walking downthe terrace back house. "Caw, caw!" screamed rook head, answer herthought. Griselda looked him. "Your voice half pretty cuckoo's, Mr. Rook," said."All same, I dare say I make friends you, Iunderstood meant. How funny would know thelanguages birds beasts, like prince fairytale! I wonder I wish that, fairy gave wish? No,I think I would. I would _far_ rather fairy carpet wouldtake anywhere liked minute. I would go China see allthe people look like Aunt Grizzel's mandarins; I would first ofall, course, go fairyland." "You must come now, little missie," said Dorcas's voice. "MissGrizzel says play enough, nice fire theante-room lessons by." "Play!" repeated Griselda indignantly, turned follow oldservant. "Do call walking terrace 'play,' Dorcas? Imustn't loiter even pick flower, any, fear ofcatching cold, I must run fear overheating myself. Ideclare, Dorcas, I play soon, something amuseme, I think I run away." "Nay, nay, missie, talk like that. You would never anything sonaughty, like Miss Sybilla, good." "Dorcas, I tired told I like Miss Sybilla," said Griselda,impatiently. "She grandmother; one would like told theywere like grandmother. It makes feel face must allscrewy wrinkly, I spectacles wig." "_That_ like Miss Sybilla I first saw her," saidDorcas. "She younger you, missie, pretty fairy." "_Was_ she?" exclaimed Griselda, stopping short. "Yes, indeed was. She might fairy, sweet andgentle--and yet merry. Every creature loved her; even animalsabout seemed know her, one themselves. She broughtgood luck house, sad day left it." "I thought said cuckoo brought good luck?" saidGriselda. "Well, was. The cuckoo Miss Sybilla came day. Itwas left mother's father, lived sinceshe baby, died came sisters. Shewasn't _own_ sister ladies, see, missie. Her mother comefrom Germany, strange place there, hergrandfather lived, cuckoo clock made. They make wonderfulclocks there, I told, none wonderful cuckoo,I sure." "No, I _sure_ not," said Griselda, softly. "Why Miss Sybillatake married went away?" "She knew sisters fond it. It like memory herleft behind them. It like part her. And know,missie, night died--she died soon father born, ayear married--for whole hour, twelve one, thatcuckoo went cuckooing soft, sad way, like living creaturein trouble. Of course, know anything wrong her, andfolks said something caught springs works; but_I_ think so, never shall. And----" But Dorcas's reminiscences abruptly brought close MissGrizzel's appearance end terrace. "Griselda, loitering for? Dorcas, havehastened, delayed Miss Griselda." So Griselda hurried lessons, Dorcas kitchen.But Griselda much mind. She plenty think wonderabout, liked lessons ante-room, thetick-tick clock ears, feeling _perhaps_ thecuckoo watching invisible peep-hole closeddoors. "And sees," thought Griselda, "if sees hard I trying todo lessons well, perhaps make quick about'considering.'" So try hard. And speak cuckoo hecame say four clock. She busy, busy. Shefelt better wait till gave sign ready totalk again. For fairies, know, children, however charming, sometimes_rather_ queer with. They like interferedwith, treated except great respect, ownideas proper not, I assure you. I suppose working hard lessons--most people sayit night before, running house inthe moonlight; never felt "fresh" life whenshe got morning, could hardly that--that Griseldafelt tired sleepy evening, could hardly keep eyesopen. She begged go bed quite half hour earlier usual,which made Miss Tabitha afraid going ill. Butas nothing better children go bed early, even ifthey _are_ going ill, Miss Grizzel told say good-night, andto ask Dorcas give wine-glassful elderberry wine, nice andhot, bed. Griselda objection elderberry wine, though felt shewas false pretences. She certainly need sendher sleep, almost head touched pillow assound top. She slept good long while, wakenedsuddenly--just done night before, thefeeling something wakened her. And queer thing themoment awake felt _very_ awake--she inclination tostretch yawn hope quite time get up, think hownice warm bed was, cold outside! She sat straight up,and peered darkness, feeling quite ready adventure. "Is you, cuckoo?" said softly. There answer, listening intently, child fancied hearda faint rustling fluttering corner room door.She got and, feeling way, opened it, instant doneso heard, steps front seemed, familiarnotes, very, _very_ soft whispered, "Cuckoo, cuckoo." It went on, passage, Griselda trotting after. There wasno moon to-night, heavy clouds quite hidden it, outside therain falling heavily. Griselda could hear window-panes,through closed shutters all. But dark was, made herway along without difficulty, passage, across greatsaloon, ante-room door, guided little voicenow heard front her. She came standstill rightbefore clock, stood minute two patiently waiting. She long wait. There came usual murmuring sound,then doors clock face opened--she heard open, wasfar dark see--and ordinary voice, clear distinct (itwas two clock, cuckoo killing two birds onestone, telling hour greeting Griselda once), bird sangout, "Cuckoo, cuckoo." "Good evening, cuckoo," said Griselda, finished. "Good morning, mean," said cuckoo. "Good morning, then, cuckoo," said Griselda. "Have considered aboutme, cuckoo?" The cuckoo cleared throat. "Have learnt obey orders yet, Griselda?" inquired. "I trying," replied Griselda. "But see, cuckoo, I verylong learn in--it last night told me, know." The cuckoo sighed. "You great deal learn, Griselda." "I dare say I have," said. "But I tell one thing,cuckoo--whatever lessons I have, I _couldn't_ ever worse thanthose addition sums Mr. Kneebreeches'. I made mind aboutthat, to-day, know, cuckoo----" "Yesterday," corrected cuckoo. "Always exact statements,Griselda." "Well, yesterday, then," said Griselda, rather tartly; "though youknow quite well I mean, I see need _very_particular. Well, I saying, I tried _tried_, still theywere fearful. They were, indeed." "You great deal learn, Griselda," repeated cuckoo. "I wish would say often," said Griselda. "I thought youwere going _play_ me." "There something that," said cuckoo, "there something inthat. I like talk it. But could talk comfortablyif would come sit beside me." Griselda thought friend must going mind. "Sit beside there!" exclaimed. "Cuckoo, _could_ I? I'mfar, far big." "Big!" returned cuckoo. "What mean big? It matterof fancy. Do know world everything it,counting course, made little enough go awalnut, would never find difference." "_Wouldn't_ I?" said Griselda, feeling rather muddled; "but, _not_counting myself, cuckoo, I would then, would I?" "Nonsense," said cuckoo hastily; "you great deal learn, andone thing is, _argue_. Nobody argue; shocking badhabit, ruins digestion. Come sit beside mecomfortably. Catch hold chain; find manage youtry." "But stop clock," said Griselda. "Aunt Grizzel said I wasnever touch weights chains." "Stuff," said cuckoo; "it stop clock. Catch hold thechains swing up. There now--I told could manageit." IV THE COUNTRY OF THE NODDING MANDARINS "We nodding, nid-nid-nodding." How managed never knew; but, somehow other, _was_managed. She seemed slide chain easily generalway would slidden down, without disagreeableanticipation bump end journey. And got tothe top wonderfully different looked anything could haveexpected! The doors stood open, Griselda found quite bigenough, quite small enough--which could tell,and matter fancy decided trouble toinquire--to pass quite comfortably. And inside charming little snuggery imaginable. Itwas something like saloon railway carriage--it seemed linedand carpeted everything, rich mossy red velvet; alittle round table middle two arm-chairs, one satthe cuckoo--"quite like people," thought Griselda toherself--while other, pointed Griselda little nod,was evidently intended her. "Thank you," said she, sitting chair spoke. "Are comfortable?" inquired cuckoo. "Quite," replied Griselda, looking great satisfaction."Are cuckoo clocks like get inside them?" sheinquired. "I cannot think room dear little placebetween clock wall. Is hole cut wall onpurpose, cuckoo?" "Hush!" said cuckoo, "we got things talk about. First,shall I lend one mantles? You may feel cold." "I now," replied Griselda; "but perhaps I _might_." She looked little bare feet spoke, wondered _they_weren't cold, chilblainy weather. The cuckoo stood up, one claws reached cornerwhere hanging cloak Griselda noticed. Forit hanging wrong side out, lining red velvet, likewhat sides little room covered with, wondershe noticed it. Had hanging _right_ side must done so; thisside wonderful! It feathers--feathers every shade colour, beautifullyworked in, somehow, lie quite smoothly evenly, one colourmelting away another like prism, couldhardly tell one began another ended. "What _lovely_ cloak!" said Griselda, wrapping round andfeeling even comfortable before, watched rays ofthe little lamp roof--I think I forgetting tell thatthe cuckoo's boudoir lighted dear little lamp set redvelvet roof like pearl ring--playing softly brilliantcolours feather mantle. "It better lovely," said cuckoo, "as shall see. Now,Griselda," continued, tone one coming business--"now,Griselda, let us talk." "We talking," said Griselda, "ever long. I verycomfortable. When say 'let us talk' like that, makes forgetall I wanted say. Just let sit still say whatever comes intomy head." "That do," said cuckoo; "we must plan action." "A what?" said Griselda. "You see _have_ great deal learn," said cuckootriumphantly. "You understand I say." "But I come learn," said Griselda; "I downthere;" nodded head direction ante-room table."I want play." "Just so," said cuckoo; "that I want talk about. What doyou call 'play'--blindman's-buff sort thing?" "No," said Griselda, considering. "I getting rather big thatkind play. Besides, cuckoo, I alone could much fun atblindman's-buff; would catch catch me." "Oh, could easily get more," said cuckoo. "The mandarins would bepleased join." "The mandarins!" repeated Griselda. "Why, cuckoo, alive! Howcould play?" The cuckoo looked gravely minute, shook head. "You _great_ deal learn," said solemnly. "Do knowthat _everything's_ alive?" "No," said Griselda, "I not; I know mean, Idon't think I want know mean. I want talk playing." "Well," said cuckoo, "talk." "What I call playing," pursued Griselda, "is--I thought itnow, see--is amused. If amuse me, cuckoo, I willcount playing me." "How shall I amuse you?" inquired he. "Oh, find out!" exclaimed Griselda. "You might tell mefairy stories, know: fairy know lots; or--ohyes, course would far nicer--if fairy mighttake fairyland." Again cuckoo shook head. "That," said he, "I cannot do." "Why not?" said Griselda. "Lots children there." "I doubt it," said cuckoo. "_Some_ may been, lots. Andsome may thought really thereat all. And there, may sure onething--they _taken_, found way. No one ever was_taken_ fairyland--to real fairyland. They may taken tothe neighbouring countries, fairyland itself." "And one ever find one's way there?" asked Griselda. "That I cannot tell either," replied cuckoo. "There manyroads there; may find day. And ever find it, besure keep see well swept clean, maysee while. Ah, yes, many roads many doorsinto fairyland!" "Doors!" cried Griselda. "Are doors fairyland thishouse?" "Several," said cuckoo; "but waste time looking themat present. It would use." "Then amuse me?" inquired Griselda, ratherdisappointed tone. "Do care go anywhere except fairyland?" said cuckoo. "Oh yes, lots places I would mind seeing. Not geographysort places--it would like lessons go India Africaand places--but _queer_ places, like mines thegoblins make diamonds precious stones, caves thesea mermaids live. And--oh, I thought--now I niceand little, I _would_ like go mandarins' palace thegreat saloon." "That easily managed," said cuckoo; "but--excuse aninstant," exclaimed suddenly. He gave spring forward anddisappeared. Then Griselda heard voice outside doors, "Cuckoo,cuckoo, cuckoo." It three clock. The doors opened let through, re-settled onhis chair. "As I saying," went on, "nothing could easier. Butthat palace, call it, entrance side, wellas one know." "Another door, mean?" said Griselda. "How funny! Does gothrough wall? And lead to?" "It leads," replied cuckoo, "it leads country NoddingMandarins." "_What_ fun!" exclaimed Griselda, clapping hands. "Cuckoo, let usgo there. How get down? You fly, must I slide thechain again?" "Oh dear, no," said cuckoo, "by means. You stretchout feather mantle, flap wings--so"--he flappedhis wings encouragingly--"wish, be." "Where?" said Griselda bewilderedly. "Wherever wish be, course," said cuckoo. "Are ready?Here goes." "Wait--wait moment," cried Griselda. "Where I wish be?" "Bless child!" exclaimed cuckoo. "Where _do_ wish be? Yousaid wanted visit country Nodding Mandarins." "Yes; I wish first palace great saloon?" "Certainly," replied cuckoo. "That entrance Mandarin Land,and said would like see it. So--you surely readynow?" "A thought struck me," said Griselda. "How know whato'clock is, come back time tell next hour? Myaunts get fright go wrong again! Are surewe shall time go mandarins' country to-night?" "Time!" repeated cuckoo; "what time? Ah, Griselda, a_very_ great deal learn! What mean time?" "I know," replied Griselda, feeling rather snubbed. "Being slow orquick--I suppose I mean." "And slow, quick?" said cuckoo. "_All_ matterof fancy! If everything done since world made tillnow, done five minutes, would never know thedifference." "Oh, cuckoo, I wish would not!" cried poor Griselda; "you worsethan sums, puzzle me. It like said nothingbeing big little, worse. Where would days hoursbe nothing minutes? Oh, cuckoo, said would amuseme, nothing puzzle me." "It fault. You would get ready," said cuckoo,"_Now_, goes! Flap wish." Griselda flapped wished. She felt sort rustle air, thatwas all--then found standing cuckoo front theChinese cabinet, door stood open, mandarins oneach side, nodding politely, seemed invite enter. Griseldahesitated. "Go on," said cuckoo, patronizingly; "ladies first." Griselda went on. To surprise, inside cabinet quitelight, though light came illuminated queercorners recesses streamed front, stood themandarins, could discover. The "palace" quite interesting expected. Therewere lots little rooms opening balconies commanding, nodoubt, splendid view great saloon; ever manylittle stair-cases leading little rooms balconies; itall seemed empty deserted. "I care it," said Griselda, stopping short last; "it allthe same, nothing see. I thought aunts kept ever somany beautiful things here, nothing." "Come along, then," said cuckoo. "I expect would care thepalace, called it, much. Let us go way." He hopped sort little staircase near standing,and Griselda followed willingly enough. At foot foundthemselves vestibule, much handsomer entrance otherside, cuckoo, crossing it, lifted one claws touched aspring wall. Instantly pair large doors flew open themiddle, revealing Griselda prettiest curious sight shehad ever seen. A flight wide, shallow steps led doorway along, long avenue bordered stiffly growing trees, branchesof hung innumerable lamps every colour, making perfectnetwork brilliance far eye could reach. "Oh, lovely!" cried Griselda, clapping hands. "It likewalking along rainbow. Cuckoo, come quick." "Stop," said cuckoo; "we good way go. There need towalk. Palanquin!" He flapped wings, instantly palanquin appeared foot ofthe steps. It made carved ivory, borne fourChinese-looking figures pigtails bright-coloured jackets. Afeeling came Griselda dreaming, else hadseen palanquin before. She hesitated. Suddenly gave littlejump satisfaction. "I know," exclaimed. "It exactly like one stands aglass shade Lady Lavander's drawing-room mantelpiece. I wonder itis one? Fancy able get _into_ it!" She looked four bearers. Instantly nodded. "What mean?" asked Griselda, turning cuckoo. "Get in," replied. "Yes, I going get in," said; "but _they_ mean whenthey nod like that?" "They mean, course, I tell you--'Get in,'" said cuckoo. "Why say so, then?" persisted Griselda, getting in, however,as spoke. "Griselda, _very_ great----" began cuckoo, Griseldainterrupted him. "Cuckoo," exclaimed, "if say again, I jump thepalanquin run away home bed. Of course I great deal tolearn--that I like ask questions everything I see. Now,tell going." "In first place," said cuckoo, "are comfortable?" "Very," said Griselda, settling among cushions. It change cuckoo's boudoir. There chairs orseats, number very, _very_ soft cushions covered greensilk. There green silk curtains round, too, coulddraw pleased, touching spring. Griselda strokedthe silk gently. It "fruzzley" silk, know thatmeans; make feel nails wanted cutting, asif rough places skin rubbed wrong way;its softness like rose pansy petal. "What nice silk!" said Griselda. "I would like dress it. I nevernoticed palanquin lined nicely," continued, "for Isuppose _is_ one Lady Lavander's mantelpiece? There couldn'tbe two exactly like other." The cuckoo gave sort whistle. "What goose are, dear!" exclaimed. "Excuse me," hecontinued, seeing Griselda looked rather offended; "I meanto hurt feelings, let say thing, youknow. The palanquin Lady Lavander's! I think not. You mightas well mistake one horrible paper roses Dorcas sticks inher vases one aunt's Gloires de Dijon! The palanquin fromLady Lavander's--a clumsy human imitation worth looking at!" "I know," said Griselda humbly. "Do make beautifulthings Mandarin Land?" "Of course," said cuckoo. Griselda sat silent minute two, soon recovered herspirits. "Will please tell going?" asked again. "You see directly," said cuckoo; "not I mind telling you.There grand reception one palaces to-night. Ithought would like assist it. It give idea apalace like. By-the-by, dance?" "A little," replied Griselda. "Ah, well, I dare say manage. I ordered court dress foryou. It ready get there." "Thank you," said Griselda. In minute two palanquin stopped. The cuckoo got out, andGriselda followed him. She found entrance _very_ much grander palacethan one aunt's saloon. The steps leading door werevery wide shallow, covered gold embroidered carpet, which_looked_ would prickly bare feet, which, thecontrary, trod upon it, felt softer softest moss. Shecould see little besides carpet, side stepsstood rows rows mandarins, something like, great dealgrander than, pair outside aunt's cabinet; cuckoohopped Griselda walked staircase, all, turn, row byrow, began solemnly nod. It gave look field veryhigh grass, which, one passing, leaves moment atrail, till heads bob places. "What mean?" whispered Griselda. "It royal salute," said cuckoo. "A salute!" said Griselda. "I thought meant kissing guns." "Hush!" said cuckoo, time arrived top ofthe staircase; "you must dressed now." Two mandariny-looking young ladies, porcelain faces andthree-cornered head-dresses, stepped forward led Griselda asmall ante-room, lay waiting magnificent dressyou ever saw. But _do_ think dressed her? It bynodding. They nodded blue silver embroidered jacket, amoment fitted her. They nodded splendidscarlet satin skirt, made short front long behind, andbefore Griselda knew was, adjusted quite correctly.They nodded head-dress, sashes, necklaces andbracelets, forthwith arranged themselves. Last all, theynodded dearest, sweetest little pair high-heeled shoesimaginable--all silver, blue, gold, scarlet, everythingmixed together, _only_ rather stumpy shape toesand Griselda's bare feet encased them, and, surprise,quite comfortably so. "They hurt bit," said aloud; "yet look theleast shape foot." But attendants nodded; turning round, saw cuckoowaiting her. He speak either, rather annoyance, butgravely led way one grand room another thegrandest all, entertainment evidently tobegin. And everywhere mandarins, rows rows, setto work nodding fast Griselda appeared. She began rathertired royal salutes, glad when, last, profound silence,the procession, consisting cuckoo herself, half adozen "mandarins," came halt kind daïs, raised seat,at end hall. Upon daïs stood chair--a throne kind, Griselda supposedit be--and upon seated grandest gravest personageshe yet seen. "Is king mandarins?" whispered. But cuckoo notreply; time repeat question, grandand grave person got seat, coming towards offeredher hand, time nodding--first once, two threetimes together, again. Griselda seemed know meant.He asking dance. "Thank you," said. "I cannot dance _very_ well, perhaps won'tmind." The king, title, took slightest notice herreply, nodded again--once, two three times together, thenonce alone, before. Griselda know do, whensuddenly felt something poking head. It cuckoo--he hadlifted claw, tapping head make nod. So shenodded--once, twice together, once--that appeared enough. Theking nodded again; invisible band suddenly struck theloveliest music, set places honour reserved forthem centre room, mandarins assembling. What dance was! It began like minuet ended something likethe haymakers. Griselda least idea figures stepswere, matter. If know, shoes orsomething did; got famously. The music waslovely--"so mandarins cannot deaf, though dumb," thoughtGriselda, "which one good thing them." The king seemed enjoyit much did, though never smiled laughed; one couldhave seen liked way whirled twirled about.And figures, stopped rest little,Griselda got well too. There conversation, rather, ifthere was, nodding. So Griselda nodded too, though know nods meant,the king seemed understand quite pleased; hadnodded enough, music struck again, set, harder thanbefore. And every tiny little mandariny boys appeared traysfilled delicious fruits sweetmeats. Griselda nota greedy child, life really _did_ feel ratherso. I cannot possibly describe delicious things; think ofwhatever life "lovely" thing ever eat, andyou may sure tasted like that. Only cuckoo would eatany, rather distressed Griselda. He walked among thedancers, apparently quite home; mandarins seem allsurprised see him, though look rather odd, nearly, ifnot quite, big them. Griselda hoped enjoyinghimself, considering thank fun _she_ washaving, felt little conscience-stricken saw hewouldn't eat anything. "Cuckoo," whispered; dared talk loud--it would haveseemed remarkable, see. "Cuckoo," said, very, softly, "Iwish would eat something. You tired hungry." "No, thank you," said cuckoo; cannot think pleasedGriselda succeeded making speak. "It way.I hope enjoying yourself?" "Oh, _very_ much," said Griselda. "I----" "Hush!" said cuckoo; looking up, Griselda saw number ofmandarins, sort procession, coming way. When got cuckoo set work nodding, two three ata time, energetically usual. When stopped, cuckoonodded return, hopped towards middle room. "They fond good music, see," whispered passedGriselda; "and often get it." V PICTURES "And always beautifulAnd always eighteen!" When got middle room cuckoo cleared throat,flapped wings, began sing. Griselda quite astonished. Shehad idea friend accomplished. It not"cuckooing" all; real singing, like nightingale orthe thrush, like something prettier either. It made Griseldathink woods summer, tinkling brooks flowing them,with pretty brown pebbles sparkling water; thenit made think something sad--she know what; perhaps wasof babes wood robins covering withleaves--and again, moment, sounded merryelves sprites ever heard escaped fairyland,and rolling peals rollicking laughter. And atlast, sudden, song came end. "Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!" rang three times, clear shrill. Thecuckoo flapped wings, made bow mandarins, retired tohis old corner. There buzz talk, usual performance come aclose, great buzz nodding, Griselda, wishing togive cuckoo much praise could, nodded hard ofthem. The cuckoo really looked quite shy receiving much applause.But minute two music struck dancing beganagain--one, two, three: seemed sort mazurka time, whichsuited mandarins well, gave chance nodding tomark time. Griselda learnt mazurka, got even better thanbefore--only would liked shoes sharpertoes; looked stumpy tried point them. All same,it good fun, well pleased suddenlyfelt little sharp tap cuckoo head, heard himwhisper-- "Griselda, time go." "Oh dear, why?" asked. "I bit tired. Why need go yet?" "Obeying orders," said cuckoo; that, Griselda dared notsay another word. It nearly bad told agreat deal learn. "Must I say good-bye king people?" inquired; butbefore cuckoo time answer, gave little squeal. "Oh,cuckoo," cried, "you trod foot." "I beg pardon," said cuckoo. "I must take shoe; hurt," went on. "Take off, then," said cuckoo. Griselda stooped take shoe. "Are going home thepal----?" began say; never finished sentence, forjust got shoe felt cuckoo throw somethinground her. It feather mantle. And Griselda knew nothing till opened eyes nextmorning, saw first early rays sunshine peeping thechinks closed shutters little bed-room. She rubbed eyes, sat bed. Could dream? "What could made fall asleep sudden?" thought."I least sleepy mandarins' ball. What fun was! Ibelieve cuckoo made fall asleep purpose make fancy itwas dream. _Was_ dream?" She began feel confused doubtful, suddenly feltsomething hurting arm, like little lump bed. She felt withher hand see could smooth away, drew out--one theshoes belonging court dress! The one held herhand moment cuckoo spirited home bed. "Ah, Mr. Cuckoo!" exclaimed, "you meant play trick, youhaven't succeeded, see." She jumped bed unfastened one window-shutters, thenjumped admire little shoe comfort. It evenprettier thought ball. She held lookedat it. It size first joint little finger."To think I dancing last night!" shesaid shoe. "And yet cuckoo says big little amatter fancy. I wonder think amuse next?" She still holding shoe admiring Dorcas came withthe hot water. "Look, Dorcas," said. "Bless me, one shoes Chinese dolls saloon,"exclaimed old servant. "How ever get that, missie? Youraunts would pleased." "It one Chinese dolls' shoes, believeme, go look yourself," said Griselda. "It ownshoe, given self." Dorcas looked curiously, said more, goingout room Griselda heard saying something "so likeMiss Sybilla." "I wonder 'Miss Sybilla' _was_ like?" thought Griselda. "I agood mind ask cuckoo. He seems known well." It days Griselda chance asking cuckooanything. She saw heard nothing him--nothing, say, buthis regular appearance tell hours usual. "I suppose," thought Griselda, "he thinks mandarins' ball funenough last good while. It really good-natured himto take it, I must grumble." A days poor Griselda caught cold. It badcold, I must confess, aunts made rather fuss it. Theywanted stay bed, Griselda much objected thatthey insist upon it. "It would dull," said piteously. "Please let stay theante-room, things there; and, then, cuckoo." Aunt Grizzel smiled this, Griselda got way. But even theante-room rather dull. Miss Grizzel Miss Tabitha wereobliged go out, drive way Merrybrow Hall, LadyLavander sent messenger say attack influenza,and wished see friends once. Miss Tabitha began cry--she tender-hearted. "Troubles never come singly," said Miss Grizzel, way consolation. "No, indeed, never come singly," said Miss Tabitha, shaking herhead wiping eyes. So set; Griselda, arm-chair ante-room fire,with queer little old-fashioned books aunts', hadalready read dozen times, beside way amusement,felt one comfort troubles--she escaped thelong weary drive godmother's. But dull. It got duller duller. Griselda curled herselfup chair, wished could go sleep, though feeling quitesure could not, stayed bed much later usual thismorning, obliged spend time sleeping, want ofanything better do. She looked clock. "I know even wish for," said herself. "I feelthe least inclined play anything, I care go tothe mandarins again. Oh, cuckoo, cuckoo, I dull; could youthink anything amuse me?" It near "any clock." But waiting minute two, itseemed Griselda heard soft sound "coming" alwayspreceded cuckoo's appearance. She right. In another moment sheheard usual greeting, "Cuckoo, cuckoo!" "Oh, cuckoo!" exclaimed, "I glad come last. I _am_so dull, nothing lessons time. It I'vegot bad cold, head's aching, I tired reading,all myself." "What would like do?" said cuckoo. "You want go tosee mandarins again?" "Oh no; I could dance." "Or mermaids sea?" "Oh, dear, no," said Griselda, little shiver, "it would fartoo cold. I would like stay I am, one would tellme stories. I even sure I could listen stories. What couldyou amuse me, cuckoo?" "Would like see pictures?" said cuckoo. "I could showyou pictures without taking trouble." "Oh yes, would beautiful," cried Griselda. "What pictures willyou show me? Oh, I know. I would like see place wereborn--where very, clever man made clock, I mean." "Your great-great-grandfather," said cuckoo. "Very well. Now,Griselda, shut eyes. First all, I going sing." Griselda shut eyes, cuckoo began song. It somethinglike sung mandarins' palace, even morebeautiful. It soft dreamy, Griselda felt could havesat ever, listening it. The first notes low murmuring. Again made Griselda thinkof little rippling brooks summer, came sortof hum insects buzzing warm sunshine near. This humminggradually increased, till last Griselda conscious nothingmore--_everything_ seemed humming, too, till last shefell asleep. When opened eyes, ante-room everything it, except thearm-chair still curled up, disappeared--melted awayinto misty cloud round her, turn gradually faded, tillbefore saw scene quite new strange. It first ofthe cuckoo's "pictures." An old, quaint room, high, carved mantelpiece, bright firesparkling grate. It pretty room--it lookof workshop kind; curious interesting. Allround, walls hung clocks strange mechanical toys.There fiddler slowly fiddling, gentleman lady gravelydancing minuet, little man drawing water bucket aglass vase gold fish swimming about--all sorts queerfigures; clocks even queerer. There one intended torepresent sun, moon, planets, one face sun andanother moon, gold silver stars slowly circling roundthem; another clock tiny trumpeter perched ledgeabove face, blew horn hours. I cannot tell halfthe strange wonderful things were. Griselda interested looking queer machines, thatshe time observe occupant room. And nowonder; sitting front little table, perfectly still,much still un-living figures around him. He examining,with magnifying glass, small object held hand, soclosely intently Griselda, forgetting looking a"picture," almost held breath fear disturb him. Hewas old man, coat worn threadbare several places,looking spent great part life one position. Yet hedid look _poor_, face, last lifted it, mildand intelligent earnest. While Griselda watching closely came soft tap thedoor, little girl danced room. The dearest little girlyou ever saw, _so_ funnily dressed! Her thick brown hair, ratherlighter Griselda's, tied two long plaits back. Shehad short red skirt silver braid round bottom, whitechemisette beautiful lace throat wrists, thatagain black velvet bodice, also trimmed silver. And agreat many trinkets, necklaces, bracelets, ear-rings, sortof little silver coronet; no, like coronet, bandwith square piece silver fastened stand side ofher head something like horse's blinkers, placedover eyes. She made quite jingle came room, old manlooked smile pleasure. "Well, darling, ready _fête_?" said; andthough language spoke quite strange Griselda, sheunderstood meaning perfectly well. "Yes, dear grandfather; dress lovely?" said child. "Ishould _so_ happy coming too, would getyourself beautiful velvet coat like Mynheer van Huyten." The old man shook head. "I time things, darling," replied; "and besides,I old. I must work--work hard make money pet I amgone, may dependent bounty Englishsisters." "But I care money gone, grandfather," said thechild, eyes filling tears. "I would rather go living inthis little house, I sure neighbours would give somethingto eat, I could hear clocks ticking, think you.I want sell wonderful things money me,grandfather. They would remind you, money would not." "Not all, Sybilla, all," said old man. "The best all, the_chef-d'oeuvre_ life, shall sold. It shall yours,and possession clock crowned heads mightseek vain purchase." His dim old eyes brightened, moment sat erect strong. "Do mean cuckoo clock?" said Sybilla, low voice. "Yes, darling, cuckoo clock, crowning work life--aclock shall last long I, perhaps thou, pretty child,are crumbling dust; clock shall last tell mygreat-grandchildren many generations old Dutch mechanic wasnot altogether despised." Sybilla sprang arms. "You talk like that, little grandfather," said. "I shallteach children grandchildren proud you--oh, soproud!--as proud I you, little grandfather." "Gently, darling," said old man, placed carefully thetable delicate piece mechanism held hand, tenderlyembraced child. "Kiss again, pet, thou must go;thy little friends waiting." * * * * * As said words mist slowly gathered Griselda'seyes--the first cuckoo's pictures faded sight. * * * * * When looked scene changed, time astrange one, though Griselda gazed moments sherecognized it. It great saloon, looked differentfrom ever seen it. Forty years make difference inrooms well people! The faded yellow damask hangings rich brilliant. There werebouquets lovely flowers arranged tables; wax lights weresending brightness every direction, room wasfilled ladies gentlemen gay attire. Among them, time, Griselda remarked two ladies, longer veryyoung, still handsome stately, something whispered herthat two aunts, Miss Grizzel Miss Tabitha. "Poor aunts!" said softly herself; "how old grown sincethen." But long look them; attention attracted muchyounger lady--a mere girl seemed, oh, sweet pretty! Shewas dancing gentleman whose eyes looked saw oneelse, seemed brimming youth happiness. Hervery steps joy them. "Well, Griselda," whispered voice, knew cuckoo's;"so like told like grandmother, eh?" Griselda turned round sharply look speaker, tobe seen. And turned again, picture great saloon hadfaded away. * * * * * One picture. Griselda looked again. She saw country road full summertime; sun shining, birds singing, trees coveredwith bright green leaves--everything appeared happy joyful.But last distance saw, slowly approaching, group afew people, walking together, carrying centre somethinglong narrow, which, though black cloth covering almosthidden white flowers thickly strewn, Griseldaknew coffin. It funeral procession, place chief mourner, withpale, set face, walked young man Griselda last seendancing girl Sybilla great saloon. The sad group passed slowly sight; disappeared therefell upon ear sounds sweet music, lovelier far hadheard before--lovelier magic cuckoo's lovely songs--andsomehow, music, seemed child's fancy mingledthe soft strains woman's voice. "It Sybilla singing," thought Griselda dreamily, shefell asleep again. * * * * * When woke arm-chair ante-room fire, everythingaround looking usual, cuckoo clock ticking away calmlyand regularly. Had dream only? Griselda could make hermind. "But I see matters was," said herself. "If itwas dream, cuckoo sent same, I thank verymuch indeed, cuckoo," went on, looking clock. "The lastpicture rather sad, still nice see it, Ithank much, I never say I like betold I like dear pretty grandmother." The cuckoo took notice said, Griselda mind.She getting used "ways." "I expect hears quite well," thought; "and even not,it civil _try_ thank him." She sat still contentedly enough, thinking seen, andtrying make "pictures" fire. Then camefaintly ears sound carriage wheels, opening shuttingof doors, little bustle arrival. "My aunts must come back," thought Griselda; was. In afew minutes Miss Grizzel, closely followed Miss Tabitha, appeared atthe ante-room door. "Well, love," said Miss Grizzel anxiously, "and you? Has thetime seemed long away?" "Oh no, thank you, Aunt Grizzel," replied Griselda, "not all. I'vebeen quite happy, cold's ever much better, headache's_quite_ gone." "Come, good news," said Miss Grizzel. "Not I exactly_surprised_," continued, turning Miss Tabitha, "for reallyis nothing like tansy tea feverish cold." "Nothing," agreed Miss Tabitha; "there really nothing like it." "Aunt Grizzel," said Griselda, moments' silence, "was mygrandmother quite young died?" "Yes, love, young," replied Miss Grizzel change hervoice. "And husband _very_ sorry?" pursued Griselda. "Heart-broken," said Miss Grizzel. "He live long after, thenyou know, dear, father sent us take care of. And nowhe sent _you_--the third generation young creatures confided toour care." "Yes," said Griselda. "My grandmother died summer, theflowers out; buried pretty country place, wasn'tshe?" "Yes," said Miss Grizzel, looking rather bewildered. "And little girl lived grandfather, oldDutch mechanic," continued Griselda, unconsciously using wordsshe heard vision. "He nice old man; clever ofhim made cuckoo clock, lots pretty,wonderful things. I wonder little Sybilla loved him; sogood her. But, oh, Aunt Grizzel, _how_ pretty ayoung lady! That time danced grandfather greatsaloon. And nice Aunt Tabitha looked then, too." Miss Grizzel held breath astonishment; doubt MissTabitha known so, would held too. ButGriselda lay still, gazing fire, quite unconscious aunt'ssurprise. "Your papa told old stories, I suppose, dear," saidMiss Grizzel last. "Oh no," said Griselda dreamily. "Papa never told anything like that.Dorcas told little, I think; least, made want toknow, I asked cuckoo, then, see, showed all. Itwas pretty." Miss Grizzel glanced sister. "Tabitha, dear," said low voice, "do hear?" And Miss Tabitha, really deaf set tohear, nodded awe-struck silence. "Tabitha," continued Miss Grizzel tone, "it wonderful!Ah, yes, true is, Tabitha, 'there things heavenand earth dreamt philosophy'" (for Miss Grizzel awell-read old lady, see); "and first, Tabitha, wealways feeling child strangely like Sybilla." "Strangely like Sybilla," echoed Miss Tabitha. "May grow good, quite beautiful--_that_ couldscarcely expect; may longer spared love her,"added Miss Grizzel, bending Griselda, two three tearsslowly trickled aged cheeks. "See, Tabitha, dear child isfast asleep. How sweet looks! I trust to-morrow morning willbe quite again; cold much better." VI RUBBED THE WRONG WAY "For comes dayWhen everything goes wrong." Griselda's cold _was_ much better "to-morrow morning." In fact, Imight almost say quite well. But Griselda feel quite well, saying reminds methat hardly sense speak _cold_ better well--for acold's "well" means all, existence,in short, thing existence say anythingabout it? Children, I feel quite hobble--I cannot get mindstraight it--please think give opinion. In themeantime, I go Griselda. She felt little ill--a sort feeling sometimes rathernice, sometimes "very extremely" much reverse! She felt thehumour petted, beef-tea, jelly, sponge cakewith tea, day two well. She _was_petted, lots beef-tea, jelly, grapes, spongecakes, everything nice, aunts, must seen thistime, really very, kind every way theyunderstood so. But days continued petting, beef-tea thejelly rest it, occurred Miss Grizzel, agood large bump "common sense," might possible overdothis sort thing. "Tabitha," said sister, sitting together inthe evening Griselda gone bed, "Tabitha, dear, I thinkthe child quite well now. It seems would well tosend note good Mr. Kneebreeches, say able toresume studies day to-morrow." "The day to-morrow," repeated Miss Tabitha. "The day afterto-morrow--to say able resume studies dayafter to-morrow--oh yes, certainly. It would well send noteto good Mr. Kneebreeches, dear Grizzel." "I thought would agree me," said Miss Grizzel, sigh ofrelief (as poor Miss Tabitha last half-century hadever ventured anything else), getting fetch writingmaterials spoke. "It satisfaction consult togetherabout do. I little afraid hard upon thechild, agree me, I longer misgiving." "Any misgiving, oh dear, no!" said Miss Tabitha. "You reasonfor misgiving, I sure, dear Grizzel." So note written despatched, next morning when, abouttwelve clock, Griselda made appearance little drawing-roomwhere aunts usually sat, looking, must confessed, plumpand rosy invalid, Miss Grizzel broached subject. "I written request Mr. Kneebreeches resume instructionsto-morrow," said quietly. "I think quite well now, soDorcas must wake usual hour." Griselda settling comfortably corner sofa.She got nice book read, father, hearing herillness, sent post, looking forward thetempting plateful jelly Dorcas brought luncheonevery day since ill. Altogether, feeling very"lazy-easy" contented. Her aunt's announcement felt like suddendownpour cold water, rush east wind. She sat straight hersofa, exclaimed tone great annoyance-- "_Oh_, Aunt Grizzel!" "Well, dear?" said Miss Grizzel, placidly. "I _wish_ would make begin lessons yet. I _know_they'll make head ache again, Mr. Kneebreeches _so_cross. I know will, horrid cross." "Hush!" said Miss Grizzel, holding hand way remindedGriselda cuckoo's favourite "obeying orders." Just then, too, inthe distance ante-room clock struck twelve. "Cuckoo! cuckoo!cuckoo!" went. Griselda could stamped irritation, but_somehow_, spite herself, felt compelled say nothing. Shemuttered pretty words, coiled round sofa,opened book, began read. But interesting expected. She read manypages began yawn, delighted interruptedby Dorcas jelly. But jelly nice expected, either. She tastedit, thought sweet; tasted again, itseemed strong cinnamon; third taste seemed strong ofeverything. She laid spoon, looked herdiscontentedly. "What matter, dear?" said Miss Grizzel. "Is jelly toyour liking?" "I know," said Griselda shortly. She ate spoonfuls, thentook book again. Miss Grizzel said nothing more, herselfshe thought Mr. Kneebreeches recalled soon. All day long much same. Nothing seemed come right toGriselda. It dull, cold day, called "a black frost"; abright, clear, _pretty_, cold day, sort frost reallymakes world seem dead--makes almost impossible believe thatthere ever warmth sound "growing-ness" again. Late afternoon Griselda crept ante-room, sat downby window. Outside nearly dark, inside muchmore cheerful--for fire nearly out, lamps lighted;only cuckoo clock went tick-ticking briskly usual. "I hate winter," said Griselda, pressing cold little face againstthe colder window-pane, "I hate winter, I hate lessons. I would giveup _person_ minute I might a--a--what would I bestlike be? Oh yes, I know--a butterfly. Butterflies never see winter,and _certainly_ never lessons kind work do. Ihate _must_-ing anything." "Cuckoo," rang suddenly head. It four o'clockstriking, soon told cuckoo back behind hisdoors instant, usual. There nothing forGriselda feel offended at, somehow got quite angry. "I care think, cuckoo!" exclaimed defiantly. "I knowyou came purpose now, I care. I _do_ hate winter,and I _do_ hate lessons, I _do_ think would nicer abutterfly little girl." In secret heart I fancy half hopes cuckoo wouldcome again, talk things her. Even scoldher, felt would better sitting alone withnobody speak to, dull work indeed. At bottom ofher conscience lurked knowledge _should_ bedoing looking last lessons Mr. Kneebreeches, andrefreshing memory next day; but, alas! knowing one's duty isby means thing it, Griselda sat thewindow nothing grumble work belief thatshe one most-to-be-pitied little girls world. Sothat time Dorcas came call tea, I doubt asingle pleasant thought feeling left heart. Things grew better tea, long Griselda asked shemight go bed. She "so tired," said; certainly lookedso, ill-humour idleness excellent "tirers," soontake roses child's cheeks, brightness hereyes. She held face kissed aunts meeklyreproachful way, made old ladies feel quite uncomfortable. "I means sure I done right recalling Mr.Kneebreeches soon, Sister Tabitha," remarked Miss Grizzel, uneasily,when Griselda left room. But Miss Tabitha busy counting herstitches, give full attention Miss Grizzel's observation,so repeated placidly, "Oh yes, Sister Grizzel, may sureyou done right recalling Mr. Kneebreeches." "I glad think so," said Miss Grizzel, little sigh ofrelief. "I distressed see child looking white andtired." Upstairs Griselda hurry-scurrying bed. There lovely firein room--fancy that! Was poor neglected little creature?But even please her. She cross pleased withanything; cross wash face hands, let Dorcas brush herhair nicely usual; cross, alas, say prayers! She justhuddled bed, huddling mind untidy hurry confusion,just left clothes untidy heap floor. She wouldnot look herself, truth it; shrank sobecause _knew_ things going silly little heartof unsatisfactory way day, wanted go tosleep forget it. She go sleep, quickly too. No doubt really tired;tired crossness nothing, slept soundly. Whenshe woke felt refreshed rested fancied must bemorning. It dark, course, expected inmid-winter, especially shutters closed. "I wonder," thought Griselda, "I wonder really _is_ morning. Ishould like get early--I went early bed. I think I justjump bed open chink shutters. I see ifit's nearly morning, look sky." She minute, feeling way across room window,and without much difficulty found hook shutters,unfastened it, threw one side open. Ah no, sign ofmorning seen. There moonlight, nothing else, sovery much that, clouds hurrying across "orbèdmaiden's" face rate, one other, light wasmore like number pale flashes steady, cold shining mostfrosty moonlight nights. There going change weather, andthe cloud armies collecting together quarters; wasthe real explanation hurrying skurrying Griselda sawoverhead, this, course, understand. She saw thatit looked wild stormy, shivered little, partly cold,partly half-frightened feeling could explained. "I better go back bed," said herself; "but I bitsleepy." She drawing-to shutter again, something caught hereye, stopped short surprise. A little bird outside thewindow-sill--a tiny bird crouching close cold glass.Griselda's kind heart touched instant. Cold was, shepushed back shutter again, drawing chair forward thewindow, managed unfasten it--it heavy one--and toopen wide enough slip hand gently along bird. It didnot start move. "Can dead?" thought Griselda anxiously. But no, dead. It let put hand round draw itin, delight felt soft warm, evengave gentle peck thumb. "Poor little bird, cold must be," said kindly. But, heramazement, sooner bird safely inside room, itmanaged cleverly escape hand. It fluttered quietly toher shoulder, sang soft cheery tone, "Cuckoo,cuckoo--cold, say, Griselda? Not very, thank you." Griselda stept back window. "It _you_, it?" said rather surlily, tone seeming inferthat taken great deal trouble nothing. "Of course is, be? You generally sosorry see me. What matter?" "Nothing's matter," replied Griselda, feeling little ashamed ofher want civility; "only, see, I known _you_----"She hesitated. "You would clambered hurt poor fingers openingthe window known me--is it, eh?" said cuckoo. Somehow, cuckoo said "eh?" like that, Griselda obliged totell thinking. "No, I would _needed_ open window," said. "_You_ canget whenever like; like real bird. Of course,you tricking me, sitting pretending astarved robin." There little indignation voice, gave head atoss, nearly upset cuckoo. "Dear me, dear me!" exclaimed cuckoo. "You great deal tocomplain of, Griselda. Your time strength must valuable foryou regret much wasted little me." Griselda felt face grow red. What mean? Did know howyesterday spent? She said nothing, drooped head,and one two tears came slowly creeping eyes. "Child!" said cuckoo, suddenly changing tone, "you veryfoolish. Is kind thought action _ever_ wasted? Can eyes seewhat good seeds grow into? They wings, Griselda--kindnesseshave wings roots, remember that--wings never droop, rootsthat never die. What think I came sat outside windowfor?" "Cuckoo," said Griselda humbly, "I sorry." "Very well," said cuckoo, "we leave present. I havesomething else see about. Are cold, Griselda?" "_Very_," replied. "I would much like go back bed,cuckoo, please; plenty room too, you'dlike come get warm." "There ways getting warm besides going bed," said thecuckoo. "A nice brisk walk, instance. I going ask comeout garden me." Griselda almost screamed. "Out garden! _Oh_, cuckoo!" exclaimed, "how thinkof thing? Such freezing cold night. Oh no, indeed, cuckoo, Icouldn't possibly." "Very well, Griselda," said cuckoo; "if yet learnt totrust me, said. Good-night." He flapped wings, cried "Cuckoo" only, flew across theroom, almost Griselda understood doing, haddisappeared. She hurried him, stumbling furniture haste, andby uncertain light. The door open, cuckoo gotthrough it--"by keyhole, I dare say," thought Griselda; "he can'scrooge' way"--for faint "Cuckoo" heard onits side. In moment Griselda opened it, speedingdown long passage dark, guided voice time totime heard her, "Cuckoo, cuckoo." She forgot cold, rather, feel it, thoughthe floor uncarpeted old oak, whose hard, polished surface wouldhave usually felt like ice child's soft, bare feet. It verylong passage, to-night, somehow, seemed longer ever. Infact, Griselda could fancied running along halfa mile more, last brought standstill findingshe could go further. Where she? She could imagine! It mustbe part house never explored daytime, shedecided. In front little stair running downwards, andending doorway. All Griselda could see bright light thatstreamed keyhole chinks round door--alight brilliant little girl blinked eyes, amoment felt quite dazzled confused. "It came suddenly," said herself; "some one must lighteda lamp once. But cannot lamp, bright fora lamp. It like sun; ever could sun shining ina room middle night? What shall I do? Shall I open thedoor peep in?" "Cuckoo, cuckoo," came answer, soft clear, side. "Can trick cuckoo's get garden?"thought Griselda; first time since run herroom shiver cold made teeth chatter skin feel creepy. "Cuckoo, cuckoo," sounded again, nearer time, seemed toGriselda. "He waiting me. I _will_ trust him," said resolutely. "He hasalways good kind, horrid think going totrick me." She ran little stair, seized handle door. Itturned easily; door opened--opened, closed noiselesslybehind her, think saw? "Shut eyes minute, Griselda," said cuckoo's voice besideher; "the light dazzle first. Shut them, I brushthem little daisy dew, strengthen them." Griselda told. She felt tip cuckoo's softestfeather pass gently two three times eyelids, deliciousscent seemed immediately float her. "I know _daisies_ scent," remarked. "Perhaps not. You forget, Griselda, great----" "Oh, please not, cuckoo. Please, please not, _dear_ cuckoo," sheexclaimed, dancing hands clasped entreaty, hereyes still firmly closed. "Do say that, I promise believewhatever tell me. And soon may I open eyes, please, cuckoo?" "Turn round slowly, three times. That give dew time takeeffect," said cuckoo. "Here goes--one--two--three. There, now." Griselda opened eyes. VII BUTTERFLY-LAND "I would butterfly." Griselda opened eyes. What see? The loveliest, loveliest garden ever never little girl's eyessaw. As describing it, I cannot. I must leave good deal yourfancy. It _delicious_ garden. There charming mixture needed make gardenperfect--grass, velvety lawn rather; water, little brook rantinkling out, playing bopeep among bushes; trees, course,and flowers, course, flowers every shade shape. But thesebeautiful things Griselda first give much attention asthey deserved; eyes occupied quite unusual sight thatmet them. This butterflies! Not butterflies uncommon; butbutterflies, Griselda saw them, I quite sure, children, none ofyou ever saw, likely see. There enormous numbers ofthem, variety colours sizes great. They werefluttering everywhere; garden seemed actually alive them. Griselda stood moment silent delight, feasting eyes thelovely things her, enjoying delicious sunshine kissedher poor little bare feet, seemed wrap warmembrace. Then turned little friend. "Cuckoo," said, "I thank _so_ much. This _is_ fairyland, atlast!" The cuckoo smiled, I going say, would figure ofspeech only, would not? He shook head gently. "No, Griselda," said kindly; "this butterfly-land." "_Butterfly_-land!" repeated Griselda, little disappointment inher tone. "Well," said cuckoo, "it wishing yesterday,is it?" Griselda particularly like allusions "yesterday." Shethought would well change subject. "It beautiful place, whatever is," said, "and I sure,cuckoo, I _very_ much obliged bringing here. Now may Irun look everything? How delicious feel warmsunshine again! I know cold I was. Look, cuckoo, toes andfingers quite blue; beginning come right again.I suppose sun always shines here. How nice must abutterfly; think so, cuckoo? Nothing fly about." She stopped last, quite breath. "Griselda," said cuckoo, "if want answer questions,you must ask one time. You may run look ateverything like, better hurry. Youwill make great many mistakes are--you made already." "How?" said Griselda. "_Have_ butterflies nothing fly about? Watch them." Griselda watched. "They seem something," said, last, "but I can'tthink what. They seem nibbling flowers, flyingaway something like bees gathering honey. _Butterflies_ gatherhoney, cuckoo?" "No," said cuckoo. "They filling paint-boxes." "What _do_ mean?" said Griselda. "Come see," said cuckoo. He flew quietly along front her, leading way theprettiest paths pretty garden. The paths arranged indifferent colours, were; say, flowers growing alongtheir sides "mixty-maxty," one shade another inregular order--from palest blush pink deepest damaskcrimson; then, again, soft greenish blue small grassforget-me-not rich warm tinge brilliant cornflower._Every_ tint there; shades, which, though exactly strange toher, Griselda could yet given name, daisy dew, see,had sharpened eyes observe delicate variations colour, shehad never done before. "How beautifully flowers planned," said cuckoo. "Isit look pretty, why?" "It saves time," replied cuckoo. "The fetch-and-carry butterfliesknow exactly go tint world-flower-painterswant." "Who fetch-and-carry butterflies, theworld-flower-painters?" asked Griselda. "Wait bit see, use eyes," answered cuckoo."It tongue harm rest then." Griselda thought well take advice, though particularlyrelishing manner given. She use eyes, asshe cuckoo made way along flower alleys, saw thatthe butterflies never idle. They came regularly, little partiesof twos threes, nibbled away, called it, flowers ofthe colour different shades, till got theywanted. Then flew butterfly No. 1 perhaps palest tint ofmaize, yellow, lavender, whichever quest of, followed byNo. 2 next deeper shade same, No. 3 bringing therear. Griselda gave little sigh. "What matter?" said cuckoo. "They work hard," replied, melancholy tone. "It busy time year," observed cuckoo, drily. After came seemed sort centre thegarden. It huge glass house, numberless doors, ofwhich butterflies incessantly flying--reminding Griselda ofbees beehive. But made remark till cuckoo spoke again. "Come in," said. Griselda stoop good deal, manage get withoutknocking head damage. Inside mass ofbutterflies. A confused mass seemed first, shesaw reverse confused. The butterflies allsettled rows long, narrow, white tables, atiny object size flattened-out pin's head, wasmost carefully painting one tentacles, which, time totime, moistened rubbing head butterfly waitingpatiently behind him. Behind butterfly stood another, whoafter took place, first attendant flew away. "To fill paint-box again," remarked cuckoo, seemed readGriselda's thoughts. "But _are_ painting, cuckoo?" inquired eagerly. "All flowers world," replied cuckoo. "Autumn, winter, andspring, hard work. It three months ofsummer butterflies holiday, stray onesnow wander world, people talk 'idlebutterflies'! And even true idle. They go upto take look flowers, see work turned out, andmany damaged petal repair, touch faded tint, though noone ever knows it." "_I_ know now," said Griselda. "I never talk idlebutterflies again--never. But, cuckoo, paint flowers_here_, too? What _fearful_ lot must do!" "No," said cuckoo; "the flowers fairy flowers. Theynever fade die, always see them. But coloursof flowers taken them, seen. Of coursethey look there," went on, slightcontemptuous shrug cuckoo shoulders; "the coarse air uglythings must take bloom off. The wild flowers best, tomy thinking; people meddle stupid, clumsy way." "But get flowers sent world, cuckoo?" askedGriselda. "They packed up, course, taken night areasleep," said cuckoo. "They painted elastic stuff, see,which fits plant grows. Why, eyes areusually, Griselda, could even _see_ petals butterfliesare painting now." "And packing up," said Griselda; "do butterflies too?" "No," said cuckoo, "the fairies look that." "How wonderful!" exclaimed Griselda. But cuckoo time tosay sudden tumult filled air. It butterfly dinner-time! "Are hungry, Griselda?" said cuckoo. "Not very," replied Griselda. "It well perhaps not," remarked, "for I don'tknow would much better dinner here." "Why not?" inquired Griselda curiously. "What dinner?Honey? I like well, spread top bread-and-butter, ofcourse--I think I care eat alone." "You get honey," cuckoo beginning; wasinterrupted. Two handsome butterflies flew great glass hall,and making straight cuckoo, alighted shoulders. Theyfluttered minute two, evidently rather excited aboutsomething, flew away again, suddenly appeared. "Those royal messengers," said cuckoo, turning Griselda."They come message king queen invite us abanquet held honour visit." "What fun!" cried Griselda. "Do let us go once, cuckoo. But, oh dearme," went on, melancholy change tone, "I forgetting,cuckoo. I cannot go banquet. I nothing night-gown.I never thought before, I bit cold." "Never mind," said cuckoo, "I soon put rights." He flew off, back almost immediately, followed whole flockof butterflies. They smaller kind Griselda hithertoseen, two colours only; half blue, half yellow.They flew Griselda, felt moment reallygoing suffocated them, moment. There seemed agreat buzz flutter her, butterflies set workto _dress_ her. And think dressed her? With_themselves_! They arranged cleverestway. One set blue ones clustered round hem littlenight-gown, making thick "_ruche_," were; cametwo three thinner rows yellow, blue again. Round herwaist made loveliest belt mingled blue yellow, allover upper part night-gown, among pretty whitefrills Dorcas "goffered," nicely, made themselvesinto fantastic trimmings every shape kind; bows, rosettes--Icannot tell imitate. Perhaps prettiest ornament coronet wreath theymade head, dotting curly brown hair toowith butterfly spangles, quivered like dew-drops movedabout. No one would known Griselda; _looked_ like fairyqueen, princess, least, even little white feet whatlooked like butterfly shoes upon them, though these, willunderstand, sort make-believe, as, course, shoeswere soleless. "Now," said cuckoo, last quiet again, every blueand every yellow butterfly seemed settled place, "now, Griselda,come look yourself." He led way marble basin, fell waters one ofthe tinkling brooks found everywhere garden,and bade Griselda look water mirror. It danced rather;but still quite able see herself. She peered greatsatisfaction, turning round see first oneshoulder, other. "It _is_ lovely," said last. "But, cuckoo, I thinking--howshall I possibly able sit without crushing ever many?" "Bless you, need trouble that," said cuckoo; "thebutterflies quite able take care themselves. You supposeyou first little girl ever made dress for?" Griselda said more, followed cuckoo, walking rather"gingerly," notwithstanding assurances butterflies couldtake care themselves. At last cuckoo stopped, front sortof banked-up terrace, centre grew strange-lookingplant large, smooth, spreading-out leaves, two topmostleaves, splendid wings glittering sunshine, sat twomagnificent butterflies. They many times larger Griseldahad yet seen; fact, cuckoo looked rather small besidethem, _so_ beautiful Griselda felt quite over-awed.You could said colour were, faintestmovement seemed change new colours, exquisitethan last. Perhaps I could best give idea sayingthat like living rainbows. "Are king queen?" asked Griselda whisper. "Yes," said cuckoo. "Do admire them?" "I rather think I did," said Griselda. "But, cuckoo, theynever anything lie sunshine?" "Oh, silly girl," exclaimed cuckoo, "always jumping atconclusions. No, indeed, manage things inbutterfly-land. The king queen worked harder otherbutterflies. They chosen every then, others,as industrious cleverest theworld-flower-painters, allowed rest, fed onthe finest essences, grow splendid see. But evennow idle; superintend work done, andchoose new colours." "Dear me!" said Griselda, breath, "how clever must be." Just butterfly king queen stretched magnificentwings, rose upwards, soaring proudly air. "Are going away?" said Griselda disappointed tone. "Oh no," said cuckoo; "they welcoming you. Hold hands." Griselda held hands, stood gazing sky. In aminute two royal butterflies appeared again, slowly, majesticallycircling downwards, till length alighted Griselda's littlehands, king right, queen left, almost coveringher fingers great dazzling wings. "You _do_ look nice now," said cuckoo, hopping back steps andlooking Griselda approvingly; "but time feast tobegin, us late." The king queen appeared understand. They floated away fromGriselda's hands settled themselves, time, one end abeautiful little grass plot lawn, terrace grewthe large-leaved plant. This evidently dining-room, nosooner places butterflies every kind andcolour came pouring in, masses, directions. Butterfliessmall butterflies large; butterflies light butterflies dark;butterflies blue, pink, crimson, green, gold-colour--_every_ colour, andfar, far colours could possibly imagine. They settled down, round sides grassy dining-table, andin another minute number small white butterflies appeared,carrying among flower petals carefully rolled up, containing adrop liquid. One presented king, one tothe queen, sniffed petal instant, thenpassed butterfly next them, whereupon fresh petals werehanded them, passed on. "What doing, cuckoo?" said Griselda; "that _eating_." "It kind eating," replied. "They require otherkind food sniff perfume; perfumesextracted every flower butterfly-land, far moreflowers could count Christmas, must allowthere plenty variety dishes." "Um-m," said Griselda; "I suppose is. But same, cuckoo,it good thing I hungry, it? May I pour scent onmy pocket-handkerchief comes round me? I myhandkerchief here, see. Is nice I brought it? It wasunder pillow, I wrapped round hand open shutter, forthe hook scratched once." "You may pour one drop handkerchief," said cuckoo, "but notmore. I like butterflies think greedy." But Griselda grew tired scent feast long thepetals passed round. The perfumes nice, certainly,but quantities them--double quantities honour ofthe guest, course! Griselda screwed handkerchief tightlittle ball, one drop scent escape it,and kept sniffing impatiently, till last cuckooasked matter. "I tired feast," said. "Do let us something else,cuckoo." "It getting rather late," said cuckoo. "But see, Griselda, theyare going air-dance now." "What that?" said Griselda. "Look, see," replied. Flocks flocks butterflies rising short way air,and arranging bands according colours. "Come bank," said cuckoo Griselda; "you see thembetter." Griselda climbed bank, could look onthe butterfly show, saw beautifully. The long strings ofbutterflies twisted wonderful way,like ribbons every hue plaiting instantunplaiting again. Then king queen placed themselvesin centre, round round moving circles twisted anduntwisted brilliant bands butterflies. "It like kaleidoscope," said Griselda; "and like thosetwisty-twirly dissolving views papa took see once. It's_just_ like them. Oh, pretty! Cuckoo, onpurpose please me?" "A good deal," said cuckoo. "Stand clap hands loud threetimes, show pleased." Griselda obeyed. "Clap" number one--all butterflies rose theair cloud; clap number two--they fluttered twirled andbuzzed about, greatest excitement; clap number three--theyall turned Griselda's direction rush. "They going kiss you, Griselda," cried cuckoo. Griselda felt breath going. Up vast feathery cloudof butterflies, fluttering, _rushing_ upon her. "Cuckoo, cuckoo," screamed, "they suffocate me. Oh, cuckoo!" "Shut eyes, clap hands loud, loud," called thecuckoo. And Griselda clapped hands, holding precioushandkerchief teeth, heard give usual cry,"Cuckoo, cuckoo." _Clap_--where all? Griselda opened eyes--garden, butterflies, cuckoo, haddisappeared. She bed, Dorcas knocking door withthe hot water. "Miss Grizzel said I wake usual time morning,missie," said. "I hope feel tired get up." "Tired! I think not," replied Griselda. "I awake morningages you, I tell you, dear Dorcas. Come minute,Dorcas, please," went on. "There now, sniff handkerchief. What doyou think that?" "It beautiful," said Dorcas. "It big blue chinay bottleon auntie's table, it, missie?" "Stuff nonsense," replied Griselda; "it scent own, Dorcas.Aunt Grizzel never like life. There now! Please giveme slippers, I want get look lessons Mr.Kneebreeches comes. Dear me," added herself, wasputting slippers, "how pretty feet look bluebutterfly shoes! It good cuckoo take there, Idon't think I shall ever wish butterfly again, I know howhard work! But I would like lessons well to-day. I fancy it'llplease dear old cuckoo." VIII MASTER PHIL "Who comes world flowers?Daisy crocus, sea-blue bell,And violet shrinking dewy cell--Sly cells know secrets night,When earth bathed fairy light--Scarlet, blue, golden flowers." And Mr. Kneebreeches reason complain pupil day. And Miss Grizzel congratulated heartily ever herwise management children. And Miss Tabitha repeated Sister Grizzel might indeed congratulateherself. And Griselda became gradually convinced wayas yet discovered getting hard tasks set work dothem; also, grumbling, things present arranged thisworld, _always_, I may say _often_, good; furthermore,that ill-tempered child not, whole, likely muchloved good-tempered one; lastly, wait long enough,winter go spring come. For case year, all! Spring sleepyand lazy, case could poor old winter fill thevacant post till came? Why scolded reviled forfaithfully best, often is, I really know. Not thatall ill words gets much effect him--he comes justas usual, whatever say him. I suppose feelings longago frozen up, surely would takenoffence--well us done so! But spring come last year, would impossiblefor tell Griselda enjoyed it. It like new life heras well plants, flowers, birds, insects. Hitherto,you see, able see little outside heraunt's house; charming inside was, outside, I must say,was still "charminger." There seemed end little up-and-downpaths alleys, leading rustic seats quaint arbours; limitsto little pine-wood, led dearest littlezig-zaggy path ever saw, bordered snow-drops primrosesand violets, later periwinkles, wood anemones, thosebright, starry, white flowers, whose name two people agree about. This wood-path place, I think, Griselda loved best.The bowling-green certainly delightful, terracewhere famous roses grew; lovely roses (I speakingjust now, course, later summer, inbloom), Griselda could enjoy much wild-flowers, forshe forbidden gather touch them, except funny roundnose! "You may _scent_ them, dear," said Miss Grizzel, opinionthat smell pretty word; "but I cannot allow anything more." And Griselda "scent" them, I assure you. She burrowed whole rosyface big ones; gently, want spoil them,both aunt's sake, because, too, greater regard forflowers knew secret painted, whata great deal trouble butterflies take them. But one grows tired "scenting" roses; even thetrying walk straight across bowling-green eyes shut,from arbour one side arbour exactly like other,grew stupid, though doubt would capital fun acompanion applaud criticize. So wood-path became Griselda's favourite haunt. As summer grewon, began long ever companion--not much forplay, one play with. She lessons, course, asmany winter; long days, seemed come aquite unaccountable increase play-time, Griselda sometimes foundit hang heavy hands. She seen heard anything thecuckoo either, save, course, "official capacity" oftime-teller, long time. "I suppose," thought, "he thinks I need amusing, thefine days come I play garden; certainly, I had_any one_ play with, garden would perfectly lovely." But, failing companions, best could herself, andthis loved path wood much. There asort mystery it; might path leading thecottage Red-Ridinghood's grandmother, path leading fairylanditself. There kinds queer, nice, funny noises heardthere--in one part especially, Griselda made seatof moss-grown stones, came often got toknow little flowers growing close round about, even theparticular birds whose nests hard by. She used sit _fancy_--fancy heard wood-elveschattering breath, little underground gnomes andkobolds hammering fairy forges. And tinkling brookin distance sounded like enchanted bells round necks thefairy kine, sent pasture sometimes upper worldhillsides. For Griselda's head crammed full, perfectly full, offairy lore; mandarins' country, butterfly-land, quiteas real every-day world her. But time forgotten cuckoo, see. One day sitting favourite nest, feeling, notwithstandingthe sunshine, flowers, soft sweet air, pleasantsounds about, rather dull lonely. For though May, itwas really quite hot day, Griselda morning herlessons, tried hard, done well, shefelt deserved reward. Suddenly distance, hearda well-known sound, "Cuckoo, cuckoo." "Can cuckoo?" said herself; moment feltsure must be. For, reason I know enoughabout habits real "flesh blood" cuckoos explain, birdwas known neighbourhood Griselda's aunts lived. Sometwenty miles south heard regularly, thisspring Griselda never caught sound familiar note, shenow remembered hearing never came parts. So, "it must cuckoo," said herself. "He must coming outto speak me. How funny! I never seen daylight." She listened. Yes, was, "Cuckoo, cuckoo," plain aspossible, nearer before. "Cuckoo," cried Griselda, "do come talk me. It long timesince I seen you, I nobody play with." But answer. Griselda held breath listen, therewas nothing heard. "Unkind cuckoo!" exclaimed. "He tricking me, I believe; andto-day too, I dull lonely." The tears came eyes, beginning think herselfvery badly used, suddenly rustling bushes beside madeher turn round, half expecting see cuckoo himself. Butit he. The rustling went minute two without anythingmaking appearance, bushes pretty thick there, andany one scrambling pine-wood would ratherhard work get through, indeed big person featwould altogether impossible. It big person, however, causing rustling,and crunching branches, general commotion, absorbedGriselda's attention. She sat watching another minute perfectstillness, afraid startling slightest movement squirrel orrabbit creature kind expected see. At last--wasthat squirrel rabbit--that rosy, round face, shaggy, fair hairfalling eager blue eyes, general look breathlessnessand over-heatedness determination? A squirrel rabbit! No, indeed, sturdy, merry, veryragged little boy. "Where cuckoo? Does _you_ know?" first words heuttered, soon fairly shaken himself, though anymeans clothes, free bushes (for ever many pieces ofjacket knickerbockers, speak one boot half hat,had left behind way), found breath say something. Griselda stared moment without speaking, soastonished. It months since spoken child, almost sinceshe seen one, children younger knew verylittle time, baby family home, see, andhaving big brothers older play-fellows. "Who you?" said last. "What name, youwant?" "My name's Master Phil, I want cuckoo," answered littleboy. "He camed way. I sure did, called theway." "He here," said Griselda, shaking head; "and aunts'garden. No one allowed come friends theirs. You hadbetter go home; torn clothes so." "This garden," replied little fellow undauntedly, lookinground him; "this wood. There blue-bells primroses here,and shows garden--not anybody's garden, I mean, withwalls round, nobody come in." "But _is_," said Griselda, getting rather vexed. "If agarden _grounds_, private grounds, nobody come withoutleave. This path leads wood, door wallat bottom get lane. You may go way, littleboy. No one comes scrambling way did." "But I want find cuckoo," said little boy. "I want tofind cuckoo." His voice sounded almost going cry, pretty,hot, flushed face puckered up. Griselda's heart smote her; looked athim carefully. He little boy, all; didnot like cross him. "How old you?" asked. "Five bit. I birthday summer, I good,nurse says perhaps I one next summer too. Do ever havebirthdays?" went on, peering Griselda. "Nurse says used towhen young, never now." "_Have_ nurse?" asked Griselda, rather surprised; for, tell thetruth, "Master Phil's" appearance, felt surewhat _sort_ little boy was, rather sort people hebelonged to. "Of course I nurse, mother too," said little boy,opening wide eyes surprise question. "Have you? Perhapsyou're big, though. People leave nurses mothers whenthey're big, they? Just like birthdays. But _I_ not. I won'tnever leave mother, way. I care much aboutnurse birthdays, _kite_ much. Did care toleave off, got big?" "I leave I got big," said Griselda sadly. "I leftoff I much littler you," went on, unconsciouslyspeaking Phil would best understand her. "My mother died." "I werry sorry," said Phil; way said quiteovercame Griselda's unfriendliness. "But perhaps nice nurse. Mynurse rather nice; _will_ 'cold to-day, she?" headded, laughing, pointing terrible rents garments. "Theseare oldestest things; good thing, it? Nurse saysI look like Master Phil these, I bluewelpet, I look like Master Phil. I shall blue welpet whenmother comes." "Is mother away?" said Griselda. "Oh yes, away long time; nurse came take care ofme farm-house, know. Mother ill, better now,and day come too." "Do like farm-house? Have anybody play with?"said Griselda. Phil shook curly head. "I never anybody play with," said."I would like play big. And think youcould help find cuckoo?" added insinuatingly. "What know cuckoo?" said Griselda. "He called me," said Phil, "he called lots times; to-day nursewas busy, I thought I would come. And know," addedmysteriously, "I believe cuckoo's fairy, I find himI'm going ask show way fairyland." "He says must find way ourselves," said Griselda, quiteforgetting speaking. "_Does_ he?" cried Phil, great excitement. "Do know him, then?and asked him? Oh, tell me." Griselda recollected herself. "You could understand," said. "Someday perhaps I tell you--I mean ever I see again." "But I may see again," said Phil, settling comfortablybeside Griselda mossy stone. "You let come, you? Ilike talk fairies, nurse understand. And thecuckoo knows you, perhaps called come play withyou." "How call you?" asked Griselda. "First," said Phil gravely, "it night. I asleep, Ihad wishing I somebody play with, I d'eamed thecuckoo--such nice d'eam. And I woke I heard calling me,and I d'eaming then. And I field calledme, I _couldn't_ find him, nurse said 'Nonsense.' And to-day hecalled again, I camed bushes. And may I comeagain? Perhaps tried together could find way tofairyland. Do think could?" "I know," said Griselda, dreamily. "There great deal learnfirst, cuckoo says." "Have learnt great deal?" (he called "a gate deal") asked Phil,looking Griselda increased respect. "_I_ know scarcelynothing. Mother ill long time went away, Iknow wanted learn read books. But nurse old teachme." "Shall I teach you?" said Griselda. "I bring old booksand teach I done lessons." "And mother _would_ surprised comes back," said MasterPhil, clapping hands. "Oh, _do_. And I learnt read agreat deal, think cuckoo would show us way fairyland?" "I think sort learning meant," said Griselda."But I dare say would help. I _think_," went on, lowering hervoice little, looking gravely Phil's earnest eyes, "I_think_ means mostly learning good--very, _very_ good, youknow." "Gooder you?" said Phil. "Oh dear, yes; lots lots gooder me," replied Griselda. "_I_ think good," observed Phil, parenthesis. Then hewent cross-questioning. "Gooder mother?" "I know mother, I tell good is?" saidGriselda. "_I_ tell you," said Phil, importantly. "She good as--asgood as--as good _good_. That is." "You mean could better," said Griselda, smiling. "Yes, do, like. Would good enough us be,do think?" "We must ask cuckoo," said Griselda. "But I sure would agood thing learn read. You must ask nurse let youcome every afternoon fine, I ask aunt." "I need ask nurse," said Phil composedly; "she never know Iam, I need tell her. She care I do, except tearingmy clothes; scolds me, _I_ care." "_That_ good, Phil," said Griselda gravely. "You never asgood good speak like that." "What I say, then? Tell me," said little boy submissively. "You ask nurse let come play me, tell I'mmuch bigger you, I let tear clothes. And youshould tell sorry torn to-day." "Very well," said Phil, "I say that. But, oh see!" exclaimed,darting off, "there field mouse! If I could catch him!" Of course could catch him, could Griselda either; ready,though, best. But great fun same, andthe children laughed heartily enjoyed tremendously. Andwhen tired sat gathered flowers fornosegays, Griselda surprised find clever Phil aboutit. He much quicker spying prettiest blossoms,however hidden behind tree, stone, shrub. And told allthe best places flowers near by, grew largestprimroses sweetest violets, way astonished her. "You little boy," said; "how know much aboutflowers?" "I one else play with," said innocently. "And then, youknow, fairies fond them." When Griselda thought time go home, led little Phil downthe wood-path, door wall opening lane. "Now find way home without scrambling morebushes, cannot you, Master Phil?" said. "Yes, thank you, I come place to-morrow afternoon,shall I?" asked Phil. "I know when--after I dinner andraced three times round big field, time. That itwas to-day." "I think would _walked_ three times--or twice youlike--round field. It good thing race you'vehad dinner," observed Griselda sagely. "And must try comeif fine, aunts let go rains even thetiniest bit. And course must ask nurse's leave." "Very well," said little Phil trotted off. "I try rememberall things. I glad play again; seethe cuckoo, please thank him." IX UP AND DOWN THE CHIMNEY "_Helper._ Well, dream, would asif real, would not? _Keeper._ Yes, I see. I mean, Sir, I _not_ see."--_A LiliputRevel._ _Not_ "just dinner," feeling much inclined forher tea, Griselda ran home great rate. She felt, too, good spirits; delightful acompanion play. "What good thing I make Phil run away I found outwhat nice little boy was," said herself. "I must look myold reading books to-night. I shall like teaching him, poor littleboy, cuckoo pleased something useful, I'msure." Tea quite ready, fact waiting her, came in. This wasa meal always herself, brought tray Dorcas'slittle sitting-room, Dorcas waited upon her. And sometimes whenGriselda particularly good humour would beg Dorcas sitdown cup tea her--a liberty old servant fartoo dignified respectful thought taking, unless speciallyrequested so. This evening, know, Griselda particularly goodhumour, besides this, full adventures, wouldhave glad even less sympathising listener Dorcas waslikely be. "Sit down, Dorcas, tea, do," said coaxingly. "Itlooks ever much comfortable, I sure could eat alittle tried, whether tea kitchen ornot. I _fearfully_ hungry, I tell you. You cut wholelot bread butter 'ladies' slices' either." "How tongue go, sure, Miss Griselda," said Dorcas,smiling, seated chair Griselda drawn forher. "And it?" said Griselda saucily. "It anyharm. But oh, Dorcas, I fun afternoon--really, youcouldn't guess I doing." "Very likely not, missie," said Dorcas. "But might try guess. Oh no, I think need--guessingtakes time, I want tell you. Just fancy, Dorcas, I beenplaying little boy wood." "Playing little boy, Miss Griselda!" exclaimed Dorcas, aghast. "Yes, coming to-morrow, day after, everyday, I dare say," said Griselda. "He _is_ nice little boy." "But, missie," began Dorcas. "Well? What matter? You need look like that--as I donesomething naughty," said Griselda sharply. "But tell aunt, missie?" "Of course," said Griselda, looking fearlessly Dorcas's facewith bright grey eyes. "Of course; I? I must ask herto give little boy leave come _our_ grounds; I told thelittle boy sure tell nurse, takes care him, abouthis playing me." "His nurse," repeated Dorcas, tone relief. "Then must bequite little boy, perhaps Miss Grizzel would object much inthat case." "Why object all? She might know I would want playwith naughty rude boy," said Griselda. "She thinks boys rude naughty, I afraid, missie," saidDorcas. "All, say, excepting dear papa. But then, ofcourse, bringing _him_ way thebeginning." "Well, I ask her, way," said Griselda, "and says I notto play him, I shall think--I know I shall _think_ AuntGrizzel, whether I _say_ not." And old look rebellion discontent settled herrosy face. "Be careful, missie, do, dear good girl," said Dorcasanxiously, hour later, Griselda, dressed usual littlewhite muslin frock, ready join aunts dessert. But Griselda would condescend make reply. "Aunt Grizzel," said suddenly, eaten orange andthree biscuits drunk half glass home-made elder-berry wine,"Aunt Grizzel, I garden to-day--down wood-path,I mean--I met little boy, played me, I want knowif may come every day play me." Griselda knew making request amiable orbecoming manner; knew, indeed, making wayas almost certain lead refused; yet, though shewas really very, anxious get leave play little Phil,she took sort spiteful pleasure injuring because. How _foolish_ ill-temper makes us! Griselda allowed getso angry _thought_ thwarted aunt looked upquietly said once, "Oh yes, may little boy playwith whenever like," would really, strange distortedsort way, _disappointed_. But, course, Miss Grizzel made reply. Nothing less amiracle could made answer Griselda otherwise did.Like Dorcas, instant, utterly "flabbergasted," youknow means. For really quite old lady, know,and sensible was, things upset much easily shewas younger. Naughty Griselda saw uneasiness, enjoyed it. "Playing boy!" exclaimed Miss Grizzel. "A boy grounds, andyou, niece, played him!" "Yes," said Griselda coolly, "and I want play again." "Griselda," said aunt, "I astonished say present.Go bed." "Why I go bed? It bedtime," cried Griselda, blazingup. "What I done sent bed I disgrace?" "Go bed," repeated Miss Grizzel. "I speak to-morrow." "You unfair unjust," said Griselda, starting herchair. "That good honest telling everything. Imight played little boy every day month youwould never known, I told you." She banged across room spoke, door, slammingit behind rudely. Then upstairs like whirlwind; gotto room, sat floor burst tears, andwhen Dorcas came up, nearly half hour later, still thesame place, crouched little heap, sobbing bitterly. "Oh, missie, missie," said Dorcas, "it I afraid of!" As Griselda rushed room Miss Grizzel leant back chairand sighed deeply. "Already," said faintly. "She never violent before. Can oneafternoon's companionship rudeness already contaminated her?Already, Tabitha--can so?" "Already," said Miss Tabitha, softly shaking head, somehowmade look wonderfully like old cat, felt cold anevening usually wore fine woolly shawl delicate greyshade, borders cap ruffles round throat andwrists fluffy, downy white--"already," said. "Yet," said Miss Grizzel, recovering little, "it true whatthe child said. She might deceived us. Have I hard upon her,Sister Tabitha?" "Hard upon her! Sister Grizzel," said Miss Tabitha energy thanusual; "no, certainly not. For once, Sister Grizzel, I disagree withyou. Hard upon her! Certainly not." But Miss Grizzel feel happy. When went room night surprised findDorcas waiting her, instead younger maid. "I thought would mind me, instead Martha, to-night,madam," said, "for I want speak MissGriselda. The poor, dear young lady gone bed unhappy." "But know done, Dorcas?" said Miss Grizzel."Admitted _boy_, rude, common, impertinent _boy_, precincts,and played him--with _boy_, Dorcas." "Yes, madam," said Dorcas. "I know it, madam. Miss Griseldahas told all. But would allow give opinion, isn'tquite bad. He quite little boy, madam--between five six--onlyjust age Miss Griselda's dear papa first came tous, and, I hear, quite little gentleman." "A little gentleman," repeated Miss Grizzel, "and six years old!That less objectionable I expected. What name, youknow much, Dorcas?" "Master Phil," replied Dorcas. "That told Miss Griselda, andshe never thought ask more. But I tell could get tohear him, I think, madam. From Miss Griselda says, Ibelieve staying Mr. Crouch's farm, that, know, madam,belongs Lady Lavander, though good way MerrybrowHall. My lady pretty sure know child, knows allthat goes among tenants, I remember hearing littlegentleman nurse come Mr. Crouch's lodge sixmonths." Miss Grizzel listened attentively. "Thank you, Dorcas," said, old servant left offspeaking. "You behaved usual discretion. I shall driveover Merrybrow to-morrow, make inquiry. And may tell MissGriselda morning I purpose doing; tell also that, asa punishment rudeness ill-temper, must breakfast inher room to-morrow, see till I send her. Had sherestrained temper explained matter, distress mighthave saved." Dorcas wait till "to-morrow morning"; could bear tothink Griselda's unhappiness. From mistress's room wentstraight little girl's, going softly, todisturb sleeping. "Are awake, missie?" said gently. Griselda started up. "Yes," exclaimed. "Is you, cuckoo? I quite awake." "Bless child," said Dorcas herself, "how head run onMiss Sybilla's cuckoo. It really wonderful. There suchthings people think." But aloud replied-- "It Dorcas, missie. No fairy, old Dorcas come comfort abit. Listen, missie. Your auntie going Merrybrow Hallto-morrow inquire little Master Phil LadyLavander, think one ladyship's farms andhis nurse staying, hears nice-mannered littlegentleman, comes good parents--why, missie, sayingbut get leave play much like." "But to-morrow, Dorcas," said Griselda. "Aunt Grizzel never goes toMerrybrow till afternoon. She back time playwith Phil to-morrow." "No, next day, perhaps," said Dorcas. "Oh, do," said Griselda, beginning cry again. "Poorlittle Phil coming wood-path _to-morrow_, hedoesn't find me, _so_ unhappy--perhaps never come againif I meet to-morrow." Dorcas saw little girl worn excited, yetinclined take reasonable view things. "Go sleep, missie," said kindly, "and think anything moreabout till to-morrow. It right, see." Her patience touched Griselda. "You kind, Dorcas," said. "I mean cross to_you_; I cannot bear think poor little Phil. Perhaps sitdown mossy stone cry. Poor little Phil!" But notwithstanding distress, Dorcas left feelher heart little lighter, somehow long fellasleep. When awoke seemed suddenly, feeling thatsomething disturbed her. She lay minute two perfectlystill--listening. Yes; was--the soft, faint rustle airthat knew well. It seemed something moving away fromher. "Cuckoo," said gently, "is you?" A moment's pause, came answer--the pretty greeting sheexpected. "Cuckoo, cuckoo," soft musical. Then cuckoo spoke. "Well, Griselda" said, "and you? It good since wehave fun together." "That _my_ fault," said Griselda sharply. She yet feelingquite amiable might desired, see. "That's_certainly_ fault," repeated. "I never said was," replied cuckoo. "Why jump atconclusions so? It bad habit, often jump _over_them, see, go far. One always _walk_ toconclusions, slowly evenly, right foot first, left, onewith another--that way get want go, feel sureof ground. Do see?" "I know whether I not, I going speak ifyou go like that. You might see I want lecturedwhen I unhappy." "What unhappy about?" "About Phil, course. I tell you, I believe know," saidGriselda. "Was sent play me? I sopleased, I thought kind you; spoiltnow." "But I heard Dorcas saying aunt going consult myLady Lavander it," said cuckoo. "It right; youneedn't low spirits nothing." "Were room _then_?" said Griselda. "How funny are,cuckoo. But right. Do see, poor little Phil becoming wood-path to-morrow afternoon meet me, I bethere! I cannot bear think it." "Is all?" said cuckoo. "It really extraordinary somepeople make troubles nothing! We easily tell Phil cometill day after. Come along." "Come along," repeated Griselda; "what mean?" "Oh, I forgot," said cuckoo. "You understand. Put yourhand. There, feel me?" "Yes," said Griselda, stroking gently soft feathers seemed tobe close hand. "Yes, I feel you." "Well, then," said cuckoo, "put arms round neck, hold mefirm. I lift up." "How _can_ talk nonsense, cuckoo?" said Griselda. "Why, one ofmy little fingers would clasp neck. How I put arms roundit?" "Try," said cuckoo. Somehow Griselda try. She held arms cuckoo's direction, expected hisneck size Shetland pony's, large Newfoundlanddog's; and, astonishment, was! A nice, comfortable,feathery neck felt--so soft could help laying headdown upon it, nestling downy cushion. "That right," said cuckoo. Then seemed give little spring, Griselda felt herselfaltogether lifted back. She lay comfortably aspossible--it felt firm well soft. Up flew little way--thenstopped short. "Are right?" inquired. "You afraid falling off?" "Oh no," said Griselda; "not bit." "You need be," said cuckoo, "for could tried. I'mgoing on, then." "Where to?" said Griselda. "Up chimney first," said cuckoo. "But never room," said Griselda. "I might _perhaps_ crawl uplike sweep, hands knees, know, like going ladder. Butstretched like this--it I lying sofa--I_couldn't_ go chimney." "Could you?" said cuckoo. "We see. _I_ intend go, way,and take me. Shut eyes--one, two, three--heregoes--we chimney know." It quite true. Griselda shut eyes tight. She felt nothing apleasant sort rush. Then heard cuckoo's voice, saying-- "Well, well done? Open eyes look you." Griselda so. Where they? They floating top house, Griselda sawdown them, looking dark vast. She felt confused andbewildered. "Cuckoo," said, "I understand. Is I grown little,or grown big?" "Whichever please," said cuckoo. "You forgotten. I told youlong ago matter fancy." "Yes, everything grew little _together_," persisted Griselda; "but itisn't everything. It me, us. No, cannot beboth us. And I think me, grownlittle would, eyes grown little, everything looksas big usual, _you_ great deal bigger. My eyes cannot havegrown bigger without rest me, surely, moon looks thesame. And I must grown little, else could got thechimney. Oh, cuckoo, put thinking muddle!" "Never mind," said cuckoo. "It show little consequencebig little of. Make comfortable same. Are youall right? Shut eyes like. I going pretty fast." "Where to?" said Griselda. "To Phil, course," said cuckoo. "What bad memory have! Areyou comfortable?" "_Very_, thank you," replied Griselda, giving cuckoo's neck anaffectionate hug spoke. "That do, thank you. Do throttle me, quite toyou," said cuckoo. "Here goes--one, two, three," flewagain. Griselda shut eyes lay still. It delicious--the gliding, yetdarting motion, like nothing ever felt before. It makeher least giddy, either; slightly sleepy feeling came overher. She felt inclination open eyes; and, indeed, ratethey going, could distinguished little doneso. Suddenly feeling air changed. For instant itfelt _rushy_ before, queer, dull sound herears. Then felt cuckoo stopped. "Where we?" asked. "We come _down_ chimney again," said cuckoo. "Open youreyes clamber back, speak loud, wakenhim, would do. There are--the moonlight's coming innicely window--you see way." Griselda found little bed-room, quite tiny one, bythe look simple furniture latticed window, saw thatshe grand house. But everything looked neat nice,and little bed one corner lay lovely sleeping child. It wasPhil! He looked pretty asleep--his shaggy curls tumbling about,his rosy mouth half open smiling, one little hand tossed hishead, tight clasping little basket insisted ontaking bed him, meaning soon dressed nextmorning run fill flowers little girl hadmade friends with. Griselda stepped side bed tiptoe. The cuckoo haddisappeared, Griselda heard voice. It seemed come alittle way chimney. "Do wake him," said cuckoo, "but whisper want sayinto ear, soon I called him. He understand; he'saccustomed ways." Then came old note, soft musical ever-- "Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo. Listen, Phil," said cuckoo, withoutopening eyes change passed little boy's face. Griseldacould see listening hear message. "He thinks dreaming, I suppose," said smile.Then whispered softly-- "Phil, dear, come play to-morrow, I cannot come. Butcome day after. I wood-path then." "Welly well," murmured Phil. Then put two arms towardsGriselda, without opening eyes, she, bending down, kissedhim softly. "Phil's sleepy," whispered, like baby almost. Then turnedover went sleep soundly before. "That do," said cuckoo. "Come along, Griselda." Griselda obediently made way place whence cuckoo's voiceseemed come. "Shut eyes put arms round neck again," said cuckoo. She hesitate time. It happened before. Therecame sort rushy sound; cuckoo stopped, Griseldaopened eyes. They air again--a good way up, too, grand oldelms stood beside farmhouse gently waving topmostbranches yard two cuckoo poising andGriselda. "Where shall go now?" said. "Or would rather go home? Areyou tired?" "Tired!" exclaimed Griselda. "I rather think not. How could I betired, cuckoo?" "Very well, excite nothing, whatever do," saidthe cuckoo. "Say would like go." "How I?" said Griselda. "You know far nice places I do." "You care go back mandarins, butterflies, Isuppose?" asked cuckoo. "No, thank you," said Griselda; "I would like something new. And I notsure I care seeing countries kind, unless youcould take _real_ fairyland." "_I_ cannot that, know," said cuckoo. Just faint "soughing" sound among branches suggested anotheridea Griselda. "Cuckoo," exclaimed, "take sea. It _such_ time since Isaw sea. I fancy I hear it; take see it." X THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOON "That supper time come,And silver dews meadow steep,And silent home,And even nurses asleep,That late, soon,Upon lovely night JuneThey step moon." "Very well," said cuckoo. "You would like look littleon way, perhaps, Griselda, shall going chimneys,or anything kind present." "Yes," said Griselda. "I think I should. I rather tired shuttingmy eyes, I getting quite accustomed flying you,cuckoo." "Turn side, then," said cuckoo, "and twistyour neck see shoulder. Are comfortable now? And,by-the-by, may cold, feel left wing. You findthe feather mantle there, before. Wrap roundyou. I tucked last moment, thinking might want it." "Oh, dear, kind cuckoo!" cried Griselda. "Yes, I found it. I'lltuck round like rug--that it. I _am_ warm now, cuckoo." "Here goes, then," said cuckoo, set. Had ever littlegirl flight before? Floating, darting, gliding, sailing--no wordscan describe it. Griselda lay still delight, gazing her. "How lovely stars are, cuckoo!" said. "Is true allgreat, big _suns_? I would rather not. I like think asnice, funny little things." "They suns," said cuckoo. "Not lookingat now." "I like twinkling ones best," said Griselda. "They look sogood-natured. Are _all_ twirling always, cuckoo? Mr.Kneebreeches begun teach astronomy, _he_ says theyare; I sure knows much it." "He quite right same," replied cuckoo. "Oh dear me! How tired must be, then!" said Griselda. "Do theynever rest minute?" "Never." "Why not?" "Obeying orders," replied cuckoo. Griselda gave little wriggle. "What use it?" said. "It would nice theystood still then." "Would it?" said cuckoo. "I know somebody would soon find faultif did. What would say summer; day, night,whichever happened be, see; nothing growing, nothingto eat long? That would stood still, yousee, because----" "Thank you, cuckoo," interrupted Griselda. "It nice hearyou--I mean, dreadful think of, I want explain.I ask Mr. Kneebreeches I lessons. You might tell onething, however. What side moon?" "There variety opinions," said cuckoo. "What they? Tell funniest." "Some say unfinished work world kept there," said thecuckoo. "_That's_ funny," said Griselda. "What messy place must be!Why, even _my_ unfinished work makes quite heap. I like thatopinion all, cuckoo. Tell another." "I _have_ heard," said cuckoo, "that among places youwould find country little black dogs. You know sort ofcreatures are?" "Yes, I suppose so," said Griselda, rather reluctantly. "There good many world, course know,"continued cuckoo. "But there, much worse here. Whena child made great pet one here, I heard tell thefairies take parents nurses think he'ssleeping quietly bed, make work hard night, hisown particular little black dog back. And dreadfullyheavy--for every time takes back grows poundheavier there--that morning child quite worn out. I daresay noticed haggered miserable ill-tempered childrenget look--now know reason." "Thank you, cuckoo," said Griselda again; "but I cannot say I like thisopinion side moon better first. Ifyou please, I would rather talk more." "Oh, bad idea all," said cuckoo. "Lots ofchildren, say, get quite cured country little blackdogs. It way--for every time child refuses take dog onhis back grows pound lighter there, last anysensible child learns much better nothing say itat all, gets way it, see. Of course, _are_children nothing would cure, I suppose. What becomes Ireally cannot say. Very likely get crushed pancakes theweight dogs last, nothing ever heard ofthem." "Horrid!" said Griselda, shudder. "Do let us talk anymore, cuckoo; tell _own_ opinion really onthe side moon." The cuckoo silent moment. Then suddenly stopped short inthe middle flight. "Would like see yourself, Griselda?" said. "There would beabout time it," added himself, "and would fulfil herother wish, too." "See moon myself, mean?" cried Griselda, clasping herhands. "I rather think I would. Will really take there,cuckoo?" "To side," said cuckoo. "I could take thisside." "Why not? Not I would care go side much other;for, course, _see_ side here. But I would like knowwhy could take there." "For _reasons_," said cuckoo drily. "I give one like.If I took side moon would yougot there." "Who would I be, then?" "Griselda," said cuckoo, "I told greatmany things know. Now, I tell something more. There area great many things _intended_ know." "Very well," said Griselda. "But tell going again,and going take to. There harm asking that?" "No," said cuckoo. "I going immediately, I going takeyou wanted go to, must shut eyes again, andlie perfectly still without talking, I must put steam--a gooddeal steam--and I cannot talk you. Are right?" "All right," said Griselda. She hardly said words seemed fall asleep. Therushing sound air round increased greatly wasconscious nothing else. For moment two tried rememberwhere was, going, useless. She forgoteverything, knew nothing passing till--till sheheard cuckoo again. "Cuckoo, cuckoo; wake up, Griselda," said. Griselda sat up. Where she? Not certainly went sleep. Not thecuckoo's back, standing beside her, tiny usual.Either grown little again, grown big--which, shesupposed, much matter. Only queer! "Where I, cuckoo?" said. "Where wished be," replied. "Look see." Griselda looked her. What see? Something I onlygive faint idea of, children; something strange unlike whatshe ever seen before, dream could see asGriselda saw it. And yet _why_ seemed strange unnaturalI cannot well explain; I could, words would good aspictures, I know not. After all, sea saw; great, strange,silent sea, waves. Griselda seated shore,close beside water's edge, come lapping herfeet pretty, coaxing way _our_ sea goodhumour. There faint ripples surface, causedby slight breezes came softly round Griselda'sface, all. King Canute might sat "from till now"by still, lifeless ocean without chance reading sillyattendants lesson--if, indeed, ever silly people,which I much doubt. Griselda gazed eyes. Then suddenly gave littleshiver. "What matter?" said cuckoo. "You mantle on--you'renot cold?" "No," said Griselda, "I cold; somehow, cuckoo, I feel littlefrightened. The sea strange, dreadfully big; lightis queer, too. What light, cuckoo? It moonlight, it?" "Not exactly," said cuckoo. "You cannot cake eatit, Griselda. Look sky. There moon there, there?" "No," said Griselda; "but lots stars, cuckoo. The light comesfrom them, I suppose? And sun, cuckoo? Will risingsoon? It always like here, it?" "Bless you, no," said cuckoo. "There sun enough, rather toomuch, sometimes. How would like day fortnight long, nightsto match? If daytime now, I could broughtyou. It middle night now, aweek _your_ days sun begin rise, because, see----" "Oh, _dear_ cuckoo, please explain!" cried Griselda. "I promiseto ask Mr. Kneebreeches, I indeed. In fact, telling mesomething like to-day yesterday--which I say?--at myastronomy lesson. And makes strange havebrought to-night see myself, it, cuckoo?" "An odd coincidence," said cuckoo. "What _would_ Mr. Kneebreeches think I told I been?"continued Griselda. "Only, see, cuckoo, I never tell anybody aboutwhat I see I you." "No," replied cuckoo; "better not. ('Not could youtried,' added himself.) You frightened now, Griselda, areyou?" "No, I think I am," replied. "But, cuckoo, sea_awfully_ big?" "Pretty well," said cuckoo. "Just half, nearly half, size ofthe moon; and, doubt, Mr. Kneebreeches told moon'sdiameter circumference respec----" "Oh _don't_, cuckoo!" interrupted Griselda, beseechingly. "I want toenjoy myself, lessons. Tell something funny, cuckoo.Are mermaids moon-sea?" "Not exactly," said cuckoo. "What stupid way answer," said Griselda. "There sense that;there either must must be. There could half mermaids." "I know that," replied cuckoo. "They might beenhere left tails behind them, like Bopeep's sheep,you know; day might coming find again, youknow. That would 'not exactly,' would it?" "Cuckoo, laughing me," said Griselda. "Tell me, anymermaids, fairies, water-sprites, sort ofcreatures here?" "I must still say 'not exactly,'" said cuckoo. "There beingshere, rather been, may again; you,Griselda, know this." His tone rather solemn, Griselda felt little "eerie." "It dreadfully long way home, way," said. "I feel asif, I go back, I shall perhaps find I away fifty years orso, like little boy fairy story. Cuckoo, I think I would liketo go home. May I get back again?" "Presently," said cuckoo. "Do uneasy, Griselda. Perhaps I'lltake home short cut." "Was ever child before?" asked Griselda, little pause. "Yes," said cuckoo. "And get safe home again?" "Quite," said cuckoo. "It silly you, Griselda, allthese ideas still far near, big little, long andshort, I taught seen." "I sorry," said Griselda humbly; "but see, cuckoo, I can'thelp it. I suppose I made so." "Perhaps," said cuckoo, meditatively. He silent minute. Then spoke again. "Look there,Griselda," said. "There short cut." Griselda looked. Far, far sea, silent distance, sawa tiny speck light. It tiny; yet strange thing wasthat, far away appeared, minute was, seemed throwoff thread light Griselda's feet--right across greatsheet faintly gleaming water. And Griselda looked, threadseemed widen grow, becoming time brighter andclearer, till last lay like path glowing light. "Am I walk along there?" said softly cuckoo. "No," replied; "wait." Griselda waited, looking still, presently middle theshining streak saw something slowly moving--something whichthe light came, nearer got shorter grew theglowing path, behind moving object sea looked brighterthan appeared. At last--at last, came quite near--near enough Griselda todistinguish clearly was. It little boat--the prettiest, loveliest little boat everwas seen; rowed little figure first sightGriselda felt certain fairy. For child bright hairand silvery wings, every movement sparkled shone like athousand diamonds. Griselda sprang clapped hands delight. At sound, thechild boat turned looked her. For one instant couldnot remember seen before; exclaimed,joyfully-- "It Phil! Oh, cuckoo, Phil. Have turned fairy,Phil?" But, alas, spoke light faded away, boy's figuredisappeared, sea shore sky beenbefore, lighted faint, strange gleaming stars. Onlythe boat remained. Griselda saw close her, shallow water, afew feet stood. "Cuckoo," exclaimed tone reproach disappointment, "whereis Phil gone? Why send away?" "I send away," said cuckoo. "You understand. Nevermind, get boat. It right, see." "But go away leave Phil here, alone sideof moon?" said Griselda, feeling ready cry. "Oh, silly girl!" said cuckoo. "Phil's right, someways great deal sense you, I tell you. Get intothe boat make comfortable; lie bottom andcover mantle. You need afraid wettingyour feet little, moon water never gives cold. There, now." Griselda told. She beginning feel rather tired,and certainly comfortable bottom boat, withthe nice warm feather-mantle well tucked round her. "Who row?" said sleepily. "_You_ cannot, cuckoo, tinylittle claws, could never hold oars, I am----" "Hush!" said cuckoo; whether rowed Griselda neverknew. Off glided somehow, seemed Griselda _somebody_rowed, heard soft dip, dip oars went along,so regularly could help beginning count time--one,two, three, four--on, on--she thought got nearly hundred,when---- XI "CUCKOO, CUCKOO, GOOD-BYE!" "Children, try good!That end teaching;Easily understood,And easy preaching.And find hard,Your efforts need double;Nothing deserves rewardUnless given us trouble." When forgot everything, fell fast, fast asleep, wake, ofcourse, little bed usual! "One tricks again, Mr. Cuckoo," said asmile. "However, I mind. It _was_ short cut home, wasvery comfortable boat, I certainly saw great deal lastnight, I much obliged you--particularly making allright Phil coming play to-day. Ah! thatreminds me, I disgrace. I wonder Aunt Grizzel really makeme stay room day. How tired I shall be, Mr.Kneebreeches think! But serves right. I _was_ cross andrude." There came tap door. It Dorcas hot water. "Good morning, missie," said gently, feeling, tell truth,very sure sort humour "missie" likely found inthis morning. "I hope slept well." "Exceedingly well, thank you, Dorcas. I delightful night,"replied Griselda amiably, smiling thought whatDorcas would say knew been, beendoing since last saw her. "That good news," said Dorcas tone relief; "and I good newsfor you, too, missie. At least, I hope think so. Your aunt hasordered carriage quite early morning--so see reallywants please you, missie, playing little Master Phil; andif to-morrow's fine day, sure find way letting himknow come." "Thank you, Dorcas. I hope right, Lady Lavanderwon't say anything it. I dare say not. I feel ever muchhappier morning, Dorcas; I sorry I rude AuntGrizzel, course I know I _should_ obey her." "That right, missie," said Dorcas approvingly. "It seems me, Dorcas," said Griselda dreamily, when, minuteslater, standing window old servant brushed outher thick, wavy hair, "it seems me, Dorcas, _all_ 'obeyingorders' together. There sun now, getting up, moonjust going bed--_they_ always obeying, they? I wonder whyit hard people--for children, least." "To sure, missie, put way own," replied Dorcas,somewhat mystified; "but I see mean, I think, quitetrue. And _is_ hard lesson learn." "I want learn _well_, Dorcas," said Griselda, resolutely. "So willyou please tell Aunt Grizzel I sorry last night, andI'll likes staying room anything. But, ifshe _would_ let me, I would far rather go lessons usualfor Mr. Kneebreeches. I ask go garden; I wouldlike please Aunt Grizzel lessons _very_ well." Dorcas delighted astonished. Never known little"missie" altogether submissive reasonable. "I hope child's going ill," said herself. Butshe proved skilful ambassadress, notwithstanding misgivings; andGriselda's imprisonment confined bounds house andterrace walk, instead within four walls little room,as feared. Lessons _were_ well done day, Mr. Kneebreeches' report wasall could wished. "I particularly gratified," remarked Miss Grizzel, "by theintelligence interest Miss Griselda displays regard thestudy astronomy, I recently begun give someelementary instruction in. And, indeed, I fault find theway young lady's tasks performed." "I extremely glad hear it," replied Miss Grizzel graciously, andthe kiss answered Griselda's request forgiveness wasa hearty one. And "all right" Phil. Lady Lavander knew him; father mother friends ofhers, great regard, time beenintending ask little boy spend day Merrybrow Hall, tobe introduced god-daughter Griselda. So, _of course_, LadyLavander knew him, could objection playingin Miss Grizzel's garden! And "to-morrow" turned fine day. So altogether imaginethat Griselda felt happy light-hearted ran thewood-path meet little friend, whose rosy face soon appeared amongthe bushes. "What yesterday, Phil?" asked Griselda. "Were sorry notto come play me?" "No," said Phil mysteriously, "I mind. I looking wayto fairyland show you, I believe I found it. Oh, _is_such pretty way." Griselda smiled. "I afraid way fairyland easily found," said. "ButI'd like hear went. Was far?" "A good way," said Phil. "Will come me? It wood. Ican show quite well, back tea-time." "Very well," said Griselda; set. Whether way fairyland not, wondered atthat little Phil thought so. He led Griselda right across wood apart never before. It pretty rough work part ofthe way. The children fight brambles bushes, hereand creep hands knees, Griselda toremind Phil several times promise nurse clothesshould worse playing her, prevent hisscrambling "anyhow" leaving bits knickerbockersbehind him. But last reached Phil's favourite spot troubleswere forgotten. Oh, pretty was! It sort tiny glade inthe middle wood--a little green nest enclosed round bytrees, right merry brook came rippling along ifrejoicing getting sunlight while. And allthe choicest sweetest early summer flowers seemed becollected greater variety profusion partof wood. "_Isn't_ nice?" said Phil, nestled beside Griselda thesoft, mossy grass. "It must fairies' garden time, I'msure, I wonder one doors fairyland ishidden somewhere here, could find it." "If only!" said Griselda. "I think shall find it, Phil; but,any way, lovely place found, I would like come herevery often." Then Phil's suggestion set work make housein centre fairies' garden, called it. They managed itvery much satisfaction, dragging logs wood andbig stones among brushwood hard by, filling holes upwith bracken furze. "And fairies _do_ come here," said Phil, "they pleasedto find house ready, they?" Then gather flowers ornament house inside, dryleaves twigs ready fire one corner. Altogether wasquite business, I assure you, finished werevery hot tired _rather_ dirty. Suddenly thought struckGriselda. "Phil," said, "it must getting late." "Past tea-time?" said coolly. "I dare say is. Look low sun got. Come, Phil, wemust quick. Where place came wood at?" "Here," said Phil, diving little opening among bushes. Griselda followed him. He good guide hitherto, shecertainly could found way alone. They scrambled someway, bushes suddenly seemed grow less thick, minutethey came upon little path. "Phil," said Griselda, "this way came." "Is it?" said Phil, looking him. "Then must comed thewrong way." "I afraid so," said Griselda, "and seems late already. I'mso sorry, Aunt Grizzel vexed, I want pleaseher. Will nurse vexed, Phil?" "I care are," replied Phil valiantly. "You say that, Phil. You know _shouldn't_ stayed solong playing." "Nebber mind," said Phil. "If mother I would mind. Mother's sogood, know. And never 'colds me, except I _am_naughty--so I _do_ mind." "She would like late, I sure," said Griselda indistress, "and fault, I biggest. Now, way_shall_ go?" They followed little path till came point tworoads, rough cart-ruts only, met; or, rather, path ran acrossthe road. Right, left, straight on, be? Griseldastood still perplexity. Already growing dusk; already themoon's soft light beginning faintly glimmer branches.Griselda looked sky. "To think," said herself--"to think I know wayin little bit wood like this--I side ofthe moon last night." The remembrance put another thought mind. "Cuckoo, cuckoo," said softly, "could help us?" Then stood still listened, holding Phil's cold little hands inher own. She disappointed. Presently, distance, came thewell-known cry, "cuckoo, cuckoo," soft far away, yet soclear. Phil clapped hands. "He calling us," cried joyfully. "He going show us way.That calls always. Good cuckoo, coming;" and, pullingGriselda along, darted road right--the direction fromwhence came cry. They way go, wandered far wrong direction,but cuckoo never failed them. Whenever loss--wheneverthe path turned divided, heard clear, sweet call; and,without least misgiving, followed it, till last broughtthem upon high-road, stone's throw Farmer Crouch's gate. "I know way now, good cuckoo," exclaimed Phil. "I go home alonenow, aunt vexed you." "No," said Griselda, "I must take quite way home, Phil dear.I promised take care you, nurse scolds one must beme, you." There little bustle door farm-house thechildren wearily came it. Two three men standing togetherreceiving directions Mr. Crouch himself, Phil's nurse wastalking eagerly. Suddenly caught sight truants. "Here is, Mr. Crouch!" exclaimed. "No need send lookfor him. Oh, Master Phil, could stay late? And to-nightof nights, your----I forgot, I must say. Come theparlour once--and little girl, she?" "She little girl, young lady," said Master Phil, puttingon lordly air, "and come parlour somesupper me, one must take home auntie'shouse--that I say." More please Phil wish "supper," reallyin fidget get home, Griselda let little boy lead theparlour. But moment perfectly startled cry thatbroke opened door looked room. A ladywas standing there, gazing window, though quicklygrowing darkness could hardly distinguished little figureshe watching anxiously. The noise door opening made look round. "Phil," cried, "my little Phil; to? Youdidn't know I waiting you, you?" "Mother, mother!" shouted Phil, darting mother's arms. But Griselda drew back shadow doorway, tears filledher eyes minute two listened cooings andcaressings mother son. Only minute, however. Then Phil called her. "Mother, mother," cried again, "you must kiss Griselda, too! She'sthe little girl kind, plays me; nomother," added lower tone. The lady put arm round Griselda, kissed her, too. She notseem surprised. "I think I know Griselda," said kindly, looking herface gentle eyes, blue clear like Phil's. And Griselda found courage say uneasy theanxiety aunts would feeling, messenger sent onceto tell safe farm. But Griselda kind lady would let go till hadsome nice supper Phil, warmed rested. "And about, children, lose way?" askedpresently. "I took Griselda see place I thought way fairyland,and stayed build house fairies, case come,and came wrong side, got dark," explainedPhil. "And _was_ way fairyland?" asked mother, smiling. Griselda shook head replied-- "Phil understand yet," said gently. "He old enough.The way true fairyland hard find, must find itfor ourselves, must we?" She looked lady's face spoke, saw _she_understood. "Yes, dear child," answered softly, perhaps little sadly."But Phil may help other, I perhaps may help both." Griselda slid hand lady's. "You going take Philaway, you?" whispered. "No, I come stay here," answered; "and Phil's father iscoming too, soon. We going live White House--the house onthe side wood, way Merrybrow. Are glad,children?" * * * * * Griselda curious dream night--merely dream, nothing else.She dreamt cuckoo came more; time, told her, tosay "good-bye." "For need now," said. "I leave good hands,Griselda. You friends understand you--friends willhelp work play. Better friends mandarins, orthe butterflies, even faithful old cuckoo." And Griselda tried speak him, thank goodness,to beg still sometimes come see her, gently fluttered away."Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo," warbled; somehow last "cuckoo"sounded like "good-bye." In morning, Griselda awoke, pillow wet tears.Thus many stories end. She happy, happy thought herkind new friends; tears one felt saidfarewell to, even though cuckoo clock. THE CASTLE IN THE LOUGH THE CASTLE IN THE LOUGH A LEGEND OF DONEGAL "Father," little Dermot would say, "tell something thecastle lough." Dermot M'Swyne little lad, blue soft eyes bright fairhair. He son Brian, chief M'Swynes, andpeople used sometimes say scornfully poor puny son tocome father, big burly, M'Swyne oughtto be, slim fair, like girl. However, Brian M'Swyne lovedhis fair-haired boy, would given pleasures inthe world pleasure little fellow side andlistening prattling voice. He like mother, said whoremembered blue-eyed stranger Brian M'Swyne brought hometen years wife Doe Castle, Donegal, hadpined years died; perhaps hersake child dear rough old chief. He nevertired little lad beside him, many time wouldcarry cradle arms, pass big fingersthrough boy's golden curls, let little hands play hisbeard. Sitting together firelight winter nights, peat firewas burning floor, wind, sweeping across Lough Eske, wentwailing round castle walls sighing leafless trees, theboy would often get father tell stories country-side.There many strange legends treasured memories oldinhabitants place, wild stories enchantments, fairies orbanshees; little Dermot would never tire listening thesetales. Sometimes, heard half-finished story, hewould go dreaming it, till woven anending, dozen endings, brain. But tales used listen one thatperhaps, other, liked hear--the story theenchanted castle swallowed Lough Belshade. There, beneath thewaters dark lough, looked often, thecastle standing still, gates towers walls perfect, justas stood upon earth, fires still alight hadbeen burning hearths, and--more wonderful all--the peoplewho sunk it, though fixed motionless enchantedsleep, alive too. It wonder wonders; child never tiredof thinking it, dreaming time enchantmentshould broken, person break it; for, strangestof all, story said must sleep M'Swyne comeand wake them. But M'Swyne would it? And done?"Father," little Dermot would say, "tell something theenchanted castle lough." The legend thus: On shores desolate lough oncestood great castle, lived beautiful maiden called Eileen. Herfather chieftain clan, child. Manyyoung lovers sought her, cared none them. At last therecame castle noble-looking knight. He traveled farcountry, said, began soon tell wonderful stories Eileenof beauty richness land his; skies therewere always blue, sun always shone, lords ladies lived,not rough stone-hewn castles like these, palaces brightwith marbles precious stones; lives longdelight, music dancing pleasant things. Eileen listened told tales her, till began longto see country; heart yearned something brighter andbetter sombre life led shores dark lough; andso when, time, knight one day told loved her,she gave promise go home marry him. She contented little promised bethe knight's wife, spent nearly time talking loverand picturing new beautiful things wasgoing see. She happy, whole; though then, totell truth, time went on, began little puzzled andsurprised certain things knight did, certain odd habitsthat had; for, fact, odd habits, indeed, and,charming handsome was, conducted occasionally inreally quite singular way. For instance, curious fact never could bear sightof dog; ever one came near (and good manydogs castle, quite impossible keep comingnear then) would set teeth, rise slowly hisseat, begin make low hissing noise, craning neck forward,and swelling rounding back extraordinary way thefirst time Eileen saw thought going afit, quite alarmed. "Oh, dear, I--I afraid ill!" exclaimed, getting upon herfeet feeling uneasy. "No, no, only--it only--the dog," gasped knight, gripping hisseat hands, needed greatest effort keephimself still. "Hiss--s--s--s! I terrible dislike dogs.It is--it family," said poor young man; could notrecover composure till little animal disturbedhim carried away. Then strange fashion amusing roomwhere slept. It spacious room, hung round arras; andoften, household gone bed, slept nearest tothe knight awakened sleep noise made inrunning down, there; scudding floor,and even--as far could guessed sounds--clambering thewalls, though, instead gracious high-bred younggentleman, veriest tomboy. "I fear, Sir Knight, always rest easily apartment,"Eileen's old father said one morning makingeven disturbance sort usual. "We rough ways herein North, perhaps arrangement sleeping quarters isnot exactly liking?" But knight, began say this, interrupted hastily, anddeclared never slept comfortably room hislife, peacefully, said; seldom conscious even somuch awakening once. Of course, said this, Eileen herfather could open eyes, come conclusion thepoor young knight somnambulist, afflicted habit ofrunning leaping sleep. Again, too, out-of-doors, odd affected hearthe birds sing. Whenever began songs, sorts nervoustwitchings would come him, would lick lips makeconvulsive movements hands; attention would become sodistracted would quite lose thread discourse hewere talking, thread Eileen's, talking him. "Itis I enjoy hearing much," said once; coursewhen said Eileen could believe him; yet could helpwishing would show pleasure way curiousone setting teeth rolling eyes, looking much asif wanted eat birds listen them. Still, spite good many peculiarities, youngknight charming, Eileen fond him. They used tospend happiest days together, wandering wild beautifulcountry, often sitting hours rocky shores dark lough,looking deep still water feet. It wild,romantic, lonely place, shut sunlight great granitecliffs threw dark weird shadows it. "Do know prophecy castle shall stand one dayhere middle lough?" Eileen said, laughing, once. "I don'tknow done, planted somehow themiddle water. That people say. I like tolive then. How gloomy would great shadowsalways us!" girl shivered little, stole hand intoher lover's, began talk far different place whereshe live; beautiful palace, far away sunny countrybeyond sea. She never weary hearing new place andnew life going to, beauty happiness thatwere going hers. So time went on, last day marriage-day came.Eileen showing lover ornaments; greatnumber precious ones, and, please amuse herself, shehad putting on, loading armlets, andbracelets, heavy chains gold, old Irish princessesused wear, till looked gorgeous princess herself. It sunny summer day, sat thinking herself, "My marriedlife begin soon now--the new, beautiful, strange life--and Iwill wear ornaments midst it; everything elseis lovely, think lovely now?" Presently glanced up, little shyness little vanity,just see looking thinking her; liftedup head, instead finding eyes resting her, shefound---- Well, found knight certainly thinking onebit. He sitting staring fixedly one corner apartment, withhis lips working oddest fashion; twitching way that, andparting showing teeth, clawing hands thechair sat. "Dear me!" said Eileen rather sharply pettishly, "what matterwith you?" Eileen spoke pretty crossly; various previousoccasions seen knight conduct sort way, herfeeling less alarm sight simply annoyancethat moment, thinking sotenderly, could giving attention thing. "What isthe matter you?" said; raised chair andturned round head see could perceive anything worthlooking corner knight staring almost ifthe eyes would leap head. "Why, nothing mouse!" said contemptuously, whenshe looked listened moment, heard little faintscratching behind tapestry. "No, no, I believe not; oh, no, nothing mouse," replied knighthurriedly; still take eyes spot, hemoved side side chair, twitched head rightto left, looked altogether hardly knew about. "And I sure mouse harmless thing," said Eileen. "Harmless? Oh! delicious!" replied knight, much unction thatEileen, turn, opened eyes stared. "Delicious! quitedelicious!" murmured knight again. But moment two more, seemed recollecthimself, made great effort, withdrew eyes cornerwhere mouse still making little feeble scratching. "I mean a--a interesting animal," said. "I always felt withregard mice----" But instant mouse poked little head frombeneath tapestry, knight leaped feet wasshot. "Hiss--s--s! skier--r--r! hiss--s--s--s!" cried; and--could Eileenbelieve eyes?--for one instant saw knight flash past her,and nothing living room besides greatblack cat clinging claws half-way arras, littlebrown mouse teeth. Of course thing Eileen could faint, shefainted, six hours came again. In themean time nobody world knew happened; sheopened eyes began cry terrible black cat, theyall thought gone mind. "My dear child, I assure thing house ablack cat," father said uneasily her, trying soothe thebest way could. "Oh, yes, turned black cat," cried Eileen. "Who turned black cat?" asked father. "The knight did," sobbed Eileen. And poor old father went room, thinking hisdaughter going mad. "She quite beside herself; says man, acat," said sorrowfully young knight, met standingoutside daughter's room. "What world could put suchthoughts head? Not thing talk black cats." "Let see her; I bring right mind," said knight. "I doubt much," replied chief; know whatelse do, let go room, knight went softlyand closed door, went couch Eileen lay. Shelay eyes closed, gold chains still upon herneck arms; knight, trod softly, come quite upto side knew there. But moment openedher eyes saw him, gave scream quite made himleap; bolted door every creature castlewould rushed room sound it. Fortunately him,however, bolted door; stout door, madeof strong oak, Eileen might screamed hour anybodycould burst open. As soon, therefore, knight hadrecovered start gave him, quietly took chair satdown side. "Eileen," said, beginning speak once--for probably felt thatthe matter come mention rather painful delicateone, quickly could get say thebetter--"Eileen, unhappily to-day seen under--ahem!--underan unaccustomed shape----" He got far this, Eileen gave another shriek andcovered face hands. "I say," repeated knight, tone annoyance, raisinghis voice, Eileen making noise reallynecessary speak pretty loudly--"I say unfortunately seen meto-day shape prepared for; I come, mylove, assure the--transformation--was purely accidental--amere blunder moment--an occurrence shall never repeated inyour sight. Look again, Eileen, let eve ourmarriage-day----" But knight got say eve marriage-dayEileen never heard, soon reached words gaveanother shriek loud jumped upon seat. "Do think I ever marry black cat?" cried Eileen, fixingher eyes look horror face. "Eileen, take care!" exclaimed knight sternly. "Take care youanger me, worse you." "The worse me! Do think I afraid you?" said Eileen withher eyes flashing, high enough spirit, notgoing allow forced marry black cat, let knightsay would. She rose couch would sprung theground, knight bent forward taken byher hand. "Eileen," said knight, holding fast looking face,"Eileen, wife?" "I would sooner die!" cried Eileen. "Eileen," cried knight passionately, "I love you! Do break yourpromise me. Forget seen. I powerful magician. Iwill make happy. I give want. Be wife." "Never!" cried Eileen. "Then sealed fate!" exclaimed knight fiercely; andsuddenly rose extended arms, said strange words thatEileen understand; appeared somethick white pall spreading her, eyelids began toclose, involuntarily sank back. Once more, dream, heard knight's voice. "If become wife," said, "you shall never wife ofany living man. The black cat hold own. Sleep till anotherlover comes woo you." A mocking laugh rang room--and Eileen heard more. Itseemed life passing away. A strange feeling came toher, sinking air; sound herears rushing water; recollection consciousnessceased. Some travelers passing evening lough gazed spot onwhich castle stood, rubbed eyes wild surprise, forthere castle there, bare tract desolate, wasteground. The prophecy fulfilled; castle lifted upfrom foundation sunk waters lough. This story Dermot used listen sat hisfather's hall winter nights--a wild old story, strange, andsweet too, well strange. For living still, legendalways said--the chief household, beautiful Eileen; deadat all, sleeping enchanted sleep, till one theM'Swynes come kill black cat guarded them, setthem free. Under dark, deep waters, asleep three hundredyears, lay Eileen, massive ornaments neck arms,and red-gold Irish hair. How often boy think her, pictureto motionless face, closed, waiting eyes, yearnto see it. Asleep three hundred years! His heart used burnat imagination. In centuries M'Swyne foundbold enough find black cat kill him? Could hard athing kill black cat? little fellow thought. "I would kill I chance," said one day; andwhen said father laughed. "Ay, lad, might kill chance--but would youget chance?" asked him. "Do think magician would foolenough leave watch lough put way?Kill him? Yes, could us kill could catch him; butthree hundred years passed away nobody ever caught himyet." "Well, I may day, I grown man," Dermot said. So went dreaming old legend, weaving ownbrain ending it. What be, indeed, lot awakeEileen enchanted sleep? He used wander often shoresof dark little lough gaze shadowy waters. Many time,too, would sail across them, leaning boat's side, totry vain catch glimpse buried castle's walls ortowers. Once twice--it might mere fancy--it seemed himas saw dark thing surface, would cry aloud,"The cat! I see black cat!" But laughed hereturned home said this. "It big fish bottom ofthe water, boy," father would reply. When boy talked story often never weary ofasking questions concerning it; presently, grew older, grewmore reserved shy, spoke Eileen color used tocome cheek. "Why, boy, falling love her?" hisfather said one day. "Are unbewitched maidens enough toplease face earth, must take fancy abewitched one lying asleep bottom lough?" laughedaloud him. After day Dermot never spoke Eileen hisfather's hearing. But although ceased speak her, yet themore think dream her; older grew, lessdid seem care unbewitched maidens hisfather talked; maiden thought love andlonging one lay asleep enchanted castle thelough. So years passed on, time Dermot's father died, youngman became chieftain clan. He straight tall, blue,clear eyes, frank, fair face. Some M'Swynes, arough, burly race, looked scornfully said fitterto make love ladies head men battle-field; theywronged said that, braver soldier Dermot hadever led clan. He brave gentle too, courteous,and tender, kind; fit make love toladies--why, making love ladies almost thing neverdid. "Are going bring home wife old house, son?" saidhis foster-mother, old woman lived life."Before I die I would love dandle child upon knee." But Dermot shook head. "My wife, I fear, hard win. Imay wait days." And then, little while,when old woman still went talking him, "How I marry whenmy love asleep three hundred years?" This first time spoken Eileen many day,and old nurse thought, like everybody else, hadforgotten old legend foolish fancies youth. She sitting spinning-wheel, dropped thread andfolded hands sadly knees. "My son, think good dead? Even could winher, would take bewitched maiden wife?" It summer's day, Dermot stood looking far away thesunshine toward where, though could see it, enchanted castlelay. He stood place thousand times, looking towardit, dreaming old tale. For several minutes made answer old woman said;then turned round her. "Nurse," said passionately, "I adored twenty years. Eversince I first stood knees, told her, beenthe one love heart. Unless I marry her, I never marry anywoman world." He came old woman's side, though wasa full-grown man, put arms neck. "Nurse, akeen woman's wit; cannot help it?" said. "I wanderedround lough day night challenged magician come andtry power me, hear me, come.How I reach dark, cruel waters force tocome fight me?" "Foolish lad!" old woman said. She wise old woman, shebelieved much everybody else legend castle inthe lough. "What gain need come fight you?Do think black cat's fool heed ranting andyour challenging?" "But else I do?" The old woman took thread hands again, sat spinning fortwo three minutes without answering word. She sensible oldwoman, seemed sad pity fine young man like herfoster-son waste life pining love maiden whohad lain asleep enchanted three hundred years. Yet nurseloved dearly could bear cross anything, orto refuse anything asked. So sat spinning thinkingfor little while, said: "It mouse made show shape first, andit's mice catching, I guess, bottom thelough. I tell I do. I give half dozen mice abag tomorrow, let loose get water side,and see bring up." Well, Dermot think much plan; still, hadasked old woman help him, felt could avoid takingher advice, next morning nurse gave bag half adozen mice it, carried lough. But, alas! assoon ever opened bag, six mice rushed away likelightning sight moment. "That chance soon ended," Dermot said mournfully himself; hetook back empty bag nurse, told happened. "You goose, let one one?" inquired she."Sure would run opened bag. You made playwith them." "To sure, I should; I never thought that. I betternext time." So next day woman brought bag again, filled time withfat rats, took lough, laid waterside, opened mouth wide enough one rats toput nose; sat watched, watched, letting therats run away one one; though sat watching whole day,not sign ever see black cat. At last camedisconsolately home empty bag shoulder. "Never mind, son, try something else to-morrow," said nursecheerfully. So next morning brought fishing-rod, largepiece toasted cheese. "Take lough bait hook withit," said, "and see black cat come take bite.All cats like cheese." Dermot went immediately lough, baited hook, threw theline water. After minutes heart gave greatjump, felt sudden pull line. He drew softly andcautiously; got water's edge nothing onhis hook large flat fish--and toasted cheese brokenaway gone. "What foolish old woman, give toasted cheese put water!"he said himself; heaved sigh, threw fish bag,and went sadly away. "I dare say villain cat breakfasted nicely toastedcheese without trouble coming it," said bitterly, hegot home. "Never mind; maybe better luck to-morrow," replied nurse."I dreamed dream, dream I thought something else do." So early next morning brought fat black pig. "What world I this?" said Dermot sharply. "Ah, now, easy, dear," said old woman coaxingly. "Just take itdown lough roast there, sure cat smells thefine smell come taste." Now Dermot getting rather tired odd things; andthough readily gone lough mice rats andthe toasted cheese, yet relish notion carryinga live pig across country two three miles. However,he good-natured, so, although think thatany good would come it, little let nursepersuade take pig. The old woman tied string leg,and took lough, soon got collectedsome sticks peat together and, building good big pile, setlight it. Then killed pig hunting-knife hung itup fire roast. Presently savory smell began tofill air. Dermot withdrew little way, sat behind jutting piece rock,and watched, eyes never leaving smooth surface lough; butminute minute passed slightest movement stirred it.From time time made fire afresh, turned pig fromside side. The whole air around grew full smell roastingmeat, savory that, hungry, made Dermot's mouth water;but still--there lay lough, quiet smooth, undisturbed asglass, dark shadows silent rocks lying across it. At last pig cooked ready, Dermot rose drew fromthe fire. "I may well make dinner it," thought sorrowfully tohimself, "for nobody else come share it." So tookhis knife cut juicy slice, sat again, concealinghimself behind rock, bow arrow side, hadjust lifted first morsel lips, when-- Down fell untasted meat upon ground, heart leaped hislips, surely something last stirring waters! The oilysurface broken circles; movement, little splash,a sudden vision something black. A moment two sat breathlesslygazing; then--was asleep, waking, really sawit?--he saw water black cat's head. Black head, black pawsput swim, black back, black tail. Dermot took bow hand, tried fit arrow it; buthis hand shook, moments could draw. Slowly thecreature swam water's edge, and, reaching it, planted feetupon earth, looked warily, green, watchful eye, round;then, shaking itself--and water seemed glide black fur asoff duck's back--it licked lips, and, giving one great sweep intothe air, bounded forward roasted pig smoking theground. For moment Dermot saw it, tail high air andits tongue stretched lick crackling; then, sharp andsure, whiz! went arrow bow; next moment, stretchedflat upon ground, one great dismal howl, lay man-cat, orcat-man, arrow heart. Dermot sprang feet, and, rushing creature's side, caughthim throat; dead already; great, wide-opened,green, fierce eyes seemed shoot almost human look hatredand despair, closed forever. The young chieftain took thebeast, looked it, might flung thelough; turning round, stretched arms passionately. "Eileen! Eileen!" cried aloud; though word broken thespell, once--oh, wonderful sight!--the enchanted castle began torise. Higher rose higher; one little turret first; thenpinnacles tower roof; strong stone walls; until, complete,it stood upon surface lough like strange floating ship. Andthen slowly gently drifted shore and, rising thewater's edge, glided little air, sank last upon theearth, fixing firmly stood old, asif foundations never stirred whole thosethree hundred years. With heart beating fast, Dermot stood gazing could nevercease gaze. It lovely summer day, landscape roundhim bathed sunlight. The radiance shone gray castlewalls made leaf every tree golden glory. It shone onbright flowers blooming castle garden; shone human figuresthat began live move. Breathless motionless, Dermot watchedthem. He close them, near enough see theirstrange quaint dresses, passing fro, like figures hadstarted painted picture by-gone age. The place grew fullof them. They poured castle gates; gathered intogroups; spread abroad; streamed castleright left. Did know asleep? Apparently not,for man went natural occupation, butpaused minute take breath. A hum voices filled air;Dermot heard strange accents, almost like unknown tongue,mingled sound laughter. Three hundred years passed away,and yet seem know it; busily went theirsports labors--as calmly unconsciously never beeninterrupted hour. And, midst all, Eileen? The young chieftain stoodlooking strange scene him, heart beating high andfast. He killed cat, broken enchantment, hadawakened castle sleep, come next? Did theprophecy, said M'Swyne this, say also that, fordoing it, given reward? Nay, said nothing more. The rest blank. But there,then, reward him? Dermot stood suddenly erect crusheddown certain faintness rising heart. Theprophecy, indeed, said nothing, would carve rest hisdestiny himself. And carved out. He went straight unknown people tothe castle garden found--was sought? He found ladygathering flowers--a lady rich dress, golden armlets,bracelets, head-ornaments--such discovered tombs.But dead; alive young. For turned round,and, life's patient waiting, Dermot saw Eileen's face. And then--what more? Well, need I tell rest? What ending could thestory one? Of course made love him, married,and lived, died. That whole. They probably happy--I donot know. You may see little lough still wild country ofDonegal, deep dark waters hid enchanted castle beneaththem many years. As castle itself--that, I think, hascrumbled away; whole story story legend--one thepretty, foolish legends old times.
