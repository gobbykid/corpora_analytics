 LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY I Cedric knew nothing whatever it. It never even mentioned him. He knew papa Englishman, mamma told so; papa died little boy could remember much him, except big, blue eyes long mustache, splendid thing carried around room shoulder. Since papa's death, Cedric found best talk mamma him. When father ill, Cedric sent away, returned, everything over; mother, ill, too, beginning sit chair window. She pale thin, dimples gone pretty face, eyes looked large mournful, dressed black. “Dearest,” said Cedric (his papa called always, little boy learned say it),--“dearest, papa better?” He felt arms tremble, turned curly head looked face. There something made feel going cry. “Dearest,” said, “is well?” Then suddenly loving little heart told would better put arms around neck kiss again, keep soft cheek close hers; so, laid face shoulder cried bitterly, holding could never let go again. “Yes, well,” sobbed; “he quite, quite well, we--we one left other. No one all.” Then, little was, understood big, handsome young papa would come back more; dead, heard people being, although could comprehend exactly strange thing brought sadness about. It mamma always cried spoke papa secretly made mind better speak often her, found out, too, better let sit still look fire window without moving talking. He mamma knew people, lived might thought lonely lives, although Cedric know lonely grew older heard visitors. Then told mamma orphan, quite alone world papa married her. She pretty, living companion rich old lady kind her, one day Captain Cedric Errol, calling house, saw run stairs tears eyelashes; looked sweet innocent sorrowful Captain could forget her. And many strange things happened, knew well loved dearly, married, although marriage brought ill-will several persons. The one angry all, however, Captain's father, lived England, rich important old nobleman, bad temper violent dislike America Americans. He two sons older Captain Cedric; law elder sons inherit family title estates, rich splendid; eldest son died, next one would heir; so, though member great family, little chance Captain Cedric would rich himself. But happened Nature given youngest son gifts bestowed upon elder brothers. He beautiful face fine, strong, graceful figure; bright smile sweet, gay voice; brave generous, kindest heart world, seemed power make every one love him. And elder brothers; neither handsome, kind, clever. When boys Eton, popular; college, cared nothing study, wasted time money, made real friends. The old Earl, father, constantly disappointed humiliated them; heir honor noble name, promise end anything selfish, wasteful, insignificant man, manly noble qualities. It bitter, old Earl thought, son third, would small fortune, one gifts, charms, strength beauty. Sometimes almost hated handsome young man seemed good things gone stately title magnificent estates; yet, depths proud, stubborn old heart, could help caring much youngest son. It one fits petulance sent travel America; thought would send away while, made angry constantly contrasting brothers, time giving great deal trouble wild ways. But, six months, began feel lonely, longed secret see son again, wrote Captain Cedric ordered home. The letter wrote crossed way letter Captain written father, telling love pretty American girl, intended marriage; Earl received letter furiously angry. Bad temper was, never given way life gave way read Captain's letter. His valet, room came, thought lordship would fit apoplexy, wild anger. For hour raged like tiger, sat wrote son, ordered never come near old home, write father brothers again. He told might live pleased, die pleased, cut family forever, need never expect help father long lived. The Captain sad read letter; fond England, dearly loved beautiful home born; even loved ill-tempered old father, sympathized disappointments; knew need expect kindness future. At first scarcely knew do; brought work, business experience, courage plenty determination. So sold commission English army, trouble found situation New York, married. The change old life England great, young happy, hoped hard work would great things future. He small house quiet street, little boy born there, everything gay cheerful, simple way, never sorry moment married rich old lady's pretty companion sweet loved loved him. She sweet, indeed, little boy like father. Though born quiet cheap little home, seemed never fortunate baby. In first place, always well, never gave one trouble; second place, sweet temper ways charming pleasure every one; third place, beautiful look quite picture. Instead bald-headed baby, started life quantity soft, fine, gold-colored hair, curled ends, went loose rings time six months old; big brown eyes long eyelashes darling little face; strong back splendid sturdy legs, nine months learned suddenly walk; manners good, baby, delightful make acquaintance. He seemed feel every one friend, one spoke him, carriage street, would give stranger one sweet, serious look brown eyes, follow lovely, friendly smile; consequence was, person neighborhood quiet street lived--even groceryman corner, considered crossest creature alive--who pleased see speak him. And every month life grew handsomer interesting. When old enough walk nurse, dragging small wagon wearing short white kilt skirt, big white hat set back curly yellow hair, handsome strong rosy attracted every one's attention, nurse would come home tell mamma stories ladies stopped carriages look speak him, pleased talked cheerful little way, known always. His greatest charm cheerful, fearless, quaint little way making friends people. I think arose confiding nature, kind little heart sympathized every one, wished make every one comfortable liked himself. It made quick understand feelings him. Perhaps grown him, too, lived much father mother, always loving considerate tender well-bred. He never heard unkind uncourteous word spoken home; always loved caressed treated tenderly, childish soul full kindness innocent warm feeling. He always heard mamma called pretty, loving names, used spoke her; always seen papa watched took great care her, learned, too, careful her. So knew papa would come back more, saw sad mamma was, gradually came kind little heart thought must could make happy. He much baby, thought mind whenever climbed upon knee kissed put curly head neck, brought toys picture-books show her, curled quietly side used lie sofa. He old enough know anything else do, could, comfort could understood. “Oh, Mary!” heard say old servant; “I sure trying help innocent way--I know is. He looks sometimes loving, wondering little look, sorry me, come pet show something. He little man, I really think knows.” As grew older, great many quaint little ways amused interested people greatly. He much companion mother scarcely cared other. They used walk together talk together play together. When quite little fellow, learned read; used lie hearth-rug, evening, read aloud--sometimes stories, sometimes big books older people read, sometimes even newspaper; often times Mary, kitchen, would hear Mrs. Errol laughing delight quaint things said. “And, indade,” said Mary groceryman, “nobody cud help laughin' quare little ways him--and ould-fashioned sayin's! Did come kitchen noight new Prisident nominated shtand afore fire, lookin' loike pictur', wid hands shmall pockets, an' innocent bit face sayrious jedge? An' sez me: 'Mary,' sez he, 'I much int'rusted 'lection,' sez he. 'I 'publican, an' Dearest. Are 'publican, Mary?' 'Sorra bit,' sez I; 'I bist dimmycrats!' An' looks wid look ud go yer heart, an' sez he: 'Mary,' sez he, 'the country go ruin.' An' nivver day since thin let go widout argyin' wid change polytics.” Mary fond him, proud him, too. She mother ever since born; and, father's death, cook housemaid nurse everything else. She proud graceful, strong little body pretty manners, especially proud bright curly hair waved forehead fell charming love-locks shoulders. She willing work early late help mamma make small suits keep order. “'Ristycratic, it?” would say. “Faith, an' I would loike see choild Fifth Avey-NOO looks loike an' shteps handsome himself. An' ivvery man, woman, choild lookin' afther bit black velvet skirt made misthress's ould gownd; an' little head up, an' curly hair flyin' an' shinin'. It loike young lord looks.” Cedric know looked like young lord; know lord was. His greatest friend groceryman corner--the cross groceryman, never cross him. His name Mr. Hobbs, Cedric admired respected much. He thought rich powerful person, many things store,--prunes figs oranges biscuits,--and horse wagon. Cedric fond milkman baker apple-woman, liked Mr. Hobbs best all, terms intimacy went see every day, often sat quite long time, discussing topics hour. It quite surprising many things found talk about--the Fourth July, instance. When began talk Fourth July really seemed end it. Mr. Hobbs bad opinion “the British,” told whole story Revolution, relating wonderful patriotic stories villainy enemy bravery Revolutionary heroes, even generously repeated part Declaration Independence. Cedric excited eyes shone cheeks red curls rubbed tumbled yellow mop. He could hardly wait eat dinner went home, anxious tell mamma. It was, perhaps, Mr. Hobbs gave first interest politics. Mr. Hobbs fond reading newspapers, Cedric heard great deal going Washington; Mr. Hobbs would tell whether President duty not. And once, election, found quite grand, probably Mr. Hobbs Cedric country might wrecked. Mr. Hobbs took see great torchlight procession, many men carried torches remembered afterward stout man stood near lamp-post held shoulder handsome little shouting boy, waved cap air. It long election, Cedric seven eight years old, strange thing happened made wonderful change life. It quite curious, too, day happened talking Mr. Hobbs England Queen, Mr. Hobbs said severe things aristocracy, specially indignant earls marquises. It hot morning; playing soldiers friends his, Cedric gone store rest, found Mr. Hobbs looking fierce piece Illustrated London News, contained picture court ceremony. “Ah,” said, “that way go now; get enough day, trod rise blow sky-high,--earls marquises all! It coming, may look it!” Cedric perched usual high stool pushed hat back, put hands pockets delicate compliment Mr. Hobbs. “Did ever know many marquises, Mr. Hobbs?” Cedric inquired,--“or earls?” “No,” answered Mr. Hobbs, indignation; “I guess not. I would like catch one inside here; all! I grasping tyrants sittin' 'round cracker-barrels!” And proud sentiment looked around proudly mopped forehead. “Perhaps would earls knew better,” said Cedric, feeling vague sympathy unhappy condition. “Would they!” said Mr. Hobbs. “They glory it! It them. They bad lot.” They midst conversation, Mary appeared. Cedric thought come buy sugar, perhaps, not. She looked almost pale excited something. “Come home, darlint,” said; “the misthress wantin' yez.” Cedric slipped stool. “Does want go her, Mary?” asked. “Good-morning, Mr. Hobbs. I see again.” He surprised see Mary staring dumfounded fashion, wondered kept shaking head. “What matter, Mary?” said. “Is hot weather?” “No,” said Mary; “but strange things happenin' us.” “Has sun given Dearest headache?” inquired anxiously. But that. When reached house coupe standing door one little parlor talking mamma. Mary hurried upstairs put best summer suit cream-colored flannel, red scarf around waist, combed curly locks. “Lords, it?” heard say. “An' nobility an' gintry. Och! bad cess them! Lords, indade--worse luck.” It really puzzling, felt sure mamma would tell excitement meant, allowed Mary bemoan without asking many questions. When dressed, ran downstairs went parlor. A tall, thin old gentleman sharp face sitting arm-chair. His mother standing near pale face, saw tears eyes. “Oh! Ceddie!” cried out, ran little boy caught arms kissed frightened, troubled way. “Oh! Ceddie, darling!” The tall old gentleman rose chair looked Cedric sharp eyes. He rubbed thin chin bony hand looked. He seemed displeased. “And so,” said last, slowly,--“and little Lord Fauntleroy.” II There never amazed little boy Cedric week followed; never strange unreal week. In first place, story mamma told curious one. He obliged hear two three times could understand it. He could imagine Mr. Hobbs would think it. It began earls: grandpapa, never seen, earl; eldest uncle, killed fall horse, would earl, too, time; death, uncle would earl, died suddenly, Rome, fever. After that, papa, lived, would earl, but, since died Cedric left, appeared HE earl grandpapa's death--and present Lord Fauntleroy. He turned quite pale first told it. “Oh! Dearest!” said, “I rather earl. None boys earls. Cannot I NOT one?” But seemed unavoidable. And when, evening, sat together open window looking shabby street, mother long talk it. Cedric sat footstool, clasping one knee favorite attitude wearing bewildered little face rather red exertion thinking. His grandfather sent come England, mamma thought must go. “Because,” said, looking window sorrowful eyes, “I know papa would wish so, Ceddie. He loved home much; many things thought little boy cannot quite understand. I selfish little mother I send you. When man, see why.” Ceddie shook head mournfully. “I shall sorry leave Mr. Hobbs,” said. “I afraid miss me, I shall miss him. And I shall miss all.” When Mr. Havisham--who family lawyer Earl Dorincourt, sent bring Lord Fauntleroy England--came next day, Cedric heard many things. But, somehow, console hear rich man grew up, would castles castles there, great parks deep mines grand estates tenantry. He troubled friend, Mr. Hobbs, went see store soon breakfast, great anxiety mind. He found reading morning paper, approached grave demeanor. He really felt would great shock Mr. Hobbs hear befallen him, way store thinking would best break news. “Hello!” said Mr. Hobbs. “Mornin'!” “Good-morning,” said Cedric. He climb high stool usual, sat cracker-box clasped knee, silent moments Mr. Hobbs finally looked inquiringly top newspaper. “Hello!” said again. Cedric gathered strength mind together. “Mr. Hobbs,” said, “do remember talking yesterday morning?” “Well,” replied Mr. Hobbs,--“seems England.” “Yes,” said Cedric; “but Mary came me, know?” Mr. Hobbs rubbed back head. “We WAS mentioning Queen Victoria aristocracy.” “Yes,” said Cedric, rather hesitatingly, “and--and earls; know?” “Why, yes,” returned Mr. Hobbs; “we DID touch little; so!” Cedric flushed curly bang forehead. Nothing embarrassing ever happened life. He little afraid might trifle embarrassing Mr. Hobbs, too. “You said,” proceeded, “that would sitting 'round cracker-barrels.” “So I did!” returned Mr. Hobbs, stoutly. “And I meant it. Let try it--that all!” “Mr. Hobbs,” said Cedric, “one sitting box now!” Mr. Hobbs almost jumped chair. “What!” exclaimed. “Yes,” Cedric announced, due modesty; “_I_ one--or I going be. I deceive you.” Mr. Hobbs looked agitated. He rose suddenly went look thermometer. “The mercury's got head!” exclaimed, turning back examine young friend's countenance. “It IS hot day! How feel? Got pain? When begin feel way?” He put big hand little boy's hair. This embarrassing ever. “Thank you,” said Ceddie; “I right. There nothing matter head. I sorry say true, Mr. Hobbs. That Mary came take home for. Mr. Havisham telling mamma, lawyer.” Mr. Hobbs sank chair mopped forehead handkerchief. “ONE us got sunstroke!” exclaimed. “No,” returned Cedric, “we not. We shall make best it, Mr. Hobbs. Mr. Havisham came way England tell us it. My grandpapa sent him.” Mr. Hobbs stared wildly innocent, serious little face him. “Who grandfather?” asked. Cedric put hand pocket carefully drew piece paper, something written round, irregular hand. “I could easily remember it, I wrote this,” said. And read aloud slowly: “'John Arthur Molyneux Errol, Earl Dorincourt.' That name, lives castle--in two three castles, I think. And papa, died, youngest son; I lord earl papa died; papa would earl two brothers died. But died, one me,--no boy,--and I one; grandpapa sent come England.” Mr. Hobbs seemed grow hotter hotter. He mopped forehead bald spot breathed hard. He began see something remarkable happened; looked little boy sitting cracker-box, innocent, anxious expression childish eyes, saw changed all, simply day before, handsome, cheerful, brave little fellow blue suit red neck-ribbon, information nobility bewildered him. He bewildered Cedric gave ingenuous simplicity, plainly without realizing stupendous was. “Wha--what say name was?” Mr. Hobbs inquired. “It Cedric Errol, Lord Fauntleroy,” answered Cedric. “That Mr. Havisham called me. He said I went room: 'And little Lord Fauntleroy!'” “Well,” said Mr. Hobbs, “I be--jiggered!” This exclamation always used much astonished excited. He could think nothing else say puzzling moment. Cedric felt quite proper suitable ejaculation. His respect affection Mr. Hobbs great admired approved remarks. He seen enough society yet make realize sometimes Mr. Hobbs quite conventional. He knew, course, different mamma, but, then, mamma lady, idea ladies always different gentlemen. He looked Mr. Hobbs wistfully. “England long way off, it?” asked. “It across Atlantic Ocean,” Mr. Hobbs answered. “That worst it,” said Cedric. “Perhaps I shall see long time. I like think that, Mr. Hobbs.” “The best friends must part,” said Mr. Hobbs. “Well,” said Cedric, “we friends great many years, we?” “Ever since born,” Mr. Hobbs answered. “You six weeks old first walked street.” “Ah,” remarked Cedric, sigh, “I never thought I earl then!” “You think,” said Mr. Hobbs, “there getting it?” “I afraid not,” answered Cedric. “My mamma says papa would wish it. But I earl, one thing I do: I try good one. I going tyrant. And ever another war America, I shall try stop it.” His conversation Mr. Hobbs long serious one. Once got first shock, Mr. Hobbs rancorous might expected; endeavored resign situation, interview end asked great many questions. As Cedric could answer them, endeavored answer himself, and, fairly launched subject earls marquises lordly estates, explained many things way would probably astonished Mr. Havisham, could gentleman heard it. But many things astonished Mr. Havisham. He spent life England, accustomed American people American habits. He connected professionally family Earl Dorincourt nearly forty years, knew grand estates great wealth importance; and, cold, business-like way, felt interest little boy, who, future, master owner all,--the future Earl Dorincourt. He known old Earl's disappointment elder sons fierce rage Captain Cedric's American marriage, knew still hated gentle little widow would speak except bitter cruel words. He insisted common American girl, entrapped son marrying knew earl's son. The old lawyer half believed true. He seen great many selfish, mercenary people life, good opinion Americans. When driven cheap street, coupe stopped cheap, small house, felt actually shocked. It seemed really quite dreadful think future owner Dorincourt Castle Wyndham Towers Chorlworth, stately splendors, born brought insignificant house street sort green-grocery corner. He wondered kind child would be, kind mother had. He rather shrank seeing both. He sort pride noble family whose legal affairs conducted long, would annoyed much found obliged manage woman would seem vulgar, money-loving person, respect dead husband's country dignity name. It old name splendid one, Mr. Havisham great respect himself, though cold, keen, business-like old lawyer. When Mary handed small parlor, looked around critically. It plainly furnished, home-like look; cheap, common ornaments, cheap, gaudy pictures; adornments walls good taste room many pretty things woman's hand might made. “Not bad far,” said himself; “but perhaps Captain's taste predominated.” But Mrs. Errol came room, began think might something it. If quite self-contained stiff old gentleman, would probably started saw her. She looked, simple black dress, fitting closely slender figure, like young girl mother boy seven. She pretty, sorrowful, young face, tender, innocent look large brown eyes,--the sorrowful look never quite left face since husband died. Cedric used seeing there; times ever seen fade playing talking her, said old-fashioned thing, used long word picked newspapers conversations Mr. Hobbs. He fond using long words, always pleased made laugh, though could understand laughable; quite serious matters him. The lawyer's experience taught read people's characters shrewdly, soon saw Cedric's mother knew old Earl made great mistake thinking vulgar, mercenary woman. Mr. Havisham never married, never even love, divined pretty young creature sweet voice sad eyes married Captain Errol loved affectionate heart, never thought advantage earl's son. And saw trouble her, began feel perhaps little Lord Fauntleroy might trial noble family, all. The Captain handsome fellow, young mother pretty, perhaps boy might well enough look at. When first told Mrs. Errol come for, turned pale. “Oh!” said; “will taken away me? We love much! He happiness me! He I have. I tried good mother him.” And sweet young voice trembled, tears rushed eyes. “You know me!” said. The lawyer cleared throat. “I obliged tell you,” said, “that Earl Dorincourt not--is friendly toward you. He old man, prejudices strong. He always especially disliked America Americans, much enraged son's marriage. I sorry bearer unpleasant communication, fixed determination see you. His plan Lord Fauntleroy shall educated supervision; shall live him. The Earl attached Dorincourt Castle, spends great deal time there. He victim inflammatory gout, fond London. Lord Fauntleroy will, therefore, likely live chiefly Dorincourt. The Earl offers home Court Lodge, situated pleasantly, far castle. He also offers suitable income. Lord Fauntleroy permitted visit you; stipulation is, shall visit enter park gates. You see really separated son, I assure you, madam, terms harsh as--as might been. The advantage surroundings education Lord Fauntleroy have, I sure must see, great.” He felt little uneasy lest begin cry make scene, knew women would done. It embarrassed annoyed see women cry. But not. She went window stood face turned away moments, saw trying steady herself. “Captain Errol fond Dorincourt,” said last. “He loved England, everything English. It always grief parted home. He proud home, name. He would wish--I know would wish son know beautiful old places, brought way would suitable future position.” Then came back table stood looking Mr. Havisham gently. “My husband would wish it,” said. “It best little boy. I know--I sure Earl would unkind try teach love me; I know--even tried--that little boy much like father harmed. He warm, faithful nature, true heart. He would love even see me; long may see other, I ought suffer much.” “She thinks little herself,” lawyer thought. “She make terms herself.” “Madam,” said aloud, “I respect consideration son. He thank man. I assure Lord Fauntleroy carefully guarded, every effort used insure happiness. The Earl Dorincourt anxious comfort well-being could be.” “I hope,” said tender little mother, rather broken voice, “that grandfather love Ceddie. The little boy affectionate nature; always loved.” Mr. Havisham cleared throat again. He could quite imagine gouty, fiery-tempered old Earl loving one much; knew would interest kind, irritable way, child heir. He knew, too, Ceddie credit name, grandfather would proud him. “Lord Fauntleroy comfortable, I sure,” replied. “It view happiness Earl desired near enough see frequently.” He think would discreet repeat exact words Earl used, fact neither polite amiable. Mr. Havisham preferred express noble patron's offer smoother courteous language. He another slight shock Mrs. Errol asked Mary find little boy bring her, Mary told was. “Sure I foind aisy enough, madam,” said; “for wid Mr. Hobbs minnit, settin' high shtool counther an' talkin' pollytics, loikely, enj'yin' hisself among soap an' candles an' pertaties, sinsible an' shwate ye plase.” “Mr. Hobbs known life,” Mrs. Errol said lawyer. “He kind Ceddie, great friendship them.” Remembering glimpse caught store passed it, recollection barrels potatoes apples various odds ends, Mr. Havisham felt doubts arise again. In England, gentlemen's sons make friends grocerymen, seemed rather singular proceeding. It would awkward child bad manners disposition like low company. One bitterest humiliations old Earl's life two elder sons fond low company. Could be, thought, boy shared bad qualities instead father's good qualities? He thinking uneasily talked Mrs. Errol child came room. When door opened, actually hesitated moment looking Cedric. It would, perhaps, seemed queer great many people knew him, could known curious sensations passed Mr. Havisham looked boy, ran mother's arms. He experienced revulsion feeling quite exciting. He recognized instant one finest handsomest little fellows ever seen. His beauty something unusual. He strong, lithe, graceful little body manly little face; held childish head up, carried brave air; like father really startling; father's golden hair mother's brown eyes, nothing sorrowful timid them. They innocently fearless eyes; looked never feared doubted anything life. “He best-bred-looking handsomest little fellow I ever saw,” Mr. Havisham thought. What said aloud simply, “And little Lord Fauntleroy.” And, this, saw little Lord Fauntleroy, surprise found him. He knew little children, though seen plenty England--fine, handsome, rosy girls boys, strictly taken care tutors governesses, sometimes shy, sometimes trifle boisterous, never interesting ceremonious, rigid old lawyer. Perhaps personal interest little Lord Fauntleroy's fortunes made notice Ceddie noticed children; but, however was, certainly found noticing great deal. Cedric know observed, behaved ordinary manner. He shook hands Mr. Havisham friendly way introduced other, answered questions unhesitating readiness answered Mr. Hobbs. He neither shy bold, Mr. Havisham talking mother, lawyer noticed listened conversation much interest quite grown up. “He seems mature little fellow,” Mr. Havisham said mother. “I think is, things,” answered. “He always quick learn, lived great deal grownup people. He funny little habit using long words expressions read books, heard others use, fond childish play. I think rather clever, boyish little boy, sometimes.” The next time Mr. Havisham met him, saw last quite true. As coupe turned corner, caught sight group small boys, evidently much excited. Two run race, one young lordship, shouting making much noise noisiest companions. He stood side side another boy, one little red leg advanced step. “One, make ready!” yelled starter. “Two, steady. Three--and away!” Mr. Havisham found leaning window coupe curious feeling interest. He really never remembered seen anything quite like way lordship's lordly little red legs flew behind knickerbockers tore ground shot race signal word. He shut small hands set face wind; bright hair streamed behind. “Hooray, Ced Errol!” boys shouted, dancing shrieking excitement. “Hooray, Billy Williams! Hooray, Ceddie! Hooray, Billy! Hooray! 'Ray! 'Ray!” “I really believe going win,” said Mr. Havisham. The way red legs flew flashed down, shrieks boys, wild efforts Billy Williams, whose brown legs despised, followed closely rear red legs, made feel excitement. “I really--I really cannot help hoping win!” said, apologetic sort cough. At moment, wildest yell went dancing, hopping boys. With one last frantic leap future Earl Dorincourt reached lamp-post end block touched it, two seconds Billy Williams flung it, panting. “Three cheers Ceddie Errol!” yelled little boys. “Hooray Ceddie Errol!” Mr. Havisham drew head window coupe leaned back dry smile. “Bravo, Lord Fauntleroy!” said. As carriage stopped door Mrs. Errol's house, victor vanquished coming toward it, attended clamoring crew. Cedric walked Billy Williams speaking him. His elated little face red, curls clung hot, moist forehead, hands pockets. “You see,” saying, evidently intention making defeat easy unsuccessful rival, “I guess I legs little longer yours. I guess it. You see, I three days older you, gives 'vantage. I three days older.” And view case seemed cheer Billy Williams much began smile world again, felt able swagger little, almost race instead losing it. Somehow, Ceddie Errol way making people feel comfortable. Even first flush triumphs, remembered person beaten might feel gay did, might like think MIGHT winner different circumstances. That morning Mr. Havisham quite long conversation winner race--a conversation made smile dry smile, rub chin bony hand several times. Mrs. Errol called parlor, lawyer Cedric left together. At first Mr. Havisham wondered say small companion. He idea perhaps would best say several things might prepare Cedric meeting grandfather, and, perhaps, great change come him. He could see Cedric least idea sort thing see reached England, sort home waited there. He even know yet mother live house him. They thought best let get first shock telling him. Mr. Havisham sat arm-chair one side open window; side another still larger chair, Cedric sat looked Mr. Havisham. He sat well back depths big seat, curly head cushioned back, legs crossed, hands thrust deep pockets, quite Mr. Hobbs-like way. He watching Mr. Havisham steadily mamma room, gone still looked respectful thoughtfulness. There short silence Mrs. Errol went out, Cedric seemed studying Mr. Havisham, Mr. Havisham certainly studying Cedric. He could make mind elderly gentleman say little boy races, wore short knickerbockers red stockings legs long enough hang big chair sat well back it. But Cedric relieved suddenly beginning conversation himself. “Do know,” said, “I know earl is?” “Do you?” said Mr. Havisham. “No,” replied Ceddie. “And I think boy going one, ought know. Do you?” “Well--yes,” answered Mr. Havisham. “Would mind,” said Ceddie respectfully--“would mind 'splaining me?” (Sometimes used long words pronounce quite correctly.) “What made earl?” “A king queen, first place,” said Mr. Havisham. “Generally, made earl done service sovereign, great deed.” “Oh!” said Cedric; “that like President.” “Is it?” said Mr. Havisham. “Is presidents elected?” “Yes,” answered Ceddie cheerfully. “When man good knows great deal, elected president. They torch-light processions bands, everybody makes speeches. I used think I might perhaps president, I never thought earl. I know earls,” said, rather hastily, lest Mr. Havisham might feel impolite wished one,--“if I would known them, I dare say I thought I like one.” “It rather different president,” said Mr. Havisham. “Is it?” asked Cedric. “How? Are torch-light processions?” Mr. Havisham crossed legs put tips fingers carefully together. He thought perhaps time come explain matters rather clearly. “An earl is--is important person,” began. “So president!” put Ceddie. “The torch-light processions five miles long, shoot rockets, band plays! Mr. Hobbs took see them.” “An earl,” Mr. Havisham went on, feeling rather uncertain ground, “is frequently ancient lineage----” “What that?” asked Ceddie. “Of old family--extremely old.” “Ah!” said Cedric, thrusting hands deeper pockets. “I suppose way apple-woman near park. I dare say ancient lin-lenage. She old would surprise stand up. She hundred, I think, yet rains, even. I sorry her, boys. Billy Williams nearly dollar, I asked buy five cents' worth apples every day spent all. That made twenty days, grew tired apples week; then--it quite fortunate--a gentleman gave fifty cents I bought apples instead. You feel sorry one poor ancient lin-lenage. She says gone bones rain makes worse.” Mr. Havisham felt rather loss looked companion's innocent, serious little face. “I afraid quite understand me,” explained. “When I said 'ancient lineage' I mean old age; I meant name family known world long time; perhaps hundreds years persons bearing name known spoken history country.” “Like George Washington,” said Ceddie. “I heard ever since I born, known about, long that. Mr. Hobbs says never forgotten. That Declaration Independence, know, Fourth July. You see, brave man.” “The first Earl Dorincourt,” said Mr. Havisham solemnly, “was created earl four hundred years ago.” “Well, well!” said Ceddie. “That long time ago! Did tell Dearest that? It would int'rust much. We tell comes in. She always likes hear cur'us things. What else earl besides created?” “A great many helped govern England. Some brave men fought great battles old days.” “I like myself,” said Cedric. “My papa soldier, brave man--as brave George Washington. Perhaps would earl died. I glad earls brave. That great 'vantage--to brave man. Once I used rather afraid things--in dark, know; I thought soldiers Revolution George Washington--it cured me.” “There another advantage earl, sometimes,” said Mr. Havisham slowly, fixed shrewd eyes little boy rather curious expression. “Some earls great deal money.” He curious wondered young friend knew power money was. “That good thing have,” said Ceddie innocently. “I wish I great deal money.” “Do you?” said Mr. Havisham. “And why?” “Well,” explained Cedric, “there many things person money. You see, apple-woman. If I rich I buy little tent put stall in, little stove, I give dollar every morning rained, could afford stay home. And then--oh! I would give shawl. And, see, bones would feel badly. Her bones like bones; hurt moves. It painful bones hurt you. If I rich enough things her, I guess bones would right.” “Ahem!” said Mr. Havisham. “And else would rich?” “Oh! I would great many things. Of course I buy Dearest sorts beautiful things, needle-books fans gold thimbles rings, encyclopedia, carriage, need wait street-cars. If liked pink silk dresses, I buy some, likes black best. But I would, take big stores, tell look 'round choose herself. And Dick----” “Who Dick?” asked Mr. Havisham. “Dick boot-black,” said young lordship, quite warming interest plans exciting. “He one nicest boot-blacks ever knew. He stands corner street down-town. I known years. Once I little, I walking Dearest, bought beautiful ball bounced, I carrying bounced middle street carriages horses were, I disappointed, I began cry--I little. I kilts on. And Dick blacking man's shoes, said 'Hello!' ran horses caught ball wiped coat gave said, 'It right, young un.' So Dearest admired much, I, ever since then, go down-town, talk him. He says 'Hello!' I say 'Hello!' talk little, tells trade is. It bad lately.” “And would like him?” inquired lawyer, rubbing chin smiling queer smile. “Well,” said Lord Fauntleroy, settling chair business air, “I would buy Jake out.” “And Jake?” Mr. Havisham asked. “He Dick's partner, worst partner fellow could have! Dick says so. He credit business, square. He cheats, makes Dick mad. It would make mad, know, blacking boots hard could, square time, partner square all. People like Dick, like Jake, sometimes come twice. So I rich, I would buy Jake get Dick 'boss' sign--he says 'boss' sign goes long way; I would get new clothes new brushes, start fair. He says wants start fair.” There could nothing confiding innocent way small lordship told little story, quoting friend Dick's bits slang candid good faith. He seemed feel shade doubt elderly companion would interested himself. And truth Mr. Havisham beginning greatly interested; perhaps quite much Dick apple-woman kind little lordling, whose curly head busy, yellow thatch, good-natured plans friends, seemed somehow forgotten altogether. “Is anything----” began. “What would get yourself, rich?” “Lots things!” answered Lord Fauntleroy briskly; “but first I would give Mary money Bridget--that sister, twelve children, husband work. She comes cries, Dearest gives things basket, cries again, says: 'Blessin's yez, beautiful lady.' And I think Mr. Hobbs would like gold watch chain remember by, meerschaum pipe. And I would like get company.” “A company!” exclaimed Mr. Havisham. “Like Republican rally,” explained Cedric, becoming quite excited. “I would torches uniforms things boys myself, too. And would march, know, drill. That I like myself, I rich.” The door opened Mrs. Errol came in. “I sorry obliged leave long,” said Mr. Havisham; “but poor woman, great trouble, came see me.” “This young gentleman,” said Mr. Havisham, “has telling friends, would rich.” “Bridget one friends,” said Mrs. Errol; “and Bridget I talking kitchen. She great trouble husband rheumatic fever.” Cedric slipped big chair. “I think I go see her,” said, “and ask is. He nice man well. I obliged made sword wood. He talented man.” He ran room, Mr. Havisham rose chair. He seemed something mind wished speak of. He hesitated moment, said, looking Mrs. Errol: “Before I left Dorincourt Castle, I interview Earl, gave instructions. He desirous grandson look forward pleasure future life England, also acquaintance himself. He said I must let lordship know change life would bring money pleasures children enjoy; expressed wishes, I gratify them, tell grand-father given wished. I aware Earl expect anything quite like this; would give Lord Fauntleroy pleasure assist poor woman, I feel Earl would displeased gratified.” For second time, repeat Earl's exact words. His lordship had, indeed, said: “Make lad understand I give anything wants. Let know grandson Earl Dorincourt. Buy everything takes fancy to; let money pockets, tell grandfather put there.” His motives far good, dealing nature less affectionate warm-hearted little Lord Fauntleroy's, great harm might done. And Cedric's mother gentle suspect harm. She thought perhaps meant lonely, unhappy old man, whose children dead, wished kind little boy, win love confidence. And pleased much think Ceddie would able help Bridget. It made happier know first result strange fortune befallen little boy could kind things needed kindness. Quite warm color bloomed pretty young face. “Oh!” said, “that kind Earl; Cedric glad! He always fond Bridget Michael. They quite deserving. I often wished I able help more. Michael hard-working man well, ill long time needs expensive medicines warm clothing nourishing food. He Bridget wasteful given them.” Mr. Havisham put thin hand breast pocket drew forth large pocket-book. There queer look keen face. The truth was, wondering Earl Dorincourt would say told first wish grandson granted. He wondered cross, worldly, selfish old nobleman would think it. “I know realized,” said, “that Earl Dorincourt exceedingly rich man. He afford gratify caprice. I think would please know Lord Fauntleroy indulged fancy. If call back allow me, I shall give five pounds people.” “That would twenty-five dollars!” exclaimed Mrs. Errol. “It seem like wealth them. I scarcely believe true.” “It quite true,” said Mr. Havisham, dry smile. “A great change taken place son's life, great deal power lie hands.” “Oh!” cried mother. “And little boy--a little boy. How I teach use well? It makes half afraid. My pretty little Ceddie!” The lawyer slightly cleared throat. It touched worldly, hard old heart see tender, timid look brown eyes. “I think, madam,” said, “that I may judge interview Lord Fauntleroy morning, next Earl Dorincourt think others well noble self. He child yet, I think may trusted.” Then mother went Cedric brought back parlor. Mr. Havisham heard talking entered room. “It infam-natory rheumatism,” saying, “and kind rheumatism dreadful. And thinks rent paid, Bridget says makes inf'ammation worse. And Pat could get place store clothes.” His little face looked quite anxious came in. He sorry Bridget. “Dearest said wanted me,” said Mr. Havisham. “I talking Bridget.” Mr. Havisham looked moment. He felt little awkward undecided. As Cedric's mother said, little boy. “The Earl Dorincourt----” began, glanced involuntarily Mrs. Errol. Little Lord Fauntleroy's mother suddenly kneeled put tender arms around childish body. “Ceddie,” said, “the Earl grandpapa, papa's father. He very, kind, loves wishes love him, sons little boys dead. He wishes happy make people happy. He rich, wishes everything would like have. He told Mr. Havisham so, gave great deal money you. You give Bridget now; enough pay rent buy Michael everything. Is fine, Ceddie? Is good?” And kissed child round cheek, bright color suddenly flashed excited amazement. He looked mother Mr. Havisham. “Can I now?” cried. “Can I give minute? She going.” Mr. Havisham handed money. It fresh, clean greenbacks made neat roll. Ceddie flew room it. “Bridget!” heard shout, tore kitchen. “Bridget, wait minute! Here money. It you, pay rent. My grandpapa gave me. It Michael!” “Oh, Master Ceddie!” cried Bridget, awe-stricken voice. “It twinty-foive dollars here. Where be's misthress?” “I think I shall go explain her,” Mrs. Errol said. So she, too, went room Mr. Havisham left alone while. He went window stood looking street reflectively. He thinking old Earl Dorincourt, sitting great, splendid, gloomy library castle, gouty lonely, surrounded grandeur luxury, really loved one, long life never really loved one himself; selfish self-indulgent arrogant passionate; cared much Earl Dorincourt pleasures time think people; wealth power, benefits noble name high rank, seemed things used amuse give pleasure Earl Dorincourt; old man, excitement self-indulgence brought ill health irritability dislike world, certainly disliked him. In spite splendor, never unpopular old nobleman Earl Dorincourt, could scarcely lonely one. He could fill castle guests chose. He could give great dinners splendid hunting parties; knew secret people would accept invitations afraid frowning old face sarcastic, biting speeches. He cruel tongue bitter nature, took pleasure sneering people making feel uncomfortable, power so, sensitive proud timid. Mr. Havisham knew hard, fierce ways heart, thinking looked window narrow, quiet street. And rose mind, sharp contrast, picture cheery, handsome little fellow sitting big chair telling story friends, Dick apple-woman, generous, innocent, honest way. And thought immense income, beautiful, majestic estates, wealth, power good evil, course time would lie small, chubby hands little Lord Fauntleroy thrust deep pockets. “It make great difference,” said himself. “It make great difference.” Cedric mother came back soon after. Cedric high spirits. He sat chair, mother lawyer, fell one quaint attitudes, hands knees. He glowing enjoyment Bridget's relief rapture. “She cried!” said. “She said crying joy! I never saw one cry joy before. My grandpapa must good man. I know good man. It more--more agreeabler earl I thought was. I almost glad--I almost QUITE glad I going one.” III Cedric's good opinion advantages earl increased greatly next week. It seemed almost impossible realize scarcely anything might wish could easily; fact, I think may said fully realize all. But least understood, conversations Mr. Havisham, could gratify nearest wishes, proceeded gratify simplicity delight caused Mr. Havisham much diversion. In week sailed England many curious things. The lawyer long remembered morning went down-town together pay visit Dick, afternoon amazed apple-woman ancient lineage stopping stall telling tent, stove, shawl, sum money seemed quite wonderful. “For I go England lord,” explained Cedric, sweet-temperedly. “And I like bones mind every time rained. My bones never hurt, I think I know painful person's bones be, I sympathized great deal, I hope better.” “She good apple-woman,” said Mr. Havisham, walked away, leaving proprietress stall almost gasping breath, believing great fortune. “Once, I fell cut knee, gave apple nothing. I always remembered it. You know always remember people kind you.” It never occurred honest, simple little mind people could forget kindnesses. The interview Dick quite exciting. Dick great deal trouble Jake, low spirits saw him. His amazement Cedric calmly announced come give seemed great thing him, would set troubles right, almost struck dumb. Lord Fauntleroy's manner announcing object visit simple unceremonious. Mr. Havisham much impressed directness stood listened. The statement old friend become lord, danger earl lived long enough, caused Dick open eyes mouth, start, cap fell off. When picked up, uttered rather singular exclamation. Mr. Havisham thought singular, Cedric heard before. “I soy!” said, “what yer givin' us?” This plainly embarrassed lordship little, bore bravely. “Everybody thinks true first,” said. “Mr. Hobbs thought I would sunstroke. I think I going like myself, I like better I used it. The one Earl now, grandpapa; wants anything I like. He kind, IS earl; sent lot money Mr. Havisham, I brought buy Jake out.” And end matter Dick actually bought Jake out, found possessor business new brushes astonishing sign outfit. He could believe good luck easily apple-woman ancient lineage could believe hers; walked like boot-black dream; stared young benefactor felt might wake moment. He scarcely seemed realize anything Cedric put hand shake hands going away. “Well, good-bye,” said; though tried speak steadily, little tremble voice winked big brown eyes. “And I hope trade'll good. I sorry I going away leave you, perhaps I shall come back I earl. And I wish would write me, always good friends. And write me, must send letter.” And gave slip paper. “And name Cedric Errol more; Lord Fauntleroy and--and good-bye, Dick.” Dick winked eyes also, yet looked rather moist lashes. He educated boot-black, would found difficult tell felt tried; perhaps try, winked eyes swallowed lump throat. “I wish ye going away,” said husky voice. Then winked eyes again. Then looked Mr. Havisham, touched cap. “Thanky, sir, fur bringin' an' fur wot ye've done, He is--he queer little feller,” added. “I allers thort heap him. He game little feller, an'--an' queer little un.” And turned away stood looked dazed kind way, still mist eyes, lump throat, watched gallant little figure marching gayly along side tall, rigid escort. Until day departure, lordship spent much time possible Mr. Hobbs store. Gloom settled upon Mr. Hobbs; much depressed spirits. When young friend brought triumph parting gift gold watch chain, Mr. Hobbs found difficult acknowledge properly. He laid case stout knee, blew nose violently several times. “There something written it,” said Cedric,--“inside case. I told man say. 'From oldest friend, Lord Fauntleroy, Mr. Hobbs. When see, remember me.' I want forget me.” Mr. Hobbs blew nose loudly again. “I shall forget you,” said, speaking trifle huskily, Dick spoken; “nor go forget get among British arrystocracy.” “I forget you, whoever I among,” answered lordship. “I spent happiest hours you; least, happiest hours. I hope come see sometime. I sure grandpapa would much pleased. Perhaps write ask you, I tell you. You--you would mind earl, would you, I mean would stay away one, invited come?” “I would come see you,” replied Mr. Hobbs, graciously. So seemed agreed received pressing invitation Earl come spend months Dorincourt Castle, lay aside republican prejudices pack valise once. At last preparations complete; day came trunks taken steamer, hour arrived carriage stood door. Then curious feeling loneliness came upon little boy. His mamma shut room time; came stairs, eyes looked large wet, sweet mouth trembling. Cedric went her, bent him, put arms around her, kissed other. He knew something made sorry, though scarcely knew was; one tender little thought rose lips. “We liked little house, Dearest, we?” said. “We always like it, we?” “Yes--yes,” answered, low, sweet voice. “Yes, darling.” And went carriage Cedric sat close her, looked back window, looked stroked hand held close. And then, seemed almost directly, steamer midst wildest bustle confusion; carriages driving leaving passengers; passengers getting state excitement baggage arrived threatened late; big trunks cases bumped dragged about; sailors uncoiling ropes hurrying fro; officers giving orders; ladies gentlemen children nurses coming board,--some laughing looked gay, silent sad, two three crying touching eyes handkerchiefs. Cedric found something interest every side; looked piles rope, furled sails, tall, tall masts seemed almost touch hot blue sky; began make plans conversing sailors gaining information subject pirates. It last, standing leaning railing upper deck watching final preparations, enjoying excitement shouts sailors wharfmen, attention called slight bustle one groups far him. Some one hurriedly forcing way group coming toward him. It boy, something red hand. It Dick. He came Cedric quite breathless. “I run way,” said. “I come see ye off. Trade's prime! I bought ye I made yesterday. Ye kin wear ye get among swells. I lost paper I tryin' get fellers downstairs. They want let up. It hankercher.” He poured forth one sentence. A bell rang, made leap away Cedric time speak. “Good-bye!” panted. “Wear ye get among swells.” And darted gone. A seconds later saw struggle crowd lower deck, rush shore gang-plank drawn in. He stood wharf waved cap. Cedric held handkerchief hand. It bright red silk ornamented purple horseshoes horses' heads. There great straining creaking confusion. The people wharf began shout friends, people steamer shouted back: “Good-bye! Good-bye! Good-bye, old fellow!” Every one seemed saying, “Do forget us. Write get Liverpool. Good-bye! Good-bye!” Little Lord Fauntleroy leaned forward waved red handkerchief. “Good-bye, Dick!” shouted, lustily. “Thank you! Good-bye, Dick!” And big steamer moved away, people cheered again, Cedric's mother drew veil eyes, shore left great confusion; Dick saw nothing save bright, childish face bright hair sun shone breeze lifted, heard nothing hearty childish voice calling “Good-bye, Dick!” little Lord Fauntleroy steamed slowly away home birth unknown land ancestors. IV It voyage Cedric's mother told home hers; first understood it, grief great Mr. Havisham saw Earl wise making arrangements mother quite near him, see often; plain could borne separation otherwise. But mother managed little fellow sweetly lovingly, made feel would near him, that, while, ceased oppressed fear real parting. “My house far Castle, Ceddie,” repeated time subject referred to--“a little way yours, always run see every day, many things tell me! shall happy together! It beautiful place. Your papa often told it. He loved much; love too.” “I love better there,” small lordship said, heavy little sigh. He could feel puzzled strange state affairs, could put “Dearest” one house another. The fact Mrs. Errol thought better tell plan made. “I prefer told,” said Mr. Havisham. “He would really understand; would shocked hurt; I feel sure feeling Earl natural affectionate one know grandfather dislikes bitterly. He never seen hatred hardness, would great blow find one could hate me. He loving himself, I dear him! It better told much older, far better Earl. It would make barrier them, even though Ceddie child.” So Cedric knew mysterious reason arrangement, reason old enough understand, would explained older. He puzzled; but, all, reason cared much; many talks mother, comforted placed bright side picture, dark side gradually began fade out, though Mr. Havisham saw sitting queer little old-fashioned attitude, watching sea, grave face, heard unchildish sigh rise lips. “I like it,” said one almost venerable talks lawyer. “You know much I like it; great many troubles world, bear them. Mary says so, I heard Mr. Hobbs say too. And Dearest wants like live grandpapa, because, see, children dead, mournful. It makes sorry man, children died--and one killed suddenly.” One things always delighted people made acquaintance young lordship sage little air wore times gave conversation;--combined occasionally elderly remarks extreme innocence seriousness round childish face, irresistible. He handsome, blooming, curly-headed little fellow, that, sat nursed knee chubby hands, conversed much gravity, source great entertainment hearers. Gradually Mr. Havisham begun derive great deal private pleasure amusement society. “And going try like Earl,” said. “Yes,” answered lordship. “He relation, course like relations; besides, kind me. When person many things you, wants everything wish for, course would like relation; relation that, why, fond him.” “Do think,” suggested Mr. Havisham, “that fond you?” “Well,” said Cedric, “I think will, because, see, I relation, too, I boy's little boy besides, and, well, see--of course must fond now, would want everything I like, would sent me.” “Oh!” remarked lawyer, “that it, it?” “Yes,” said Cedric, “that it. Do think it, too? Of course man would fond grandson.” The people seasick sooner recovered seasickness, come deck recline steamer-chairs enjoy themselves, every one seemed know romantic story little Lord Fauntleroy, every one took interest little fellow, ran ship walked mother tall, thin old lawyer, talked sailors. Every one liked him; made friends everywhere. He ever ready make friends. When gentlemen walked deck, let walk them, stepped manly, sturdy little tramp, answered jokes much gay enjoyment; ladies talked him, always laughter group center; played children, always magnificent fun hand. Among sailors heartiest friends; heard miraculous stories pirates shipwrecks desert islands; learned splice ropes rig toy ships, gained amount information concerning “tops'ls” “mains'ls,” quite surprising. His conversation had, indeed, quite nautical flavor times, one occasion raised shout laughter group ladies gentlemen sitting deck, wrapped shawls overcoats, saying sweetly, engaging expression: “Shiver timbers, cold day!” It surprised laughed. He picked sea-faring remark “elderly naval man” name Jerry, told stories occurred frequently. To judge stories adventures, Jerry made two three thousand voyages, invariably shipwrecked occasion island densely populated bloodthirsty cannibals. Judging, also, exciting adventures, partially roasted eaten frequently scalped fifteen twenty times. “That bald,” explained Lord Fauntleroy mamma. “After scalped several times hair never grows again. Jerry's never grew last time, King Parromachaweekins knife made skull Chief Wopslemumpkies. He says one serious times ever had. He frightened hair stood right straight king flourished knife, never would lie down, king wears way now, looks something like hair-brush. I never heard anything like asperiences Jerry had! I like tell Mr. Hobbs them!” Sometimes, weather disagreeable people kept decks saloon, party grown-up friends would persuade tell “asperiences” Jerry's, sat relating great delight fervor, certainly popular voyager ocean steamer crossing Atlantic little Lord Fauntleroy. He always innocently good-naturedly ready small best add general entertainment, charm unconsciousness childish importance. “Jerry's stories int'rust much,” said mamma. “For part--you must excuse me, Dearest--but sometimes I thought could quite true, happened Jerry himself; happened Jerry--well, strange, know, perhaps sometimes may forget little mistaken, scalped often. Being scalped great many times might make person forgetful.” It eleven days said good-bye friend Dick reached Liverpool; night twelfth day carriage mother Mr. Havisham driven station stopped gates Court Lodge. They could see much house darkness. Cedric saw drive-way great arching trees, carriage rolled drive-way short distance, saw open door stream bright light coming it. Mary come attend mistress, reached house them. When Cedric jumped carriage saw one two servants standing wide, bright hall, Mary stood door-way. Lord Fauntleroy sprang gay little shout. “Did get here, Mary?” said. “Here Mary, Dearest,” kissed maid rough red cheek. “I glad here, Mary,” Mrs. Errol said low voice. “It comfort see you. It takes strangeness away.” And held little hand, Mary squeezed encouragingly. She knew first “strangeness” must feel little mother left land give child. The English servants looked curiosity boy mother. They heard sorts rumors both; knew angry old Earl been, Mrs. Errol live lodge little boy castle; knew great fortune inherit, savage old grandfather gout tempers. “He easy time it, poor little chap,” said among themselves. But know sort little lord come among them; quite understand character next Earl Dorincourt. He pulled overcoat quite used things himself, began look him. He looked broad hall, pictures stags' antlers curious things ornamented it. They seemed curious never seen things private house. “Dearest,” said, “this pretty house, it? I glad going live here. It quite large house.” It quite large house compared one shabby New York street, pretty cheerful. Mary led upstairs bright chintz-hung bedroom fire burning, large snow-white Persian cat sleeping luxuriously white fur hearth-rug. “It house-kaper Castle, madam, sint yez,” explained Mary. “It kind-hearted lady an' iverything done prepar' fur yez. I seen meself minnits, an' fond av Capt'in, madam, an' graivs fur him; said say big cat slapin' rug moight make room homeloike yez. She knowed Capt'in Errol whin bye--an' foine handsum' bye ses was, an' foine young man wid plisint word fur every one, great an' shmall. An' ses I her, ses I: 'He lift bye loike him, madam, fur foiner little felly niver sthipped shoe-leather.”' When ready, went downstairs another big bright room; ceiling low, furniture heavy beautifully carved, chairs deep high massive backs, queer shelves cabinets strange, pretty ornaments them. There great tiger-skin fire, arm-chair side it. The stately white cat responded Lord Fauntleroy's stroking followed downstairs, threw upon rug, curled grandly beside intended make friends. Cedric pleased put head hers, lay stroking her, noticing mother Mr. Havisham saying. They were, indeed, speaking rather low tone. Mrs. Errol looked little pale agitated. “He need go to-night?” said. “He stay to-night?” “Yes,” answered Mr. Havisham low tone; “it necessary go to-night. I go Castle soon dined, inform Earl arrival.” Mrs. Errol glanced Cedric. He lying graceful, careless attitude upon black-and-yellow skin; fire shone handsome, flushed little face, tumbled, curly hair spread rug; big cat purring drowsy content,--she liked caressing touch kind little hand fur. Mrs. Errol smiled faintly. “His lordship know taking me,” said rather sadly. Then looked lawyer. “Will tell him, please,” said, “that I rather money?” “The money!” Mr. Havisham exclaimed. “You mean income proposed settle upon you!” “Yes,” answered, quite simply; “I think I rather it. I obliged accept house, I thank it, makes possible near child; I little money own,--enough live simply upon,--and I rather take other. As dislikes much, I feel little I selling Cedric him. I giving I love enough forget good, father would wish so.” Mr. Havisham rubbed chin. “This strange,” said. “He angry. He understand it.” “I think understand thinks over,” said. “I really need money, I accept luxuries man hates much takes little boy me--his son's child?” Mr. Havisham looked reflective moments. “I deliver message,” said afterward. And dinner brought sat together, big cat taking seat chair near Cedric's purring majestically throughout meal. When, later evening, Mr. Havisham presented Castle, taken Earl. He found sitting fire luxurious easy-chair, foot gout-stool. He looked lawyer sharply shaggy eyebrows, Mr. Havisham could see that, spite pretense calmness, nervous secretly excited. “Well,” said; “well, Havisham, come back, you? What news?” “Lord Fauntleroy mother Court Lodge,” replied Mr. Havisham. “They bore voyage well excellent health.” The Earl made half-impatient sound moved hand restlessly. “Glad hear it,” said brusquely. “So far, good. Make comfortable. Have glass wine settle down. What else?” “His lordship remains mother to-night. To-morrow I bring Castle.” The Earl's elbow resting arm chair; put hand shielded eyes it. “Well,” said; “go on. You know I told write matter, I know nothing whatever it. What kind lad he? I care mother; sort lad he?” Mr. Havisham drank little glass port poured himself, sat holding hand. “It rather difficult judge character child seven,” said cautiously. The Earl's prejudices intense. He looked quickly uttered rough word. “A fool, he?” exclaimed. “Or clumsy cub? His American blood tells, it?” “I think injured him, lord,” replied lawyer dry, deliberate fashion. “I know much children, I thought rather fine lad.” His manner speech always deliberate unenthusiastic, made trifle usual. He shrewd fancy would better Earl judge himself, quite unprepared first interview grandson. “Healthy well-grown?” asked lord. “Apparently healthy, quite well-grown,” replied lawyer. “Straight-limbed well enough look at?” demanded Earl. A slight smile touched Mr. Havisham's thin lips. There rose mind's eye picture left Court Lodge,--the beautiful, graceful child's body lying upon tiger-skin careless comfort--the bright, tumbled hair spread rug--the bright, rosy boy's face. “Rather handsome boy, I think, lord, boys go,” said, “though I scarcely judge, perhaps. But find somewhat different English children, I dare say.” “I doubt that,” snarled Earl, twinge gout seizing him. “A lot impudent little beggars, American children; I heard often enough.” “It exactly impudence case,” said Mr. Havisham. “I scarcely describe difference is. He lived older people children, difference seems mixture maturity childishness.” “American impudence!” protested Earl. “I heard before. They call precocity freedom. Beastly, impudent bad manners; is!” Mr. Havisham drank port. He seldom argued lordly patron,--never lordly patron's noble leg inflamed gout. At times always better leave alone. So silence moments. It Mr. Havisham broke it. “I message deliver Mrs. Errol,” remarked. “I want messages!” growled lordship; “the less I hear better.” “This rather important one,” explained lawyer. “She prefers accept income proposed settle her.” The Earl started visibly. “What that?” cried out. “What that?” Mr. Havisham repeated words. “She says necessary, relations friendly----” “Not friendly!” ejaculated lord savagely; “I say friendly! I hate think her! A mercenary, sharp-voiced American! I wish see her.” “My lord,” said Mr. Havisham, “you scarcely call mercenary. She asked nothing. She accept money offer her.” “All done effect!” snapped noble lordship. “She wants wheedle seeing her. She thinks I shall admire spirit. I admire it! It American independence! I living like beggar park gates. As boy's mother, position keep up, shall keep up. She shall money, whether likes not!” “She spend it,” said Mr. Havisham. “I care whether spends not!” blustered lord. “She shall sent her. She shall tell people live like pauper I done nothing her! She wants give boy bad opinion me! I suppose poisoned mind already!” “No,” said Mr. Havisham. “I another message, prove done that.” “I want hear it!” panted Earl, breath anger excitement gout. But Mr. Havisham delivered it. “She asks let Lord Fauntleroy hear anything would lead understand separate prejudice her. He fond her, convinced would barrier exist you. She says would comprehend it, might make fear measure, least feel less affection you. She told young understand reason, shall hear older. She wishes shadow first meeting.” The Earl sank back chair. His deep-set fierce old eyes gleamed beetling brows. “Come, now!” said, still breathlessly. “Come, now! You mean mother told him?” “Not one word, lord,” replied lawyer coolly. “That I assure you. The child prepared believe amiable affectionate grandparents. Nothing--absolutely nothing said give slightest doubt perfection. And I carried commands every detail, New York, certainly regards wonder generosity.” “He does, eh?” said Earl. “I give word honor,” said Mr. Havisham, “that Lord Fauntleroy's impressions depend entirely upon yourself. And pardon liberty I take making suggestion, I think succeed better take precaution speak slightingly mother.” “Pooh, pooh!” said Earl. “The youngster seven years old!” “He spent seven years mother's side,” returned Mr. Havisham; “and affection.” V It late afternoon carriage containing little Lord Fauntleroy Mr. Havisham drove long avenue led castle. The Earl given orders grandson arrive time dine him; reason best known himself, also ordered child sent alone room intended receive him. As carriage rolled avenue, Lord Fauntleroy sat leaning comfortably luxurious cushions, regarded prospect great interest. He was, fact, interested everything saw. He interested carriage, large, splendid horses glittering harness; interested tall coachman footman, resplendent livery; especially interested coronet panels, struck acquaintance footman purpose inquiring meant. When carriage reached great gates park, looked window get good view huge stone lions ornamenting entrance. The gates opened motherly, rosy-looking woman, came pretty, ivy-covered lodge. Two children ran door house stood looking round, wide-open eyes little boy carriage, looked also. Their mother stood courtesying smiling, children, receiving sign her, made bobbing little courtesies too. “Does know me?” asked Lord Fauntleroy. “I think must think knows me.” And took black velvet cap smiled. “How do?” said brightly. “Good-afternoon!” The woman seemed pleased, thought. The smile broadened rosy face kind look came blue eyes. “God bless lordship!” said. “God bless pretty face! Good luck happiness lordship! Welcome you!” Lord Fauntleroy waved cap nodded carriage rolled her. “I like woman,” said. “She looks liked boys. I like come play children. I wonder enough make company?” Mr. Havisham tell would scarcely allowed make playmates gate-keeper's children. The lawyer thought time enough giving information. The carriage rolled great, beautiful trees grew side avenue stretched broad, swaying branches arch across it. Cedric never seen trees,--they grand stately, branches grew low huge trunks. He know Dorincourt Castle one beautiful England; park one broadest finest, trees avenue almost without rivals. But know beautiful. He liked big, broad-branched trees, late afternoon sunlight striking golden lances them. He liked perfect stillness rested everything. He felt great, strange pleasure beauty caught glimpses sweeping boughs--the great, beautiful spaces park, still trees standing sometimes stately alone, sometimes groups. Now passed places tall ferns grew masses, ground azure bluebells swaying soft breeze. Several times started laugh delight rabbit leaped greenery scudded away twinkle short white tail behind it. Once covey partridges rose sudden whir flew away, shouted clapped hands. “It beautiful place, it?” said Mr. Havisham. “I never saw beautiful place. It prettier even Central Park.” He rather puzzled length time way. “How far it,” said, length, “from gate front door?” “It three four miles,” answered lawyer. “That long way person live gate,” remarked lordship. Every minutes saw something new wonder admire. When caught sight deer, couched grass, standing pretty antlered heads turned half-startled air toward avenue carriage wheels disturbed them, enchanted. “Has circus?” cried; “or live always? Whose they?” “They live here,” Mr. Havisham told him. “They belong Earl, grandfather.” It long saw castle. It rose stately beautiful gray, last rays sun casting dazzling lights many windows. It turrets battlements towers; great deal ivy grew upon walls; broad, open space laid terraces lawns beds brilliant flowers. “It beautiful place I ever saw!” said Cedric, round face flushing pleasure. “It reminds one king's palace. I saw picture one fairy-book.” He saw great entrance-door thrown open many servants standing two lines looking him. He wondered standing there, admired liveries much. He know honor little boy splendor would one day belong,--the beautiful castle like fairy king's palace, magnificent park, grand old trees, dells full ferns bluebells hares rabbits played, dappled, large-eyed deer couching deep grass. It couple weeks since sat Mr. Hobbs among potatoes canned peaches, legs dangling high stool; would possible realize much grandeur. At head line servants stood elderly woman rich, plain black silk gown; gray hair wore cap. As entered hall stood nearer rest, child thought look eyes going speak him. Mr. Havisham, held hand, paused moment. “This Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon,” said. “Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon, housekeeper.” Cedric gave hand, eyes lighting up. “Was sent cat?” said. “I much obliged you, madam.” Mrs. Mellon's handsome old face looked pleased face lodge-keeper's wife done. “I know lordship anywhere,” said Mr. Havisham. “He Captain's face way. It great day, this, sir.” Cedric wondered great day. He looked Mrs. Mellon curiously. It seemed moment tears eyes, yet evident unhappy. She smiled him. “The cat left two beautiful kittens here,” said; “they shall sent lordship's nursery.” Mr. Havisham said words low voice. “In library, sir,” Mrs. Mellon replied. “His lordship taken alone.” A minutes later, tall footman livery, escorted Cedric library door, opened announced: “Lord Fauntleroy, lord,” quite majestic tone. If footman, felt rather grand occasion heir came home land possessions, ushered presence old Earl, whose place title take. Cedric crossed threshold room. It large splendid room, massive carven furniture it, shelves upon shelves books; furniture dark, draperies heavy, diamond-paned windows deep, seemed distance one end other, that, since sun gone down, effect rather gloomy. For moment Cedric thought nobody room, soon saw fire burning wide hearth large easy-chair chair one sitting--some one first turn look him. But attracted attention one quarter least. On floor, arm-chair, lay dog, huge tawny mastiff, body limbs almost big lion's; great creature rose majestically slowly, marched toward little fellow heavy step. Then person chair spoke. “Dougal,” called, “come back, sir.” But fear little Lord Fauntleroy's heart unkindness--he brave little fellow life. He put hand big dog's collar natural way world, strayed forward together, Dougal sniffing went. And Earl looked up. What Cedric saw large old man shaggy white hair eyebrows, nose like eagle's beak deep, fierce eyes. What Earl saw graceful, childish figure black velvet suit, lace collar, love-locks waving handsome, manly little face, whose eyes met look innocent good-fellowship. If Castle like palace fairy story, must owned little Lord Fauntleroy rather like small copy fairy prince, though aware fact, perhaps rather sturdy young model fairy. But sudden glow triumph exultation fiery old Earl's heart saw strong, beautiful boy grandson was, unhesitatingly looked stood hand big dog's neck. It pleased grim old nobleman child show shyness fear, either dog himself. Cedric looked looked woman lodge housekeeper, came quite close him. “Are Earl?” said. “I grandson, know, Mr. Havisham brought. I Lord Fauntleroy.” He held hand thought must polite proper thing even earls. “I hope well,” continued, utmost friendliness. “I glad see you.” The Earl shook hands him, curious gleam eyes; first, astonished scarcely knew say. He stared picturesque little apparition shaggy brows, took head foot. “Glad see me, you?” said. “Yes,” answered Lord Fauntleroy, “very.” There chair near him, sat it; high-backed, rather tall chair, feet touch floor settled it, seemed quite comfortable sat there, regarded august relative intently modestly. “I kept wondering would look like,” remarked. “I used lie berth ship wonder would anything like father.” “Am I?” asked Earl. “Well,” Cedric replied, “I young died, I may remember exactly looked, I think like him.” “You disappointed, I suppose?” suggested grandfather. “Oh, no,” responded Cedric politely. “Of course would like one look like father; course would enjoy way grandfather looked, even like father. You know admiring relations.” The Earl leaned back chair stared. He could said know admiring relations. He employed noble leisure quarreling violently them, turning house, applying abusive epithets them; hated cordially. “Any boy would love grandfather,” continued Lord Fauntleroy, “especially one kind been.” Another queer gleam came old nobleman's eyes. “Oh!” said, “I kind you, I?” “Yes,” answered Lord Fauntleroy brightly; “I ever much obliged Bridget, apple-woman, Dick.” “Bridget!” exclaimed Earl. “Dick! The apple-woman!” “Yes!” explained Cedric; “the ones gave money for--the money told Mr. Havisham give I wanted it.” “Ha!” ejaculated lordship. “That it, it? The money spend liked. What buy it? I like hear something that.” He drew shaggy eyebrows together looked child sharply. He secretly curious know way lad indulged himself. “Oh!” said Lord Fauntleroy, “perhaps know Dick apple-woman Bridget. I forgot lived long way them. They particular friends mine. And see Michael fever----” “Who Michael?” asked Earl. “Michael Bridget's husband, great trouble. When man sick cannot work twelve children, know is. And Michael always sober man. And Bridget used come house cry. And evening Mr. Havisham there, kitchen crying, almost nothing eat could pay rent; I went see her, Mr. Havisham sent said given money me. And I ran fast I could kitchen gave Bridget; made right; Bridget could scarcely believe eyes. That I obliged you.” “Oh!” said Earl deep voice, “that one things yourself, it? What else?” Dougal sitting tall chair; great dog taken place Cedric sat down. Several times turned looked boy interested conversation. Dougal solemn dog, seemed feel altogether big take life's responsibilities lightly. The old Earl, knew dog well, watched secret interest. Dougal dog whose habit make acquaintances rashly, Earl wondered somewhat see quietly brute sat touch childish hand. And, moment, big dog gave little Lord Fauntleroy one look dignified scrutiny, deliberately laid huge, lion-like head boy's black-velvet knee. The small hand went stroking new friend Cedric answered: “Well, Dick,” said. “You would like Dick, square.” This Americanism Earl prepared for. “What mean?” inquired. Lord Fauntleroy paused moment reflect. He sure meant. He taken granted meaning something creditable Dick fond using it. “I think means would cheat one,” exclaimed; “or hit boy size, blacks people's boots well makes shine much can. He perfessional bootblack.” “And one acquaintances, he?” said Earl. “He old friend mine,” replied grandson. “Not quite old Mr. Hobbs, quite old. He gave present ship sailed.” He put hand pocket drew forth neatly folded red object opened air affectionate pride. It red silk handkerchief large purple horse-shoes heads it. “He gave this,” said young lordship. “I shall keep always. You wear round neck keep pocket. He bought first money earned I bought Jake gave new brushes. It keepsake. I put poetry Mr. Hobbs's watch. It was, 'When see, remember me.' When I see, I shall always remember Dick.” The sensations Right Honorable Earl Dorincourt could scarcely described. He old nobleman easily bewildered, seen great deal world; something found novel almost took lordly breath away, caused singular emotions. He never cared children; occupied pleasures never time care them. His sons interested young--though sometimes remembered thought Cedric's father handsome strong little fellow. He selfish missed pleasure seeing unselfishness others, known tender faithful affectionate kind-hearted little child be, innocent unconscious simple, generous impulses. A boy always seemed objectionable little animal, selfish greedy boisterous strict restraint; two eldest sons given tutors constant trouble annoyance, younger one fancied heard complaints boy particular importance. It never occurred like grandson; sent little Cedric pride impelled so. If boy take place future, wish name made ridiculous descending uneducated boor. He convinced boy would clownish fellow brought America. He feeling affection lad; hope find decently well-featured, respectable share sense; disappointed sons, made furious Captain Errol's American marriage, never thought anything creditable could come it. When footman announced Lord Fauntleroy, almost dreaded look boy lest find feared. It feeling ordered child sent alone. His pride could endure others see disappointment disappointed. His proud, stubborn old heart therefore leaped within boy came forward graceful, easy carriage, fearless hand big dog's neck. Even moments hoped most, Earl never hoped grandson would look like that. It seemed almost good true boy dreaded see--the child woman disliked--this little fellow much beauty brave, childish grace! The Earl's stern composure quite shaken startling surprise. And talk began; still curiously moved, puzzled. In first place, used seeing people rather afraid embarrassed him, expected nothing else grandson would timid shy. But Cedric afraid Earl Dougal. He bold; innocently friendly, conscious could reason awkward afraid. The Earl could help seeing little boy took friend treated one, without doubt all. It quite plain little fellow sat tall chair talked friendly way never occurred large, fierce-looking old man could anything kind him, rather pleased see there. And plain, too, that, childish way, wished please interest grandfather. Cross, hard-hearted, worldly old Earl was, could help feeling secret novel pleasure confidence. After all, disagreeable meet one distrust shrink him, seem detect ugly part nature; one looked clear, unsuspecting eyes,--if little boy black velvet suit. So old man leaned back chair, led young companion telling still himself, odd gleam eyes watched little fellow talked. Lord Fauntleroy quite willing answer questions chatted genial little way quite composedly. He told Dick Jake, apple-woman, Mr. Hobbs; described Republican Rally glory banners transparencies, torches rockets. In course conversation, reached Fourth July Revolution, becoming enthusiastic, suddenly recollected something stopped abruptly. “What matter?” demanded grandfather. “Why go on?” Lord Fauntleroy moved rather uneasily chair. It evident Earl embarrassed thought occurred him. “I thinking perhaps might like it,” replied. “Perhaps one belonging might there. I forgot Englishman.” “You go on,” said lord. “No one belonging there. You forgot Englishman, too.” “Oh! no,” said Cedric quickly. “I American!” “You Englishman,” said Earl grimly. “Your father Englishman.” It amused little say this, amuse Cedric. The lad never thought development this. He felt grow quite hot roots hair. “I born America,” protested. “You American born America. I beg pardon,” serious politeness delicacy, “for contradicting you. Mr. Hobbs told me, another war, know, I to--to American.” The Earl gave grim half laugh--it short grim, laugh. “You would, would you?” said. He hated America Americans, amused see serious interested small patriot was. He thought good American might make rather good Englishman man. They time go deep Revolution again--and indeed Lord Fauntleroy felt delicacy returning subject--before dinner announced. Cedric left chair went noble kinsman. He looked gouty foot. “Would like help you?” said politely. “You could lean me, know. Once Mr. Hobbs hurt foot potato-barrel rolling it, used lean me.” The big footman almost periled reputation situation smiling. He aristocratic footman always lived best noble families, never smiled; indeed, would felt disgraced vulgar footman allowed led circumstance whatever indiscretion smile. But narrow escape. He saved staring straight Earl's head ugly picture. The Earl looked valiant young relative head foot. “Do think could it?” asked gruffly. “I THINK I could,” said Cedric. “I strong. I seven, know. You could lean stick one side, other. Dick says I good deal muscle boy seven.” He shut hand moved upward shoulder, Earl might see muscle Dick kindly approved of, face grave earnest footman found necessary look hard indeed ugly picture. “Well,” said Earl, “you may try.” Cedric gave stick began assist rise. Usually, footman this, violently sworn lordship extra twinge gout. The Earl polite person rule, many time huge footmen quaked inside imposing liveries. But evening swear, though gouty foot gave twinges one. He chose try experiment. He got slowly put hand small shoulder presented much courage. Little Lord Fauntleroy made careful step forward, looking gouty foot. “Just lean me,” said, encouraging good cheer. “I walk slowly.” If Earl supported footman would rested less stick assistant's arm. And yet part experiment let grandson feel burden light weight. It quite heavy weight indeed, steps young lordship's face grew quite hot, heart beat rather fast, braced sturdily, remembering muscle Dick's approval it. “Do afraid leaning me,” panted. “I right--if--if long way.” It really far dining-room, seemed rather long way Cedric, reached chair head table. The hand shoulder seemed grow heavier every step, face grew redder hotter, breath shorter, never thought giving up; stiffened childish muscles, held head erect, encouraged Earl limped along. “Does foot hurt much stand it?” asked. “Did ever put hot water mustard? Mr. Hobbs used put hot water. Arnica nice thing, tell me.” The big dog stalked slowly beside them, big footman followed; several times looked queer watched little figure making strength, bearing burden good-will. The Earl, too, looked rather queer, once, glanced sidewise flushed little face. When entered room dine, Cedric saw large imposing one, footman stood behind chair head table stared hard came in. But reached chair last. The hand removed shoulder, Earl fairly seated. Cedric took Dick's handkerchief wiped forehead. “It warm night, it?” said. “Perhaps need fire because--because foot, seems little warm me.” His delicate consideration noble relative's feelings wish seem intimate surroundings unnecessary. “You rather hard work,” said Earl. “Oh, no!” said Lord Fauntleroy, “it exactly hard, I got little warm. A person get warm summer time.” And rubbed damp curls rather vigorously gorgeous handkerchief. His chair placed end table, opposite grandfather's. It chair arms, intended much larger individual himself; indeed, everything seen far,--the great rooms, high ceilings, massive furniture, big footman, big dog, Earl himself,--were proportions calculated make little lad feel small, indeed. But trouble him; never thought large important, quite willing accommodate even circumstances rather overpowered him. Perhaps never looked little fellow seated great chair, end table. Notwithstanding solitary existence, Earl chose live state. He fond dinner, dined formal style. Cedric looked across glitter splendid glass plate, unaccustomed eyes seemed quite dazzling. A stranger looking might well smiled picture,--the great stately room, big liveried servants, bright lights, glittering silver glass, fierce-looking old nobleman head table small boy foot. Dinner usually serious matter Earl--and serious matter cook, lordship pleased indifferent appetite. To-day, however, appetite seemed trifle better usual, perhaps something think beside flavor entrees management gravies. His grandson gave something think of. He kept looking across table. He say much himself, managed make boy talk. He never imagined could entertained hearing child talk, Lord Fauntleroy puzzled amused him, kept remembering let childish shoulder feel weight sake trying far boy's courage endurance would go, pleased know grandson quailed seemed think even moment giving undertaken do. “You wear coronet time?” remarked Lord Fauntleroy respectfully. “No,” replied Earl, grim smile; “it becoming me.” “Mr. Hobbs said always wore it,” said Cedric; “but thought over, said supposed must sometimes take put hat on.” “Yes,” said Earl, “I take occasionally.” And one footmen suddenly turned aside gave singular little cough behind hand. Cedric finished dinner first, leaned back chair took survey room. “You must proud house,” said, “it beautiful house. I never saw anything beautiful; but, course, I seven, I seen much.” “And think I must proud it, you?” said Earl. “I think one would proud it,” replied Lord Fauntleroy. “I proud house. Everything beautiful. And park, trees,--how beautiful are, leaves rustle!” Then paused instant looked across table rather wistfully. “It big house two people live in, it?” said. “It quite large enough two,” answered Earl. “Do find large?” His little lordship hesitated moment. “I thinking,” said, “that two people lived good companions, might feel lonely sometimes.” “Do think I shall make good companion?” inquired Earl. “Yes,” replied Cedric, “I think will. Mr. Hobbs I great friends. He best friend I except Dearest.” The Earl made quick movement bushy eyebrows. “Who Dearest?” “She mother,” said Lord Fauntleroy, rather low, quiet little voice. Perhaps trifle tired, bed-time nearing, perhaps excitement last days natural tired, perhaps, too, feeling weariness brought vague sense loneliness remembrance to-night sleep home, watched loving eyes “best friend” his. They always “best friends,” boy young mother. He could help thinking her, thought less inclined talk, time dinner end Earl saw faint shadow face. But Cedric bore excellent courage, went back library, though tall footman walked one side master, Earl's hand rested grandson's shoulder, though heavily before. When footman left alone, Cedric sat upon hearth-rug near Dougal. For minutes stroked dog's ears silence looked fire. The Earl watched him. The boy's eyes looked wistful thoughtful, twice gave little sigh. The Earl sat still, kept eyes fixed grandson. “Fauntleroy,” said last, “what thinking of?” Fauntleroy looked manful effort smile. “I thinking Dearest,” said; “and--and I think I would better get walk room.” He rose up, put hands small pockets, began walk fro. His eyes bright, lips pressed together, kept head walked firmly. Dougal moved lazily looked him, stood up. He walked child, began follow uneasily. Fauntleroy drew one hand pocket laid dog's head. “He nice dog,” said. “He friend. He knows I feel.” “How feel?” asked Earl. It disturbed see struggle little fellow first feeling homesickness, pleased see making brave effort bear well. He liked childish courage. “Come here,” said. Fauntleroy went him. “I never away house before,” said boy, troubled look brown eyes. “It makes person feel strange feeling stay night another person's castle instead house. But Dearest far away me. She told remember that--and--and I seven--and I look picture gave me.” He put hand pocket, brought small violet velvet-covered case. “This it,” said. “You see, press spring opens, there!” He come close Earl's chair, and, drew forth little case, leaned arm it, old man's arm, too, confidingly children always leaned there. “There is,” said, case opened; looked smile. The Earl knitted brows; wish see picture, looked spite himself; looked pretty young face--a face like child's side--that quite startled him. “I suppose think fond her,” said. “Yes,” answered Lord Fauntleroy, gentle tone, simple directness; “I think so, I think true. You see, Mr. Hobbs friend, Dick Bridget Mary Michael, friends, too; Dearest--well, CLOSE friend, always tell everything. My father left take care of, I man I going work earn money her.” “What think doing?” inquired grandfather. His young lordship slipped upon hearth-rug, sat picture still hand. He seemed reflecting seriously, answered. “I think perhaps I might go business Mr. Hobbs,” said; “but I LIKE President.” “We send House Lords instead,” said grandfather. “Well,” remarked Lord Fauntleroy, “if I COULD NOT President, good business, I mind. The grocery business dull sometimes.” Perhaps weighing matter mind, sat quiet this, looked fire time. The Earl speak again. He leaned back chair watched him. A great many strange new thoughts passed old nobleman's mind. Dougal stretched gone sleep head huge paws. There long silence. In half hour's time Mr. Havisham ushered in. The great room still entered. The Earl still leaning back chair. He moved Mr. Havisham approached, held hand gesture warning--it seemed scarcely intended make gesture--as almost involuntary. Dougal still asleep, close beside great dog, sleeping also, curly head upon arm, lay little Lord Fauntleroy. VI When Lord Fauntleroy wakened morning,--he wakened carried bed night before,--the first sounds conscious crackling wood fire murmur voices. “You careful, Dawson, say anything it,” heard one say. “He know him, reason kept him.” “If them's lordship's orders, mem,” another voice answered, “they kep', I suppose. But, excuse liberty, mem, ourselves, servant servant, I say is, cruel thing,--parting poor, pretty, young widdered cre'tur' flesh blood, little beauty nobleman born. James Thomas, mem, last night servants' hall, say never see anythink two lives--nor yet gentleman livery--like little fellow's ways, innercent an' polite an' interested would sitting dining best friend,--and temper a' angel, instead one (if excuse me, mem), well known, enough curdle blood veins times. And looks, mem, rung for, James me, go library bring upstairs, James lifted arms, little innercent face red rosy, little head James's shoulder hair hanging down, curly an' shinin', prettier, takiner sight would never wish see. An' opinion, lord blind neither, looked him, says James, 'See wake him!' says.” Cedric moved pillow, turned over, opening eyes. There two women room. Everything bright cheerful gay-flowered chintz. There fire hearth, sunshine streaming ivy-entwined windows. Both women came toward him, saw one Mrs. Mellon, housekeeper, comfortable, middle-aged woman, face kind good-humored face could be. “Good-morning, lord,” said Mrs. Mellon. “Did sleep well?” His lordship rubbed eyes smiled. “Good-morning,” said. “I know I here.” “You carried upstairs asleep,” said housekeeper. “This bedroom, Dawson, take care you.” Fauntleroy sat bed held hand Dawson, held Earl. “How do, madam?” said. “I much obliged coming take care me.” “You call Dawson, lord,” said housekeeper smile. “She used called Dawson.” “MISS Dawson, MRS. Dawson?” inquired lordship. “Just Dawson, lord,” said Dawson herself, beaming over. “Neither Miss Missis, bless little heart! Will get now, let Dawson dress you, breakfast nursery?” “I learned dress many years ago, thank you,” answered Fauntleroy. “Dearest taught me. 'Dearest' mamma. We Mary work,--washing all,--and course would give much trouble. I take bath, too, pretty well kind enough 'zamine corners I done.” Dawson housekeeper exchanged glances. “Dawson anything ask to,” said Mrs. Mellon. “That I will, bless him,” said Dawson, comforting, good-humored voice. “He shall dress likes, I stand by, ready help wants me.” “Thank you,” responded Lord Fauntleroy; “it little hard sometimes buttons, know, I ask somebody.” He thought Dawson kind woman, bath dressing finished excellent friends, found great deal her. He discovered husband soldier killed real battle, son sailor, away long cruise, seen pirates cannibals Chinese people Turks, brought home strange shells pieces coral Dawson ready show moment, trunk. All interesting. He also found taken care little children life, come great house another part England, taking care beautiful little girl whose name Lady Gwyneth Vaughn. “And sort relation lordship's,” said Dawson. “And perhaps sometime may see her.” “Do think I shall?” said Fauntleroy. “I like that. I never knew little girls, I always like look them.” When went adjoining room take breakfast, saw great room was, found another adjoining Dawson told also, feeling small indeed came strongly confided Dawson, sat table pretty breakfast service arranged. “I little boy,” said rather wistfully, “to live large castle, many big rooms,--do think so?” “Oh! come!” said Dawson, “you feel little strange first, all; get soon, like here. It beautiful place, know.” “It beautiful place, course,” said Fauntleroy, little sigh; “but I like better I miss Dearest so. I always breakfast morning, put sugar cream tea her, handed toast. That made sociable, course.” “Oh, well!” answered Dawson, comfortingly, “you know see every day, knowing much tell her. Bless you! wait till walked bit seen things,--the dogs, stables horses them. There one I know like see----” “Is there?” exclaimed Fauntleroy; “I fond horses. I fond Jim. He horse belonged Mr. Hobbs' grocery wagon. He beautiful horse balky.” “Well,” said Dawson, “you wait till seen stables. And, deary me, looked even next room yet!” “What there?” asked Fauntleroy. “Wait breakfast, shall see,” said Dawson. At naturally began grow curious, applied assiduously breakfast. It seemed must something worth looking at, next room; Dawson consequential, mysterious air. “Now, then,” said, slipping seat minutes later; “I enough. Can I go look it?” Dawson nodded led way, looking mysterious important ever. He began much interested indeed. When opened door room, stood upon threshold looked amazement. He speak; put hands pockets stood flushing forehead looking in. He flushed surprised and, moment, excited. To see place enough surprise ordinary boy. The room large one, too, rooms seemed be, appeared beautiful rest, different way. The furniture massive antique rooms seen downstairs; draperies rugs walls brighter; shelves full books, tables numbers toys,--beautiful, ingenious things,--such looked wonder delight shop windows New York. “It looks like boy's room,” said last, catching breath little. “Whom belong to?” “Go look them,” said Dawson. “They belong you!” “To me!” cried; “to me? Why belong me? Who gave me?” And sprang forward gay little shout. It seemed almost much believed. “It Grandpapa!” said, eyes bright stars. “I know Grandpapa!” “Yes, lordship,” said Dawson; “and nice little gentleman, fret things, enjoy yourself, happy day, give anything ask for.” It tremendously exciting morning. There many things examined, many experiments tried; novelty absorbing could scarcely turn look next. And curious know prepared alone; that, even left New York, people come London arrange rooms occupy, provided books playthings likely interest him. “Did ever know one,” said Dawson, “who kind grandfather!” Dawson's face wore uncertain expression moment. She high opinion lordship Earl. She house many days, long enough hear old nobleman's peculiarities discussed freely servants' hall. “An' wicious, savage, hill-tempered hold fellows ever hill-luck wear livery hunder,” tallest footman said, “he wiolentest wust long shot.” And particular footman, whose name Thomas, also repeated companions stairs Earl's remarks Mr. Havisham, discussing preparations. “Give way, fill rooms toys,” lord said. “Give amuse him, forget mother quickly enough. Amuse him, fill mind things, shall trouble. That boy nature.” So, perhaps, truly amiable object view, please much find seem exactly particular boy's nature. The Earl passed bad night spent morning room; noon, lunched, sent grandson. Fauntleroy answered summons once. He came broad staircase bounding step; Earl heard run across hall, door opened came red cheeks sparkling eyes. “I waiting send me,” said. “I ready long time ago. I EVER much obliged things! I EVER much obliged you! I playing morning.” “Oh!” said Earl, “you like them, you?” “I like much--well, I could tell much!” said Fauntleroy, face glowing delight. “There one like baseball, play board black white pegs, keep score counters wire. I tried teach Dawson, could quite understand first--you see, never played baseball, lady; I afraid I good explaining her. But know it, you?” “I afraid I not,” replied Earl. “It American game, it? Is something like cricket?” “I never saw cricket,” said Fauntleroy; “but Mr. Hobbs took several times see baseball. It splendid game. You get excited! Would like go get game show you? Perhaps would amuse make forget foot. Does foot hurt much morning?” “More I enjoy,” answer. “Then perhaps could forget it,” said little fellow anxiously. “Perhaps would bother told game. Do think would amuse you, think would bother you?” “Go get it,” said Earl. It certainly novel entertainment this,--making companion child offered teach play games,--but novelty amused him. There smile lurking Earl's mouth Cedric came back box containing game, arms, expression eager interest face. “May I pull little table chair?” asked. “Ring Thomas,” said Earl. “He place you.” “Oh, I myself,” answered Fauntleroy. “It heavy.” “Very well,” replied grandfather. The lurking smile deepened old man's face watched little fellow's preparations; absorbed interest them. The small table dragged forward placed chair, game taken box arranged upon it. “It interesting begin,” said Fauntleroy. “You see, black pegs side white ones mine. They men, know, round field home run counts one--and outs--and first base second third home base.” He entered details explanation greatest animation. He showed attitudes pitcher catcher batter real game, gave dramatic description wonderful “hot ball” seen caught glorious occasion witnessed match company Mr. Hobbs. His vigorous, graceful little body, eager gestures, simple enjoyment all, pleasant behold. When last explanations illustrations end game began good earnest, Earl still found entertained. His young companion wholly absorbed; played childish heart; gay little laughs made good throw, enthusiasm “home run,” impartial delight good luck opponent's, would given flavor game. If, week before, one told Earl Dorincourt particular morning would forgetting gout bad temper child's game, played black white wooden pegs, gayly painted board, curly-headed small boy companion, would without doubt made unpleasant; yet certainly forgotten door opened Thomas announced visitor. The visitor question, elderly gentleman black, less person clergyman parish, startled amazing scene met eye, almost fell back pace, ran risk colliding Thomas. There was, fact, part duty Reverend Mr. Mordaunt found decidedly unpleasant part compelled call upon noble patron Castle. His noble patron, indeed, usually made visits disagreeable lay lordly power make them. He abhorred churches charities, flew violent rages tenantry took liberty poor ill needing assistance. When gout worst, hesitate announce would bored irritated told stories miserable misfortunes; gout troubled less somewhat humane frame mind, would perhaps give rector money, bullied painful manner, berated whole parish shiftlessness imbecility. But, whatsoever mood, never failed make many sarcastic embarrassing speeches possible, Reverend Mr. Mordaunt wish proper Christian-like throw something heavy him. During years Mr. Mordaunt charge Dorincourt parish, rector certainly remember seen lordship, free will, one kindness, or, circumstances whatever, show thought one himself. He called to-day speak specially pressing case, walked avenue, had, two reasons, dreaded visit usual. In first place, knew lordship several days suffering gout, villainous humor rumors even reached village--carried one young women servants, sister, kept little shop retailed darning-needles cotton peppermints gossip, means earning honest living. What Mrs. Dibble know Castle inmates, farm-houses inmates, village population, really worth talked about. And course knew everything Castle, sister, Jane Shorts, one upper housemaids, friendly intimate Thomas. “And way lordship go on!” said Mrs. Dibble, counter, “and way use language, Mr. Thomas told Jane herself, flesh blood livery could stand--for throw plate toast Mr. Thomas, hisself, did, two days since, things agreeable society stairs genteel, warning would gave within a' hour!” And rector heard this, somehow Earl favorite black sheep cottages farm-houses, bad behavior gave many good woman something talk company tea. And second reason even worse, new one talked excited interest. Who know old nobleman's fury handsome son Captain married American lady? Who know cruelly treated Captain, big, gay, sweet-smiling young man, member grand family one liked, died foreign land, poor unforgiven? Who know fiercely lordship hated poor young creature son's wife, hated thought child never meant see boy--until two sons died left without heir? And then, know looked forward without affection pleasure grandson's coming, made mind find boy vulgar, awkward, pert American lad, likely disgrace noble name honor it? The proud, angry old man thought kept thoughts secret. He suppose one dared guess at, much less talk felt, dreaded; servants watched him, read face ill-humors fits gloom, discussed servants' hall. And thought quite secure common herd, Thomas telling Jane cook, butler, housemaids footmen opinion “the hold man wuss usual a-thinkin' hover Capting's boy, an' hanticipatin' credit fambly. An' serve right,” added Thomas; “hit's 'is hown fault. Wot iggspect child brought pore circumstances low Hamerica?” And Reverend Mr. Mordaunt walked great trees, remembered questionable little boy arrived Castle evening before, nine chances one lordship's worst fears realized, twenty-two chances one poor little fellow disappointed him, Earl even tearing rage, ready vent rancor first person called--which appeared probable would reverend self. Judge amazement when, Thomas opened library door, ears greeted delighted ring childish laughter. “That two out!” shouted excited, clear little voice. “You see two out!” And Earl's chair, gout-stool, foot it; small table game it; quite close him, actually leaning arm ungouty knee, little boy face glowing, eyes dancing excitement. “It two out!” little stranger cried. “You luck time, you?”--And recognized one come in. The Earl glanced around, knitting shaggy eyebrows trick doing, saw was, Mr. Mordaunt still surprised see looked even less disagreeable usual instead so. In fact, looked almost forgotten moment disagreeable was, unpleasant really could make tried. “Ah!” said, harsh voice, giving hand rather graciously. “Good-morning, Mordaunt. I found new employment, see.” He put hand Cedric's shoulder,--perhaps deep heart stir gratified pride heir present; spark something like pleasure eyes moved boy slightly forward. “This new Lord Fauntleroy,” said. “Fauntleroy, Mr. Mordaunt, rector parish.” Fauntleroy looked gentleman clerical garments, gave hand. “I glad make acquaintance, sir,” said, remembering words heard Mr. Hobbs use one two occasions greeting new customer ceremony. Cedric felt quite sure one ought usually polite minister. Mr. Mordaunt held small hand moment looked child's face, smiling involuntarily. He liked little fellow instant--as fact people always like him. And boy's beauty grace appealed him; simple, natural kindliness little lad made words uttered, however quaint unexpected, sound pleasant sincere. As rector looked Cedric, forgot think Earl all. Nothing world strong kind heart, somehow kind little heart, though heart child, seemed clear atmosphere big gloomy room make brighter. “I delighted make acquaintance, Lord Fauntleroy,” said rector. “You made long journey come us. A great many people glad know made safely.” “It WAS long way,” answered Fauntleroy, “but Dearest, mother, I lonely. Of course never lonely mother you; ship beautiful.” “Take chair, Mordaunt,” said Earl. Mr. Mordaunt sat down. He glanced Fauntleroy Earl. “Your lordship greatly congratulated,” said warmly. But Earl plainly intention showing feelings subject. “He like father,” said rather gruffly. “Let us hope conduct creditably.” And added: “Well, morning, Mordaunt? Who trouble now?” This bad Mr. Mordaunt expected, hesitated second began. “It Higgins,” said; “Higgins Edge Farm. He unfortunate. He ill last autumn, children scarlet fever. I cannot say good manager, ill-luck, course behindhand many ways. He trouble rent now. Newick tells pay it, must leave place; course would serious matter. His wife ill, came yesterday beg see it, ask time. He thinks would give time could catch again.” “They think that,” said Earl, looking rather black. Fauntleroy made movement forward. He standing grandfather visitor, listening might. He begun interested Higgins once. He wondered many children were, scarlet fever hurt much. His eyes wide open fixed upon Mr. Mordaunt intent interest gentleman went conversation. “Higgins well-meaning man,” said rector, making effort strengthen plea. “He bad enough tenant,” replied lordship. “And always behindhand, Newick tells me.” “He great trouble now,” said rector. “He fond wife children, farm taken may literally starve. He give nourishing things need. Two children left low fever, doctor orders wine luxuries Higgins afford.” At Fauntleroy moved step nearer. “That way Michael,” said. The Earl slightly started. “I forgot YOU!” said. “I forgot philanthropist room. Who Michael?” And gleam queer amusement came back old man's deep-set eyes. “He Bridget's husband, fever,” answered Fauntleroy; “and could pay rent buy wine things. And gave money help him.” The Earl drew brows together curious frown, somehow scarcely grim all. He glanced across Mr. Mordaunt. “I know sort landed proprietor make,” said. “I told Havisham boy wanted--anything wanted--and wanted, seems, money give beggars.” “Oh! beggars,” said Fauntleroy eagerly. “Michael splendid bricklayer! They worked.” “Oh!” said Earl, “they beggars. They splendid bricklayers, bootblacks, apple-women.” He bent gaze boy seconds silence. The fact new thought coming him, though, perhaps, prompted noblest emotions, bad thought. “Come here,” said, last. Fauntleroy went stood near possible without encroaching gouty foot. “What would YOU case?” lordship asked. It must confessed Mr. Mordaunt experienced moment curious sensation. Being man great thoughtfulness, spent many years estate Dorincourt, knowing tenantry, rich poor, people village, honest industrious, dishonest lazy, realized strongly power good evil would given future one small boy standing there, brown eyes wide open, hands deep pockets; thought came also great deal power might, perhaps, caprice proud, self-indulgent old man, given now, young nature simple generous one, might worst thing could happen, others, himself. “And would YOU case?” demanded Earl. Fauntleroy drew little nearer, laid one hand knee, confiding air good comradeship. “If I rich,” said, “and little boy, I let stay, give things children; then, I boy.” Then, second's pause, face brightened visibly, “YOU anything, cannot you?” said. “Humph!” said lord, staring him. “That opinion, it?” And displeased either. “I mean give one anything,” said Fauntleroy. “Who Newick?” “He agent,” answered Earl, “and tenants over-fond him.” “Are going write letter now?” inquired Fauntleroy. “Shall I bring pen ink? I take game table.” It plainly instant occurred Newick would allowed worst. The Earl paused moment, still looking him. “Can write?” asked. “Yes,” answered Cedric, “but well.” “Move things table,” commanded lord, “and bring pen ink, sheet paper desk.” Mr. Mordaunt's interest began increase. Fauntleroy told deftly. In moments, sheet paper, big inkstand, pen ready. “There!” said gayly, “now write it.” “You write it,” said Earl. “I!” exclaimed Fauntleroy, flush overspread forehead. “Will I write it? I always spell quite right I dictionary, nobody tells me.” “It do,” answered Earl. “Higgins complain spelling. I philanthropist; are. Dip pen ink.” Fauntleroy took pen dipped ink-bottle, arranged position, leaning table. “Now,” inquired, “what must I say?” “You may say, 'Higgins interfered with, present,' sign it, 'Fauntleroy,'” said Earl. Fauntleroy dipped pen ink again, resting arm, began write. It rather slow serious process, gave whole soul it. After while, however, manuscript complete, handed grandfather smile slightly tinged anxiety. “Do think do?” asked. The Earl looked it, corners mouth twitched little. “Yes,” answered; “Higgins find entirely satisfactory.” And handed Mr. Mordaunt. What Mr. Mordaunt found written this: “Dear mr. Newik pleas mr. higins intur feared present oblige. Yours rispecferly, “FAUNTLEROY.” “Mr. Hobbs always signed letters way,” said Fauntleroy; “and I thought I would better say 'please.' Is exactly right way spell 'interfered'?” “It exactly way spelled dictionary,” answered Earl. “I afraid that,” said Fauntleroy. “I ought asked. You see, way words one syllable; look dictionary. It always safest. I write again.” And write did, making quite imposing copy, taking precautions matter spelling consulting Earl himself. “Spelling curious thing,” said. “It often different expect be. I used think 'please' spelled p-l-e-e-s, not, know; would think 'dear' spelled d-e-r-e, inquire. Sometimes almost discourages you.” When Mr. Mordaunt went away, took letter him, took something else also--namely, pleasanter feeling hopeful one ever carried home avenue previous visit made Dorincourt Castle. When gone, Fauntleroy, accompanied door, went back grandfather. “May I go Dearest now?” asked. “I think waiting me.” The Earl silent moment. “There something stable see first,” said. “Ring bell.” “If please,” said Fauntleroy, quick little flush. “I much obliged; I think I would better see to-morrow. She expecting time.” “Very well,” answered Earl. “We order carriage.” Then added dryly, “It pony.” Fauntleroy drew long breath. “A pony!” exclaimed. “Whose pony it?” “Yours,” replied Earl. “Mine?” cried little fellow. “Mine--like things upstairs?” “Yes,” said grandfather. “Would like see it? Shall I order brought around?” Fauntleroy's cheeks grew redder redder. “I never thought I pony!” said. “I never thought that! How glad Dearest be. You give EVERYthing, you?” “Do wish see it?” inquired Earl. Fauntleroy drew long breath. “I WANT see it,” said. “I want see much I hardly wait. But I afraid time.” “You MUST go see mother afternoon?” asked Earl. “You think cannot put off?” “Why,” said Fauntleroy, “she thinking morning, I thinking her!” “Oh!” said Earl. “You have, you? Ring bell.” As drove avenue, arching trees, rather silent. But Fauntleroy not. He talked pony. What color it? How big it? What name? What like eat best? How old it? How early morning might get see it? “Dearest glad!” kept saying. “She much obliged kind me! She knows I always liked ponies much, never thought I one. There little boy Fifth Avenue one, used ride every morning used take walk past house see him.” He leaned back cushions regarded Earl rapt interest minutes entire silence. “I think must best person world,” burst forth last. “You always good, you?--and thinking people. Dearest says best kind goodness; think yourself, think people. That way are, it?” His lordship dumfounded find presented agreeable colors, know exactly say. He felt needed time reflection. To see ugly, selfish motives changed good generous one simplicity child singular experience. Fauntleroy went on, still regarding admiring eyes--those great, clear, innocent eyes! “You make many people happy,” said. “There Michael Bridget ten children, apple-woman, Dick, Mr. Hobbs, Mr. Higgins Mrs. Higgins children, Mr. Mordaunt,--because course glad,--and Dearest me, pony things. Do know, I counted fingers mind, twenty-seven people kind to. That good many--twenty-seven!” “And I person kind them--was I?” said Earl. “Why, yes, know,” answered Fauntleroy. “You made happy. Do know,” delicate hesitation, “that people sometimes mistaken earls know them. Mr. Hobbs was. I going write him, tell it.” “What Mr. Hobbs's opinion earls?” asked lordship. “Well, see, difficulty was,” replied young companion, “that know any, would read books. He thought--you must mind it--that gory tyrants; said would hanging around store. But would known YOU, I sure would felt quite different. I shall tell you.” “What shall tell him?” “I shall tell him,” said Fauntleroy, glowing enthusiasm, “that kindest man I ever heard of. And always thinking people, making happy and--and I hope I grow up, I shall like you.” “Just like me!” repeated lordship, looking little kindling face. And dull red crept withered skin, suddenly turned eyes away looked carriage window great beech-trees, sun shining glossy, red-brown leaves. “JUST like you,” said Fauntleroy, adding modestly, “if I can. Perhaps I good enough, I going try.” The carriage rolled stately avenue beautiful, broad-branched trees, spaces green shade lanes golden sunlight. Fauntleroy saw lovely places ferns grew high bluebells swayed breeze; saw deer, standing lying deep grass, turn large, startled eyes carriage passed, caught glimpses brown rabbits scurried away. He heard whir partridges calls songs birds, seemed even beautiful before. All heart filled pleasure happiness beauty every side. But old Earl saw heard different things, though apparently looking too. He saw long life, neither generous deeds kind thoughts; saw years man young strong rich powerful used youth strength wealth power please kill time days years succeeded other; saw man, time killed old age come, solitary without real friends midst splendid wealth; saw people disliked feared him, people would flatter cringe him, one really cared whether lived died, unless something gain lose it. He looked broad acres belonged him, knew Fauntleroy not--how far extended, wealth represented, many people homes soil. And knew, too,--another thing Fauntleroy not,--that homes, humble well-to-do, probably one person, however much envied wealth stately name power, however willing would possess them, would instant thought calling noble owner “good,” wishing, simple-souled little boy had, like him. And exactly pleasant reflect upon, even cynical, worldly old man, sufficient unto seventy years never deigned care opinion world held long interfere comfort entertainment. And fact was, indeed, never condescended reflect upon all; child believed better was, wishing follow illustrious footsteps imitate example, suggested curious question whether exactly person take model. Fauntleroy thought Earl's foot must hurting him, brows knitted together so, looked park; thinking this, considerate little fellow tried disturb him, enjoyed trees ferns deer silence. But last carriage, passed gates bowled green lanes short distance, stopped. They reached Court Lodge; Fauntleroy upon ground almost big footman time open carriage door. The Earl wakened reverie start. “What!” said. “Are here?” “Yes,” said Fauntleroy. “Let give stick. Just lean get out.” “I going get out,” replied lordship brusquely. “Not--not see Dearest?” exclaimed Fauntleroy astonished face. “'Dearest' excuse me,” said Earl dryly. “Go tell even new pony would keep away.” “She disappointed,” said Fauntleroy. “She want see much.” “I afraid not,” answer. “The carriage call come back.--Tell Jeffries drive on, Thomas.” Thomas closed carriage door; and, puzzled look, Fauntleroy ran drive. The Earl opportunity--as Mr. Havisham had--of seeing pair handsome, strong little legs flash ground astonishing rapidity. Evidently owner intention losing time. The carriage rolled slowly away, lordship lean back; still looked out. Through space trees could see house door; wide open. The little figure dashed steps; another figure--a little figure, too, slender young, black gown--ran meet it. It seemed flew together, Fauntleroy leaped mother's arms, hanging neck covering sweet young face kisses. VII On following Sunday morning, Mr. Mordaunt large congregation. Indeed, could scarcely remember Sunday church crowded. People appeared upon scene seldom honor coming hear sermons. There even people Hazelton, next parish. There hearty, sunburned farmers, stout, comfortable, apple-cheeked wives best bonnets gorgeous shawls, half dozen children family. The doctor's wife there, four daughters. Mrs. Kimsey Mr. Kimsey, kept druggist's shop, made pills, powders everybody within ten miles, sat pew; Mrs. Dibble hers; Miss Smiff, village dressmaker, friend Miss Perkins, milliner, sat theirs; doctor's young man present, druggist's apprentice; fact, almost every family county side represented, one way another. In course preceding week, many wonderful stories told little Lord Fauntleroy. Mrs. Dibble kept busy attending customers came buy pennyworth needles ha'porth tape hear relate, little shop bell door nearly tinkled death coming going. Mrs. Dibble knew exactly small lordship's rooms furnished him, expensive toys bought, beautiful brown pony awaiting him, small groom attend it, little dog-cart, silver-mounted harness. And could tell, too, servants said caught glimpses child night arrival; every female stairs said shame, was, part poor pretty dear mother; declared hearts came mouths went alone library see grandfather, “there knowing would treated, lordship's temper enough fluster old heads shoulders, let alone child.” “But believe me, Mrs. Jennifer, mum,” Mrs. Dibble said, “fear child know--so Mr. Thomas hisself says; an' set an' smile did, an' talked lordship would friends ever since first hour. An' Earl took aback, Mr. Thomas says, could nothing listen stare eyebrows. An' Mr. Thomas's opinion, Mrs. Bates, mum, bad is, pleased secret soul, an' proud, too; handsomer little fellow, better manners, though old-fashioned, Mr. Thomas says would never wish see.” And come story Higgins. The Reverend Mr. Mordaunt told dinner table, servants heard told kitchen, spread like wildfire. And market-day, Higgins appeared town, questioned every side, Newick questioned too, response shown two three people note signed “Fauntleroy.” And farmers' wives found plenty talk tea shopping, done subject full justice made it. And Sunday either walked church driven gigs husbands, perhaps trifle curious new little lord time owner soil. It means Earl's habit attend church, chose appear first Sunday--it whim present huge family pew, Fauntleroy side. There many loiterers churchyard, many lingerers lane morning. There groups gates porch, much discussion whether lord would really appear not. When discussion height, one good woman suddenly uttered exclamation. “Eh,” said, “that must mother, pretty young thing.” All heard turned looked slender figure black coming path. The veil thrown back face could see fair sweet was, bright hair curled softly child's little widow's cap. She thinking people about; thinking Cedric, visits her, joy new pony, actually ridden door day before, sitting straight looking proud happy. But soon could help attracted fact looked arrival created sort sensation. She first noticed old woman red cloak made bobbing courtesy her, another thing said, “God bless you, lady!” one man another took hat passed. For moment understand, realized little Lord Fauntleroy's mother so, flushed rather shyly smiled bowed too, said, “Thank you,” gentle voice old woman blessed her. To person always lived bustling, crowded American city simple deference novel, first little embarrassing; all, could help liking touched friendly warm-heartedness seemed speak. She scarcely passed stone porch church great event day happened. The carriage Castle, handsome horses tall liveried servants, bowled around corner green lane. “Here come!” went one looker-on another. And carriage drew up, Thomas stepped opened door, little boy, dressed black velvet, splendid mop bright waving hair, jumped out. Every man, woman, child looked curiously upon him. “He Captain again!” said on-lookers remembered father. “He Captain's self, life!” He stood sunlight looking Earl, Thomas helped nobleman out, affectionate interest could imagined. The instant could help, put hand offered shoulder seven feet high. It plain enough every one however might people, Earl Dorincourt struck terror breast grandson. “Just lean me,” heard say. “How glad people see you, well seem know you!” “Take cap, Fauntleroy,” said Earl. “They bowing you.” “To me!” cried Fauntleroy, whipping cap moment, baring bright head crowd turning shining, puzzled eyes tried bow every one once. “God bless lordship!” said courtesying, red-cloaked old woman spoken mother; “long life you!” “Thank you, madam,” said Fauntleroy. And went church, looked there, way aisle square, red-cushioned curtained pew. When Fauntleroy fairly seated, made two discoveries pleased him: first that, across church could look her, mother sat smiled him; second, one end pew, wall, knelt two quaint figures carven stone, facing kneeled either side pillar supporting two stone missals, pointed hands folded prayer, dress antique strange. On tablet written something could read curious words: “Here lyeth ye bodye Gregorye Arthure Fyrst Earle Dorincourt Allsoe Alisone Hildegarde hys wyfe.” “May I whisper?” inquired lordship, devoured curiosity. “What it?” said grandfather. “Who they?” “Some ancestors,” answered Earl, “who lived hundred years ago.” “Perhaps,” said Lord Fauntleroy, regarding respect, “perhaps I got spelling them.” And proceeded find place church service. When music began, stood looked across mother, smiling. He fond music, mother often sang together, joined rest, pure, sweet, high voice rising clear song bird. He quite forgot pleasure it. The Earl forgot little too, sat curtain-shielded corner pew watched boy. Cedric stood big psalter open hands, singing childish might, face little uplifted, happily; sang, long ray sunshine crept and, slanting golden pane stained glass window, brightened falling hair young head. His mother, looked across church, felt thrill pass heart, prayer rose too,--a prayer pure, simple happiness childish soul might last, strange, great fortune fallen might bring wrong evil it. There many soft, anxious thoughts tender heart new days. “Oh, Ceddie!” said evening before, hung saying good-night, went away; “oh, Ceddie, dear, I wish sake I clever could say great many wise things! But good, dear, brave, kind true always, never hurt one, long live, may help many, big world may better little child born. And best all, Ceddie,--it better everything else, world little better man lived--even ever little better, dearest.” And return Castle, Fauntleroy repeated words grandfather. “And I thought said that,” ended; “and I told way world lived, I going try I could like you.” “And say that?” asked lordship, trifle uneasily. “She said right, must always look good people try like it.” Perhaps old man remembered glanced divided folds red curtain pew. Many times looked people's heads son's wife sat alone, saw fair face unforgiven dead loved, eyes like child side; thoughts were, whether hard bitter, softened little, would hard discover. As came church, many attended service stood waiting see pass. As neared gate, man stood hat hand made step forward hesitated. He middle-aged farmer, careworn face. “Well, Higgins,” said Earl. Fauntleroy turned quickly look him. “Oh!” exclaimed, “is Mr. Higgins?” “Yes,” answered Earl dryly; “and I suppose came take look new landlord.” “Yes, lord,” said man, sunburned face reddening. “Mr. Newick told young lordship kind enough speak me, I thought I would like say word thanks, I might allowed.” Perhaps felt wonder saw little fellow innocently done much him, stood looking one less fortunate children might done--apparently realizing importance least. “I great deal thank lordship for,” said; “a great deal. I----” “Oh,” said Fauntleroy; “I wrote letter. It grandfather it. But know always good everybody. Is Mrs. Higgins well now?” Higgins looked trifle taken aback. He also somewhat startled hearing noble landlord presented character benevolent being, full engaging qualities. “I--well, yes, lordship,” stammered, “the missus better since trouble took mind. It worrying broke down.” “I glad that,” said Fauntleroy. “My grandfather sorry children scarlet fever, I. He children himself. I son's little boy, know.” Higgins verge panic-stricken. He felt would safer discreet plan look Earl, well known fatherly affection sons seen twice year, ill, promptly departed London, would bored doctors nurses. It little trying, therefore, lordship's nerves told, looked on, eyes gleaming shaggy eyebrows, felt interest scarlet fever. “You see, Higgins,” broke Earl fine grim smile, “you people mistaken me. Lord Fauntleroy understands me. When want reliable information subject character, apply him. Get carriage, Fauntleroy.” And Fauntleroy jumped in, carriage rolled away green lane, even turned corner high road, Earl still grimly smiling. VIII Lord Dorincourt occasion wear grim smile many time days passed by. Indeed, acquaintance grandson progressed, wore smile often moments almost lost grimness. There denying Lord Fauntleroy appeared scene, old man growing tired loneliness gout seventy years. After long life excitement amusement, agreeable sit alone even splendid room, one foot gout-stool, diversion flying rage, shouting frightened footman hated sight him. The old Earl clever man know perfectly well servants detested him, even visitors, come love him--though found sort amusement sharp, sarcastic talk, spared one. So long strong well, gone one place another, pretending amuse himself, though really enjoyed it; health began fail, felt tired everything shut Dorincourt, gout newspapers books. But could read time, became “bored,” called it. He hated long nights days, grew savage irritable. And Fauntleroy came; Earl saw him, fortunately little fellow, secret pride grandfather gratified outset. If Cedric less handsome little fellow, old man might taken strong dislike would given chance see grandson's finer qualities. But chose think Cedric's beauty fearless spirit results Dorincourt blood credit Dorincourt rank. And heard lad talk, saw well-bred little fellow was, notwithstanding boyish ignorance new position meant, old Earl liked grandson more, actually began find rather entertained. It amused give childish hands power bestow benefit poor Higgins. My lord cared nothing poor Higgins, pleased little think grandson would talked country people would begin popular tenantry, even childhood. Then gratified drive church Cedric see excitement interest caused arrival. He knew people would speak beauty little lad; fine, strong, straight body; erect bearing, handsome face, bright hair, would say (as Earl heard one woman exclaim another) boy “every inch lord.” My lord Dorincourt arrogant old man, proud name, proud rank, therefore proud show world last House Dorincourt heir worthy position fill. The morning new pony tried, Earl pleased almost forgotten gout. When groom brought pretty creature, arched brown, glossy neck tossed fine head sun, Earl sat open window library looked Fauntleroy took first riding lesson. He wondered boy would show signs timidity. It small pony, often seen children lose courage making first essay riding. Fauntleroy mounted great delight. He never pony before, highest spirits. Wilkins, groom, led animal bridle library window. “He well plucked un, is,” Wilkins remarked stable afterward many grins. “It trouble put HIM up. An' old un would ha' sat straighter WERE up. He ses--ses me, 'Wilkins,' ses, I sitting straight? They sit straight circus,' ses he. An' I ses, 'As straight arrer, lordship!'--an' laughs, pleased could be, an' ses, 'That right,' ses, 'you tell I sit straight, Wilkins!'” But sitting straight led walk altogether completely satisfactory. After minutes, Fauntleroy spoke grandfather--watching window: “Cannot I go myself?” asked; “and cannot I go faster? The boy Fifth Avenue used trot canter!” “Do think could trot canter?” said Earl. “I like try,” answered Fauntleroy. His lordship made sign Wilkins, signal brought horse mounted took Fauntleroy's pony leading-rein. “Now,” said Earl, “let trot.” The next minutes rather exciting small equestrian. He found trotting easy walking, faster pony trotted, less easy was. “It j-jolts g-goo-good deal--do-does it?” said Wilkins. “D-does j-jolt y-you?” “No, lord,” answered Wilkins. “You get used time. Rise stirrups.” “I ri-rising t-time,” said Fauntleroy. He rising falling rather uncomfortably many shakes bounces. He breath face grew red, held might, sat straight could. The Earl could see window. When riders came back within speaking distance, hidden trees minutes, Fauntleroy's hat off, cheeks like poppies, lips set, still trotting manfully. “Stop minute!” said grandfather. “Where hat?” Wilkins touched his. “It fell off, lordship,” said, evident enjoyment. “Would let stop pick up, lord.” “Not much afraid, he?” asked Earl dryly. “Him, lordship!” exclaimed Wilkins. “I say knowed meant. I taught young gen'lemen ride afore, an' I never see one stick determinder.” “Tired?” said Earl Fauntleroy. “Want get off?” “It jolts think will,” admitted young lordship frankly. “And tires little, too; I want get off. I want learn how. As soon I got breath I want go back hat.” The cleverest person world, undertaken teach Fauntleroy please old man watched him, could taught anything would succeeded better. As pony trotted toward avenue, faint color crept fierce old face, eyes, shaggy brows, gleamed pleasure lordship scarcely expected know again. And sat watched quite eagerly sound horses' hoofs returned. When come, time, came faster pace. Fauntleroy's hat still off; Wilkins carrying him; cheeks redder before, hair flying ears, came quite brisk canter. “There!” panted, drew up, “I c-cantered. I well boy Fifth Avenue, I it, I staid on!” He Wilkins pony close friends that. Scarcely day passed country people see together, cantering gayly highroad green lanes. The children cottages would run door look proud little brown pony gallant little figure sitting straight saddle, young lord would snatch cap swing them, shout, “Hullo! Good-morning!” unlordly manner, though great heartiness. Sometimes would stop talk children, Wilkins came back castle story Fauntleroy insisted dismounting near village school, boy lame tired might ride home pony. “An' I blessed,” said Wilkins, telling story stables,--“I blessed would hear anything else! He would let get down, said boy might feel comfortable big horse. An' ses he, 'Wilkins,' ses he, 'that boy's lame I not, I want talk him, too.' And lad get, lord trudges alongside hands pockets, cap back head, a-whistling talking easy please! And come cottage, an' boy's mother come taking see up, whips cap an' ses he, 'I brought son home, madam,' ses he, 'because leg hurt him, I think stick enough lean on; I going ask grandfather pair crutches made him.' An' I blessed woman struck heap, well might be! I thought I 'a' hex-plodid, myself!” When Earl heard story angry, Wilkins half afraid would be; contrary, laughed outright, called Fauntleroy him, made tell matter beginning end, laughed again. And actually, days later, Dorincourt carriage stopped green lane cottage lame boy lived, Fauntleroy jumped walked door, carrying pair strong, light, new crutches shouldered like gun, presented Mrs. Hartle (the lame boy's name Hartle) words: “My grandfather's compliments, please, boy, hope get better.” “I said compliments,” explained Earl returned carriage. “You tell to, I thought perhaps forgot. That right, it?” And Earl laughed again, say not. In fact, two becoming intimate every day, every day Fauntleroy's faith lordship's benevolence virtue increased. He doubt whatever grandfather amiable generous elderly gentlemen. Certainly, found wishes gratified almost uttered; gifts pleasures lavished upon him, sometimes almost bewildered possessions. Apparently, everything wanted, everything wished do. And though would certainly wise plan pursue small boys, young lordship bore amazingly well. Perhaps, notwithstanding sweet nature, might somewhat spoiled it, hours spent mother Court Lodge. That “best friend” watched ever closely tenderly. The two many long talks together, never went back Castle kisses cheeks without carrying heart simple, pure words worth remembering. There one thing, true, puzzled little fellow much. He thought mystery much oftener one supposed; even mother know often pondered it; Earl long time never suspected all. But, quick observe, little boy could help wondering mother grandfather never seemed meet. He noticed never meet. When Dorincourt carriage stopped Court Lodge, Earl never alighted, rare occasions lordship's going church, Fauntleroy always left speak mother porch alone, perhaps go home her. And yet, every day, fruit flowers sent Court Lodge hot-houses Castle. But one virtuous action Earl's set upon pinnacle perfection Cedric's eyes, done soon first Sunday Mrs. Errol walked home church unattended. About week later, Cedric going one day visit mother, found door, instead large carriage prancing pair, pretty little brougham handsome bay horse. “That present mother,” Earl said abruptly. “She go walking country. She needs carriage. The man drives take charge it. It present YOU.” Fauntleroy's delight could feebly express itself. He could scarcely contain reached lodge. His mother gathering roses garden. He flung little brougham flew her. “Dearest!” cried, “could believe it? This yours! He says present me. It carriage drive everywhere in!” He happy know say. She could borne spoil pleasure refusing accept gift even though came man chose consider enemy. She obliged step carriage, roses all, let taken drive, Fauntleroy told stories grandfather's goodness amiability. They innocent stories sometimes could help laughing little, would draw little boy closer side kiss him, feeling glad could see good old man, friends. The next day that, Fauntleroy wrote Mr. Hobbs. He wrote quite long letter, first copy written, brought grandfather inspected. “Because,” said, “it uncertain spelling. And tell mistakes, I write again.” This written: “My dear mr hobbs want tell granfarther best earl ever new mistake earls tirents tirent wish new would good friends sure would gout foot grate sufrer pashent love every day becaus one could help loving earl like kind every one world wish could talk knows everything world ask question never plaid base ball given pony cart mamma bewtifle cariage I three rooms toys kinds would serprise would like castle park large castle could lose wilkins tells wilkins groom says dungon castle pretty everything park would serprise big trees deers rabbits games flying cover granfarther rich proud orty thought earls always like people polite kind take hats women make curtsies sometimes say god bless ride first shook troted granfarther let poor man stay farm could pay rent mrs mellon went take wine things sick children like see wish dearest could live castle happy miss much love granfarther every one plees write soon “your afechshnet old frend “Cedric Errol “p one dungon granfarfher never one langwishin there. “p good earl reminds unerversle favrit” “Do miss mother much?” asked Earl finished reading this. “Yes,” said Fauntleroy, “I miss time.” He went stood Earl put hand knee, looking him. “YOU miss her, you?” said. “I know her,” answered lordship rather crustily. “I know that,” said Fauntleroy, “and makes wonder. She told ask questions, and--and I not, sometimes I cannot help thinking, know, makes puzzled. But I going ask questions. And I miss much, I go look window I see light shine every night open place trees. It long way off, puts window soon dark, I see twinkle far away, I know says.” “What say?” asked lord. “It says, 'Good-night, God keep night!'--just used say together. Every night used say me, every morning said, 'God bless day!' So see I quite safe time----” “Quite, I doubt,” said lordship dryly. And drew beetling eyebrows looked little boy fixedly long Fauntleroy wondered could thinking of. IX The fact was, lordship Earl Dorincourt thought days, many things never thought before, thoughts one way another connected grandson. His pride strongest part nature, boy gratified every point. Through pride began find new interest life. He began take pleasure showing heir world. The world known disappointment sons; agreeable touch triumph exhibiting new Lord Fauntleroy, could disappoint one. He wished child appreciate power understand splendor position; wished others realize too. He made plans future. Sometimes secret actually found wishing past life better one, less pure, childish heart would shrink knew truth. It agreeable think beautiful, innocent face would look owner made chance understand grandfather called many year “the wicked Earl Dorincourt.” The thought even made feel trifle nervous. He wish boy find out. Sometimes new interest forgot gout, doctor surprised find noble patient's health growing better expected ever would again. Perhaps Earl grew better time pass slowly him, something think beside pains infirmities. One fine morning, people amazed see little Lord Fauntleroy riding pony another companion Wilkins. This new companion rode tall, powerful gray horse, Earl himself. It was, fact, Fauntleroy suggested plan. As point mounting pony, said rather wistfully grandfather: “I wish going me. When I go away I feel lonely left big castle. I wish could ride too.” And greatest excitement aroused stables minutes later arrival order Selim saddled Earl. After that, Selim saddled almost every day; people became accustomed sight tall gray horse carrying tall gray old man, handsome, fierce, eagle face, side brown pony bore little Lord Fauntleroy. And rides together green lanes pretty country roads, two riders became intimate ever. And gradually old man heard great deal “Dearest” life. As Fauntleroy trotted big horse chatted gayly. There could well brighter little comrade, nature happy. It talked most. The Earl often silent, listening watching joyous, glowing face. Sometimes would tell young companion set pony gallop, little fellow dashed off, sitting straight fearless, would watch gleam pride pleasure eyes; when, dash, Fauntleroy came back waving cap laughing shout, always felt grandfather good friends indeed. One thing Earl discovered son's wife lead idle life. It long learned poor people knew well indeed. When sickness sorrow poverty house, little brougham often stood door. “Do know,” said Fauntleroy once, “they say, 'God bless you!' see her, children glad. There go house taught sew. She says feels rich wants help poor ones.” It displeased Earl find mother heir beautiful young face looked much like lady duchess; one way displease know popular beloved poor. And yet often conscious hard, jealous pang saw filled child's heart boy clung best beloved. The old man would desired stand first rival. That morning drew horse elevated point moor rode, made gesture whip, broad, beautiful landscape spread them. “Do know land belongs me?” said Fauntleroy. “Does it?” answered Fauntleroy. “How much belong one person, beautiful!” “Do know day belong you--that great deal more?” “To me!” exclaimed Fauntleroy rather awe-stricken voice. “When?” “When I dead,” grandfather answered. “Then I want it,” said Fauntleroy; “I want live always.” “That kind,” answered Earl dry way; “nevertheless, day yours--some day Earl Dorincourt.” Little Lord Fauntleroy sat still saddle moments. He looked broad moors, green farms, beautiful copses, cottages lanes, pretty village, trees turrets great castle rose, gray stately. Then gave queer little sigh. “What thinking of?” asked Earl. “I thinking,” replied Fauntleroy, “what little boy I am! Dearest said me.” “What it?” inquired Earl. “She said perhaps easy rich; one many things always, one might sometimes forget every one else fortunate, one rich always careful try remember. I talking good were, said good thing, earl much power, cared pleasure never thought people lived lands, might trouble could help--and many people, would hard thing. And I looking houses, thinking I find people, I earl. How find them?” As lordship's knowledge tenantry consisted finding paid rent promptly, turning not, rather hard question. “Newick finds me,” said, pulled great gray mustache, looked small questioner rather uneasily. “We go home now,” added; “and earl, see better earl I been!” He silent rode home. He felt almost incredible never really loved one life, find growing fond little fellow,--as without doubt was. At first pleased proud Cedric's beauty bravery, something pride feeling now. He laughed grim, dry laugh sometimes, thought liked boy near him, liked hear voice, secret really wished liked thought well small grandson. “I old fellow dotage, I nothing else think of,” would say himself; yet knew altogether. And allowed admit truth, would perhaps found obliged things attracted him, spite himself, qualities never possessed--the frank, true, kindly nature, affectionate trustfulness could never think evil. It week ride when, visit mother, Fauntleroy came library troubled, thoughtful face. He sat high-backed chair sat evening arrival, looked embers hearth. The Earl watched silence, wondering coming. It evident Cedric something mind. At last looked up. “Does Newick know people?” asked. “It business know them,” said lordship. “Been neglecting it--has he?” Contradictory may seem, nothing entertained edified little fellow's interest tenantry. He never taken interest himself, pleased well enough that, childish habits thought midst childish amusements high spirits, quaint seriousness working curly head. “There place,” said Fauntleroy, looking wide-open, horror-stricken eye--“Dearest seen it; end village. The houses close together, almost falling down; scarcely breathe; people poor, everything dreadful! Often fever, children die; makes wicked live like that, poor miserable! It worse Michael Bridget! The rain comes roof! Dearest went see poor woman lived there. She would let come near changed things. The tears ran cheeks told it!” The tears come eyes, smiled them. “I told know, I would tell you,” said. He jumped came leaned Earl's chair. “You make right,” said, “just made right Higgins. You always make right everybody. I told would, Newick must forgotten tell you.” The Earl looked hand knee. Newick forgotten tell him; fact, Newick spoken desperate condition end village known Earl's Court. He knew tumble-down, miserable cottages, bad drainage, damp walls broken windows leaking roofs, poverty, fever, misery. Mr. Mordaunt painted strongest words could use, lordship used violent language response; and, gout worst, said sooner people Earl's Court died buried parish better would be,--and end matter. And yet, looked small hand knee, small hand honest, earnest, frank-eyed face, actually little ashamed Earl's Court himself. “What!” said; “you want make builder model cottages me, you?” And positively put hand upon childish one stroked it. “Those must pulled down,” said Fauntleroy, great eagerness. “Dearest says so. Let us--let us go pulled to-morrow. The people glad see you! They know come help them!” And eyes shone like stars glowing face. The Earl rose chair put hand child's shoulder. “Let us go take walk terrace,” said, short laugh; “and talk over.” And though laughed two three times again, walked fro broad stone terrace, walked together almost every fine evening, seemed thinking something displease him, still kept hand small companion's shoulder. X The truth Mrs. Errol found great many sad things course work among poor little village appeared picturesque seen moor-sides. Everything picturesque, seen near by, looked distance. She found idleness poverty ignorance comfort industry. And discovered, while, Erleboro considered worst village part country. Mr. Mordaunt told great many difficulties discouragements, found great deal herself. The agents managed property always chosen please Earl, cared nothing degradation wretchedness poor tenants. Many things, therefore, neglected attended to, matters gone bad worse. As Earl's Court, disgrace, dilapidated houses miserable, careless, sickly people. When first Mrs. Errol went place, made shudder. Such ugliness slovenliness want seemed worse country place city. It seemed might helped. And looked squalid, uncared-for children growing midst vice brutal indifference, thought little boy spending days great, splendid castle, guarded served like young prince, wish ungratified, knowing nothing luxury ease beauty. And bold thought came wise little mother-heart. Gradually begun see, others, boy's good fortune please Earl much, would scarcely likely denied anything expressed desire. “The Earl would give anything,” said Mr. Mordaunt. “He would indulge every whim. Why indulgence used good others? It see shall come pass.” She knew could trust kind, childish heart; told little fellow story Earl's Court, feeling sure would speak grandfather, hoping good results would follow. And strange appeared every one, good results follow. The fact strongest power influence Earl grandson's perfect confidence him--the fact Cedric always believed grandfather going right generous. He could quite make mind let discover inclination generous all, wanted way occasions, whether right wrong. It novelty regarded admiration benefactor entire human race, soul nobility, enjoy idea looking affectionate brown eyes, saying: “I violent, selfish old rascal; I never generous thing life, I care Earl's Court poor people”--or something would amount thing. He actually learned fond enough small boy mop yellow love-locks, feel would prefer guilty amiable action then. And so--though laughed himself--after reflection, sent Newick, quite long interview subject Court, decided wretched hovels pulled new houses built. “It Lord Fauntleroy insists it,” said dryly; “he thinks improve property. You tell tenants idea.” And looked small lordship, lying hearth-rug playing Dougal. The great dog lad's constant companion, followed everywhere, stalking solemnly walked, trotting majestically behind rode drove. Of course, country people town people heard proposed improvement. At first, many would believe it; small army workmen arrived commenced pulling crazy, squalid cottages, people began understand little Lord Fauntleroy done good turn again, innocent interference scandal Earl's Court last removed. If known talked praised everywhere, prophesied great things grew up, astonished would been! But never suspected it. He lived simple, happy, child life,--frolicking park; chasing rabbits burrows; lying trees grass, rug library, reading wonderful books talking Earl them, telling stories mother; writing long letters Dick Mr. Hobbs, responded characteristic fashion; riding grandfather's side, Wilkins escort. As rode market town, used see people turn look, noticed lifted hats faces often brightened much; thought grandfather him. “They fond you,” said, looking lordship bright smile. “Do see glad see you? I hope day fond me. It must nice EVERYbody like you.” And felt quite proud grandson greatly admired beloved individual. When cottages built, lad grandfather used ride Earl's Court together look them, Fauntleroy full interest. He would dismount pony go make acquaintance workmen, asking questions building bricklaying, telling things America. After two three conversations, able enlighten Earl subject brick-making, rode home. “I always like know things like those,” said, “because never know coming to.” When left them, workmen used talk among themselves, laugh odd, innocent speeches; liked him, liked see stand among them, talking away, hands pockets, hat pushed back curls, small face full eagerness. “He rare un,” used say. “An' noice little outspoken chap, too. Not much th' bad stock him.” And would go home tell wives him, women would tell other, came almost every one talked of, knew story of, little Lord Fauntleroy; gradually almost every one knew “wicked Earl” found something cared last--something touched even warmed hard, bitter old heart. But one knew quite much warmed, day day old man found caring child, creature ever trusted him. He found looking forward time Cedric would young man, strong beautiful, life him, still kind heart power make friends everywhere, Earl wondered lad would do, would use gifts. Often watched little fellow lying upon hearth, conning big book, light shining bright young head, old eyes would gleam cheek would flush. “The boy anything,” would say himself, “anything!” He never spoke one else feeling Cedric; spoke others always grim smile. But Fauntleroy soon knew grandfather loved always liked near--near chair library, opposite table, side rode drove took evening walk broad terrace. “Do remember,” Cedric said once, looking book lay rug, “do remember I said first night good companions? I think people could better companions are, you?” “We pretty good companions, I say,” replied lordship. “Come here.” Fauntleroy scrambled went him. “Is anything want,” Earl asked; “anything not?” The little fellow's brown eyes fixed grandfather rather wistful look. “Only one thing,” answered. “What that?” inquired Earl. Fauntleroy silent second. He thought matters long nothing. “What it?” lord repeated. Fauntleroy answered. “It Dearest,” said. The old Earl winced little. “But see almost every day,” said. “Is enough?” “I used see time,” said Fauntleroy. “She used kiss I went sleep night, morning always there, could tell things without waiting.” The old eyes young ones looked moment silence. Then Earl knitted brows. “Do NEVER forget mother?” said. “No,” answered Fauntleroy, “never; never forgets me. I forget YOU, know, I live you. I think more.” “Upon word,” said Earl, looking moment longer, “I believe would!” The jealous pang came boy spoke mother seemed even stronger before; stronger old man's increasing affection boy. But long pangs, much harder face almost forgot, time, ever hated son's wife all. And strange startling way happened. One evening, Earl's Court cottages completed, grand dinner party Dorincourt. There party Castle long time. A days took place, Sir Harry Lorridaile Lady Lorridaile, Earl's sister, actually came visit--a thing caused greatest excitement village set Mrs. Dibble's shop-bell tinkling madly again, well known Lady Lorridaile Dorincourt since marriage, thirty-five years before. She handsome old lady white curls dimpled, peachy cheeks, good gold, never approved brother rest world, strong afraid speak mind frankly, had, several lively quarrels lordship, seen little since young days. She heard great deal pleasant years separated. She heard neglect wife, poor lady's death; indifference children; two weak, vicious, unprepossessing elder boys credit one else. Those two elder sons, Bevis Maurice, never seen; come Lorridaile Park tall, stalwart, beautiful young fellow eighteen years old, told nephew Cedric Errol, come see passing near place wished look Aunt Constantia heard mother speak. Lady Lorridaile's kind heart warmed sight young man, made stay week, petted him, made much admired immensely. He sweet-tempered, light-hearted, spirited lad, went away, hoped see often again; never did, Earl bad humor went back Dorincourt, forbidden ever go Lorridaile Park again. But Lady Lorridaile always remembered tenderly, though feared made rash marriage America, angry heard cast father one really knew lived. At last came rumor death, Bevis thrown horse killed, Maurice died Rome fever; soon came story American child found brought home Lord Fauntleroy. “Probably ruined others were,” said husband, “unless mother good enough help take care him.” But heard Cedric's mother parted almost indignant words. “It disgraceful, Harry!” said. “Fancy child age taken mother, made companion man like brother! He either brutal boy indulge little monster. If I thought would good write----” “It would not, Constantia,” said Sir Harry. “I know would not,” answered. “I know lordship Earl Dorincourt well;--but outrageous.” Not poor people farmers heard little Lord Fauntleroy; others knew him. He talked much many stories him--of beauty, sweet temper, popularity, growing influence Earl, grandfather--that rumors reached gentry country places heard one county England. People talked dinner tables, ladies pitied young mother, wondered boy handsome said be, men knew Earl habits laughed heartily stories little fellow's belief lordship's amiability. Sir Thomas Asshe Asshawe Hall, Erleboro one day, met Earl grandson riding together, stopped shake hands lord congratulate change looks recovery gout. “And, d' ye know,” said, spoke incident afterward, “the old man looked proud turkey-cock; upon word I wonder, handsomer, finer lad grandson I never saw! As straight dart, sat pony like young trooper!” And degrees Lady Lorridaile, too, heard child; heard Higgins lame boy, cottages Earl's Court, score things,--and began wish see little fellow. And wondering might brought about, utter astonishment, received letter brother inviting come husband Dorincourt. “It seems incredible!” exclaimed. “I heard said child worked miracles, I begin believe it. They say brother adores boy scarcely endure sight. And proud him! Actually, I believe wants show us.” And accepted invitation once. When reached Dorincourt Castle Sir Harry, late afternoon, went room seeing brother. Having dressed dinner, entered drawing-room. The Earl standing near fire looking tall imposing; side stood little boy black velvet, large Vandyke collar rich lace--a little fellow whose round bright face handsome, turned upon beautiful, candid brown eyes, almost uttered exclamation pleasure surprise sight. As shook hands Earl, called name used since girlhood. “What, Molyneux!” said, “is child?” “Yes, Constantia,” answered Earl, “this boy. Fauntleroy, grand-aunt, Lady Lorridaile.” “How do, Grand-Aunt?” said Fauntleroy. Lady Lorridaile put hand shoulders, looking upraised face seconds, kissed warmly. “I Aunt Constantia,” said, “and I loved poor papa, like him.” “It makes glad I told I like him,” answered Fauntleroy, “because seems every one liked him,--just like Dearest, eszackly,--Aunt Constantia” (adding two words second's pause). Lady Lorridaile delighted. She bent kissed again, moment warm friends. “Well, Molyneux,” said aside Earl afterward, “it could possibly better this!” “I think not,” answered lordship dryly. “He fine little fellow. We great friends. He believes charming sweet-tempered philanthropists. I confess you, Constantia,--as would find I not,--that I slight danger becoming rather old fool him.” “What mother think you?” asked Lady Lorridaile, usual straightforwardness. “I asked her,” answered Earl, slightly scowling. “Well,” said Lady Lorridaile, “I frank outset, Molyneux, tell I approve course, intention call Mrs. Errol soon possible; wish quarrel me, better mention once. What I hear young creature makes quite sure child owes everything. We told even Lorridaile Park poorer tenants adore already.” “They adore HIM,” said Earl, nodding toward Fauntleroy. “As Mrs. Errol, find pretty little woman. I rather debt giving beauty boy, go see like. All I ask remain Court Lodge ask go see her,” scowled little again. “But hate much used to, plain enough me,” ladyship said Sir Harry afterward. “And changed man measure, and, incredible may seem, Harry, opinion made human being, nothing less affection innocent, affectionate little fellow. Why, child actually loves him--leans chair knee. His children would soon thought nestling tiger.” The next day went call upon Mrs. Errol. When returned, said brother: “Molyneux, loveliest little woman I ever saw! She voice like silver bell, may thank making boy is. She given beauty, make great mistake persuading come take charge you. I shall invite Lorridaile.” “She leave boy,” replied Earl. “I must boy too,” said Lady Lorridaile, laughing. But knew Fauntleroy would given her, day saw clearly closely two grown other, proud, grim old man's ambition hope love centered child, warm, innocent nature returned affection perfect trust good faith. She knew, too, prime reason great dinner party Earl's secret desire show world grandson heir, let people see boy much spoken described even finer little specimen boyhood rumor made him. “Bevis Maurice bitter humiliation him,” said husband. “Every one knew it. He actually hated them. His pride full sway here.” Perhaps one person accepted invitation without feeling curiosity little Lord Fauntleroy, wondering would view. And time came view. “The lad good manners,” said Earl. “He one's way. Children usually idiots bores,--mine both,--but actually answer spoken to, silent not. He never offensive.” But allowed silent long. Every one something say him. The fact wished make talk. The ladies petted asked questions, men asked questions too, joked him, men steamer done crossed Atlantic. Fauntleroy quite understand laughed sometimes answered them, used seeing people amused quite serious, mind. He thought whole evening delightful. The magnificent rooms brilliant lights, many flowers, gentlemen seemed gay, ladies wore beautiful, wonderful dresses, sparkling ornaments hair necks. There one young lady who, heard say, come London, spent “season”; charming could keep eyes her. She rather tall young lady proud little head, soft dark hair, large eyes color purple pansies, color cheeks lips like rose. She dressed beautiful white dress, pearls around throat. There one strange thing young lady. So many gentlemen stood near her, seemed anxious please her, Fauntleroy thought must something like princess. He much interested without knowing drew nearer nearer her, last turned spoke him. “Come here, Lord Fauntleroy,” said, smiling; “and tell look so.” “I thinking beautiful are,” young lordship replied. Then gentlemen laughed outright, young lady laughed little too, rose color cheeks brightened. “Ah, Fauntleroy,” said one gentlemen laughed heartily, “make time! When older courage say that.” “But nobody could help saying it,” said Fauntleroy sweetly. “Could help it? Do YOU think pretty, too?” “We allowed say think,” said gentleman, rest laughed ever. But beautiful young lady--her name Miss Vivian Herbert--put hand drew Cedric side, looking prettier before, possible. “Lord Fauntleroy shall say thinks,” said; “and I much obliged him. I sure thinks says.” And kissed cheek. “I think prettier one I ever saw,” said Fauntleroy, looking innocent, admiring eyes, “except Dearest. Of course, I could think one QUITE pretty Dearest. I think prettiest person world.” “I sure is,” said Miss Vivian Herbert. And laughed kissed cheek again. She kept side great part evening, group center gay. He know happened, long telling America, Republican Rally, Mr. Hobbs Dick, end proudly produced pocket Dick's parting gift,--the red silk handkerchief. “I put pocket to-night party,” said. “I thought Dick would like wear party.” And queer big, flaming, spotted thing was, serious, affectionate look eyes, prevented audience laughing much. “You see, I like it,” said, “because Dick friend.” But though talked much, Earl said, one's way. He could quiet listen others talked, one found tiresome. A slight smile crossed one face several times went stood near grandfather's chair, sat stool close him, watching absorbing every word uttered charmed interest. Once stood near chair's arm cheek touched Earl's shoulder, lordship, detecting general smile, smiled little himself. He knew lookers-on thinking, felt secret amusement seeing good friends youngster, might expected share popular opinion him. Mr. Havisham expected arrive afternoon, but, strange say, late. Such thing really never known happen years visitor Dorincourt Castle. He late guests point rising go dinner arrived. When approached host, Earl regarded amazement. He looked hurried agitated; dry, keen old face actually pale. “I detained,” said, low voice Earl, “by--an extraordinary event.” It unlike methodic old lawyer agitated anything late, evident disturbed. At dinner ate scarcely anything, two three times, spoken to, started thoughts far away. At dessert, Fauntleroy came in, looked once, nervously uneasily. Fauntleroy noted look wondered it. He Mr. Havisham friendly terms, usually exchanged smiles. The lawyer seemed forgotten smile evening. The fact was, forgot everything strange painful news knew must tell Earl night over--the strange news knew would terrible shock, would change face everything. As looked splendid rooms brilliant company,--at people gathered together, knew, might see bright-haired little fellow near Earl's chair reason,--as looked proud old man little Lord Fauntleroy smiling side, really felt quite shaken, notwithstanding hardened old lawyer. What blow must deal them! He exactly know long, superb dinner ended. He sat dream, several times saw Earl glance surprise. But last, gentlemen joined ladies drawing-room. They found Fauntleroy sitting sofa Miss Vivian Herbert,--the great beauty last London season; looking pictures, thanking companion door opened. “I ever much obliged kind me!” saying; “I never party before, I enjoyed much!” He enjoyed much gentlemen gathered Miss Herbert began talk her, listened tried understand laughing speeches, eyelids began droop. They drooped covered eyes two three times, sound Miss Herbert's low, pretty laugh would bring back, would open two seconds. He quite sure going sleep, large, yellow satin cushion behind head sank it, eyelids drooped last time. They even quite open when, seemed long time after, one kissed lightly cheek. It Miss Vivian Herbert, going away, spoke softly. “Good-night, little Lord Fauntleroy,” said. “Sleep well.” And morning know tried open eyes murmured sleepily, “Good-night--I so--glad--I saw you--you so--pretty----” He faint recollection hearing gentlemen laugh wondering it. No sooner last guest left room, Mr. Havisham turned place fire, stepped nearer sofa, stood looking sleeping occupant. Little Lord Fauntleroy taking ease luxuriously. One leg crossed swung edge sofa; one arm flung easily head; warm flush healthful, happy, childish sleep quiet face; waving tangle bright hair strayed yellow satin cushion. He made picture well worth looking at. As Mr. Havisham looked it, put hand rubbed shaven chin, harassed countenance. “Well, Havisham,” said Earl's harsh voice behind him. “What it? It evident something happened. What extraordinary event, I may ask?” Mr. Havisham turned sofa, still rubbing chin. “It bad news,” answered, “distressing news, lord--the worst news. I sorry bearer it.” The Earl uneasy time evening, glanced Mr. Havisham, uneasy always ill-tempered. “Why look boy!” exclaimed irritably. “You looking evening if--See now, look boy, Havisham, hang like bird ill-omen! What news Lord Fauntleroy?” “My lord,” said Mr. Havisham, “I waste words. My news everything Lord Fauntleroy. And believe it--it Lord Fauntleroy lies sleeping us, son Captain Errol. And present Lord Fauntleroy son son Bevis, moment lodging-house London.” The Earl clutched arms chair hands veins stood upon them; veins stood forehead too; fierce old face almost livid. “What mean!” cried out. “You mad! Whose lie this?” “If lie,” answered Mr. Havisham, “it painfully like truth. A woman came chambers morning. She said son Bevis married six years ago London. She showed marriage certificate. They quarrelled year marriage, paid keep away him. She son five years old. She American lower classes,--an ignorant person,--and lately fully understand son could claim. She consulted lawyer found boy really Lord Fauntleroy heir earldom Dorincourt; she, course, insists claims acknowledged.” There movement curly head yellow satin cushion. A soft, long, sleepy sigh came parted lips, little boy stirred sleep, restlessly uneasily. Not slumber disturbed fact proved small impostor Lord Fauntleroy never would Earl Dorincourt. He turned rosy face side, enable old man stared solemnly see better. The handsome, grim old face ghastly. A bitter smile fixed upon it. “I refuse believe word it,” said, “if low, scoundrelly piece business becomes quite possible connection name son Bevis. It quite like Bevis. He always disgrace us. Always weak, untruthful, vicious young brute low tastes--my son heir, Bevis, Lord Fauntleroy. The woman ignorant, vulgar person, say?” “I obliged admit scarcely spell name,” answered lawyer. “She absolutely uneducated openly mercenary. She cares nothing money. She handsome coarse way, but----” The fastidious old lawyer ceased speaking gave sort shudder. The veins old Earl's forehead stood like purple cords. Something else stood upon too--cold drops moisture. He took handkerchief swept away. His smile grew even bitter. “And I,” said, “I objected to--to woman, mother child” (pointing sleeping form sofa); “I refused recognize her. And yet could spell name. I suppose retribution.” Suddenly sprang chair began walk room. Fierce terrible words poured forth lips. His rage hatred cruel disappointment shook storm shakes tree. His violence something dreadful see, yet Mr. Havisham noticed worst wrath never seemed forget little sleeping figure yellow satin cushion, never spoke loud enough awaken it. “I might known it,” said. “They disgrace first hour! I hated both; hated me! Bevis worse two. I believe yet, though! I contend last. But like Bevis--it like him!” And raged asked questions woman, proofs, pacing room, turned first white purple repressed fury. When last learned told, knew worst, Mr. Havisham looked feeling anxiety. He looked broken haggard changed. His rages always bad him, one worse rest something rage it. He came slowly back sofa, last, stood near it. “If one told I could fond child,” said, harsh voice low unsteady, “I believed them. I always detested children--my rest. I fond one; fond me” (with bitter smile). “I popular; I never was. But fond me. He never afraid me--he always trusted me. He would filled place better I filled it. I know that. He would honor name.” He bent stood minute looking happy, sleeping face. His shaggy eyebrows knitted fiercely, yet somehow seem fierce all. He put hand, pushed bright hair back forehead, turned away rang bell. When largest footman appeared, pointed sofa. “Take”--he said, voice changed little--“take Lord Fauntleroy room.” XI When Mr. Hobbs's young friend left go Dorincourt Castle become Lord Fauntleroy, grocery-man time realize Atlantic Ocean lay small companion spent many agreeable hours society, really began feel lonely indeed. The fact was, Mr. Hobbs clever man even bright one; was, indeed, rather slow heavy person, never made many acquaintances. He mentally energetic enough know amuse himself, truth never anything entertaining nature read newspapers add accounts. It easy add accounts, sometimes took long time bring right; old days, little Lord Fauntleroy, learned add quite nicely fingers slate pencil, sometimes even gone length trying help him; and, too, good listener taken interest newspaper said, Mr. Hobbs held long conversations Revolution British elections Republican party, wonder going left blank grocery store. At first seemed Mr. Hobbs Cedric really far away, would come back again; day would look paper see little lad standing door-way, white suit red stockings, straw hat back head, would hear say cheerful little voice: “Hello, Mr. Hobbs! This hot day--is it?” But days passed happen, Mr. Hobbs felt dull uneasy. He even enjoy newspaper much used to. He would put paper knee reading it, sit stare high stool long time. There marks long legs made feel quite dejected melancholy. They marks made heels next Earl Dorincourt, kicked talked time. It seems even youthful earls kick legs things sit on;--noble blood lofty lineage prevent it. After looking marks, Mr. Hobbs would take gold watch open stare inscription: “From oldest friend, Lord Fauntleroy, Mr. Hobbs. When see, remember me.” And staring awhile, would shut loud snap, sigh get go stand door-way--between box potatoes barrel apples--and look street. At night, store closed, would light pipe walk slowly along pavement reached house Cedric lived, sign read, “This House Let”; would stop near look shake head, puff pipe hard, walk mournfully back again. This went two three weeks new idea came him. Being slow ponderous, always took long time reach new idea. As rule, like new ideas, preferred old ones. After two three weeks, however, which, instead getting better, matters really grew worse, novel plan slowly deliberately dawned upon him. He would go see Dick. He smoked great many pipes arrived conclusion, finally arrive it. He would go see Dick. He knew Dick. Cedric told him, idea perhaps Dick might comfort way talking things over. So one day Dick hard work blacking customer's boots, short, stout man heavy face bald head stopped pavement stared two three minutes bootblack's sign, read: “PROFESSOR DICK TIPTON CANNOT BE BEAT.” He stared long Dick began take lively interest him, put finishing touch customer's boots, said: “Want shine, sir?” The stout man came forward deliberately put foot rest. “Yes,” said. Then Dick fell work, stout man looked Dick sign sign Dick. “Where get that?” asked. “From friend mine,” said Dick,--“a little feller. He guv' whole outfit. He best little feller ye ever saw. He England now. Gone one lords.” “Lord--Lord--” asked Mr. Hobbs, ponderous slowness, “Lord Fauntleroy--Going Earl Dorincourt?” Dick almost dropped brush. “Why, boss!” exclaimed, “d' ye know yerself?” “I known him,” answered Mr. Hobbs, wiping warm forehead, “ever since born. We lifetime acquaintances--that WE was.” It really made feel quite agitated speak it. He pulled splendid gold watch pocket opened it, showed inside case Dick. “'When see, remember me,'” read. “That parting keepsake me. 'I want forget me'--those words--I would ha' remembered him,” went on, shaking head, “if given thing an' I seen hide hair again. He companion ANY man would remember.” “He nicest little feller I ever see,” said Dick. “An' sand--I never seen much sand little feller. I thought heap him, I did,--an' friends, too--we sort chums fust, little young un an' me. I grabbed ball stage fur him, an' never forgot it; an' would come here, would, mother nuss would holler: 'Hello, Dick!' me, friendly six feet high, warn't knee high grasshopper, dressed gal's clo'es. He gay little chap, luck, good talk him.” “That so,” said Mr. Hobbs. “It pity make earl HIM. He would SHONE grocery business--or dry goods either; would SHONE!” And shook head deeper regret ever. It proved much say possible say one time, agreed next night Dick make visit store keep Mr. Hobbs company. The plan pleased Dick well enough. He street waif nearly life, never bad boy, always private yearning respectable kind existence. Since business himself, made enough money enable sleep roof instead streets, begun hope might reach even higher plane, time. So, invited call stout, respectable man owned corner store, even horse wagon, seemed quite event. “Do know anything earls castles?” Mr. Hobbs inquired. “I would like know particklars.” “There story Penny Story Gazette,” said Dick. “It called 'Crime Coronet; or, The Revenge Countess May.' It boss thing, too. Some us boys takin' read.” “Bring come,” said Mr. Hobbs, “an' I pay it. Bring find earls them. If earls, markises'll do, dooks--though HE never made mention dooks markises. We go coronets little, I never happened see any. I guess keep 'round here.” “Tiffany would anybody did,” said Dick, “but I know I would know one I saw it.” Mr. Hobbs explain would known one saw it. He merely shook head ponderously. “I s'pose little call them,” said, ended matter. This beginning quite substantial friendship. When Dick went store, Mr. Hobbs received great hospitality. He gave chair tilted door, near barrel apples, young visitor seated, made jerk hand held pipe, saying: “Help yerself.” Then looked story papers, read discussed British aristocracy; Mr. Hobbs smoked pipe hard shook head great deal. He shook pointed high stool marks legs. “There kicks,” said impressively; “his kicks. I sit look hour. This world ups an' world downs. Why, would set there, an' eat crackers box, an' apples barrel, an' pitch cores street; an' lord a-livin' castle. Them's lord's kicks; earl's kicks day. Sometimes I says myself, says I, 'Well, I jiggered!'” He seemed derive great deal comfort reflections Dick's visit. Before Dick went home, supper small back-room; crackers cheese sardines, canned things store, Mr. Hobbs solemnly opened two bottles ginger ale, pouring two glasses, proposed toast. “Here HIM!” said, lifting glass, “an' may teach lesson--earls an' markises an' dooks an' all!” After night, two saw often, Mr. Hobbs much comfortable less desolate. They read Penny Story Gazette, many interesting things, gained knowledge habits nobility gentry would surprised despised classes realized it. One day Mr. Hobbs made pilgrimage book store town, express purpose adding library. He went clerk leaned counter speak him. “I want,” said, “a book earls.” “What!” exclaimed clerk. “A book,” repeated grocery-man, “about earls.” “I afraid,” said clerk, looking rather queer, “that want.” “Have not?” said Mr. Hobbs, anxiously. “Well, say markises then--or dooks.” “I know book,” answered clerk. Mr. Hobbs much disturbed. He looked floor,--then looked up. “None female earls?” inquired. “I afraid not,” said clerk smile. “Well,” exclaimed Mr. Hobbs, “I jiggered!” He going store, clerk called back asked story nobility chief characters would do. Mr. Hobbs said would--if could get entire volume devoted earls. So clerk sold book called “The Tower London,” written Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, carried home. When Dick came began read it. It wonderful exciting book, scene laid reign famous English queen called people Bloody Mary. And Mr. Hobbs heard Queen Mary's deeds habit chopping people's heads off, putting torture, burning alive, became much excited. He took pipe mouth stared Dick, last obliged mop perspiration brow red pocket handkerchief. “Why, safe!” said. “He safe! If women folks sit thrones an' give word things like done, know happening minute? He safe nothing! Just let woman like get mad, an' one's safe!” “Well,” said Dick, though looked rather anxious himself; “ye see 'ere un one bossin' things now. I know name's Victory, an' un book, name's Mary.” “So is,” said Mr. Hobbs, still mopping forehead; “so is. An' newspapers sayin' anything racks, thumb-screws, stake-burnin's,--but still seem 't safe queer folks. Why, tell keep Fourth July!” He privately uneasy several days; received Fauntleroy's letter read several times, Dick, also read letter Dick got time, became composed again. But found great pleasure letters. They read re-read them, talked enjoyed every word them. And spent days answers sent read almost often letters received. It rather labor Dick write his. All knowledge reading writing gained months, lived elder brother, gone night-school; but, sharp boy, made brief education, spelled things newspapers since then, practiced writing bits chalk pavements walls fences. He told Mr. Hobbs life elder brother, rather good mother died, Dick quite little fellow. Their father died time before. The brother's name Ben, taken care Dick well could, boy old enough sell newspapers run errands. They lived together, grew older Ben managed get along quite decent place store. “And then,” exclaimed Dick disgust, “blest go an' marry gal! Just went got spoony an' sense left! Married her, an' set housekeepin' two back rooms. An' hefty un was,--a regular tiger-cat. She would tear things pieces got mad,--and mad ALL time. Had baby like her,--yell day 'n' night! An' I 'tend it! an' screamed, would fire things me. She fired plate one day, an' hit baby-- cut chin. Doctor said would carry mark till died. A nice mother was! Crackey! time--Ben 'n' mehself 'n' young un. She mad Ben make money faster; 'n' last went West man set cattle ranch. An' gone week 'fore one night, I got home sellin' papers, 'n' rooms wus locked 'n' empty, 'n' woman house, told Minna would gone--shown clean pair heels. Some un else said would gone across water nuss lady little baby, too. Never heard word since--nuther Ben. If I would ha' bin him, I would ha' fretted bit--'n' I guess not. But thought heap start. Tell you, spoons her. She daisy-lookin' gal, too, dressed 'n' mad. She would big black eyes 'n' black hair knees; would make rope big arm, twist 'round 'n' 'round head; 'n' I tell eyes would snap! Folks used say part _I_tali-un--said mother father would come there, 'n' made queer. I tell ye, one them--she was!” He often told Mr. Hobbs stories brother Ben, who, since going West, written twice Dick. Ben's luck good, wandered place place; last settled ranch California, work time Dick became acquainted Mr. Hobbs. “That gal,” said Dick one day, “she took grit him. I could help feelin' sorry sometimes.” They sitting store door-way together, Mr. Hobbs filling pipe. “He ought 've married,” said solemnly, rose get match. “Women--I never could see use myself.” As took match box, stopped looked counter. “Why!” said, “if letter! I see before. The postman must laid I noticin', newspaper slipped it.” He picked looked carefully. “It HIM!” exclaimed. “That one from!” He forgot pipe altogether. He went back chair quite excited took pocket-knife opened envelope. “I wonder news time,” said. And unfolded letter read follows: “DORINCOURT CASTLE” My dear Mr. Hobbs “I write great hury becaus something curous tell know mutch suprised dear frend tel you. It mistake lord shall earl lady whitch marid uncle bevis dead little boy lord fauntleroy becaus way England earls eldest sons little boy earl every body else dead mean farther grandfarther dead grandfarther dead uncle bevis boy lord Fauntleroy becaus papa youngest son name Cedric Errol like New York things belong boy thought first give pony cart grandfarther says need grandfarther sorry think like lady preaps thinks dearest sorry shall earl would like earl better thout would first becaus beautifle castle like every body rich many things rich becaus papa youngest son rich going learn work take care dearest asking Wilkins grooming horses preaps might groom coachman.

It always habit say, “I WILL jiggered,” time said, “I AM jiggered.” Perhaps really WAS jiggered. There knowing. “Well,” said Dick, “the whole thing's bust up, it?” “Bust!” said Mr. Hobbs. “It opinion put-up job British ristycrats rob rights American. They spite agin us ever since Revolution, an' takin' him. I told safe, an' see happened! Like not, whole gover'ment's got together rob lawful ownin's.” He much agitated. He approved change young friend's circumstances first, lately become reconciled it, receipt Cedric's letter perhaps even felt secret pride young friend's magnificence. He might good opinion earls, knew even America money considered rather agreeable thing, wealth grandeur go title, must rather hard lose it. “They trying rob him!” said, “that doing, folks money ought look him.” And kept Dick quite late hour talk over, young man left, went corner street; way back stopped opposite empty house time, staring “To Let,” smoking pipe, much disturbance mind. XII A days dinner party Castle, almost everybody England read newspapers knew romantic story happened Dorincourt. It made interesting story told details. There little American boy brought England Lord Fauntleroy, said fine handsome little fellow, already made people fond him; old Earl, grandfather, proud heir; pretty young mother never forgiven marrying Captain Errol; strange marriage Bevis, dead Lord Fauntleroy, strange wife, one knew anything, suddenly appearing son, saying real Lord Fauntleroy must rights. All things talked written about, caused tremendous sensation. And came rumor Earl Dorincourt satisfied turn affairs taken, would perhaps contest claim law, matter might end wonderful trial. There never excitement county Erleboro situated. On market-days, people stood groups talked wondered would done; farmers' wives invited one another tea might tell one another heard thought thought people thought. They related wonderful anecdotes Earl's rage determination acknowledge new Lord Fauntleroy, hatred woman claimant's mother. But, course, Mrs. Dibble could tell most, demand ever. “An' bad lookout is,” said. “An' ask me, madam, I say judgment way treated sweet young cre'tur' parted child,--for got fond an' set an' proud a'most drove mad happened. An' more, new one's lady, little lordship's is. She bold-faced, black-eyed thing, Mr. Thomas says gentleman livery 'you'd bemean hisself gave orders by; let come house, says, an' goes it. An' boy compare one nothing could mention. An' mercy knows going come all, an' end, an' might knocked feather Jane brought news.” In fact excitement everywhere Castle: library, Earl Mr. Havisham sat talked; servants' hall, Mr. Thomas butler men women servants gossiped exclaimed times day; stables, Wilkins went work quite depressed state mind, groomed brown pony beautifully ever, said mournfully coachman “never taught young gen'leman ride took nat'ral, better-plucked one was. He one pleasure ride behind.” But midst disturbance one person quite calm untroubled. That person little Lord Fauntleroy said Lord Fauntleroy all. When first state affairs explained him, felt little anxiousness perplexity, true, foundation baffled ambition. While Earl told happened, sat stool holding knee, often listening anything interesting; time story finished looked quite sober. “It makes feel queer,” said; “it makes feel--queer!” The Earl looked boy silence. It made feel queer, too--queerer ever felt whole life. And felt queer still saw troubled expression small face usually happy. “Will take Dearest's house her--and carriage?” Cedric asked rather unsteady, anxious little voice. “NO!” said Earl decidedly--in quite loud voice, fact. “They take nothing her.” “Ah!” said Cedric, evident relief. “Cannot they?” Then looked grandfather, wistful shade eyes, looked big soft. “That boy,” said rather tremulously--“he to--to boy now--as I was--will he?” “NO!” answered Earl--and said fiercely loudly Cedric quite jumped. “No?” exclaimed, wonderment. “Will he? I thought----” He stood stool quite suddenly. “Shall I boy, even I going earl?” said. “Shall I boy, I before?” And flushed little face alight eagerness. How old Earl look head foot, sure! How great shaggy brows draw together, queerly deep eyes shone them--how queerly! “My boy!” said--and, believe it, voice queer, almost shaky little broken hoarse, would expect Earl's voice be, though spoke decidedly peremptorily even before,--“Yes, boy long I live; and, George, sometimes I feel boy I ever had.” Cedric's face turned red roots hair; turned red relief pleasure. He put hands deep pockets looked squarely noble relative's eyes. “Do you?” said. “Well, then, I care earl part all. I care whether I earl not. I thought--you see, I thought one going Earl would boy, too, and--and I could be. That made feel queer.” The Earl put hand shoulder drew nearer. “They shall take nothing I hold you,” said, drawing breath hard. “I believe yet take anything you. You made place, and--well, may fill still. But whatever comes, shall I give you--all!” It scarcely seemed speaking child, determination face voice; making promise himself--and perhaps was. He never known deep hold upon fondness boy pride taken. He never seen strength good qualities beauty seemed see now. To obstinate nature seemed impossible--more impossible--to give set heart upon. And determined would give without fierce struggle. Within days seen Mr. Havisham, woman claimed Lady Fauntleroy presented Castle, brought child her. She sent away. The Earl would see her, told footman door; lawyer would attend case. It Thomas gave message, expressed opinion freely afterward, servants' hall. He “hoped,” said, “as wore livery 'igh famblies long enough know lady see one, an' lady judge females.” “The one Lodge,” added Thomas loftily, “'Merican 'Merican, one right sort, gentleman 'you'd reckinize heye. I remarked Henery fust called there.” The woman drove away; look handsome, common face half frightened, half fierce. Mr. Havisham noticed, interviews her, though passionate temper, coarse, insolent manner, neither clever bold meant be; seemed sometimes almost overwhelmed position placed herself. It expected meet opposition. “She evidently,” lawyer said Mrs. Errol, “a person lower walks life. She uneducated untrained everything, quite unused meeting people like terms equality. She know do. Her visit Castle quite cowed her. She infuriated, cowed. The Earl would receive her, I advised go Dorincourt Arms, staying. When saw enter room, turned white, though flew rage once, threatened demanded one breath.” The fact Earl stalked room stood, looking like venerable aristocratic giant, staring woman beetling brows, condescending word. He simply stared her, taking head foot repulsive curiosity. He let talk demand tired, without uttering word, said: “You say eldest son's wife. If true, proof offer much us, law side. In case, boy Lord Fauntleroy. The matter sifted bottom, may rest assured. If claims proved, provided for. I want see nothing either child long I live. The place unfortunately enough death. You exactly kind person I expected son Bevis choose.” And turned back upon stalked room stalked it. Not many days that, visitor announced Mrs. Errol, writing little morning room. The maid, brought message, looked rather excited; eyes quite round amazement, fact, young inexperienced, regarded mistress nervous sympathy. “It Earl hisself, madam!” said tremulous awe. When Mrs. Errol entered drawing-room, tall, majestic-looking old man standing tiger-skin rug. He handsome, grim old face, aquiline profile, long white mustache, obstinate look. “Mrs. Errol, I believe?” said. “Mrs. Errol,” answered. “I Earl Dorincourt,” said. He paused moment, almost unconsciously, look uplifted eyes. They like big, affectionate, childish eyes seen uplifted often every day last months, gave quite curious sensation. “The boy like you,” said abruptly. “It often said so, lord,” replied, “but I glad think like father also.” As Lady Lorridaile told him, voice sweet, manner simple dignified. She seem least troubled sudden coming. “Yes,” said Earl, “he like--my son--too.” He put hand big white mustache pulled fiercely. “Do know,” said, “why I come here?” “I seen Mr. Havisham,” Mrs. Errol began, “and told claims made----” “I come tell you,” said Earl, “that investigated contested, contest made. I come tell boy shall defended power law. His rights----” The soft voice interrupted him. “He must nothing NOT right, even law give him,” said. “Unfortunately law not,” said Earl. “If could, should. This outrageous woman child----” “Perhaps cares much I care Cedric, lord,” said little Mrs. Errol. “And eldest son's wife, son Lord Fauntleroy, mine not.” She afraid Cedric been, looked Cedric would looked, he, old tyrant life, privately pleased it. People seldom dared differ entertaining novelty it. “I suppose,” said, scowling slightly, “that would much prefer Earl Dorincourt.” Her fair young face flushed. “It magnificent thing Earl Dorincourt, lord,” said. “I know that, I care father was--brave true always.” “In striking contrast grandfather was, eh?” said lordship sardonically. “I pleasure knowing grandfather,” replied Mrs. Errol, “but I know little boy believes----” She stopped short moment, looking quietly face, added, “I know Cedric loves you.” “Would loved me,” said Earl dryly, “if told I receive Castle?” “No,” answered Mrs. Errol, “I think not. That I wish know.” “Well,” said lord brusquely, “there women would told him.” He suddenly began walk room, pulling great mustache violently ever. “Yes, fond me,” said, “and I fond him. I cannot say I ever fond anything before. I fond him. He pleased first. I old man, tired life. He given something live for. I proud him. I satisfied think taking place day head family.” He came back stood Mrs. Errol. “I miserable,” said. “Miserable!” He looked was. Even pride could keep voice steady hands shaking. For moment almost seemed deep, fierce eyes tears them. “Perhaps I miserable I come you,” said, quite glaring her. “I used hate you; I jealous you. This wretched, disgraceful business changed that. After seeing repulsive woman calls wife son Bevis, I actually felt would relief look you. I obstinate old fool, I suppose I treated badly. You like boy, boy first object life. I miserable, I came merely like boy, cares you, I care him. Treat well can, boy's sake.” He said harsh voice, almost roughly, somehow seemed broken time Mrs. Errol touched heart. She got moved arm-chair little forward. “I wish would sit down,” said soft, pretty, sympathetic way. “You much troubled tired, need strength.” It new spoken cared gentle, simple way contradicted. He reminded “the boy” again, actually asked him. Perhaps disappointment wretchedness good discipline him; wretched might continued hate her, present found little soothing. Almost anything would seemed pleasant contrast Lady Fauntleroy; one sweet face voice, pretty dignity spoke moved. Very soon, quiet magic influences, began feel less gloomy, talked still more. “Whatever happens,” said, “the boy shall provided for. He shall taken care of, future.” Before went away, glanced around room. “Do like house?” demanded. “Very much,” answered. “This cheerful room,” said. “May I come talk matter over?” “As often wish, lord,” replied. And went carriage drove away, Thomas Henry almost stricken dumb upon box turn affairs taken. XIII OF course, soon story Lord Fauntleroy difficulties Earl Dorincourt discussed English newspapers, discussed American newspapers. The story interesting passed lightly, talked great deal. There many versions would edifying thing buy papers compare them. Mr. Hobbs read much became quite bewildered. One paper described young friend Cedric infant arms,--another young man Oxford, winning honors, distinguishing writing Greek poems; one said engaged young lady great beauty, daughter duke; another said married; thing, fact, NOT said little boy seven eight, handsome legs curly hair. One said relation Earl Dorincourt all, small impostor sold newspapers slept streets New York mother imposed upon family lawyer, came America look Earl's heir. Then came descriptions new Lord Fauntleroy mother. Sometimes gypsy, sometimes actress, sometimes beautiful Spaniard; always agreed Earl Dorincourt deadly enemy, would acknowledge son heir could help it, seemed slight flaw papers produced, expected would long trial, would far interesting anything ever carried court before. Mr. Hobbs used read papers head whirl, evening Dick would talk over. They found important personage Earl Dorincourt was, magnificent income possessed, many estates owned, stately beautiful Castle lived; learned, excited became. “Seems like something orter done,” said Mr. Hobbs. “Things like orter held to--earls earls.” But really nothing could write letter Cedric, containing assurances friendship sympathy. They wrote letters soon could receiving news; written them, handed read. This Mr. Hobbs read Dick's letter: “DERE FREND: got ure letter Mr. Hobbs got sory ure luck say hold longs kin let one git ahed you. There lot ole theves wil make al kin ef kepe ure skined. But mosly say forgot wot fur better way cum go pardners me. Biznes fine ile see harm cums Enny big feler trise cum wil hafter setle fust Perfessor Dick Tipton. So present “DICK.” And Dick read Mr. Hobbs's letter: “DEAR SIR: Yrs received wd say things looks bad. I believe put job done ought looked sharp. And I write say two things. I Am going look thing up. Keep quiet Ill see lawyer I And worst happens earls many us partnership grocery business ready yure old enough home friend “Yrs truly, “SILAS HOBBS.” “Well,” said Mr. Hobbs, “he pervided us, earl.” “So is,” said Dick. “I would ha' stood him. Blest I like little feller fust-rate.” The next morning, one Dick's customers rather surprised. He young lawyer beginning practice--as poor young lawyer possibly be, bright, energetic young fellow, sharp wit good temper. He shabby office near Dick's stand, every morning Dick blacked boots him, quite often exactly water-tight, always friendly word joke Dick. That particular morning, put foot rest, illustrated paper hand--an enterprising paper, pictures conspicuous people things. He finished looking over, last boot polished, handed boy. “Here paper you, Dick,” said; “you look drop Delmonico's breakfast. Picture English castle it, English earl's daughter-in-law. Fine young woman, too,--lots hair,--though seems raising rather row. You ought become familiar nobility gentry, Dick. Begin Right Honorable Earl Dorincourt Lady Fauntleroy. Hello! I say, matter?” The pictures spoke front page, Dick staring one eyes mouth open, sharp face almost pale excitement. “What pay, Dick?” said young man. “What paralyzed you?” Dick really look something tremendous happened. He pointed picture, written: “Mother Claimant (Lady Fauntleroy).” It picture handsome woman, large eyes heavy braids black hair wound around head. “Her!” said Dick. “My, I know better 'n I know you!” The young man began laugh. “Where meet her, Dick?” said. “At Newport? Or ran Paris last time?” Dick actually forgot grin. He began gather brushes things together, something would put end business present. “Never mind,” said. “I know her! An I struck work mornin'.” And less five minutes time tearing streets way Mr. Hobbs corner store. Mr. Hobbs could scarcely believe evidence senses looked across counter saw Dick rush paper hand. The boy breath running; much breath, fact, could scarcely speak threw paper counter. “Hello!” exclaimed Mr. Hobbs. “Hello! What got there?” “Look it!” panted Dick. “Look woman picture! That look at! SHE 'ristocrat, SHE not!” withering scorn. “She lord's wife. You may eat me, Minna--MINNA! I would know anywheres, an' would Ben. Jest ax him.” Mr. Hobbs dropped seat. “I knowed put-up job,” said. “I knowed it; done account bein' 'Merican!” “Done it!” cried Dick, disgust. “SHE done it, done it. She allers tricks; an' I tell yer wot come me, minnit I saw pictur. There one papers saw letter said something 'bout boy, an' said scar chin. Put two together--her 'n' scar! Why, boy lord I am! It BEN'S boy,--the little chap hit let fly plate me.” Professor Dick Tipton always sharp boy, earning living streets big city made still sharper. He learned keep eyes open wits him, must confessed enjoyed immensely excitement impatience moment. If little Lord Fauntleroy could looked store morning, would certainly interested, even discussion plans intended decide fate boy himself. Mr. Hobbs almost overwhelmed sense responsibility, Dick alive full energy. He began write letter Ben, cut picture inclosed him, Mr. Hobbs wrote letter Cedric one Earl. They midst letter-writing new idea came Dick. “Say,” said, “the feller give paper, lawyer. Let us ax would better do. Lawyers knows all.” Mr. Hobbs immensely impressed suggestion Dick's business capacity. “That so!” replied. “This calls lawyers.” And leaving store care substitute, struggled coat marched down-town Dick, two presented romantic story Mr. Harrison's office, much young man's astonishment. If young lawyer, enterprising mind great deal spare time hands, might readily interested say, certainly sounded wild queer; chanced want something much, chanced know Dick, Dick chanced say say sharp, telling sort way. “And,” said Mr. Hobbs, “say time's worth a' hour look thing thorough, I WILL pay damage,--Silas Hobbs, corner Blank street, Vegetables Fancy Groceries.” “Well,” said Mr. Harrison, “it big thing turns right, almost big thing Lord Fauntleroy; and, rate, harm done investigating. It appears dubiousness child. The woman contradicted statements age, aroused suspicion. The first persons written Dick's brother Earl Dorincourt's family lawyer.” And actually, sun went down, two letters written sent two different directions--one speeding New York harbor mail steamer way England, train carrying letters passengers bound California. And first addressed T. Havisham, Esq., second Benjamin Tipton. And store closed evening, Mr. Hobbs Dick sat back-room talked together midnight. XIV It astonishing short time takes wonderful things happen. It taken minutes, apparently, change fortunes little boy dangling red legs high stool Mr. Hobbs's store, transform small boy, living simplest life quiet street, English nobleman, heir earldom magnificent wealth. It taken minutes, apparently, change English nobleman penniless little impostor, right splendors enjoying. And, surprising may appear, take nearly long time one might expected, alter face everything give back danger losing. It took less time because, all, woman called Lady Fauntleroy nearly clever wicked; closely pressed Mr. Havisham's questions marriage boy, made one two blunders caused suspicion awakened; lost presence mind temper, excitement anger betrayed still further. All mistakes made child. There seemed doubt married Bevis, Lord Fauntleroy, quarreled paid keep away him; Mr. Havisham found story boy's born certain part London false; midst commotion caused discovery, came letter young lawyer New York, Mr. Hobbs's letters also. What evening letters arrived, Mr. Havisham Earl sat talked plans library! “After first three meetings her,” said Mr. Havisham, “I began suspect strongly. It appeared child older said was, made slip speaking date birth tried patch matter up. The story letters bring fits several suspicions. Our best plan cable two Tiptons,--say nothing her,--and suddenly confront expecting it. She clumsy plotter, all. My opinion frightened wits, betray spot.” And actually happened. She told nothing, Mr. Havisham kept suspecting anything continuing interviews her, assured investigating statements; really began feel secure spirits rose immensely began insolent might expected. But one fine morning, sat sitting-room inn called “The Dorincourt Arms,” making fine plans herself, Mr. Havisham announced; entered, followed less three persons--one sharp-faced boy one big young man third Earl Dorincourt. She sprang feet actually uttered cry terror. It broke time check it. She thought new-comers thousands miles away, ever thought all, scarcely done years. She never expected see again. It must confessed Dick grinned little saw her. “Hello, Minna!” said. The big young man--who Ben--stood still minute looked her. “Do know her?” Mr. Havisham asked, glancing one other. “Yes,” said Ben. “I know knows me.” And turned back went stood looking window, sight hateful him, indeed was. Then woman, seeing baffled exposed, lost control flew rage Ben Dick often seen before. Dick grinned trifle watched heard names called violent threats made, Ben turn look her. “I swear court,” said Mr. Havisham, “and I bring dozen others will. Her father respectable sort man, though low world. Her mother like herself. She dead, alive, honest enough ashamed her. He tell is, whether married not.” Then clenched hand suddenly turned her. “Where child?” demanded. “He going me! He done you, I!” And finished saying words, door leading bedroom opened little, boy, probably attracted sound loud voices, looked in. He handsome boy, rather nice face, quite like Ben, father, one could see, three-cornered scar chin. Ben walked took hand, trembling. “Yes,” said, “I could swear him, too. Tom,” said little fellow, “I father; I come take away. Where hat?” The boy pointed lay chair. It evidently rather pleased hear going away. He accustomed queer experiences surprise told stranger father. He objected much woman come months place lived since babyhood, suddenly announced mother, quite ready change. Ben took hat marched door. “If want again,” said Mr. Havisham, “you know find me.” He walked room, holding child's hand looking woman once. She fairly raving fury, Earl calmly gazing eyeglasses, quietly placed upon aristocratic, eagle nose. “Come, come, young woman,” said Mr. Havisham. “This all. If want locked up, really must behave yourself.” And something business-like tones that, probably feeling safest thing could would get way, gave one savage look dashed past next room slammed door. “We shall trouble her,” said Mr. Havisham. And right; night left Dorincourt Arms took train London, seen more. When Earl left room interview, went carriage. “To Court Lodge,” said Thomas. “To Court Lodge,” said Thomas coachman mounted box; “an' may depend it, things taking uniggspected turn.” When carriage stopped Court Lodge, Cedric drawing-room mother. The Earl came without announced. He looked inch taller, great many years younger. His deep eyes flashed. “Where,” said, “is Lord Fauntleroy?” Mrs. Errol came forward, flush rising cheek. “Is Lord Fauntleroy?” asked. “Is it, indeed!” The Earl put hand grasped hers. “Yes,” answered, “it is.” Then put hand Cedric's shoulder. “Fauntleroy,” said unceremonious, authoritative way, “ask mother come us Castle.” Fauntleroy flung arms around mother's neck. “To live us!” cried. “To live us always!” The Earl looked Mrs. Errol, Mrs. Errol looked Earl. His lordship entirely earnest. He made mind waste time arranging matter. He begun think would suit make friends heir's mother. “Are quite sure want me?” said Mrs. Errol, soft, pretty smile. “Quite sure,” said bluntly. “We always wanted you, exactly aware it. We hope come.” XV Ben took boy went back cattle ranch California, returned comfortable circumstances. Just going, Mr. Havisham interview lawyer told Earl Dorincourt wished something boy might turned Lord Fauntleroy, decided would good plan invest cattle ranch own, put Ben charge terms would make pay well, would lay foundation son's future. And Ben went away, went prospective master ranch would almost good own, might easily become time, indeed course years; Tom, boy, grew fine young man devotedly fond father; successful happy Ben used say Tom made troubles ever had. But Dick Mr. Hobbs--who actually come others see things properly looked after--did return time. It decided outset Earl would provide Dick, would see received solid education; Mr. Hobbs decided left reliable substitute charge store, could afford wait see festivities celebrate Lord Fauntleroy's eighth birthday. All tenantry invited, feasting dancing games park, bonfires fire-works evening. “Just like Fourth July!” said Lord Fauntleroy. “It seems pity birthday Fourth, it? For could keep together.” It must confessed first Earl Mr. Hobbs intimate might hoped would become, interests British aristocracy. The fact Earl known grocery-men, Mr. Hobbs many close acquaintances earls; rare interviews conversation flourish. It must also owned Mr. Hobbs rather overwhelmed splendors Fauntleroy felt duty show him. The entrance gate stone lions avenue impressed Mr. Hobbs somewhat beginning, saw Castle, flower-gardens, hot-houses, terraces, peacocks, dungeon, armor, great staircase, stables, liveried servants, really quite bewildered. But picture gallery seemed finishing stroke. “Something manner museum?” said Fauntleroy, led great, beautiful room. “N--no--!” said Fauntleroy, rather doubtfully. “I THINK museum. My grandfather says ancestors.” “Your aunt's sisters!” ejaculated Mr. Hobbs. “ALL them? Your great-uncle, MUST family! Did raise all?” And sank seat looked around quite agitated countenance, greatest difficulty Lord Fauntleroy managed explain walls lined entirely portraits progeny great-uncle. He found necessary, fact, call assistance Mrs. Mellon, knew pictures, could tell painted when, added romantic stories lords ladies originals. When Mr. Hobbs understood, heard stories, much fascinated liked picture gallery almost better anything else; would often walk village, staid Dorincourt Arms, would spend half hour wandering gallery, staring painted ladies gentlemen, also stared him, shaking head nearly time. “And earls!” would say, “er pretty nigh it! An' HE IS going one them, an' all!” Privately nearly much disgusted earls mode life expected be, doubted whether strictly republican principles shaken little closer acquaintance castles ancestors rest it. At rate, one day uttered remarkable unexpected sentiment: “I would minded bein' one myself!” said--which really great concession. What grand day little Lord Fauntleroy's birthday arrived, young lordship enjoyed it! How beautiful park looked, filled thronging people dressed gayest best, flags flying tents top Castle! Nobody staid away could possibly come, everybody really glad little Lord Fauntleroy little Lord Fauntleroy still, day master everything. Every one wanted look him, pretty, kind mother, made many friends. And positively every one liked Earl rather better, felt amiably toward little boy loved trusted so, because, also, made friends behaved respectfully heir's mother. It said even beginning fond her, too, young lordship young lordship's mother, Earl might changed time quite well-behaved old nobleman, everybody might happier better off. What scores scores people trees, tents, lawns! Farmers farmers' wives Sunday suits bonnets shawls; girls sweethearts; children frolicking chasing about; old dames red cloaks gossiping together. At Castle, ladies gentlemen come see fun, congratulate Earl, meet Mrs. Errol. Lady Lorredaile Sir Harry there, Sir Thomas Asshe daughters, Mr. Havisham, course, beautiful Miss Vivian Herbert, loveliest white gown lace parasol, circle gentlemen take care her--though evidently liked Fauntleroy better put together. And saw ran put arm around neck, put arms around him, too, kissed warmly favorite little brother, said: “Dear little Lord Fauntleroy! dear little boy! I glad! I glad!” And afterward walked grounds him, let show everything. And took Mr. Hobbs Dick were, said her, “This old, old friend Mr. Hobbs, Miss Herbert, old friend Dick. I told pretty were, I told see came birthday,”--she shook hands both, stood talked prettiest way, asking America voyage life since England; Fauntleroy stood by, looking adoring eyes, cheeks quite flushed delight saw Mr. Hobbs Dick liked much. “Well,” said Dick solemnly, afterward, “she daisiest gal I ever saw! She is--well, daisy, is, 'n' mistake!” Everybody looked passed, every one looked little Lord Fauntleroy. And sun shone flags fluttered games played dances danced, gayeties went joyous afternoon passed, little lordship simply radiantly happy. The whole world seemed beautiful him. There one else happy, too,--an old man, who, though rich noble life, often honestly happy. Perhaps, indeed, I shall tell I think rather better rather happier. He not, indeed, suddenly become good Fauntleroy thought him; but, least, begun love something, several times found sort pleasure kind things innocent, kind little heart child suggested,--and beginning. And every day pleased son's wife. It true, people said, beginning like too. He liked hear sweet voice see sweet face; sat arm-chair, used watch listen talked boy; heard loving, gentle words new him, began see little fellow lived New York side street known grocery-men made friends boot-blacks, still well-bred manly little fellow made one ashamed him, even fortune changed heir English earldom, living English castle. It really simple thing, all,--it lived near kind gentle heart, taught think kind thoughts always care others. It little thing, perhaps, best thing all. He knew nothing earls castles; quite ignorant grand splendid things; always lovable simple loving. To like born king. As old Earl Dorincourt looked day, moving park among people, talking knew making ready little bow one greeted him, entertaining friends Dick Mr. Hobbs, standing near mother Miss Herbert listening conversation, old nobleman well satisfied him. And never better satisfied went biggest tent, important tenants Dorincourt estate sitting grand collation day. They drinking toasts; and, drunk health Earl, much enthusiasm name ever greeted before, proposed health “Little Lord Fauntleroy.” And ever doubt whether lordship popular not, would settled instant. Such clamor voices, rattle glasses applause! They begun like much, warm-hearted people, forgot feel restraint ladies gentlemen castle, come see them. They made quite decent uproar, one two motherly women looked tenderly little fellow stood, mother one side Earl other, grew quite moist eyes, said one another: “God bless him, pretty little dear!” Little Lord Fauntleroy delighted. He stood smiled, made bows, flushed rosy red pleasure roots bright hair. “Is like me, Dearest?” said mother. “Is it, Dearest? I glad!” And Earl put hand child's shoulder said him: “Fauntleroy, say thank kindness.” Fauntleroy gave glance mother. “Must I?” asked trifle shyly, smiled, Miss Herbert, nodded. And made little step forward, everybody looked him--such beautiful, innocent little fellow was, too, brave, trustful face!--and spoke loudly could, childish voice ringing quite clear strong. “I ever much obliged you!” said, “and--I hope enjoy birthday--because I enjoyed much--and--I glad I going earl; I think first I like it, I do--and I love place so, I think beautiful--and--and--and I earl, I going try good grandfather.” And amid shouts clamor applause, stepped back little sigh relief, put hand Earl's stood close him, smiling leaning side. And would end story; I must add one curious piece information, Mr. Hobbs became fascinated high life reluctant leave young friend actually sold corner store New York, settled English village Erlesboro, opened shop patronized Castle consequently great success. And though Earl never became intimate, believe me, man Hobbs became time aristocratic lordship himself, read Court news every morning, followed doings House Lords! And ten years after, Dick, finished education going visit brother California, asked good grocer wish return America, shook head seriously. “Not live there,” said. “Not live there; I want near HIM, an' sort look him. It good enough country young an' stirrin'--but faults it. There auntsister among them--nor earl!”
