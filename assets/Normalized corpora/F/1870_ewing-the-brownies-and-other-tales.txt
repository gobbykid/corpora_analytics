 THE BROWNIES AND OTHER TALES. THE BROWNIES. A little girl sat sewing crying garden seat. She fair floating hair, breeze blew her eyes, cloud hair, mist tears, she could see her work clearly. She neither tied her locks, dried her eyes, however; one miserable, one may well completely so. "What matter?" said Doctor, friend Rector's, came garden whenever he pleased. The Doctor tall stout man, hair black crow's feathers top, grey underneath, bushy beard. When young, he slim handsome, wonderful eyes, wonderful still; many years past. He great love children, one particular friend his. "What matter?" said he. "I am row," murmured young lady her veil; needle went damp, came jerk, apt result ladies called "puckering." "You like London yellow fog," said Doctor, throwing grass, "and depressing feelings. What row about, came get it?" "We are it," reply; apparently fog thickening, voice grew less less distinct--"the boys everybody. It is forgetting, putting away, leaving about, borrowing, breaking, sort thing. I have Father's new pocket-handkerchiefs hem, I have climbing boys, kept forgetting forgetting, Mother says I always forget; I cannot help it. I forget tidy his newspapers him, I forget feed Puss, I forgot these; besides, they are great bore, Mother gave Nurse do, one lost, found morning tossing toy-cupboard." "It looks taking violent exercise," said Doctor. "But boys it?" "Why, regular turn toys," she explained, "and they are regular mess. You know, always go till last minute, things get crammed anyhow. Mary I tidy twice; boys never put anything away, know, what is good?" "What, indeed!" said Doctor. "And complained them?" "Oh! no!" answered she. "We do not get rows, unless provoking; things theirs, everybody sent for, I sent finish this, tidying. I do not know done, I side hem; soldiers' box broken, Noah lost Noah's Ark, one elephants guinea-pig, rocking-horse's nose; nobody knows become Rutlandshire Wash, they are small, I do not wonder; North America Europe gone too." The Doctor started affected horror. "Europe gone, say? Bless me! become us!" "Do not!" said young lady, kicking petulantly her dangling feet, trying laugh. "You know I mean puzzles; yours, would not like it." "I do not half like is," said Doctor. "I seriously alarmed. An earthquake one thing; good shaking, settle again. But Europe gone--lost--Why, comes Deordie, I declare, looking much cheerful do; let us humbly hope Europe found. At present I feel like Aladdin his palace transported magician; I do not know I am." "You are here, Doctor; are not you?" asked slow curly-wigged brother, squatting grass. "_Is_ Europe found?" said Doctor tragically. "Yes," laughed Deordie. "I found it." "You great man," said Doctor. "And--it common charity ask--how North America?" "Found too," said Deordie. "But Wash completely lost." "And six shirts it!" said Doctor. "I sent last Saturday ever was. What world live in! Any news? Poor Tiny crying her eyes out." "I am sorry, Tiny," said brother. "But do not bother it. It is square now, we are going new shelf put up." "Have found everything?" asked Tiny. "Well, Wash, know. And elephant guinea-pig gone good; elephant guinea-pig must walk together pair now. Noah among soldiers, put cavalry night-light box. Europe North America behind book-case; and, would believe it? rocking-horse's nose turned nursery oven." "I cannot believe it," said Doctor. "The rocking-horse's nose could not turn up, purest Grecian, modelled Elgin marbles. Perhaps heat it, though. However, seem got troubles well, Master Deordie. I wish poor Tiny end her task." "So I," said Deordie ruefully. "But I tell I have thinking, Doctor. Nurse always nagging us, we are always rows one sort another, this, that, leaving things about. But, know, it is horrid shame, plenty servants, I do not see always bothering little things, and--" "Oh! come point, please," said Doctor; "you go round square so, telling stories, Deordie. What thinking of?" "Well," said Deordie, good-tempered he slow, "the day Nurse shut back nursery borrowing her scissors losing them; I would got 'Grimm' inside one knickerbockers, she locked door, I sat read. And I read story Shoemaker little Elves came his work he got up; I thought would jolly little Elves things instead us." "That is Tommy Trout said," observed Doctor. "Who is Tommy Trout?" asked Deordie. "Do not know, Deor?" said Tiny. "It is good boy pulled cat what is-his-name. 'Who pulled her out? Little Tommy Trout.' Is Tommy Trout, Doctor? I never heard anything else except his pulling cat out; I cannot think he that." "Let bucket her, course," said Doctor. "But listen me. If get handkerchief done, take mother kiss, keep waiting, I will tea, tell story Tommy Trout." "This night?" shouted Deordie. "This night." "Every one us?" inquired young gentleman rapturous incredulity. "Every one you.--Now, Tiny, work?" "It is done," said Tiny.--"Oh! Deordie, climb behind, hold back hair, there is darling, I fasten off. Oh! Deor, you are pulling hair out. Do not." "I want make pig-tail," said Deor. "You cannot," said Tiny, feminine contempt. "You cannot plait. What is good asking boys anything? There! it is done last. Now go ask Mother may go.--Will let come, Doctor," she inquired, "if I said?" "To sure I will," he answered. "Let look you. Your eyes swollen crying. How silly little goose?" "Did never cry?" asked Tiny. "When I age? Well, perhaps so." "You have never cried since, surely," said Tiny. The Doctor absolutely blushed. "What think?" said he. "Oh, course not," she answered. "You have nothing cry about. You are grown up, live alone beautiful house, like, never get rows, anybody think about; nasty pocket-handkerchiefs hem." "Very nice; eh, Deordie?" said Doctor. "Awfully jolly," said Deordie. "Nothing else wish for, eh?" "_I_ keep harriers, poodle, I man," said Deordie; "but I suppose could, wanted to." "Nothing cry about, rate?" "I think not!" said Deordie.--"There is Mother, though; let us go ask her tea;" ran. The Doctor stretched his six feet length upon sward, dropped his grey head little heap newly-mown grass, looked sky. "Awfully jolly--no nasty pocket-handkerchiefs hem," said he, laughing himself. "Nothing else wish for; nothing cry about." Nevertheless, he lay still, staring sky, till smile died away, tears came his eyes. Fortunately, one see. What could "awfully jolly" Doctor thinking make cry? He thinking grave-stone churchyard close by, story connected grave-stone known everybody place old enough remember it. This story nothing present story, ought told. And yet Doctor, short, shall put in, all. THE STORY OF A GRAVE-STONE. One early spring morning, twenty years before, man going his work sunrise churchyard, stopped flat stone he lately helped lay down. The day before, name cut it, he stayed read; name one scrawled words pencil, he read also--_Pitifully behold sorrows hearts_. On stone lay pencil, feet lay Doctor, face downwards, he lain night, hoar frost his black hair. Ah! grave-stones (they ugly things days; light, hopeful, pretty crosses set now), seem remorselessly imprison keep dear dead friends away us! And yet lie feather's weight upon souls gone, GOD knows heavily press upon souls left behind. Did spirit whose body dead, stand morning body whose spirit dead, pity him? Let us talk know. After said Doctor got fever, dying, he got better it; he his mind, he got better that, came looking much usual, except his hair never seemed quite black again, little night's hoar frost still remained. And misfortune happened I ever heard of; time went he grew beard, got stout, kept German poodle, gave tea-parties people's children. As grave-stone story, whatever end twenty years, great convenience his friends; he said anything did not agree with, anything could not understand, did not say expected him, could easier conclusive shake one's head say, "The fact is, Doctor little odd, _ever since_--!" THE DOCTOR'S TEA-PARTY. There one great advantage attendant upon invitations tea doctor. No objections raised score health. It obvious must fine enough go Doctor asks you, his tea-cakes may eaten perfect impunity. Those tea-cakes always good; to-night utterly delicious; perfect _abandon_ currants, amount citron peel enervating behold. Then housekeeper waited awful splendour, yet Doctor's authority her seemed absolute he Eastern despot. Deordie must excused believing charms living alone. It certainly advantages. The limited sphere duty conduces discipline household, demand exceed supply article waiting, general scrimmage conflicting interests besets large family favoured circumstances. The housekeeper waits black silk, looks she meaner occupation sit rocking-chair, dream damson cheese. Rustling, hospitable, subservient, one retired last, and-- "Now," said Doctor, "for verandah; look moon." The company adjourned rush, rear brought poodle, seemed quite used proceedings; verandah, framed passion-flowers geraniums, Doctor gathered mats, rugs, cushions, arm-chairs, party; far sky, yellow-faced harvest moon looked awful benignity. "Now!" said Doctor. "Take seats. Ladies first, gentlemen afterwards. Mary Tiny, race American rocking-chair. Well done! Of course hold both. Now, boys, shake down. No one sit stone, put his feet grass: you are ready, I will begin." "We are ready," said girls. The boys shook minutes more, Doctor began story "THE BROWNIES." "Bairns burden," said Tailor he sat work. He lived village glorious moors north England; bairns he meant children, every Northman knows. "Bairns burden," he sighed. "Bairns blessing," said old lady window. "It family motto. The Trouts large families good luck generations; is, till grandfather's time. He one son. I married him. He good husband, he spoilt child. He always used waited upon, he could not fash look farm his own. We six children. They dead you, youngest. You bound tailor. When farm came hands, wife died, never looked since. The land sold now, house. No! no! you are right enough there; you have troubles, son Thomas, lads _are_ idle!" It Tailor's mother spoke. She old woman, helpless. She quite bright her intellect she been, got muddled things lately happened; she clear memory long past, pertinacious her opinions. She knew private history almost every family place, Trouts buried old stones churchyard; tales ghosts, doubles, warnings, fairies, witches, hobgoblins, like, even her grandchildren ever come end of. Her hands trembled age, she regretted nothing danger brought her spilling salt. She past housework, day she sat knitting hearth-rugs bits scraps cloth shred tailoring. How far she believed wonderful tales she told, odd little charms she practised, one exactly knew; older she grew, stranger things she remembered, testy she one doubted truth. "Bairns blessing!" said she. "It family motto." "_Are they_?" said Tailor emphatically. He high respect his mother, like contradict her, he held his opinion, based upon personal experience; metaphysician, understand safer found opinions principles experience, since experience may alter, principles cannot. "Look Tommy," he broke suddenly. "That boy nothing whittle sticks morning till night. I almost lug bed mornings. If I send errand, he loiters; I would better gone myself. If I set anything, I tell everything; I could sooner myself. And he work, it is done unwillingly, poor grace; better, far better, myself. What housework boys ever looking baby? And afternoon she asleep cradle, went, she awoke, _I_ must leave work take her. _I_ gave her her supper, put her bed. And want I get, take play lose, bring play leave about, bairns give trouble, Mother, I have easy life it. The pay poor enough one get work, work hard enough one clear day in; housekeeping bairn-minding do not leave man much time his trade. No! no! Madam, luck Trouts gone, 'Bairns burden,' motto now. Though one's own," he muttered himself, "and bad ones, I hope would blessing." "There is Johnnie," murmured old lady, dreamily. "He face like apple." "And useful," said Tailor. "He might different, his brother leads nose." His brother led Tailor spoke, literally his snub, though, hand. They handsome pair, lazy couple. Johnnie especially largest roundest foreheads, reddest cheeks, brightest eyes, quaintest twitchy chins, looked altogether like gutta-percha cherub chronic state longitudinal squeeze. They locked together two grubby paws, armful moss, deposited floor came in. "I have swept floor to-day," said father, "and I am going again. Put rubbish outside." "Move it, Johnnie!" said his brother, seating stool, taking his knife piece wood, he cut sliced; apple-cheeked Johnnie stumbled stamped moss, scraped doorstep, leaving long trails earth behind him, sat also. "And chips same," added Tailor; "I _not_ clear litter lads make." "Pick  them up, Johnnie," said Thomas Trout, junior, exasperated sigh; apple tumbled up, rolled flying chips, tumbled again. "Is supper, Father?" asked Tommy. "No, not, Sir, unless know get it," said Tailor; taking his pipe, he went house. "Is really nothing eat, Granny?" asked boy. "No, bairn, bread breakfast to-morrow." "What makes Father cross, Granny?" "He is wearied, do not help him, dear." "What could I do, Grandmother?" "Many little things, tried," said old lady. "He spent half-an-hour to-day, moor, getting turf fire, could got well, he his work." "He never told me," said Tommy. "You might help bit now, would, laddie," said old lady coaxingly; "these bits cloth want tearing lengths, get  them ready, I go knitting. There will food mat done sold." "I will try," said Tommy, lounging desperate resignation. "Hold knife, Johnnie. Father's cross, everything miserable, ever since farm sold. I wish I big man, could make fortune.--Will do, Granny?" The old lady put her knitting looked. "My dear, that is short. Bless me! I gave lad piece measure by." "I thought length. Oh, dear! I tired;" he propped old lady's chair. "My dear! do not lean so; you will tipple over!" she shrieked. "I beg pardon, Grandmother. Will _that_ do?" "It is much long." "Tear bit off. Now it is right." "But, dear, wastes it. Now bit use. There goes knitting, awkward lad!" "Johnnie, pick up!--Oh! Grandmother, I _am_ hungry." The boy's eyes filled tears, old lady melted instant. "What I you, poor bairns?" said she. "There, never mind scraps, Tommy." "Tell us tale, Granny. If told us new one, I should not keep thinking bread cupboard.--Come, Johnnie, sit me. Now then!" "I doubt there is one old-world cracks I have not told you," said old lady, "unless it is queer ghost story told years ago house hollow blocked-up windows." "Oh! ghosts!" Tommy broke in; "we have many. I know rattling, scratching, knocking, figure white; turns tombstone white petticoat, I hate it." "It nothing sort tombstone," said old lady dignity. "It is good half-mile churchyard. And white petticoats, was not female house; he would not one; his victuals came pantry window. But never mind! Though it is true sermon." Johnnie lifted his head his brother's knee. "Let Granny tell she likes, Tommy. It is new ghost, I like know he was, his victuals came window." "I do not like story victuals," sulked Tommy. "It makes think bread. O Granny dear! tell us fairy story. You never tell us Fairies, I know know." "Hush! hush!" said old lady. "There is Miss Surbiton's Love-letter, her Dreadful End." "I know Miss Surbiton, Granny. I think she goose. Why do not tell us Fairies?" "Hush! hush! dear. There is Clerk Corpse-candles." "I know Corpse-candles, Granny. Besides, make Johnnie dream, he wakes keep company. _Why_ will not tell us Fairies?" "My dear, do not like it," said old lady. "O Granny dear, do not they? Do tell! I should not think bread bit, told us Fairies. I know nothing them." "He lived house long enough," said old lady. "But it is lucky name him." "O Granny, hungry miserable, matter?" "Well, that is true enough," she sighed. "Trout's luck gone; went Brownie, I believe." "Was _he_, Granny?" "Yes, dear, he lived Trouts several generations." "What he like, Granny?" "Like little man, say, dear." "What he do?" "He came family up, swept hearth, lighted fire, set breakfast, tidied room, sorts house-work. But he never would seen, could catch him. But could hear laughing playing house sometimes." "What darling! Did give wages, Granny?" "No! dear. He love. They set pancheon clear water night, bowl bread-and-milk, cream. He liked that, he dainty. Sometimes he left bit money water. Sometimes he weeded garden, threshed corn. He saved endless trouble, men maids." "O Granny! he go?" "The maids caught sight one night, dear, his coat ragged, got new suit, linen shirt him, laid bread-and-milk bowl. But Brownie saw things, he put on, dancing round kitchen, sang, 'What here? Hemten hamten! Here I never tread stampen,' danced door, never came back again." "O Grandmother! But not? Did not he like new clothes?" "The Old Owl knows, dear; I do not." "Who is Old Owl, Granny?" "I do not exactly know, dear. It is mother used say asked anything puzzled her. It said Old Owl Nanny Besom (a witch, dear!), took shape bird, could not change her voice, that is owl sits silent day fear she betray herself speaking, singing voice like birds. Many people used go consult Old Owl moon-rise, young days." "Did ever go, Granny?" "Once, nearly, dear." "Oh! tell us, Granny dear.--There Corpse-candles, Johnnie; it is moonlight," he added consolingly, Johnnie crept closer his knee, pricked his little red ears. "It grandfather courting me, dears," said old lady, "and I could not quite make mind. So I went mother, said, 'He is one side, he is other, on. Shall I say yes no?' And mother said, 'The Old Owl knows;' she fairly puzzled. So says I, 'I will go ask her to-night, sure moon rises.' "So moon-rise I went, white light gate stood grandfather. 'What time night?' says I. 'Watching window,' says he. 'What _you_ time night?' 'The Old Owl knows,' said I, burst crying." "What for?" said Johnnie. "I cannot rightly tell you, dear," said old lady, "but gave turn see him. And without ado grandfather kissed me. 'How dare you?' said I. 'What mean?' 'The Old Owl knows,' said he. So never went." "How stupid!" said Tommy. "Tell us Brownie, please," said Johnnie, "Did he ever live anybody else?" "There plenty Brownies," said old lady, "or used mother's young days. Some houses several." "Oh! I wish would come back!" cried boys chorus. "He would-- "tidy room," said Johnnie; "fetch turf," said Tommy; "pick chips," said Johnnie; "sort scraps," said Tommy; "and everything. Oh! I wish he had not gone away." "What is that?" said Tailor, coming moment. "It is Brownie, Father," said Tommy. "We sorry he went, wish one." "What nonsense telling them, Mother?" asked Tailor. "Heighty teighty," said old lady, bristling. "Nonsense, indeed! As good men you, son Thomas, would soon jumped crags, spoken lightly _them_, mother's young days." "Well, well," said Tailor, "I beg pardon. They never aught me, whatever forbears; they are welcome old place ever, choose come. There is plenty do." "Would mind setting pan water, Father?" asked Tommy gently. "There is bread-and-milk." "You may set like, lad," said Tailor; "and I wish bread-and-milk sakes, bairns. You it, I got it. But go bed now." They lugged pancheon, filled dexterity usual, went bed, leaving knife one corner, wood another, splashes water track. There room comfort ruined old farm-house, two boys slept bed cut heather, old malt-loft. Johnnie soon land dreams, growing rosier rosier he slept, tumbled apple among grey heather. But lazy Tommy. The idea domesticated Brownie taken full possession his mind; whither Brownie gone, he might found, would induce return, mysteries he longed solve. "There is owl living old she would mere," he thought. "It may Old Owl herself, she knows, Granny says. When Father's gone bed, moon rises, I will go." Meanwhile he lay down. * * * * * The moon rose like gold, went heavens like silver, flooding moors pale ghostly light, taking colour heather, painting black shadows stone walls. Tommy opened his eyes, ran window. "The moon risen," said he, crept softly ladder, kitchen, pan water, Brownie, moor. The air fresh, say chilly; glorious night, though everything wind Tommy seemed asleep. The stones, walls, gleaming lanes, intensely still; church tower valley seemed awake watching, silent; houses village round eyes shut, is, window-blinds down; seemed Tommy moors drawn white sheets them, lay sleeping also. "Hoot! hoot!" said voice fir plantation behind him. Somebody else awake, then. "It is Old Owl," said Tommy; she came, swinging heavily across moor flapping stately flight, sailed she would mere. The old lady moved faster she seemed do, though Tommy ran hard she she would time him. When he got in, bird seen, he heard crunching sound above, looking up, sat Old Owl, pecking tearing munching shapeless black object, blinking him--Tommy--with yellow eyes. "Oh dear!" said Tommy, he did not much like it. The Old Owl dropped black mass floor; Tommy care somehow examine it. "Come up! come up!" said she hoarsely. She could speak, then! Beyond doubt _the_ Old Owl, none other. Tommy shuddered. "Come here! come here!" said Old Owl. The Old Owl sat beam ran across she would. Tommy often climbed fun; he climbed now, sat face face her, thought her eyes looked made flame. "Kiss fluffy face," said Owl. Her eyes going round like flaming catherine wheels, certain requests one option refusing. Tommy crept nearer, put his lips round face eyes shone. Oh! downy warm, soft, indescribably soft. Tommy's lips sank it, could not get bottom. It unfathomable feathers fluffiness. "Now, want?" said Owl. "Please," said Tommy, felt rather re-assured, "can tell find Brownies, get one come live us?" "Oohoo!" said Owl, "that is it, it? I know three Brownies." "Hurrah!" said Tommy. "Where live?" "In house," said Owl. Tommy aghast. "In house!" he exclaimed. "Whereabouts? Let rummage out. Why nothing?" "One young," said Owl. "But do not others work?" asked Tommy. "They idle, idle," said Old Owl, she gave herself shake she said it, fluff went flying she would, Tommy nearly tumbled beam his fright. "Then do not want them," said he. "What use Brownies nothing help us?" "Perhaps do not know how, one told them," said Owl. "I wish would tell find them," said Tommy; "I could tell them." "Could you?" said Owl. "Oohoo! oohoo!" Tommy could not tell whether she hooting laughing. "Of course I could," he said. "They might sweep house, light fire, spread table, sort thing, Father came down. Besides, could _see_ wanted. The Brownies Granny's mother's young days. And could tidy room, fetch turf, pick chips, sort Granny's scraps. Oh! there is lots do." "So is," said Owl. "Oohoo! Well, I tell find one Brownies; find him, he tell his brother is. But depends upon whether feel equal undertaking it, whether follow directions." "I quite ready go," said Tommy, "and I shall tell me. I feel sure I could persuade them. If knew every one would love made useful!" "Oohoo! oohoo!" said Owl. "Now pay attention. You must go north side mere moon shining--('I know Brownies like water,' muttered Tommy)--and turn round three times, saying charm: 'Twist me, turn me, show Elf-- I looked water, saw--' When got far, look water, moment see Brownie, think word fill couplet, rhyme first line. If either see Brownie, fail think word, use." "Is Brownie merman," said Tommy, wriggling along beam, "that he lives water?" "That depends whether he fish's tail," said Owl, "and discover yourself." "Well, moon shining, I shall go," said Tommy. "Good-bye, thank you, Madam;" he jumped went, saying he ran, "I believe he merman same, else could he live mere? I know Brownies Granny does, I shall tell her so;" Tommy somewhat opinionated, like young people. The moon shone brightly centre mere. Tommy knew place well, fine echo there. Round edge grew rushes water plants, cast border shadow. Tommy went north side, turning three times, Old Owl told him, he repeated charm-- "Twist me, turn me, show Elf-- I looked water, saw--" Now it! He looked in, saw--the reflection his face. "Why, there is one myself!" said Tommy. "And word be? I must done wrong." "Wrong!" said Echo. Tommy almost surprised find echo awake time night. "Hold tongue!" said he. "Matters provoking enough themselves. Belf! Celf! Delf! Felf! Gelf! Helf! Jelf! What rubbish! There cannot word fit it. And look Brownie, see nothing myself!" "Myself," said Echo. "Will quiet?" said Tommy. "If would tell one word would sense interference; roar 'Myself!' one, neither rhymes runs--it rhyme though, happens," he added; "and odd! runs too-- 'Twist me, turn me, show Elf-- I looked water, saw myself,' I certainly did. What mean? The Old Owl knows, Granny would say; I shall go back ask her." "Ask her!" said Echo. "Did not I say I should?" said Tommy. "How exasperating are! It strange. _Myself_ certainly rhyme, I wonder I think long ago." "Go," said Echo. "Will mind business, go sleep?" said Tommy. "I going; I said I should." And back he went. There sat Old Owl before. "Oohoo!" said she, Tommy climbed up. "What see mere?" "I saw nothing myself," said Tommy indignantly. "And expect see?" asked Owl. "I expected see Brownie," said Tommy; "you told so." "And Brownies like, pray?" inquired Owl. "The one Granny knew useful little fellow, something like little man," said Tommy. "Ah!" said Owl, "but know present one idle little fellow, something like little man. Oohoo! oohoo! Are quite sure did not see him?" "Quite," answered Tommy sharply. "I saw one myself." "Hoot! toot! How touchy are! And you, pray?" "I am Brownie," said Tommy. "Do not sure," said Owl. "Did find word?" "No," said Tommy. "I could find word meaning would rhyme 'myself.'" "Well, runs rhymes," said Owl. "What want? Where is brother now?" "In bed malt-loft," said Tommy. "Then questions answered," said Owl, "and know wants doing, go it. Good-night, rather good-morning, long past midnight;" old lady began shake her feathers start. "Do not go yet, please," said Tommy humbly. "I do not understand it. You know I am Brownie, I?" "Yes, are," said Owl, "and idle one too. All children Brownies." "But I could not work like Brownie," said Tommy. "Why not?" inquired Owl. "Could not sweep floor, light fire, spread table, tidy room, fetch turf, pick chips, sort grandmother's scraps? You know 'there is lots do.'" "But I do not think I like it," said Tommy. "I would much rather Brownie me." "And would meanwhile?" asked Owl. "Be idle, I suppose; suppose use man's children nothing help him? Ah! knew every one would love made useful!" "But really truly so?" asked Tommy, dismal voice. "Are Brownies children?" "No, not," said Owl. "And pray think Brownies, whoever may be, come house save trouble idle healthy little boys live it? Listen me, Tommy," said old lady, her eyes shooting rays fire dark corner she sat. "Listen me, clever boy, understand one speaks; I tell whole history Brownies, handed family grandmother's great-grandmother, lived Druid's Oak, intimate fairies. And I done shall tell think are, children. It is opinion I come rate, I do not think wisdom died great-grandmothers." "I like hear please," said Tommy. The Old Owl shook tuft two fluff, set her eyes a-going began: "The Brownies, or, sometimes called, Small Folk, Little People, Good People, race tiny beings domesticate house grown-up human pays rent taxes. They like small editions men women, small fragile heavy work; strength man, thousand times fresh nimble. They run jump, roll tumble, marvellous agility endurance, many aches pains men women groan under, even know names. They trade profession, live entirely upon people, know nothing domestic cares; fact, know little upon subject, though often intelligent highly inquisitive. They love dainties, play, mischief. They apt greatly beloved, capriciously affectionate. They little people, little things. When idle mischievous, called Boggarts, curse house live in. When useful considerate, Brownies, much-coveted blessing. Sometimes Blessed Brownies take abode worthy couple, cheer romps merry laughter, tidy house, find things lost, take little troubles hands full great anxieties. Then time Little People Brownies longer. They grow men women. They care much dainties, play, mischief. They cease jump tumble, roll house. They know more, laugh less. Then, heads begin ache anxiety, labour living, great cares life come on, Brownies come live them, take little cares, supply little comforts, make house merry more." "How nice!" said Tommy. "Very nice," said Old Owl. "But what"--and she shook herself fiercely ever, glared Tommy expected nothing less her eyes would set fire her feathers she would burnt alive. "But must I say Boggarts? Those idle urchins eat bread-and-milk, do not work, lie bed without ache pain excuse them, untidy instead tidying, work instead it, leave little cares heap big cares, till old people support worn altogether." "Do not!" said Tommy. "I cannot bear it." "I hope Boggarts grow men," said Old Owl, "that children Boggarts too, they will know is!" "Do not!" roared Tommy. "I will not Boggart. I will Brownie." "That is right," nodded Old Owl. "I said boy could understand one spoke. And remember Brownies never seen work. They get household, get away one see them. I cannot tell why. I do not think grandmother's great-grandmother knew. Perhaps good deeds better done secret." "Please," said Tommy, "I like go home now, tell Johnnie. It is getting cold, I tired!" "Very true," said Old Owl, "and early to-morrow. I think I better take home." "I know way, thank you," said Tommy. "I did not say _show_ way, I said _take_ you--carry you," said Owl. "Lean me." "I would rather not, thank you," said Tommy. "Lean me," screamed Owl. "Oohoo! obstinate boys sure!" Tommy crept unwillingly. "Lean full weight, shut eyes," said Owl. Tommy laid his head Old Owl's feathers, vague idea she smelt heather, thought must living moor, shut his eyes, leant his full weight, expecting he Owl would certainly fall beam together. Down--feathers--fluff--he sank sank, could feel nothing solid, jumped start save himself, opened his eyes, found he sitting among heather malt-loft, Johnnie sleeping his side. "How quickly came!" said he; "that certainly clever Old Owl. I could not counted ten whilst eyes shut. How odd!" But odder still was, longer moonlight, early dawn. "Get up, Johnnie," said his brother, "I have got story tell you." And Johnnie sat up, rubbed his eyes open, he related his adventures moor. "Is true?" said Johnnie. "I mean, really happen?" "Of course did," said his brother; "do not believe it?" "Oh yes," said Johnnie. "But I thought perhaps true story, like Granny's true stories. I believe those, know. But there, know, different--" "I there," said Tommy, "and it is I tell you: I tell what, mean anything must get up: though, oh dear! I like stay bed. I say," he added, pause, "suppose do. It cannot matter Boggarts one night more. I mean Brownie I grow up, though. I could not stand boggarty children." "I will not Boggart all," said Johnnie, "it is horrid. But I do not see Brownies, I am afraid cannot things. I wish I bigger!" "I well enough," said Tommy, following his brother's example getting up. "Do not suppose I light fire? Think bonfires made! And I do not think I mind regular good tidy-up either. It is stupid putting-away-things-when-you have-done-with-them I hate so!" The Brownies crept softly ladder kitchen. There blank hearth, dirty floor, odds ends lying about, looking cheerless enough dim light. Tommy felt quite important he looked round. There cure untidiness clearing people; one sees clearly fault lies. "Look door-step, Johnnie," said Brownie-elect, "what mess made it! If lifted moss carefully, instead stamping struggling it, would saved us ten minutes' work morning." This wisdom could gainsaid, Johnnie looked meek rueful. "I going light fire," pursued his brother;--"the next turfs, know, _we_ must get--you tidy bit. Look knife I gave hold last night, wood--that is fault though, scraps Granny's chair. What grubbing rat-hole for?" Johnnie raised his head somewhat flushed tumbled. "What think I found?" said he triumphantly. "Father's measure lost week!" "Hurrah!" said Tommy, "put his things. That is sort thing Brownie done. What he say? And I say, Johnnie, you have tidied, go grub potato two garden, I will put roast breakfast. I am lighting bonfire!" The fire successful. Johnnie went potatoes, Tommy cleaned door-step, swept room, dusted chairs old chest, set table. There doubt he could handy he chose. "I will tell I have thought of, time," said Johnnie, he washed potatoes water set Brownie. "We might run South Pasture mushrooms. Father said reason found people go sunrise take market. The sun's rising, sure find some, would breakfast." "There is plenty time," said Tommy; went. The dew lay heavy thick upon grass road-side, miles network spiders woven blossom blossom heather. The dew Sun's breakfast; he barely yet, eaten it, world felt anything warm. Nevertheless, sweet fresh later hour day, every sound like returning voice long-absent friend. Down pastures, network dew, one nothing speak way boots, state ground less consequence. The Tailor right, lack mushrooms time morning. All pasture stood, sizes, like buttons, like tables; distance one two ragged women, stooping baskets, looked like huge fungi also. "This fairies feast," said Tommy. "They large party last night. When go, take away dishes cups, made gold; leave tables, eat them." "I wonder whether giants would like eat tables," said Johnnie. This beyond Tommy's capabilities surmise; filled handkerchief, hurried back again, fear Tailor come down-stairs. They depositing last mushroom dish table, his footsteps heard descending. "There he is!" exclaimed Tommy. "Remember, must not caught. Run back bed." Johnnie caught handkerchief, smothering laughter, two scrambled back ladder, dashed straight heather. Meanwhile poor Tailor came wearily down-stairs. Day day, since his wife's death, he come every morning desolate sight--yesterday's refuse empty hearth. This morning task tidying always sad ungrateful one widowed father. His awkward struggles house-work _she_ notable, chafed him. The dirty kitchen dreary, labour lonely, hour's time lost his trade. But life stand still one wishing, Tailor neither remedy substitute; came morning mornings pail broom. When he came he looked round, started, rubbed his eyes; looked round again, rubbed harder: went fire held his hand, (warm certainly)--then table smelt mushrooms, (esculent fungi beyond doubt)--handled loaf, stared open door window, swept floor, sunshine pouring in, finally sat stunned admiration. Then he jumped ran foot stairs, shouting, "Mother! mother! Trout's luck come again." "And yet, no!" he thought, "the old lady's asleep, it is shame wake her, I will tell idle rascally lads, they will pleased deserve. It Tommy set water caught him." "Boys! boys!" he shouted foot ladder, "the Brownie come!--and he has not found measure!" he added returning kitchen; "this good day's work me." There great excitement small household day. The boys kept counsel. The old Grandmother triumphant, tried seem surprised. The Tailor made vain effort, remained till bed-time state fresh unconcealed amazement. "I have often heard Good People," he broke towards end evening. "And I have heard folk say they have known seen capering round grey rocks moor midnight: wonderful! To come work pan cold water! Who could believed it?" "You might believed you would believed me, son Thomas," said old lady tossily. "I told so. But young people always know better elders!" "I did not see him," said Tailor, beginning his story afresh; "but I thought I came I heard sort laughing rustling." "My mother said often heard playing laughing house," said old lady. "I told so." "Well, he shall not want bowl bread-and-milk to-morrow, anyhow," said Tailor, "if I stick Farmer Swede's waistcoat till midnight." But waistcoat finished bed-time, Tailor set bread-and-milk-himself, went rest. "I say," said Tommy, boys bed, "the Old Owl right, must stick it. But I will tell I do not like, Father thinking we are idle still. I wish he knew Brownies." "So I," said Johnnie; he sighed. "I tell what," said Tommy, decisiveness elder brotherhood, "we will keep quiet bit fear leave off; we have gone good while, I shall tell him. It Old Owl's grandmother's great-grandmother said kept secret, Old Owl herself said grandmothers always right." "No are," said Johnnie; "look Granny this." "I know," said Tommy. "She is regular muddle." "So she is," said Johnnie. "But that is rather fun, I think." And went sleep. Day day went by, still Brownies "stuck it," work. It hard matter get early one young light-hearted, sleeps upon heather loft without window-blinds, many broken window-panes air comes freely in. In old times boys used play tents among heather, Tailor house-work; came him. Size everything, even material existence. One heard dwarfs quite clever (not say powerful) giants, I fancy Fairy Godmothers ever large. It wonderful comfort Brownies may house fortunate enough hold them! The Tailor's Brownies joy his life; day day seemed grow ingenious finding little things his good. Now-a-days Granny never picked scrap herself. One day's shearings neatly arranged next morning, laid her knitting-pins; Tailor's tape shears absent without leave. One day message came offer two three days' tailoring farm-house miles valley. This pleasant advantageous sort work; good food, sure pay, cheerful change; he know he could leave his family, unless, indeed, Brownie might relied upon "keep house together," say. The boys sure he would, promised set his water, give little trouble possible; so, finally, Tailor took his shears went valley, green banks sloped purple moor, broke sandy rocks, crowned nodding oak fern. On prosperous old farm, he spent pleasant time, sitting level window geraniums table set apart him, stitching gossiping, gossiping stitching, feeling secure honest payment his work done. The mistress house kind good creature, loved chat; though Tailor kept his secret Brownies, he felt rather curious know Good People hand comfort flourishing household, watched his opportunity make careless inquiries subject. "Brownies?" laughed dame. "Ay, Master, I heard them. When I girl, service old hall, Cowberry Edge, I heard good deal one said lived former times. He house-work well woman, good deal quicker, said. One night one young ladies (that then, they are dead now) hid herself cupboard, see he like." "And he like?" inquired Tailor, composedly he able. "A little fellow, said," answered Farmer's wife, knitting calmly on. "Like dwarf, know, largish head his body. Not taller than--why, Bill, eldest boy, perhaps. And he dressed rags, old cloak on, stamping passion cobweb he could not get his broom. They have uncertain tempers, say. Tears one minute, laughing next." "You never one here, I suppose?" said Tailor. "Not we," she answered; "and I think I would rather not. They are canny all; master always used work, we have sons daughters help us, that is better meddling Fairies, mind. No! no!" she added, laughing, "if one you would heard it, whoever did not, I decent clothes made him. I could not stand rags old cloaks, messing moth-catching, house." "They say it is lucky give clothes, though," said Tailor; "they do not like it." "Tell me!" said dame, "as one liked tidy room would not like tidy clothes, could get them. No! no! one, shall take his measure, I promise you." And Tailor got her subject. When his work finished, Farmer paid once; good dame added half cheese, bottle-green coat. "That laid small master he is stout," she said; "but except stain two it is good enough, cut like new one lads." The Tailor thanked them, said farewell, went home. Down valley, river, wandering green banks sandy rocks, caught giant mosses, bands fairy fern, choked struggled, last barely escaped existence, ran away diminished stream. On purple hills old ruined house. As he came gate he struck idea change, looking again, he saw garden weeded, comparatively tidy. The truth is, Tommy Johnnie taken advantage Tailor's absence Brownie's work daytime. "It is Blessed Brownie!" said Tailor. "Has he usual?" he asked, he house. "To sure," said old lady; "all well, son Thomas." "I will tell is," said Tailor, pause. "I am needy man, I hope I am ungrateful. I never repay Brownie he done mine; mistress yonder given bottle-green coat cut good new; sure there is Brownie house, I will make suit it." "You will _what_?" shrieked old lady. "Son Thomas, son Thomas, you are mad! Do please Brownies, never make clothes." "There is nothing want more," said Tailor, "by accounts. They are rags, well may be, much work." "If make clothes Brownie, he will go good," said Grandmother, voice awful warning. "Well, I do not know," said her son. "The mistress farm clever enough, I tell you; she said me, fancy one likes tidy room liking tidy coat!" For Tailor, like men, apt think well wisdom womankind houses. "Well, well," said old lady, "go way. I am old woman, time long. It does not matter much me. But new clothes drove Brownie before, Trout's luck went him." "I know, Mother," said Tailor, "and I have thinking way home; I tell was. Depend upon it, _the clothes did not fit_. But I will tell I mean do. I shall measure Tommy--they say Brownies his size--and ever I turned well-made coat waistcoat, shall his." "Please yourself," said old lady, she would say more. "I think you are quite right, Father," said Tommy, "and I can, I will help make them." Next day father son set work, Tommy contrived make useful, Tailor hardly knew he got much work. "It is like thing," he broke last, "to one bit helpful you; tailoring company's sake. I have done pleasant morning's work since poor mother died. I will tell is, Tommy," he added, "if always like this, I should not much care whether Brownie stayed went. I would give his help yours." "I will back directly," said Tommy, burst room search his brother. "I have come away," he said, squatting down, "because I cannot bear it. I nearly let out, I shall soon. I wish things were not going come me," he added, kicking stone front him. "I wish he would measured you, Johnnie." "I am glad he did not," said Johnnie. "I wish he would kept himself." "Bottle-green, brass buttons," murmured Tommy, therewith fell reverie. The next night suit finished, laid bread-and-milk. "We shall see," said old lady, withering tone. There much real prophetic wisdom truism, sounds awful, Tailor went bed somewhat depressed. Next morning Brownies came usual. "Do not look splendid?" said Tommy, feeling cloth. "When we have tidied place I shall put on." But long place tidy, he could wait longer, dressed up. "Look me!" he shouted; "bottle-green brass buttons! Oh, Johnnie, I wish some." "It is good thing two Brownies," said Johnnie, laughing, "and one rags still. I shall work morning." And he went flourishing round broom, Tommy jumped madly his new suit. "Hurrah!" he shouted, "I feel like Brownie. What Granny said he sang he got his clothes? Oh, I know-- 'What here? Hemten hamten! Here I never tread stampen.'" And he danced, regardless clouds dust raised Johnnie, he drove broom indiscriminately floor, tune his laughter. It laughter roused Tailor morning, laughter coming floor kitchen below. He scrambled his things stole down-stairs. "It is Brownie," he thought; "I must look, it is last time." At door he paused listened. The laughter mixed singing, he heard words-- "What here? Hemten hamten! Here I never tread stampen." He pushed in, sight met his eyes. The kitchen primeval condition chaos, untidy particulars less apparent, everything less obscured clouds dust, Johnnie reigned triumphant, like witch her broomstick; and, crown all, Tommy capering singing Brownie's bottle-green suit, brass buttons all. "What is this?" shouted astonished Tailor, he could find breath speak. "It is Brownies," sang boys; danced, worked state excitement easy settle down. "Where _is_ Brownie?" shouted father. "He is here," said Tommy; "we Brownies." "Cannot stop fooling?" cried Tailor, angrily. "This past joke. Where real Brownie, I say?" "We Brownies, really, Father," said Tommy, coming full stop, feeling strongly tempted run laughing crying. "Ask Old Owl. It is true, really." The Tailor saw boy earnest, passed his hand his forehead. "I suppose I am getting old," he said; "I cannot see daylight this. If Brownie, tidying kitchen lately?" "We have," said they. "But found measure?" "I did," said Johnnie. "And sorts grandmother's scraps?" "We do," said they. "And sets breakfast, puts things order?" "We do," said they. "But it?" asked Tailor. "Before come down," said they. "But I always call you," said Tailor. "We get back bed again," said boys. "But never before?" asked Tailor doubtfully. "We idle, idle," said Tommy. The Tailor's voice rose pitch desperation-- "But work," he shouted, "_where Brownie?_" "Here!" cried boys, "and sorry Boggarts long." With father sons fell other's arms fairly wept. * * * * * It believed explain Grandmother work moment. She understood last, however, Tailor could restrain little good-humoured triumph subject. Before he went work he settled her window her knitting, kissed her. "What think all, Mother?" he inquired. "Bairns blessing," said old lady tartly, "_I told so._" * * * * * "That is end, it?" asked one boys tone dismay, Doctor paused here. "Yes, is," said he. "But could not make little end?" asked Deordie, "to tell us became all?" "I do not see tell," said Doctor. "Why, there is whether ever saw Old Owl again, whether Tommy Johnnie went Brownies," said children. The Doctor laughed. "Well, quiet five minutes," he said. "We will quiet mice," said children. And quiet mice were. Very like mice, indeed. Very like mice behind wainscot night, thrown something frighten away. Death-like stillness seconds, rustling scuffling please. So children sat holding breath moment two, shuffling feet smothered bursts laughter testified impatience, difficulty understanding process story-making displayed Doctor, sat pulling his beard, staring his boots, he made "a little end." "Well," he said, sitting suddenly, "the Brownies went work spite bottle-green suit, Trout's luck returned old house more. Before long Tommy began work farmers, Baby grew Brownie, made (as girls apt make) best house-sprite all. For, Brownie's habits self-denial, thoughtfulness, consideration, art little kindnesses, boys are, I afraid, general rule, somewhat behindhand sisters. Whether altogether proceeds constitutional deficiency points masculine character, one result among many code bye-laws obtains men's moral education cradle, question everybody opinion. For present young gentlemen may appropriate whichever theory prefer, go back story. The Tailor lived see his boy-Brownies become men, cares prosperous farm hands, his girl-Brownie carry her fairy talents another home. For Brownies--young ladies!--are much desired wives, whereas man might well marry old witch young Boggartess." "And Owl?" clamoured children, rather resentful Doctor's pausing take breath. "Of course," he continued, "the Tailor heard whole story, anxious thank Old Owl her friendly offices, also rather curious see hear her, he went boys one night moon-rise she would mere. It earlier evening Tommy went, daylight vanished, first appearance moon, impatient Tailor place. There found Owl looking solemn stately beam. She sitting among shadows her shoulders up, she fixed her eyes steadily Tailor, he felt quite overpowered. He made her civil bow, however, said, "I am much obliged you, Madam, good advice Tommy." The Owl blinked sharply, she grudged shutting her eyes instant, stared on, word spoke she. "I do not mean intrude, Madam," said Tailor, "but I wishful pay respects gratitude." Still Owl gazed determined silence. "Do not remember me?" said Tommy pitifully. "I everything told me. Will not even say good-bye?" he went towards her. The Owl's eyes contracted, she shuddered tufts fluff she would, shook her wings, shouting "Oohoo!" top her voice, flew upon moor. The Tailor his sons rushed watch her. They could see her clearly green twilight sky, flapping rapidly away her round face pale moon. "Good-bye!" shouted she disappeared; first departing owl, shadowy body flapping sails, two wings beating measured time, two moving lines still old tune, stroke, fancy, then--the green sky pale moon, Old Owl gone. "Did she never come back?" asked Tiny subdued tones, Doctor paused again. "No," said he; "at least she would mere. Tommy saw many owls course his life; none would speak, addicted unconventional customs staring winking, he could distinguish his friend, she among them. And I think all." "Is end?" asked Tiny. "The end," said Doctor. "I suppose might ends," speculated Deordie--"about whether Brownies children grew farmers, whether children Brownies, whether _they_ Brownies, on." And Deordie rocked among geraniums, luxurious imagining endless fairy tale. "You insatiable rascal!" said Doctor. "Not another word. Jump up, I going see home. I early to-morrow." "Where?" said Deordie. "Never mind. I shall away day, I want home good time evening, I mean attack crop groundsel sweet-pea hedges. You know, Brownies come homestead!" And Doctor's mouth twitched little till he fixed stiff smile. The children tried hard extract ends way Rectory; he declined pursue history Trout family indefinite generations. It decided hands, however, Tommy Trout evidently one Tommy Trout pulled cat well, "it sort thing Brownie do, know!" Johnnie Green (who, course, Johnnie Trout) unworthy village acquaintance, "a thorough Boggart." "Doctor!" said Tiny, stood garden-gate, "how long think gentlemen's pocket-handkerchiefs take wear out?" "That, dear Madam," said Doctor, "must depend, like terrestrial matters, upon circumstances; whether gentleman bought fine cambric, coarse cotton pink portraits reigning Sovereign, commence with; whether he catches many colds, his pockets picked, takes snuff, allows his washerwoman use washing powders. But want know?" "I shall not tell that," said Tiny, spoilt Doctor, consequently tyrannized proportion; "but I tell I mean do. I mean tell Mother Father wants pocket-handkerchiefs hemmed, she better put bath nursery, perhaps Brownie come them." "Kiss fluffy face!" said Doctor sepulchral tones. "The owl high up," said Tiny, tossing her head. The Doctor lifted her four feet so, obtained his kiss, set her again. "You are fluffy all," said she tone utmost contempt; "you are tickly bristly. Puss fluffy, Father scrubby scratchy, he shaves." "And three styles prefer?" said Doctor. "Not tickly bristly," said Tiny firmness; she strutted walk space two, turned round laugh her shoulder. "Good-night!" shouted her victim, shaking his fist her. The children took noisy farewell, raced house give joint versions fairy tale, first parents drawing-room, Nurse nursery. The Doctor went home also, his poodle his heels, way he came. He went his way, odd; Doctor "a little odd," moreover always end his evening walk. Through church-yard, spreading cedars stiff yews rose velvet grass, among tombstones crosses various devices lay one older uglier date, he stayed. It framed border brilliant flowers, would seem Doctor must gardener, he picked dead ones, put absently his pocket. Then he looked round see he alone. Not soul seen, moonlight shadow lay quietly side side, dead graves. The Doctor stooped took his hat. "Good-night, Marcia," he said low quiet voice. "Good-night, darling!" The dog licked his hand, voice answer, regarded. Poor foolish Doctor! Most foolish speak departed his face earthwards. But weak mortals, best us; man (one best) raised his head last, went home like lonely owl his face moon sky. A BORROWED BROWNIE. "I cannot imagine," said Rector, walking drawing-room following afternoon; "I cannot imagine Tiny is. I want her drive end parish me." "There she comes," said his wife, looking window, "by garden-gate, great basket; she after?" The Rector went discover, met his daughter looking decidedly earthy, seemingly much exhausted weight basketful groundsel plants. "Where been?" said he. "In Doctor's garden," said Tiny triumphantly; "and look I done! I have weeded his sweet-peas, brought away groundsel; he gets home to-night he will think Brownie garden, Mrs. Pickles promised tell him." "But look here!" said Rector, affecting great appearance severity, "you are Brownie, his. Supposing Tommy Trout gone weeded Farmer Swede's garden, brought back his weeds go seed Tailor's flower-beds, think he would liked it?" Tiny looked rather crestfallen. When one fairly carried splendid benevolence kind, trying find oneself wrong. She crept Rector, however, put her golden head upon his arm. "But, Father dear," she pleaded, "I did not mean Brownie; only, know, got five left home, short time, Doctor has not Brownie all. Do not pity him?" And Rector, old enough remember grave-stone story wot of, hugged his Brownie his arms, answered, "My Darling, I pity him!" THE LAND OF LOST TOYS. AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE NURSERY. It certainly aggravated offence. It generally understood families "boys boys," limit forbearance implied extenuating axiom. Master Sam condemned back nursery rest day. He always knack breaking his toys,--he unfrequently broke people's; accidents happen, his twin-sister factotum, Dot, long-suffering. Dot fat, resolute, hasty, devotedly unselfish. When Sam scalped her new doll, fastened glossy black curls wigwam improvised curtains four-post bed best bedroom, Dot sorely tried. As her eyes passed crown-less doll floor floss-silk ringlets hanging bed-furniture, her round rosy face grew rounder rosier, tears burst her eyes. But moment she clenched her little fists, forced back tears, gave vent her favourite saying, "I do not care." That sentence Dot's bane antidote; her vice her virtue. It her standing consolation, brought her her scrapes. It her one panacea ups downs her life (and nursery Sam developed his organ destructiveness ups downs few); form her naughtiness took she naughty. "Do not care fell goose-pond, Miss Dot," said Nurse, one occasion kind. "I do not care he did," said Miss Dot; Nurse knew feature goose-pond adventure met view it, she closed subject putting Dot corner. In strength _Don't care_, her love Sam, Dot bore much long. Her dolls perished ingenious untimely deaths. Her toys put purposes never intended, suffered accordingly. But Sam penitent Dot heroic. Florinda's scalp mended hot knitting-needle perpetual bonnet, Dot rescued her paint-brushes glue-pot, smelt her india-rubber boiled Sam's waterproof manufactory, long-suffering forbearance. There are, however, said, limits everything. An earthquake celebrated whole contents toy cupboard borne. The matter this. Early one morning Sam announced he glorious project hand. He going give grand show entertainment, far surpassing nursery imitations circuses, conjurors, lectures chemistry, forth, ever amused themselves. He refused confide his plans faithful Dot; he begged her lend toys she possessed, return she sole spectator fun. He let idea suggested sight Diorama taken, he would allow anything kind; proof she liberty keep back her paint-box. Dot tried hard penetrate secret, reserve her things general conscription. But Sam obstinate. He would tell nothing, he wanted everything. The dolls, bricks (especially bricks), tea-things, German farm, Swiss cottages, animals, dolls' furniture. Dot gave doubtful mind, consoled herself she watched Sam carrying pieces board green table cover back nursery, prospect show. At last, Sam threw open door ushered her nursery rocking-chair. The boy certainly constructive well destructive talent. Upon sort impromptu table covered green cloth he arranged toys rough imitation town, streets buildings. The relative proportion parts certainly good; Sam's fault doll's house German farm, his brick buildings, Swiss cottages, totally different scales size. He ingeniously put larger things foreground, keeping small farm-buildings German box far end streets, yet perspective extreme. The effect three large horses toy stables front, cows small Noah's Ark distance, admirable; big dolls seated unroofed building, made wooden bricks architectural principle pound, taking tea new china tea-things, looked simply ridiculous. Dot's eyes, however, saw defects, she clapped vehemently. "Here, ladies gentlemen," said Sam, waving his hand politely towards rocking-chair, "you see great city Lisbon, capital Portugal--" At display geographical accuracy Dot fairly cheered, rocked herself fro unmitigated enjoyment. "--as appeared," continued showman, "on morning November 1st, 1755." Never occasion apply Mangnall's Questions exigencies every-day life, date way disturbed Dot's comfort. "In house," Sam proceeded, "a party Portuguese ladies rank may seen taking tea together." "_Breakfast_, mean," said Dot, "you said morning, know." "Well, took tea breakfast," said Sam. "Do not interrupt me, Dot. You audience, must not speak. Here see horses English ambassador airing his groom. There see two peasants--no! _not_ Noah his wife, Dot, go talking I shall shut up. I say peasants peacefully driving cattle. At moment rumbling sound startles everyone city"--here Sam rolled croquet balls box, dolls sat quiet before, Dot alone startled,--"this succeeded slight shock"--here he shook table, upset buildings belonging German farm.--"Some houses fell."--Dot began look anxious.--"This shock followed several others"---"Take care," she begged--"of increasing magnitude."--"Oh, Sam!" Dot shrieked, jumping up, "you are breaking china!"--"The largest buildings shook foundations."--"Sam! Sam! doll's house falling," Dot cried, making wild efforts save it: Sam held her back one arm, he began pull boards formed his table.--"Suddenly ground split opened fearful yawn"--Dot's shrieks shamed impassive dolls, Sam jerked boards dexterous movement, doll's house, brick buildings, farm, Swiss cottages, whole toy-stock nursery sank together ruins. Quite unabashed evident damage, Sam continued--"and moment whole magnificent city Lisbon swallowed up. Dot! Dot! do not muff! What matter? It is splendid fun. Things must broken time, I am sure exactly like real thing. Dot! do not speak? Dot! dear Dot! You do not care, you? I did not think you would mind so. It splendid earthquake. Oh! try go like that!" But Dot's feelings far beyond her control, much Master Sam, moment. She gasping choking, last she found breath throw herself her face upon floor bitter uncontrollable sobbing. It certainly mild punishment condemned Master Sam back nursery rest day. It had, however, additional severity, afternoon Aunt Penelope expected arrive. AUNT PENELOPE. Aunt Penelope one dear, good souls who, single themselves, have, real adopted relatives, interests dozen families, instead one, heart. There people whose youth owned influence least one friend. It may good habit, first interest life-loved pursuit favourite author, pretty feminine art, delicate womanly counsel enforced narratives real life interesting fiction: may periodical return gifts kindness, store family histories one else tell; owe something aunt uncle--the fairy godmothers real life. The benefits Sam Dot reaped Aunt Penelope's visits may summed heads presents stories, general leaning indulgence matters punishment, lessons, going bed, perhaps natural aunts uncles positive responsibilities young people's education, daily sufferers lack due discipline. Aunt Penelope's presents lovely. Aunt Penelope's stories charming. There generally moral wrapped them, like motto cracker-bonbon; quite inside, speak, abundance smart paper sugar-plums. All things considered, certainly proper much-injured Dot dressed her best, access dessert, dining-room, Aunt Penelope, whilst Sam kept up-stairs. And yet Dot (her first burst grief over) fought stoutly his pardon time she dressed, afterwards detected act endeavouring push fragments raspberry tart nursery keyhole. "You GOOD thing!" Sam emphatically exclaimed, he heard her fierce conflict side door nurse found her--"You GOOD thing! leave alone, I deserve it." He really penitent He fond Dot regret unexpected degree distress he caused her; Dot made much his penitence her intercessions drawing-room. "Sam sorry," she said; "he says he knows he deserves it. I think he ought come down. He _very_ sorry!" Aunt Penelope, usual, took lenient side, joining her entreaties Dot's, ended Master Sam's hurriedly scrubbed brushed, shoved his black velvet suit, sent down-stairs, rather red eyelids, looking sheepish. "Oh, Dot!" he exclaimed, soon he could get her corner, "I very, sorry! particularly tea-things." "Never mind," said Dot, "I do not care; I have asked story, we are going library." As Dot said this, she jerked her head expressively direction sofa, Aunt Penelope casting stitches preparatory beginning pair her famous ribbed socks Papa, whilst she gave Mamma's conversation sympathy (like her knitting-needles) always service her large circle friends. Dot anxiously watched bow top her cap danced nodded force Mamma's observations. At last gave little chorus jerks, one say, "Certainly, undoubtedly." And story came end, Dot, slowly creeping nearer, fairly took Aunt Penelope hand, carried her off, knitting all, library. "Now, please," said Dot, she struggled chair tall her. "Stop minute!" cried Sam, perched opposite one, "the horse-hair tickles legs." "Put pocket-handkerchief them, I do," said Dot. "_Now_, Aunt Penelope." "No, wait," groaned Sam; "it is not big enough; covers one leg." Dot slid again, ran Sam. "Take handkerchief other." "But do?" said Sam. "Oh, I do not care," said Dot, scrambling back her place. "Now, Aunty, please." And Aunt Penelope began. "THE LAND OF LOST TOYS. "I suppose people children transfer childish follies fancies them, become properly sedate grown-up.

I bent head seconds, and, closing eyes, drank delicious suggestive scents earth moss dear old tree. I long parted place I could hardly believe I old familiar spot. Surely one many dreams I played beneath trees! But I re-opened eyes hole, and, oddly enough, beetle one like it. I noticed till moment much larger hole used young days. "'I suppose rain forth wears away time,' I said vaguely. "'I suppose does,' said beetle politely; 'will walk in?' "I do not know I overpoweringly astonished would imagine. I think I good deal absorbed considering size hole, foolish wish seized I often longed childhood, creep in. I _had_ much regard propriety see one witness escapade. Then I tucked skirts round me, put spectacles pocket fear get broken, I went. "I must say one thing. A wood charming enough (no one appreciates myself), but, never there, idea much nicer inside surface. Oh, mosses--the gorgeous mosses! The fretted lichens! The fungi like flowers beauty, flowers like nothing ever seen! "Where beetle went I do not know. I could stand quite well, I wandered till dusk unwearied admiration. I among large beeches grew dark, beginning wonder I find way (not I lost it, none lose), suddenly lights burst every tree, whole place illuminated. The nearest approach scene I ever witnessed ground wood near Hague Holland. There, look like tiny glass tumblers holding floating wicks, fastened trunks fine old trees, intervals sufficient distance make light shade mysterious, give effect full blaze reach spot hanging chains lamps illuminate 'Pavilion' open space band plays, townsfolk assemble hundreds drink coffee enjoy music. I reminded Dutch 'bosch' because, wandering time among lighted trees, I heard distant sounds music, came last upon glade lit similar manner, except whole effect incomparably brilliant. "As I stood moment doubting whether I proceed, good deal puzzled whole affair, I caught sight large spider crouched corner his stomach ground his knees his head, spiders sit, looking me, I fancied, pair spectacles. (About spectacles I feel sure. It may two his bent legs apparent connection his prominent eyes.) I thought beetle, said civilly, 'Can tell me, sir, Fairyland?' The spider took his spectacles (or untucked his legs), took sideways run his corner. "'Well,' he said, 'it is Province. The fact is, it is Land Lost Toys. You have not thing fly anywhere you, you?' "'No,' I said, 'I am sorry say I not.' This strictly true, I sorry; I wished civil old gentleman, he projected his eyes intense (I almost said greedy) gaze, I felt quite frightened. "'How pass sentries?' he inquired. "'I never saw any,' I answered. "'You could not seen anything did not see them,' he said; 'but perhaps do not know. They are glow-worms. Six tree, light road, challenge passers-by. Why did not challenge you?' "'I do not know,' I began, 'unless beetle--' "'I do not like beetles,' interrupted spider, stretching leg turn sticking him,  she will, flavour. You never tried walking anything sort, you?' he pointed one leg long thread fastened web his head. "'Certainly not,' said I. "'I am afraid would not bear you,' he observed slowly. "'I am quite sure would not,' I hastened reply. I would not try worlds. It would spoil pretty work moment. Good-evening.' "And I hurried forward. Once I looked back, spider following me. He his hole again, his stomach, his knees his head, looking (apparently his spectacles) road I came. "I soon forgot sight me. I reached open place lights music; shall I describe spectacle I beheld? "I spoken effect toy-shop feelings. Now imagine toy-fair, brighter gayer brightest bazaar ever seen, held open glade, forest-trees stood majestically behind glittering stalls, stretched gigantic arms heads, brilliant thousand hanging lamps. At moment entrance silent quiet. The toys lay places looking incredibly attractive I reflected disgust ready cash, except one shilling coppers, melted away amid tawdry fascinations village booth. I counting coppers (sevenpence halfpenny), moment dozen sixpenny fiddles leaped places began play, accordions sizes joined them, drumsticks beat upon drums, penny trumpets sounded, yellow flutes took melody high notes, bore away trees. It weird fairy-music, quite delightful. The nearest approach I know ground hear wild dreamy air well whistled pianoforte accompaniment. "When music began, toys rose. The dolls jumped began dance. The poodles barked, pannier donkeys wagged ears, wind-mills turned, puzzles put together, bricks built houses, balls flew side side, battledores shuttlecocks kept among themselves, skipping-ropes went round, hoops ran off, sticks ran them, cobbler's wax tails green frogs gave way, jumped moment, whilst old-fashioned go-cart ran madly nobody inside. It exhilarating. "I soon became aware beetle elbow. "'There beautiful toys here,' I said. "'Well, yes,' he replied, 'and odd-looking ones too. You see, whatever really used child plaything gets right come end; queer company, I assure you. Look there.' "I looked, said, 'It seems potato.' "'So is,' said beetle. 'It belonged Irish child one great cities. But child belonged I do not know, I do not think he knew himself. He lived corner dirty, overcrowded room, corner, one day, potato rolled. It plaything he ever had. He stuck two cinders eyes, scraped nose mouth, loved it. He sat upon day, fear taken him, dark he took played it. He often hungry, he never ate potato. When he died rolled corner, swept ashes. Then came here.' "'What sad story!' I exclaimed. "The beetle seemed way affected. "'It curious thing,' he rambled on, 'that potato takes quite good place among toys. You see, rank precedence entirely question age; is, length time plaything possession child; kinds ugly old things hold first rank; whereas costly beautiful works art often smashed lost spoilt children rich people two three days. If care sad stories, another queer thing belonging child died.' "It appeared large sheet canvas strange kind needlework upon it. "'It belonged little girl rich household,' beetle continued; 'she invalid, difficult amuse. We lots her toys, pretty ones too. At last one taught her make caterpillars wool-work. A bit work done certain stitch cut scissors, made look like hairy caterpillar. The child took this, cared nothing else. Wool every shade procured her, she made caterpillars colours. Her complaint turn butterflies. However, she sweet, gentle-tempered child, she went on, hoping would so, making new ones. One day she heard talking laughing her bed joy. She said caterpillars become butterflies many colours, room full them. In happy fancy she died.' "'And caterpillars came here?' "'Not long time,' said beetle; 'her mother kept _she_ lived, lost came down. No toys come till broken lost.' "'What sticks here?' I asked. "The music ceased, toys lying quiet. Up corner leaned large bundle walking-sticks. They often sold toy-shops, I wondered grounds came here. "'Did ever meet benevolent old gentleman wondering earth his sticks go to?' said beetle. 'Why lend grandchildren? The young rogues use hobby-horses lose them, come, sentinels cannot stop them. The real hobby-horses will not allow ride them, however. There meeting subject. Every stick put examination. "Where nose? Where mane? Where wheels?" The last poser. Some got noses, none got wheels. So true hobby-horses. Something kind occurred elder-whistles.' "'The what?' I asked. "'Whistles boys make elder-sticks pith scooped out,' said beetle. 'The real instruments would allow play them. The elder-whistles said would joined asked. They amateurs, never played professionals. So private concerts combs curl-papers. But, bless you, toys kind endless here! Teetotums made old cotton reels, tea-sets acorn cups, dinner-sets old shells, monkeys made bits sponge, sorts things made breastbones merrythoughts, old packs cards always building houses getting knocked band begins play, feathers, rabbits' tails--' "'Ah! I heard rabbits' tails,' I said. "'There are,' beetle continued; 'and band plays see skip run. I do not believe would find bodies, experience warren is, rabbits skip run tails chiefly see. But amateur toys successful boats. We lake craft, know, there is quite fleet boats made old cork floats fishing villages. Then, see, old bits cork really sea, seen good deal service herring-nets, quite take lead smart shop ships, never beyond pond tub water. But that is exception. Amateur toys mostly dowdy. Look box.' "I looked, thought I must seen before, wondered common-looking box without lid affect strangely, memory seem struggling bring back past. Suddenly came me--it old Toy Box.

"'What staring at?' said beetle. "'It is old Toy Box!' I exclaimed. "The beetle rolled his back, struggled helplessly his legs: I turned over. (Neither first last time showing attention beetles.) "'That is right,' he said, 'set legs. What turn gave me! You do not mean say toys here? If have, sooner make way home better.' "'Why?' I inquired. "'Well,' he said, 'there is strong feeling place. The toys think ill-treated, taken care children general. And truth it. Toys come scores broken first day. And quite resolved old masters mistresses come way shall punished.' "'How punished?' I inquired. "'Exactly toys, toys them. All perfectly fair regular.' "'I do not know I treated mine particularly badly,' I said; 'but I think I would rather go.' "'I think you would better,' said beetle. 'Good-evening!' I saw more. "I turned go, somehow I lost road.

"The horrible idea speaker might possibly power enforce his sentence diverted attention slate, I looked round. In front Jack-in-a-box stood tiny red flower-pot saucer, miniature cactus.

"Not another earthquake, I hope?" said Dot, smiling. "Now, Dot, that is truly unkind you. I thought forgotten." "So is," said Dot, getting up. "I joking. What idea?" "I do not think I shall tell till I finished shop. I want get now, I wish would take turn glue-pot." Sam apt want change occupation.

This story Three Christmas Trees. The first real one, child speak see it. He saw two, real; existed his fancy. The plot story simple; and, described early, easy think stupid lay book good time. Probably every child reads seen one Christmas tree more; small town distant colony do, could one time said. Christmas-trees means universal, even England, are, little colonial town unknown. Unknown, is, till Governor's wife gave her great children's party. At point begin story. The Governor given great many parties his time. He entertained big wigs little wigs, passing military, local grandees. Everybody remotest claim attention attended to: ladies full share balls pleasure parties: one class population complaint prefer his hospitality; class large one--it children. However, he, bachelor, knew little nothing little boys girls: let us pity rather blame him. At last he took wife; among many advantages important step, due recognition claims young citizens. It towards happy Christmas-tide "the Governor's amiable admired lady" (as she styled local newspaper) sent notes her first children's party. At top note-paper red robin, carried blue Christmas greeting his mouth, bottom--written A.D.C.'s best flourish--were magic words, _A Christmas Tree_. In spite flourishes--partly perhaps them--the A.D.C.'s handwriting, though handsome, rather illegible. But this, children invited contrived read words, could slow learn news hearsay. There Christmas Tree! It would like birthday party, ordinary birthdays, presents every one. One children invited lived little white house, spruce fir-tree door. The spruce fir good service little house, helped people find way it; means easy stranger find his way given house little town, especially house small white, stood one back streets. For houses small, painted white, back streets ran parallel other, names, much alike confusing. For instance, asked way Mr. So-and-So is, probable friend would directed follows: "Go straight forward take first turning left, find four streets, run right angles one in, parallel other. Each got big pine it--one old forest trees. Take last street one, fifth white house come Mr. So-and-So is. He green blinds coloured servant." You would always got clear directions these, would probably found house last, partly accident, partly blinds coloured servant. Some neighbours affirmed little white house name; houses streets names, traditional recorded anywhere; people knew them, nobody made use them. The name little white house said Trafalgar Villa, seemed inappropriate modest peaceful little home, man lived tried find called. He thought his predecessor must navy, he found he owner called "dry-goods store," seems mean shop things sold good eat drink--such drapery. At last somebody said, public-house called "Duke Wellington" corner street, probably nearer one called "The Nelson," burnt down, man built "The Nelson" built house spruce fir it, name arisen. An explanation far probable, public-houses fires frequent occurrence parts. But nothing story. Only must say, said before, said living then, child speak lived little white house one spruce fir front it. Of children looked forward Christmas tree, he looked forward intensely. He imaginative child, simple, happy nature, easy please. His father Englishman, long winter evenings he would tell child tales old country, his mother would listen also. Perhaps parents enjoyed stories most. To boy new, consequently delightful, parents old; regards stories, better still. "What kind bird letter?" asked boy day brought Governor's lady's note invitation. "And oh! Christmas tree?" "The bird English robin," said his father. "It quite another bird called robin here: smaller rounder, redder breast bright dark eyes, lives sings home winter. A Christmas tree fir-tree--just one outside door--brought house covered lights presents. Picture fir-tree lighted tapers branches, dolls, trumpets, bon-bons, drums, toys kinds hanging like fir-cones, tip-top shoot figure Christmas Angel white, star upon head." "Fancy!" said boy. And fancy he did. Every day he looked spruce fir, tried imagine laden presents, brilliant tapers, thought wonderful must "old country"--_Home_, called, even never seen it--where robins red, Christmas fir-trees hung toys instead cones. It certainly pity that, two days party, original idea subject snowmen struck one children used play together, sleds snow shoes, back streets. The idea this: That instead commonplace snowman, whose legs obliged mere stumps, fear he top-heavy, could walk, even them; who, fact, could nothing stand corner street, holding his impotent stick, staring his pebble eyes, till he broken pieces ignominiously carried away thaw,--that, instead this, real, live snowman, walk competent legs, astonishment, (happy thought!) perhaps alarm passers-by. This delightful novelty accomplished covering one boys party snow till he looked like real snowman circumstances would admit. At first everybody wanted snowman, but, came point, found much duller stand still covered run work, one willing act part. At last undertaken little boy Fir House. He somewhat small, he good-natured he would always he asked. So he stood manfully still, his arms folded walking-stick upon his breast, whilst others heaped snow upon him. The plan successful hoped. The snow would stick anywhere except his shoulders, got his neck he cried cold; anxious carry project, begged bear "just little longer"; urchin devised original idea wiped child's eyes his handkerchief, (with hopefulness easy people's matters) "dared say snow on, he would not feel it." However, he feel it, severely children obliged give game, and, taking stick his stiff little arms, lead home. It appears snowmen men conspicuous positions. It easier find fault fill place. The end feverish cold, and, day party came, ex-snowman still bed. It due children say felt disappointment keenly he did, greatly damped pleasure party think prevented his sharing treat. The penitent deviser original idea. He generously offered stay home little patient, generously refused; next evening he allowed come sit his bed, describe amusement his friend. He quaint boy, urchin, face broad American Indian's, eyes bright squirrel's, mischief life lurking him, till could see roguishness folds his hooded Indian winter coat blue scarlet. In his hand he brought sick child's present: dray two white horses, little barrels took on, driver, wooden joints, cloth coat, everything, fact, suitable driver brewer's dray, except he blue boots earrings, his hair painted braids like lady's, clearly fault doll manufacturers, persist making weaker sex. "And Christmas tree like?" asked invalid. "Exactly like fir outside door," reply. "Just size, planted pot covered red cloth. It kept another room till tea, door opened like street fire town night--such blaze light--candles everywhere! And branches beautiful presents. I got drum penwiper." "Was angel?" child asked. "Oh, yes!" boy answered. "It tip-top branch, given me, I brought you, would like it; for, know, I very, sorry I thought snowman made ill, I love you, beg forgive me." And roguish face stooped pillow kissed; pocket hooded coat came forth Christmas Angel. In face bore strong family likeness drayman, feet hidden folds snowy muslin, head glittered tinsel star. "How lovely!" said child. "Father told this. I like best all. And kind you, fault I caught cold. I liked could done it, I think enjoy snowman, one snow through." They tea together, invalid tucked night. The dray put away cupboard, he took angel bed him. And ended first Three Christmas Trees. * * * * * Except warm glow wood fire stove, room dark; midnight seemed child sudden blaze light filled chamber. At moment window curtains drawn aside, he saw spruce fir come close panes peeping in. Ah! beautiful looked! It become Christmas tree. Lighted tapers shone every familiar branch, toys fascinating appearance hung like fruit, tip-top shoot stood Christmas Angel. He tried count candles, somehow impossible. When he looked seemed change places--to move--to become like angel, candles again, whilst flames nodded repeated blue greeting robin, "A Merry Christmas Happy New Year!" Then he tried distinguish presents, but, beautiful toys looked, he could exactly discover were, choose he would like best. Only Angel he could see clearly--so clearly! It beautiful doll his pillow; lovely face like his mother's, he thought, head gleamed star far brighter tinsel. Its white robes waved flames tapers, stretched arms towards smile. "I go choose present," thought child; he called "Mother! Mother dear! please open window." But his mother answer. So he thought he must get himself, effort he struggled bed. But he his feet, everything seemed changed! Only firelight shone upon walls, curtains firmly closed window. It dream, vivid his feverish state he still thought must true, dragged curtains back let glorious sight again. The firelight shone upon thick coating frost upon panes, could he see, his strength he pushed window open leaned night. The spruce fir stood old place; looked beautiful Christmas dress. Beneath lay carpet pure white. The snow clustered exquisite shapes upon plumy branches; wrapping tree top little cross shoots, white robe might wrap figure outstretched arms. There tapers seen, northern lights shot dark blue sky, fir-tree shone bright, bright star. "Jupiter looks well to-night," said old Professor town observatory, he fixed his telescope; child seemed star Christmas Angel. His mother really heard call, came put back bed again. And ended second Three Christmas Trees. * * * * * It enough killed him, his friends said; not. He lived man, and--what rarer--to keep faith, simplicity, tender-heartedness, vivid fancy his childhood. He lived see many Christmas trees "at home," old country robins redbreasts, sing winter. There heart good gentle his became one his; he brought his young wife across sea visit place he born. They stood near little white house, he told her story Christmas trees. "This I child," he added. "But still," said she; she plucked bit fir-tree kissed it, carried away. He lived tell story his children, even his grandchildren; he never able decide two beautiful--the Christmas Tree his dream, Spruce Fir stood loveliness winter night. This told, anything Three Christmas Trees, show story happy one, right proper; hero lived, married, children, prosperous good people, books, always be. Of course he died last. The best happiest men must die; stories stop short history, every hero duly buried lay book. When death came hero he old man. The beloved wife, his children, many his friends died him, he loved fewer leave rejoin. He short illness, little pain, lying his deathbed one big towns North England. His youngest son, clergy-man, him, one two others his children, fire sat doctor. The doctor sitting patient, he could he moved fire; taken ghastly, half-emptied medicine bottles table bedside, spread fair linen cloth, set silver vessels Supper Lord. The old man "wandering" somewhat day. He talked much going home old country, wide range dying thoughts he seemed mingle memories childhood his hopes Paradise. At intervals he clear collected--one moments chosen his last sacrament--and he fallen asleep blessing his ears. He slept long peacefully son almost began hope might change, looked towards doctor, still sat fire his right leg crossed his left. The doctor's eyes also bed, moment he drew his watch looked air professional conviction, said, "It is question time." Then he crossed his left leg his right, turned fire again. Before right leg tired, would over. The son saw clearly spoken, he turned away sighed. As sat, bells church town began chime midnight service, Christmas Eve, wake dying man. He slept on. The doctor dozed. The son read Prayer Book table, one his sisters read him. Another, grief weariness, slept her head upon his shoulder. Except warm glow fire, room dark. Suddenly old man sat bed, and, strong voice, cried inexpressible enthusiasm, "_How beautiful!_" The son held back his sisters, asked quietly, "_What_, dear Father?" "The Christmas Tree!" he said low, eager voice. "Draw back curtains." They drawn back; nothing could seen, still old man gazed ecstasy. "Light!" he murmured. "The Angel! Star!" Again silence; he stretched forth his hands, cried passionately, "The Angel beckoning me! Mother! Mother dear! Please open window." The sash thrown open, eyes turned involuntarily dying man gazing. There Christmas tree--no tree all. But house-tops morning star looked pure pale dawn Christmas Day. For night past, distant hum streets clear voices waits made words old carol heard--words dearer association poetry: "While shepherds watched flocks night, All seated ground, The Angel Lord came down, And glory shone around." When window opened, soul passed; looked back bed old man lain again, and, like child, smiling his sleep--his last sleep. And Third Christmas Tree. * * * * * AN IDYLL OF THE WOOD. "Tell us story," said children, "a sad one, please, little true. But, all, let end badly, tired people live happily ever after." "I heard one lately," said old man lived wood; "it founded fact, sad one also; whether ends badly I cannot pretend say. That matter taste: bad ending?" "A story ends badly," said children authority, "when people die, nobody marries anybody else, especially prince princess." "A lucid explanation," said old man. "I think story do, principal character dies, wedding." "Tell it, tell it!" cried his hearers, "and tell us also got from." "Who knows riches wood summer?" said old man. "In summer, I say? In spring, autumn, winter either. Who knows them? You, children? Well, well. Better elders, perchance. You know wood I live; hollow tree hold five children, Queen Mab knows many fairies. (What castle makes! And another floor put it, sloping ladder--like one round towers Ireland--what house children live in! With room lesson-books, grown-up people, beds!) "You know way hazel copse, place wild strawberries grow. You know wren sits her eggs, and, like good children, pass soft steps hushed voices, may disturb little mother. You know (for I shown you) rare fern grows--a habitat happily yet unnoted scientific pages. _We_ never add lovely fronds nosegays, move root plant another part wood, much mystery circumspection performing solemn druidical rite. It us king hiding, places abode keep faithfully secret. It thus held sacred us until, seed untouched fronds scattered, offshoots propagated, shall become plentiful Heaven intends beautiful things be. Every one scrupulous. There certain ladies gentlemen picnic near cottage hot weather, tell love wood. Most good people nevertheless neither eyes ears goes around them, except hear other, see cold collation. They picnic summer summer, know whether sit oaks ashes, beeches elms. All birds sing song. Tell _them_ plant rare neighbourhood, specimens it, long fault any. Does one direct it, tear ruthlessly carry away. If chance root left, left dragged pulled denuded earth, small chance survive. Probably, also, ravished clump dies garden pot transplanted, either neglect, ignorance conditions essential life; rare plant becomes yet rarer. Oh! without doubt love wood. It gives shade largest umbrella, cheaper summer entertainment tent: get canopy carpet, fuel water, shade song, beauty--all gratis; small matters one invited large party one's acquaintance. There insects, true, somewhat disturb friends; know sting, harmless, kill come within reach, safe general principle. The town boys, too! They know wood--that say, know wild fruits grow, chase squirrel, rob birds' nests, snare birds. Well, well, children; know love wood truly, may one must live I done; lifetime scarcely reveal beauties, exhaust lessons. But even then, one must eyes see, ears hear, one misses good deal. It wood I heard story I shall tell you." "How hear it?" asked children. "A thrush sang one night." "One night?" said children. "Then mean nightingale." "I mean thrush," said old man. "Do I know note one bird another? I tell pine-tree cottage legend own, topmost branch haunted. Must legends loves sorrows self-satisfied race alone?" "But really truly hear it?" asked. "I heard it," said old man. "But, I tell you, one hears one hears. I do not say everybody would heard it, merely sleeping chamber; but, benefit least imaginative, I assure founded fact." "Begin! begin!" shouted children. "Once upon time," said old man, "there young thrush, born beautiful dingle last planted ---- fern. His home-nest close ground, lower one is, less fear falling; woods, elevation sleep matter taste, expense gentility. He awoke life wood dressed pale fresh green early summer; believing, like folk, his home least principal part world, earth seemed happy beautiful abode, his heart felt ready burst joy. The ecstasy almost pain, till wings voice came him. Then, one day, when, grey morning, sun came noon, drawing scent old pine looks bedroom window, his joy burst forth, long silence, song, flying upwards, he sat topmost branch pine, sang loud he could sing sun blue sky. "'Joy! joy!' he sang. 'Fresh water green woods, ambrosial sunshine sunflecked shade, chattering brooks rustling leaves, glade, sward, dell. Lichens cool mosses, feathered ferns flowers. Green leaves! Green leaves! Summer! summer! summer!' "It monotonous, every word came singer's heart, always case. Thenceforward, though he slept near ground, he went every day pine, sacred high place, sang song, neither he I ever weary. "Let one ever inoffensive, however, one long left peace world, even wood. The thrush sang loudly his simple happiness, boys town heard snared him, took away dirty cloth cap, he nearly smothered. The world certainly exclusively composed sunshine, green woods, odorous pines. He became almost senseless hot dusty walk led town. It seaport town, two miles wood, town narrow, steep streets, picturesque old houses, odours compounded tar, dead fish, many scents less agreeable forest perfumes. The thrush put small wicker-cage upper room, one narrowest steepest streets. "'I shall die to-night,' he piped. But he not. He lived night, several nights days following. The boys took small care him, however. He often left without food, without water, always little air. Two three times tried sell him, he bought, one could hear sing. One day he hung outside window, partly owing sun fresh air, partly woman singing street, he began carol his old song. "The woman street singer. She even paler, thinner, destitute-looking women usually are. In past time beauty feeling her face, traces well-nigh gone. An indifference almost amounting vacancy now, and, except she sang, might almost fancied her corpse. In her voice, also, beauty feeling, traces small indeed. From time time, she stopped fits coughing, ill-favoured hunchback, accompanied her tambourine, swore scowled her. She sang song sentiment, refrain 'Love truth, And joys youth--' melody dwelt quavered mockery. As she sang, sailor came street. His collar large, his trousers wide, his hat hung back his head ornament shelter; he one roughest faces gentlest hearts ever went together since Beauty entertained Beast. His hands his pockets, he could feel one shilling penny, spare cash remained friendly stroll town. When he saw street singer, he stopped, pulled his hat, scratched his head, his custom he puzzled interested. "'It is good keeping odd penny,' he said himself; 'poor thing, she looks bad enough!' And, bringing penny surface depths his pocket, he gave woman. The hunchback came forward take it, sailor passed shove his elbow, gave singer, handed her companion without moving feature, went her song. "'I would like break every bone ugly body,' muttered sailor, glance hunchback, scowled return. "'I shall die close street, I suffered,' thought thrush. "'Green leaves! green leaves!' he sang, song he knew. "'My voice gone,' thought hunchback's companion. 'He will beat to-night; cannot last long: "Love truth, And joys youth"'-- she sang, song she learned; her fault inappropriate. "But ballad-singer's captivity nearly end. When hunchback left her evening spend sailor's penny others she earned, he swore he came back he would make her sing louder she done day. Her face showed emotion, less he saw hours after, beauty feeling seemed returned peace death, he came back found cage empty, long-prisoned spirit flown away seek face love truth indeed. "But thrush? "The sailor scarcely swallowed wrath hunchback stirred him, his ear caught song thrush him. "'You sing uncommon well, pretty one,' he said, stopping putting his hat even farther back usual look up. He one good people stop dozen times one street, look everything go along; whereby may see three times much life folk, terrible temptation spend money. It instance. The sailor looked till his kindly eye perceived bird ill-cared for. "'It bit sod, _should_,' he said emphatically, taking his hat off, scratching his head again; 'and there is crumb food board. Maybe, do not understand ways birds here. It would good turn mention it.' "With charitable intention he entered house, he left it, his pocket empty, thrush carried tenderly his handkerchief. "'The canary died last voyage,' he muttered apologetically himself, 'and money always go somehow other.' "The sailor's hands three times large coarse boy carried thrush before, seemed three times light tender--they handy kind, goes farther taper fingers. "The thrush's new home narrow streets. It small cottage small garden back town. The canary's old cage comparatively roomy, food, water, fresh turf regularly supplied him. He could see green leaves too. There apple-tree garden, two geraniums, fuchsia, tea-rose window. Near tea-rose old woman sat sunshine. She sailor's mother, looked like tidily-kept window-plant herself. She little money her own, gave her certain dignity, her son good her; she dwelt considerable comfort, dividing her time chiefly reading big Bible, knitting socks Jack, raising cuttings bottles water. She heard hothouses forcing-frames, she think much them. She believed bottle water natural, oldest method she knew of, she thought good came new-fangled ways, trying outdo Nature. "'Slow sure best,' she said, stuck her system. "'What is that, dear?' she asked, sailor came held handkerchief. He told her. "'You are always a-laying money something other,' said old lady, took privilege her years little testy. 'What give _that_?' "'A shilling, madam.' "'Tst! tst! tst!' said old lady, disapprovingly. "'Now, Mother, do not shake cap head,' said sailor. 'What is shilling? If I had not spent it, I changed it; change shilling, dribbles away coppers, get nothing it. But spend lump, get something want. That is I say.' "'_I_ want pets,' said old lady, stiffly. "'Well, will not troubled one long,' said her son; 'it will go me, that is soon enough.' "Any allusion his departure always melted old lady, Jack well knew. She became tearful, begged leave thrush her. "'You know, dear, I have always looked live things Christians; loved (unless monkey I never _could_ with!). Leave me, dear. I would never bother bird board ship, I you.' "'That is you have got handsome son own, old lady,' chuckled sailor; 'I have neither chick child, madam, remember, man must something look to. The bird'll go me.' "And came pass thrush becoming domesticated, almost happy cottage, one morning sailor brought fresh turf groundsel, besides his meal-cake, took cage down. And old woman kissed wires, bade bird good-bye, blessed her son, prayed Heaven bring safe home again; went way. "The forecastle steam-ship (even big one) poor exchange snug cottage one sailor. To Jack, ship home. _He_ never lived wood, carolled tree-tops. He preferred blue green, pine masts pine trees; he smoked his pipe comfortably forecastle, whilst ship rolled fro, swung bird's cage his head. To thrush imprisonment grew worse time went on. Each succeeding day made pine bitterly his native woods--for fresh air green leaves, rest quiet, sweet perfumes, pleasant sounds country life. His turf dried up, his groundsel withered, could got. He longed even back old woman--to see apple-tree, window-plants, still. The shudder screw, blasts hot air engine cook's galley, ceaseless jangling, clanging, pumping noises, indescribable smells haunt steam-ship, became wearisome day day. Even cage hung outside, the, sea breeze seemed mock freshness. The rich blue waters gave pleasure, his eyes failed looking green, bitter, salt spray vexed him, wind often chilled bone, whilst sun shone, icebergs gleamed upon horizon. "The sailor kind master, thrush become deeply attached him, birds will; cottage he scarcely fretted his beloved wood. But every hour voyage, home-sickness came strongly upon him, his heart went back nest, pine-top, old home. When one sleeps soundly, seldom one remembers one's dreams; one apt roused unexpected lurch ship, moan fog-whistle, scream engine, one becomes light sleeper, visions night strange reality, easily recalled. And thrush always dreamt home. "One day he hung outside. It fine day, he looked drooping, pitying sailor brought out, get air. His heart sore home-sickness, he watched sea-birds skimming envious eyes. It seemed well poor men, had not much wing carry water, build lumbering sea-nests, bodies float water like fish, wings canvas carry along, help noisy steam-engines--and endure all. But him, could fly hundred tree-tops man could climb one, hard swing outside ship, watch birds use wings, his, quivered fly homewards, could flutter bars. As he thought, roll ship threw forward, wind shook wires cage, loosened fastening; and, vessel righted, cage-door swung slowly open. "At moment, ray sunshine streaked deep blue water, gleaming sea bird, sitting like tuft foam upon wave, rose outstretched pinions, soared away. It much. With one shrill pipe hope, thrush fluttered his cage, spread his wings, followed him. "When sailor found wind getting up, he came take cage down, his grief sore indeed. "'The canary died last voyage,' he said, sadly. 'The cage bought Friday, I knew ill luck would come it. I said Mother; old lady says there is thing luck, she is Bible-learned, ever woman was. "That is true," says I, "but I would money another cage, I would not use this;" I never again. Poor, bird! sweet singer.' And he turned his face aside. "'It may sense come back,' said one crew. The sailor scratched his head, shook sadly. "'Noah's bird came back him, she found rest,' he said, 'but I do not think mine will, Tom.' "He right. The thrush returned more. He know wide difference his strength bird he followed. The sea-fowl cut air wings tenfold power: he swooped down, he stooped fish, he rested ridges dancing waves, then, one steady flight, he disappeared, thrush left alone. Other birds passed him, flew him, fished, rocked upon waters near him, he held steadily on. Ships passed also, far away rest upon; whales spouted distance, strange fowl screamed; familiar object broke expanse cold sea. He know course he taking. He hoped hope he going home. Although he faint weary he ever yet been, he felt pain. The intensity his hope reach old wood made everything seem light; even last, his wings almost powerless, he believed would bear home, happy. Already he seemed rest upon trees, waters sounded his ears like rustling leaves, familiar scent pine-tree seemed come upon breeze. "In he wrong. A country pine-woods near; land sight, though far away reach now. Not home, yet land wondrous summer beauty; woods, flowers, sun-flecked leaves--of sunshine glowing he ever known--of larger ferns, deeper mosses, clearer skies--a land, balmy summer nights, stars shine brighter us, fireflies appear vanish, like stars lower firmament, amid trees. As sun broke out, scent pines came strong upon land breeze. A strange land, thrush thought his own. "'I smell woods,' he chirped faintly; 'I see sun. This home!' "All round him, noisy crests fresh waves seemed carol song he could longer sing--'Home, home! fresh water green woods, ambrosial sunshine sun-flecked shade, chattering brooks rustling leaves, glade sward dell, lichens cool mosses, feathered ferns flowers. Green leaves! green leaves! Summer! summer! summer!' "The slackened wings dropped, dying eyes looked landward, closed. But even he fell, he believed sinking rest Mother Earth's kindly bosom, he know it, cold waves buried sea." "Oh, then, he _did_ die!" cried children, who, though tired stories end happily, yet, heard it, liked sad ending better children (in which, bye, hold right, hardly forgive chronicling "ower true tale"). "Yes," said old man, "he died; said sweet dingle his home--forsaken nightingale--is regarded birds men regard haunted house; still summer midnight, thrushes sleep, shadowy form, like skeleton leaf living bird, swings upon tall tree-tops he sat old, and, rapt happy ecstasy, sings song sweet joyous thrush ever sang day." "Have heard it?" asked children. The old man nodded. But another word would he say. The children, however, forthwith began lay plans getting wood mid-summer night, test ears truth his story, hear spectre thrush's song. Whether authorities permitted expedition, not, whether young people baffled vigilance--whether heard song, so, whether understood it--we empowered tell here. * * * * * CHRISTMAS CRACKERS. A FANTASIA. It Christmas-eve old-fashioned country-house, Christmas kept old-fashioned form custom. It getting late. The candles swaggered sockets, yule log glowed steadily like red-hot coal. "The fire reached his heart," said tutor: "he warm through. How red he is! He shines heat hospitality like warm-hearted old gentleman convivial evening pretty far advanced. To-morrow he cold grey morning festival, glasses washed up, host calculating his expenses. Yes! know so;" tutor nodded yule log he spoke; log flared crackled return, till tutor's face shone like his own. He means reply. The tutor grotesque-looking time. He lank meagre, long body limbs, high shoulders. His face smooth-shaven, his skin like old parchment stretched high cheek-bones lantern jaws; hollow sockets his eyes gleamed changeful lustre two precious gems. In ruddy firelight like rubies, he drew back shade glared green like eyes cat. It must inferred tutor's presence evening Christmas holidays house. They begun days before; tutor home go to, presumed he would gone. As candles got lower, log flared less often, weird lights shades, haunt twilight, crept room. The tutor's shadow, longer, lanker, grotesque himself, mopped mowed upon wall beside him. The snapdragon burnt blue, raisin-hunters stirred flaming spirit, ghastly light made tutor look hideous widow's little boy eve howling, spilled raisins he secured. (He like putting his fingers flames, he hovered near adventurous school-boys collected raisins scattered table hasty _grabs_ braver hands.) The widow relative house. She married Mr. Jones, his life his devoted slave, his death transferred her allegiance his son. The late Mr. Jones small man strong temper, large appetite, taste drawing-room theatricals. So Mrs. Jones called her son Macready; "for," she said, "his poor papa would made fortune stage, I wish commemorate his talents. Besides, Macready sounds better Jones commoner Christian name would do." But his cousins called MacGreedy. "The apples enchanted garden guarded dragons. Many knights went them. One wished apples, he like fight dragons." It tutor spoke dark corner fire-place. His eyes shone like cat's, MacGreedy felt like half-scared mouse, made his mind cry. He put his right fist one eye, taken out, put his left fist other, he saw tutor longer looking him. So he made his mind go raisins, one peevish cry time, plums scattered broadcast every day. Several times he tried pocket them, moment tutor sure look him, his fright he dropped raisins, never could find again. So time he resolved eat there. He put one his mouth tutor leaned forward, his eyes, glowing firelight, met MacGreedy's, even presence mind shut his mouth, remained spellbound, raisin his cheek. Flicker, flack! The school-boys stirred snapdragon again, blue light upon his features tutor made horrible grimace MacGreedy swallowed raisin start. He bolted whole, might bread pill enjoyment he flavour. But tutor laughed aloud. He certainly alarming object, pulling grimaces blue brandy glare; unpleasantly like picture Bogy horns tail, juvenile volume upstairs. True, horns speak among tutor's grizzled curls, his coat seemed fit well people's his long back, unless he put his tail his pocket, difficult see he could one. But (as Miss Letitia said) "With dress one anything hide anything," dress Miss Letitia's opinion final. Miss Letitia cousin. She dark, high-coloured, glossy-haired, stout, showy. She neat new pin, her own. Her hair firmly fixed bandoline, her garibaldis arrangement failed applied widow, her opinions simple process looking everything one point view. Her _forte_ dress general ornamentation; Miss Letitia extravagant--far it. If one may use expression, she utilized ornament hundred bits scraps people would wasted. But, like artists, she saw everything medium her art. She looked birds eye hats, flowers reference evening parties. At picture exhibitions concerts she carried away jacket patterns bonnets her head, people make mental notes aerial effect, bit fine instrumentation. An enthusiastic horticulturist sent Miss Letitia cut specimen new flower. It lovely spray lately-imported shrub. A botanist would pressed it--an artist must taken portrait--a poet might written sonnet praise beauty. Miss Letitia twisted piece wire round stem, fastened her black lace bonnet. It came day review, Miss Letitia appear carriage, quite success. As she said widow, "It natural one could doubt Parisian." "What strange fellow tutor is!" said visitor. He spoke daughter house, girl face like summer's day, hair like ripe corn-field rippling sun. He fine young man, youth's taste sports amusements his age. But lately he changed. He seemed living higher, nobler atmosphere hitherto. He discovered he poetical--he might prove genius. He certainly eloquent, he could talk hours, so--to young lady sunshiny face. They spoke highest subjects, listener she was! So intelligent appreciative, exquisite _pose_ head--it must inspire block wood merely see creature listening attitude. As young friend, he poured forth volumes; he really clever, her he became eloquent. To-night he spoke Christmas, time-honoured custom old association; he said would made Christmas article magazine first class. He poured scorn cold nature could not, affectation would not, appreciate domestic festivities sacred season. What, he asked, could delightful, perfect gathering this, family circle round Christmas hearth? He spoke feeling, may said disinterested feeling, he joined his family circle Christmas, vacant place hearth his home. "He strange," said young lady (she spoke tutor answer remark); "but I fond him. He us long he like one family; though know little his history day he came." "He looks clever," said visitor. (Perhaps least one say fellow-creature shows great deal bare skull, otherwise good-looking.) "He clever," she answered, "wonderfully clever; clever odd sometimes I fancy he hardly 'canny.' There something almost supernatural his acuteness his ingenuity, kindly used; I wonder he brought playthings us to-night." "Playthings?" inquired young man. "Yes; birthdays festivals like he generally brings something huge pockets his. He world, he produces Indian puzzles, Japanese flower-buds bloom hot water, German toys complicated machinery, I suspect manufacturing himself. I call Godpapa Grosselmayer, delightful old fellow Hoffman's tale Nut Cracker." "What is crackers?" inquired tutor, sharply, his eyes changing colour like fire opal. "I talking _Nussnacker und Mausekönig_," laughed young lady. "Crackers belong Christmas; fireworks come 5th November." "Tut, tut!" said tutor; "I always tell ladyship still tom-boy heart, I first came, climbed trees pelted young students horse-chestnuts. You think crackers explode heels timorous old gentlemen November fog; I mean bonbon crackers, coloured crackers, dainty crackers--crackers young people mottoes sentiment" (here tutor shrugged his high shoulders inch two higher, turned palms his hands outwards glance indescribably comical)--"crackers paper prodigies, crackers sweetmeats--_such_ sweetmeats!" He smacked his lips grotesque contortion, looked Master McGreedy, choked his last raisin, forthwith burst tears. The widow tried vain soothe caresses, he stamped howled more. But Miss Letitia gave smart smacks shoulders cure his choking fit, she kept treatment vigour, young gentleman obliged stop assure her raisin "gone right way" last. "If he child," Miss Letitia known observe, confidence characterizes theories parents, "I would, &c., &c., &c.;" fact, Miss Letitia thought she would made different boy him--as, indeed, I believe she would. "Are crackers us, sir?" asked one two school-boys, hung tutor's chair. They twins, grand boys, broad, good-humoured faces, curly wigs, like two puppy dogs breed. They known apart intimate friends, always together, romping, laughing, snarling, squabbling, huffing helping world. Each owned wiry terrier, relations two dogs (who marvellously alike) closely followed example masters. "Do care crackers, Jim?" asked tutor. "Not much, sir. They girls: but, know, I care nothing military matters. Do remember beautiful toy yours--'The Besieged City'? Ah! I liked that. Look out, Tom! you are shoving arm. Cannot stand straight, man?' "R-r-r-r--r-r, snap!" Tom's dog resenting contact Jim's dog hearthrug. There hustle among four, subsided. "The Besieged City well you, Jim," said Tom, meant sailor; "but please remember admitted attack sea; do? Ah, sir! clever, I often think could help make swing ladders instead single ropes, I could run rigging whilst full go." "That would something like fir-tree prank, Tom," said his sister. "Can believe," she added, turning visitor, "that Tom lopped branches tall young fir-tree way up, leaving little bits foothold, climbed one day awful storm wind, clung top, rocking backwards forwards? And Papa sent word come down, he said parental authority superseded sea rules service. It dreadful storm, tree snapped soon he got safe ground." "Storm!" sneered Tom, "a capful wind. Well, blow half gale last. But oh! glorious!" "Let us see make crackers," said tutor--and he pulled his pocket. They put dish upon table, company choose from; terriers jumped snapped, tumbled other, thought plate contained eatables. Animated idea, quieter steps, Master MacGreedy also approached table. "The dogs noisy," said tutor, "too noisy. We must quiet--peace quiet." His lean hand his pocket, he pulled box, he took powder, he scattered burning log. A slight smoke rose hot embers, floated room. Was powder one strange compounds act upon brain? Was magician's powder? Who knows? With came sweet, subtle fragrance. It strange--every one fancied he smelt before, absorbed wondering was, met it. Even dogs sat haunches noses up, sniffing speculative manner. "It is lavender," said grandmother, slowly, "and it is rosemary. There something tansy (and fine tonic flavour too, dears, though it is _not_ fashion now). Depend upon it, it is potpourri, excellent receipt, sir"--and old lady bowed courteously towards tutor. "My mother made best potpourri county, much like this. Not quite, perhaps, much same, much same." The grandmother fine old gentlewoman "of old school," phrase is. She stately gracious her manners, daintily neat her person, much attached old parson parish, sat near her chair. All her life she proud her fine stock fair linen, household personal; many years past kept her graveclothes ready drawer. They bleached white snow, lay amongst bags dried lavender potpourri. Many times seemed likely would needed, old lady severe illnesses late, good parson sat her bedside, read her coming Bridegroom, "fine linen clean white," "the righteousness saints." It drawer, lavender potpourri bags, scented smoke reminded her. "It rather overpowering odour," said old parson; "it suggestive incense. I sure I smelt something like Church Nativity Bethlehem. It delicious." The parson's long residence his parish marked one great holiday. With savings many years he performed pilgrimage Holy Land; rather joke he illustrated large variety subjects reference his favourite topic, holiday his life. "It smells gunpowder," said Jim, decidedly, "and something else. I cannot tell what." "Something one smells seaport town," said Tom. "Cannot delicious then," Jim retorted. "It is _quite_ same," piped widow; "but reminds much old bottle attar roses given I school, copy verses, young gentleman brother one pupils. I remember Mr. Jones quite annoyed he found old box, I sure I touched ten years more; I never spoke once, Examination Day (the young gentleman, I mean). And like--yes it is certainly like hair-wash Mr. Jones used use. I have forgotten called, I know cost fifteen shillings bottle; Macready threw one weeks his dear papa's death, annoyed extremely." Whilst company thus engaged, Master MacGreedy took advantage general abstraction secure half-a-dozen crackers his share; he retired corner them, he meant pick quietly pieces himself. He wanted gay paper, motto, sweetmeats; he like report cracker. And he want, he wanted himself. "Give us cracker," said Master Jim, dreamily. The dogs, dissatisfied snorts, dropped sitting posture, lying close together rug, dreaming uttering short commenting barks whines intervals. The twins reposing lazily tutor's feet, feel disposed exert even far fetch bonbons. "There is one," said tutor, taking fresh cracker his pocket. One end red gold paper, transparent green stuff silver lines. The boys pulled it. * * * * * The report louder Jim expected. "The firing begun," he murmured, involuntarily; "steady, steady!" last words his horse, seemed moving him, fear, impatience. What red gold paper cracker scarlet gold lace his cavalry uniform. He knocked speck his sleeve, scanned distant ridge, thin line smoke floated solemnly away, keen, impatient eyes. Were stand inactive day? Presently horse erects his head. His eyes sparkle--he pricks his sensitive ears--his nostrils quiver strange delight. It trumpet! Fan farrâ! Fan farrâ! The brazen voice speaks--the horses move--the plumes wave--the helmets shine. On summer's day ride slowly, gracefully, calmly slope, Death Glory. Fan farrâ! Fan farrâ! Fan farrâ! * * * * * Of Master Tom knew nothing. The report cracker seemed echo his brain sound his ears thirty-six weary hours. The noise heavy sea beating ship's side gale. It now, he keeping midnight watch deck, gazing upon liquid green waves, which, heaving seething storm, lit phosphoric light, ship held steadily her course, poured past rate twelve knots hour silvery stream. Faster ship sail his thoughts travelled home; old times came back him, he hardly knew whether he looked phosphor-lighted sea, green gelatine paper barred silver. And tutor speak? Or voice sea-monster sounding his ears? "The spirits storm gone make report. The treasure gained sunk vessels reckoned, sea illuminated honour spoil." * * * * * The visitor took cracker held young lady. Her end white paper raised pattern; his dark-blue gelatine gold stars. It snapped, bonbon dropped them, young man got motto. It bald one-- "My heart thine. Wilt thou mine?" He ashamed show her. What could meagre? One could write hundred better couplets "standing one leg," saying is. He trying improvise one occasion, he became aware blue sky his head dark shades night, lighted stars. A brook rippled near soothing monotony. The evening wind sighed trees, wafted fragrance sweet bay-leaved willow towards him, blew stray lock hair his face. Yes! _She_ also there, walking beside him, scented willow-bushes. Where, why, whither he ask know. She him--with him; he seemed tread summer air. He doubt nature his feelings her, opportunity declaring might never occur again. Surely now, ever, he would eloquent! Thoughts poetry clothed words fire must spring unbidden his lips moment. And yet somehow he could find single word say. He beat his brains, idea would come forth. Only idiotic cracker motto, haunted meagre couplet: "My heart thine. Wilt thou mine?" Meanwhile wandered on. The precious time passing. He must least make beginning. "What fine night is!" he observed. But, oh dear! thousand times balder meagre cracker motto; another word could he find say. At moment awkward silence broken voice neighbouring copse. It nightingale singing his mate. There lack eloquence, melodious eloquence, there. The song plaintive old memories, full tenderness eyes young girl full tears. They standing still now, her graceful head bent she listening bird. He stooped his head near hers, spoke simple natural outburst almost involuntary. "Do ever think old times? Do remember old house, fun used have? tutor pelted horse-chestnuts little girl? And cracker bonbons, motto _we_ drew-- 'My heart thine. Wilt thou mine?'" She smiled, lifted her eyes ("blue sky, bright stars," he thought) his, answered "Yes." Then bonbon motto avenged, silence. Eloquent, perfect, complete, beautiful silence! Only wind sighed fragrant willows, stream rippled, stars shone, neighbouring copse nightingale sang, sang, sang. * * * * * When white end cracker came young lady's hand, she full admiration fine raised pattern. As she held her fingers suddenly struck her she discovered tutor's fragrant smoke smelt like. It like scent orange-flowers, certainly soporific effect upon senses. She felt sleepy, she stroked shiny surface cracker she found herself thinking soft paper, rousing herself start, wondering her folly speaking thus white silk she dressed, she holding skirt her finger thumb, she dancing minuet. "It is grandmamma's egg-she will brocade!" she cried. "Oh, Grandmamma! Have given me? That lovely old thing! But I thought family wedding-dress, I till I bride." "And are, dear. And fairer bride sun never shone on," sobbed old lady, kissing blessing her, wishing her, words old formula-- "Health wear it, Strength tear it, And money buy another." "There hope last two things, know," said young girl; "for I sure flag braved thousand years half strong brocade; buying another, none bought degenerate days." The old lady's reply probably gracious, she liked complimented virtues old things general, her egg-she will brocade particular. But she said her granddaughter heard nothing. With strange irregularity dreams, she found herself, she knew how, old church. It true. She bride, standing old friends old associations thick around her, threshold new life. The sun shone stained glass windows, illuminated brocade, whose old-fashioned stiffness became her childish beauty, flung thousand new tints her sunny hair, drew powerful fragrance orange-blossom twined, almost overpowering. Yes! It sweet--too strong. She certainly would able bear much longer without losing her senses. And service going on. A question asked her, she must reply. She made strong effort, said "Yes," simply earnestly, she meant. But she sooner said she became uneasily conscious she used right words. Some one laughed. It tutor, his voice jarred disturbed dream, stone troubles surface still water. The vision trembled, broke, young lady found herself still sitting table fingering cracker paper, whilst tutor chuckled rubbed his hands fire, his shadow scrambled wall like ape upon tree. But her "Yes" passed young man's dream without disturbing it, he dreamt on. It cracker like preceding one grandmother parson pulled together. The old lady insisted upon it. The good rector shown tendency low spirits evening, wish withdraw early. But old lady approve people "shirking" (as boys say) either duties pleasures; keep "merry Christmas" family circle spared meet health happiness, seemed her one other. It his sermon next day weighed parson's mind. Not he behindhand part his duties. He far methodical his habits that, written bustle Christmas week began. But preaching Christmas sermons pulpit thirty-five years, he felt keenly difficult awaken due interest subjects familiar, give new force lessons often repeated. So he wanted quiet hour his study he went rest, sermon satisfy him, subject heart-stirring ever-new,--the Story Bethlehem. He consented, however, pull one cracker grandmother, though he feared noise might startle her nerves, said so. "Nerves invented young days," said old lady, firmly; she took her part ensuing explosion without much wink. As cracker snapped, seemed parson fragrant smoke yule log growing denser room. Through mist time time face tutor loomed large, disappeared. At last clouds rolled away, parson breathed clear air. Clear, yes, clear! This brilliant freshness, intense lights shadows, mildness purity night air-- "It England," he muttered, "it East. I felt air like since I breathed air Palestine." Over his head, immeasurable distances, dark blue space lighted great multitude stars, whose glittering ranks atmosphere distinctness glory unseen us. Perhaps scene beauty visible creation proved hackneyed theme poet philosopher starry night. But superabundance simile moral illustration subject loaded rob beholder freshness grandeur force teaching; noblest majestic vision handiwork GOD eye man permitted rest. As parson gazed he became conscious he alone. Other eyes besides his watching skies to-night. Dark, profound, patient, Eastern eyes, used cradle grave watch wait. The eyes star-gazers dream-interpreters; men believed fate empires written shining characters face heaven, "Mene, Mene," written fire walls Babylonian palace. The old parson one many men real learning wide reading pursue studies quiet country parishes England, keen interest intelligence he watched group figures lay near him. "Is vision past?" he asked himself. "There doubt men. They star-gazers, magi, and, dress bearing, men high rank; perhaps 'teachers higher wisdom' one purest philosophies old heathen world. When one thinks," he pursued, "of intense interest, eager excitement student history finds narrative past unfolded dusty records written hand man, one may realize absorbing must science professed unveil future, display eyes wise fate dynasties written finger GOD amid stars." The dark-robed figures still might almost carved stone. The air seemed grow purer purer; stars shone brighter brighter; suspended ether planets seemed hang like lamps. Now shooting meteor passed athwart sky, vanished behind hill. But watchers move; silence watched on--till, sudden, whence parson knew not, across shining ranks immeasurable host, whose names number known GOD alone, passed slow obvious motion one brilliant solitary star--a star surpassing brightness he involuntarily joined wild cry joy greeting Men East prostrated faces earth. He could understand language which, noisy clamour gesticulation, broke former profound patient silence, greeted portent watched. But he knew Wise Men Epiphany, Star Bethlehem. In his ears rang energetic simplicity Gospel narrative, "When saw Star, rejoiced exceeding great joy." With exceeding great joy! Ah! happy magi, (more blest Balaam son Beor) faithful dim light vouchsafed you; Gentile Church may well proud memory. Ye travelled long far bring royal offerings King Jews, faith found Israel. Ye saw Him prophets kings desired see, glad. Wise men indeed, wise highest wisdom, ye suffered taught GOD. Then parson prayed indeed dream he might dream on; might pass, vision, hill, following footsteps magi, whilst Star went them, till he see rest city, which, little indeed among thousands Judah, yet birthplace Lord's Christ. "Ah!" he almost sobbed, "let follow! On knees let follow house see Holy Child. In eyes many babies I seen mind thought far beyond powers communication, every mother knows. But times, sort awe, one sees immortal soul shining prison-bars helpless infancy, what, oh! must behold GOD-head veiled flesh face little child!" The parson stretched his arms, even passion his words vision began break. He dared move fear utterly fade, he lay still silent, wise men roused followers, and, led Star, train passed solemnly distant hills. Then clear night became clouded fragrant vapour, sigh parson awoke. * * * * * When cracker snapped white end left grandmother's hand, she astonished perceive (as she thought) white lace veil she worn her wedding bonnet still her possession, she turning her fingers. "I fancied I gave Jemima her first baby born," she muttered dreamily. It darned yellow, carried her back same, recalled happy hours wonderful vividness. She remembered post-chaise postillion. "He pert little fellow, laughed him! He must either dead shaky old man now," said old lady. She seemed smell scent meadow-sweet powerful lane drove; clearly she could see clean little country inn spent honeymoon! She seemed now, taking her bonnet shawl, quaint clean chamber, heavy oak rafters, jasmine coming window, glancing pardonable pride fair face reflected mirror. But she laid her things patchwork coverlet, seemed her lace veil became fine white linen, folded figure lay bed; she looked round room everything draped white--white blinds hung windows, even old oak chest press covered clean white cloths, decent custom country; whilst church tower without passing bell tolled slowly. She seen face corpse, strange anxiety came her count strokes bell, tell man, woman, child passed away. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven! No more. It woman, she looked face dead she saw her own. But even she looked fair linen grave-clothes became buoyant drapery another figure, whose face she found strange recognition lineaments dead loveliness bride. But ah! more, much more! On face beauty doomed wither, happy eyes lay future unshadowed imperfections earthly prospects, folds robe white fuller earth white them. The window curtain parted, jasmine flowers bowed heads, spirit passed chamber death, old lady's dream ended. * * * * * Miss Letitia shared cracker widow. The widow squeaked cracker went off, insisted upon giving smart paper everything Miss Letitia. She always given everything Mr. Jones, she Master MacGreedy, quite unaccustomed keep anything her share. She give explanation herself, was. The cracker thus fell hands Miss Letitia one new-fashioned ones paper pattern article dress wrapped instead bonbon. This one paper bonnet made latest _mode_--of green tissue-paper; Miss Letitia stuck top her chignon, air widow envied bottom her heart. She gift "carrying off" her clothes. But tutor, contrary, seemed afford extreme amusement; Miss Letitia bowed gracefully hither thither energy her conversation widow, green paper fluttering emphasis, he fairly shook delight, his shadow dancing like maniac beside him. He scattered powder coals, may smoke got her eyes, confused her ideas colour, Miss Letitia struck fervid otherwise unaccountable admiration paper ends cracker, unusually ugly. One sallowish salmon-colour, transparent, brick-red paper fringe. As Miss Letitia turned over, she saw, her unspeakable delight, several yards material, her peculiar genius instantly seized upon fact present rage double skirts might enough two kinds combine fashionable dress. It never struck her dirty salmon went well brick-red. "They blend becomingly, dear," she murmured; "and I think under-skirt sit well, stiff." The widow reply. The fumes tutor's compound made her sleepy, though she nodded Miss Letitia's observations, less appreciation force, inability hold her head. She dreaming uneasy, horrible dreams, like nightmares; time time mingled expressions doubt dissatisfaction fell Miss Letitia's lips. "Just half-a-yard short--no gores--false hem," (and melancholy reflection that) "flounces take much stuff." Then tutor's face kept appearing vanishing horrible grimaces mist. At last widow fell fairly asleep, dreamed she married Blue Beard nursery annals, his return his memorable journey he caught her act displaying mysterious cupboard Miss Letitia. As he waved his scimitar her head, he seemed unaccountably assume form features tutor. In her agitation poor woman could think plea his severity, except cupboard already crammed corpses his previous wives, room her. She pleading argument Miss Letitia's voice broke upon her dream decisive accent: "There is enough two bodies." The widow shrieked awoke. "High low," explained Miss Letitia. "My dear, _are_ screaming about?" "I sorry indeed," said widow; "I beg pardon, I am sure, thousand times. But since Mr. Jones's death I nervous, I horrible dream. And, oh dear! oh dear!" she added, "what matter precious child? Macready, love, come mamma, pretty lamb." Ugh! ugh! There groans corner Master MacGreedy sat his crackers eggs, he hatching them. He touched one, yet, stock he secured. He picked pieces, avoided snap, found large comfit like egg rough she will inside. Every one knows goodies crackers superior quality. There large amount white lead outside thinly disguised shabby flavour sugar. But outside disposed of, lies almond core. Now almond delicious thing itself, doubly nice takes taste white paint chalk one's mouth. But spite white lead sugar chalk he sucked his way, MacGreedy could come almond. A dozen times he point spitting delusive sweetmeat; he thought he sure feel bit hard rough edge, thinking he gained kernel last, he held valiantly on. It proved rough bit sugar, however, still interminable coating melted copiously his mouth; still clean, fragrant almond evaded his hopes. At last groan he spat seemingly undiminished bonbon floor, turned white trembling arrowroot blanc-mange. In obedience widow's entreaties tutor opened window, tried carry MacGreedy air; young gentleman utterly refused allow tutor approach him, borne howling bed his mamma. With fresh air fumes fragrant smoke dispersed, company roused themselves. "Rather oppressive, eh?" said master house, his dream too, concern. The dogs also, testified sleep low growls whines. Now shook themselves, rubbed other, growling warlike manner teeth, wagging peaceably little stumpy tails. The twins shook themselves, fell squabbling whether sleep no; and, either, given way weakness. Miss Letitia took paper bonnet her head nervous laugh, looking regretfully cracker papers put her pocket. The parson went home frosty night. In village street he heard boy's voice singing two lines Christian hymn-- "Trace Babe Who hath redeemed loss From poor Manger bitter Cross;" his eyes filled tears. The old lady went bed slept peace. "In thirty-five years privileged hear you, sir," she told rector next day service, "I never heard Christmas sermon before." The visitor carefully preserved blue paper cracker motto. He came early next morning find white half put them. He find it, young lady taken night before. The tutor room him, wandering round scene evening's festivities. The yule log lay black cold upon hearth, tutor nodded it. "I told would be," he said; "but never mind, day, merry one too." In corner lay heap crackers Master MacGreedy ill remember he retired. The tutor pocketed grim smile. As comfit, eaten one dogs, come earliest all. He swallowed whole, whether contained almond not, remains mystery present time. * * * * * AMELIA AND THE DWARFS. My godmother's grandmother knew good deal fairies. _Her_ grandmother seen fairy rade Roodmas Eve, she herself could remember copper vessel queer shape left elves occasion old farm-house among hills, The following story came her, she got I know. She used say pleasant tale, good moral inside it. My godmother often observed tale without moral like nut without kernel; worth cracking. (We called fire-side stories "cracks" part country.) This tale. AMELIA. A couple gentlefolk lived certain part England. (My godmother never would tell name either place people, even she knew it. She said one ought expose one's neighbours' failings due occasion for.) They child, daughter, whose name Amelia. They easy-going, good-humoured couple; "rather soft," godmother said, she apt think anybody "soft" came southern shires, people did. Amelia, born farther north, means so. She strong resolute will, clever head her own, though she child. She way her too, completely. Perhaps she child, perhaps easy-going, her parents spoiled her. She was, beyond question, tiresome little girl neighbourhood. From her baby days her father mother taken every opportunity showing her friends, friend dread infliction. When good lady visited her acquaintances, she always took Amelia her, acquaintances fortunate enough see windows coming, used snatch delicate knick-knacks, brittle ornaments lying about, put away, crying, "What done? Here comes Amelia!" When Amelia came in, she would stand survey room, whilst her mother saluted her acquaintance; anything struck her fancy, she would interrupt greetings draw her mother's attention it, twitch her shawl, "Oh, look, Mamma, funny bird glass case!" perhaps, "Mamma, Mamma! There is new carpet since last;" for, her mother said, she "a observing child." Then she would wander round room, examining fingering everything, occasionally coming back something her hand tread her mother's dress, break upon ladies' conversation with--"Mamma! Mamma! What is good keeping old basin? It is broken mended, pieces quite loose now. I feel them:" or--addressing lady house--"That is real ottoman corner. It is box covered chintz. I know, I have looked." Then her mamma would say, reprovingly, "My _dear_ Amelia!" And perhaps lady house would beg, "Do not play old china, love; though mended, valuable;" her mother would add, "My dear Amelia, must not." Sometimes good lady said, "You _must_ not." Sometimes she tried--"You must _not_" When failed, Amelia balancing china bowl her finger-ends, her mamma would get flurried, Amelia flurried her, she always rolled her r's, emphasized her words, sounded thus: "My dear-r-r-r-Ramelia! You must not." At Amelia would much look round, till perhaps bowl slipped her fingers, smashed unmendable fragments. Then her mamma would exclaim, "Oh, dear-r-r-r, oh, dear-r-Ramelia" lady house would try look matter, Amelia her mother departed, would pick bits, pour her complaints her lady friends, suffered many damages hands "very observing child." When good couple received friends home, escaping Amelia. If dinner-party, she came dessert, perhaps sooner. She would take her position near one, generally person deeply engaged conversation, either lean heavily her, climb his her knee, without invited. She would break upon interesting discussion her little childish affairs, following style--"I have to-day. I walked town. I jumped across three brooks. Can jump? Papa gave sixpence to-day. I saving money rich. You may cut orange; no, I will take Mr. Brown, he peels spoon turns skin back. Mr. Brown! Mr. Brown! Do not talk Mamma, peel orange, please. Mr. Brown! I am playing finger-glass." And finger-glass full cold water upset Mr. Brown's shirt-front, Amelia's mamma would cry--"Oh dear, oh dear-r-Ramelia!" carry her ladies drawing-room. Here she would scramble ladies' knees, trample gathers dresses, fidget ornaments, startling luckless lady announcement, "I have got bracelet undone last!" would find one divisions broken open force, Amelia understanding working clasp. Or perhaps two young lady friends would get quiet corner chat. The observing child would sure spy them, run them, crushing flowers ribbons, crying--"You two want talk secrets, I know. I hear say. I am going listen, I am. And I shall tell, too;" perhaps knock door announced Nurse take Miss Amelia bed, spread general rapture relief. Then Amelia would run trample worry her mother, much teasing, clinging, complaining, Nurse would dismissed, fond mamma would turn lady next her, say smile--"I suppose I must let her stay little. It treat her, poor child!" But treat visitors. Besides tormenting her fellow-creatures, Amelia trick teasing animals. She really fond dogs, she still fonder she wanted do, worrying everything everybody her. So she used tread tips tails, pretend give biscuit, hit nose, besides pulling few, long, sensitive hairs thin-skinned dogs wear upper lip. Now Amelia's mother's acquaintances well-bred amiable, never spoke minds either mother daughter endured latter's rudeness, wilfulness, powers destruction. But case dogs, expressed sentiments many growl snap. At last one day Amelia tormenting snow-white bulldog (who certainly well-bred amiable living creature kingdom), she see even his patience becoming worn out. His pink nose became crimson increased irritation, his upper lip twitched his teeth, behind he rolling many warning R's Amelia's mother herself. She finally held bun towards him, he take it, she snatched away kicked instead. This fairly exasperated bulldog, Amelia would let bite bun, he bit Amelia's leg. Her mamma distressed she fell hysterics, hardly knew she saying. She said bulldog must shot fear he go mad, Amelia's wound must done red-hot poker fear _she_ go mad (with hydrophobia). And course she could not bear pain this, she must chloroform, she would probably die that; one several thousands dies annually chloroform, evident her chance life small indeed. So, poor lady said, "Whether shoot Amelia burn bulldog--at least I mean shoot bulldog burn Amelia red-hot poker--or leave alone; whether Amelia bulldog chloroform bears without--it seems death madness every way!" And doctor come fast enough, she ran without her bonnet meet him, Amelia's papa, much distressed too, ran her her bonnet. Meanwhile doctor came another way, found Amelia sitting dining-room floor bulldog, crying bitterly. She telling wanted shoot him, not, her fault his. But she tell she burnt red-hot poker, she thought might hurt his feelings. And she wept afresh, kissed bulldog, bulldog kissed her his red tongue, rubbed his pink nose her, beat his tail much harder floor Amelia ever hit it. She said things doctor, she told also she willing burnt without chloroform must done, would spare bulldog. And though she looked white, she meant she said. But doctor looked her leg, found snap, deep wound; he looked bulldog, saw far looking mad, he looked great deal sensible anybody house. So he washed Amelia's leg bound up, she burnt poker, neither she get hydrophobia; she got good lesson manners, thenceforward she always behaved utmost propriety animals, though she tormented her mother's friends much ever. Now although Amelia's mamma's acquaintances polite complain her face, made said behind her back. In allusion poor lady's ineffectual remonstrances, one gentleman said mischief Amelia did, dearer she seemed grow her mother. And somebody else replied however dear she might daughter, she certainly _dear_ friend, proposed send bill damages she done course year, round robin her parents Christmas. From may seen Amelia popular her parents' friends, (to grown-up people justice) good children almost invariably are. If she favourite drawing-room, she still less nursery, where, besides hardships naturally belonging attendance spoilt child, poor Nurse kept, she said, "on continual go" Amelia's reckless destruction her clothes. It fair wear tear, occasional fall mire, accidental rent two game "Hunt Hare," constant wilful destruction, Nurse repair best she might. No entreaties would induce Amelia "take care" anything. She walked obstinately muddy side road Nurse pointed clean parts, kicking dirt her feet; she climbed wall she never tried free her dress caught; she rushed, half skirt might left behind care she matter. "They must mended," "They must washed," she thought it. "You seem think things clean mend themselves, Miss Amelia," said poor Nurse one day. "No, I do not," said Amelia, rudely. "I think them; for?" But though she spoke insolent unlady-like fashion, Amelia really realize tasks her carelessness imposed people. When every hour Nurse's day spent struggling keep her wilful young lady regularly fed, decently dressed, moderately well behaved (except, indeed, hours her mother fighting battle down-stairs); last, hardest struggle all, she got bed two hours later her appointed time, even rest Nurse. Amelia's mamma could last lean back her chair quiet chat her husband, broken upon every two minutes, Amelia herself asleep; Nurse must sit hours wearing her eyes light tallow candle, fine-darning great, jagged, unnecessary holes Amelia's muslin dresses. Or perhaps she wash iron clothes Amelia's wear next day. For sometimes she destructive, towards end week she used her clothes clean ones fall back upon. Amelia's meals another source trouble. She would wear pinafore; put on, she would burst strings, perhaps throwing away knock her plate mutton broth tablecloth her dress. Then she fancied first one thing another; she like that; she wanted bit cut there. Her mamma used begin saying, "My dear-r-Ramelia, must wasteful," she used end saying, "The dear child positively appetite;" seemed good reason wasting food upon her; Amelia's mamma meant she might try little cutlet tomato sauce she half finished her roast beef, cutlet mashed potato might exchanged plum tart custard; she spooned custard played paste, put plum stones tablecloth, she might tempted little Stilton cheese celery, exchange anything caught her fancy dessert dishes. The Nurse used say, "Many poor child would thank GOD waste every meal-time, Miss Amelia," quote certain good old saying, "Waste not, want not." But Amelia's mamma allowed her send away her plates would fed another child, day day. UNDER THE HAYCOCKS. It summer, haytime. Amelia constantly hayfield, haymakers constantly wished she anywhere else. She mislaid rakes, nearly killed herself several persons fork, overturned one haycock another fast made. At tea-time hoped she would depart, she teased her mamma tea brought field, her mamma said, "The poor child must treat sometimes," brought out. After she fell haycart, good deal shaken, hurt. So she taken indoors, haymakers worked hard cleared field, cocks left till morning. The sun set, dew fell, moon rose. It lovely night. Amelia peeped behind blinds drawing-room windows, saw four haycocks, deep shadow reposing side. The rest field swept clean, looked pale moonshine. It lovely night. "I want go out," said Amelia. "They take away cocks I get morning, jumping tumbling, I shall go fun now." "My dear Amelia, must not," said her mamma; her papa added, "I will not hear it." So Amelia went up-stairs grumble Nurse; Nurse said, "Now, dear Miss Amelia, go quietly bed, like dear love. The field wet dew. Besides, it is moonlight night, knows what is abroad? You might see fairies--bless us sain us!--and not. There is magpie hopping near house day, that is sign ill-luck." "I do not care magpies," said Amelia; "I threw stone one to-day." And she left nursery, swung down-stairs rail banisters. But she go drawing-room; she opened front door went moonshine. It lovely night. But something strange it. Everything looked asleep, yet seemed awake watching. There sound, yet air seemed full half-sounds. The child quite alone, yet every step she fancied one behind her, one side her, somewhere, found rustling leaf passing shadow. She soon hayfield, same; she fancied something green moving near first haycock she thought little it, till, coming closer, she plainly perceived moonlight tiny man dressed green, tall, pointed hat, very, long tips his shoes, tying his shoestring his foot stubble stalk. He wizened faces, he got angry his shoe, he pulled wry grimace quite laughable. At last he stood up, stepping carefully stubble, went first haycock, drawing hollow grass stalk blew upon till his cheeks puffed like footballs. And yet sound, half-sound, horn blown far distance, dream. Presently point tall hat, finally another little wizened face, poked side haycock. "Can hold revel to-night?" asked little green man. "That indeed cannot," answered other; "we hardly room turn round is, Amelia's dirty frocks." "Ah, bah!" said dwarf; he walked next haycock, Amelia cautiously following. Here he blew again, head put before; he said, "Can hold revel to-night?" "How possible," reply, "when place one much set acorn cup, Amelia's broken victuals?" "Fie! fie!" said dwarf, went third, happened before; he asked old question, "Can hold revel to-night?" "Can dance glass crockery sherds?" inquired other. "Amelia's broken gimcracks everywhere." "Pshaw!" snorted dwarf, frowning terribly; he came fourth haycock he blew angry blast grass stalk split seven pieces. But he met better success before. Only point hat came hay, feeble voice piped tones depression--"The broken threads would entangle feet. It is Amelia's fault. If could get hold her!" "If she is wise, she will keep far haycocks she can," snarled dwarf, angrily; he shook his fist much say, "If she come, I receive her pleasantly." Now Amelia, hear she better something, make her wish it; she wanting courage, she pulled dwarf's little cloak, she would twitched her mother's shawl, said (with sort snarly whine spoilt children generally speak)--"Why should not I come haycocks I want to? They belong papa, I shall come I like. But business here." "Nightshade hemlock!" ejaculated little man, "you lacking impudence. Perhaps Sauciness quite aware things distributed world?" saying he lifted his pointed shoes began dance sing, "All sun belongs men, And moon fairies. So, so, so! Ho, ho, ho! All moon fairies." As he sang "Ho, ho, ho!" little man turned head heels; though time Amelia would gladly got away, she could not, dwarf seemed dance tumble round her, always cut chance escape; whilst numberless voices around seemed join chorus, "So, so, so! Ho, ho, ho! All moon fairies." "And now," said little man, "to work! And plenty work you, trip on, first haycock." "I shall not!" said Amelia. "On you!" repeated dwarf. "I will not!" said Amelia. But little man, behind her, pinched her funny-bone his lean fingers, and, everybody knows, agony; Amelia ran on, tried get away. But she went fast, dwarf trod her heels his long-pointed shoe, she go fast enough, he pinched her funny-bone. So her life she obliged she told. As ran, tall hats wizened faces popped sides haycocks, like blanched almonds tipsy cake; whenever dwarf pinched Amelia, trod her heels, goblins cried "Ho, ho, ho!" horrible contortions laughed, hideous behold them. "Here Amelia!" shouted dwarf reached first haycock. "Ho, ho, ho!" laughed others, poked hay. "Bring stock," said dwarf; hay lifted, ran six seven dwarfs, carrying seemed Amelia little girl like herself. And she looked closer, her horror surprise figure exactly like her--it her face, clothes, everything. "Shall kick house?" asked goblins. "No," said dwarf; "lay haycock. The father mother coming seek her now." When Amelia heard she began shriek help; she pushed haycock, her loudest cries sounded like chirruping grasshopper. It really fine sight see inside cock. Farmers like see flowers hayfield, fairies do. They arranged buttercups, &c., patterns haywalls; bunches meadow-sweet swung roof like censers, perfumed air; ox-eye daisies formed ceiling gave light like stars. But Amelia cared none this. She struggled peep hay, she see her father mother nurse come lawn, followed servants, looking her. When saw stock ran raise exclamations pity surprise. The stock moaned faintly, Amelia's mamma wept, Amelia herself shouted her might. "What is that?" said her mamma. (It easy deceive mother.) "Only grasshoppers, dear," said Papa. "Let us get poor child home." The stock moaned again, mother said, "Oh dear! oh dear-r-Ramelia!" followed tears. "Rub her eyes," said dwarf; Amelia's eyes rubbed ointment, she took last peep, she could see stock nothing hairy imp, face like oldest grotesque apes. "--and send her below," added dwarf. On field opened, Amelia pushed underground. She found herself sort open heath, houses seen. Of course moonshine, yet neither daylight dark. There light early dawn, every sound clear dreamy, like first sounds day coming fresh air sunrise. Beautiful flowers crept heath, whose tints constantly changing subdued light; hues changed blended, flowers gave forth different perfumes. All would charming every paces paths blocked large clothes-baskets full dirty frocks, And frocks Amelia's. Torn, draggled, wet, covered sand, mud, dirt kinds, Amelia recognized them. "You have got wash all," said dwarf, behind her usual; "that is you have come for--not society particularly pleasant. So sooner begin better." "I cannot," said Amelia (she already learnt "I will not" answer every one); "send Nurse, she will them. It her business." "What Nurse she done, it is time begin," said dwarf. "Sooner later mischief done spoilt children's wilful disobedience comes back hands. Up certain point help them, love children, wilful ourselves. But limits everything. If cannot wash dirty frocks, time learnt so, may know trouble impose people. _She_ teach you." The dwarf kicked his foot front him, pointed his long toe woman sat fire made upon heath, pot suspended crossed poles. It like bit gipsy encampment, woman seemed real woman, fairy--which case, Amelia afterwards found. She lived underground many years, dwarfs' servant. And came Amelia wash her dirty frocks. Let little girl try wash one her dresses; half wash it, leave stained dirty water, wash quite clean. Let her try starch iron it--in short, make look come laundress--and she idea poor Amelia learn do. There help it. When she working she seldom saw dwarfs; she idle stubborn, hopes getting away, one sure start her elbow pinch her funny-bone, poke her ribs, till she her best. Her back ached stooping wash-tub; her hands arms grew wrinkled soaking hot soapsuds, sore rubbing. Whatever she know do, woman heath taught her. At first, whilst Amelia sulky, woman heath sharp cross; Amelia became willing obedient, she good-natured, even helped her. The first time Amelia felt hungry she asked food. "By means," said one dwarfs; "there plenty belongs you;" he led her away till came place like first, except covered plates broken meats; bits good meat, pie, pudding, bread-and-butter, &c., Amelia wasted beforetime. "I cannot eat cold scraps like these," said Amelia, turning away. "Then ask food hungry?" screamed dwarf, he pinched her sent her her business. After she became famished she glad beg humbly allowed go food; she ate cold chop remains rice pudding thankfulness. How delicious tasted! She surprised herself good things she rejected. After time she fancied she would like warm cold meat pan, woman heath used cook her dinner in, she asked leave so. "You may anything like make comfortable, yourself," said she; Amelia, watching her many times, became quite expert cooking scraps. As real daylight underground, also night. When old woman tired she lay nap, she thought Amelia earned rest, she allowed her same. It never cold, never rained, slept heath among flowers. They say "It is long lane turning," hardest tasks come end time, Amelia's dresses clean last; wearisome work her. They mended. Amelia looked jagged rents made hedges; great gaping holes front she put her foot through; torn tucks gathers. First she wept, she bitterly regretted she often refused her sewing home she awkward her needle. Whether she ever would got task alone doubtful, she time become well-behaved willing old woman kind her, and, pitying her blundering attempts, she helped her great deal; whilst Amelia would cook old woman's victuals, repeat stories pieces poetry amuse her. "How glad I I ever learnt anything!" thought poor child: "everything one learns seems come useful time." At last dresses finished. "Do think I shall allowed go home now?" Amelia asked woman heath. "Not yet," said she; "you got mend broken gimcracks next." "But I done tasks," Amelia said; "will let go then?" "That depends," said woman, she sat silent fire; Amelia wept bitterly, she pitied her said--"Only dry eyes, fairies hate tears, I tell I know best I can. You see, first came were--excuse me!--such unlicked cub; peevish, selfish, wilful, useless, ill-mannered little miss, neither fairies anybody else likely keep longer necessary. But willing, handy, civil little thing, pretty graceful withal, I think likely want keep altogether. I think better make mind it. They kindly little folk, make pet end." "Oh, no! no!" moaned poor Amelia; "I want mother, poor dear mother! I want make bad child long. Besides, surely 'stock,' called her, want come back her people." "As that," said woman, "after time stock affect mortal illness, take possession first black cat she sees, shape leave house, come home. But figure like remain lifeless bed, duly buried. Then people, believing dead, never look you, always remain here. However, distresses so, I give advice. Can dance?" "Yes," said Amelia; "I attend pretty well dancing lessons. I considered rather clever it." "At spare moments find," continued woman, "dance, dance dances, well can. The dwarfs love dancing." "And then?" said Amelia. "Then, perhaps night take dance meadows above-ground." "But I could get away. They would tread heels--oh! I could never escape them." "I know that," said woman; "your chance this. If ever, dancing meadows, find four-leaved clover, hold hand, wish home. Then one stop you. Meanwhile I advise seem happy, may think content, forgotten world. And dance, all, dance!" And Amelia, behindhand, began dance pretty figures heath. As she dancing dwarf came by. "Ho, ho!" said he, "you dance, you?" "When I happy I can," said Amelia, performing several graceful movements she spoke. "What pleased now?" snapped dwarf, suspiciously. "Have I reason?" said Amelia. "The dresses washed mended." "Then them!" returned dwarf. On half-a-dozen elves popped whole lot big basket kicked world, found way right wardrobes somehow. As woman heath said, Amelia soon set new task. When she bade old woman farewell, she asked she could nothing her ever she got liberty herself. "Can I nothing get back old home?" Amelia cried, she thought others well herself. "No, thank you," returned old woman; "I used this, care return. I long time--how long I know; neither daylight dark measure time--long, I sure, long. The light noise yonder would much me. But I wish well, and, all, remember dance!" The new scene Amelia's labours rocky part heath, grey granite boulders served seats tables, sometimes workshops anvils, one place, grotesque grimy old dwarf sat forging rivets mend china glass. A fire hollow boulder served forge, flatter part his anvil. The rocks covered directions knick-knacks, ornaments, &c., Amelia various times destroyed. "If please, sir," she said dwarf, "I Amelia." The dwarf left blowing his forge looked her. "Then I wonder you are ashamed yourself," said he. "I ashamed myself," said poor Amelia, "very much ashamed. I like mend things I can." "Well, cannot say that," said dwarf, mollified tone, he kindly little creature; "bring china bowl here, I will show set work." Poor Amelia get fast, she tried her best. As dwarf, truly wonderful see he worked. Things seemed mend his touch, he proud his skill, particular, he generally things Amelia done her fashion. The first time he gave her minutes rest amuse herself, she held her little skirt, began one her prettiest dances. "Rivets trivets!" shrieked little man, "how dance! It charming! I say charming! On you! Fa, la fa! La, fa la! It gives fidgets shoe-points see you!" forthwith he jumped, began capering about. "I good dancer myself," said little man. "Do know 'Hop, Skip, Jump' dance?" "I think I do," said Amelia. "It much admired," said dwarf, "when I dance it;" he thereupon tucked little leathern apron he worked, performed curious antics one leg. "That Hop," he observed, pausing moment. "The Skip thus. You throw left leg high far can, drop toe left foot fling right leg manner, on. This Jump," he turned somersault disappeared view. When Amelia next saw he sitting cross-legged his boulder. "Good, was not it?" he said. "Wonderful!" Amelia replied. "Now it is turn again," said dwarf. But Amelia cunningly replied--"I am afraid I must go work." "Pshaw!" said little tinker. "Give work. I minute month, better boot. Now dance again." "Do know this?" said Amelia, she danced paces polka mazurka. "Admirable!" cried little man. "Stay"--and he drew old violin behind rock; "now dance again, mark time well, I may catch measure, I accompany you." Which accordingly he did, improvising spirited tune, had, however, peculiar subdued weird effect sounds strange region. "The fiddle came yonder," said little man. "It smashed atoms world thrown away. But, ho, ho, ho! nothing I cannot mend, mended fiddle amended fiddle. It improves tone. Now teach dance, I patch rest gimcracks. Is bargain?" "By means," said Amelia; she began explain dance best her ability. "Charming, charming!" cried dwarf. "We dance ourselves. We dance hand hand, round round, dance together. Now I learn step, I put arm round waist dance you." Amelia looked dwarf. He smutty, old, wizened. Truly, queer partner! But "handsome handsome does;" he done her good turn. So he learnt step, he put his arm round Amelia's waist, danced together. His shoe-points much way, otherwise he danced well. Then he set work broken ornaments, soon "as good new." But kicked world, for, dwarfs said, would sure break road. So kept used them; I fear benefit came little tinker's skill Amelia's mamma's acquaintance matter. "Have I tasks?" Amelia inquired. "One more," said dwarfs; she led farther smooth mossy green, thickly covered looked like bits broken thread. One would think milliner's work-room first invention needles thread. "What these?" Amelia asked. "They broken threads conversations interrupted," reply; "and pretty dangerous work dance now, threads getting round one's shoe-points. Dance hornpipe herring-net, you will know is!" Amelia began pick threads, tedious work. She cleared yard two, her back aching terribly, she heard fiddle mazurka behind her; looking round she saw old dwarf, playing away, making hideous grimaces his chin pressed violin. "Dance, lady, dance!" he shouted. "I think I can," said Amelia; "I weary stooping work." "Then rest minutes," he answered, "and I play jig. A jig beautiful dance, life, spirit! So!" And he played faster faster, his arm, his face, his fiddle-bow seemed working together; he played, threads danced three heaps. "That bad, it?" said dwarf; "and dance," he played mazurka. "Get measure well head. Lá, la fá lâ! lâ, la fá lâ! So!" And throwing away his fiddle, he caught Amelia round waist, danced before. After which, she difficulty putting three heaps thread basket. "Where kicked to?" asked young goblins. "To four winds heaven," said old dwarf. "There drawing-room conversations worth putting together second time. They like old china bowls." BY MOONLIGHT. Thus Amelia's tasks ended; word said her return home. The dwarfs kind, made much her evident meant her remain them. Amelia often cooked them, she danced played them, never showed sign discontent; her heart ached home, she alone she would bury her face flowers cry her mother. One day she overheard dwarfs consultation. "The moon full to-morrow," said one--("Then I month here," thought Amelia; "it full moon night")--"shall dance Mary Meads?" "By means," said old tinker dwarf; "and take Amelia, dance dance." "Is safe?" said another. "Look content she is," said old dwarf; "and, oh! she dances; feet tickle bare thought." "The ordinary run mortals see us," continued objector; "but she visible one. And men women wander moonlight, Mary Meads near her old home." "I make her hat touchwood," said old dwarf, "so even she seen look like will-of-the-wisp bobbing down. If she come, I not. I must dance dance. You know is! We two alone move together grace even remarkable. But I think yonder shall attendant shadows echoing movements, I long moment arrive." "So it," said others; Amelia wore touchwood hat, went Mary Meads. Amelia dwarf danced mazurka, shadows, short themselves, long gigantic, danced beside them. As moon went down, shadows lengthened, dwarf raptures. "When one sees colossal one's shadow is," he remarked, "one knows one's true worth. You also good shadow. We partners dance, I think partners life. But I fully considered matter, regarded formal proposal." And he continued dance, singing, "Lâ, la, fá, lâ, lâ, la, fá, lâ." It highly admired. The Mary Meads lay little house Amelia's parents lived, night her father, watching sick bed stock, looked window. "How lovely moonlight is!" he murmured; "but, dear me! will-of-the-wisp yonder. I idea Mary Meads damp." Then he pulled blind went back room. As poor Amelia, she found four-leaved clover, cockcrow went underground. "We dance Hunch Hill to-morrow," said dwarfs. All went before; clover plant kind Amelia see, cockcrow revel broke up. On following night danced hayfield. The old stubble almost hidden green clover. There grand fairy dance--a round dance, mean, us, dance two partners, dance join hands dance round round circle appropriate antics. Round went, faster faster, pointed shoes meeting centre like spokes wheel, kicked behind like spikes, scamper, caper, hurry! They seemed fly, suddenly ring broke one corner, nothing stronger weakest point, whole circle sent flying field. "Ho, ho, ho!" laughed dwarfs, good-humoured little folk, mind tumble. "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Amelia, she fallen her fingers four-leaved clover. She put behind her back, old tinker dwarf coming her, wiping mud his face his leathern apron. "Now dance!" he shrieked. "And I made mind--partners partners always. You incomparable. For three hundred years I met equal." But Amelia held four-leaved clover her head, cried her heart--"I want go home!" The dwarf gave hideous yell disappointment, instant stock came tumbling head heels midst, crying--"Oh! pills, powders, draughts! oh, lotions embrocations! oh, blisters, poultices, plasters! men may well short-lived!" And Amelia found herself bed her home. AT HOME AGAIN. By side Amelia's bed stood little table, many big bottles medicine, Amelia smiled think stock must swallow month past. There open Bible too, Amelia's mother reading, whilst tears trickled slowly her pale cheeks. The poor lady looked thin ill, worn sorrow watching, Amelia's heart smote her, one given her sharp blow. "Mamma, Mamma! Mother, dear, dear Mother!" The tender, humble, loving tone voice unlike Amelia's old imperious snarl, her mother hardly recognized it; she saw Amelia's eyes full intelligence instead delirium fever, (though older thinner rather pale) she looked wonderfully well, poor worn-out lady could hardly restrain herself falling hysterics joy. "Dear Mamma, I want tell it," said Amelia, kissing kind hand stroked her brow. But appeared doctor forbidden conversation; though Amelia knew would her harm, she yielded her mother's wish lay still silent. "Now, love, time take medicine." But Amelia pleaded--"Oh, Mamma, indeed I do not want medicine. I quite well, would like get up." "Ah, dear child!" cried her mother, "what I suffered inducing take medicine, yet see good done you." "I hope never suffer wilfulness," said Amelia; she swallowed two tablespoonfuls mixture labelled "To well shaken taken," without even wry face. Presently doctor came. "You are angry sight to-day, little lady, eh?" he said. "I seen long time," said Amelia; "but I know here, attending stock looked like me. If eyes touched fairy ointment, however, would aware fairy imp, ugly one, covered hair. I living terror lest go back underground shape black cat. However, thanks four-leaved clover, old woman heath, I home again." On hearing rhodomontade, Amelia's mother burst tears, she thought poor child still raving fever. But doctor smiled pleasantly, said--"Ay, ay, sure," little nod, one say, "We know it;" laid two fingers casual manner Amelia's wrist. "But she wonderfully better, madam," he said afterwards her mamma; "the brain severely tried, she marvellously improved: fact, effort nature, favourable effort, assist rally; change medicine." Which he did, wisely assisted nature bottle pure water flavoured tincture roses. "And kind give his directions poetry," said Amelia's mamma; "for I told memory, never good, seemed going completely, anxiety, I done anything wrong now, I never forgiven myself. And I always found poetry easier remember prose,"--which puzzled everybody, doctor included, till appeared she ingeniously discovered rhyme his orders-- 'To kept cool quiet, With light nourishing diet.' Under treatment Amelia soon pronounced well. She made another attempt relate her adventures, she found even Nurse would believe them. "Why told I might meet fairies," said Amelia, reproachfully. "So I did, dear," Nurse replied, "and say it is put head. And I am sure say dwarfs good printed book, though cannot think ever I would let dirty clothes store like that, let alone frocks, dear. But pity's sake, Miss Amelia, do not go mother, she thinks you will never get senses right again, she fretted enough you, poor lady; nursed night day till she nigh worn out. And anybody see you have ill, Miss, you have grown so, look paler older like. Well, sure, say, you would washing working month place without bit sun, bed lie on, scraps eat, would enough it; many's poor child to, gets worn old her time. But, dear, whatever think, give mother; you will never repent giving mother, dear, longest day live." So Amelia kept her counsel. But she one confidant. When her parents brought stock home night Amelia's visit haycocks, bulldog's conduct strange. His usual good-humour appeared exchanged incomprehensible fury, he difficulty prevented flying stock, her part showed anger dislike fully equal his. Finally bulldog confined stable, he remained whole month, uttering time time howls, his snub nose air, poor Nurse quite gave hope Amelia's recovery. "For indeed, dear, say howling dog sign death, I could abear." But day Amelia's return, Nurse leaving room tray carried light nourishing diet ordered doctor, she knocked down, tray all, bulldog, came tearing room, dragging chain dirty rope him, nearly choked desperate efforts finally effected his escape stable. And he jumped straight end Amelia's bed, he lay, _thudding_ his tail, giving short whines ecstasy. And Amelia begged he might left, evident he would bite one tried take away, he became established chief nurse. When Amelia's meals brought bedside tray, he kept fixed eye plates, see her appetite improving. And he would even take snack himself, air great affability. And Amelia told her story, she could see his eyes, his nose, his ears, his tail, way he growled whenever stock mentioned, he knew it. As, hand, he difficulty conveying her sympathetic whines sentiment, "Of course I would helped I could; tied up, disgusting old rope taken month worry through." So, spite past, Amelia grew good gentle, unselfish considerate others. She unusually clever, "Little People" said always be. And she became popular her mother's acquaintances said--"We longer call her Amelia, name learnt dislike, call her Amy, say, 'Beloved.'" * * * * * "And godmother's grandmother believe Amelia really fairies, she think fever ravings?" "That, indeed, she never said, she always observed pleasant tale good moral, surely enough anybody." THE END.
