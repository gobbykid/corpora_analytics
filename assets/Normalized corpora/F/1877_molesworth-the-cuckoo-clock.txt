 THE CUCKOO CLOCK "Now, little folks, like girls boys, Loved fairy tales even better toys. * * * * * And knew flowers spray Tiny spirits hidden away, That frisk night forest green, When earth bathed dewy sheen-- And shining halls pearl gem, The Regions Fancy--were open them." "... little child guided towards true paradise fairy dreams bliss."--E. A. Abbott. I THE OLD HOUSE "Somewhat back village street Stands old-fashioned country seat." Once upon time old town, old street, stood old house. Such house could hardly find nowadays, however searched, belonged gone-by time--a time quite passed away. It stood street, yet like town house, though front opened right pavement, back windows looked upon beautiful, quaintly terraced garden, old trees growing thick close together summer like living edge forest near them; even winter web interlaced branches hid clear view behind. There colony rooks old garden. Year year held parliaments cawed chattered fussed; year year built nests hatched eggs; year year, I _suppose_, old ones gradually died young ones took place, though, knowing _must_ so, one would suspected it, appearance rooks always same--ever always same. Time indeed seemed stand still old house, people inhabited got _so_ old could get older, outlived possibility change. But one day last come change. Late dusk autumn afternoon carriage drove door old house, came rattling stones sudden noisy clatter sounded quite impertinent, startling rooks composing rest, setting wondering could matter. A little girl matter! A little girl grey merino frock, grey beaver bonnet, grey tippet grey gloves--all grey together, even her eyes, except her round rosy face bright brown hair. Her name even rather grey, Griselda. A gentleman lifted her carriage disappeared her house, later evening gentleman came house got carriage come back again, drove away. That rooks saw change come old house. Shall go inside see more? Up shallow, wide, old-fashioned staircase, past wainscoted walls, dark shining like mirror, long narrow passage many doors, gleaming brass handles one would known there, oldest three old servants led little Griselda, tired sleepy her supper left almost untasted, room prepared her. It queer room, everything house queer; dancing light fire burning brightly tiled grate, looked cheerful enough. "I glad there is fire," said child. "Will keep alight till morning, think?" The old servant shook her head. "'Twould safe leave would burn till morning," she said. "When bed asleep, little missie, will not want fire. Bed's warmest place." "It is not I want it," said Griselda; "it is light I like it. This house looks dark me, yet seem lights hidden walls too, shine so." The old servant smiled. "It seem strange you, doubt," she said; "but you will get like it, missie. It Is _good_ old house, know best love well." "Whom mean?" said Griselda. "Do mean great-aunts?" "Ah, yes, others beside," replied old woman. "The rooks love well, others beside. Did ever hear tell 'good people,' missie, sea come from?" "Fairies, mean?" cried Griselda, her eyes sparkling. "Of course I have _heard_ them, I never saw any. Did ever?" "I could not say," answered old woman. "My mind young like yours, missie, times strange memories come back sights sounds dream. I old see hear I could. We old here, missie. It Was time something young came old house again." "How strange queer everything seems!" thought Griselda, she got bed. "I do not feel I belonged bit. And _so_ old; perhaps will not like child among them?" The thought occurred rooks! They could decide fors againsts all, settled put vote next morning, meantime Griselda went sleep. I never heard _they_ slept well night; unusual excitement hardly expected would. But Griselda, little girl rook, tired two minutes she tucked herself bed she quite sound asleep, wake several hours. "I wonder look like morning," her last waking thought. "If summer now, spring, I should not mind--there would always something nice then." As sometimes happens, she woke again, early morning, long light, her thoughts went straight subject. "If summer now, spring," she repeated herself, she asleep all--like man fell trance hundred years he saying "it bitt--" he woke finished sentence nothing happened--"erly cold." "If spring," thought Griselda. Just she got far her thoughts, she gave great start. What she heard? Could her wish come true? Was fairyland indeed she got to, one needs _wish_, _be_? She rubbed her eyes, dark see; _that_ fairyland like, her ears she felt certain deceived her: she quite, quite sure she heard cuckoo! She listened her might, she hear again. Could it, all, fancy? She grew sleepy last, dropping when--yes, again, clear distinct possible--"Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!" three, four, _five_ times, perfect silence before. "What funny cuckoo," said Griselda herself. "I could almost fancy house. I wonder great-aunts tame cuckoo cage? I do not _think_ I ever heard thing, queer house; everything seems different it--perhaps tame cuckoo. I will ask morning. It is nice hear, whatever is." And, pleasant feeling companionship, sense she living creature awake dark world, Griselda lay listening, contentedly enough, sweet, fresh notes cuckoo's friendly greeting. But sounded silent house she fast asleep. And time she slept till daylight found way _very_ darkest nooks crannies ancient dwelling. She dressed herself carefully, she warned her aunts loved neatness precision; she fastened button her grey frock, tied her hair smooth brown tangle _could_ tied down; and, absorbed weighty cares, she forgot cuckoo time. It till she sitting breakfast her aunts she remembered it, rather reminded it, little remark made friendly robins terrace walk outside. "Oh, aunt," she exclaimed, stopping short half-way journey her mouth spoonful bread milk, "have got cuckoo cage?" "A cuckoo cage," repeated her elder aunt, Miss Grizzel; "what child talking about?" "In cage!" echoed Miss Tabitha, "a cuckoo cage!" "There cuckoo somewhere house," said Griselda; "I heard night. It could not out-of-doors, could it? It would cold." The aunts looked little smile. "So like her grandmother," whispered. Then said Miss Grizzel-- "We cuckoo, dear, though is not cage, is not exactly sort cuckoo thinking of. It lives clock." "In clock," repeated Miss Tabitha, confirm her sister's statement. "In clock!" exclaimed Griselda, opening her grey eyes wide. It sounded something like three bears, speaking one other, Griselda's voice like Tiny's; loudest three. "In clock!" she exclaimed; "but cannot alive, then?" "Why not?" said Miss Grizzel. "I do not know," replied Griselda, looking puzzled. "I knew little girl once," pursued Miss Grizzel, "who quite opinion cuckoo _was_ alive, nothing would persuaded her not. Finish breakfast, dear, like shall come see cuckoo yourself." "Thank you, Aunt Grizzel," said Griselda, going her bread milk. "Yes," said Miss Tabitha, "you shall see cuckoo yourself." "Thank you, Aunt Tabitha," said Griselda. It rather bother always say "thank you," "no, thank you," twice, Griselda thought polite so, Aunt Tabitha always repeated everything Aunt Grizzel said. It would not mattered much Aunt Tabitha said _at once_ Miss Grizzel, she generally made little pause between, sometimes rather awkward. But course better say "thank you" "no, thank you" twice hurt Aunt Tabitha's feelings. After breakfast Aunt Grizzel good her word. She took Griselda several rooms house, pointing curiosities, telling histories rooms contents; Griselda liked listen, every room came to, she wondered _when_ would get room lived cuckoo. Aunt Tabitha come them, she rather rheumatic. On whole, Griselda sorry. It would taken _very_ long time, see, histories twice over, possibly, Griselda got tired, she might forgotten "thank you's" "no, thank you's" twice over. The old house looked quite queer quaint daylight seemed evening before; almost indeed, view windows added sweet, odd "old-fashionedness" everything. "We beautiful roses summer," observed Miss Grizzel, catching sight direction child's eyes wandering. "I wish summer. I love summer," said Griselda. "But rosy scent rooms even now, Aunt Grizzel, though winter, nearly winter." Miss Grizzel looked pleased. "My pot-pourri," she explained. They standing she called "great saloon," handsome old room, furnished gold-and-white chairs, must brilliant, faded yellow damask hangings. A feeling awe crept Griselda entered ancient drawing-room. What grand parties must long ago! But dancing _now_--dancing, laughing, chattering--such thing quite impossible imagine! Miss Grizzel crossed room stood one corner marvellous Chinese cabinet, black gold carving. It made shape temple, palace--Griselda sure which. Any way, delicious wonderful. At door stood, one side, two solemn mandarins; or, speak correctly, perhaps I say, mandarin his wife, right-hand figure evidently intended lady. Miss Grizzel gently touched heads. Forthwith, Griselda's astonishment, began solemnly nod. "Oh, make that, Aunt Grizzel?" she exclaimed. "Never mind, dear; would not _you_ try make nod. They would not like it," replied Miss Grizzel mysteriously. "Respect elders, dear, always remember that. The mandarins _many_ years older you--older I myself, fact." Griselda wondered, so, Miss Grizzel took liberties herself, she said nothing. "Here last summer's pot-pourri," continued Miss Grizzel, touching great china jar little stand, close beside cabinet. "You may smell it, dear." Nothing loth, Griselda buried her round little nose fragrant leaves. "It is lovely," she said. "May I smell whenever I like, Aunt Grizzel?" "We shall see," replied her aunt. "It is not _every_ little girl, know, could trust come great saloon alone." "No," said Griselda meekly. Miss Grizzel led way door opposite entered. She opened passed through, Griselda following, small ante-room. "It stroke ten," said Miss Grizzel, consulting her watch; "now, dear, shall make acquaintance cuckoo." The cuckoo "that lived clock!" Griselda gazed round her eagerly. Where clock? She could see nothing least like one, wall one corner looked like miniature house, dark brown carved wood. It _very_ like house, certainly roof--a roof deep projecting eaves; and, looking closer, yes, _was_ clock, all, figures, gilt, grown dim age, like everything else, hands little distance hardly distinguished face. Miss Grizzel stood perfectly still, looking clock; Griselda beside her, breathless expectation. Presently came sort distant rumbling. _Something_ going happen. Suddenly two little doors clock face, Griselda known there, sprang open burst flew cuckoo, flapped his wings, uttered his pretty cry, "Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!" Miss Grizzel counted aloud, "Seven, eight, nine, ten." "Yes, he never makes mistake," she added triumphantly. "All long years I never known wrong. There clocks made nowadays, I assure you, dear." "But _is_ clock? Is not he alive?" exclaimed Griselda. "He looked nodded his head, he flapped his wings went his house again--he indeed, aunt," she said earnestly; "just like saying, 'How do?' me." Again Miss Grizzel smiled, odd yet pleased smile Griselda seen her face breakfast. "Just Sybilla used say," she murmured. "Well, dear," she added aloud, "it quite right he _should_ say, 'How do?' you. It first time he seen _you_, though many year ago he knew dear grandmother, father, too, he little boy. You find good friend, one teach many lessons." "What, Aunt Grizzel?" inquired Griselda, looking puzzled. "Punctuality, one thing, faithful discharge duty," replied Miss Grizzel. "May I come see cuckoo--to watch coming out, sometimes?" asked Griselda, felt she could spend day looking clock, watching her little friend's appearance. "You see several times day," said her aunt, "for little room I intend prepare tasks. It nice quiet, nothing disturb you, close room Aunt Tabitha I usually sit." So saying, Miss Grizzel opened second door little ante-room, and, Griselda's surprise, foot short flight stairs another door, half open, she caught sight her Aunt Tabitha, knitting quietly fire, room breakfasted. "What _very_ funny house is, Aunt Grizzel," she said, she followed her aunt steps. "Every room many doors, come back think ever far off. I shall never able find way about." "Oh yes, will, dear, soon," said her aunt encouragingly. "She kind," thought Griselda; "but I wish she would not call lessons tasks. It makes sound dreadfully hard. But, way, I am glad I am room dear cuckoo lives." II _IM_PATIENT GRISELDA "... fairies seldom appear; If wrong must expect That cost us dear!" It well days. Griselda found plenty amuse herself novelty lasted, enough prevent her missing _very_ badly home she left "over sea," troop noisy merry brothers teased petted her. Of course she _missed_ them, "dreadfully." She neither homesick "dull." It quite smooth sailing lessons began. She dislike lessons; fact, she always thought she rather fond them. But alone lively, her teachers strict. The worst writing arithmetic master, funny little old man wore knee-breeches took snuff, called her aunt "Madame," bowing formally whenever he addressed her. He screwed Griselda unnatural attitude write her copies, she really felt she would never come straight loose again; arithmetic part his instructions even worse. Oh! sums addition he gave her! Griselda never partial sums, her rather easy-going governess home not, tell truth, partial either. And Mr.--I cannot remember little old gentleman's name. Suppose call Mr. Kneebreeches--Mr. Kneebreeches, he found out, conscientiously put her back beginning. It dreadful, really. He came twice week, days he did not come bad he did, he left her whole _row_, I going say, could not call Mr. Kneebreeches' addition sums "rows," far fat wide across spoken of!--whole slatefuls terrible mountains figures climb wearily top of. And climb _once_ merely. _The_ terrible thing Mr. Kneebreeches' favourite method he called "proving." I cannot explain it--it far beyond poor powers--but something cutting top line, added actually done sum, understand--cutting top line adding long rows without it, joining somewhere else. "I would not mind much," said poor Griselda, one day, "if good. But see, Aunt Grizzel, is not. For I am likely _proving_ wrong sum itself--more likely, I am always tired I get proving--and that is proved _something's_ wrong, I am sure is not good, except make cross." "Hush!" said her aunt gravely. "That way little girl speak. Improve golden hours youth, Griselda; never return." "I hope not," muttered Griselda, "if means sums." Miss Grizzel fortunately little deaf; she hear remark. Just cuckoo clock struck eleven. "Good little cuckoo," said Miss Grizzel. "What example he sets you. His life spent faithful discharge duty;" saying she left room. The cuckoo still telling hour--eleven took good while. It seemed Griselda bird repeated her aunt's last words. "Faith--ful, dis--charge, of--your, du--ty," he said, "faith--ful." "You horrid little creature!" exclaimed Griselda passion; "what business mock me?" She seized book, first came hand, flung bird beginning his eleventh cuckoo. He disappeared snap, disappeared without flapping his wings, or, Griselda always fancied he did, giving her friendly nod, instant silent. Griselda felt little frightened. What she done? She looked clock. It seemed usual, cuckoo's doors closely shut, sign disturbance. Could her fancy he sprung back hastily he would done her throwing book him? She began hope so, tried go her lessons. But use. Though she really gave her best attention long addition sums, found she managed much better before, she could feel happy ease. Every minutes she glanced clock, expecting cuckoo come out, though she knew quite well chance his till twelve of the clock, hours, half hours quarters, he told. "I wish twelve of the clock," she said herself anxiously once. If clock high wall, she would tempted climb open little doors, peep satisfy herself cuckoo's condition. But possibility this. The clock far, far her reach, high piece furniture standing near, upon she could climbed get it. There nothing done wait twelve of the clock. And, all, she wait twelve of the clock, half-past eleven, Miss Grizzel's voice heard calling her put her hat cloak quickly, come walk terrace her. "It fine now," said Miss Grizzel, "but prospect rain long. You must leave lessons present, finish afternoon." "I finished them," said Griselda, meekly. "_All?_" inquired her aunt. "Yes, all," replied Griselda. "Ah, well, then, afternoon, rain holds off, shall drive Merrybrow Hall, inquire health dear godmother, Lady Lavander," said Miss Grizzel. Poor Griselda! There things she disliked drive her aunts. They went old yellow chariot, windows up, course Griselda sit her back horses, made her uncomfortable she air, sit still long. Merrybrow Hall large house, quite old much grander, nearly wonderful home Griselda's aunts. It six miles off, took long time indeed drive rumbling old chariot, old horses fat wheezy, old coachman fat wheezy too. Lady Lavander was, course, old too--very old indeed, rather grumpy deaf. Miss Grizzel Miss Tabitha greatest respect her; she always called "My dear," quite girls, listened she said her words gold. For mysterious reason she invited Griselda's godmother; but, she never shown her proof affection beyond giving her prayer-book, hoping, whenever she saw her, she "a good little miss," Griselda feel particular gratitude her. The drive seemed longer duller ever afternoon, Griselda bore meekly; Lady Lavander, usual, expressed her hopes her, little girl looked modestly, feeling her cheeks grow scarlet. "I good little girl all," she felt inclined call out. "I am bad cruel. I believe I have killed dear little cuckoo." What _would_ three old ladies thought she called out? As was, Lady Lavander patted her approvingly, said she loved see young people modest humble-minded, gave her slice highly-spiced, rather musty gingerbread, Griselda could not bear. All way home Griselda felt fever impatience rush ante-room see cuckoo right again. It late dark chariot last stopped door old house. Miss Grizzel got slowly, still slowly Miss Tabitha followed her. Griselda obliged restrain herself move demurely. "It past supper-time, dear," said Miss Grizzel. "Go room, Dorcas shall bring supper you. Late hours bad young people." Griselda obediently wished her aunts good-night, went quietly upstairs. But sight, first landing, she changed her pace. She turned left instead right, led her room, flew rather ran along dimly-lighted passage, end door led great saloon. She opened door. All quite dark. It impossible fly run across great saloon! Even daylight would difficult matter. Griselda _felt_ her way best she could, past Chinese cabinet pot-pourri jar till she got ante-room door. It open, now, knowing her way better, she hurried in. But use? All silent, save tick-tick cuckoo clock corner. Oh, _only_ cuckoo would come call hour usual, weight would lifted Griselda's heart! She idea of the clock was. It might close hour, might past it. She stood listening minutes, hearing Miss Grizzel's voice distance, she felt she dared stay longer, turned feel her way room again. Just she got door seemed her something softly brushed her cheek, very, faint "cuckoo" sounded, were, air close her. Startled, frightened, Griselda stood perfectly still. "Cuckoo," she said, softly. But answer. Again tones Miss Grizzel's voice coming upstairs reached her ear. "I _must_ go," said Griselda; finding her way across saloon without, great good luck, tumbling many breakable treasures filled, she flew long passage again, reaching her room Dorcas appeared her supper. Griselda slept badly night. She constantly dreaming cuckoo, fancying she heard his voice, waking start find _only_ fancy. She looked pale heavy-eyed she came breakfast next morning; her Aunt Tabitha, alone room she entered, began immediately asking her matter. "I sure going ill, child," she said, nervously. "Sister Grizzel must give medicine. I wonder would best. Tansy tea excellent thing one taken cold, or----" But rest Miss Tabitha's sentence never heard, moment Miss Grizzel came hurriedly room--her cap awry, her shawl disarranged, her face pale. I hardly think one ever seen her discomposed before. "Sister Tabitha!" she exclaimed, "what going happen? The cuckoo clock stopped." "The cuckoo clock stopped!" repeated Miss Tabitha, holding her hands; "_im_possible!" "But has, rather I say--dear me, I upset I cannot explain myself--the _cuckoo_ stopped. The clock going on, cuckoo told hours, Dorcas opinion he left yesterday. What going happen? What shall do?" "What do?" said Miss Tabitha. "Should send watch-maker?" Miss Grizzel shook her head. "'Twould worse useless. Were search world over, could find one put right. Fifty years more, Tabitha, fifty years more, never missed hour! We getting old, Tabitha, day nearly over; perhaps it is remind us this." Miss Tabitha reply. She weeping silently. The old ladies seemed forgotten presence niece, Griselda could bear see distress. She finished her breakfast quickly she could, left room. On her way upstairs she met Dorcas. "Have heard happened, little missie?" said old servant. "Yes," replied Griselda. "My ladies great trouble," continued Dorcas, seemed inclined communicative usual, "and wonder. For fifty years clock never gone wrong." "Cannot put right?" asked child. Dorcas shook her head. "No good would come interfering," she said. "What must be, must be. The luck house hangs clock. Its maker spent good part his life it, his last words would bring good luck house owned it, trouble would follow silence. It is belief," she added solemnly, "that it is _fairy_ clock, neither less, good luck brought there is denying. There cows like ours, missie--their milk proverb hereabouts; hens like laying year round; roses like ours. And there is always friendly feeling house, always been. It Is house wrangling jangling, sharp words. The 'good people' cannot stand that. Nothing drives away like ill-temper anger." Griselda's conscience gave her sharp prick. Could _her_ trouble coming upon old house? What punishment moment's fit ill-temper. "I wish would not talk way, Dorcas," she said; "it makes unhappy." "What feeling heart child has!" said old servant she went her way downstairs. "It is true--she like Miss Sybilla." That day weary sad one Griselda. She oppressed feeling she understand. She knew she done wrong, she sorely repented it, "I think cuckoo might come back again," she said herself, "if he _is_ fairy; he is not, cannot true Dorcas says." Her aunts made allusion subject her presence, almost seemed forgotten she known distress. They grave silent usual, otherwise things went ordinary way. Griselda spent morning "at her tasks," ante-room, thankful get away tick-tick clock corner garden. But there, alas! bad. The rooks seemed know something matter; set work making chatter immediately Griselda appeared she felt inclined run back house again. "I sure talking me," she said herself. "Perhaps fairies too. I beginning think I do not like fairies." She glad bed-time came. It sort reproach her see her aunts pale troubled; though she tried persuade herself she thought silly, she could throw uncomfortable feeling. She tired she went bed--tired disagreeable way comes listless, uneasy day--that she fell asleep slept heavily. When she woke, she suddenly, start, still perfectly dark, like first morning she wakened old house. It seemed her she wakened herself--something roused her. Yes! again, very, _very_ soft distant "cuckoo." _Was_ distant? She could tell. Almost she could fancied close her. "If it is cuckoo come back again, I will catch him!" exclaimed Griselda. She darted bed, felt her way door, closed, opening let rush moonlight unshuttered passage window. In another moment her little bare feet pattering along passage full speed, direction great saloon. For Griselda's childhood among troop noisy brothers taught her one lesson--she afraid nothing. Or rather perhaps I say she never learnt anything afraid of! And there? III OBEYING ORDERS "Little girl, thou must thy part fulfil, If we are take kindly ours: Then pull weeds will, And fairies cherish flowers." There moonlight, though much, saloon ante-room, too; though windows, like Griselda's bed-room, shutters closed, round part top, high up, shutters reach to, crept, clear uncovered panes, quite many moonbeams, may sure, could find way. Griselda, eager though she was, could help standing still moment admire effect. "It looks prettier light coming holes top even shutters open," she said herself. "How goldy-silvery cabinet looks; and, yes, I declare, mandarins nodding! I wonder politeness me, Aunt Grizzel come last thing night touch make keep nodding till morning? I _suppose_ they are sort policemen palace; I dare say sorts beautiful things inside. How I like see it!" But moment faint tick-tick cuckoo clock next room, reaching her ear, reminded her object midnight expedition hers. She hurried ante-room. It looked darker great saloon, one window. But uncovered space top window penetrated brilliant moonbeams, one lighted brightly face clock queer over-hanging eaves. Griselda approached stood below, looking up. "Cuckoo," she said softly--very softly. But reply. "Cuckoo," she repeated rather loudly. "Why will not speak me? I know there, you are asleep, I heard voice room. Why will not come out, cuckoo?" "Tick-tick," said clock, reply. Griselda felt ready cry. "Cuckoo," she said reproachfully, "I did not think hard-hearted. I _so_ unhappy you, I pleased hear voice again, I thought I killed you, hurt badly; I did not _mean_ hurt you, cuckoo. I sorry moment I done it, _dreadfully_ sorry. Dear cuckoo, will not forgive me?" There little sound last--a faint _coming_ sound, moonlight Griselda saw doors open, flew cuckoo. He stood still moment, looked round were, gently flapped his wings, uttered his usual note--"Cuckoo." Griselda stood breathless expectation, her delight she could help softly clapping her hands. The cuckoo cleared his throat. You never heard funny little noise he made; then, clear, distinct, yet "cuckoo-y" voice, he spoke. "Griselda," he said, "are truly sorry?" "I told I was," she replied. "But I did not _feel_ naughty, cuckoo. I did not, really. I vexed one minute, I threw book I seemed little fun, too. And made unhappy went away, poor aunts dreadfully unhappy too. If had not come back I told tomorrow I done. I would told before, I afraid would made unhappy. I thought I hurt dreadfully." "So did," said cuckoo. "But _look_ quite well," said Griselda. "It _feelings_," replied cuckoo; "and I could not help going away. I obey orders like people." Griselda stared. "How mean?" she asked. "Never mind. You cannot understand present," said cuckoo. "You understand obeying _your_ orders, see, do not, things go wrong." "Yes," said Griselda humbly, "they certainly do. But, cuckoo," she continued, "I never used get tempers home--_hardly_ never, least; I liked lessons then, I never scolded them." "What is wrong here, then?" said cuckoo. "It is not often things go wrong house." "That is Dorcas says," said Griselda. "It must child--my aunts house everything got children's ways." "About time did," remarked cuckoo drily. "And so," continued Griselda, "it really dull. I lots lessons, is not much I mind. It I have one play with." "There is something that," said cuckoo. He flapped his wings silent minute two. "I will consider it," he observed last. "Thank you," said Griselda, exactly knowing else say. "And meantime," continued cuckoo, "you would better obey present orders go back bed." "Shall I say good-night you, then?" asked Griselda somewhat timidly. "You are quite welcome so," replied cuckoo. "Why should not you?" "You see I was not sure would like it," returned Griselda, "for course you are like person, and--and--I have told sorts queer things fairies like do not like." "Who said I fairy?" inquired cuckoo. "Dorcas did, and, _of course_, common sense too," replied Griselda. "You must fairy--you could not anything else." "I might fairyfied cuckoo," suggested bird. Griselda looked puzzled. "I do not understand," she said, "and I do not think could make much difference. But whatever are, I wish would tell one thing." "What?" said cuckoo. "I want know, you have forgiven throwing book you, come back good?" "Certainly evil," replied cuckoo. Griselda gave little wriggle. "Cuckoo, you are laughing me," she said. "I mean, come back stay cuckoo usual make aunts happy again?" "You will see morning," said cuckoo. "Now go bed." "Good night," said Griselda, "and thank you, please do not forget let know you have considered." "Cuckoo, cuckoo," her little friend's reply. Griselda thought meant good night, fact matter exact second time two of the clock morning. She made her way back bed. She standing time talking cuckoo, but, though well November, she feel least cold, sleepy! She felt happy light-hearted possible, she wished morning, she might get up. Yet moment she laid her little brown curly head pillow, she fell asleep; seemed her she dropped soft feathery wing brushed her cheek gently tiny "Cuckoo" sounded her ear. When she woke bright morning, really bright morning, wintry sun already sending clear yellow rays pale grey-blue sky. "It must late," thought Griselda, she opened shutters seen light was. "I must slept long time. I feel beautifully unsleepy now. I must dress quickly--how nice see aunts look happy again! I do not even care scold late." But, all, much later usual; much brighter morning time. Griselda dress herself quickly, however. As she went downstairs two three clocks house, several, striking eight. These clocks must little right time, till relapsed silence rang ante-room clear sweet tones, eight times repeated, "Cuckoo." Miss Grizzel Miss Tabitha already breakfast-table, received little niece graciously. Nothing said clock, however, till half-way meal, Griselda, full eagerness know her aunts aware cuckoo's return, could restrain herself longer. "Aunt Grizzel," she said, "is not cuckoo right again?" "Yes, dear. I delighted say is," replied Miss Grizzel. "Did get put right, Aunt Grizzel?" inquired Griselda, slyly. "Little girls ask many questions," replied Miss Grizzel, mysteriously. "It _is_ right again, enough. During fifty years cuckoo never, till yesterday, missed hour. If you, sphere, dear, well fifty years, will not done badly." "No, indeed, will not done badly," repeated Miss Tabitha. But though two old ladies thus tried improve occasion little lecturing, Griselda could see bottom hearts happy that, even she naughty indeed, could hardly made minds scold her. She inclined naughty day. She something think look forward to, made her quite different little girl, made her take heart her lessons well she possibly could. "I wonder cuckoo considered enough one play with?" she said herself, she walking terrace back house. "Caw, caw!" screamed rook her head, answer her thought. Griselda looked him. "Your voice is not half pretty cuckoo's, Mr. Rook," she said. "All same, I dare say I make friends you, I understood meant. How funny would know languages birds beasts, like prince fairy tale! I wonder I wish that, fairy gave wish? No, I do not think I would. I would _far_ rather fairy carpet would take anywhere liked minute. I would go China see people look like Aunt Grizzel's mandarins; I would first all, course, go fairyland." "You must come now, little missie," said Dorcas's voice. "Miss Grizzel says play enough, there is nice fire ante-room lessons by." "Play!" repeated Griselda indignantly, she turned follow old servant. "Do call walking terrace 'play,' Dorcas? I must not loiter even pick flower, any, fear catching cold, I must not run fear overheating myself. I declare, Dorcas, I do not play soon, something amuse me, I think I will run away." "Nay, nay, missie, do not talk like that. You would never anything naughty, like Miss Sybilla, good." "Dorcas, I am tired told I am like Miss Sybilla," said Griselda, impatiently. "She grandmother; one would like told like grandmother. It makes feel face must screwy wrinkly, I spectacles wig." "_That_ like Miss Sybilla I first saw her," said Dorcas. "She younger you, missie, pretty fairy." "_Was_ she?" exclaimed Griselda, stopping short. "Yes, indeed she was. She might fairy, sweet she gentle--and yet merry. Every creature loved her; even animals seemed know her, she one themselves. She brought good luck house, sad day she left it." "I thought said cuckoo brought good luck?" said Griselda. "Well, was. The cuckoo Miss Sybilla came day. It left her her mother's father, she lived since she baby, he died she came her sisters. She was not _own_ sister ladies, see, missie. Her mother come Germany, strange place there, her grandfather lived, cuckoo clock made. They make wonderful clocks there, I have told, none wonderful cuckoo, I am sure." "No, I am _sure_ not," said Griselda, softly. "Why did not Miss Sybilla take her she married went away?" "She knew her sisters fond it. It like memory her left behind them. It like part her. And know, missie, night she died--she died soon father born, year she married--for whole hour, twelve one, cuckoo went cuckooing soft, sad way, like living creature trouble. Of course, know anything wrong her, folks said something caught springs works; _I_ did not think so, never shall. And----" But Dorcas's reminiscences abruptly brought close Miss Grizzel's appearance end terrace. "Griselda, loitering for? Dorcas, hastened, delayed Miss Griselda." So Griselda hurried her lessons, Dorcas her kitchen. But Griselda much mind. She plenty think wonder about, she liked her lessons ante-room, tick-tick clock her ears, feeling _perhaps_ cuckoo watching her invisible peep-hole his closed doors. "And he sees," thought Griselda, "if he sees hard I trying lessons well, perhaps make quick 'considering.'" So she try hard. And she did not speak cuckoo he came say four of the clock. She busy, he busy. She felt better wait till he gave her sign ready talk her again. For fairies, know, children, however charming, sometimes _rather_ queer with. They do not like interfered with, treated except great respect, ideas proper is not, I assure you. I suppose working hard her lessons--most people say night before, running house moonlight; she never felt "fresh" her life she got morning, could hardly that--that Griselda felt tired sleepy evening, she could hardly keep her eyes open. She begged go bed quite half hour earlier usual, made Miss Tabitha afraid she going ill. But nothing better children go bed early, even _are_ going ill, Miss Grizzel told her say good-night, ask Dorcas give her wine-glassful elderberry wine, nice hot, she bed. Griselda objection elderberry wine, though she felt she false pretences. She certainly need send her sleep, almost her head touched pillow she sound top. She slept good long while, she wakened suddenly--just she done night before, feeling something wakened her. And queer thing moment she awake she felt _very_ awake--she inclination stretch yawn hope was not quite time get up, think nice warm bed was, cold outside! She sat straight up, peered darkness, feeling quite ready adventure. "Is you, cuckoo?" she said softly. There answer, listening intently, child fancied she heard faint rustling fluttering corner room door. She got and, feeling her way, opened it, instant she done she heard, steps front her seemed, familiar notes, very, _very_ soft whispered, "Cuckoo, cuckoo." It went on, passage, Griselda trotting after. There moon to-night, heavy clouds quite hidden it, outside rain falling heavily. Griselda could hear window-panes, closed shutters all. But dark was, she made her way along without difficulty, passage, across great saloon, ante-room door, guided little voice heard front her. She came standstill right clock, stood minute two patiently waiting. She long wait. There came usual murmuring sound, doors clock face opened--she heard open, far dark see--and his ordinary voice, clear distinct (it two of the clock, cuckoo killing two birds one stone, telling hour greeting Griselda once), bird sang out, "Cuckoo, cuckoo." "Good evening, cuckoo," said Griselda, he finished. "Good morning, mean," said cuckoo. "Good morning, then, cuckoo," said Griselda. "Have considered me, cuckoo?" The cuckoo cleared his throat. "Have learnt obey orders yet, Griselda?" he inquired. "I am trying," replied Griselda. "But see, cuckoo, I have long learn in--it last night told me, know." The cuckoo sighed. "You have great deal learn, Griselda." "I dare say I have," she said. "But I tell one thing, cuckoo--whatever lessons I have, I _couldn't_ ever worse addition sums Mr. Kneebreeches'. I made mind that, to-day, know, cuckoo----" "Yesterday," corrected cuckoo. "Always exact statements, Griselda." "Well, yesterday, then," said Griselda, rather tartly; "though know quite well I mean, I do not see need _very_ particular. Well, I saying, I tried _tried_, still fearful. They were, indeed." "You have great deal learn, Griselda," repeated cuckoo. "I wish would not say often," said Griselda. "I thought going _play_ me." "There is something that," said cuckoo, "there is something that. I like talk it. But could talk comfortably would come sit beside me." Griselda thought her friend must going his mind. "Sit beside there!" she exclaimed. "Cuckoo, _could_ I? I am far, far big." "Big!" returned cuckoo. "What mean big? It is matter fancy. Do not know world everything it, counting course, made little enough go walnut, you would never find difference." "_Wouldn't_ I?" said Griselda, feeling rather muddled; "but, _not_ counting myself, cuckoo, I would then, would not I?" "Nonsense," said cuckoo hastily; "you have great deal learn, one thing is, _argue_. Nobody argue; it is shocking bad habit, ruins digestion. Come sit beside comfortably. Catch hold chain; you will find manage try." "But it will stop clock," said Griselda. "Aunt Grizzel said I never touch weights chains." "Stuff," said cuckoo; "it will not stop clock. Catch hold chains swing up. There now--I told could manage it." IV THE COUNTRY OF THE NODDING MANDARINS "We are nodding, nid-nid-nodding." How she managed she never knew; but, somehow other, _was_ managed. She seemed slide chain easily general way she would slidden down, without disagreeable anticipation bump end journey. And she got top wonderfully different looked anything she could expected! The doors stood open, Griselda found quite big enough, herself quite small enough--which she could not tell, matter fancy she decided trouble inquire--to pass quite comfortably. And inside charming little snuggery imaginable. It something like saloon railway carriage--it seemed lined carpeted everything, rich mossy red velvet; little round table middle two arm-chairs, one sat cuckoo--"quite like people," thought Griselda herself--while other, he pointed Griselda little nod, evidently intended her. "Thank you," said she, sitting chair she spoke. "Are comfortable?" inquired cuckoo. "Quite," replied Griselda, looking her great satisfaction. "Are cuckoo clocks like get inside them?" she inquired. "I cannot think there is room dear little place clock wall. Is hole cut wall purpose, cuckoo?" "Hush!" said cuckoo, "we have got things talk about. First, shall I lend one mantles? You may feel cold." "I do not now," replied Griselda; "but perhaps I _might_." She looked her little bare feet she spoke, wondered _they_ were not cold, chilblainy weather. The cuckoo stood up, one his claws reached corner hanging cloak Griselda noticed. For hanging wrong side out, lining red velvet, like sides little room covered with, wonder she noticed it. Had hanging _right_ side she must done so; side wonderful! It feathers--feathers every shade colour, beautifully worked in, somehow, lie quite smoothly evenly, one colour melting away another like prism, could hardly tell one began another ended. "What _lovely_ cloak!" said Griselda, wrapping round her feeling even comfortable before, she watched rays little lamp roof--I think I forgetting tell cuckoo's boudoir lighted dear little lamp set red velvet roof like pearl ring--playing softly brilliant colours feather mantle. "It is better lovely," said cuckoo, "as shall see. Now, Griselda," he continued, tone one coming business--"now, Griselda, let us talk." "We talking," said Griselda, "ever long. I comfortable. When say 'let us talk' like that, makes forget I wanted say. Just let sit still say whatever comes head." "That will not do," said cuckoo; "we must plan action." "A what?" said Griselda. "You see _have_ great deal learn," said cuckoo triumphantly. "You do not understand I say." "But I did not come learn," said Griselda; "I there;" she nodded her head direction ante-room table. "I want play." "Just so," said cuckoo; "that is I want talk about. What call 'play'--blindman's-buff sort thing?" "No," said Griselda, considering. "I am getting rather big kind play. Besides, cuckoo, I alone could not much fun blindman's-buff; there would catch catch me." "Oh, could easily get more," said cuckoo. "The mandarins would pleased join." "The mandarins!" repeated Griselda. "Why, cuckoo, they are alive! How could play?" The cuckoo looked her gravely minute, shook his head. "You _great_ deal learn," he said solemnly. "Do not know _everything's_ alive?" "No," said Griselda, "I do not; I do not know mean, I do not think I want know mean. I want talk playing." "Well," said cuckoo, "talk." "What I call playing," pursued Griselda, "is--I thought now, see--is amused. If amuse me, cuckoo, I count playing me." "How shall I amuse you?" inquired he. "Oh, that is find out!" exclaimed Griselda. "You might tell fairy stories, know: you are fairy know lots; or--oh yes, course would far nicer--if fairy might take fairyland." Again cuckoo shook his head. "That," said he, "I cannot do." "Why not?" said Griselda. "Lots children there." "I doubt it," said cuckoo. "_Some_ may been, lots. And may thought had not really all. And there, may sure one thing--they _taken_, found way. No one ever _taken_ fairyland--to real fairyland. They may taken neighbouring countries, fairyland itself." "And one ever find one's way there?" asked Griselda. "That I cannot tell either," replied cuckoo. "There many roads there; may find day. And ever find it, sure keep see well swept clean, may see while. Ah, yes, many roads many doors fairyland!" "Doors!" cried Griselda. "Are doors fairyland house?" "Several," said cuckoo; "but do not waste time looking present. It would use." "Then amuse me?" inquired Griselda, rather disappointed tone. "Do not care go anywhere except fairyland?" said cuckoo. "Oh yes, lots places I would not mind seeing. Not geography sort places--it would like lessons go India Africa places--but _queer_ places, like mines goblins make diamonds precious stones, caves sea mermaids live. And--oh, I have thought--now I am nice little, I _would_ like go mandarins' palace great saloon." "That easily managed," said cuckoo; "but--excuse instant," he exclaimed suddenly. He gave spring forward disappeared. Then Griselda heard his voice outside doors, "Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo." It three of the clock. The doors opened let through, he re-settled his chair. "As I saying," he went on, "nothing could easier. But palace, call it, entrance side, well one know." "Another door, mean?" said Griselda. "How funny! Does go wall? And lead to?" "It leads," replied cuckoo, "it leads country Nodding Mandarins." "_What_ fun!" exclaimed Griselda, clapping her hands. "Cuckoo, let us go there. How get down? You fly, must I slide chain again?" "Oh dear, no," said cuckoo, "by means. You stretch feather mantle, flap wings--so"--he flapped his wings encouragingly--"wish, you will be." "Where?" said Griselda bewilderedly. "Wherever wish be, course," said cuckoo. "Are ready? Here goes." "Wait--wait moment," cried Griselda. "Where I wish be?" "Bless child!" exclaimed cuckoo. "Where _do_ wish be? You said wanted visit country Nodding Mandarins." "Yes; I wish first palace great saloon?" "Certainly," replied cuckoo. "That entrance Mandarin Land, said would like see it. So--you are surely ready now?" "A thought struck me," said Griselda. "How know of the clock is, come back time tell next hour? My aunts get fright go wrong again! Are sure shall time go mandarins' country to-night?" "Time!" repeated cuckoo; "what time? Ah, Griselda, _very_ great deal learn! What mean time?" "I do not know," replied Griselda, feeling rather snubbed. "Being slow quick--I suppose that is I mean." "And slow, quick?" said cuckoo. "_All_ matter fancy! If everything that is done since world made till now, done five minutes, you would never know difference." "Oh, cuckoo, I wish would not!" cried poor Griselda; "you are worse sums, puzzle me. It is like said nothing big little, it is worse. Where would days hours nothing minutes? Oh, cuckoo, said you would amuse me, nothing puzzle me." "It fault. You would not get ready," said cuckoo, "_Now_, goes! Flap wish." Griselda flapped wished. She felt sort rustle air, all--then she found herself standing cuckoo front Chinese cabinet, door stood open, mandarins side, nodding politely, seemed invite enter. Griselda hesitated. "Go on," said cuckoo, patronizingly; "ladies first." Griselda went on. To her surprise, inside cabinet quite light, though light came illuminated queer corners recesses streamed front, stood mandarins, she could discover. The "palace" quite interesting she expected. There lots little rooms opening balconies commanding, doubt, splendid view great saloon; ever many little stair-cases leading little rooms balconies; seemed empty deserted. "I do not care it," said Griselda, stopping short last; "it is same, there is nothing see. I thought aunts kept ever many beautiful things here, there is nothing." "Come along, then," said cuckoo. "I did not expect you would care palace, called it, much. Let us go way." He hopped sort little staircase near standing, Griselda followed willingly enough. At foot found vestibule, much handsomer entrance side, cuckoo, crossing it, lifted one his claws touched spring wall. Instantly pair large doors flew open middle, revealing Griselda prettiest curious sight she ever seen. [Illustration: HE FLAPPED HIS WINGS, AND A PALANQUIN APPEARED AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS] A flight wide, shallow steps led doorway long, long avenue bordered stiffly growing trees, branches hung innumerable lamps every colour, making perfect network brilliance far eye could reach. "Oh, lovely!" cried Griselda, clapping her hands. "It will like walking along rainbow. Cuckoo, come quick." "Stop," said cuckoo; "we have good way go. There is need walk. Palanquin!" He flapped his wings, instantly palanquin appeared foot steps. It made carved ivory, borne four Chinese-looking figures pigtails bright-coloured jackets. A feeling came Griselda she dreaming, else she seen palanquin before. She hesitated. Suddenly she gave little jump satisfaction. "I know," she exclaimed. "It is exactly like one stands glass shade Lady Lavander's drawing-room mantelpiece. I wonder one? Fancy able get _into_ it!" She looked four bearers. Instantly nodded. "What mean?" asked Griselda, turning cuckoo. "Get in," he replied. "Yes, I am going get in," she said; "but _they_ mean nod like that?" "They mean, course, I tell you--'Get in,'" said cuckoo. "Why do not say so, then?" persisted Griselda, getting in, however, she spoke. "Griselda, _very_ great----" began cuckoo, Griselda interrupted him. "Cuckoo," she exclaimed, "if say again, I will jump palanquin run away home bed. Of course I have great deal learn--that is I like ask questions everything I see. Now, tell going." "In first place," said cuckoo, "are comfortable?" "Very," said Griselda, settling herself among cushions. It change cuckoo's boudoir. There chairs seats, number very, _very_ soft cushions covered green silk. There green silk curtains round, too, could draw pleased, touching spring. Griselda stroked silk gently. It "fruzzley" silk, know means; make feel nails wanted cutting, rough places skin rubbed wrong way; softness like rose pansy petal. "What nice silk!" said Griselda. "I would like dress it. I never noticed palanquin lined nicely," she continued, "for I suppose _is_ one Lady Lavander's mantelpiece? There could not two exactly like other." The cuckoo gave sort whistle. "What goose are, dear!" he exclaimed. "Excuse me," he continued, seeing Griselda looked rather offended; "I did not mean hurt feelings, will not let say thing, know. The palanquin Lady Lavander's! I think not. You might well mistake one horrible paper roses Dorcas sticks her vases one aunt's Gloires de Dijon! The palanquin Lady Lavander's--a clumsy human imitation worth looking at!" "I did not know," said Griselda humbly. "Do make beautiful things Mandarin Land?" "Of course," said cuckoo. Griselda sat silent minute two, soon she recovered her spirits. "Will please tell going?" she asked again. "You will see directly," said cuckoo; "not I mind telling you. There is grand reception one palaces to-night. I thought you would like assist it. It will give idea palace like. By-the-by, dance?" "A little," replied Griselda. "Ah, well, I dare say manage. I have ordered court dress you. It ready get there." "Thank you," said Griselda. In minute two palanquin stopped. The cuckoo got out, Griselda followed him. She found entrance _very_ much grander palace one her aunt's saloon. The steps leading door wide shallow, covered gold embroidered carpet, _looked_ would prickly her bare feet, which, contrary, she trod upon it, felt softer softest moss. She could see little besides carpet, side steps stood rows rows mandarins, something like, great deal grander than, pair outside her aunt's cabinet; cuckoo hopped Griselda walked staircase, all, turn, row row, began solemnly nod. It gave look field high grass, which, one passing, leaves moment trail, till heads bob places. "What mean?" whispered Griselda. "It is royal salute," said cuckoo. "A salute!" said Griselda. "I thought meant kissing guns." "Hush!" said cuckoo, time arrived top staircase; "you must dressed now." Two mandariny-looking young ladies, porcelain faces three-cornered head-dresses, stepped forward led Griselda small ante-room, lay waiting her magnificent dress ever saw. But _do_ think dressed her? It nodding. They nodded blue silver embroidered jacket, moment fitted her. They nodded splendid scarlet satin skirt, made short front long behind, Griselda knew she was, adjusted quite correctly. They nodded head-dress, sashes, necklaces bracelets, forthwith arranged themselves. Last all, nodded dearest, sweetest little pair high-heeled shoes imaginable--all silver, blue, gold, scarlet, everything mixed together, _only_ rather stumpy shape toes Griselda's bare feet encased them, and, her surprise, quite comfortably so. "They do not hurt bit," she said aloud; "yet did not look least shape foot." But her attendants nodded; turning round, she saw cuckoo waiting her. He speak either, rather her annoyance, gravely led way one grand room another grandest all, entertainment evidently begin. And everywhere mandarins, rows rows, set work nodding fast Griselda appeared. She began rather tired royal salutes, glad when, last, profound silence, procession, consisting cuckoo herself, half dozen "mandarins," came halt kind daïs, raised seat, end hall. Upon daïs stood chair--a throne kind, Griselda supposed be--and upon seated grandest gravest personage she yet seen. "Is he king mandarins?" she whispered. But cuckoo reply; she time repeat question, grand grave person got his seat, coming towards her offered her his hand, time nodding--first once, two three times together, again. Griselda seemed know he meant. He asking her dance. "Thank you," she said. "I cannot dance _very_ well, perhaps will not mind." The king, his title, took slightest notice her reply, nodded again--once, two three times together, alone, before. Griselda know do, suddenly she felt something poking her head. It cuckoo--he lifted his claw, tapping her head make her nod. So she nodded--once, twice together, once--that appeared enough. The king nodded again; invisible band suddenly struck loveliest music, set places honour reserved centre room, mandarins assembling. What dance was! It began like minuet ended something like haymakers. Griselda least idea figures steps were, matter. If she know, her shoes something her did; she got famously. The music lovely--"so mandarins cannot deaf, though dumb," thought Griselda, "which one good thing them." The king seemed enjoy much she did, though he never smiled laughed; one could seen he liked way he whirled twirled about. And figures, stopped rest little, Griselda got well too. There conversation, rather, was, nodding. So Griselda nodded too, though she know her nods meant, king seemed understand quite pleased; nodded enough, music struck again, set, harder before. And every tiny little mandariny boys appeared trays filled delicious fruits sweetmeats. Griselda greedy child, her life she really _did_ feel rather so. I cannot possibly describe delicious things; think whatever life "lovely" thing ever eat, may sure tasted like that. Only cuckoo would eat any, rather distressed Griselda. He walked among dancers, apparently quite home; mandarins seem surprised see him, though he look rather odd, nearly, quite, big them. Griselda hoped he enjoying himself, considering she thank fun _she_ having, she felt little conscience-stricken she saw he would not eat anything. "Cuckoo," she whispered; she dared talk loud--it would seemed remarkable, see. "Cuckoo," she said, very, softly, "I wish would eat something. You will tired hungry." "No, thank you," said cuckoo; cannot think pleased Griselda succeeded making speak. "It is not way. I hope enjoying yourself?" "Oh, _very_ much," said Griselda. "I----" "Hush!" said cuckoo; looking up, Griselda saw number mandarins, sort procession, coming way. When got cuckoo set work nodding, two three time, energetically usual. When stopped, cuckoo nodded return, hopped towards middle room. "They are fond good music, see," he whispered he passed Griselda; "and do not often get it." V PICTURES "And she always beautiful And always eighteen!" When he got middle room cuckoo cleared his throat, flapped his wings, began sing. Griselda quite astonished. She idea her friend accomplished. It was not "cuckooing" all; real singing, like nightingale thrush, like something prettier either. It made Griselda think woods summer, tinkling brooks flowing them, pretty brown pebbles sparkling water; made her think something sad--she did not know what; perhaps babes wood robins covering leaves--and again, moment, sounded merry elves sprites ever heard escaped fairyland, rolling peals rollicking laughter. And last, sudden, song came end. "Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!" rang three times, clear shrill. The cuckoo flapped his wings, made bow mandarins, retired his old corner. There buzz talk, usual performance come close, great buzz nodding, Griselda, wishing give cuckoo much praise she could, nodded hard them. The cuckoo really looked quite shy receiving much applause. But minute two music struck dancing began again--one, two, three: seemed sort mazurka time, suited mandarins well, gave chance nodding mark time. Griselda learnt mazurka, she got even better before--only she would liked her shoes sharper toes; looked stumpy she tried point them. All same, good fun, she well pleased she suddenly felt little sharp tap cuckoo her head, heard whisper-- "Griselda, it is time go." "Oh dear, why?" she asked. "I am bit tired. Why need go yet?" "Obeying orders," said cuckoo; that, Griselda dared say another word. It nearly bad told she great deal learn. "Must I say good-bye king people?" she inquired; cuckoo time answer, she gave little squeal. "Oh, cuckoo," she cried, "you have trod foot." "I beg pardon," said cuckoo. "I must take shoe; hurt," she went on. "Take off, then," said cuckoo. Griselda stooped take her shoe. "Are going home pal----?" she began say; she never finished sentence, she got her shoe she felt cuckoo throw something round her. It feather mantle. And Griselda knew nothing till she opened her eyes next morning, saw first early rays sunshine peeping chinks closed shutters her little bed-room. She rubbed her eyes, sat bed. Could dream? "What could made fall asleep sudden?" she thought. "I was not least sleepy mandarins' ball. What fun was! I believe cuckoo made fall asleep purpose make fancy dream. _Was_ dream?" She began feel confused doubtful, suddenly she felt something hurting her arm, like little lump bed. She felt her hand see she could smooth away, drew out--one shoes belonging her court dress! The one she held her hand moment cuckoo spirited her home bed. "Ah, Mr. Cuckoo!" she exclaimed, "you meant play trick, have not succeeded, see." She jumped bed unfastened one window-shutters, jumped admire little shoe comfort. It even prettier she thought ball. She held looked it. It size first joint her little finger. "To think I dancing last night!" she said shoe. "And yet cuckoo says big little matter fancy. I wonder he will think amuse next?" She still holding shoe admiring Dorcas came hot water. "Look, Dorcas," she said. "Bless me, it is one shoes Chinese dolls saloon," exclaimed old servant. "How ever get that, missie? Your aunts would not pleased." "It is not one Chinese dolls' shoes, do not believe me, go look yourself," said Griselda. "It is shoe, given self." Dorcas looked her curiously, said more, she going room Griselda heard her saying something "so like Miss Sybilla." "I wonder 'Miss Sybilla' _was_ like?" thought Griselda. "I good mind ask cuckoo. He seems known her well." It days Griselda chance asking cuckoo anything. She saw heard nothing him--nothing, say, his regular appearance tell hours usual. "I suppose," thought Griselda, "he thinks mandarins' ball fun enough last good while. It really good-natured take it, I must not grumble." A days poor Griselda caught cold. It bad cold, I must confess, her aunts made rather fuss it. They wanted her stay bed, Griselda much objected insist upon it. "It would dull," she said piteously. "Please let stay ante-room, things there; and, then, there is cuckoo." Aunt Grizzel smiled this, Griselda got her way. But even ante-room rather dull. Miss Grizzel Miss Tabitha obliged go out, drive way Merrybrow Hall, Lady Lavander sent messenger say she attack influenza, wished see her friends once. Miss Tabitha began cry--she tender-hearted. "Troubles never come singly," said Miss Grizzel, way consolation. "No, indeed, never come singly," said Miss Tabitha, shaking her head wiping her eyes. So set; Griselda, her arm-chair ante-room fire, queer little old-fashioned books her aunts', she already read dozen times, beside her way amusement, felt one comfort her troubles--she escaped long weary drive her godmother's. But dull. It got duller duller. Griselda curled herself her chair, wished she could go sleep, though feeling quite sure she could not, she stayed bed much later usual morning, obliged spend time sleeping, want anything better do. She looked clock. "I do not know even wish for," she said herself. "I do not feel least inclined play anything, I should not care go mandarins again. Oh, cuckoo, cuckoo, I dull; could not think anything amuse me?" It near "any of the clock." But waiting minute two, seemed Griselda she heard soft sound "coming" always preceded cuckoo's appearance. She right. In another moment she heard his usual greeting, "Cuckoo, cuckoo!" "Oh, cuckoo!" she exclaimed, "I glad come last. I _am_ dull, nothing lessons time. It is I have got bad cold, head's aching, I am tired reading, myself." "What would like do?" said cuckoo. "You do not want go see mandarins again?" "Oh no; I could not dance." "Or mermaids sea?" "Oh, dear, no," said Griselda, little shiver, "it would far cold. I would like stay I am, one would tell stories. I am even sure I could listen stories. What could amuse me, cuckoo?" "Would like see pictures?" said cuckoo. "I could show pictures without taking trouble." "Oh yes, would beautiful," cried Griselda. "What pictures show me? Oh, I know. I would like see place born--where very, clever man made clock, I mean." "Your great-great-grandfather," said cuckoo. "Very well. Now, Griselda, shut eyes. First all, I going sing." Griselda shut her eyes, cuckoo began his song. It something like he sung mandarins' palace, even beautiful. It soft dreamy, Griselda felt she could sat ever, listening it. The first notes low murmuring. Again made Griselda think little rippling brooks summer, came sort hum insects buzzing warm sunshine near. This humming gradually increased, till last Griselda conscious nothing more--_everything_ seemed humming, herself too, till last she fell asleep. When she opened her eyes, ante-room everything it, except arm-chair she still curled up, disappeared--melted away misty cloud round her, turn gradually faded, till her she saw scene quite new strange. It first cuckoo's "pictures." An old, quaint room, high, carved mantelpiece, bright fire sparkling grate. It pretty room--it look workshop kind; curious interesting. All round, walls hung clocks strange mechanical toys. There fiddler slowly fiddling, gentleman lady gravely dancing minuet, little man drawing water bucket glass vase gold fish swimming about--all sorts queer figures; clocks even queerer. There one intended represent sun, moon, planets, one face sun another moon, gold silver stars slowly circling round them; another clock tiny trumpeter perched ledge face, blew horn hours. I cannot tell half strange wonderful things were. Griselda interested looking queer machines, she time observe occupant room. And wonder; he sitting front little table, perfectly still, much still un-living figures around him. He examining, magnifying glass, small object he held his hand, closely intently Griselda, forgetting she looking "picture," almost held her breath fear she disturb him. He old man, his coat worn threadbare several places, looking he spent great part his life one position. Yet he look _poor_, his face, last he lifted it, mild intelligent earnest. While Griselda watching closely came soft tap door, little girl danced room. The dearest little girl ever saw, _so_ funnily dressed! Her thick brown hair, rather lighter Griselda's, tied two long plaits her back. She short red skirt silver braid round bottom, white chemisette beautiful lace throat wrists, black velvet bodice, also trimmed silver. And she great many trinkets, necklaces, bracelets, ear-rings, sort little silver coronet; no, like coronet, band square piece silver fastened stand side her head something like horse's blinkers, placed her eyes. She made quite jingle she came room, old man looked smile pleasure. "Well, darling, ready _fête_?" he said; though language he spoke quite strange Griselda, she understood his meaning perfectly well. "Yes, dear grandfather; is not dress lovely?" said child. "I _so_ happy coming too, would get beautiful velvet coat like Mynheer van Huyten." The old man shook his head. "I time things, darling," he replied; "and besides, I old. I must work--work hard make money pet I gone, she may dependent bounty English sisters." "But I will not care money gone, grandfather," said child, her eyes filling tears. "I would rather go living little house, I sure neighbours would give something eat, I could hear clocks ticking, think you. I do not want sell wonderful things money me, grandfather. They would remind you, money would not." "Not all, Sybilla, all," said old man. "The best all, _chef-d'oeuvre_ life, shall sold. It shall yours, possession clock crowned heads might seek vain purchase." His dim old eyes brightened, moment he sat erect strong. "Do mean cuckoo clock?" said Sybilla, low voice. "Yes, darling, cuckoo clock, crowning work life--a clock shall last long I, perhaps thou, pretty child, crumbling dust; clock shall last tell great-grandchildren many generations old Dutch mechanic altogether despised." Sybilla sprang his arms. "You talk like that, little grandfather," she said. "I shall teach children grandchildren proud you--oh, proud!--as proud I you, little grandfather." "Gently, darling," said old man, he placed carefully table delicate piece mechanism he held his hand, tenderly embraced child. "Kiss again, pet, thou must go; thy little friends waiting." * * * * * As he said words mist slowly gathered Griselda's eyes--the first cuckoo's pictures faded her sight. * * * * * When she looked scene changed, time strange one, though Griselda gazed moments she recognized it. It great saloon, looked different she ever seen it. Forty years make difference rooms well people! The faded yellow damask hangings rich brilliant. There bouquets lovely flowers arranged tables; wax lights sending brightness every direction, room filled ladies gentlemen gay attire. Among them, time, Griselda remarked two ladies, longer young, still handsome stately, something whispered her her two aunts, Miss Grizzel Miss Tabitha. "Poor aunts!" she said softly herself; "how old grown since then." But she long look them; her attention attracted much younger lady--a mere girl she seemed, oh, sweet pretty! She dancing gentleman whose eyes looked saw one else, she herself seemed brimming youth happiness. Her steps joy them. "Well, Griselda," whispered voice, she knew cuckoo's; "so do not like told like grandmother, eh?" Griselda turned round sharply look speaker, he seen. And she turned again, picture great saloon faded away. * * * * * One picture. Griselda looked again. She saw her country road full summer time; sun shining, birds singing, trees covered bright green leaves--everything appeared happy joyful. But last distance she saw, slowly approaching, group people, walking together, carrying centre something long narrow, which, though black cloth covering almost hidden white flowers thickly strewn, Griselda knew coffin. It funeral procession, place chief mourner, pale, set face, walked young man Griselda last seen dancing girl Sybilla great saloon. The sad group passed slowly sight; disappeared fell upon ear sounds sweet music, lovelier far she heard before--lovelier magic cuckoo's lovely songs--and somehow, music, seemed child's fancy mingled soft strains woman's voice. "It Sybilla singing," thought Griselda dreamily, she fell asleep again. * * * * * When she woke she arm-chair ante-room fire, everything around her looking usual, cuckoo clock ticking away calmly regularly. Had dream only? Griselda could make her mind. "But I do not see matters was," she said herself. "If dream, cuckoo sent same, I thank much indeed, cuckoo," she went on, looking clock. "The last picture rather sad, still nice see it, I thank much, I will never say I do not like told I am like dear pretty grandmother." The cuckoo took notice she said, Griselda mind. She getting used his "ways." "I expect he hears quite well," she thought; "and even he does not, it is civil _try_ thank him." She sat still contentedly enough, thinking she seen, trying make "pictures" herself fire. Then came faintly her ears sound carriage wheels, opening shutting doors, little bustle arrival. "My aunts must come back," thought Griselda; was. In minutes Miss Grizzel, closely followed Miss Tabitha, appeared ante-room door. "Well, love," said Miss Grizzel anxiously, "and you? Has time seemed long away?" "Oh no, thank you, Aunt Grizzel," replied Griselda, "not all. I have quite happy, cold's ever much better, headache's _quite_ gone." "Come, good news," said Miss Grizzel. "Not I am exactly _surprised_," she continued, turning Miss Tabitha, "for really nothing like tansy tea feverish cold." "Nothing," agreed Miss Tabitha; "there really nothing like it." "Aunt Grizzel," said Griselda, moments' silence, "was grandmother quite young she died?" "Yes, love, young," replied Miss Grizzel change her voice. "And her husband _very_ sorry?" pursued Griselda. "Heart-broken," said Miss Grizzel. "He live long after, know, dear, father sent us take care of. And he sent _you_--the third generation young creatures confided care." "Yes," said Griselda. "My grandmother died summer, flowers out; she buried pretty country place, was not she?" "Yes," said Miss Grizzel, looking rather bewildered. "And she little girl she lived her grandfather, old Dutch mechanic," continued Griselda, unconsciously using words she heard her vision. "He nice old man; clever made cuckoo clock, lots pretty, wonderful things. I do not wonder little Sybilla loved him; he good her. But, oh, Aunt Grizzel, _how_ pretty she she young lady! That time she danced grandfather great saloon. And nice Aunt Tabitha looked then, too." Miss Grizzel held her breath astonishment; doubt Miss Tabitha known she so, she would held too. But Griselda lay still, gazing fire, quite unconscious her aunt's surprise. "Your papa told old stories, I suppose, dear," said Miss Grizzel last. "Oh no," said Griselda dreamily. "Papa never told anything like that. Dorcas told little, I think; least, she made want know, I asked cuckoo, then, see, he showed all. It pretty." Miss Grizzel glanced her sister. "Tabitha, dear," she said low voice, "do hear?" And Miss Tabitha, really deaf she set herself hear, nodded awe-struck silence. "Tabitha," continued Miss Grizzel tone, "it wonderful! Ah, yes, true is, Tabitha, 'there things heaven earth dreamt philosophy'" (for Miss Grizzel well-read old lady, see); "and first, Tabitha, always feeling child strangely like Sybilla." "Strangely like Sybilla," echoed Miss Tabitha. "May she grow good, quite beautiful--_that_ could scarcely expect; may she longer spared love her," added Miss Grizzel, bending Griselda, two three tears slowly trickled her aged cheeks. "See, Tabitha, dear child fast asleep. How sweet she looks! I trust to-morrow morning she quite herself again; her cold much better." VI RUBBED THE WRONG WAY "For comes day When everything goes wrong." Griselda's cold _was_ much better "to-morrow morning." In fact, I might almost say quite well. But Griselda herself feel quite well, saying reminds hardly sense speak _cold_ better well--for cold's "well" means all, existence, short, thing existence say anything it? Children, I feel quite hobble--I cannot get mind straight it--please think give opinion. In meantime, I go Griselda. She felt little ill--a sort feeling sometimes rather nice, sometimes "very extremely" much reverse! She felt humour petted, beef-tea, jelly, sponge cake her tea, day two well. She _was_ petted, she lots beef-tea, jelly, grapes, sponge cakes, everything nice, her aunts, must seen time, really very, kind her every way understood so. But days continued petting, beef-tea jelly rest it, occurred Miss Grizzel, good large bump "common sense," might possible overdo sort thing. "Tabitha," she said her sister, sitting together evening Griselda gone bed, "Tabitha, dear, I think child quite well now. It seems would well send note good Mr. Kneebreeches, say she able resume her studies day to-morrow." "The day to-morrow," repeated Miss Tabitha. "The day to-morrow--to say she able resume her studies day to-morrow--oh yes, certainly. It would well send note good Mr. Kneebreeches, dear Grizzel." "I thought would agree me," said Miss Grizzel, sigh relief (as poor Miss Tabitha last half-century ever ventured anything else), getting fetch her writing materials she spoke. "It satisfaction consult together do. I little afraid hard upon child, agree me, I longer misgiving." "Any misgiving, oh dear, no!" said Miss Tabitha. "You reason misgiving, I sure, dear Grizzel." So note written despatched, next morning when, twelve of the clock, Griselda made her appearance little drawing-room her aunts usually sat, looking, must confessed, plump rosy invalid, Miss Grizzel broached subject. "I written request Mr. Kneebreeches resume his instructions to-morrow," she said quietly. "I think quite well now, Dorcas must wake usual hour." Griselda settling herself comfortably corner sofa. She got nice book read, her father, hearing her illness, sent her post, she looking forward tempting plateful jelly Dorcas brought her luncheon every day since she ill. Altogether, she feeling "lazy-easy" contented. Her aunt's announcement felt like sudden downpour cold water, rush east wind. She sat straight her sofa, exclaimed tone great annoyance-- "_Oh_, Aunt Grizzel!" "Well, dear?" said Miss Grizzel, placidly. "I _wish_ would not make begin lessons yet. I _know_ they will make head ache again, Mr. Kneebreeches _so_ cross. I know he will, he horrid he cross." "Hush!" said Miss Grizzel, holding her hand way reminded Griselda cuckoo's favourite "obeying orders." Just then, too, distance ante-room clock struck twelve. "Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!" went. Griselda could stamped irritation, _somehow_, spite herself, she felt compelled say nothing. She muttered pretty words, coiled herself round sofa, opened her book, began read. But interesting she expected. She read many pages she began yawn, she delighted interrupted Dorcas jelly. But jelly nice she expected, either. She tasted it, thought sweet; she tasted again, seemed strong cinnamon; third taste seemed strong everything. She laid her spoon, looked her discontentedly. "What matter, dear?" said Miss Grizzel. "Is jelly liking?" "I do not know," said Griselda shortly. She ate spoonfuls, took her book again. Miss Grizzel said nothing more, herself she thought Mr. Kneebreeches recalled soon. All day long much same. Nothing seemed come right Griselda. It dull, cold day, called "a black frost"; bright, clear, _pretty_, cold day, sort frost really makes world seem dead--makes almost impossible believe ever warmth sound "growing-ness" again. Late afternoon Griselda crept ante-room, sat window. Outside nearly dark, inside much cheerful--for fire nearly out, lamps lighted; cuckoo clock went tick-ticking briskly usual. "I hate winter," said Griselda, pressing her cold little face colder window-pane, "I hate winter, I hate lessons. I would give _person_ minute I might a--a--what would I best like be? Oh yes, I know--a butterfly. Butterflies never see winter, _certainly_ never lessons kind work do. I hate _must_-ing anything." "Cuckoo," rang suddenly her head. It four of the clock striking, soon he told cuckoo back behind his doors instant, usual. There nothing Griselda feel offended at, somehow she got quite angry. "I do not care think, cuckoo!" she exclaimed defiantly. "I know came purpose now, I do not care. I _do_ hate winter, I _do_ hate lessons, I _do_ think would nicer butterfly little girl." In her secret heart I fancy she half hopes cuckoo would come again, talk things her. Even he scold her, she felt would better sitting alone nobody speak to, dull work indeed. At bottom her conscience lurked knowledge she _should_ looking her last lessons Mr. Kneebreeches, refreshing her memory next day; but, alas! knowing one's duty means thing it, Griselda sat window nothing grumble work herself belief she one most-to-be-pitied little girls world. So time Dorcas came call her tea, I doubt she single pleasant thought feeling left her heart. Things grew better tea, long Griselda asked she might go bed. She "so tired," she said; she certainly looked so, ill-humour idleness excellent "tirers," soon take roses child's cheeks, brightness her eyes. She held her face kissed her aunts meekly reproachful way, made old ladies feel quite uncomfortable. "I means sure I done right recalling Mr. Kneebreeches soon, Sister Tabitha," remarked Miss Grizzel, uneasily, Griselda left room. But Miss Tabitha busy counting her stitches, give full attention Miss Grizzel's observation, she repeated placidly, "Oh yes, Sister Grizzel, may sure done right recalling Mr. Kneebreeches." "I glad think so," said Miss Grizzel, little sigh relief. "I distressed see child looking white tired." Upstairs Griselda hurry-scurrying bed. There lovely fire her room--fancy that! Was she poor neglected little creature? But even please her. She cross pleased anything; cross wash her face hands, let Dorcas brush her hair nicely usual; cross, alas, say her prayers! She huddled bed, huddling her mind untidy hurry confusion, she left her clothes untidy heap floor. She would look herself, truth it; she shrank she _knew_ things going silly little heart unsatisfactory way day, she wanted go sleep forget it. She go sleep, quickly too. No doubt she really tired; tired crossness nothing, she slept soundly. When she woke she felt refreshed rested she fancied must morning. It dark, course, expected mid-winter, especially shutters closed. "I wonder," thought Griselda, "I wonder really _is_ morning. I like get early--I went early bed. I think I will jump bed open chink shutters. I will see it is nearly morning, look sky." She minute, feeling her way across room window, without much difficulty she found hook shutters, unfastened it, threw one side open. Ah no, sign morning seen. There moonlight, nothing else, much that, clouds hurrying across "orbèd maiden's" face rate, one other, light like number pale flashes steady, cold shining frosty moonlight nights. There going change weather, cloud armies collecting together quarters; real explanation hurrying skurrying Griselda saw overhead, this, course, she understand. She saw looked wild stormy, she shivered little, partly cold, partly half-frightened feeling she could explained. "I better go back bed," she said herself; "but I bit sleepy." She drawing-to shutter again, something caught her eye, she stopped short surprise. A little bird outside window-sill--a tiny bird crouching close cold glass. Griselda's kind heart touched instant. Cold she was, she pushed back shutter again, drawing chair forward window, managed unfasten it--it heavy one--and open wide enough slip her hand gently along bird. It start move. "Can dead?" thought Griselda anxiously. But no, dead. It let her put her hand round draw in, her delight she felt soft warm, even gave gentle peck her thumb. "Poor little bird, cold must be," she said kindly. But, her amazement, sooner bird safely inside room, managed cleverly escape her hand. It fluttered quietly her shoulder, sang soft cheery tone, "Cuckoo, cuckoo--cold, say, Griselda? Not very, thank you." Griselda stept back window. "It is _you_, it?" she said rather surlily, her tone seeming infer she taken great deal trouble nothing. "Of course is, should not be? You are generally sorry see me. What is matter?" "Nothing's matter," replied Griselda, feeling little ashamed her want civility; "only, see, I known _you_----" She hesitated. "You would not clambered hurt poor fingers opening window known me--is it, eh?" said cuckoo. Somehow, cuckoo said "eh?" like that, Griselda obliged tell she thinking. "No, I would not _needed_ open window," she said. "_You_ get whenever like; you are like real bird. Of course, tricking me, sitting pretending starved robin." There little indignation her voice, she gave her head toss, nearly upset cuckoo. "Dear me, dear me!" exclaimed cuckoo. "You great deal complain of, Griselda. Your time strength must valuable regret much wasted little me." Griselda felt her face grow red. What he mean? Did he know yesterday spent? She said nothing, she drooped her head, one two tears came slowly creeping her eyes. "Child!" said cuckoo, suddenly changing his tone, "you foolish. Is kind thought action _ever_ wasted? Can eyes see good seeds grow into? They wings, Griselda--kindnesses wings roots, remember that--wings never droop, roots never die. What think I came sat outside window for?" "Cuckoo," said Griselda humbly, "I sorry." "Very well," said cuckoo, "we will leave present. I something else see about. Are cold, Griselda?" "_Very_," she replied. "I would much like go back bed, cuckoo, please; there is plenty room too, you would like come get warm." "There ways getting warm besides going bed," said cuckoo. "A nice brisk walk, instance. I going ask come garden me." Griselda almost screamed. "Out garden! _Oh_, cuckoo!" she exclaimed, "how think thing? Such freezing cold night. Oh no, indeed, cuckoo, I could not possibly." "Very well, Griselda," said cuckoo; "if have not yet learnt trust me, there is said. Good-night." He flapped his wings, cried "Cuckoo" only, flew across room, almost Griselda understood he doing, disappeared. She hurried him, stumbling furniture her haste, uncertain light. The door open, cuckoo got it--"by keyhole, I dare say," thought Griselda; "he 'scrooge' way"--for faint "Cuckoo" heard side. In moment Griselda opened it, speeding long passage dark, guided voice time time heard her, "Cuckoo, cuckoo." She forgot cold, rather, she feel it, though floor uncarpeted old oak, whose hard, polished surface would usually felt like ice child's soft, bare feet. It long passage, to-night, somehow, seemed longer ever. In fact, Griselda could fancied she running along half mile more, last she brought standstill finding she could go further. Where she? She could imagine! It must part house she never explored daytime, she decided. In front her little stair running downwards, ending doorway. All Griselda could see bright light streamed keyhole chinks round door--a light brilliant little girl blinked her eyes, moment felt quite dazzled confused. "It came suddenly," she said herself; "some one must lighted lamp once. But cannot lamp, it is bright lamp. It is like sun; ever could sun shining room middle night? What shall I do? Shall I open door peep in?" "Cuckoo, cuckoo," came answer, soft clear, side. "Can trick cuckoo's get garden?" thought Griselda; first time since she run her room shiver cold made her teeth chatter her skin feel creepy. "Cuckoo, cuckoo," sounded again, nearer time, seemed Griselda. "He is waiting me. I _will_ trust him," she said resolutely. "He always good kind, it is horrid think he is going trick me." She ran little stair, she seized handle door. It turned easily; door opened--opened, closed noiselessly behind her, think she saw? "Shut eyes minute, Griselda," said cuckoo's voice beside her; "the light dazzle first. Shut them, I brush little daisy dew, strengthen them." Griselda she told. She felt tip cuckoo's softest feather pass gently two three times her eyelids, delicious scent seemed immediately float her. "I did not know _daisies_ scent," she remarked. "Perhaps did not. You forget, Griselda, great----" "Oh, please do not, cuckoo. Please, please do not, _dear_ cuckoo," she exclaimed, dancing her hands clasped entreaty, her eyes still firmly closed. "Do not say that, I will promise believe whatever tell me. And soon may I open eyes, please, cuckoo?" "Turn round slowly, three times. That give dew time take effect," said cuckoo. "Here goes--one--two--three. There, now." Griselda opened her eyes. VII BUTTERFLY-LAND "I would butterfly." Griselda opened her eyes. What she see? The loveliest, loveliest garden ever never little girl's eyes saw. As describing it, I cannot. I must leave good deal fancy. It _delicious_ garden. There charming mixture needed make garden perfect--grass, velvety lawn rather; water, little brook ran tinkling out, playing bopeep among bushes; trees, course, flowers, course, flowers every shade shape. But beautiful things Griselda first give much attention deserved; her eyes occupied quite unusual sight met them. This butterflies! Not butterflies uncommon; butterflies, Griselda saw them, I quite sure, children, none ever saw, likely see. There enormous numbers them, variety colours sizes great. They fluttering everywhere; garden seemed actually alive them. Griselda stood moment silent delight, feasting her eyes lovely things her, enjoying delicious sunshine kissed her poor little bare feet, seemed wrap her warm embrace. Then she turned her little friend. "Cuckoo," she said, "I thank _so_ much. This _is_ fairyland, last!" The cuckoo smiled, I going say, would figure speech only, would not? He shook his head gently. "No, Griselda," he said kindly; "this butterfly-land." "_Butterfly_-land!" repeated Griselda, little disappointment her tone. "Well," said cuckoo, "it is wishing yesterday, is not it?" Griselda particularly like allusions "yesterday." She thought would well change subject. "It is beautiful place, whatever is," she said, "and I am sure, cuckoo, I am _very_ much obliged bringing here. Now may I run look everything? How delicious feel warm sunshine again! I did not know cold I was. Look, cuckoo, toes fingers quite blue; they are beginning come right again. I suppose sun always shines here. How nice must butterfly; do not think so, cuckoo? Nothing fly about." She stopped last, quite breath. "Griselda," said cuckoo, "if want answer questions, must ask one time. You may run look everything like, better hurry. You make great many mistakes are--you made already." "How?" said Griselda. "_Have_ butterflies nothing fly about? Watch them." Griselda watched. "They seem something," she said, last, "but I cannot think what. They seem nibbling flowers, flying away something like bees gathering honey. _Butterflies_ do not gather honey, cuckoo?" "No," said cuckoo. "They filling paint-boxes." "What _do_ mean?" said Griselda. "Come see," said cuckoo. He flew quietly along front her, leading way prettiest paths pretty garden. The paths arranged different colours, were; say, flowers growing along sides "mixty-maxty," one shade another regular order--from palest blush pink deepest damask crimson; then, again, soft greenish blue small grass forget-me-not rich warm tinge brilliant cornflower. _Every_ tint there; shades, which, though exactly strange her, Griselda could yet given name, daisy dew, see, sharpened her eyes observe delicate variations colour, she never done before. "How beautifully flowers planned," she said cuckoo. "Is look pretty, why?" "It saves time," replied cuckoo. "The fetch-and-carry butterflies know exactly go tint world-flower-painters want." "Who fetch-and-carry butterflies, world-flower-painters?" asked Griselda. "Wait bit you will see, use eyes," answered cuckoo. "It will tongue harm rest then." Griselda thought well take his advice, though particularly relishing manner given. She use her eyes, she cuckoo made way along flower alleys, she saw butterflies never idle. They came regularly, little parties twos threes, nibbled away, she called it, flowers colour different shades, till got wanted. Then flew butterfly No. 1 perhaps palest tint maize, yellow, lavender, whichever he quest of, followed No. 2 next deeper shade same, No. 3 bringing rear. Griselda gave little sigh. "What is matter?" said cuckoo. "They work hard," she replied, melancholy tone. "It is busy time year," observed cuckoo, drily. After came seemed sort centre garden. It huge glass house, numberless doors, butterflies incessantly flying--reminding Griselda bees beehive. But she made remark till cuckoo spoke again. "Come in," he said. Griselda stoop good deal, she manage get without knocking her head damage. Inside mass butterflies. A confused mass seemed first, she saw reverse confused. The butterflies settled rows long, narrow, white tables, tiny object size flattened-out pin's head, he carefully painting one his tentacles, which, time time, he moistened rubbing head butterfly waiting patiently behind him. Behind butterfly stood another, took his place, first attendant flew away. "To fill his paint-box again," remarked cuckoo, seemed read Griselda's thoughts. "But _are_ painting, cuckoo?" she inquired eagerly. "All flowers world," replied cuckoo. "Autumn, winter, spring, they are hard work. It is three months summer butterflies holiday, stray ones wander world, people talk 'idle butterflies'! And even is not true idle. They go take look flowers, see work turned out, many damaged petal repair, touch faded tint, though one ever knows it." "_I_ know now," said Griselda. "I never talk idle butterflies again--never. But, cuckoo, paint flowers _here_, too? What _fearful_ lot must do!" "No," said cuckoo; "the flowers fairy flowers. They never fade die, always see them. But colours flowers taken them, seen. Of course do not look there," he went on, slight contemptuous shrug his cuckoo shoulders; "the coarse air ugly things must take bloom off. The wild flowers best, thinking; people do not meddle stupid, clumsy way." "But get flowers sent world, cuckoo?" asked Griselda. "They are packed up, course, taken night asleep," said cuckoo. "They are painted elastic stuff, see, fits plant grows. Why, eyes usually, Griselda, could not even _see_ petals butterflies painting now." "And packing up," said Griselda; "do butterflies too?" "No," said cuckoo, "the fairies look that." "How wonderful!" exclaimed Griselda. But cuckoo time say sudden tumult filled air. It butterfly dinner-time! "Are hungry, Griselda?" said cuckoo. "Not very," replied Griselda. "It is well perhaps you are not," he remarked, "for I do not know you would much better dinner here." "Why not?" inquired Griselda curiously. "What dinner? Honey? I like well, spread top bread-and-butter, course--I do not think I care eat alone." "You will not get honey," cuckoo beginning; he interrupted. Two handsome butterflies flew great glass hall, making straight cuckoo, alighted his shoulders. They fluttered minute two, evidently rather excited something, flew away again, suddenly appeared. "Those royal messengers," said cuckoo, turning Griselda. "They come message king queen invite us banquet held honour visit." "What fun!" cried Griselda. "Do let us go once, cuckoo. But, oh dear me," she went on, melancholy change tone, "I forgetting, cuckoo. I cannot go banquet. I nothing night-gown. I never thought before, I am bit cold." "Never mind," said cuckoo, "I will soon put rights." He flew off, back almost immediately, followed whole flock butterflies. They smaller kind Griselda hitherto seen, two colours only; half blue, half yellow. They flew Griselda, felt moment she really going suffocated them, moment. There seemed great buzz flutter her, butterflies set work _dress_ her. And think dressed her? With _themselves_! They arranged her cleverest way. One set blue ones clustered round hem her little night-gown, making thick "_ruche_," were; came two three thinner rows yellow, blue again. Round her waist made loveliest belt mingled blue yellow, upper part her night-gown, among pretty white frills Dorcas herself "goffered," nicely, made fantastic trimmings every shape kind; bows, rosettes--I cannot tell imitate. Perhaps prettiest ornament coronet wreath made her head, dotting her curly brown hair butterfly spangles, quivered like dew-drops she moved about. No one would known Griselda; she _looked_ like fairy queen, princess, least, even her little white feet looked like butterfly shoes upon them, though these, understand, sort make-believe, as, course, shoes soleless. "Now," said cuckoo, last quiet again, every blue every yellow butterfly seemed settled his place, "now, Griselda, come look yourself." He led way marble basin, fell waters one tinkling brooks found everywhere garden, bade Griselda look water mirror. It danced rather; still she quite able see herself. She peered great satisfaction, turning herself round see first one shoulder, other. "It _is_ lovely," she said last. "But, cuckoo, I am thinking--how shall I possibly able sit without crushing ever many?" "Bless you, need not trouble that," said cuckoo; "the butterflies quite able take care themselves. You do not suppose first little girl ever made dress for?" Griselda said more, followed cuckoo, walking rather "gingerly," notwithstanding his assurances butterflies could take care themselves. At last cuckoo stopped, front sort banked-up terrace, centre grew strange-looking plant large, smooth, spreading-out leaves, two topmost leaves, splendid wings glittering sunshine, sat two magnificent butterflies. They many times larger Griselda yet seen; fact, cuckoo looked rather small beside them, _so_ beautiful Griselda felt quite over-awed. You could said colour were, faintest movement seemed change new colours, exquisite last. Perhaps I could best give idea saying like living rainbows. "Are king queen?" asked Griselda whisper. "Yes," said cuckoo. "Do admire them?" "I rather think I did," said Griselda. "But, cuckoo, never anything lie sunshine?" "Oh, silly girl," exclaimed cuckoo, "always jumping conclusions. No, indeed, manage things butterfly-land. The king queen worked harder butterflies. They chosen every then, others, industrious cleverest world-flower-painters, allowed rest, fed finest essences, grow splendid see. But even idle; superintend work done, choose new colours." "Dear me!" said Griselda, her breath, "how clever must be." Just butterfly king queen stretched magnificent wings, rose upwards, soaring proudly air. "Are going away?" said Griselda disappointed tone. "Oh no," said cuckoo; "they welcoming you. Hold hands." Griselda held her hands, stood gazing sky. In minute two royal butterflies appeared again, slowly, majestically circling downwards, till length alighted Griselda's little hands, king right, queen left, almost covering her fingers great dazzling wings. "You _do_ look nice now," said cuckoo, hopping back steps looking Griselda approvingly; "but it is time feast begin, will not us late." The king queen appeared understand. They floated away Griselda's hands settled themselves, time, one end beautiful little grass plot lawn, terrace grew large-leaved plant. This evidently dining-room, sooner places butterflies every kind colour came pouring in, masses, directions. Butterflies small butterflies large; butterflies light butterflies dark; butterflies blue, pink, crimson, green, gold-colour--_every_ colour, far, far colours could possibly imagine. They settled down, round sides grassy dining-table, another minute number small white butterflies appeared, carrying among flower petals carefully rolled up, containing drop liquid. One presented king, one queen, sniffed petal instant, passed butterfly next them, whereupon fresh petals handed them, passed on. "What doing, cuckoo?" said Griselda; "that is _eating_." "It is kind eating," he replied. "They do not require kind food sniff perfume; perfumes extracted every flower butterfly-land, far flowers could count Christmas, must allow plenty variety dishes." "Um-m," said Griselda; "I suppose is. But same, cuckoo, it is good thing I am hungry, is not it? May I pour scent pocket-handkerchief comes round me? I handkerchief here, see. Is not nice I brought it? It pillow, I wrapped round hand open shutter, hook scratched once." "You may pour one drop handkerchief," said cuckoo, "but more. I should not like butterflies think greedy." But Griselda grew tired scent feast long petals passed round. The perfumes nice, certainly, quantities them--double quantities honour guest, course! Griselda screwed her handkerchief tight little ball, one drop scent escape it, she kept sniffing impatiently, till last cuckoo asked her matter. "I tired feast," she said. "Do let us something else, cuckoo." "It getting rather late," said cuckoo. "But see, Griselda, going air-dance now." "What is that?" said Griselda. "Look, you will see," he replied. Flocks flocks butterflies rising short way air, arranging bands according colours. "Come bank," said cuckoo Griselda; "you will see better." Griselda climbed bank, she could look butterfly show, she saw beautifully. The long strings butterflies twisted wonderful way, like ribbons every hue plaiting instant unplaiting again. Then king queen placed centre, round round moving circles twisted untwisted brilliant bands butterflies. "It is like kaleidoscope," said Griselda; "and it is like twisty-twirly dissolving views papa took see once. It is _just_ like them. Oh, pretty! Cuckoo, purpose please me?" "A good deal," said cuckoo. "Stand clap hands loud three times, show you are pleased." Griselda obeyed. "Clap" number one--all butterflies rose air cloud; clap number two--they fluttered twirled buzzed about, greatest excitement; clap number three--they turned Griselda's direction rush. "They are going kiss you, Griselda," cried cuckoo. Griselda felt her breath going. Up her vast feathery cloud butterflies, fluttering, _rushing_ upon her. "Cuckoo, cuckoo," she screamed, "they will suffocate me. Oh, cuckoo!" "Shut eyes, clap hands loud, loud," called cuckoo. And Griselda clapped her hands, holding her precious handkerchief her teeth, she heard give his usual cry, "Cuckoo, cuckoo." _Clap_--where all? Griselda opened her eyes--garden, butterflies, cuckoo, disappeared. She bed, Dorcas knocking door hot water. "Miss Grizzel said I wake usual time morning, missie," she said. "I hope do not feel tired get up." "Tired! I think not," replied Griselda. "I awake morning ages you, I tell you, dear Dorcas. Come minute, Dorcas, please," she went on. "There now, sniff handkerchief. What think that?" "It is beautiful," said Dorcas. "It is big blue chinay bottle auntie's table, is not it, missie?" "Stuff nonsense," replied Griselda; "it is scent own, Dorcas. Aunt Grizzel never like her life. There now! Please give slippers, I want get look lessons Mr. Kneebreeches he comes. Dear me," she added herself, she putting her slippers, "how pretty feet look blue butterfly shoes! It good cuckoo take there, I do not think I shall ever wish butterfly again, I know hard work! But I would like lessons well to-day. I fancy it will please dear old cuckoo." VIII MASTER PHIL "Who comes world flowers? Daisy crocus, sea-blue bell, And violet shrinking dewy cell-- Sly cells know secrets night, When earth bathed fairy light-- Scarlet, blue, golden flowers." And Mr. Kneebreeches reason complain his pupil day. And Miss Grizzel congratulated herself heartily ever her wise management children. And Miss Tabitha repeated Sister Grizzel might indeed congratulate herself. And Griselda became gradually convinced way yet discovered getting hard tasks set work them; also, grumbling, things present arranged world, _always_, I may say _often_, good; furthermore, ill-tempered child not, whole, likely much loved good-tempered one; lastly, wait long enough, winter go spring come. For case year, all! Spring sleepy lazy, case could poor old winter fill vacant post till she came? Why he scolded reviled faithfully his best, he often is, I really do not know. Not ill words he gets much effect him--he comes usual, whatever say him. I suppose his feelings long ago frozen up, surely he would taken offence--well us he done so! But spring come last year, would impossible tell Griselda enjoyed it. It like new life her well plants, flowers, birds, insects. Hitherto, see, she able see little outside her aunt's house; charming inside was, outside, I must say, still "charminger." There seemed end little up-and-down paths alleys, leading rustic seats quaint arbours; limits little pine-wood, led dearest little zig-zaggy path ever saw, bordered snow-drops primroses violets, later periwinkles, wood anemones, bright, starry, white flowers, whose name two people agree about. This wood-path place, I think, Griselda loved best. The bowling-green certainly delightful, terrace famous roses grew; lovely roses (I speaking now, course, later summer, bloom), Griselda could enjoy much wild-flowers, she forbidden gather touch them, except her funny round nose! "You may _scent_ them, dear," said Miss Grizzel, opinion smell pretty word; "but I cannot allow anything more." And Griselda "scent" them, I assure you. She burrowed her whole rosy face big ones; gently, she want spoil them, her aunt's sake, because, too, she greater regard flowers she knew secret painted, great deal trouble butterflies take them. But one grows tired "scenting" roses; even trying walk straight across bowling-green her eyes shut, arbour one side arbour exactly like other, grew stupid, though doubt would capital fun companion applaud criticize. So wood-path became Griselda's favourite haunt. As summer grew on, she began long ever companion--not much play, one play with. She lessons, course, many winter; long days, seemed come quite unaccountable increase play-time, Griselda sometimes found hang heavy her hands. She seen heard anything cuckoo either, save, course, his "official capacity" time-teller, long time. "I suppose," she thought, "he thinks I do not need amusing, fine days come I play garden; certainly, I _any one_ play with, garden would perfectly lovely." But, failing companions, she best she could herself, she loved path wood much. There sort mystery it; might path leading cottage Red-Ridinghood's grandmother, path leading fairyland itself. There kinds queer, nice, funny noises heard there--in one part especially, Griselda made herself seat moss-grown stones, she came often she got know little flowers growing close round about, even particular birds whose nests hard by. She used sit _fancy_--fancy she heard wood-elves chattering breath, little underground gnomes kobolds hammering fairy forges. And tinkling brook distance sounded like enchanted bells round necks fairy kine, sent pasture sometimes upper world hillsides. For Griselda's head crammed full, perfectly full, fairy lore; mandarins' country, butterfly-land, quite real her every-day world her. But time she forgotten cuckoo, see. One day she sitting her favourite nest, feeling, notwithstanding sunshine, flowers, soft sweet air, pleasant sounds about, rather dull lonely. For though May, really quite hot day, Griselda morning her lessons, tried hard, done well, she felt she deserved reward. Suddenly distance, she heard well-known sound, "Cuckoo, cuckoo." "Can cuckoo?" she said herself; moment she felt sure must be. For, reason I know enough habits real "flesh blood" cuckoos explain, bird known neighbourhood Griselda's aunts lived. Some twenty miles south heard regularly, spring Griselda never caught sound familiar note, she remembered hearing never came parts. So, "it must cuckoo," she said herself. "He must coming speak me. How funny! I never seen daylight." She listened. Yes, was, "Cuckoo, cuckoo," plain possible, nearer before. "Cuckoo," cried Griselda, "do come talk me. It is long time since I seen you, I nobody play with." But answer. Griselda held her breath listen, nothing heard. "Unkind cuckoo!" she exclaimed. "He tricking me, I believe; to-day too, I dull lonely." The tears came her eyes, she beginning think herself badly used, suddenly rustling bushes beside her made her turn round, half expecting see cuckoo himself. But he. The rustling went minute two without anything making appearance, bushes pretty thick there, one scrambling pine-wood would rather hard work get through, indeed big person feat would altogether impossible. It big person, however, causing rustling, crunching branches, general commotion, absorbed Griselda's attention. She sat watching another minute perfect stillness, afraid startling slightest movement squirrel rabbit creature kind she expected see. At last--was squirrel rabbit--that rosy, round face, shaggy, fair hair falling eager blue eyes, general look breathlessness over-heatedness determination? A squirrel rabbit! No, indeed, sturdy, merry, ragged little boy. "Where cuckoo? Does _you_ know?" first words he uttered, soon he fairly shaken himself, though means his clothes, free bushes (for ever many pieces jacket knickerbockers, speak one boot half his hat, left behind way), found breath say something. Griselda stared moment without speaking, she astonished. It months since she spoken child, almost since she seen one, children younger herself she knew little time, baby family home, see, big brothers older herself play-fellows. "Who you?" she said last. "What is name, want?" "My name's Master Phil, I want cuckoo," answered little boy. "He camed way. I am sure he did, he called way." "He is here," said Griselda, shaking her head; "and aunts' garden. No one allowed come friends theirs. You better go home; torn clothes so." "This are not garden," replied little fellow undauntedly, looking round him; "this wood. There blue-bells primroses here, shows are not garden--not anybody's garden, I mean, walls round, nobody come in." "But _is_," said Griselda, getting rather vexed. "If is not garden it is _grounds_, private grounds, nobody come without leave. This path leads wood, there is door wall bottom get lane. You may go way, little boy. No one comes scrambling way did." "But I want find cuckoo," said little boy. "I want find cuckoo." His voice sounded almost he going cry, his pretty, hot, flushed face puckered up. Griselda's heart smote her; she looked carefully. He little boy, all; she like cross him. "How old you?" she asked. "Five bit. I birthday summer, I am good, nurse says perhaps I will one next summer too. Do ever birthdays?" he went on, peering Griselda. "Nurse says she used she young, she never now." "_Have_ nurse?" asked Griselda, rather surprised; for, tell truth, "Master Phil's" appearance, she felt sure _sort_ little boy he was, rather sort people he belonged to. "Of course I nurse, mother too," said little boy, opening wide his eyes surprise question. "Have not you? Perhaps you are big, though. People leave nurses mothers they are big, do not they? Just like birthdays. But _I_ will not. I will not never leave mother, way. I do not care much nurse birthdays, _kite_ much. Did care leave off, got big?" "I had not leave I got big," said Griselda sadly. "I left I much littler you," she went on, unconsciously speaking Phil would best understand her. "My mother died." "I am werry sorry," said Phil; way he said quite overcame Griselda's unfriendliness. "But perhaps you have nice nurse. My nurse rather nice; she _will_ 'cold to-day, will not she?" he added, laughing, pointing terrible rents his garments. "These oldestest things; that is good thing, is not it? Nurse says I do not look like Master Phil these, I blue welpet, I look like Master Phil. I shall blue welpet mother comes." "Is mother away?" said Griselda. "Oh yes, she is away long time; nurse came take care farm-house, know. Mother ill, she is better now, day she will come too." "Do like farm-house? Have anybody play with?" said Griselda. Phil shook his curly head. "I never anybody play with," he said. "I would like play you are big. And think could help find cuckoo?" he added insinuatingly. "What know cuckoo?" said Griselda. "He called me," said Phil, "he called lots times; to-day nurse busy, I thought I would come. And know," he added mysteriously, "I believe cuckoo's fairy, I find I am going ask show way fairyland." "He says must find way ourselves," said Griselda, quite forgetting she speaking. "_Does_ he?" cried Phil, great excitement. "Do know him, then? asked him? Oh, tell me." Griselda recollected herself. "You could not understand," she said. "Some day perhaps I will tell you--I mean ever I see again." "But I may see again," said Phil, settling comfortably beside Griselda her mossy stone. "You will let come, will not you? I like talk fairies, nurse does not understand. And cuckoo knows you, perhaps that is he called come play you." "How he call you?" asked Griselda. "First," said Phil gravely, "it night. I asleep, I wishing I somebody play with, I d'eamed cuckoo--such nice d'eam. And I woke I heard calling me, I was not d'eaming then. And I field he called me, I _couldn't_ find him, nurse said 'Nonsense.' And to-day he called again, I camed bushes. And may not I come again? Perhaps tried together could find way fairyland. Do think could?" "I do not know," said Griselda, dreamily. "There is great deal learn first, cuckoo says." "Have learnt great deal?" (he called "a gate deal") asked Phil, looking Griselda increased respect. "_I_ do not know scarcely nothing. Mother ill long time she went away, I know she wanted learn read books. But nurse old teach me." "Shall I teach you?" said Griselda. "I bring old books teach I done lessons." "And mother _would_ surprised she comes back," said Master Phil, clapping his hands. "Oh, _do_. And I have learnt read great deal, think cuckoo would show us way fairyland?" "I do not think sort learning he meant," said Griselda. "But I dare say would help. I _think_," she went on, lowering her voice little, looking gravely Phil's earnest eyes, "I _think_ he means mostly learning good--very, _very_ good, know." "Gooder you?" said Phil. "Oh dear, yes; lots lots gooder me," replied Griselda. "_I_ think you are good," observed Phil, parenthesis. Then he went his cross-questioning. "Gooder mother?" "I do not know mother, I tell good she is?" said Griselda. "_I_ tell you," said Phil, importantly. "She good as--as good as--as good _good_. That is she is." "You mean she could not better," said Griselda, smiling. "Yes, that will do, like. Would good enough us be, think?" "We must ask cuckoo," said Griselda. "But I am sure would good thing learn read. You must ask nurse let come every afternoon it is fine, I will ask aunt." "I need not ask nurse," said Phil composedly; "she will never know I am, I need not tell her. She does not care I do, except tearing clothes; she scolds me, _I_ do not care." "_That_ is not good, Phil," said Griselda gravely. "You will never good good speak like that." "What I say, then? Tell me," said little boy submissively. "You ask nurse let come play me, tell her I am much bigger you, I will not let tear clothes. And tell her you are sorry you have torn to-day." "Very well," said Phil, "I will say that. But, oh see!" he exclaimed, darting off, "there is field mouse! If I could catch him!" Of course he could not catch him, could Griselda either; ready, though, she her best. But great fun same, children laughed heartily enjoyed tremendously. And tired sat gathered flowers nosegays, Griselda surprised find clever Phil it. He much quicker she spying prettiest blossoms, however hidden behind tree, stone, shrub. And he told her best places flowers near by, grew largest primroses sweetest violets, way astonished her. "You are little boy," she said; "how know much flowers?" "I have one else play with," he said innocently. "And then, know, fairies fond them." When Griselda thought time go home, she led little Phil wood-path, door wall opening lane. "Now find way home without scrambling bushes, cannot you, Master Phil?" she said. "Yes, thank you, I will come place to-morrow afternoon, shall I?" asked Phil. "I will know when--after I have dinner raced three times round big field, it will time. That is to-day." "I think would _walked_ three times--or twice like--round field. It is not good thing race you have dinner," observed Griselda sagely. "And must not try come is not fine, aunts will not let go rains even tiniest bit. And course must ask nurse's leave." "Very well," said little Phil he trotted off. "I will try remember things. I am glad you will play again; see cuckoo, please thank him." IX UP AND DOWN THE CHIMNEY "_Helper._ Well, dream, would real, would not? _Keeper._ Yes, I see. I mean, Sir, I _not_ see."--_A Liliput Revel._ _Not_ "just her dinner," feeling much inclined her tea, Griselda ran home great rate. She felt, too, good spirits; delightful companion her play. "What good thing I did not make Phil run away I found nice little boy he was," she said herself. "I must look old reading books to-night. I shall like teaching him, poor little boy, cuckoo pleased something useful, I am sure." Tea quite ready, fact waiting her, she came in. This meal she always herself, brought tray Dorcas's little sitting-room, Dorcas waited upon her. And sometimes Griselda particularly good humour she would beg Dorcas sit cup tea her--a liberty old servant far dignified respectful thought taking, unless specially requested so. This evening, know, Griselda particularly good humour, besides this, full her adventures, she would glad even less sympathising listener Dorcas likely be. "Sit down, Dorcas, tea, do," she said coaxingly. "It looks ever much comfortable, I am sure could eat little tried, whether you have tea kitchen not. I am _fearfully_ hungry, I tell you. You will cut whole lot bread butter 'ladies' slices' either." "How tongue go, sure, Miss Griselda," said Dorcas, smiling, she seated herself chair Griselda drawn her. "And should not it?" said Griselda saucily. "It does not harm. But oh, Dorcas, I have fun afternoon--really, could not guess I have doing." "Very likely not, missie," said Dorcas. "But might try guess. Oh no, I do not think need--guessing takes time, I want tell you. Just fancy, Dorcas, I have playing little boy wood." "Playing little boy, Miss Griselda!" exclaimed Dorcas, aghast. "Yes, he is coming to-morrow, day after, every day, I dare say," said Griselda. "He _is_ nice little boy." "But, missie," began Dorcas. "Well? What is matter? You need not look like that--as I done something naughty," said Griselda sharply. "But you will tell aunt, missie?" "Of course," said Griselda, looking fearlessly Dorcas's face her bright grey eyes. "Of course; should not I? I must ask her give little boy leave come _our_ grounds; I told little boy sure tell his nurse, takes care him, his playing me." "His nurse," repeated Dorcas, tone relief. "Then he must quite little boy, perhaps Miss Grizzel would object much case." "Why she object all? She might know I would not want play naughty rude boy," said Griselda. "She thinks boys rude naughty, I am afraid, missie," said Dorcas. "All, say, excepting dear papa. But then, course, she bringing _him_ her way beginning." "Well, I will ask her, way," said Griselda, "and she says I am play him, I shall think--I know I shall _think_ Aunt Grizzel, whether I _say_ not." And old look rebellion discontent settled her rosy face. "Be careful, missie, do, there is dear good girl," said Dorcas anxiously, hour later, Griselda, dressed usual her little white muslin frock, ready join her aunts dessert. But Griselda would condescend make reply. "Aunt Grizzel," she said suddenly, she eaten orange three biscuits drunk half glass home-made elder-berry wine, "Aunt Grizzel, I garden to-day--down wood-path, I mean--I met little boy, he played me, I want know he may come every day play me." Griselda knew she making her request amiable becoming manner; she knew, indeed, she making way almost certain lead refused; yet, though she really very, anxious get leave play little Phil, she took sort spiteful pleasure injuring her because. How _foolish_ ill-temper makes us! Griselda allowed herself get angry _thought_ thwarted her aunt looked quietly said once, "Oh yes, may little boy play whenever like," she would really, strange distorted sort way, _disappointed_. But, course, Miss Grizzel made reply. Nothing less miracle could made her answer Griselda otherwise she did. Like Dorcas, instant, she utterly "flabbergasted," know means. For she really quite old lady, know, sensible she was, things upset her much easily she younger. Naughty Griselda saw her uneasiness, enjoyed it. "Playing boy!" exclaimed Miss Grizzel. "A boy grounds, you, niece, played him!" "Yes," said Griselda coolly, "and I want play again." "Griselda," said her aunt, "I astonished say present. Go bed." "Why I go bed? It bedtime," cried Griselda, blazing up. "What I done sent bed I disgrace?" "Go bed," repeated Miss Grizzel. "I speak to-morrow." "You unfair unjust," said Griselda, starting her chair. "That is good honest telling everything. I might played little boy every day month would never known, I had not told you." She banged across room she spoke, door, slamming behind her rudely. Then upstairs like whirlwind; she got her room, she sat floor burst tears, Dorcas came up, nearly half hour later, she still place, crouched little heap, sobbing bitterly. "Oh, missie, missie," said Dorcas, "it is I afraid of!" As Griselda rushed room Miss Grizzel leant back her chair sighed deeply. "Already," she said faintly. "She never violent before. Can one afternoon's companionship rudeness already contaminated her? Already, Tabitha--can so?" "Already," said Miss Tabitha, softly shaking her head, somehow made her look wonderfully like old cat, she felt cold evening usually wore fine woolly shawl delicate grey shade, borders her cap ruffles round her throat wrists fluffy, downy white--"already," she said. "Yet," said Miss Grizzel, recovering herself little, "it true child said. She might deceived us. Have I hard upon her, Sister Tabitha?" "Hard upon her! Sister Grizzel," said Miss Tabitha energy usual; "no, certainly not. For once, Sister Grizzel, I disagree you. Hard upon her! Certainly not." But Miss Grizzel feel happy. When she went her room night she surprised find Dorcas waiting her, instead younger maid. "I thought would mind me, instead Martha, to-night, madam," she said, "for I want speak Miss Griselda. The poor, dear young lady gone bed unhappy." "But know she done, Dorcas?" said Miss Grizzel. "Admitted _boy_, rude, common, impertinent _boy_, precincts, played him--with _boy_, Dorcas." "Yes, madam," said Dorcas. "I know it, madam. Miss Griselda told all. But would allow give opinion, is not quite bad. He is quite little boy, madam--between five six--only age Miss Griselda's dear papa he first came us, and, I hear, quite little gentleman." "A little gentleman," repeated Miss Grizzel, "and six years old! That less objectionable I expected. What his name, know much, Dorcas?" "Master Phil," replied Dorcas. "That he told Miss Griselda, she never thought ask more. But I will tell could get hear him, I think, madam. From Miss Griselda says, I believe he staying Mr. Crouch's farm, that, know, madam, belongs Lady Lavander, though good way Merrybrow Hall. My lady pretty sure know child, she knows goes among her tenants, I remember hearing little gentleman his nurse come Mr. Crouch's lodge six months." Miss Grizzel listened attentively. "Thank you, Dorcas," she said, old servant left speaking. "You behaved usual discretion. I shall drive Merrybrow to-morrow, make inquiry. And may tell Miss Griselda morning I purpose doing; tell her also that, punishment her rudeness ill-temper, she must breakfast her room to-morrow, see till I send her. Had she restrained her temper explained matter, distress might saved." Dorcas wait till "to-morrow morning"; she could bear think Griselda's unhappiness. From her mistress's room she went straight little girl's, going softly, disturb her she sleeping. "Are awake, missie?" she said gently. Griselda started up. "Yes," she exclaimed. "Is you, cuckoo? I am quite awake." "Bless child," said Dorcas herself, "how her head run Miss Sybilla's cuckoo. It is really wonderful. There is things people think." But aloud she replied-- "It is Dorcas, missie. No fairy, old Dorcas come comfort bit. Listen, missie. Your auntie going Merrybrow Hall to-morrow inquire little Master Phil Lady Lavander, think it is one her ladyship's farms he his nurse staying, she hears he is nice-mannered little gentleman, comes good parents--why, missie, there is saying you will get leave play much like." "But to-morrow, Dorcas," said Griselda. "Aunt Grizzel never goes Merrybrow till afternoon. She will not back time play Phil to-morrow." "No, next day, perhaps," said Dorcas. "Oh, will not do," said Griselda, beginning cry again. "Poor little Phil coming wood-path _to-morrow_, he does not find me, he will _so_ unhappy--perhaps he will never come I do not meet to-morrow." Dorcas saw little girl worn excited, yet inclined take reasonable view things. "Go sleep, missie," she said kindly, "and do not think anything till to-morrow. It will right, you will see." Her patience touched Griselda. "You kind, Dorcas," she said. "I do not mean cross _you_; I cannot bear think poor little Phil. Perhaps he will sit mossy stone cry. Poor little Phil!" But notwithstanding her distress, Dorcas left her she feel her heart little lighter, somehow long she fell asleep. When she awoke seemed suddenly, she feeling something disturbed her. She lay minute two perfectly still--listening. Yes; was--the soft, faint rustle air she knew well. It seemed something moving away her. "Cuckoo," she said gently, "is you?" A moment's pause, came answer--the pretty greeting she expected. "Cuckoo, cuckoo," soft musical. Then cuckoo spoke. "Well, Griselda" he said, "and you? It is good since fun together." "That is _my_ fault," said Griselda sharply. She yet feeling quite amiable might desired, see. "That is _certainly_ fault," she repeated. "I never said was," replied cuckoo. "Why jump conclusions so? It is bad habit, often jump _over_ them, see, go far. One always _walk_ conclusions, slowly evenly, right foot first, left, one another--that is way get want go, feel sure ground. Do see?" "I do not know whether I not, I am going speak go like that. You might see I do not want lectured I unhappy." "What unhappy about?" "About Phil, course. I will not tell you, I believe know," said Griselda. "Was not sent play me? I pleased, I thought kind you; it is spoilt now." "But I heard Dorcas saying aunt going consult Lady Lavander it," said cuckoo. "It will right; need not low spirits nothing." "Were room _then_?" said Griselda. "How funny are, cuckoo. But is not right. Do not see, poor little Phil coming wood-path to-morrow afternoon meet me, I will not there! I cannot bear think it." "Is all?" said cuckoo. "It really extraordinary people make troubles nothing! We easily tell Phil come till day after. Come along." "Come along," repeated Griselda; "what mean?" "Oh, I forgot," said cuckoo. "You do not understand. Put hand. There, feel me?" "Yes," said Griselda, stroking gently soft feathers seemed close her hand. "Yes, I feel you." "Well, then," said cuckoo, "put arms round neck, hold firm. I will lift up." "How _can_ talk nonsense, cuckoo?" said Griselda. "Why, one little fingers would clasp neck. How I put arms round it?" "Try," said cuckoo. Somehow Griselda try. She held her arms cuckoo's direction, she expected his neck size Shetland pony's, large Newfoundland dog's; and, her astonishment, was! A nice, comfortable, feathery neck felt--so soft she could help laying her head upon it, nestling downy cushion. "That is right," said cuckoo. Then he seemed give little spring, Griselda felt herself altogether lifted his back. She lay comfortably possible--it felt firm well soft. Up he flew little way--then stopped short. "Are right?" he inquired. "You are afraid falling off?" "Oh no," said Griselda; "not bit." "You need not be," said cuckoo, "for could not tried. I am going on, then." "Where to?" said Griselda. "Up chimney first," said cuckoo. "But there will never room," said Griselda. "I might _perhaps_ crawl like sweep, hands knees, know, like going ladder. But stretched like this--it is I lying sofa--I _couldn't_ go chimney." "Could not you?" said cuckoo. "We will see. _I_ intend go, way, take me. Shut eyes--one, two, three--here goes--we will chimney know." It quite true. Griselda shut her eyes tight. She felt nothing pleasant sort rush. Then she heard cuckoo's voice, saying-- "Well, was not well done? Open eyes look you." Griselda so. Where they? They floating top house, Griselda saw them, looking dark vast. She felt confused bewildered. "Cuckoo," she said, "I do not understand. Is I grown little, grown big?" "Whichever please," said cuckoo. "You forgotten. I told long ago matter fancy." "Yes, everything grew little _together_," persisted Griselda; "but is not everything. It is me, us. No, cannot us. And I do not think me, grown little would, eyes have not grown little, everything looks big usual, _you_ great deal bigger. My eyes cannot grown bigger without rest me, surely, moon looks same. And I must grown little, else could not got chimney. Oh, cuckoo, put thinking muddle!" "Never mind," said cuckoo. "It will show little consequence big little of. Make comfortable same. Are right? Shut eyes like. I am going pretty fast." "Where to?" said Griselda. "To Phil, course," said cuckoo. "What bad memory have! Are comfortable?" "_Very_, thank you," replied Griselda, giving cuckoo's neck affectionate hug she spoke. "That will do, thank you. Do not throttle me, it is quite you," said cuckoo. "Here goes--one, two, three," he flew again. Griselda shut her eyes lay still. It delicious--the gliding, yet darting motion, like nothing she ever felt before. It make her least giddy, either; slightly sleepy feeling came her. She felt inclination open her eyes; and, indeed, rate going, she could distinguished little she done so. Suddenly feeling air her changed. For instant felt _rushy_ before, queer, dull sound her ears. Then she felt cuckoo stopped. "Where we?" she asked. "We have come _down_ chimney again," said cuckoo. "Open eyes clamber back, do not speak loud, you will waken him, would not do. There are--the moonlight's coming nicely window--you see way." Griselda found herself little bed-room, quite tiny one, look simple furniture latticed window, she saw she grand house. But everything looked neat nice, little bed one corner lay lovely sleeping child. It Phil! He looked pretty asleep--his shaggy curls tumbling about, his rosy mouth half open smiling, one little hand tossed his head, tight clasping little basket he insisted taking bed him, meaning soon he dressed next morning run fill flowers little girl he made friends with. Griselda stepped side bed tiptoe. The cuckoo disappeared, Griselda heard his voice. It seemed come little way chimney. "Do not wake him," said cuckoo, "but whisper want say his ear, soon I called him. He will understand; he is accustomed ways." Then came old note, soft musical ever-- "Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo. Listen, Phil," said cuckoo, without opening his eyes change passed little boy's face. Griselda could see he listening hear her message. "He thinks he is dreaming, I suppose," she said herself smile. Then she whispered softly-- "Phil, dear, do not come play to-morrow, I cannot come. But come day after. I will wood-path then." "Welly well," murmured Phil. Then he put his two arms towards Griselda, without opening his eyes, she, bending down, kissed softly. "Phil's sleepy," he whispered, like baby almost. Then he turned went sleep soundly before. "That will do," said cuckoo. "Come along, Griselda." Griselda obediently made her way place whence cuckoo's voice seemed come. "Shut eyes put arms round neck again," said cuckoo. She hesitate time. It happened before. There came sort rushy sound; cuckoo stopped, Griselda opened her eyes. They air again--a good way up, too, grand old elms stood beside farmhouse gently waving topmost branches yard two cuckoo poising Griselda. "Where shall go now?" he said. "Or would rather go home? Are tired?" "Tired!" exclaimed Griselda. "I rather think not. How could I tired, cuckoo?" "Very well, do not excite nothing, whatever do," said cuckoo. "Say you would like go." "How I?" said Griselda. "You know far nice places I do." "You do not care go back mandarins, butterflies, I suppose?" asked cuckoo. "No, thank you," said Griselda; "I would like something new. And I am sure I care seeing countries kind, unless could take _real_ fairyland." "_I_ cannot that, know," said cuckoo. Just faint "soughing" sound among branches suggested another idea Griselda. "Cuckoo," she exclaimed, "take sea. It is _such_ time since I saw sea. I fancy I hear it; take see it." X THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOON "That supper time come, And silver dews meadow steep, And silent home, And even nurses asleep, That late, soon, Upon lovely night June They step moon." "Very well," said cuckoo. "You would like look little way, perhaps, Griselda, shall going chimneys, anything kind present." "Yes," said Griselda. "I think I should. I am rather tired shutting eyes, I am getting quite accustomed flying you, cuckoo." "Turn side, then," said cuckoo, "and will not twist neck see shoulder. Are comfortable now? And, by-the-by, may cold, feel left wing. You will find feather mantle there, before. Wrap round you. I tucked last moment, thinking might want it." "Oh, dear, kind cuckoo!" cried Griselda. "Yes, I have found it. I will tuck round like rug--that is it. I _am_ warm now, cuckoo." "Here goes, then," said cuckoo, set. Had ever little girl flight before? Floating, darting, gliding, sailing--no words describe it. Griselda lay still delight, gazing her. "How lovely stars are, cuckoo!" she said. "Is true they are great, big _suns_? I would rather were not. I like think nice, funny little things." "They are suns," said cuckoo. "Not you are looking now." "I like twinkling ones best," said Griselda. "They look good-natured. Are _all_ twirling always, cuckoo? Mr. Kneebreeches begun teach astronomy, _he_ says are; I am sure he knows much it." "He is quite right same," replied cuckoo. "Oh dear me! How tired must be, then!" said Griselda. "Do never rest minute?" "Never." "Why not?" "Obeying orders," replied cuckoo. Griselda gave little wriggle. "What is use it?" she said. "It would nice stood still then." "Would it?" said cuckoo. "I know somebody would soon find fault did. What would say summer; day, night, whichever happened be, see; nothing growing, nothing eat long? That is would stood still, see, because----" "Thank you, cuckoo," interrupted Griselda. "It is nice hear you--I mean, dreadful think of, I do not want explain. I will ask Mr. Kneebreeches I am lessons. You might tell one thing, however. What is side moon?" "There is variety opinions," said cuckoo. "What they? Tell funniest." "Some say unfinished work world kept there," said cuckoo. "_That's_ funny," said Griselda. "What messy place must be! Why, even _my_ unfinished work makes quite heap. I do not like opinion all, cuckoo. Tell another." "I _have_ heard," said cuckoo, "that among places would find country little black dogs. You know sort creatures are?" "Yes, I suppose so," said Griselda, rather reluctantly. "There good many world, course know," continued cuckoo. "But there, much worse here. When child made great pet one here, I have heard tell fairies take his parents nurses think he is sleeping quietly his bed, make work hard night, his particular little black dog his back. And it is dreadfully heavy--for every time he takes his back grows pound heavier there--that morning child quite worn out. I dare say you have noticed haggered miserable ill-tempered children get look--now you will know reason." "Thank you, cuckoo," said Griselda again; "but I cannot say I like opinion side moon better first. If please, I would rather talk more." "Oh, it is bad idea all," said cuckoo. "Lots children, say, get quite cured country little black dogs. It is way--for every time child refuses take dog his back grows pound lighter there, last sensible child learns much better nothing say all, gets way it, see. Of course, _are_ children nothing would cure, I suppose. What becomes I really cannot say. Very likely get crushed pancakes weight dogs last, nothing ever heard them." "Horrid!" said Griselda, shudder. "Do not let us talk more, cuckoo; tell _own_ opinion really side moon." The cuckoo silent moment. Then suddenly he stopped short middle his flight. "Would like see yourself, Griselda?" he said. "There would time it," he added himself, "and would fulfil her wish, too." "See moon myself, mean?" cried Griselda, clasping her hands. "I rather think I would. Will really take there, cuckoo?" "To side," said cuckoo. "I could not take side." "Why not? Not I would care go side much other; for, course, _see_ side here. But I would like know could not take there." "For _reasons_," said cuckoo drily. "I will give one like. If I took side moon would not got there." "Who would I be, then?" "Griselda," said cuckoo, "I told great many things do not know. Now, I will tell something more. There great many things you are _intended_ know." "Very well," said Griselda. "But tell you are going again, going take to. There is harm asking that?" "No," said cuckoo. "I am going immediately, I am going take wanted go to, must shut eyes again, lie perfectly still without talking, I must put steam--a good deal steam--and I cannot talk you. Are right?" "All right," said Griselda. She hardly said words she seemed fall asleep. The rushing sound air round her increased greatly she conscious nothing else. For moment two she tried remember she was, she going, useless. She forgot everything, knew nothing passing till--till she heard cuckoo again. "Cuckoo, cuckoo; wake up, Griselda," he said. Griselda sat up. Where she? Not certainly she she went sleep. Not cuckoo's back, he standing beside her, tiny usual. Either he grown little again, she grown big--which, she supposed, much matter. Only queer! "Where I, cuckoo?" she said. "Where wished be," he replied. "Look see." Griselda looked her. What she see? Something I give faint idea of, children; something strange unlike she ever seen before, dream could see Griselda saw it. And yet _why_ seemed her strange unnatural I cannot well explain; I could, words would good pictures, I know not. After all, sea she saw; great, strange, silent sea, waves. Griselda seated shore, close beside water's edge, come lapping her feet pretty, coaxing way _our_ sea good humour. There faint ripples surface, caused slight breezes came softly round Griselda's face, all. King Canute might sat "from till now" still, lifeless ocean without chance reading his silly attendants lesson--if, indeed, ever silly people, I much doubt. Griselda gazed her eyes. Then she suddenly gave little shiver. "What is matter?" said cuckoo. "You mantle on--you are cold?" "No," said Griselda, "I am cold; somehow, cuckoo, I feel little frightened. The sea strange, dreadfully big; light queer, too. What light, cuckoo? It is not moonlight, it?" "Not exactly," said cuckoo. "You cannot cake eat it, Griselda. Look sky. There is moon there, there?" "No," said Griselda; "but lots stars, cuckoo. The light comes them, I suppose? And where is sun, cuckoo? Will rising soon? It is not always like here, it?" "Bless you, no," said cuckoo. "There is sun enough, rather much, sometimes. How would like day fortnight long, nights match? If daytime now, I could not brought you. It is middle night now, week _your_ days sun begin rise, because, see----" "Oh, _dear_ cuckoo, please do not explain!" cried Griselda. "I will promise ask Mr. Kneebreeches, I indeed. In fact, he telling something like to-day yesterday--which I say?--at astronomy lesson. And makes strange brought to-night see myself, does not it, cuckoo?" "An odd coincidence," said cuckoo. "What _would_ Mr. Kneebreeches think I told I been?" continued Griselda. "Only, see, cuckoo, I never tell anybody I see I you." "No," replied cuckoo; "better not. ('Not could tried,' he added himself.) You are frightened now, Griselda, you?" "No, I do not think I am," she replied. "But, cuckoo, is not sea _awfully_ big?" "Pretty well," said cuckoo. "Just half, nearly half, size moon; and, doubt, Mr. Kneebreeches told moon's diameter circumference respec----" "Oh _don't_, cuckoo!" interrupted Griselda, beseechingly. "I want enjoy myself, lessons. Tell something funny, cuckoo. Are mermaids moon-sea?" "Not exactly," said cuckoo. "What stupid way answer," said Griselda. "There is sense that; either must must be. There could not half mermaids." "I do not know that," replied cuckoo. "They might left tails behind them, like Bopeep's sheep, know; day might coming find again, know. That would 'not exactly,' would not it?" "Cuckoo, you are laughing me," said Griselda. "Tell me, mermaids, fairies, water-sprites, sort creatures here?" "I must still say 'not exactly,'" said cuckoo. "There beings here, rather been, may again; you, Griselda, know this." His tone rather solemn, Griselda felt little "eerie." "It is dreadfully long way home, way," she said. "I feel if, I go back, I shall perhaps find I away fifty years so, like little boy fairy story. Cuckoo, I think I would like go home. May not I get back again?" "Presently," said cuckoo. "Do not uneasy, Griselda. Perhaps I will take home short cut." "Was ever child before?" asked Griselda, little pause. "Yes," said cuckoo. "And get safe home again?" "Quite," said cuckoo. "It is silly you, Griselda, ideas still far near, big little, long short, I have taught you have seen." "I am sorry," said Griselda humbly; "but see, cuckoo, I cannot help it. I suppose I am made so." "Perhaps," said cuckoo, meditatively. He silent minute. Then he spoke again. "Look there, Griselda," he said. "There is short cut." Griselda looked. Far, far sea, silent distance, she saw tiny speck light. It tiny; yet strange thing that, far away appeared, minute was, seemed throw thread light Griselda's feet--right across great sheet faintly gleaming water. And Griselda looked, thread seemed widen grow, becoming time brighter clearer, till last lay her like path glowing light. "Am I walk along there?" she said softly cuckoo. "No," he replied; "wait." Griselda waited, looking still, presently middle shining streak she saw something slowly moving--something light came, nearer got her shorter grew glowing path, behind moving object sea looked brighter appeared. At last--at last, came quite near--near enough Griselda distinguish clearly was. It little boat--the prettiest, loveliest little boat ever seen; rowed little figure first sight Griselda felt certain fairy. For child bright hair silvery wings, every movement sparkled shone like thousand diamonds. Griselda sprang clapped her hands delight. At sound, child boat turned looked her. For one instant she could remember she seen before; she exclaimed, joyfully-- "It Phil! Oh, cuckoo, Phil. Have turned fairy, Phil?" But, alas, she spoke light faded away, boy's figure disappeared, sea shore sky before, lighted faint, strange gleaming stars. Only boat remained. Griselda saw close her, shallow water, feet she stood. "Cuckoo," she exclaimed tone reproach disappointment, "where Phil gone? Why send away?" "I did not send away," said cuckoo. "You do not understand. Never mind, get boat. It will right, you will see." "But go away leave Phil here, alone side moon?" said Griselda, feeling ready cry. "Oh, silly girl!" said cuckoo. "Phil's right, ways he great deal sense you, I tell you. Get boat make comfortable; lie bottom cover mantle. You need not afraid wetting feet little, moon water never gives cold. There, now." Griselda she told. She beginning feel rather tired, certainly comfortable bottom boat, nice warm feather-mantle well tucked round her. "Who row?" she said sleepily. "_You_ cannot, cuckoo, tiny little claws, could never hold oars, I am----" "Hush!" said cuckoo; whether he rowed Griselda never knew. Off glided somehow, seemed Griselda _somebody_ rowed, she heard soft dip, dip oars went along, regularly she could not help beginning count time--one, two, three, four--on, on--she thought she got nearly hundred, when---- XI "CUCKOO, CUCKOO, GOOD-BYE!" "Children, try good! That end teaching; Easily understood, And easy preaching. And find hard, Your efforts need double; Nothing deserves reward Unless given us trouble." When she forgot everything, fell fast, fast asleep, wake, course, her little bed usual! "One tricks again, Mr. Cuckoo," she said herself smile. "However, I do not mind. It _was_ short cut home, comfortable boat, I certainly saw great deal last night, I am much obliged you--particularly making right Phil coming play to-day. Ah! reminds me, I am disgrace. I wonder Aunt Grizzel really make stay room day. How tired I shall be, Mr. Kneebreeches think! But serves right. I _was_ cross rude." There came tap door. It Dorcas hot water. "Good morning, missie," she said gently, feeling, tell truth, sure sort humour "missie" likely found morning. "I hope you have slept well." "Exceedingly well, thank you, Dorcas. I have delightful night," replied Griselda amiably, smiling herself thought Dorcas would say she knew she been, she since last she saw her. "That is good news," said Dorcas tone relief; "and I have good news you, too, missie. At least, I hope you will think so. Your aunt ordered carriage quite early morning--so see she really wants please you, missie, playing little Master Phil; to-morrow's fine day, we will sure find way letting know come." "Thank you, Dorcas. I hope right, Lady Lavander will not say anything it. I dare say she will not. I feel ever much happier morning, Dorcas; I am sorry I rude Aunt Grizzel, course I know I _should_ obey her." "That is right, missie," said Dorcas approvingly. "It seems me, Dorcas," said Griselda dreamily, when, minutes later, she standing window old servant brushed her thick, wavy hair, "it seems me, Dorcas, it is _all_ 'obeying orders' together. There is sun now, getting up, moon going bed--_they_ always obeying, are not they? I wonder hard people--for children, least." "To sure, missie, put way own," replied Dorcas, somewhat mystified; "but I see mean, I think, it is quite true. And _is_ hard lesson learn." "I want learn _well_, Dorcas," said Griselda, resolutely. "So please tell Aunt Grizzel I am sorry last night, I will she likes staying room anything. But, she _would_ let me, I would far rather go lessons usual Mr. Kneebreeches. I will not ask go garden; I would like please Aunt Grizzel lessons _very_ well." Dorcas delighted astonished. Never she known her little "missie" altogether submissive reasonable. "I hope child's going ill," she said herself. But she proved skilful ambassadress, notwithstanding her misgivings; Griselda's imprisonment confined her bounds house terrace walk, instead within four walls her little room, she feared. Lessons _were_ well done day, Mr. Kneebreeches' report could wished. "I particularly gratified," he remarked Miss Grizzel, "by intelligence interest Miss Griselda displays regard study astronomy, I recently begun give her elementary instruction in. And, indeed, I fault find way young lady's tasks performed." "I extremely glad hear it," replied Miss Grizzel graciously, kiss she answered Griselda's request forgiveness hearty one. And "all right" Phil. Lady Lavander knew him; his father mother friends hers, she great regard, time she intending ask little boy spend day Merrybrow Hall, introduced her god-daughter Griselda. So, _of course_, Lady Lavander knew him, could objection his playing Miss Grizzel's garden! And "to-morrow" turned fine day. So altogether imagine Griselda felt happy light-hearted she ran wood-path meet her little friend, whose rosy face soon appeared among bushes. "What yesterday, Phil?" asked Griselda. "Were sorry come play me?" "No," said Phil mysteriously, "I did not mind. I looking way fairyland show you, I believe I have found it. Oh, _is_ pretty way." Griselda smiled. "I am afraid way fairyland is not easily found," she said. "But I would like hear went. Was far?" "A good way," said Phil. "Will not come me? It is wood. I show quite well, back tea-time." "Very well," said Griselda; set. Whether way fairyland not, wondered little Phil thought so. He led Griselda right across wood part she never before. It pretty rough work part way. The children fight brambles bushes, creep hands knees, Griselda remind Phil several times her promise his nurse his clothes worse his playing her, prevent his scrambling "anyhow" leaving bits his knickerbockers behind him. But last reached Phil's favourite spot troubles forgotten. Oh, pretty was! It sort tiny glade middle wood--a little green nest enclosed round trees, right merry brook came rippling along rejoicing getting sunlight while. And choicest sweetest early summer flowers seemed collected greater variety profusion part wood. "_Isn't_ nice?" said Phil, he nestled beside Griselda soft, mossy grass. "It must fairies' garden time, I am sure, I should not wonder one doors fairyland hidden somewhere here, could find it." "If only!" said Griselda. "I do not think shall find it, Phil; but, way, lovely place you have found, I would like come often." Then Phil's suggestion set work make house centre fairies' garden, he called it. They managed much satisfaction, dragging logs wood big stones among brushwood hard by, filling holes bracken furze. "And fairies _do_ come here," said Phil, "they will pleased find house ready, will not they?" Then gather flowers ornament house inside, dry leaves twigs ready fire one corner. Altogether quite business, I assure you, finished hot tired _rather_ dirty. Suddenly thought struck Griselda. "Phil," she said, "it must getting late." "Past tea-time?" he said coolly. "I dare say is. Look low sun got. Come, Phil, must quick. Where place came wood at?" "Here," said Phil, diving little opening among bushes. Griselda followed him. He good guide hitherto, she certainly could found her way alone. They scrambled way, bushes suddenly seemed grow less thick, minute came upon little path. "Phil," said Griselda, "this is not way came." "Is not it?" said Phil, looking him. "Then must comed wrong way." "I am afraid so," said Griselda, "and seems late already. I am sorry, Aunt Grizzel vexed, I want please her. Will nurse vexed, Phil?" "I do not care she are," replied Phil valiantly. "You should not say that, Phil. You know _shouldn't_ stayed long playing." "Nebber mind," said Phil. "If mother I would mind. Mother's good, do not know. And she never 'colds me, except I _am_ naughty--so I _do_ mind." "She would not like late, I am sure," said Griselda distress, "and it is fault, I am biggest. Now, way _shall_ go?" They followed little path till came point two roads, rough cart-ruts only, met; or, rather, path ran across road. Right, left, straight on, be? Griselda stood still perplexity. Already growing dusk; already moon's soft light beginning faintly glimmer branches. Griselda looked sky. "To think," she said herself--"to think I know way little bit wood like this--I side moon last night." The remembrance put another thought her mind. "Cuckoo, cuckoo," she said softly, "could not help us?" Then she stood still listened, holding Phil's cold little hands her own. She disappointed. Presently, distance, came well-known cry, "cuckoo, cuckoo," soft far away, yet clear. Phil clapped his hands. "He is calling us," he cried joyfully. "He is going show us way. That is he calls always. Good cuckoo, we are coming;" and, pulling Griselda along, he darted road right--the direction whence came cry. They way go, wandered far wrong direction, cuckoo never failed them. Whenever loss--whenever path turned divided, heard his clear, sweet call; and, without least misgiving, followed it, till last brought upon high-road, stone's throw Farmer Crouch's gate. "I know way now, good cuckoo," exclaimed Phil. "I go home alone now, aunt vexed you." "No," said Griselda, "I must take quite way home, Phil dear. I promised take care you, nurse scolds one must me, you." There little bustle door farm-house children wearily came it. Two three men standing together receiving directions Mr. Crouch himself, Phil's nurse talking eagerly. Suddenly she caught sight truants. "Here he is, Mr. Crouch!" she exclaimed. "No need send look him. Oh, Master Phil, could stay late? And to-night nights, your----I forgot, I must not say. Come parlour once--and little girl, she?" "She is not little girl, she is young lady," said Master Phil, putting his lordly air, "and she is come parlour supper me, one must take her home her auntie's house--that is I say." More please Phil wish "supper," she really fidget get home, Griselda let little boy lead her parlour. But she moment perfectly startled cry broke he opened door looked room. A lady standing there, gazing window, though quickly growing darkness she could hardly distinguished little figure she watching anxiously. The noise door opening made her look round. "Phil," she cried, "my little Phil; to? You did not know I waiting you, you?" "Mother, mother!" shouted Phil, darting his mother's arms. But Griselda drew back shadow doorway, tears filled her eyes minute two she listened cooings caressings mother son. Only minute, however. Then Phil called her. "Mother, mother," he cried again, "you must kiss Griselda, too! She is little girl kind, plays me; she mother," he added lower tone. The lady put her arm round Griselda, kissed her, too. She seem surprised. "I think I know Griselda," she said kindly, looking her face her gentle eyes, blue clear like Phil's. And Griselda found courage say uneasy she anxiety her aunts would feeling, messenger sent tell her safe farm. But Griselda herself kind lady would let go till she nice supper Phil, warmed rested. "And about, children, lose way?" she asked presently. "I took Griselda see place I thought way fairyland, stayed build house fairies, case come, came wrong side, got dark," explained Phil. "And _was_ way fairyland?" asked his mother, smiling. Griselda shook her head she replied-- "Phil does not understand yet," she said gently. "He is not old enough. The way true fairyland hard find, must find ourselves, must not we?" She looked lady's face she spoke, saw _she_ understood. "Yes, dear child," she answered softly, perhaps little sadly. "But Phil may help other, I perhaps may help both." Griselda slid her hand lady's. "You are going take Phil away, you?" she whispered. "No, I come stay here," she answered; "and Phil's father coming too, soon. We going live White House--the house side wood, way Merrybrow. Are glad, children?" * * * * * Griselda curious dream night--merely dream, nothing else. She dreamt cuckoo came more; time, he told her, say "good-bye." "For need now," he said. "I leave good hands, Griselda. You friends understand you--friends help work play. Better friends mandarins, butterflies, even faithful old cuckoo." And Griselda tried speak him, thank his goodness, beg still sometimes come see her, he gently fluttered away. "Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo," he warbled; somehow last "cuckoo" sounded like "good-bye." In morning, Griselda awoke, her pillow wet tears. Thus many stories end. She happy, happy thought her kind new friends; tears one she felt she said farewell to, even though he cuckoo clock. THE CASTLE IN THE LOUGH THE CASTLE IN THE LOUGH A LEGEND OF DONEGAL "Father," little Dermot would say, "tell something castle lough." Dermot M'Swyne little lad, blue soft eyes bright fair hair. He son Brian, chief M'Swynes, people used sometimes say scornfully he poor puny son come father, he big burly, M'Swyne ought be, slim fair, like girl. However, Brian M'Swyne loved his fair-haired boy, would given pleasures world pleasure little fellow his side listening his prattling voice. He like his mother, said remembered blue-eyed stranger Brian M'Swyne brought home ten years his wife Doe Castle, Donegal, pined years died; perhaps her sake child dear rough old chief. He never tired little lad beside him, many time he would carry cradle his arms, pass his big fingers boy's golden curls, let little hands play his beard. Sitting together firelight winter nights, peat fire burning floor, wind, sweeping across Lough Eske, went wailing round castle walls sighing leafless trees, boy would often get his father tell stories country-side. There many strange legends treasured memories old inhabitants place, wild stories enchantments, fairies banshees; little Dermot would never tire listening tales. Sometimes, he heard half-finished story, he would go dreaming it, till he woven ending, dozen endings, his brain. But tales he used listen one perhaps, other, he liked hear--the story enchanted castle swallowed Lough Belshade. There, beneath waters dark lough, he looked often, castle standing still, gates towers walls perfect, stood upon earth, fires still alight burning hearths, and--more wonderful all--the people sunk it, though fixed motionless enchanted sleep, alive too. It wonder wonders; child never tired thinking it, dreaming time enchantment broken, person break it; for, strangest all, story said must sleep M'Swyne come wake them. But M'Swyne would it? And done? "Father," little Dermot would say, "tell something enchanted castle lough." The legend thus: On shores desolate lough stood great castle, lived beautiful maiden called Eileen. Her father chieftain clan, she his child. Many young lovers sought her, she cared none them. At last came castle noble-looking knight. He traveled far country, he said, he began soon tell wonderful stories Eileen beauty richness land his; skies always blue, sun always shone, lords ladies lived, rough stone-hewn castles like these, palaces bright marbles precious stones; lives long delight, music dancing pleasant things. Eileen listened he told tales her, till she began long see his country; her heart yearned something brighter better sombre life she led shores dark lough; when, time, knight one day told her he loved her, she gave her promise go his home marry him. She contented little she promised knight's wife, spent nearly her time talking her lover picturing herself new beautiful things she going see. She happy, whole; though then, tell truth, time went on, she began little puzzled surprised certain things knight did, certain odd habits he had; for, fact, he odd habits, indeed, and, charming handsome he was, conducted occasionally really quite singular way. For instance, curious fact he never could bear sight dog; ever one came near (and good many dogs castle, quite impossible keep coming near then) he would set his teeth, rise slowly his seat, begin make low hissing noise, craning his neck forward, swelling rounding his back extraordinary way first time Eileen saw she thought he going fit, quite alarmed. "Oh, dear, I--I am afraid you are ill!" she exclaimed, getting upon her feet feeling uneasy. "No, no, it is only--it is only--the dog," gasped knight, gripping his seat hands, needed greatest effort keep still. "Hiss--s--s--s! I have terrible dislike dogs. It is--it is family," said poor young man; he could recover his composure till little animal disturbed carried away. Then he strange fashion amusing his room he slept. It spacious room, hung round arras; often, household gone bed, slept nearest knight awakened sleep noise he made running down, there; scudding floor, even--as far could guessed sounds--clambering walls, though, instead gracious high-bred young gentleman, he veriest tomboy. "I fear, Sir Knight, always rest easily apartment," Eileen's old father said one morning he making even disturbance sort usual. "We rough ways North, perhaps arrangement sleeping quarters exactly liking?" But knight, he began say this, interrupted hastily, declared he never slept comfortably room his life, peacefully, he said; he seldom conscious even much awakening once. Of course, he said this, Eileen her father could open eyes, come conclusion poor young knight somnambulist, afflicted habit running leaping his sleep. Again, too, out-of-doors, odd affected hear birds sing. Whenever began songs, sorts nervous twitchings would come him, he would lick his lips make convulsive movements his hands; his attention would become distracted he would quite lose thread his discourse he talking, thread Eileen's, she talking him. "It I enjoy hearing much," he said once; course he said Eileen could believe him; yet she could help wishing he would show his pleasure way curious one setting his teeth rolling his eyes, looking much he wanted eat birds listen them. Still, spite good many peculiarities, young knight charming, Eileen fond him. They used spend happiest days together, wandering wild beautiful country, often sitting hours rocky shores dark lough, looking deep still water feet. It wild, romantic, lonely place, shut sunlight great granite cliffs threw dark weird shadows it. "Do know prophecy castle shall stand one day middle lough?" Eileen said, laughing, once. "I do not know done, planted somehow middle water. That people say. I should not like live then. How gloomy would great shadows always us!" girl shivered little, stole her hand her lover's, began talk far different place she live; his beautiful palace, far away sunny country beyond sea. She never weary hearing new place new life she going to, beauty happiness going hers. So time went on, last day marriage-day came. Eileen showing her lover her ornaments; she great number precious ones, and, please amuse herself, she putting on, loading herself armlets, bracelets, heavy chains gold, old Irish princesses used wear, till she looked gorgeous princess herself. It sunny summer day, she sat thinking herself, "My married life begin soon now--the new, beautiful, strange life--and I wear ornaments midst it; everything else lovely, he think lovely he now?" Presently she glanced up, little shyness little vanity, see he looking thinking her; she lifted her head, instead finding his eyes resting her, she found---- Well, she found knight certainly thinking her one bit. He sitting staring fixedly one corner apartment, his lips working oddest fashion; twitching way that, parting showing his teeth, he clawing his hands chair he sat. "Dear me!" said Eileen rather sharply pettishly, "what matter you?" Eileen spoke pretty crossly; she various previous occasions seen knight conduct sort way, her feeling less alarm sight simply annoyance moment, she herself thinking tenderly, he could giving his attention thing. "What matter you?" she said; she raised herself her chair turned round her head see she could perceive anything worth looking corner knight staring almost eyes would leap his head. "Why, there is nothing mouse!" she said contemptuously, she looked listened moment, heard little faint scratching behind tapestry. "No, no, I believe not; oh, no, nothing mouse," replied knight hurriedly; still he take his eyes spot, he moved side side his chair, twitched his head right left, looked altogether he hardly knew he about. "And I sure mouse harmless thing," said Eileen. "Harmless? Oh! delicious!" replied knight, much unction Eileen, her turn, opened her eyes stared. "Delicious! quite delicious!" murmured knight again. But moment two more, he seemed recollect himself, made great effort, withdrew his eyes corner mouse still making little feeble scratching. "I mean a--a interesting animal," he said. "I always felt regard mice----" But instant mouse poked his little head beneath tapestry, knight leaped his feet he shot. "Hiss--s--s! skier--r--r! hiss--s--s--s!" he cried; and--could Eileen believe her eyes?--for one instant she saw knight flash past her, nothing living room besides her great black cat clinging his claws half-way arras, little brown mouse his teeth. Of course thing Eileen could faint, she fainted, six hours she came herself again. In mean time nobody world knew happened; she opened her eyes began cry terrible black cat, thought she gone her mind. "My dear child, I assure thing house black cat," her father said uneasily her, trying soothe her best way he could. "Oh, yes, he turned black cat," cried Eileen. "Who turned black cat?" asked her father. "The knight did," sobbed Eileen. And poor old father went room, thinking his daughter going mad. "She quite beside herself; she says man, cat," he said sorrowfully young knight, he met standing outside his daughter's room. "What world could put thoughts her head? Not thing she talk black cats." "Let see her; I bring her her right mind," said knight. "I doubt much," replied chief; he know else do, he let go room, knight went softly closed door, went couch Eileen lay. She lay her eyes closed, her gold chains still upon her neck arms; knight, he trod softly, come quite her side she knew he there. But moment she opened her eyes saw him, she gave scream quite made leap; he bolted door every creature castle would rushed room sound it. Fortunately him, however, he bolted door; stout door, made strong oak, Eileen might screamed hour anybody could burst open. As soon, therefore, knight recovered start she gave him, he quietly took chair sat her side. "Eileen," he said, beginning speak once--for probably he felt matter he come mention rather painful delicate one, quickly he could get he say better--"Eileen, unhappily to-day seen under--ahem!--under unaccustomed shape----" He got far this, Eileen gave another shriek covered her face her hands. "I say," repeated knight, tone annoyance, raising his voice, Eileen making noise really necessary speak pretty loudly--"I say unfortunately seen to-day shape prepared for; I come, love, assure the--transformation--was purely accidental--a mere blunder moment--an occurrence shall never repeated sight. Look again, Eileen, let eve marriage-day----" But knight got say eve marriage-day Eileen never heard, soon he reached words she gave another shriek loud he jumped upon his seat. "Do think I ever marry black cat?" cried Eileen, fixing her eyes look horror his face. "Eileen, take care!" exclaimed knight sternly. "Take care anger me, worse you." "The worse me! Do think I afraid you?" said Eileen her eyes flashing, she high enough spirit, going allow herself forced marry black cat, let knight say he would. She rose her couch would sprung ground, knight bent forward taken her her hand. "Eileen," said knight, holding her fast looking her face, "Eileen, wife?" "I would sooner die!" cried Eileen. "Eileen," cried knight passionately, "I love you! Do break promise me. Forget seen. I powerful magician. I make happy. I give want. Be wife." "Never!" cried Eileen. "Then sealed fate!" exclaimed knight fiercely; suddenly he rose extended his arms, said strange words Eileen understand; appeared her thick white pall spreading her, her eyelids began close, involuntarily she sank back. Once more, dream, she heard knight's voice. "If become wife," he said, "you shall never wife living man. The black cat hold his own. Sleep till another lover comes woo you." A mocking laugh rang room--and Eileen heard more. It seemed her her life passing away. A strange feeling came her, she sinking air; sound her ears rushing water; recollection consciousness ceased. Some travelers passing evening lough gazed spot castle stood, rubbed eyes wild surprise, castle there, bare tract desolate, waste ground. The prophecy fulfilled; castle lifted foundation sunk waters lough. This story Dermot used listen he sat his father's hall winter nights--a wild old story, strange, sweet too, well strange. For living still, legend always said--the chief his household, beautiful Eileen; dead all, sleeping enchanted sleep, till one M'Swynes come kill black cat guarded them, set free. Under dark, deep waters, asleep three hundred years, lay Eileen, her massive ornaments her neck arms, red-gold Irish hair. How often boy think her, picture motionless face, closed, waiting eyes, yearn see it. Asleep three hundred years! His heart used burn imagination. In centuries M'Swyne found bold enough find black cat kill him? Could hard thing kill black cat? little fellow thought. "I would kill I chance," he said one day; he said his father laughed. "Ay, lad, might kill chance--but would get chance?" he asked him. "Do think magician would fool enough leave his watch lough put way? Kill him? Yes, could us kill could catch him; three hundred years passed away nobody ever caught yet." "Well, I may day, I grown man," Dermot said. So he went dreaming old legend, weaving his brain ending it. What be, indeed, his lot awake Eileen her enchanted sleep? He used wander often shores dark little lough gaze shadowy waters. Many time, too, he would sail across them, leaning his boat's side, try vain catch glimpse buried castle's walls towers. Once twice--it might mere fancy--it seemed he saw dark thing surface, he would cry aloud, "The cat! I see black cat!" But laughed he returned home said this. "It big fish bottom water, boy," his father would reply. When he boy he talked story often never weary asking questions concerning it; presently, he grew older, he grew reserved shy, he spoke Eileen color used come his cheek. "Why, boy, falling love her?" his father said one day. "Are unbewitched maidens enough please face earth, must take fancy bewitched one lying asleep bottom lough?" he laughed aloud him. After day Dermot never spoke Eileen his father's hearing. But although he ceased speak her, yet he think dream her; older he grew, less he seem care unbewitched maidens his father talked; maiden he thought love longing one lay asleep enchanted castle lough. So years passed on, time Dermot's father died, young man became chieftain his clan. He straight tall, blue, clear eyes, frank, fair face. Some M'Swynes, rough, burly race, looked scornfully said he fitter make love ladies head men battle-field; wronged said that, braver soldier Dermot ever led clan. He brave gentle too, courteous, tender, kind; fit make love ladies--why, making love ladies almost thing he never did. "Are going bring home wife old house, son?" said his foster-mother, old woman lived her life. "Before I die I would love dandle child upon knee." But Dermot shook his head. "My wife, I fear, hard win. I may wait her days." And then, little while, old woman still went talking him, "How I marry love asleep three hundred years?" This first time he spoken Eileen many day, old nurse thought, like everybody else, he forgotten old legend foolish fancies his youth. She sitting her spinning-wheel, she dropped thread folded her hands sadly her knees. "My son, think her that is good dead? Even could win her, would take bewitched maiden wife?" It summer's day, Dermot stood looking far away sunshine toward where, though he could see it, enchanted castle lay. He stood place thousand times, looking toward it, dreaming old tale. For several minutes he made answer old woman said; he turned round her. "Nurse," he said passionately, "I adored her twenty years. Ever since I first stood knees, told her, she one love heart. Unless I marry her, I never marry woman world." He came old woman's side, though he full-grown man, he put his arms her neck. "Nurse, keen woman's wit; cannot help it?" he said. "I wandered round lough day night challenged magician come try his power me, he hear me, he come. How I reach dark, cruel waters force come fight me?" "Foolish lad!" old woman said. She wise old woman, she believed much everybody else legend castle lough. "What he gain he need come fight you? Do think black cat's fool heed ranting challenging?" "But else I do?" The old woman took her thread her hands again, sat spinning two three minutes without answering word. She sensible old woman, seemed her sad pity fine young man like her foster-son waste his life pining love maiden lain asleep enchanted three hundred years. Yet nurse loved dearly she could bear cross anything, refuse anything he asked. So she sat spinning thinking little while, said: "It mouse made show his shape first, it is mice he catching, I guess, bottom lough. I will tell I will do. I will give half dozen mice bag tomorrow, let loose get water side, see bring up." Well, Dermot think much plan; still, he asked old woman help him, he felt he could avoid taking her advice, next morning his nurse gave bag half dozen mice it, he carried lough. But, alas! soon ever he opened bag, six mice rushed away like lightning sight moment. "That chance soon ended," Dermot said mournfully himself; he took back empty bag his nurse, told her happened. "You goose, did not let one one?" inquired she. "Sure would run opened bag. You made play them." "To sure, I should; I never thought that. I will better next time." So next day woman brought bag again, filled time fat rats, he took lough, laid water side, opened mouth wide enough one rats put his nose; he sat watched, watched, letting rats run away one one; though he sat watching whole day, sign he ever see black cat. At last he came disconsolately home empty bag his shoulder. "Never mind, son, we will try something else to-morrow," said nurse cheerfully. So next morning she brought fishing-rod, large piece toasted cheese. "Take lough bait hook it," she said, "and see black cat will not come take bite. All cats like cheese." Dermot went immediately lough, baited his hook, threw line water. After minutes his heart gave great jump, he felt sudden pull line. He drew softly cautiously; he got water's edge nothing his hook large flat fish--and toasted cheese broken away gone. "What foolish old woman, give toasted cheese put water!" he said himself; he heaved sigh, threw fish his bag, went sadly away. "I dare say villain cat breakfasted nicely toasted cheese without trouble coming it," he said bitterly, he got home. "Never mind; we will maybe better luck to-morrow," replied nurse. "I dreamed dream, dream I thought something else do." So early next morning she brought fat black pig. "What world I this?" said Dermot sharply. "Ah, now, easy, dear," said old woman coaxingly. "Just take lough roast there, sure cat smells fine smell he will come taste." Now Dermot getting rather tired odd things; though he readily gone lough mice rats toasted cheese, yet he relish notion carrying live pig across country two three miles. However, he good-natured, so, although he think good would come it, little he let his nurse persuade take pig. The old woman tied string leg, he took lough, soon he got he collected sticks peat together and, building good big pile, set light it. Then he killed pig his hunting-knife hung fire roast. Presently savory smell began fill air. Dermot withdrew little way, sat behind jutting piece rock, watched, his eyes never leaving smooth surface lough; minute minute passed slightest movement stirred it. From time time he made his fire afresh, turned his pig side side. The whole air around grew full smell roasting meat, savory that, hungry, made Dermot's mouth water; still--there lay lough, quiet smooth, undisturbed glass, dark shadows silent rocks lying across it. At last pig cooked ready, Dermot rose drew fire. "I may well make dinner it," he thought sorrowfully himself, "for nobody else come share it." So he took his knife cut juicy slice, sat again, concealing behind rock, his bow arrow his side, lifted first morsel his lips, when-- Down fell untasted meat upon ground, his heart leaped his lips, surely something last stirring waters! The oily surface broken circles; movement, little splash, sudden vision something black. A moment two he sat breathlessly gazing; then--was he asleep, he waking, really saw it?--he saw water black cat's head. Black head, black paws put swim, black back, black tail. Dermot took his bow his hand, tried fit arrow it; his hand shook, moments he could draw. Slowly creature swam water's edge, and, reaching it, planted feet upon earth, looked warily, green, watchful eye, round; then, shaking itself--and water seemed glide black fur duck's back--it licked lips, and, giving one great sweep air, bounded forward roasted pig smoking ground. For moment Dermot saw it, tail high air tongue stretched lick crackling; then, sharp sure, whiz! went arrow his bow; next moment, stretched flat upon ground, one great dismal howl, lay man-cat, cat-man, arrow his heart. Dermot sprang his feet, and, rushing creature's side, caught throat; he dead already; great, wide-opened, green, fierce eyes seemed shoot almost human look hatred despair, closed forever. The young chieftain took beast, looked it, his might flung lough; turning round, he stretched his arms passionately. "Eileen! Eileen!" he cried aloud; though word broken spell, once--oh, wonderful sight!--the enchanted castle began rise. Higher rose higher; one little turret first; pinnacles tower roof; strong stone walls; until, complete, stood upon surface lough like strange floating ship. And slowly gently drifted shore and, rising water's edge, glided little air, sank last upon earth, fixing firmly stood old, foundations never stirred whole three hundred years. With his heart beating fast, Dermot stood gazing he could never cease gaze. It lovely summer day, landscape round bathed sunlight. The radiance shone gray castle walls made leaf every tree golden glory. It shone bright flowers blooming castle garden; shone human figures began live move. Breathless motionless, Dermot watched them. He close them, near enough see strange quaint dresses, passing fro, like figures started painted picture by-gone age. The place grew full them. They poured castle gates; gathered groups; spread abroad; streamed castle right left. Did know asleep? Apparently not, man went his natural occupation, he paused minute take breath. A hum voices filled air; Dermot heard strange accents, almost like unknown tongue, mingled sound laughter. Three hundred years passed away, yet seem know it; busily went sports labors--as calmly unconsciously never interrupted hour. And, midst all, Eileen? The young chieftain stood looking strange scene him, his heart beating high fast. He killed cat, he broken enchantment, he awakened castle sleep, come next? Did prophecy, said M'Swyne this, say also that, it, he given reward? Nay, said nothing more. The rest blank. But there, then, reward him? Dermot stood suddenly erect crushed certain faintness rising his heart. The prophecy, indeed, said nothing, he would carve rest his destiny himself. And he carved out. He went straight unknown people castle garden found--was he sought? He found lady gathering flowers--a lady rich dress, golden armlets, bracelets, head-ornaments--such discovered tombs. But she dead; she alive young. For she turned round, and, his life's patient waiting, Dermot saw Eileen's face. And then--what more? Well, need I tell rest? What ending could story one? Of course he made her love him, married, lived, died. That whole. They probably happy--I know. You may see little lough still wild country Donegal, deep dark waters hid enchanted castle beneath many years. As castle itself--that, I think, crumbled away; whole story story legend--one pretty, foolish legends old times.
