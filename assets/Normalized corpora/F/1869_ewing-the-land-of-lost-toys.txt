 THE LAND OF LOST TOYS AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE NURSERY. It certainly aggravated offence. It generally understood families "boys boys," limit forbearance implied extenuating axiom. Master Sam condemned back nursery rest day. He always knack breaking his toys,--he unfrequently broke people's; accidents happen, his twin sister factotum, Dot, long-suffering. Dot fat, resolute, hasty, devotedly unselfish. When Sam scalped her new doll, fastened glossy black curls wigwam improvised curtains four-post bed best bedroom, Dot sorely tried. As her eyes passed crownless doll floor floss-silk ringlets hanging bed-furniture, her round rosy face grew rounder rosier, tears burst her eyes. But moment she clenched her little fists, forced back tears, gave vent her favorite saying, "I do not care." That sentence Dot's bane antidote; her vice her virtue. It her standing consolation, brought her her scrapes. It her one panacea ups downs her life (and nursery Sam developed his organ destructiveness ups downs few); form her naughtiness took she naughty. "Do not care fell goose-pond, Miss Dot," said nurse, one occasion kind. "I do not care he did," said Miss Dot; nurse knew feature goose-pond adventure met view it, she closed subject putting Dot corner. In strength _Don't care_, her love Sam, Dot bore much long. Her dolls perished ingenious untimely deaths. Her toys put purposes never intended, suffered accordingly. But Sam penitent, Dot heroic. Fiorinda's scalp mended hot knitting-needle perpetual bonnet, Dot rescued her paint-brushes glue-pot, smelt her india-rubber boiled Sam's waterproof manufactory, long-suffering forbearance. There are, however, said, limits everything. An earthquake celebrated whole contents toy cupboard borne. The matter this. Early one morning Sam announced he glorious project hand. He going give grand show entertainment, far surpassing nursery imitations circuses, conjurors, lectures chemistry, forth, ever amused themselves. He refused confide his plans faithful Dot; he begged her lend toys she possessed, return she sole spectator fun. He let idea suggested sight Diorama taken, he would allow anything kind; proof she liberty keep back her paint-box. Dot tried hard penetrate secret, reserve her things general conscription. But Sam obstinate. He would tell nothing, he wanted everything. The dolls, bricks (especially bricks), tea-things, German farm, Swiss cottages, animals, dolls' furniture. Dot gave doubtful mind, consoled herself she watched Sam carrying pieces board green table cover back nursery, prospect show. At last, Sam threw open door ushered her nursery rocking-chair. The boy certainly constructive well destructive talent. Upon sort impromptu table covered green cloth he arranged toys rough imitation town, streets buildings. The relative proportion parts certainly good; Sam's fault doll's house German farm, his brick buildings, Swiss cottages, totally different scales size. He ingeniously put larger things foreground, keeping small farm-buildings German box far end streets, yet perspective extreme. The effect three large horses toy stables front, cows small Noah's Ark distance, admirable; big dolls seated unroofed building, made wooden bricks architectural principle pound, taking tea new china tea things, looked simply ridiculous. Dot's eyes, however, saw defects, she clapped vehemently. "Here, ladies gentlemen," said Sam, waving his hand politely towards rocking-chair, "you see great city Lisbon, capital Portugal----" At display geographical accuracy Dot fairly cheered, rocked herself fro unmitigated enjoyment. "--as appeared," continued showman, "on morning November 1st, 1755." Never occasion apply Mangnall's Questions exigencies every-day life, date way disturbed Dot's comfort. "In house," Sam proceeded, "a party Portuguese ladies rank may seen taking tea together." "_Breakfast_, mean," said Dot; "you said morning, know." [Illustration: "'Suddenly ground split opened fearful yawn.'"--_Page_ 5.] "Well, took tea breakfast," said Sam. "Do not interrupt me, Dot. You audience, must not speak. Here see horses English ambassador airing his groom. There see two peasants--no! _not_ Noah his wife, Dot, go talking I shall shut up. I say peasants peacefully driving cattle. At moment rumbling sound startles every one city"--here Sam rolled croquet balls box, dolls sat quiet before, Dot alone startled,--"this succeeded slight shock"--here he shook table, upset buildings belonging German farm.--"Some houses fell."--Dot began look anxious.--"This shock followed several others.--" "Take care," she begged--"of increasing magnitude--" "Oh, Sam!" Dot shrieked, jumping up, "you are breaking china!--" "The largest buildings shook foundations,--" "Sam! Sam! doll's house falling," Dot cried, making wild efforts save it: Sam held her back one arm, whilst he began pull boards formed his table--"Suddenly ground split opened fearful yawn"--Dot's shrieks shamed impassive dolls, Sam jerked boards dexterous movement, doll's house, brick buildings, farm, Swiss cottages, whole toy-stock nursery, sank together ruins. Quite unabashed evident damage, Sam continued--"and moment whole magnificent city Lisbon swallowed up. Dot! Dot! do not muff! What is matter? It is splendid fun. Things must broken sometime, I am sure exactly like real thing. Dot! do not speak? Dot! dear Dot! You do not care, you? I did not think you would mind so. It splendid earthquake. Oh! try go like that!" But Dot's feelings far beyond her control, much Master Sam, moment. She gasping choking, last she found breath throw herself her face upon floor bitter uncontrollable sobbing. It certainly mild punishment condemned Master Sam back nursery rest day. It had, however, additional severity, afternoon Aunt Penelope expected arrive. AUNT PENELOPE. Aunt Penelope one dear, good souls, who, single themselves, have, real adopted relatives, interests dozen families, instead one, heart. There people whose youth owned influence least one friend. It may good habit, first interest life-loved pursuit favorite author, pretty feminine art, delicate womanly counsel enforced narratives real life interesting fiction: may periodical return gifts kindness, store family histories one else tell; owe something aunt uncle--the fairy godmothers real life. The benefits Sam Dot reaped Aunt Penelope's visits, may summed heads presents stories, general leaning indulgence matters punishment, lessons, going bed, perhaps natural aunts uncles positive responsibilities young people's education, daily sufferers lack due discipline. Aunt Penelope's presents lovely. Aunt Penelope's stories charming. There generally moral wrapped them, like motto cracker-bonbon; quite inside, speak, abundance smart paper sugar-plums. All things considered, certainly proper much-injured Dot dressed her best, access dessert, dining-room, Aunt Penelope, whilst Sam kept upstairs. And yet Dot (her first burst grief over), fought stoutly his pardon time she dressed, afterwards detected act endeavoring push fragments raspberry tart nursery key-hole. "You GOOD thing!" Sam emphatically exclaimed, he heard her fierce conflict side door nurse found her--"You GOOD thing! leave alone, I deserve it." He really penitent. He fond Dot regret unexpected degree distress he caused her; Dot made much his penitence her intercessions drawing-room. "Sam sorry," she said, "he says he knows he deserves it. I think he ought come down. He _very_ sorry!" Aunt Penelope, usual, took lenient side, joining her entreaties Dot's, ended Master Sam's hurriedly scrubbed brushed, shoved his black velvet suit, sent down-stairs, rather red eyelids, looking sheepish. "Oh, Dot!" he exclaimed, soon he could get her corner, "I very, sorry! particularly tea-things." "Never mind," said Dot, "I do not care; I have asked story, we are going library." As Dot said this, she jerked her head expressively direction sofa, Aunt Penelope casting stitches preparatory beginning pair her famous ribbed socks Papa, whilst she gave Mamma's conversation sympathy, (like her knitting-needles) always service her large circle friends. Dot anxiously watched bow top her cap danced nodded force Mamma's observations. At last gave little chorus jerks, one say, "Certainly, undoubtedly." And story came end, Dot, slowly creeping nearer, fairly took Aunt Penelope hand, carried her off, knitting all, library. "Now, please," said Dot, she struggled chair tall her. "Stop minute!" cried Sam, perched opposite one, "the horsehair tickles legs." "Put pocket-handkerchief them, I do," said Dot. "_Now_, Aunt Penelope." "No, wait," groaned Sam; "it is not big enough; covers one leg." Dot slid again, ran Sam. "Take handkerchief other." "But do?" said Sam. "Oh, I do not care," said Dot, scrambling back her place. "Now, Aunty, please." And Aunt Penelope began. THE LAND OF LOST TOYS. "I suppose people children transfer childish follies fancies them, become properly sedate grown-up. Perhaps I old maid, none, nursery whims stick me, I find liking things, wanting things, quite keeping cap time life. For instance. Anything shape toy-shop (from London bazaar village window, Dutch dolls, leather balls, wooden battledores) quite unnerves me, speak. When I see one boxes containing jar, churn, kettle, pan, coffee-pot, cauldron three legs, sundry dishes, smoothest wood, immemorial red flower one side vessel, I fairly long excuse playing them, trying (positively last time) lids _do_ come off, whether kettle (literally, well metaphorically) hold water. Then if, good ill luck, child flattening little nose window longing eyes, purse soon empty; toddles square parcel one arm, lovely black ringlets white tissue paper other, I wish I worthy asked join ensuing play. Do not suppose generosity this. I done glad do. I found excuse indulging pet weakness. As I said, merely new expensive toys attract me; I think weakest corner penny boxes lie, wooden tea-things (with above-named flower miniature), soldiers lazy tongs, nine-pins, tiny farm. "I need hardly say toy booth village fair tries hard. It tried childhood, I often short pence, 'the Feast' came year. It never tried one occasion, lately, I revisiting old home. "It deep Midsummer, Feast. I children course (I find children, somehow, wherever I go), got fair, children people I known children, love monkey going one side yellow stick coming other, strong heads giddy-go-round hot day diet peppermint lozenges, fathers mothers them. There names--and seemed faces--I knew long ago. A shillings indeed well expended brightening familiar eyes: children me.... Besides, really seem unusually nice assortment things, man intelligent (in reference his wares:).... Well, well! It two of the clock P. M. went one end glittering avenue drums, dolls, trumpets, accordions, work-boxes not; of the clock I came end, shilling coppers pocket, cheered, I cannot say, though I like able accurate time, followed. "I thought best thing I could get fair once, I went village struck across fields little wood lay near. (A favorite walk old times.) As I turned booth, foot struck one yellow sticks climbing monkeys. The monkey gone, stick broken. It set thinking I walked along. "What untold number pretty ingenious things one (not wear honorable wear tear, but) utterly lose, wilfully destroy, one's young days--things would given pleasure many young eyes, kept little longer--things one would value later years, survived dissipating destructive days Nurserydom. I recalled young lady I knew, whose room adorned knick-knacks kind I often envied. They plaster figures, old china, wax-work flowers glass, ordinary ornaments kind. They her old toys. Perhaps she many them, careful she had. She certainly fond them, kept one I ever knew. A faded doll slept cradle foot her bed. A wooden elephant stood dressing-table, poodle lost his bark put red-flannel tongue quixotic violence windmill opposite corner mantelpiece. Everything story own. Indeed whole room must redolent sweet story childhood, toys illustrations, like poem toys verses. She used children play sometimes, high honor. She married now, children her own, birthdays holidays forsake newest possessions play 'mamma's toys.' "I roused recollections pleasure getting wood. "If I stronger predilection love toys, love woods, and, like other, dates childhood. It born bred me, I fancy stay till I die. The soothing scents leaf mould, moss, fern (not speak flowers)--the pale green veil spring, rich shade summer, rustle dry leaves autumn, I suppose old woman may enjoy these, dears, well you. But I think I could make 'fairy jam' hips haws acorn cups now, child would condescending enough play me. "_This_ wood, too, associations. "I strolled leisurely enjoyment, last seated foot tree rest. I hot tired; partly mid-day heat atmosphere fair, partly exertion calculating change purchase articles ranging price three farthings upwards. The tree I sat old friend. There hole base I knew well. Two roots covered exquisite moss ran side, like arms chair, accumulated year year rich, though tiny store dark leaf-mould. We always used say fairies lived within, though I never saw anything go wood beetles. There one going moment. "How little wood changed! I bent head seconds, and, closing eyes, drank delicious suggestive scents earth moss dear old tree. I long parted place I could hardly believe I old familiar spot. Surely one many dreams I played beneath trees! But I reopened eyes hole, and, oddly enough, beetle one like it. I noticed till moment much larger hole used young days. "'I suppose rain forth wears away time,' I said vaguely. "'Suppose does,' said beetle politely; 'will walk in?' "I do not know I overpoweringly astonished would imagine. I think I good deal absorbed considering size hole, foolish wish seized I often longed childhood, creep in. I _had_ much regard propriety see one witness escapade. Then I tucked skirts round me, put spectacles pocket fear get broken, I went. "I must say one thing. A wood charming enough (no one appreciates myself), but, never there, idea much nicer inside surface. Oh, mosses--the gorgeous mosses! The fretted lichens! The fungi like flowers beauty, flowers like nothing ever seen! "Where beetle went I do not know. I could stand quite well, I wandered till dusk unwearied admiration. I among large beeches grew dark, beginning wonder I find way (not I lost it, none lose), suddenly lights burst every tree, whole place illuminated. The nearest approach scene I ever witnessed ground wood near Hague Holland. There, look like tiny glass tumblers holding floating wicks, fastened trunks fine old trees, intervals sufficient distance make light shade mysterious, give effect full blaze reach spot hanging chains lamps illuminate 'Pavilion' open space band plays, townsfolk assemble hundreds drink coffee enjoy music. I reminded Dutch 'bosch' because, wandering time among lighted trees, I heard distant sounds music, came last upon glade lit similar manner, except whole effect incomparably brilliant. "As I stood moment doubting whether I proceed, good deal puzzled whole affair, I caught sight large spider crouched corner his stomach ground his knees his head, spiders sit, looking me, I fancied, pair spectacles. (About spectacles I feel sure. It may two his bent legs apparent connection his prominent eyes.) I thought beetle, said civilly, 'Can tell me, sir, Fairyland?' The spider took his spectacles (or untucked his legs), took sideways run his corner. "'Well,' he said, 'it is Province. The fact is, it is Land Lost Toys. You have not thing fly anywhere you, you?' "'No,' I said, 'I am sorry say I not.' This strictly true, I sorry; I wished civil old gentleman, he projected his eyes intense (I almost said greedy) gaze, I felt quite frightened. "'How pass sentries?' he inquired. "'I never saw any,' I answered. "'You could not seen anything did not see them,' he said; 'but perhaps do not know. They are glow-worms. Six tree, light road, challenge passers-by. Why did not challenge you?' "'I do not know,' I began, 'unless beetle----' "'I do not like beetles,' interrupted spider, stretching leg turn sticking him,  she will, flavor. You never tried walking anything sort, you?' he pointed one leg long thread fastened web his head. "'Certainly not,' said I. "'I am afraid would not bear you,' he observed slowly. "'I am quite sure would not,' I hastened reply. 'I would not try worlds. It would spoil pretty work moment. Good-evening.' "And I hurried forward. Once I looked back, spider following me. He his hole again, his stomach, his knees his head, looking (apparently his spectacles) road I came. "I soon forgot sight me. I reached open place lights music; shall I describe spectacle I beheld? "I spoken effect toy-shop feelings. Now imagine toy-fair, brighter gayer brightest bazaar ever seen, held open glade, forest-trees stood majestically behind glittering stalls, stretched gigantic arms heads, brilliant thousand hanging lamps. At moment entrance silent quiet. The toys lay places looking incredibly attractive I reflected disgust ready cash, except one shilling coppers, melted away amid tawdry fascinations village booth. I counting coppers (sevenpence halfpenny), moment dozen sixpenny fiddles leaped places began play, accordions sizes joined them, drumsticks beat upon drums, penny trumpets sounded, yellow flutes took melody high notes, bore away trees. It weird fairy-music, quite delightful. The nearest approach I know ground hear wild dreamy air well whistled pianoforte accompaniment. "When music began, toys rose. The dolls jumped began dance. The poodles barked, pannier donkeys wagged ears, windmills turned, puzzles put together, bricks built houses, balls flew side side, battle-doors shuttlecocks kept among themselves, skipping-ropes went round, hoops ran off, sticks went them, cobbler's wax tails green frogs gave way, jumped moment, whilst old-fashioned go-cart ran madly nobody inside. It exhilarating. "I soon became aware beetle elbow. "'There beautiful toys here,' I said. "'Well, yes,' he replied, 'and odd-looking ones, too. You see, whatever really used child plaything gets right come end; queer company, I assure you. Look there.' "I looked, said, 'It seems potato.' "'So is,' said beetle. 'It belonged Irish child one great cities. But child belonged I do not know, I do not think he knew himself. He lived corner dirty, over-crowded room, corner, one day, potato rolled. It plaything he ever had. He stuck two cinders eyes, scraped nose mouth, loved it. He sat upon day, fear taken him, dark he took played it. He often hungry, he never ate potato. When he died rolled corner, swept ashes. Then came here.' "'What sad story!' I exclaimed. "The beetle seemed way affected. "'It curious thing,' he rambled on, 'that potato takes quite good place among toys. You see, rank precedence entirely question age; is, length time plaything possession child; kinds ugly old things hold first rank; whereas costly beautiful works art often smashed lost, spoilt children rich people, two three days. If care sad stories, another queer thing belonging child died.' "It appeared large sheet canvas strange kind needlework upon it. "'It belonged little girl rich household,' beetle continued; 'she invalid, difficult amuse. We lots her toys, pretty ones too. At last one taught her make caterpillars wool-work. A bit work done certain stitch cut scissors, made look like hairy caterpillar. The child took this, cared nothing else. Wool every shade procured her, she made caterpillars colors. Her complaint turn butterflies. However, she sweet, gentle-tempered child, she went on, hoping would so, making new ones. One day she heard talking laughing her bed joy. She said caterpillars become butterflies many colors, room full them. In happy fancy she died.' "'And caterpillars came here?' "'Not long time,' said beetle; 'her mother kept _she_ lived, lost came down. No toys come till broken lost.' "'What sticks here?' I asked. "The music ceased, toys lying quiet. Up corner leaned large bundle walking-sticks. They often sold toy-shops, I wondered grounds came here. "'Did ever meet benevolent old gentleman wondering earth his sticks go to?' said beetle. 'Why lend grandchildren? The young rogues use hobby-horses lose them, come, sentinels cannot stop them. The real hobby-horses will not allow ride them, however. There meeting subject. Every stick put examination. 'Where nose? Where mane? Where wheels?' The last poser. Some got noses, none got wheels. So true hobby-horses. Something kind occurred elder whistles.' "'The what?' I asked. "'Whistles boys make elder sticks pith scooped out,' said beetle. 'The real instruments would allow play them. The elder-whistles said would joined asked. They amateurs, never played professionals. So private concerts combs curl-papers. But, bless you, toys kind endless here! Teetotums made old cotton reels, tea-sets acorn cups, dinner-sets old shells, monkeys made bits sponge, sorts things made breastbones merrythoughts, old packs cards always building houses getting knocked band begins play, feathers, rabbits' tails---- "'Ah! I heard rabbits' tails,' I said. "'There are,' beetle continued; 'and band plays see skip run. I do not believe would find bodies, experience warren is, rabbits skip run tails chiefly see. But amateur toys successful boats. We lake craft, know, there is quite fleet boats made old cork floats fishing villages. Then, see, old bits cork really sea, seen good deal service herring nets, quite take lead smart shop ships, never beyond pond tub water. But that is exception. Amateur toys mostly dowdy. Look box.' "I looked, thought I must seen before, wondered common-looking box without lid affect strangely, memory seem struggling bring back past. Suddenly came me--it old Toy Box. "I completely forgotten nursery institution till recalled familiar aspect inside, papered proof-sheets old novel black stars stamped way ornament.

"'What staring at?' said beetle. "'It is old Toy Box!' I exclaimed. "The beetle rolled his back, struggled helplessly his legs: I turned over. (Neither first last time showing attention beetles.) "'That is right,' he said, 'set legs. What turn gave me! You do not mean say toys here? If have, sooner make way home better.' "'Why?' I inquired. "'Well,' he said, 'there is strong feeling place. The toys think ill-treated, taken care children general. And truth it. Toys come scores broken first day. And quite resolved old masters mistresses come way shall punished.' "'How punished?' I inquired. "'Exactly toys, toys them. All perfectly fair regular.' "'I do not know I treated mine particularly badly,' I said; 'but I think I would rather go.' "'I think you would better,' said beetle. 'Good-evening!' I saw more. "I turned go, somehow I lost road.

"Now, Dot, that is truly unkind you. I thought forgotten." "So is," said Dot, getting up. "I joking. What idea?" "I do not think I shall tell till I finished shop. I want get now, I wish would take turn glue-pot." Sam apt want change occupation. Dot, hand, equally averse leaving she till finished, suited like Jack Sprat his wife. It effort Dot leave night-dress she hoped finish sitting; she fairly set work glue business she never moved till glue working order, her face red ripe tomato. By time Sam set business window-seat, fastening large paper inscription his shop. It ran thus:-- MR. SAM, _Dolls Doctor Toymender Her Majesty Queen, Potentates._ "Splendid!" shouted Dot, serving glue kettle soup, looked herself like overtoasted cook. Sam took glue, began bustle about. "Now, Dot, get broken toys, we will see do. And here is second splendid idea. Do see box? Into shall put toys quite spoiled cannot possibly mended. It called Hospital Incurables. I have got placard that. At least it is written yet, here is paper, perhaps would write it, Dot, I tired writing I want begin mending." "For future," he presently resumed, "when I want doll scalp behead, I shall apply Hospital Incurables, toy I want destroy. And see, dear Dot, I shall quite blessing nursery; I shall attend dolls gratis, keep furniture repair." Sam really kept his word. He natural turn mechanical work, and, backed Dot's methodical genius, he prolonged days broken toys skillful mending, acquired interest still favorable preservation. When his birthday came round, months events, Dot (assisted Mamma Aunt Penelope), prepared surprise equal his "splendid ideas." The whole force toy cupboard assembled nursery table, present Sam fine box joiner's tools reward his services, Papa kindly acting spokesman occasion. And certain gaps china tea-set, scars dolls' faces, good many new legs, amongst furniture animals, remaining traces Sam's earthquake. THE BROWNIES. A little girl sat sewing crying garden seat. She fair floating hair, breeze blew her eyes; cloud hair, mist tears, she could see her work clearly. She neither tied her locks, dried her eyes, however; one miserable, one may well completely so. "What matter?" said Doctor, friend Rector's, came garden whenever he pleased. The Doctor tall stout man, hair black crows' feathers top, gray underneath, bushy beard. When young, he slim handsome, wonderful eyes, wonderful still; many years past. He great love children, one particular friend his. "What matter?" said he. "I am row," murmured young lady her veil; needle went damp, came jerk, apt result ladies called "puckering." "You like London yellow fog," said Doctor, throwing grass, "and depressing feelings. What row about, came get it?" "We are it," reply; apparently fog thickening, voice grew less less distinct--"the boys everybody. It is forgetting, putting away, leaving about, borrowing, breaking, sort thing. I have father's new pocket-handkerchiefs hem, I have climbing boys, kept forgetting forgetting, mother says I always forget; I cannot help it. I forget tidy his newspapers him, I forget feed Puss, I forgot these; besides, they are great bore, mother gave Nurse do, one lost, found morning tossing toy-cupboard." "It looks taking violent exercise," said Doctor. "But boys it?" "Why, regular turn toys," she explained, "and they are regular mess. You know, always go till last minute, things get crammed anyhow. Mary I tidy twice; boys never put anything away, know, what is good?" "What, indeed!" said Doctor. "And complained them?" "Oh! no!" answered she. "We do not get rows, unless provoking; things theirs, everybody sent for, I sent finish this, tidying. I do not know done, I side hem: soldier's box broken, Noah lost Noah's Ark, one elephants guinea-pig, rocking-horse's nose: nobody knows become Rutlandshire Wash, they are small, I do not wonder; North America Europe gone too." The Doctor started affected horror. "Europe gone, say? Bless me! become us!" "Do not!" said young lady, kicking petulantly her dangling feet, trying laugh. "You know I mean puzzles; yours, would not like it." "I do not half like is," said Doctor. "I seriously alarmed. An earthquake one thing: good shaking, settle again. But Europe gone--lost--Why, comes Deordie, I declare, looking much cheerful do; let us humbly hope Europe found. At present I feel like Aladdin his palace transported magician; I do not know I am." "You are here, Doctor; are not you?" asked slow curly-wigged brother, squatting grass. "_Is_ Europe found?" said Doctor tragically. "Yes," laughed Deordie. "I found it." "You great man," said Doctor. "And--it common charity ask--how North America?" "Found too," said Deordie. "But Wash completely lost." "And six shirts it!" said Doctor. "I sent last Saturday ever was. What world live in! Any news? Poor Tiny crying her eyes out." "I am sorry, Tiny," said brother. "But do not bother it. It is square now, we are going new shelf put up." "Have found everything?" asked Tiny. "Well, Wash, know. And elephant guinea-pig gone good; elephant guinea-pig must walk together pair now. Noah among soldiers, put cavalry night-light box. Europe North America behind book-case; and, would believe it? rocking-horse's nose turned nursery oven." "I cannot believe it," said Doctor. "The rocking-horse's nose could not turn up, purest Grecian, modelled Elgin marbles. Perhaps heat it, though. However, seem got troubles well, Master Deordie. I wish poor Tiny end her task." "So I," said Deordie ruefully. "But I tell I have thinking, Doctor. Nurse always knagging us, we are always rows one sort another, this, that, leaving things about. But, know, it is horrid shame, plenty servants, I do not see always bothering little things, and--" "Oh! come point, please," said Doctor; "you go round square so, telling stories, Deordie. What thinking of?" "Well," said Deordie, good tempered he slow, "the day Nurse shut back nursery borrowing her scissors losing them; I would got 'Grimm' inside one knickerbockers, she locked door, I sat read. And I read story Shoemaker little Elves came his work he got up; I thought would jolly little Elves things instead us." "That is Tommy Trout said," observed Doctor. "Who is Tommy Trout?" asked Deordie. "Do not know, Deor?" said Tiny. "It is good boy pulled cat what is-his-name. 'Who pulled her out? Little Tommy Trout.' "Is Tommy Trout, Doctor? I never heard anything else except his pulling cat out; I cannot think he that." "Let bucket her, course," said Doctor. "But listen me. If get handkerchief done, take mother kiss, keep waiting, I will tea, tell story Tommy Trout." "This night?" shouted Deordie. "This night." "Every one us?" inquired young gentleman rapturous incredulity. "Every one you.--Now Tiny, work?" "It is done," said Tiny.--"Oh! Deordie, climb behind, hold back hair, there is darling, I fasten off. Oh! Deor, you are pulling hair out. Do not." "I want make pig-tail," said Deor. "You cannot," said Tiny, feminine contempt. "You cannot plait. What is good asking boys anything? There! it is done last. Now go ask mother may go.--Will let come, doctor," she inquired, "if I said?" "To sure I will," he answered. "Let look you. Your eyes swollen crying. How silly little goose?" "Did never cry?" asked Tiny. "When I age? Well, perhaps so." "You have never cried since, surely," said Tiny. The Doctor absolutely blushed. "What think?" said he. "Oh, course not," she answered. "You have nothing cry about. You are grown up, live alone beautiful house, like, never get rows, anybody think about; nasty pocket-handkerchiefs hem." "Very nice; eh, Deordie?" said Doctor. "Awfully jolly," said Deordie. "Nothing else wish for, eh?" "_I_ keep harriers, poodle, I man," said Deordie; "but I suppose could, wanted to." "Nothing cry about, rate?" "I think not!" said Deordie.--"There is mother, though; let us go ask her tea;" ran. The Doctor stretched his six feet length upon sward, dropped his gray head little heap newly-mown grass, looked sky. "Awfully jolly--no nasty pocket-handkerchiefs hem," said he, laughing himself. "Nothing else wish for; nothing cry about." Nevertheless, he lay still, staring sky, till smile died away, tears came his eyes. Fortunately, one see. What could "awfully jolly" Doctor thinking make cry? He thinking grave-stone churchyard close by, story connected grave-stone known everybody place old enough remember it. This story nothing present story, ought told. And yet Doctor, short, shall put in, all. THE STORY OF A GRAVE-STONE. One early spring morning, twenty years before, man, going his work sunrise churchyard, stopped flat stone he lately helped lay down. The day before, name cut it, he stayed read; name one scrawled words pencil, he read also--_Pitifully behold sorrows hearts_. On stone lay pencil, feet lay Doctor, face downwards, he lain night, hoar frost his black hair. Ah! grave-stones (they ugly things days; light, hopeful, pretty crosses set now), seem remorselessly imprison keep dear dead friends away us! And yet lie feather's weight upon souls gone, God knows heavily press upon souls left behind. Did spirit whose body dead, stand morning body whose spirit dead, pity him? Let us talk know. After said Doctor got fever, dying, he got better it; he his mind, he got better that, came looking much usual, except his hair never seemed quite black again, little night's hoar frost still remained. And misfortune happened I ever heard of; time went he grew beard, got stout, kept German poodle, gave tea parties people's children. As grave-stone story, whatever end twenty years, great convenience his friends; he said anything did not agree with, anything could not understand, did not say expected him, could easier conclusive shake one's head say, "The fact is, Doctor little odd, _ever since_--!" THE DOCTOR'S TEA PARTY. There one great advantage attendant upon invitations tea doctor. No objections raised score health. It obvious must fine enough go doctor asks you, his tea-cakes may eaten perfect impunity. Those tea-cakes always good; to-night utterly delicious; perfect _abandon_ currants, amount citron peel enervating behold. Then housekeeper waited awful splendor, yet Doctor's authority her seemed absolute he Eastern despot. Deordie must excused believing charms living alone. It certainly advantages. The limited sphere duty conduces discipline household, demand exceed supply article waiting, general scrimmage conflicting interests besets large family favored circumstances. The housekeeper waits black silk looks she meaner occupation sit rocking chair, dream damson cheese. Rustling, hospitable, subservient, one retired last, and-- "Now," said Doctor, "for verandah; look moon." The company adjourned rush, rear brought poodle, seemed quite used proceedings; verandah, framed passion flowers geraniums, Doctor gathered mats, rugs, cushions, arm-chairs, party; far sky, yellow-faced harvest moon looked awful benignity. "Now!" said Doctor. "Take seats. Ladies first, gentlemen afterwards. Mary Tiny race American rocking-chair. Well done! Of course hold both. Now boys, shake down. No one sit stone, put feet grass; you are ready, I will begin." "We are ready," said girls. The boys shook minutes more, Doctor began story "THE BROWNIES." "Bairns burden," said Tailor he sat work. He lived village glorious moors north England; bairns he meant children, every Northman knows. "Bairns burden," he sighed. "Bairns blessing," said old lady window. "It family motto. The Trouts large families good luck generations; is, till you are grandfather's time. He one son. I married him. He good husband, he spoilt child. He always used waited upon, he could not fash look farm his own. We six children. They dead you, youngest. You bound tailor. When farm came hands, wife died, never looked since. The land sold now, house. No! no! you are right enough there; you have troubles, son Thomas, lads _are_ idle!'" It Tailor's mother spoke. She old woman, helpless. She quite bright her intellect she been, got muddled things lately happened; she clear memory long past, pertinacious her opinions. She knew private history almost every family place, Trouts buried old stones churchyard; tales ghosts, doubles, warnings, fairies, witches, hobgoblins, like, even her grandchildren ever come end of. Her hands trembled age, she regretted nothing danger brought her spilling salt. She past house-work, day she sat knitting hearth-rugs bits scraps cloth shred tailoring. How far she believed wonderful tales she told, odd little charms she practised, one exactly knew; older she grew, stranger things she remembered, testy she one doubted truth. "Bairns blessing!" said she. "It family motto." "_Are they?_" said Tailor emphatically. He high respect his mother, like contradict her, he held his opinion, based upon personal experience; metaphysician, understand safer found opinions principles experience, since experience may alter, principles cannot. "Look Tommy," he broke suddenly. "That boy nothing whittle sticks morning till night. I almost lug bed mornings. If I send errand, he loiters; I would better gone myself. If I set anything, I tell everything; I could sooner myself. And he work, it is done unwillingly, poor grace; better, far better, myself. What house-work boys ever looking baby? And afternoon she asleep cradle, went, she awoke, _I_ must leave work take her. _I_ gave her her supper, put her bed. And want I get, take play lose, bring play leave about, bairns give trouble, Mother, I have easy life it. The pay poor enough one get work, work hard enough one clear day in; housekeeping bairn-minding do not leave man much time his trade. No! no! Madam, luck Trouts gone, 'Bairns burden,' motto now. Though one's own," he muttered himself, "and bad ones, I hope would blessing." "There is Johnnie," murmured old lady, dreamily, "He face like apple." "And useful," said Tailor. "He might different, his brother leads nose." His brother led Tailor spoke, literally his snub, though, hand. They handsome pair, lazy couple. Johnnie especially largest roundest foreheads, reddest cheeks, brightest eyes, quaintest twitchy chins, looked altogether like gutta percha cherub chronic state longitudinal squeeze. They locked together two grubby paws, armful moss, deposited floor came in. "I have swept floor to-day," said father, "and I am going again. Put rubbish outside." "Move Johnnie!" said his brother, seating stool, taking his knife piece wood, he cut sliced; apple-cheeked Johnnie stumbled stamped moss, scraped door-step, leaving long trails earth behind him, sat also. "And chips same," added Tailor; "I _not_ clear litter lads make." "Pick  them up, Johnnie," said Thomas Trout, junior, exasperated sigh; apple tumbled up, rolled flying chips, tumbled again. "Is supper, Father?" asked Tommy. "No, not, Sir, unless know get it," said Tailor; taking his pipe, he went house. "Is really nothing eat Granny?" asked boy. "No, bairn, bread breakfast to-morrow." "What makes Father cross, Granny?" "He is wearied, do not help him, dear." "What could I do, Grandmother?" "Many little things, tried," said old lady. "He spent half-an-hour to-day moor, getting turf fire, could got well, he his work." "He never told me," said Tommy. "You might help bit now, would, laddie," said old lady coaxingly; "these bits cloth want tearing lengths, get  them ready, I go knitting. There will food mat done sold." "I will try," said Tommy, lounging desperate resignation. "Hold knife, Johnnie. Father's cross, everything miserable, ever since farm sold. I wish I big man, could make fortune.--Will do, Granny?" The old lady put her knitting looked. "My dear, that is short. Bless me! I gave lad piece measure by." "I thought length. Oh, dear! I tired;" he propped old lady's chair. "My dear! do not lean so! you will tipple over!" she shrieked. "I beg pardon, Grandmother. Will _that_ do?" "It is much long." "Tear bit off. Now it is right." "But, dear, wastes it. Now bit use. There goes knitting, awkward lad!" "Johnnie, pick up!--Oh! Grandmother, I _am_ hungry." The boy's eyes filled tears, old lady melted instant. "What I you, poor bairns?" said she. "There, never mind scraps, Tommy." "Tell us tale, Granny. If told us new one, I should not keep thinking bread cupboard.--Come Johnny, sit me. Now then!" "I doubt there is one old-world cracks I have not told you," said old lady, "unless it is queer ghost story told years ago house hollow blocked-up windows." "Oh! ghosts!" Tommy broke in; "we have many. I know rattling, scratching, knocking, figure white; turns tombstone white petticoat, I hate it." "It nothing sort tombstone," said old lady dignity. "It is good half-mile churchyard. And white petticoats, was not female house; he would not one; his victuals came pantry window. But never mind! Though it is true sermon." Johnnie lifted his head his brother's knee. "Let Granny tell she likes, Tommy. It is new ghost, I like know he was, his victuals came window." "I do not like story victuals," sulked Tommy. "It makes think bread. O Granny dear! tell us fairy story. You never tell us Fairies, I know know." "Hush! hush!" said old lady. "There is Miss Surbiton's Love Letter, her Dreadful End." "I know Miss Surbiton, Granny. I think she goose. Why will not tell us Fairies?" "Hush! hush! dears. There is Clerk Corpse-candles." "I know Corpse-candles, Granny. Besides, make Johnnie dream he wakes keep company. _Why_ will not tell us Fairies?" "My dear, do not like it," said old lady. "O Granny dear, do not they? Do tell! I should not think bread bit, told us Fairies. I know nothing them." "He lived house long enough," said old lady. "But it is lucky name him." "Oh Granny, hungry miserable, matter?" "Well, that is true enough," she sighed. "Trouts' luck gone; went Brownie, I believe." "Was _he_, Granny?" "Yes, dear, he lived Trouts several generations." "What he like, Granny?" "Like little man, say, dear." "What he do?" "He came family up, swept hearth, lighted fire, set breakfast, tidied room, sorts house-work. But he never would seen, could catch him. But could hear laughing playing house sometimes." "What darling! Did give wages, Granny?" "No! dear. He love. They set pancheon clear water night, bowl bread milk, cream. He liked that, he dainty. Sometimes he left bit money water. Sometimes he weeded garden threshed corn. He saved endless trouble, men maids." "O Granny! he go?" "The maids caught sight one night, dear, his coat ragged, got new suit, linen shirt him, laid bread milk bowl. But Brownie saw things, he put on, dancing round kitchen, sang, 'What here? Hemten hamten! Here I never tread stampen,' danced door never came back again." "O Grandmother! But not? Did not he like new clothes?" "The Old Owl knows, dear; I do not." "Who is Old Owl, Granny?" "I do not exactly know, dear. It is mother used say asked anything puzzled her. It said Old Owl Nanny Besom, (a witch, dear!) took shape bird, could not change her voice, that is owl sits silent day fear she betray herself speaking, singing voice like birds. Many people used go consult Old Owl moon-rise, young days." "Did ever go, Granny?" "Once, nearly, dear." "Oh! tell us, Granny dear.--There Corpse-candles, Johnnie; it is moonlight," he added consolingly, Johnnie crept closer his knee pricked his little red ears. "It grandfather courting me, dears," said old lady, "and I could not quite make mind. So I went mother, said, 'He is one side, he is other, on. Shall I say yes no?' And mother said, 'The Old Owl knows;' she fairly puzzled. So says I, 'I will go ask her to-night, sure moon rises.' "So moon-rise I went, white light gate stood grandfather. 'What time night?' says I. 'Watching window,' says he. 'What _you_ time night?' 'The Old Owl knows,' said I, burst crying." "What for?" said Johnnie. "I cannot rightly tell you, dear," said old lady, "but gave turn see him. And without ado grandfather kissed me. 'How dare you?' said I. 'What mean?' 'The Old Owl knows,' said he. So never went." "How stupid!" said Tommy. "Tell us Brownie, please," said Johnnie. "Did he ever live anybody else?" "There plenty Brownies," said old lady, "or used mother's young days. Some houses several." "Oh! I wish would come back!" cried boys chorus. "He would-- "tidy room," said Johnnie; "fetch turf," said Tommy; "pick chips," said Johnnie; "sort scraps," said Tommy; "and everything. Oh! I wish he had not gone away." "What is that?" said Tailor coming moment. "It is Brownie, Father," said Tommy. "We sorry he went, wish one." "What nonsense telling them, Mother?" asked Tailor. "Heighty teighty," said old lady, bristling. "Nonsense, indeed! As good men you, Son Thomas, would soon jumped crags, spoken lightly _them_, mother's young days." "Well, well," said Tailor, "I beg pardon. They never aught me, whatever forbears; they are welcome old place ever, choose come. There is plenty do." "Would mind setting pan water, Father?" asked Tommy gently. "There is bread milk." "You may set like, lad," said Tailor; "and I wish bread milk sakes, Bairns. You it, I got it. But go bed now." They lugged pancheon, filled dexterity usual, went bed, leaving knife one corner, wood another, splashes water track. There room comfort ruined old farm-house, two boys slept bed cut heather, old malt loft. Johnnie soon land dreams, growing rosier rosier he slept, tumbled apple among gray heather. But lazy Tommy. The idea domesticated Brownie taken full possession his mind; whither Brownie gone, he might found, would induce return, mysteries he longed solve. "There is owl living old she would mere," he thought. "It may Old Owl herself, she knows, Granny says. When father's gone bed, moon rises. I will go." Meanwhile he lay down. * * * * * The moon rose like gold, went heavens like silver, flooding moors pale ghostly light, taking color heather, painting black shadows stone walls. Tommy opened his eyes, ran window. "The moon risen," said he, crept softly ladder, kitchen, pan water, Brownie, moor. The air fresh, say chilly; glorious night, though everything wind Tommy seemed asleep. The stones, walls, gleaming lanes, intensely still; church tower valley seemed awake watching, silent; houses village round eyes shut, is, window blinds down; seemed Tommy moors drawn white sheets them, lay sleeping also. "Hoot! hoot!" said voice fir plantation behind him. Somebody else awake, then. "It is Old Owl," said Tommy; she came, swinging heavily across moor flapping stately flight, sailed she would mere. The old lady moved faster she seemed do, though Tommy ran hard she she would time him. When he got in, bird seen, he heard crunching sound above, looking up, sat Old Owl, pecking tearing munching shapeless black object, blinking him--Tommy--with yellow eyes. "Oh dear!" said Tommy, he did not much like it. The Old Owl dropped black mass floor; Tommy care somehow examine it. "Come up! come up!" said she, hoarsely. She could speak, then! Beyond doubt _the_ Old Owl none other. Tommy shuddered. "Come here! come here!" said Old Owl. The Old Owl sat beam ran across she would. Tommy often climbed fun; he climbed now, sat face face her, thought her eyes looked made flame. "Kiss fluffy face," said Owl. Her eyes going round like flaming catherine wheels, certain requests one option refusing. Tommy crept nearer, put his lips round face eyes shone. Oh! downy warm, soft, indescribably soft. Tommy's lips sank it, could not get bottom. It unfathomable feathers fluffyness. "Now, want?" said Owl. "Please," said Tommy, felt rather re-assured, "can tell find Brownies, get one come live us?" "Oohoo!" said Owl, "that is it, it? I know three Brownies." "Hurrah!" said Tommy. "Where live?" "In house," said Owl. Tommy aghast. "In house!" he exclaimed. "Whereabouts? Let rummage out. Why nothing?" "One young," said Owl. "But do not others work?" asked Tommy. "They idle, idle," said Old Owl, she gave herself shake she said it, fluff went flying she would, Tommy nearly tumbled beam his fright. "Then do not want them," said he. "What use Brownies nothing help us?" "Perhaps do not know how, one told them," said Owl. "I wish would tell find them," said Tommy; "I could tell them." "Could you?" said Owl. "Oohoo! Oohoo!" Tommy could not tell whether she hooting laughing. "Of course I could," he said. "They might sweep house, light fire, spread table, sort thing, father came down. Besides, could _see_ wanted. The Brownies Granny's mother's young days. And could tidy room, fetch turf, pick chips, sort Granny's scraps. Oh! there is lots do." "So is," said Owl. "Oohoo! Well, I tell find one Brownies; find him, he tell his brother is. But depends upon whether feel equal undertaking it, whether follow directions." "I quite ready go," said Tommy, "and I shall tell me. I feel sure I could persuade them. If knew every one would love made useful!" "Oohoo! oohoo!" said Owl. "Now pay attention. You must go north side mere moon shining--('I know Brownies like water,' muttered Tommy)--and turn round three times, saying charm: 'Twist me, turn me, show Elf-- I looked water, saw--' When got far, look water, moment see Brownie, think word fill couplet, rhyme first line. If either see Brownie, fail think word, use." "Is Brownie merman," said Tommy, wriggling along beam, "that he lives water?" "That depends whether he fish's tail," said Owl, "and discover yourself." "Well, moon shining, I shall go," said Tommy. "Good-bye, thank you, Madam;" he jumped went, saying he ran, "I believe he merman same, else could he live mere? I know Brownies Granny does, I shall tell her so;" Tommy somewhat opinionated, like young people. The moon shone brightly centre mere. Tommy knew place well fine echo there. Round edge grew rushes water plants, cast border shadow. Tommy went north side, turning three times, Old Owl told him, he repeated charm-- "Twist turn me, show Elf-- I looked water, saw--" Now it! He looked in, saw--the reflection his face. "Why, there is one myself!" said Tommy. "And word be? I must done wrong." "Wrong!" said Echo. Tommy almost surprised find echo awake time night. "Hold tongue!" said he. "Matters provoking enough themselves. Belf! Celf! Delf! Felf! Gelf! Helf! Jelf! What rubbish! There cannot word fit it. And look Brownie, see nothing myself!" "Myself," said Echo. "Will quiet?" said Tommy. "If would tell one word would sense interference; roar 'Myself!' one, neither rhymes runs--it rhyme though, happens," he added; "and odd! runs too-- 'Twist me, turn me, show Elf; I looked water, saw myself,' I certainly did. What mean? The Old Owl knows, Granny would say; I shall go back ask her." "Ask her!" said Echo. "Did not I say I should?" said Tommy. "How exasperating are! It strange. _Myself_ certainly rhyme, I wonder I think long ago." "Go," said Echo. "Will mind business, go sleep?" said Tommy. "I going; I said I should." And back he went. There sat Old Owl before. "Oohoo!" said she, Tommy climbed up. "What see mere?" "I saw nothing myself," said Tommy indignantly. "And expect see?" asked Owl. "I expected see Brownie," said Tommy; "you told so." "And Brownies like, pray?" inquired Owl. "The one Granny knew useful little fellow, something like little man," said Tommy. "Ah!" said Owl, "but know present one idle little fellow, something like little man. Oohoo! oohoo! Are quite sure did not see him?" "Quite," answered Tommy sharply. "I saw one myself." "Hoot! toot! How touchy are! And you, pray?" "I Brownie," said Tommy. "Do not sure," said Owl. "Did find word?" "No," said Tommy. "I could find word meaning would rhyme 'myself.'" "Well, runs rhymes," said Owl. "What want? Where is brother now?" "In bed malt-loft," said Tommy. "Then questions answered," said Owl, "and know wants doing, go it. Good-night, rather good-morning, long past midnight;" old lady began shake her feathers start. "Do not go yet, please," said Tommy humbly. "I do not understand it. You know I am Brownie, I?" "Yes, are," said Owl, "and idle one too. All children Brownies." "But I could not work like Brownie," said Tommy. "Why not?" inquired Owl. "Could not sweep floor, light fire, spread table, tidy room, fetch turf, pick chips, sort grandmother's scraps? You know 'there is lots do.'" "But I do not think I like it," said Tommy. "I would much rather Brownie me." "And would meanwhile?" asked Owl. "Be idle, I suppose; suppose use man's children nothing help him? Ah! knew every one would love made useful!" "But really truly so?" asked Tommy, dismal voice. "Are Brownies children?" "No, not," said owl. "And pray think Brownies, whoever may be, come house save trouble idle healthy little boys live it? Listen me, Tommy," said old lady, her eyes shooting rays fire dark corner she sat. "Listen me, clever boy, understand one speaks; I tell whole history Brownies, handed family grandmother's great-grandmother, lived Druid's Oak, intimate fairies. And I done shall tell think are, children. It is opinion I come rate, I do not think wisdom died great-grandmothers." "I like hear please," said Tommy. The Old Owl shook tuft two fluff, set her eyes a-going, began: "The Brownies, sometimes called, Small Folk, Little People, Good People, race tiny beings domesticate house grown-up human pays rent taxes. They like small editions men women, small fragile heavy work; strength man, thousand times fresh nimble. They run jump, roll tumble, marvellous agility endurance, many aches pains men women groan under, even know names. They trade profession, live entirely upon people, know nothing domestic cares; fact, know little upon subject, though often intelligent highly inquisitive. They love dainties, play, mischief. They apt greatly beloved, capriciously affectionate. They little people, little things. When idle mischievous, called Boggarts, curse house live in. When useful considerate, Brownies, much-coveted blessing. Sometimes Blessed Brownies take abode worthy couple, cheer romps merry laughter, tidy house, find things lost, take little troubles hands full great anxieties. Then time Little People Brownies longer. They grow men women. They care much dainties, play, mischief. They cease jump tumble, roll house. They know more, laugh less. Then, heads begin ache anxiety, labor living, great cares life come on, Brownies come live them, take little cares, supply little comforts, make house merry more." "How nice!" said Tommy. "Very nice," said Old Owl. "But what"--and she shook herself fiercely ever, glared Tommy expected nothing less her eyes would set fire her feathers she would burnt alive. "But must I say Boggarts? Those idle urchins eat bread milk, do not work, lie bed without ache pain excuse them, untidy instead tidying, work instead it, leave little cares heap big cares, till old people support worn altogether." "Do not!" said Tommy. "I cannot bear it." "I hope Boggarts grow men," said Old Owl, "that children Boggarts too, they will know is!" "Do not!" roared Tommy. "I will not Boggart. I will Brownie." "That is right," nodded Old Owl. "I said boy could understand one spoke. And remember Brownies never seen work. They get household, get away one see them. I cannot tell why. I do not think grandmother's great-grandmother knew. Perhaps good deeds better done secret." "Please," said Tommy, "I like go home now, tell Johnnie. It is getting cold, I tired!" "Very true," said Old Owl, "and early to-morrow. I think I better take home." "I know way, thank you," said Tommy. "I did not say _shew_ way, I said _take_ you--carry you," said Owl. "Lean me." "I would rather not, thank you," said Tommy. "Lean me," screamed Owl. "Oohoo! obstinate boys sure!" Tommy crept up, unwillingly. "Lean full weight, shut eyes," said Owl. Tommy laid his head Old Owl's feathers, vague idea she smelt heather, thought must living moor, shut his eyes, leant his full weight, expecting he Owl would certainly fall beam together. Down--feathers--fluff--he sank sank, could feel nothing solid, jumped start save himself, opened his eyes, found he sitting among heather malt-loft, Johnnie sleeping his side. "How quickly came!" said he; "that certainly clever Old Owl. I could not counted ten whilst eyes shut. How odd!" But odder still was, longer moonlight early dawn. "Get up, Johnnie," said his brother, "I have got story tell you." And Johnnie sat up, rubbed his eyes open, he related his adventures moor. "Is true?" said Johnnie. "I mean, really happen?" "Of course did," said his brother; "do not believe it?" "Oh yes," said Johnnie. "But I thought perhaps true story, like Granny's true stories. I believe those, know. But there, know, different--" "I there," said Tommy, "and it is I tell you: I tell what, mean anything must get up: though, oh dear! I like stay bed. I say," he added, pause, "suppose do. It cannot matter Boggarts one night more. I mean Brownie I grow up, though. I could not stand boggarty children." "I will not Boggart all," said Johnnie, "It is horrid. But I do not see Brownies, I am afraid cannot things. I wish I bigger!" "I well enough," said Tommy, following his brother's example getting up. "Do not suppose I light fire? Think bonfires made! And I do not think I mind regular good tidy-up either. It is stupid putting-away-things-when-you have-done-with-them I hate so!" The Brownies crept softly ladder kitchen. There blank hearth, dirty floor, odds ends lying about, looking cheerless enough dim light, Tommy felt quite important he looked round. There cure untidiness clearing people; one sees clearly fault lies. "Look door-step, Johnnie," said Brownie-elect, "what mess made it! If lifted moss carefully, instead stamping struggling it, would saved us ten minutes' work morning." This wisdom could gainsaid, Johnnie looked meek rueful. "I going light fire," pursued his brother;--"the next turfs, know, _we_ must get--you tidy bit. Look knife I gave hold last night, wood--that is fault though, scraps Granny's chair. What grubbing rat-hole for?" Johnnie raised his head somewhat flushed tumbled. "What think I found?" said he triumphantly. "Father's measure lost week!" "Hurrah!" said Tommy, "put his things. That is sort thing Brownie done. What he say? And I say, Johnnie, you have tidied, go grub potato two garden, I will put roast breakfast. I am lighting bonfire!" The fire successful. Johnnie went potatoes, Tommy cleaned door-step, swept room, dusted chairs old chest, set table. There doubt he could handy he chose. "I will tell I thought of, time," said Johnnie, he washed potatoes water set Brownie. "We might run South Pasture mushrooms. Father said reason found people go sunrise take market. The sun's rising, sure find some, would breakfast." "There is plenty time," said Tommy; went. The dew lay heavy thick upon grass road side, miles network spiders woven blossom blossom heather. The dew Sun's breakfast; he barely yet, eaten it, world felt anything warm. Nevertheless, sweet fresh later hour day, every sound like returning voice long absent friend. Down pastures, network dew, one nothing speak way boots, state ground less consequence. The Tailor right, lack mushrooms time morning. All pasture stood, sizes, like buttons, like tables; distance one two ragged women, stooping baskets, looked like huge fungi also. "This fairies feast," said Tommy. "They large party last night. When go, take away dishes cups, made gold; leave tables, eat them." "I wonder whether giants would like eat tables," said Johnnie. This beyond Tommy's capabilities surmise; filled handkerchief, hurried back fear Tailor come down-stairs. They depositing last mushroom dish table, his footsteps heard descending. "There he is!" exclaimed Tommy. "Remember, musn't caught. Run back bed." Johnnie caught handkerchief, smothering laughter, two scrambled back ladder, dashed straight heather. Meanwhile poor Tailor came wearily down-stairs. Day day, since his wife's death, he come every morning desolate sight--yesterday's refuse empty hearth. This morning task tidying always sad ungrateful one widowed father. His awkward struggles house-work _she_ notable, chafed him. The dirty kitchen dreary, labor lonely, hour's time lost his trade. But life stand still one wishing, Tailor neither remedy substitute; came morning mornings pail broom. When he came he looked round, started, rubbed his eyes; looked round again, rubbed harder; went fire held his hand, (warm certainly)--then table smelt mushrooms, (esculent fungi beyond doubt)--handled loaf, stared open door window, swept floor, sunshine pouring in, finally sat stunned admiration. Then he jumped ran foot stairs, shouting,-- "Mother! Mother! Trout's luck come again." "And yet, no!" he thought, "the old lady's asleep, it is shame wake her, I will tell idle rascally lads, they will pleased deserve. It Tommy set water caught him." "Boys! boys!" he shouted foot ladder, "the Brownie come!--and he has not found measure!" he added returning kitchen, "this good day's work me." There great excitement small household day. The boys kept counsel. The old Grandmother triumphant, tried seem surprised. The Tailor made vain effort, remained till bed-time state fresh unconcealed amazement. "I have often heard Good People," he broke towards end evening. "And I have heard folk say they have known seen capering round gray rocks moor midnight: wonderful! To come work pan cold water! Who could believed it?" "You might believed you would believed me, Son Thomas," said old lady tossily. "I told so. But young people always know better elders!" "I did not see him," said Tailor, beginning his story afresh; "but I thought I came I heard sort laughing rustling." "My mother said often heard playing laughing house," said old lady. "I told so." "Well, he shall not want bowl bread milk to-morrow, anyhow," said Tailor, "if I stick Farmer Swede's waistcoat till midnight." But waistcoat finished bed-time, Tailor set bread milk himself, went rest. "I say," said Tommy, boys bed, "the Old Owl right, must stick it. But I will tell I do not like, is, father thinking we are idle still. I wish he knew Brownies." "So I," said Johnnie; he sighed. "I tell what," said Tommy, decisiveness elder brotherhood, "we will keep quiet bit fear leave off; we have gone good while, I shall tell him. It Old Owl's grandmother's great-grandmother said kept secret, Old Owl herself said grandmothers always right." "No are," said Johnnie; "look Granny this." "I know," said Tommy. "She is regular muddle." "So she is," said Johnnie. "But that is rather fun, I think." And went sleep. Day day went by, still Brownies "stuck it," work. It hard matter get early one young light-hearted, sleeps upon heather loft without window-blind, many broken window-panes air comes freely in. In old times boys used play tents among heather, Tailor house-work; came him. Size everything, even material existence. One heard dwarfs quite clever, (not say powerful,) giants, I fancy Fairy Godmothers ever large. It wonderful comfort Brownies may house fortunate enough hold them! The Tailor's Brownies joy his life; day day seemed grow ingenious finding little things his good. Now-a-days Granny never picked scrap herself. One day's shearings neatly arranged next morning, laid her knitting-pins; Tailor's tape shears absent without leave. One day message came offer two three days' tailoring farm-house miles valley. This pleasant advantageous sort work; good food, sure pay, cheerful change; he know he could leave his family, unless, indeed, Brownie might relied upon "keep house together," say. The boys sure he would, promised set his water, give little trouble possible; so, finally, Tailor took his shears went valley, green banks sloped purple moor, broke sandy rocks, crowned nodding oak fern. On prosperous old farm, he spent pleasant time, sitting level window geraniums table set apart him, stitching gossiping, gossiping stitching, feeling secure honest payment his work done. The mistress house kind good creature, loved chat; though Tailor kept his secret Brownies, he felt rather curious know Good People hand comfort flourishing household, watched his opportunity make careless inquiries subject. "Brownies?" laughed dame. "Ay, Master, I heard them. When I girl, service old hall, Cowberry Edge, I heard good deal one said lived former times. He house-work well woman, good deal quicker, said. One night one young ladies (that then, they are dead now,) hid herself cupboard, see he like." "And he like?" inquired Tailor, composedly he able. "A little fellow, said;" answered Farmer's wife, knitting calmly on. "Like dwarf, know, largish head his body. Not taller than--why, Bill, eldest boy, perhaps. And he dressed rags, old cloak on, stamping passion cobweb he could not get his broom. They have uncertain tempers, say. Tears one minute, laughing next." "You never one here, I suppose?" said Tailor. "Not we," she answered; "and I think I would rather not. They are canny all; master always used work, we have sons daughters help us, that is better meddling Fairies, mind. No! no!" she added, laughing, "If one you would heard it, whoever did not, I decent clothes made him. I could not stand rags old cloaks, messing moth-catching house." "They say it is lucky give clothes, though," said Tailor; "they do not like it." "Tell me!" said dame, "as one liked tidy room, would not like tidy clothes, could get them. No! no! one, shall take his measure, I promise you." And Tailor got her subject. When his work finished, Farmer paid once; good dame added half cheese, bottle-green coat. "That laid small master he is stout," she said; "but except stain two it is good enough, cut like new one lads." The Tailor thanked them, said farewell, went home. Down valley, river, wandering green banks sandy rocks, caught giant mosses, bands fairy fern, choked struggled, last barely escaped existence, ran away diminished stream. On purple hills old ruined house. As he came gate he struck idea change, looking again, he saw garden weeded, comparatively tidy. The truth is, Tommy Johnnie taken advantage Tailor's absence Brownie's work day-time. "It is Blessed Brownie!" said Tailor. "Has he usual?" he asked, he house. "To sure," said old lady; "all well, Son Thomas." "I will tell is," said Tailor, pause. "I am needy man, I hope I am ungrateful. I never repay Brownie he done mine; mistress yonder given bottle-green coat cut good new; sure there is Brownie house, I will make suit it." "You will _what?_" shrieked old lady. "Son Thomas, Son Thomas, you are mad! Do please Brownies, never make clothes." "There is nothing want more," said Tailor, "by accounts. They are rags, well may be, much work." "If make clothes Brownie, he will go good," said Grandmother, voice awful warning. "Well, I do not know," said her son. "The mistress farm clever enough, I tell you; she said me, fancy one likes tidy room, liking tidy coat!" For Tailor, like men, apt think well wisdom woman-kind houses. "Well, well," said old lady, "go way. I am old woman, time long. It does not matter much me. But new clothes drove Brownie before, Trout's luck went him." "I know, Mother," said Tailor, "and I have thinking way home; I tell was. Depend upon it, _the clothes did not fit_. But I will tell I mean do. I shall measure Tommy--they say Brownies his size--and ever I turned well-made coat waistcoat, shall his." "Please yourself," said old lady, she would say more. "I think you are quite right, Father," said Tommy, "and I can, I will help make them." Next day father son set work, Tommy contrived make useful, Tailor hardly knew he got much work. "It is like thing," he broke last, "to one bit helpful you; tailoring company's sake. I have done pleasant morning's work since poor mother died. I will tell is, Tommy," he added, "if always like this, I should not much care whether Brownie stayed went. I would give his help yours." "I will back directly," said Tommy, burst room search his brother. "I have come away," he said squatting down, "because I cannot bear it. I nearly let out, I shall soon. I wish things were not going come me," he added, kicking stone front him. "I wish he would measured you, Johnnie." "I am glad he did not," said Johnnie. "I wish he would kept himself." "Bottle-green, brass buttons," murmured Tommy, therewith fell reverie. The next night suit finished, laid bread milk. "We shall see," said old lady, withering tone. There much real prophetic wisdom truism, sounds awful, Tailor went bed somewhat depressed. Next morning Brownies came usual. "Do not look splendid?" said Tommy, feeling cloth. "When we have tidied place I shall put on." But long place tidy, he could wait longer, dressed up. "Look me!" he shouted; "bottle-green brass buttons! Oh, Johnnie, I wish some." "It is good thing two Brownies," said Johnnie, laughing, "and one rags still. I shall work morning." And he went flourishing round broom, Tommy jumped madly his new suit. "Hurrah!" he shouted, "I feel like Brownie. What Grannie said he sang he got his clothes? Oh, I know-- 'What here? Hemten hamten, Here I never tread stampen.'" And he danced, regardless clouds dust raised Johnnie, he drove broom indiscriminately floor, tune his laughter. It laughter roused Tailor morning, laughter coming floor kitchen below. He scrambled his things stole down-stairs. "It is Brownie," he thought; "I must look, it is last time." At door he paused listened. The laughter mixed singing, he heard words-- "What here? Hemten hamten, Here I never tread stampen." He pushed in, sight met his eyes: The kitchen primeval condition chaos, untidy particulars less apparent, everything less obscured clouds dust, Johnnie reigned triumphant, like witch her broomstick; and, crown all, Tommy capering singing Brownie's bottle-green suit, brass buttons all. "What is this?" shouted astonished Tailor, he could find breath speak. "It is Brownies," sang boys; danced, worked state excitement easy settle down. "Where _is_ Brownie?" shouted father. "He is here," said Tommy; "we Brownies." "Cannot stop fooling?" cried Tailor, angrily. "This past joke. Where real Brownie, I say?" "We Brownies, really, father," said Tommy, coming full stop, feeling strongly tempted run laughing crying. "Ask Old Owl. It is true, really." The Tailor saw boy earnest, passed his hand his forehead. "I suppose I am getting old," he said; "I cannot see daylight this. If Brownie, tidying kitchen lately?" "We have," said they. "But found measure?" "I did," said Johnnie. "And sorts grandmother's scraps?" "We do," said they. "And sets breakfast, puts things order?" "We do," said they. "But it?" asked Tailor. "Before come down," said they. "But I always call you," said Tailor. "We get back bed again," said boys. "But never before?" asked Tailor doubtfully. "We idle, idle," said Tommy. The Tailor's voice rose pitch desperation-- "But work," he shouted, "_Where Brownie?_" "Here!" cried boys, "and sorry Boggarts long." With father sons fell other's arms fairly wept. * * * * * It believed explain Grandmother work moment. She understood last, however, Tailor could restrain little good-humored triumph subject. Before he went work he settled her window her knitting, kissed her. "What think all, Mother?" he inquired. "Bairns blessing," said old lady tartly, "_I told so._" * * * * * "That is end, it?" asked one boys tone dismay, Doctor paused here. "Yes is," said he. "But could not make little end?" asked Deordie, "to tell us became all?" "I do not see tell," said Doctor. "Why, there is whether ever saw Old Owl again, whether Tommy Johnnie went Brownies," said children. The Doctor laughed. "Well, quiet five minutes," he said. "We will quiet mice," said children. And quiet mice were. Very like mice, indeed. Very like mice behind wainscot night, thrown something frighten away. Death-like stillness seconds, rustling scuffling please. So children sat holding breath moment two, shuffling feet smothered bursts laughter testified impatience, difficulty understanding process story-making displayed Doctor, sat pulling his beard, staring his boots, he made "a little end." "Well," he said, sitting suddenly, "the Brownies went work spite bottle-green suit, Trout's luck returned old house more. Before long Tommy began work farmers, Baby grew Brownie, made (as girls apt make) best house-sprite all. For, Brownie habits self-denial, thoughtfulness, consideration, art little kindnesses, boys are, I afraid, general rule, somewhat behindhand sisters. Whether altogether proceeds constitutional deficiency points masculine character, one result among many code by-laws obtains men's moral education cradle, question everybody opinion. For present young gentlemen may appropriate whichever theory prefer, go back story. The Tailor lived see his boy-Brownies become men, cares prosperous farm hands, his girl-Brownie carry her fairy talents another home. For Brownies--young ladies!--are much desired wives, whereas man might well marry old witch young Boggartess." "And Owl?" clamored children, rather resentful Doctor's pausing take breath. "Of course," he continued, "the Tailor heard whole story, anxious thank Old Owl her friendly offices, also rather curious see hear her, he went boys one night moon-rise she would mere. It earlier evening Tommy went, daylight vanished--and first appearance moon, impatient Tailor place. There found Owl, looking solemn stately beam. She sitting among shadows her shoulders up, she fixed her eyes steadily Tailor, he felt quite overpowered. He made her civil bow, however, said-- "I am much obliged you, Madam, good advice Tommy." The Owl blinked sharply, she grudged shutting her eyes instant, stared on, word spoke she. "I do not mean intrude, Madam," said Tailor; "but I wishful pay respects gratitude." Still Owl gazed determined silence. "Do not remember me?" said Tommy pitifully. "I everything told me. Will not even say good-bye?" he went towards her. The Owl's eyes contracted, she shuddered tufts fluff she would, shook her wings, shouting "Oohoo!" top her voice, flew upon moor. The Tailor his sons rushed watch her. They could see her clearly green twilight sky, flapping rapidly away her round face pale moon. "Good-bye!" shouted she disappeared; first departing owl, shadowy body flapping sails, two wings beating measured time, two moving lines still old tune, stroke, fancy, then--the green sky pale moon, Old Owl gone. "Did she never come back?" asked Tiny subdued tones, Doctor paused again. "No," said he; "at least she would mere. Tommy saw many owls course his life; none would speak, addicted unconventional customs staring winking, he could distinguish his friend, she among them. And I think all." "Is end?" asked Tiny. "The end," said Doctor. "I suppose might ends," speculated Deordie--"about whether Brownies children grew farmers, whether children Brownies, whether _they_ Brownies, on." And Deordie rocked among geraniums, luxurious imagining endless fairy tale. "You insatiable rascal!" said Doctor. "Not another word. Jump up, I am going see home. I early to-morrow." "Where?" said Deordie. "Never mind. I shall away day, I want home good time evening, I mean attack crop groundsel sweet-pea hedges. You know, Brownies come homestead!" And Doctor's mouth twitched little till he fixed stiff smile. The children tried hard extract ends way Rectory; he declined pursue history Trout family indefinite generations. It decided hands, however, Tommy Trout evidently one Tommy Trout pulled cat well, "it sort thing Brownie do, know!" Johnnie Green (who, course, Johnnie Trout,) unworthy village acquaintance, "a thorough Boggart." "Doctor!" said Tiny, stood garden-gate, "how long think gentlemen's pocket handkerchiefs take wear out?" "That, dear Madam," said Doctor, "must depend, like terrestrial matters, upon circumstances; whether gentleman bought fine cambric, coarse cotton pink portraits reigning Sovereign, commence with; whether he catches many colds, his pocket picked, takes snuff, allows his washerwoman use washing powders. But want know?" "I shall not tell that," said Tiny, spoilt Doctor, consequently tyrannized proportion; "but I tell I mean do. I mean tell Mother Father wants pocket handkerchiefs hemmed, she better put bath nursery, perhaps Brownie come them." "Kiss fluffy face!" said Doctor sepulchral tones. "The owl high up," said Tiny, tossing her head. The Doctor lifted her four feet so, obtained his kiss, set her again. "You are fluffy all," said she tone utmost contempt; "you are tickly bristly. Puss fluffy, Father scrubby scratchy, he shaves." "And three styles prefer?" said Doctor. "Not tickly bristly," said Tiny firmness; she strutted walk pace two, turned round laugh her shoulder. "Good-night!" shouted her victim, shaking his fist her. The children took noisy farewell, raced house, give joint versions fairy tale, first parents drawing-room, nurse nursery. The Doctor went home also, his poodle his heels, way he came. He went his way, odd; Doctor "a little odd," moreover always end his evening walk. Through churchyard, spreading cedars stiff yews rose velvet grass, among tombstones crosses various devices lay one older uglier date, he stayed. It framed border brilliant flowers, would seem Doctor must gardener, he picked dead ones, put absently his pocket. Then he looked round, see he alone. Not soul seen, moonlight shadow lay quietly side side, dead graves. The Doctor stooped took his hat. "Good-night, Marcia," he said, low quiet voice. "Good-night, darling!" The dog licked his hand, voice answer, regarded. Poor foolish Doctor! Most foolish speak departed his face earthwards. But weak mortals, best us; man (one best) raised his head last, went home like lonely owl his face moon sky. A BORROWED BROWNIE. "I cannot imagine," said Rector, walking drawing-room following afternoon, "I cannot imagine Tiny is. I want her drive end parish me." "There she comes," said his wife, looking window, "by garden-gate, great basket; she after?" The Rector went discover, met his daughter looking decidedly earthy, seemingly much exhausted weight basketful groundsel plants. "Where been?" said he. "In Doctor's garden," said Tiny triumphantly, "and look I done! I have weeded his sweet-peas, brought away groundsel; he gets home to-night he will think Brownie garden, Mrs. Pickles promised tell him." "But look here!" said Rector, affecting great appearance severity, "you are Brownie, his. Supposing Tommy Trout gone weeded Farmer Swede's garden, brought back his weeds go seed Tailor's flower-beds, think he would liked it?" Tiny looked rather crestfallen. When one fairly carried splendid benevolence kind, trying find oneself wrong. She crept Rector, however, put her golden head upon his arm. "But, Father dear," she pleaded, "I did not mean Brownie; only, know, got five left home, short time, Doctor has not Brownie all. Do not pity him?" And Rector, old enough remember grave-stone story wot of, hugged his Brownie his arms, answered-- "My Darling, I pity him!"
