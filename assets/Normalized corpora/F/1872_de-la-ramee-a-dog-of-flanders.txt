 A DOG OF FLANDERS Nello Patrasche left alone world. They friends friendship closer brotherhood. Nello little Ardennois--Patrasche big Fleming. They age length years, yet one still young, already old. They dwelt together almost days: orphaned destitute, owed lives hand. It beginning tie them, first bond sympathy; strengthened day day, grown growth, firm indissoluble, loved one another greatly. Their home little hut edge little village--a Flemish village league Antwerp, set amidst flat breadths pasture corn-lands, long lines poplars alders bending breeze edge great canal ran it. It score houses homesteads, shutters bright green sky-blue, roofs rose-red black white, walls white-washed shone sun like snow. In centre village stood windmill, placed little moss-grown slope: landmark level country round. It painted scarlet, sails all, infancy, half century earlier, ground wheat soldiers Napoleon; ruddy brown, tanned wind weather. It went queerly fits starts, though rheumatic stiff joints age, served whole neighborhood, would thought almost impious carry grain elsewhere attend religious service mass performed altar little old gray church, conical steeple, stood opposite it, whose single bell rang morning, noon, night strange, subdued, hollow sadness every bell hangs Low Countries seems gain integral part melody. Within sound little melancholy clock almost birth upward, dwelt together, Nello Patrasche, little hut edge village, cathedral spire Antwerp rising north-east, beyond great green plain seeding grass spreading corn stretched away like tideless, changeless sea. It hut old man, poor man--of old Jehan Daas, his time soldier, remembered wars trampled country oxen tread furrows, brought his service nothing except wound, made cripple. When old Jehan Daas reached his full eighty, his daughter died Ardennes, hard Stavelot, left legacy her two-year-old son. The old man could ill contrive support himself, he took additional burden uncomplainingly, soon became welcome precious him. Little Nello---which pet diminutive Nicolas--throve him, old man little child lived poor little hut contentedly. It humble little mud-hut indeed, clean white sea-she will, stood small plot garden-ground yielded beans herbs pumpkins. They poor, terribly poor--many day nothing eat. They never chance enough: enough eat would reached paradise once. But old man gentle good boy, boy beautiful, innocent, truthful, tender-hearted creature; happy crust leaves cabbage, asked earth heaven; save indeed Patrasche always them, since without Patrasche would been? For Patrasche alpha omega; treasury granary; store gold wand wealth; bread-winner minister; friend comforter. Patrasche dead gone them, must laid died likewise. Patrasche body, brains, hands, head, feet them: Patrasche life, soul. For Jehan Daas old cripple, Nello child; Patrasche dog. A dog Flanders--yellow hide, large head limb, wolf-like ears stood erect, legs bowed feet widened muscular development wrought his breed many generations hard service. Patrasche came race toiled hard cruelly sire son Flanders many century--slaves slaves, dogs people, beasts shafts harness, creatures lived straining sinews gall cart, died breaking hearts flints streets. Patrasche born parents labored hard days sharp-set stones various cities long, shadowless, weary roads two Flanders Brabant. He born heritage pain toil. He fed curses baptized blows. Why not? It Christian country, Patrasche dog. Before he fully grown he known bitter gall cart collar. Before he entered his thirteenth month he become property hardware-dealer, accustomed wander land north south, blue sea green mountains. They sold small price, he young. This man drunkard brute. The life Patrasche life hell. To deal tortures hell animal creation way Christians showing belief it. His purchaser sullen, ill-living, brutal Brabantois, heaped his cart full pots pans flagons buckets, wares crockery brass tin, left Patrasche draw load best he might, whilst he lounged idly side fat sluggish ease, smoking his black pipe stopping every wineshop café road. Happily Patrasche--or unhappily--he strong: he came iron race, long born bred cruel travail; he die, managed drag wretched existence brutal burdens, scarifying lashes, hunger, thirst, blows, curses, exhaustion wages Flemings repay patient laborious four-footed victims. One day, two years long deadly agony, Patrasche going usual along one straight, dusty, unlovely roads lead city Rubens. It full midsummer, warm. His cart heavy, piled high goods metal earthenware. His owner sauntered without noticing otherwise crack whip curled round his quivering loins. The Brabantois paused drink beer every wayside house, he forbidden Patrasche stop moment draught canal. Going along thus, full sun, scorching highway, eaten nothing twenty-four hours, and, far worse him, tasted water near twelve, blind dust, sore blows, stupefied merciless weight dragged upon his loins, Patrasche staggered foamed little mouth, fell. He fell middle white, dusty road, full glare sun; he sick unto death, motionless. His master gave medicine his pharmacy--kicks oaths blows cudgel oak, often food drink, wage reward, ever offered him. But Patrasche beyond reach torture curses. Patrasche lay, dead appearances, white powder summer dust. After while, finding useless assail his ribs punishment his ears maledictions, Brabantois--deeming life gone him, going nearly his carcass forever useless, unless indeed one strip skin gloves--cursed fiercely farewell, struck leathern bands harness, kicked his body aside grass, and, groaning muttering savage wrath, pushed cart lazily along road up-hill, left dying dog ants sting crows pick. It last day Kermesse away Louvain, Brabantois haste reach fair get good place his truck brass wares. He fierce wrath, Patrasche strong much-enduring animal, he hard task pushing his charette way Louvain. But stay look Patrasche never entered his thoughts: beast dying useless, he would steal, replace him, first large dog he found wandering alone sight master. Patrasche cost nothing, next nothing, two long, cruel years made toil ceaselessly his service sunrise sunset, summer winter, fair weather foul. He got fair use good profit Patrasche: human, he wise, left dog draw his last breath alone ditch, his bloodshot eyes plucked might birds, whilst he went his way beg steal, eat drink, dance sing, mirth Louvain. A dying dog, dog cart--why he waste hours agonies peril losing handful copper coins, peril shout laughter? Patrasche lay there, flung grass-green ditch. It busy road day, hundreds people, foot mules, wagons carts, went by, tramping quickly joyously Louvain. Some saw him, even look: passed on. A dead dog less--it nothing Brabant: would nothing anywhere world. After time, among holiday-makers, came little old man bent lame, feeble. He guise feasting: he poorly miserably clad, he dragged his silent way slowly dust among pleasure-seekers. He looked Patrasche, paused, wondered, turned aside, kneeled rank grass weeds ditch, surveyed dog kindly eyes pity. There little rosy, fair-haired, dark-eyed child years old, pattered amidst bushes, breast-high, stood gazing pretty seriousness upon poor, great, quiet beast. Thus two first met--the little Nello big Patrasche. The upshot day was, old Jehan Daas, much laborious effort, drew sufferer homeward his little hut, stone's throw amidst fields, tended much care sickness, brain seizure, brought heat thirst exhaustion, time shade rest passed away, health strength returned, Patrasche staggered upon his four stout, tawny legs. Now many weeks he useless, powerless, sore, near death; time he heard rough word, felt harsh touch, pitying murmurs child's voice soothing caress old man's hand. In his sickness grown care him, lonely man little happy child. He corner hut, heap dry grass his bed; learned listen eagerly his breathing dark night, tell he lived; he first well enough essay loud, hollow, broken bay, laughed aloud, almost wept together joy sign his sure restoration; little Nello, delighted glee, hung round his rugged neck chains marguerites, kissed fresh ruddy lips. So then, Patrasche arose, again, strong, big, gaunt, powerful, his great wistful eyes gentle astonishment curses rouse blows drive him; his heart awakened mighty love, never wavered fidelity whilst life abode him. But Patrasche, dog, grateful. Patrasche lay pondering long grave, tender, musing brown eyes, watching movements his friends. Now, old soldier, Jehan Daas, could nothing his living limp little small cart, he carried daily milk-cans happier neighbors owned cattle away town Antwerp. The villagers gave employment little charity--more suited well send milk town honest carrier, bide home look gardens, cows, poultry, little fields. But becoming hard work old man. He eighty-three, Antwerp good league off, more. Patrasche watched milk-cans come go one day he got well lying sun wreath marguerites round his tawny neck. The next morning, Patrasche, old man touched cart, arose walked placed betwixt handles, testified plainly dumb show could his desire his ability work return bread charity he eaten. Jehan Daas resisted long, old man one thought foul shame bind dogs labor Nature never formed them. But Patrasche would gainsaid: finding harness him, he tried draw cart onward his teeth. At length Jehan Daas gave way, vanquished persistence gratitude creature he succored. He fashioned his cart Patrasche could run it, he every morning his life thenceforward. When winter came, Jehan Daas thanked blessed fortune brought dying dog ditch fair-day Louvain; he old, he grew feebler year, he would ill known pull his load milk-cans snows deep ruts mud strength industry animal he befriended. As Patrasche, seemed heaven him. After frightful burdens his old master compelled strain under, call whip every step, seemed nothing amusement step little light green cart, bright brass cans, side gentle old man always paid tender caress kindly word. Besides, his work three four day, time he free he would--to stretch himself, sleep sun, wander fields, romp young child, play his fellow-dogs. Patrasche happy. Fortunately his peace, his former owner killed drunken brawl Kermesse Mechlin, sought disturbed his new well-loved home. A years later, old Jehan Daas, always cripple, became paralyzed rheumatism impossible go cart more. Then little Nello, grown his sixth year age, knowing town well accompanied his grandfather many times, took his place beside cart, sold milk received coins exchange, brought back respective owners pretty grace seriousness charmed beheld him. The little Ardennois beautiful child, dark, grave, tender eyes, lovely bloom upon his face, fair locks clustered his throat; many artist sketched group went him--the green cart brass flagons Teniers Mieris Van Tal, great tawny-colored, massive dog, his belled harness chimed cheerily he went, small figure ran beside little white feet great wooden shoes, soft, grave, innocent, happy face like little fair children Rubens. Nello Patrasche work well joyfully together Jehan Daas himself, summer came he better again, need stir out, could sit doorway sun see go forth garden wicket, doze dream pray little, awake clock tolled three watch return. And return Patrasche would shake free his harness bay glee, Nello would recount pride doings day; would go together meal rye bread milk soup, would see shadows lengthen great plain, see twilight veil fair cathedral spire; lie together sleep peacefully old man said prayer. So days years went on, lives Nello Patrasche happy, innocent, healthful. In spring summer especially glad. Flanders lovely land, around burgh Rubens perhaps least lovely all. Corn colza, pasture plough, succeed characterless plain wearying repetition, save gaunt gray tower, peal pathetic bells, figure coming athwart fields, made picturesque gleaner's bundle woodman's fagot, change, variety, beauty anywhere; he dwelt upon mountains amidst forests feels oppressed imprisonment tedium endlessness vast dreary level. But green fertile, wide horizons certain charm even dulness monotony; among rushes water-side flowers grow, trees rise tall fresh barges glide great hulks black sun, little green barrels vari-colored flags gay leaves. Anyway, greenery breadth space enough good beauty child dog; two asked better, work done, lie buried lush grasses side canal, watch cumbrous vessels drifting bring crisp salt smell sea among blossoming scents country summer. True, winter harder, rise darkness bitter cold, seldom much could eaten day, hut scarce better she would nights cold, although looked pretty warm weather, buried great kindly clambering vine, never bore fruit, indeed, covered luxuriant green tracery months blossom harvest. In winter winds found many holes walls poor little hut, vine black leafless, bare lands looked bleak drear without, sometimes within floor flooded frozen. In winter hard, snow numbed little white limbs Nello, icicles cut brave, untiring feet Patrasche. But even never heard lament, either them. The child's wooden shoes dog's four legs would trot manfully together frozen fields chime bells harness; sometimes, streets Antwerp, housewife would bring bowl soup handful bread, kindly trader would throw billets fuel little cart went homeward, woman village would bid keep share milk carried food; would run white lands, early darkness, bright happy, burst shout joy home. So, whole, well them, well; Patrasche, meeting highway public streets many dogs toiled daybreak nightfall, paid blows curses, loosened shafts kick starve freeze best might--Patrasche his heart grateful his fate, thought fairest kindliest world could hold. Though he often hungry indeed he lay night; though he work heats summer noons rasping chills winter dawns; though his feet often tender wounds sharp edges jagged pavement; though he perform tasks beyond his strength his nature--yet he grateful content: he his duty day, eyes he loved smiled him. It sufficient Patrasche. There one thing caused Patrasche uneasiness his life, this. Antwerp, world knows, full every turn old piles stones, dark ancient majestic, standing crooked courts, jammed gateways taverns, rising water's edge, bells ringing air, ever arched doors swell music pealing. There remain, grand old sanctuaries past, shut amidst squalor, hurry, crowds, unloveliness, commerce modern world, day long clouds drift birds circle winds sigh around them, beneath earth feet sleeps--RUBENS. And greatness mighty Master still rests upon Antwerp, wherever turn narrow streets his glory lies therein, mean things thereby transfigured; pace slowly winding ways, edge stagnant water, noisome courts, his spirit abides us, heroic beauty his visions us, stones felt his footsteps bore his shadow seem arise speak living voices. For city tomb Rubens still lives us him, alone. It quiet great white sepulchre--so quiet, save organ peals choir cries aloud Salve Regina Kyrie Eleison. Sure artist ever greater gravestone pure marble sanctuary gives heart his birthplace chancel St. Jacques. Without Rubens, Antwerp? A dirty, dusky, bustling mart, man would ever care look upon save traders business wharves. With Rubens, whole world men sacred name, sacred soil, Bethlehem god Art saw light, Golgotha god Art lies dead. O nations! closely treasure great men, alone future know you. Flanders her generations wise. In his life she glorified greatest her sons, his death she magnifies his name. But her wisdom rare. Now, trouble Patrasche this. Into great, sad piles stones, reared melancholy majesty crowded roofs, child Nello would many many time enter, disappear dark arched portals, whilst Patrasche, left without upon pavement, would wearily vainly ponder could charm thus allured his inseparable beloved companion. Once twice he essay see himself, clattering steps his milk-cart behind him; thereon he always sent back summarily tall custodian black clothes silver chains office; fearful bringing his little master trouble, he desisted, remained couched patiently churches time boy reappeared. It fact his going disturbed Patrasche: he knew people went church: village went small, tumbledown, gray pile opposite red windmill. What troubled little Nello always looked strangely he came out, always flushed pale; whenever he returned home visitations would sit silent dreaming, caring play, gazing evening skies beyond line canal, subdued almost sad. What it? wondered Patrasche. He thought could good natural little lad grave, his dumb fashion he tried he could keep Nello sunny fields busy market-place. But churches Nello would go: often would he go great cathedral; Patrasche, left without stones iron fragments Quentin Matsys's gate, would stretch yawn sigh, even howl then, vain, doors closed child perforce came forth again, winding his arms dog's neck would kiss his broad, tawney-colored forehead, murmur always words: "If I could see them, Patrasche!--if I could see them!" What they? pondered Patrasche, looking large, wistful, sympathetic eyes. One day, custodian way doors left ajar, he got moment his little friend saw. "They" two great covered pictures either side choir. Nello kneeling, rapt ecstasy, altar-picture Assumption, he noticed Patrasche, rose drew dog gently air, his face wet tears, he looked veiled places he passed them, murmured his companion, "It terrible see them, Patrasche, one poor cannot pay! He never meant poor see he painted them, I sure. He would us see day, every day: I sure. And keep shrouded there--shrouded dark, beautiful things!--and never feel light, eyes look them, unless rich people come pay. If I could see them, I would content die." But he could see them, Patrasche could help him, gain silver piece church exacts price looking glories Elevation Cross Descent Cross thing utterly beyond powers either would scale heights cathedral spire. They never much sou spare: cleared enough get little wood stove, little broth pot, utmost could do. And yet heart child set sore endless longing upon beholding greatness two veiled Rubens. The whole soul little Ardennois thrilled stirred absorbing passion Art. Going his ways old city early days sun people risen, Nello, looked little peasant-boy, great dog drawing milk sell door door, heaven dreams whereof Rubens god. Nello, cold hungry, stockingless feet wooden shoes, winter winds blowing among his curls lifting his poor thin garments, rapture meditation, wherein he saw beautiful fair face Mary Assumption, waves her golden hair lying upon her shoulders, light eternal sun shining upon her brow. Nello, reared poverty, buffeted fortune, untaught letters, unheeded men, compensation curse called Genius. No one knew it. He little any. No one knew it. Only indeed Patrasche, who, always, saw draw chalk upon stones every thing grew breathed, heard his little bed hay murmur manner timid, pathetic prayers spirit great Master; watched his gaze darken his face radiate evening glow sunset rosy rising dawn; felt many many time tears strange, nameless pain joy, mingled together, fall hotly bright young eyes upon his wrinkled yellow forehead. "I go grave quite content I thought, Nello, thou growest man thou couldst hut little plot ground, labor thyself, called Baas thy neighbors," said old man Jehan many hour his bed. For bit soil, called Baas--master--by hamlet round, achieved highest ideal Flemish peasant; old soldier, wandered earth his youth, brought nothing back, deemed his old age live die one spot contented humility fairest fate he could desire his darling. But Nello said nothing. The leaven working times begat Rubens Jordaens Van Eycks, wondrous tribe, times recent begat green country Ardennes, Meuse washes old walls Dijon, great artist Patroclus, whose genius near us us aright measure divinity. Nello dreamed things future tilling little rood earth, living wattle roof, called Baas neighbors little poorer little less poor himself. The cathedral spire, rose beyond fields ruddy evening skies dim, gray, misty mornings, said things this. But he told Patrasche, whispering, childlike, his fancies dog's ear went together work fogs daybreak, lay together rest among rustling rushes water's side. For dreams easily shaped speech awake slow sympathies human auditors; would sorely perplexed troubled poor old man bedridden his corner, who, his part, whenever he trodden streets Antwerp, thought daub blue red called Madonna, walls wine-shop he drank his sou's worth black beer, quite good famous altar-pieces stranger folk travelled far wide Flanders every land good sun shone. There one beside Patrasche Nello could talk his daring fantasies. This little Alois, lived old red mill grassy mound, whose father, miller, best-to-do husbandman village. Little Alois pretty baby soft round, rosy features, made lovely sweet dark eyes Spanish rule left many Flemish face, testimony Alvan dominion, Spanish art left broadsown throughout country majestic palaces stately courts, gilded house-fronts sculptured lintels--histories blazonry poems stone. Little Alois often Nello Patrasche. They played fields, ran snow, gathered daisies bilberries, went old gray church together, often sat together broad wood-fire mill-house. Little Alois, indeed, richest child hamlet. She neither brother sister; her blue serge dress never hole it; Kermesse she many gilded nuts Agni Dei sugar her hands could hold; she went her first communion her flaxen curls covered cap richest Mechlin lace, her mother's her grandmother's came her. Men spoke already, though she twelve years, good wife she would sons woo win; she herself little gay, simple child, nowise conscious her heritage, she loved playfellows well Jehan Daas's grandson his dog. One day her father, Baas Cogez, good man, somewhat stern, came pretty group long meadow behind mill, aftermath day cut. It his little daughter sitting amidst hay, great tawny head Patrasche her lap, many wreaths poppies blue corn-flowers round both: clean smooth slab pine wood boy Nello drew likeness stick charcoal. The miller stood looked portrait tears his eyes, strangely like, he loved his child closely well. Then he roughly chid little girl idling whilst her mother needed her within, sent her indoors crying afraid: then, turning, he snatched wood Nello's hands. "Dost much folly?" he asked, tremble his voice. Nello colored hung his head. "I draw everything I see," he murmured. The miller silent: he stretched his hand franc it. "It folly, I say, evil waste time: nevertheless, like Alois, please house-mother. Take silver bit leave me." The color died face young Ardennois; he lifted his head put his hands behind his back. "Keep money portrait both, Baas Cogez," he said, simply. "You often good me." Then he called Patrasche him, walked away across field. "I could seen franc," he murmured Patrasche, "but I could sell her picture--not even them." Baas Cogez went his mill-house sore troubled his mind. "That lad must much Alois," he said his wife night. "Trouble may come hereafter: he fifteen now, she twelve; boy comely face form." "And he good lad loyal," said housewife, feasting her eyes piece pine wood throned chimney cuckoo clock oak Calvary wax. "Yea, I gainsay that," said miller, draining his pewter flagon. "Then, think ever come pass," said wife, hesitatingly, "would matter much? She enough both, one cannot better happy." "You woman, therefore fool," said miller, harshly, striking his pipe table. "The lad naught beggar, and, painter's fancies, worse beggar. Have care together future, I send child surer keeping nuns Sacred Heart." The poor mother terrified, promised humbly his will. Not she could bring herself altogether separate child her favorite playmate, miller even desire extreme cruelty young lad guilty nothing except poverty. But many ways little Alois kept away her chosen companion; Nello, boy proud quiet sensitive, quickly wounded, ceased turn his steps Patrasche, he used every moment leisure, old red mill upon slope. What his offence he know: he supposed he manner angered Baas Cogez taking portrait Alois meadow; child loved would run nestle her hand his, he would smile her sadly say tender concern her himself, "Nay, Alois, anger father. He thinks I make idle, dear, he pleased me. He good man loves well: anger him, Alois." But sad heart he said it, earth look bright used he went sunrise poplars straight roads Patrasche. The old red mill landmark him, he used pause it, going coming, cheery greeting people her little flaxen head rose low mill-wicket, her little rosy hands held bone crust Patrasche. Now dog looked wistfully closed door, boy went without pausing, pang his heart, child sat within tears dropping slowly knitting she set her little stool stove; Baas Cogez, working among his sacks his mill-gear, would harden his say himself, "It best so. The lad beggar, full idle, dreaming fooleries. Who knows mischief might come future?" So he wise his generation, would door unbarred, except upon rare formal occasion, seemed neither warmth mirth two children, accustomed long daily gleeful, careless, happy interchange greeting, speech, pastime, watcher sports auditor fancies Patrasche, sagely shaking brazen bells his collar responding dog's swift sympathies every change mood. All little panel pine wood remained chimney mill-kitchen cuckoo clock waxen Calvary, sometimes seemed Nello little hard whilst his gift accepted he denied. But he complain: his habit quiet: old Jehan Daas said ever him, "We poor: must take God sends--the ill good: poor cannot choose." To boy always listened silence, reverent his old grandfather; nevertheless certain vague, sweet hope, beguiles children genius, whispered his heart, "Yet poor choose sometimes--choose great, men cannot say nay." And he thought still his innocence; one day, little Alois, finding chance alone among cornfields canal, ran held close, sobbed piteously morrow would her saint's day, first time her life her parents failed bid little supper romp great barns her feast-day always celebrated, Nello kissed her murmured her firm faith, "It shall different one day, Alois. One day little bit pine wood father mine shall worth weight silver; he shut door then. Only love always, dear little Alois, love always, I great." "And I love you?" pretty child asked, pouting little her tears, moved instinctive coquetries her sex. Nello's eyes left her face wandered distance, red gold Flemish night cathedral spire rose. There smile his face sweet yet sad little Alois awed it. "I great still," he said his breath--"great still, die, Alois." "You love me," said little spoilt child, pushing away; boy shook his head smiled, went his way tall yellow corn, seeing vision day fair future he come old familiar land ask Alois her people, refused denied, received honor, whilst village folk throng look upon say one another's ears, "Dost see him? He king among men, he great artist world speaks his name; yet he poor little Nello, beggar one may say, got his bread help his dog." And he thought he would fold his grandsire furs purples, portray old man portrayed Family chapel St. Jacques; he would hang throat Patrasche collar gold, place his right hand, say people, "This friend;" he would build great white marble palace, make luxuriant gardens pleasure, slope looking outward cathedral spire rose, dwell himself, summon it, home, men young poor friendless, mighty things; he would say always, sought bless his name, "Nay, thank me--thank Rubens. Without him, I been?" And dreams, beautiful, impossible, innocent, free selfishness, full heroical worship, closely he went he happy--happy even sad anniversary Alois's saint's day, he Patrasche went home little dark hut meal black bread, whilst mill-house children village sang laughed, ate big round cakes Dijon almond gingerbread Brabant, danced great barn light stars music flute fiddle. "Never mind, Patrasche," he said, his arms round dog's neck sat door hut, sounds mirth mill came night air--"never mind. It shall changed by." He believed future: Patrasche, experience philosophy, thought loss mill supper present ill compensated dreams milk honey vague hereafter. And Patrasche growled whenever he passed Baas Cogez. "This Alois's name-day, not?" said old man Daas night corner he stretched upon his bed sacking. The boy gave gesture assent: he wished old man's memory erred little, instead keeping sure account. "And there?" his grandfather pursued. "Thou hast never missed year before, Nello." "Thou art sick leave," murmured lad, bending his handsome head bed. "Tut! tut! Mother Nulette would come sat me, she scores times. What because, Nello?" old man persisted. "Thou surely hast ill words little one?" "Nay, grandfather--never," said boy quickly, hot color his bent face. "Simply truly, Baas Cogez asked year. He taken whim me." "But thou hast done nothing wrong?" "That I know--nothing. I took portrait Alois piece pine: all." "Ah!" The old man silent: truth suggested boy's innocent answer. He tied bed dried leaves corner wattle hut, he wholly forgotten ways world like. He drew Nello's fair head fondly his breast tenderer gesture. "Thou art poor, child," he said quiver his aged, trembling voice--"so poor! It hard thee." "Nay, I rich," murmured Nello; his innocence he thought so--rich imperishable powers mightier might kings. And he went stood door hut quiet autumn night, watched stars troop tall poplars bend shiver wind. All casements mill-house lighted, every notes flute came him. The tears fell his cheeks, he child, yet he smiled, he said himself, "In future!" He stayed quite still dark, he Patrasche went within slept together, long deeply, side side. Now he secret Patrasche knew. There little out-house hut, one entered himself--a dreary place, abundant clear light north. Here he fashioned rudely easel rough lumber, great gray sea stretched paper he given shape one innumerable fancies possessed his brain. No one ever taught anything; colors he means buy; he gone without bread many time procure even rude vehicles he here; black white he could fashion things he saw. This great figure he drawn chalk old man sitting fallen tree--only that. He seen old Michel woodman sitting evening many time. He never soul tell outline perspective, anatomy shadow, yet he given weary, worn-out age, sad, quiet patience, rugged, careworn pathos his original, given old lonely figure poem, sitting there, meditative alone, dead tree, darkness descending night behind him. It rude, course, way, many faults, doubt; yet real, true nature, true art, mournful, manner beautiful. Patrasche lain quiet countless hours watching gradual creation labor day done, he knew Nello hope--vain wild perhaps, strongly cherished--of sending great drawing compete prize two hundred francs year announced Antwerp would open every lad talent, scholar peasant, eighteen, would attempt win unaided work chalk pencil. Three foremost artists town Rubens judges elect victor according his merits. All spring summer autumn Nello work upon treasure, which, triumphant, would build his first step toward independence mysteries art he blindly, ignorantly, yet passionately adored. He said nothing one: his grandfather would understood, little Alois lost him. Only Patrasche he told all, whispered, "Rubens would give me, I think, he knew." Patrasche thought too, he knew Rubens loved dogs he never painted exquisite fidelity; men loved dogs were, Patrasche knew, always pitiful. The drawings go first day December, decision given twenty-fourth, he win might rejoice his people Christmas season. In twilight bitter wintry day, beating heart, quick hope, faint fear, Nello placed great picture his little green milk-cart, took it, help Patrasche, town, left it, enjoined, doors public building. "Perhaps worth nothing all. How I tell?" he thought, heart-sickness great timidity. Now he left there, seemed hazardous, vain, foolish, dream he, little lad bare feet, barely knew his letters, could anything great painters, real artists, could ever deign look. Yet he took heart he went cathedral: lordly form Rubens seemed rise fog darkness, loom magnificence him, whilst lips, kindly smile, seemed murmur, "Nay, courage! It weak heart faint fears I wrote name time upon Antwerp." Nello ran home cold night, comforted. He done his best: rest must God willed, he thought, innocent, unquestioning faith taught little gray chapel among willows poplar-trees. The winter sharp already. That night, reached hut, snow fell; fell many days that, paths divisions fields obliterated, smaller streams frozen over, cold intense upon plains. Then, indeed, became hard work go round milk world dark, carry darkness silent town. Hard work, especially Patrasche, passage years, bringing Nello stronger youth, bringing old age, his joints stiff his bones ached often. But he would never give his share labor. Nello would fain spared drawn cart himself, Patrasche would allow it. All he would ever permit accept help thrust behind truck lumbered along ice-ruts. Patrasche lived harness, he proud it. He suffered great deal sometimes frost, terrible roads, rheumatic pains his limbs, he drew his breath hard bent his stout neck, trod onward steady patience. "Rest thee home, Patrasche--it time thou didst rest--and I quite well push cart myself," urged Nello many morning; Patrasche, understood aright, would consented stay home veteran soldier shirk charge sounding; every day he would rise place his shafts, plod along snow fields his four round feet left print upon many, many years. "One must never rest till one dies," thought Patrasche; sometimes seemed time rest far off. His sight less clear been, gave pain rise night's sleep, though he would never lie moment his straw bell chapel tolling five let know daybreak labor begun. "My poor Patrasche, shall soon lie quiet together, I," said old Jehan Daas, stretching stroke head Patrasche old withered hand always shared one poor crust bread; hearts old man old dog ached together one thought: When gone, would care darling? One afternoon, came back Antwerp snow, become hard smooth marble Flemish plains, found dropped road pretty little puppet, tambourine--player, scarlet gold, six inches high, and, unlike greater personages Fortune let us drop, quite unspoiled unhurt fall. It pretty toy. Nello tried find owner, and, failing, thought thing please Alois. It quite night he passed mill-house: he knew little window her room. It could harm, he thought, he gave her his little piece treasure-trove, playfellows long. There she would sloping roof beneath her casement: he climbed tapped softly lattice: little light within. The child opened looked half frightened. Nello put tambourine-player her hands. "Here doll I found snow, Alois. Take it," he whispered--"take it, God bless thee, dear!" He slid she would-roof she time thank him, ran darkness. That night fire mill. Outbuildings much corn destroyed, although mill dwelling-house unharmed. All village terror, engines came tearing snow Antwerp. The miller insured, would lose nothing: nevertheless, he furious wrath, declared aloud fire due accident, foul intent. Nello, awakened his sleep, ran help rest: Baas Cogez thrust angrily aside. "Thou wert loitering dark," he said roughly. "I believe, soul, thou dost know fire one." Nello heard silence, stupefied, supposing one could say things except jest, comprehending one could pass jest time. Nevertheless, miller said brutal thing openly many his neighbors day followed; though serious charge ever preferred lad, got bruited Nello seen mill-yard dark unspoken errand, he bore Baas Cogez grudge forbidding his intercourse little Alois; hamlet, followed sayings richest landowner servilely, whose families hoped secure riches Alois future time sons, took hint give grave looks cold words old Jehan Daas's grandson. No one said anything openly, village agreed together humor miller's prejudice, cottages farms Nello Patrasche called every morning milk Antwerp, downcast glances brief phrases replaced broad smiles cheerful greetings always used. No one really credited miller's absurd suspicion, outrageous accusations born them, people poor ignorant, one rich man place pronounced him. Nello, his innocence his friendlessness, strength stem popular tide. "Thou art cruel lad," miller's wife dared say, weeping, her lord. "Sure he innocent lad faithful, would never dream wickedness, however sore his heart might be." But Baas Cogez obstinate man, said thing held doggedly, though his innermost soul he knew well injustice he committing. Meanwhile, Nello endured injury done certain proud patience disdained complain: he gave way little he quite alone old Patrasche. Besides, he thought, "If win! They sorry then, perhaps." Still, boy quite sixteen, dwelt one little world his short life, his childhood caressed applauded sides, hard trial whole little world turn naught. Especially hard bleak, snow-bound, famine-stricken winter-time, light warmth could found abode beside village hearths kindly greetings neighbors. In winter-time drew nearer other, all, except Nello Patrasche, none would anything do, left fare might old paralyzed, bedridden man little cabin, whose fire often low, whose board often without bread, buyer Antwerp taken drive his mule day milk various dairies, three four people refused his terms purchase remained faithful little green cart. So burden Patrasche drew become light, centime-pieces Nello's pouch become, alas! small likewise. The dog would stop, usual, familiar gates, closed him, look wistful, mute appeal; cost neighbors pang shut doors hearts, let Patrasche draw his cart again, empty. Nevertheless, it, desired please Baas Cogez. Noël close hand. The weather wild cold. The snow six feet deep, ice firm enough bear oxen men upon everywhere. At season little village always gay cheerful. At poorest dwelling possets cakes, joking dancing, sugared saints gilded Jésus. The merry Flemish bells jingled everywhere horses; everywhere within doors well-filled soup-pot sang smoked stove; everywhere snow without laughing maidens pattered bright kerchiefs stout kirtles, going mass. Only little hut dark cold. Nello Patrasche left utterly alone, one night week Christmas Day, Death entered there, took away life forever old Jehan Daas, never known life aught save poverty pains. He long half dead, incapable movement except feeble gesture, powerless anything beyond gentle word; yet his loss fell great horror it: mourned passionately. He passed away his sleep, gray dawn learned bereavement, unutterable solitude desolation seemed close around them. He long poor, feeble, paralyzed old man, could raise hand defence, he loved well: his smile always welcomed return. They mourned unceasingly, refusing comforted, white winter day followed deal she will held his body nameless grave little gray church. They his mourners, two he left friendless upon earth--the young boy old dog. "Surely, he relent let poor lad come hither?" thought miller's wife, glancing her husband smoking hearth. Baas Cogez knew her thought, he hardened his heart, would unbar his door little, humble funeral went by. "The boy beggar," he said himself: "he shall Alois." The woman dared say anything aloud, grave closed mourners gone, she put wreath immortelles Alois's hands bade her go lay reverently dark, unmarked mound snow displaced. Nello Patrasche went home broken hearts. But even poor, melancholy, cheerless home denied consolation. There month's rent over-due little home, Nello paid last sad service dead he coin left. He went begged grace owner hut, cobbler went every Sunday night drink his pint wine smoke Baas Cogez. The cobbler would grant mercy. He harsh, miserly man, loved money. He claimed default his rent every stick stone, every pot pan, hut, bade Nello Patrasche morrow. Now, cabin lowly enough, sense miserable enough, yet hearts clove great affection. They happy there, summer, clambering vine flowering beans, pretty bright midst sunlighted fields! There life full labor privation, yet well content, gay heart, running together meet old man's never-failing smile welcome! All night long boy dog sat fireless hearth darkness, drawn close together warmth sorrow. Their bodies insensible cold, hearts seemed frozen them. When morning broke white, chill earth morning Christmas Eve. With shudder, Nello clasped close his friend, his tears fell hot fast dog's frank forehead. "Let us go, Patrasche--dear, dear Patrasche," he murmured. "We wait kicked out: let us go." Patrasche his, went sadly, side side, little place dear both, every humble, homely thing precious beloved. Patrasche drooped his head wearily he passed his green cart: longer his--it go rest pay rent, his brass harness lay idle glittering snow. The dog could lain beside died heart-sickness he went, whilst lad lived needed Patrasche would yield give way. They took old accustomed road Antwerp. The day yet scarce dawned, shutters still closed, villagers about. They took notice whilst dog boy passed them. At one door Nello paused looked wistfully within: his grandfather done many kindly turn neighbor's service people dwelt there. "Would give Patrasche crust?" he said, timidly. "He old, he nothing since last forenoon." The woman shut door hastily, murmuring vague saying wheat rye dear season. The boy dog went wearily: asked more. By slow painful ways reached Antwerp chimes tolled ten. "If I anything I could sell get bread!" thought Nello, he nothing except wisp linen serge covered him, his pair wooden shoes. Patrasche understood, nestled his nose lad's hand, though pray disquieted woe want his. The winner drawing-prize proclaimed noon, public building he left his treasure Nello made his way. On steps entrance-hall crowd youths--some his age, older, parents relatives friends. His heart sick fear he went among them, holding Patrasche close him. The great bells city clashed hour noon brazen clamor. The doors inner hall opened; eager, panting throng rushed in: known selected picture would raised rest upon wooden dais.. A mist obscured Nello's sight, his head swam, his limbs almost failed him. When his vision cleared he saw drawing raised high: his own! A slow, sonorous voice proclaiming aloud victory adjudged Stephen Kiesslinger, born burgh Antwerp, son wharfinger town. When Nello recovered his consciousness he lying stones without, Patrasche trying every art he knew call back life. In distance throng youths Antwerp shouting around successful comrade, escorting acclamations his home upon quay. The boy staggered his feet drew dog his embrace. "It over, dear Patrasche," he murmured--"all over!" He rallied best he could, he weak fasting, retraced his steps village. Patrasche paced his side his head drooping his old limbs feeble hunger sorrow. The snow falling fast: keen hurricane blew north: bitter death plains. It took long traverse familiar path, bells sounding four clock approached hamlet. Suddenly Patrasche paused, arrested scent snow, scratched, whined, drew his teeth small case brown leather. He held Nello darkness. Where stood little Calvary, lamp burned dully cross: boy mechanically turned case light: name Baas Cogez, within notes two thousand francs. The sight roused lad little his stupor. He thrust his shirt, stroked Patrasche drew onward. The dog looked wistfully his face. Nello made straight mill-house, went house-door struck panels. The miller's wife opened weeping, little Alois clinging close her skirts. "Is thee, thou poor lad?" she said kindly her tears. "Get thee gone ere Baas see thee. We sore trouble to-night. He seeking power money he let fall riding homeward, snow he never find it; God knows go nigh ruin us. It Heaven's judgment things done thee." Nello put note-case her hand called Patrasche within house. "Patrasche found money to-night," he said quickly. "Tell Baas Cogez so: I think he deny dog shelter food his old age. Keep pursuing me, I pray good him." Ere either woman dog knew he meant he stooped kissed Patrasche: closed door hurriedly, disappeared gloom fast--falling night. The woman child stood speechless joy fear: Patrasche vainly spent fury his anguish iron-bound oak barred house-door. They dare unbar door let forth: tried could solace him. They brought sweet cakes juicy meats; tempted best had; tried lure abide warmth hearth; avail. Patrasche refused comforted stir barred portal. It six of the clock opposite entrance miller last came, jaded broken, his wife's presence. "It lost forever," he said, ashen cheek quiver his stern voice. "We looked lanterns everywhere: gone--the little maiden's portion all!" His wife put money his hand, told come her. The strong man sank trembling seat covered his face, ashamed almost afraid. "I cruel lad," he muttered length: "I deserved good his hands." Little Alois, taking courage, crept close her father nestled her fair curly head. "Nello may come again, father?" she whispered. "He may come to-morrow he used do?" The miller pressed her his arms: his hard, sunburned face pale his mouth trembled. "Surely, surely," he answered his child. "He shall bide Christmas Day, day he will. God helping me, I make amends boy--I make amends." Little Alois kissed gratitude joy, slid his knees ran dog kept watch door. "And to-night I may feast Patrasche?" she cried child's thoughtless glee. Her father bent his head gravely: "Ay, ay: let dog best;" stern old man moved shaken his heart's depths. It Christmas Eve, mill-house filled oak logs squares turf, cream honey, meat bread, rafters hung wreaths evergreen, Calvary cuckoo clock looked mass holly. There little paper lanterns, too, Alois, toys various fashions sweetmeats bright-pictured papers. There light warmth abundance everywhere, child would fain made dog guest honored feasted. But Patrasche would neither lie warmth share cheer. Famished he cold, without Nello he would partake neither comfort food. Against temptation he proof, close door he leaned always, watching means escape. "He wants lad," said Baas Cogez. "Good dog! good dog! I go lad first thing day-dawn." For one Patrasche knew Nello left hut, one Patrasche divined Nello gone face starvation misery alone. The mill-kitchen warm: great logs crackled flamed hearth; neighbors came glass wine slice fat goose baking supper. Alois, gleeful sure her playmate back morrow, bounded sang tossed back her yellow hair. Baas Cogez, fulness his heart, smiled her moistened eyes, spoke way he would befriend her favorite companion; house-mother sat calm, contented face spinning-wheel; cuckoo clock chirped mirthful hours. Amidst Patrasche bidden thousand words welcome tarry cherished guest. But neither peace plenty could allure Nello not. When supper smoked board, voices loudest gladdest, Christ-child brought choicest gifts Alois, Patrasche, watching always occasion, glided door unlatched careless new-comer, swiftly his weak tired limbs would bear sped snow bitter, black night. He one thought--to follow Nello. A human friend might paused pleasant meal, cheery warmth, cosey slumber; friendship Patrasche. He remembered bygone time, old man little child found sick unto death wayside ditch. Snow fallen freshly evening long; nearly ten; trail boy's footsteps almost obliterated. It took Patrasche long discover scent. When last he found it, lost quickly, lost recovered, lost recovered, hundred times more. The night wild. The lamps wayside crosses blown out; roads sheets ice; impenetrable darkness hid every trace habitations; living thing abroad. All cattle housed, huts homesteads men women rejoiced feasted. There Patrasche cruel cold--old famished full pain, strength patience great love sustain his search. The trail Nello's steps, faint obscure new snow, went straightly along accustomed tracks Antwerp. It past midnight Patrasche traced boundaries town narrow, tortuous, gloomy streets. It quite dark town, save light gleamed ruddily crevices house-shutters, group went homeward lanterns chanting drinking-songs. The streets white ice: high walls roofs loomed black them. There scarce sound save riot winds passages tossed creaking signs shook tall lamp-irons. So many passers-by trodden snow, many diverse paths crossed recrossed other, dog hard task retain hold track he followed. But he kept his way, though cold pierced bone, jagged ice cut his feet, hunger his body gnawed like rat's teeth. He kept his way, poor gaunt, shivering thing, long patience traced steps he loved heart burgh steps great cathedral. "He gone things he loved," thought Patrasche: he could understand, he full sorrow pity art-passion incomprehensible yet sacred. The portals cathedral unclosed midnight mass. Some heedlessness custodians, eager go home feast sleep, drowsy know whether turned keys aright, left one doors unlocked. By accident foot-falls Patrasche sought passed building, leaving white marks snow upon dark stone floor. By slender white thread, frozen fell, he guided intense silence, immensity vaulted space--guided straight gates chancel, and, stretched upon stones, he found Nello. He crept touched face boy. "Didst thou dream I faithless forsake thee? I--a dog?" said mute caress. The lad raised low cry clasped close. "Let us lie die together," he murmured. "Men need us, alone." In answer, Patrasche crept closer yet, laid his head upon young boy's breast. The great tears stood his brown, sad eyes: himself--for he happy. They lay close together piercing cold. The blasts blew Flemish dikes northern seas like waves ice, froze every living thing touched. The interior immense vault stone even bitterly chill snow-covered plains without. Now bat moved shadows--now gleam light came ranks carven figures. Under Rubens lay together quite still, soothed almost dreaming slumber numbing narcotic cold. Together dreamed old glad days chased flowering grasses summer meadows, sat hidden tall bulrushes water's side, watching boats go seaward sun. Suddenly darkness great white radiance streamed vastness aisles; moon, her height, broken clouds, snow ceased fall, light reflected snow without clear light dawn. It fell arches full upon two pictures above, boy his entrance flung back veil: Elevation Descent Cross one instant visible. Nello rose his feet stretched his arms them; tears passionate ecstasy glistened paleness his face. "I seen last!" he cried aloud. "O God, enough!" His limbs failed him, he sank upon his knees, still gazing upward majesty he adored. For brief moments light illumined divine visions denied long--light clear sweet strong though streamed throne Heaven. Then suddenly passed away: great darkness covered face Christ. The arms boy drew close body dog. "We shall see His face--_there,_" he murmured; "and He part us, I think." On morrow, chancel cathedral, people Antwerp found both. They dead: cold night frozen stillness alike young life old. When Christmas morning broke priests came temple, saw lying thus stones together. Above veils drawn back great visions Rubens, fresh rays sunrise touched thorn-crowned head Christ. As day grew came old, hard-featured man wept women weep. "I cruel lad," he muttered, "and I would made amends--yea, half substance--and he son." There came also, day grew apace, painter fame world, liberal hand spirit. "I seek one prize yesterday worth won," he said people--"a boy rare promise genius. An old wood-cutter fallen tree eventide--that his theme. But greatness future it. I would fain find him, take teach Art." And little child curling fair hair, sobbing bitterly she clung her father's arm, cried aloud, "Oh, Nello, come! We ready thee. The Christ-child's hands full gifts, old piper play us; mother says thou shalt stay hearth burn nuts us Noël week long--yes, even Feast Kings! And Patrasche happy! Oh, Nello, wake come!" But young pale face, turned upward light great Rubens smile upon mouth, answered all, "It late." For sweet, sonorous bells went ringing frost, sunlight shone upon plains snow, populace trooped gay glad streets, Nello Patrasche asked charity hands. All needed Antwerp gave unbidden. Death pitiful longer life would been. It taken one loyalty love, innocence faith, world love recompense faith fulfilment. All lives together, deaths divided: found arms boy folded closely around dog severed without violence, people little village, contrite ashamed, implored special grace them, and, making one grave, laid rest side side--forever!
