 THE RAMBLES OF A RAT. CHAPTER I. THE FAMILY OF RATS. My earliest recollection running she would adjoining large warehouse, somewhere neighbourhood Poplar, close River Thames, thereabouts certainly silver stream. A merry life led she would, seven brothers I! It sort palace rubbish, mansion odds ends, rats might frolic gambol, play hide-and-seek, hearts' content. We nibbled nice little way warehouse mentioned; there, every night, feasted ease, growing sleek plump rats United Kingdom. We ancient race British rats, seven brothers I. It said ancestors came Conqueror, William; little proud Norman descent. Our smaller forms, sleek black coats, long tails, fine large ears, make us altogether distinct Norwegian brown rat, look with-- I going say contempt, I rather think quite another feeling, one neither rats men generally like plead guilty. I know usually choose keep company them; whether forms coarser, manners less refined, pedigree long, whether sometimes fancy nibble ears neighbours, or, appetite uncommonly sharp, make meal Norman cousins, need particularly inquire. I said I seven brothers black rats; I ought make one exception. The youngest family piebald-- curious peculiarity, I never noticed race. Yes, he piebald; he misfortune, he clumsiest ill-shaped rat ever nibbled candle-end! Now, fault his, certainly reason he despised his fortunate brothers. Man, course, superior creature, would look kindness pity upon companion unhappy personal defects. He would never ridicule condition might his own, find subject merriment another annoyance; inconsiderate young rats, end jokes piebald comrade. "Oddity," "Guinea-pig," "Old Spotty," "Frightful"-- names gave him. The first he best known, one he chose answer. But he good-humoured fellow, poor Oddity, bore rudeness patience temper. He pursued plan I would recommend rats his position: he joined mirth his appearance raised; made merry awkward manner he waddled his light-footed companions, he never took amiss, retired corner she would sulk, amidst rope-ends bits rusty iron. I said merry nights warehouse. Often moon looked dull, many-paned windows, lighting revels; though cared little light, delicate feelers almost supplying place eyes. But one night nights I remember! There great deal moving warehouse day, running trucks, rolling casks. Brisk, liveliest brothers, sat watching hole noon dusk, hurried little passage she would, nestling behind old canvass. He brought us news coming feast. "A ship arrived India," said he, "and we will glance cargo. They have busy stowing away next door. There is rice--" The brotherhood rats whisked tails joy! "Sugar--" There universal squeak approbation. "Indigo--" "That is nothing blue dye obtained plant," observed Furry, old, blind rat, his days travelled far, seen much world, reflected upon he viewed far common rat. Indeed, he passed amongst us philosopher, I learnt little his experience; he delighted talking his travels, little testiness temper, would agreeable companion. He frequently joined party; indeed, his infirmities obliged so, he could lived without assistance. But I must return Brisk, his catalogue cargo. "Opium--" "The juice white poppy," said aged friend, taste general information. "I have seen produce strange effects eaten large quantities men." "What effects?" said I. I inquisitive rat, especially curious related large creatures upon two legs, called Man, I believed much wiser stronger race Mus, I belong. "Why, opium makes men first wild bold, rush danger run folly, quarrel friends fight foes, laugh dance, merry know why. Then grow sleepy, though lives might depend it, step would stir. Then, awake unnatural sleep, bodies cold, heads heavy; feel sick, faint, sad! And happen day day, last strong grows weak healthy ill, flesh goes bones life eyes, whole man becomes like old, empty hulk, whose timbers hardly hold together! And eating opium!" "Ugh!" exclaimed Brisk; "leave opium man; great deal bad rats!" CHAPTER II. A CLAP-TRAP DISCOVERY. With eager haste scrambled warehouse, Furry, usual, remaining behind account his infirmities. We almost impatient wait till men within finished work, till doors shut locked, place left quiet us. I soon found singular curiosity-- tooth; I felt certain tooth; twice long rat, counting tip his nose end his tail! I could help wondering mind huge animal could ever belonged. "Is not called ivory?" said Oddity, he waddled past me. I felt inexpressible pleasure gnawing nibbling huge tusk, polishing sharp teeth upon it. "How I like see enormous rat could carried tusk!" I exclaimed. "Oh! I delight travelling seeing world!" "You have something see worth seeing, without travelling far!" cried Brisk. "Such fragrance cheese yonder! Why, Ratto, delicious scent reaches us even here!" I busy tusk reflections, I scarcely looked up; Oddity turned his eyes eagerly towards spot. "Now, I propose race place!" cried Brisk; "and he gets first shall his pick feast! Leave Ratto his old bone! Here seven us: it; once, twice, thrice, away!" Off scampered helter-skelter, seven brothers, awkward heavy Oddity, usual, rear. He often laughed his slowness, time well he slow! On rushed six foremost, almost together, scrambling one another haste; disappeared looked like dark hole, then-- alas! alas! terrible squeaking! Poor unhappy brothers! caught trap! All mercy cruel enemy, man! I ran spot terrible fright. Nothing six companions could I see; Oddity, disconsolate look, staring drop trap. His narrow escape,-- grazed his ugly nose fell! This melancholy part story, I hasten fast I can. In vain poor captive rats tried gnaw way freedom within, Oddity I nibbled without. There something defied even sharp little teeth, efforts vain. My poor brothers could touch fatal feast lured ruin! They passed miserable night, every one carried bag worried dogs morning! "Cruel, wicked man!" I exclaimed, piebald companion I sought old shelter behind canvass she would. My exclamation overheard old Furry. "Cruel, wicked man!" he repeated, different tone mine; "well, I think even setting trap catch inexperienced rats, man may something say himself. I often noticed big creatures work, much labour, hard toil, cannot expect willing take much trouble collect dainties feast us! Those live property others, like rats, right expect civil treatment!" "Are creatures lay traps man?" said I, bitterness spirit almost hoping might be. "As well I understand," replied Furry, "man lays traps man. I seen several traps. They large, generally built brick, board gilt letters front. They baited certain drink, effects something like opium, destroys slowly surely give recklessly enjoyment." "Well," cried Oddity, "having seen comes running trap, I, one, shall always guard them, never likely caught way. I suppose man. When he sees one two his companions lost big man-trap, he takes good care never go near himself." "Not whit!" exclaimed Furry, scornful whisk his tail. "They like bait, though know effects quite well. They walk open eyes great man-trap, hasten merrily great man-trap, gas-lights flaring, spirits flowing, sound laughter jesting heard within! They know going straight, direct way worried sickness, poverty, shame, (what I never heard clearly explained, I gathered great enemies man, always waiting door great man-trap,) yet go gaily ruin!" "So account wise creature man!" I exclaimed; "he great deal foolish rat!" CHAPTER III. POORER THAN RATS. We she would always ourselves. One cold evening autumn, sharp east wind, drizzling rain, two human creatures came place cowered corner she would. I call human creatures, certainly men; different tall powerful fellows I occasionally seen work warehouse. These much smaller, thin bones seemed almost ready break skin. Their hair hung long loose masses ears. They nothing feet protect stones, one hurt upon his heel, looked red inflamed. I found young human beings, neglected uncared for, young rats would been. We first afraid them, peered curiously upon holes hiding-places; when, gathering courage, ventured come forward, seemed frighten much frightened us. "Look there-- there, Bob!" screamed younger child, clinging closely his brother. "Them bees rats," said one quietly. His poor thin little face looked life spirit starved it, he could much astonished anything. "I do not like staying here, Bob, amongst rats!" cried terrified little one, attempting pull his brother towards entrance sleeve his jacket. The wretched rag gave way even his weak pull, another rent added many cold crept poor boy's tattered dress. "I will not stay here; let us go, let us go!" "We have no-where is go to," replied Bob, dull, lifeless tone. "Never mind rats, Billy, will not hurt you," he added. Hurt him! we! If ever I felt pity ragged little urchins. We well-fed, hungry; Nature given us sleek warm coats, trembled cold. It clear much harder support life rats. I wondered great city many helpless children, none care them! "I say, Ratto," observed Oddity, licking his soft coat till beautiful polish upon made one almost forget ugly colour, "it is pity children dirty; may particular matters rats." In time sort acquaintance grew ragged boys. We ceased fear other, I would venture almost close Billy's thin little hand he crust bread eat, he always broke little bit me. The poor little fellow crippled lame, he rarely left she would. Bob often went morning, returned growing dark, sometimes food, sometimes without it; whenever he anything eat, he always shared his little lame brother. I see now, crouched close together sake warmth. Sometimes Billy cried hunger cold, his tears made long lines his grimy face. Bob never cried, he suffered quite quietly; he patted his little brother's shaggy head, spoke kindly him, his dull, cheerless way. I felt sorry Billy. The little one talkative two. Perhaps he lively his nature; perhaps, shorter time world sorrow, he learned sad lessons well. I certainly never heard laugh once, Oddity, shy I, ventured first time since Billy's coming cross she would. "Oh! look-- look, Bob! funny rat! beauty rat!" he cried, clapping his bony hands together childish glee. It comical see expression Oddity's blunt face hearing unexpected compliment, perhaps first he ever received his life. It enough turned head less sober rat; he, honest fellow, lifted his snub nose sort bull-dog look, seemed say, "Well, there is accounting taste." "Bob," said little Billy one evening, animation usual, "I'se a-watching rats, I saw-- think I saw!" "Eh, ye see?" replied Bob, drowsily, rubbing his eyes back his hand. He looked hungry tired. "I a-watching fat spotted one ran across yesterday, came creeping, creeping, two others" --the child his fingers floor suited his action his words,-- "and one white back; looked old weak; Bob, I saw blind." "A blind rat!" cried Bob; "'twould soon starve, I take it." "But rat side, shining eyes, sharp little nose!" I plead guilty vanity; I could hear description Oddity's sober composure. "And old blind rat little bit stick mouth, blind man lane stick his hand, pretty black rat took end his teeth, pulled old un his way." "I'se never heard rats afore," said Bob. "That is I saw  them," continued Billy. "Out comes funny spotted rat hole; I keeps quiet, frighten away. And pattered place I put little crumbs; think did?" "Ate them," Bob's quiet reply. "No, did not though!" cried Billy, triumphantly; "it pushed towards old blind rat. Neither black un spotted un ate one crumb; left  them poor blind rat! Now was not famous little fellows!" "So rats help one another," said Bob. He speak more; he leant back his head, looked straight roof she would, (there great hole stars shone through, big drop water top came plash, plash, muddy floor below,) he looked up, I say, I wonder whether he thinking thing I moment: "Rats help one another; none human beings leave fellow-creatures perish!" CHAPTER IV. HOW I MADE A FRIEND. I always ate supper warehouse, I need hardly say Oddity I carefully avoided spot tragedy six brothers occurred. We means rats found living place expense enemy, man. There good many species large brown Norwegian rat; I mentioned before, usually kept way, tender regard ears. There one brown rat, however, whose fame spread, his tribe, ours. For quickness wit, readiness danger, strength teeth, courage using them, I never yet met his equal. Whiskerandos hero rat. Was he single combat met conquered young ferret! exploit quite sufficient establish his fame warrior. They opposed room lighted single window. Whiskerandos, whose intelligence showed importance position, took his station beneath window, light his enemy's eyes, compelled fight disadvantage. For two long hours battle lasted, length ferret lay dead upon floor! Several scars upon neck Whiskerandos bore witness terrible encounter, many others he engaged. He lost one ear, grievously curtailed proportions, altogether he paid fame price beauty; he strong bold ever, his appearance one night warehouse created quite sensation community rats. There one brown rat, particular, seemed wait upon him, pay court, though, merit his own, Shabby fancied he could borrow little distinguished companion. I often seen life, (I old experienced rat,) I seen mean race following flattering superiors, ready lick dust feet, real admiration attachment, but, like mistletoe upon forest tree, proper footing own, liked raised credit another. It easier fawn work, flatter great follow example. I I afraid Whiskerandos, yet he passed without touching me, quite meanness hurting creature merely weaker himself. But Shabby gave savage snap ear I retreated squeaking corner. I almost think I returned bite, his formidable companion near; probably circumstance gave mean rat courage thus attack without provocation. From I heard boys tormenting cats, mice, birds, anything easily master, pay proper respect bulldogs mastiffs, I idea Shabbys found even amongst "the lords creation." I busy supper, when, chancing look towards fatal hole six brothers caught, I saw Whiskerandos his follower merrily advancing towards it, doubtless attracted, former victims been, enticing scent. I know man would behaved position. These certainly friends mine; rats; race Mus. I could see perish without warning danger. "Stop! stop!" squeaked I, keeping, however, respectful distance; "you running right trap!" Whiskerandos turned sharp round faced me. I retreated back several steps. "Bite him,-- fight him,-- shake neck!" cried Shabby; "he knows dainty feast there, he would keep his ugly black rats!" Shabby great fighter words; his character usually are; he least particular, he gave his bad names, least suitable appropriate, he would never applied term "ugly" us. "You will pay dainty feast go one foot farther!" I exclaimed; feeling, I confess it, angry. "Who is afraid!" cried boaster, flinging his hind legs saucy flourish he scampered on. Clap! he caught trap! Poor rat! he possessed courage skill Whiskerandos himself, would availed nothing. His miserable squeaking louder six brothers put together. He would take advice, he found consequences. He thought wiser his neighbours, discovered his mistake led destruction. Had he listened counsels little black rat! Whiskerandos remained moments quite still, looking towards dismal prison his companion. He knew well impossible rescue now. Then, bounds rats could make, he sprang I standing. "Rat!" he exclaimed, "you saved life, I shall never forget obligation. Though black I brown, difference us shall ever regarded. Let us friends end days!" "Agreed!" I cried; "let us rub noses upon it!" noses accordingly rubbed. He never flinched his word, bold Whiskerandos. I never feared hour; no, even I knew he hungry, tasted food morning till night; I knew extremity would ever induce eat his friend; many ramble together, many strange paths he led me. I ventured even haunts brown rats, his presence sufficient protection. None would dared attack he beside me,-- I hardly afraid cat! I naturally fancy roving, great desire know world; better guide could I heroic Whiskerandos? He not, however, great traveller Furry,-- he never yet crossed water; he I determined, favourable opportunity, take passage ship, explore foreign region together. There one subject Whiskerandos I ever danger quarrelling. I made mind-- Furry, learned rat, quite opinion-- ancestors brown rats came Hanover England George I. We liked call Hanover rats, gave great offence race, made antiquity much less claimed ourselves. "You affirm," Whiskerandos would exclaim, "that came Normandy 1066, Hanover 1714, nothing ever heard us time. I affirm calumny, base calumny! We came Persia, land East; army us swam across Volga, driven earthquake country. Depend upon it, known ancient times, went Xerxes' great bridge boats, nibbled his tent-ropes gnawed his cheese he fought Greeks Thermopylæ." "After all," thought I-- I say aloud, great weakness Whiskerandos his pride birth, his anxiety thought ancient family-- "the great matter whether ancestors honour us, whether conduct disgrace ancestors." CHAPTER V. HOW BOB MET WITH AN ADVENTURE. I often puzzled conduct Bob; expected, seeing I young ignorant rat, quite inexperienced doings man. Once twice Bob brought she would things he could eat wear. I could neither imagine he got them, he intended them, possible use he could make them. He seemed inclined hide them; once, he showing Billy red handkerchief covered white spots (though weather bitterly cold, he never attempted tie round his neck), little boy looked gravely his face said, "Oh, Bob, arn't afeard?" "What I do; cannot starve, Billy." He looked wan woe-begone, he bent little lame child, seemed never creature wretched desolate boy. The next morning he took away handkerchief, evening he brought home bread. Once he returned, snow fast falling, drifting roof, door, till Billy could scarcely find clear spot rest his languid little frame. He always look-out his brother, soon sky began darken. Well might he watch day, he broken his fast since evening before; his lips blue hunger cold, he lonely, lonely, she would. Presently Bob came hastily in; heard his step soft snow. The flakes resting his rags whitening his hair, he threw his brother. "Oh! Billy!" he exclaimed, burst tears. "What got?" cried little one joyfully. "A big loaf!" he tore asunder his eager haste, ate like famished creature. "And see this!" said Bob; he wrapped round shivering child warm cloak he carried his arm. Billy opened his eyes expression astonishment, brightened joy he felt unwonted warmth. "Oh! Bob!" he exclaimed, his mouth full bread; "where get this? Did steal it?" "No; I will never steal more; never, never!" boy sank his head upon his chest, sobbed. I never seen she would tear till day. "Tell it, tell me!" cried Billy, almost frightened his brother's unwonted emotion; little time Bob made reply. "I followed he-- fine, tall gemman. I fingers his pocket, he clapped his hand  them, catched me!" "Oh!" exclaimed Billy, eyes mouth wide open, alarm. "And he call beaks, up?" "No; he spoke me; he spoke kind-like. He told I sin-- great sin. Nobody never spoke afore!" Again boy's feelings seemed ready burst forth. "And he took baker's, got this; shop, bought that; says he, "Has one taught know right wrong?" And says I, "Nobody never taught nothing!" Then he takes good way round, little lane, right Ragged School." "What is that?" inquired Billy curiously. "A place great many poor boys together big room, wooden benches, pictures things hung walls. I never dared go in; good gemman took me, led right man standing row little chaps afore him. And gemman put his hand shoulder, spoke me, said many things I cannot remember; one thing I remember quite well: "You come every evening," says he, "and you will taught duty, it. I leaving London soon; I back weeks, I will come ask master behaving; I find you have trying become better boy, I lose sight you, friend." "Did gemman say that?" exclaimed Billy. "And great deal more. Such beautiful talking! And see gentle kind he looked, he did not think bad un all!" "Did tell me?" asked Billy anxiously. "Yes; I told I one little brother, he lame; mother dead father jail, one care us, often hungry, always cold; he looked quite sorry hear it." "Did he though?" cried Billy, much surprised. "And go Ragged School, Bobby?" "Will not I!" cried boy, little energy I seen before; "why, I do not, I will not see good gemman again!" "And will not take too?" said little Billy. CHAPTER VI. HOW I VISITED THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS. That night I set Whiskerandos extended travels I yet attempted. Oddity might accompanied us, he preferred, he said, home comforts nibble warehouse. I knew he would look old Furry, whose infirmities sadly increasing upon him, I fear blind rat neglected. I suspected one reason induced pie-bald brother decline tour. He struck acquaintance Bright-eyes, lively little rat, probably found his society agreeable Whiskerandos, he always stood somewhat awe. I shall pause description underland journey wondrous labyrinth passages which, like net-work, spreads every direction foundations London. I saw rats gloomy lanes I ever imagined existed world. I afraid passed them, fierce looked, ready attack intruder, Whiskerandos side. He neither provoked contests, feared them-- neither gave offence willingly, took readily-- withal resolute air, would disposed quarrelled him. I heartily glad, however, emerged light day; I full astonishment sight green grass trees, I never beheld before. "Ah!" said Whiskerandos, smiling delight, "you see grass fresh spring, black bare trees bright young leaves upon them. The branches yonder row seem dropping blossoms gold; sweet scent hawthorn! But I would pass iron paling examine closely beauties garden; square would charming place, doubt, haunted cats." I never seen cat life, I started instinctively name. "Take anywhere," I exclaimed, "take anywhere will, I never come sight one terrible creatures!" "I going," said Whiskerandos, "to take cats huge one could take man's head her mouth, strike dead blow her paw!" "Oh, she would! Oh, quiet hole! Furry, Oddity, peaceable companions!" thought I. "What folly venture world guide desperado, Whiskerandos!" I suppose bold rat read thoughts frightened face, he hastened reassure mind. "The big cats," said he, "some long flowing manes, spotted, striped black yellow, power harm us. They kept barred cages man, spend lives wearisome captivity, denied even solace amusing catching mouse supper." It dawn winter's morning, comrade I merrily made way across park. The grass whitened hoar-frost, also glittered leafless boughs rows trees lined long straight avenue. We entered gardens without paying toll, way obtruding notice man. "See here!" exclaimed Whiskerandos, half pettishly, passed pond curious wire-fence round it. "What dainty breakfast make delicate young water-fowl, extraordinary care taken shut us out! We look in, sure, see prey, ducks even flutter, move wing, secure cannot reach them!" The season winter, unable see many animals tropical climes, whose health would suffered exposure cold. I however regretted little. The white bear shaking his shaggy coat, wolf pacing uneasily his den, birds pluming feathers dull red light, monkeys' ceaseless jabber sounded walls prison. "Whiskerandos," said I guide, "I care little making acquaintance cats, whether little big; foreigners race Mus kept here, might I request introduce them?" Whiskerandos pointed his nose towards building. "You find relations there," he said, "some forty-six classes race, known family likeness teeth.* For me, I am going pay visit monkeys' house; I am sure find provision, always matter importance rat. The door shut, I will trouble keeper open me!" So saying, wonderful agility he began climb building, soon vanished hole roof. Food subject least great importance Whiskerandos. Even curiosity wait attendance appetite. I fortunate, however, discovering half bun, probably dropped child; cheered refreshed I proceeded building I make affectionate search distant relations. I carefully examined walls, till I discovered hole, probably made rat place, I entered house, proceeded eagerness small barred division, whence feeble squeak proceeded. [* I aware whether Zoological Gardens present contain specimens curious rats described following chapter.] CHAPTER VII. FINDING RELATIONS. "Well, length weather creature may live breathe in! I have half stifled autumn heat, fresh keen air seems like breeze dear Lapland!" "Lapland! oh! nothing like Lapland," said dolorous voice reply. I lifted eyes get glimpse speaker. Within cage two beautiful little Lemmings, (I learnt name afterwards well inhabitants place.) They much half size, pointed heads, short tails, whiskers uncommonly long. Their coats black tawny, yellowish-white beneath. I heard subsequently race inhabit Siberia, Norway, cold climes, moving large bodies like locusts, like locusts eating every thing green. But pair, evident conversation, natives country called Lapland. "Oh sight icy lakes, snow-covered plains reindeer moving lightly them; rosy Aurora Borealis throws bright streamers across sky!" "And strange little huts," rejoined other, "made briers, bark, felt, reindeer skins, where, peeped curtains made door, saw tiny people, sheepskin doublets, sitting heels round fire! I do not wonder Lapps love land; I do not wonder long exiled it, die intense longing return. That fate, oh! mine!" "Allow English rat, gentle strangers," said I, "to offer little word comfort. I grieve feel captivity much, deeply mourn absence dear native land. But better meet misfortune courage, bear patience? You yet left society other, yet talk old days together, white bear growls his prison alone, lofty camel companion near him." I interrupted animal near dashing passionately bars cage, and, turning round, I beheld savage rat, bore name German Hamster. His head thick, blunt, garnished plenty whiskers; he big eyes, large, open, rounded ears. His back head reddish-brown colour, his cheeks red, his feet white, he three odd white spots side his chest. But funniest thing I noticed him, (I always observant rat,) he claw his forefeet addition four toes, I never seen tribes Mus. "It Is easy talk comfort!" he exclaimed angrily, "when rat freedom everything else he cares for! But here-- I even comfort going sleep fashion country!" "Not going sleep!" I repeated surprise, thinking peevish creature must certainly best his sleep. "No; sleep bare boards, poor sprinkling straw!" he exclaimed, striking contemptuously floor his cage. "I used burrow deep earth, enjoy long nap winter, shut snug little home, I know comfort is! There nothing like lying feet earth, quiet one dead, know good magazine collected grain, beans, pease, feast one awakes spring." "But rate well fed," I suggested. The words, however kindly intended, effect increasing Hamster's passion shocking extent. To amazement horror he blew his cheeks till size his head neck exceeded his body. He raised his hind legs, bars his cage I believe he would really flown me. "Well fed!" he exclaimed, soon he could speak; "I like know call well fed! Since I come hateful country, I opportunity filling cheeks grain. Man, stingy man, thinks enough give wretched pittance day day,-- hundred pounds corn packed deep hole,-- whose delight carry three ounces weight bags Nature provided face!" "Most curious convenient bags are," said I, willing appease civil word, though I thought thus puffed air, anything added beauty his appearance. "They taken," cried fierce Hamster, whose savage complaints quite silenced gentler murmurs pretty little Lemmings, done perhaps make submissive lot anything I could said. "How pouches taken?" inquired I. "I fight savagely-- I fly even dogs," replied Hamster (no one could looked doubted it,) "but I cannot bite cheeks stuffed full grain, case German peasant seized me; I time empty them, moment, would not I bitten him! oh, would I bitten him!" I felt much disgusted words manner ferocious rats, I glad turn away his cage; reflecting hideous hateful creature rendered violent passion. A perfume, rather powerful agreeable, drew attention towards division occupied Musk-Rat, native Canada. I saw within creature size small rabbit, quiet staid his demeanour, welcomed grave courtesy strangely contrast rudeness Hamster. "May I venture look upon belonging race Mus?" I inquired, looking doubtingly his large size, soft fur, long flat tail. "Well," he replied, good-humouredly, "some naturalists, I believe great Linnæus amongst them, class Castor Beaver race, dignify long learned-sounding name, Zibethicus. But I quite content, part, relationship race Mus, known simple name Musk-Rat, give lakes Canada." "I delighted," said I, wave whiskers, "at opportunity paying respects dignified relation." "Ah!" replied Zibethicus, "I wish I could received house upon Lake Huron. If could seen pretty round dwelling raised companions-- neat dome-shaped roof covered it, formed herbs reeds cemented clay. So prettily stuccoed within! A great deal trouble cost us, sure, I often think there is pleasure without trouble; there is nothing captivity I miss much power labour build." "May I ask," said I, "whether family Musk Cavy, I heard inhabiting Ceylon places East?" "I believe not," answered courteous companion, "but doubtless belong race, however habits appearance may differ." Our pleasant conversation unfortunately interrupted keeper's opening door. I barely time hide straw, resolving show till darkness render safe creep out. Soon various visitors arrived, I vastly amused watching different varieties human species, must nearly many race Mus. For first time life I saw ladies bedizened velvets silks, furry spoils many unfortunate ermine sable. I saw gentlemen too, I confess creeping uncomfortable feeling came I looked hats heads, fine black gloss exceedingly like coat I wore. I since learnt conjecture close fact-- numberless hapless rats slaughtered France account fatal beauty; man manufactures fur hats, uses soft delicate skins make thumbs his best gloves. Alas, race Mus! CHAPTER VIII. HOW I HEARD OF OLD NEIGHBOURS. In afternoon gentleman entered building, whose noble commanding appearance struck me. After short examination captives cages, he sat rest nearly opposite place I hidden. He almost directly joined bright-haired boy, whose cheeks health glowing, whose blue eyes sparkled intelligence enjoyment. "Papa-- please-- I want money buy buns animals!" "My dear boy," replied gentleman, expostulating tone, "you whole dozen already; I think right spend pampering well-fed animals, many fellow-creatures suffering hunger." "Oh, papa! think many?" "I believe city London alone thousands,-- yes, tens thousands, know not, rise morning, shall find morsel food day. I tell happened I city, Neddy." "Do tell now," cried boy, seating his father, "while rest little quietly here." "I walking along narrow gloomy lane way shipping-office, suddenly I felt hand pocket. Mine instantly upon it, I captured little thief appeared age." "The little rogue!" exclaimed Neddy, indignantly. "And him, papa? Did give police, thrash soundly stick?" "I grieved see one young already plunging crime." "Yes, worst it," said Neddy. "If he bad boy, he he man! He sure end gallows! I hope punished well, papa." I pricked ears hearing conversation; I could help connecting Bob told his lame little brother; I therefore listened peculiar interest. Not that, rat, I could understand word _crime_, know human beings feel wrong seize anything want get. It evident governed laws principles quite incomprehensible race. For man scruple taking rats lives skins, rats, hand, manner scruple taking require man. But return gentleman his son. "No, Neddy, I punish child," replied former gravely. "I looked his meagre form clothed rags, his wasted countenance prematurely old expression sorrow care, his hollow eyes, his sunken cheeks,-- I thought you, son!" gentleman added, sigh. "Well," said Neddy, "I hope there is precious deal difference beggarly thief!" "What made difference?" said gentleman, laying his hand shoulder his beautiful boy. "I questioned unhappy child. I found ignorant first principles virtue. His mother dead, his father jail; he learnt anything around knowledge vice. Pinched hunger, homeless, friendless, ignorant even he soul, would miracle indeed he followed straight path he much heard! What expect thief,-- would his place?" Neddy looked thoughtful silent. Then raising his blue eyes his father's face he said, "And boy?" "I first tried relieve little his pressing bodily wants; take him, least one day, temptation commit theft. But I knew temptation would recur again, long he continued blind ignorance, could small hope he would even wish resist it. I remembered watchmaker given direction Ragged School his daughter taught; spending her time energies many now, noblest labour love. This school far off, I resolved take opportunity paying long-intended visit. I took poor little fellow me, spoke superintendent, readily agreed receive him. He learn way earn his bread honestly; he taught know right wrong; he hear, perhaps first time, voice kindness; he may yet live respectable, useful, happy." "Oh! papa, think thief he ever likely turn good anything!" "The experiment tried again, Neddy, many times mercifully attended success. The idle _have_ become industrious, thieves honest, vicious reclaimed, lost found saved! I tell striking occurrence really took place reformatory thieves. Not one inmates broken laws his country, committed crime theft. But mercy giving chance redeem characters lost, learning various trades, support honest independence. A subscription, may remember, raised time war Russia, help widows orphans gallant soldiers. From Sovereign her throne, labourer field, rich poor, high low, contributions Patriotic Fund poured in. "The thieves reformatory heard subscription; longed aid it, could do? money, owed bread charity, yet acquired sufficient skill trades learning, pay even necessary expenses." "They could give got, papa, wished generous ever much." "Where way, Neddy. These poor fellows anxious help widow orphan, asked obtained leave go whole day without food, money saved upon might paid Patriotic Fund." "And really starve whole day?-- neither breakfast, dinner, supper,-- go hungry bed?" "They did, Neddy, _all_ thieves reformatory* did; I doubt amongst hundreds thousands subscriptions Patriotic Fund, showed much real generosity self-denial contribution reformed thieves!" "Oh! hope men indeed!" exclaimed Neddy, moisture rising his eyes. "There must good them, papa, I wonder turned really fine fellows." "I doubt it," said his father smile. "And poor boy-- yes, I hope he may amend. Shall hear anything him, papa?" "You know go town to-morrow. On return I shall make inquiries regarding Ragged School, I find he improving instruction he receive, I shall try something him." "May I go you?" said Neddy eagerly, "I like visit school." "I think I shall take me," replied his father. "What glorious thing is," exclaimed boy pause, "to raise ragged schools reformatories, give poor, ignorant, wicked, chance becoming honest happy! How I like build one myself!" "It would practicable you," observed gentleman, smiling he rose his seat, "to support built already."** "But, papa, I little!" "Every little helps, son; vast ocean made drops. You may something yourself, try interest others desolate poor. Were children middle classes England give one penny a-week, wretched boy need wander desolate London, perish hereafter one cared his soul!" [* The Reformatory Great Smith Street, Westminster.] [** The office "Ragged School Union" 1 Exeter Hall, London. By admirable society twenty-two thousand poor children received instruction past year, five hundred destitute provided homes refuges reformatories. To show habits prudence inculcated schools, necessary state year ragged scholars placed saving-banks sum less three thousand four hundred thirty-nine pounds! Seventy teach schools, ragged scholars themselves, thus imparting others benefits received poor ignorant children. But funds society means sufficient work it, though many teachers unpaid, seeking reward upon earth. There numbers ragged children London, desolate I described, never known blessing ragged school, who, implored shelter refuge, must implore vain, would find room.] CHAPTER IX. HOW WE FOUND A FEAST. I remained Zoological Gardens weeks, improving acquaintance mild Zibethicus gentle Lemmings. As German Hamster, he became drowsy weather grew colder, became evident he could sleep day night upon boards, though he never fell perfectly torpid, almost dead state he would done, could he humoured buried alive. I willingly remained longer gardens, keepers taking stringent measures get rid rats, thought better remove four feet could, instead carried bag, kind conveyance fancy. We therefore set journey homewards. We chose underland route, lest meet dogs cats streets, crushed beneath rolling wheels. We gone far, however, Whiskerandos suddenly stopped. "I feel hungry," said he. "So I," rejoined I. "We must find way one houses," observed bold rat; "let us turn passage, doubtless leads kitchen." Down passage accordingly turned, Whiskerandos, usual, going first; met, almost entrance, two savage brown rats, seem disposed allow us pass. "Pray, passage lead kitchen?" said Whiskerandos, appearing notice sharp teeth gleaming eyes. "Yes," replied one; "but passage, house, kitchen, belong us, let one share rights." "Any one attempts pass," cried other, fiercely, "has pay us toll his ears!" "Well, good friends," replied Whiskerandos, "notwithstanding darkness I doubt bright eyes observed I paid toll already, kind toll one expected pay twice." The brown rats looked warrior keen, wondering gaze, Whiskerandos calmly continued, "I lost ears single combat ferret; he exacted toll lost his life exchange, I feel somehow persuaded rather politely guide house share whatever I get there, try experiment whether rat fight well without ears he them." This little speech wonderful effect subduing unfriendly inhospitable feelings part brown rats towards valiant Whiskerandos. They, however, looked suspiciously me, I fancied I heard one whisper other, "There is black rat-- intruder-- enemy-- must tear pieces!" I felt uncommonly uncomfortable, much inclined turn round scamper life; Whiskerandos soon ended difficulty. "Let introduce friend Ratto," said he, "my particular friend, goes I go, shares I find, whose safety I value own." Nothing said tearing pieces, proceeded amicably way, till brown rats led us small hole, found large, airy kitchen. The place perfectly quiet; loud ticking clock sound heard, swing pendulum motion seen, except black beetles creeping sanded floor. The fire, must large one, almost burnt out; red embers still glowing, served light us way, though, I mentioned before, light seems unnecessary rats. We peeped about, dresser, shelves, snuffed locked door larder, nothing could discover fit food. A jar shelf looked tempting enough, made, cover all, crockery ware, defied even sharp little teeth. "I have made discovery!" exclaimed I last, shout three rats came eagerly running towards place I stood rejoicing flask oil. "I have seen flask dozen times," exclaimed one Brownies, tone angry disappointment; "I longed taste contents, rat get them?" Here puzzler indeed. But Whiskerandos ever ready expedients. With neat dexterity he extracted stopper; difficulty end, neck bottle narrow far admit head rat; position flask, wooden box, rendered impossible alter position pour contents. "Mighty little use flask us!" exclaimed one Brownies, impatiently. But clever rat easily discouraged In moment he dipped his long tail, whisking again, scattered around fragrant shower oil! There end praises commendations Whiskerandos received simple device. He took little notice them, however, playfully observed, "It Ratto thought this, since nature furnished black rats two hundred fifty distinct rings tails, brown ones two hundred." "Ah, Whiskerandos!" exclaimed I, "this oil nice relish sure, appetite craves something solid;" I looked piteously jar. The rats looked piteously also. "Let us see do!" cried spirited companion; he clambered second time shelf stood tantalizing jar. This time he even attempt nibble hard polished crockery, he wasted his energies fruitless endeavour; but, putting his mighty strength task, he pushed whole jar nearer nearer edge shelf, it, till length fell tremendous crash made every one us leap high air amazement! We might leapt joy also, broken crockery feast delicious dried fruits rolled forth! With glee set supper, Whiskerandos sprang his shelf, eager partake tempting repast take slower method climbing. I must confess pleasures upon earth none rat like eating; case lords creation, I say must content reckoned like rats. We midst feast, mouths full, whiskers merrily wagging, startled faint noise kitchen door. A stealthy sound, human feet moving slowly cautiously along; timid hand laid softly handle door; whispering murmur voices. We pricked ears stopped eating. "I sure noise came kitchen;-- listen!" said timorous voice. So without listened, within, clock suddenly striking One, made us start, frightened Brownies, scampered hole. Whiskerandos I retreated steps, remained attitude attention, whispering began. "Would safer call policeman?" "No, no,-- blunderbuss loaded, villains cannot escape. You nervous-- go back, Eliza." "Dearest-- I will never leave meet danger alone!" The handle creaked slowly turned round, Whiskerandos exclaiming, "We would better off!" followed example Brownies. Strong curiosity made linger moment, door opened inch inch, I glimpse day I cannot remember without laughing. One lords creation slowly advanced it, robed long red dressing-gown, candle one hand, loaded blunderbuss other, ludicrous expression his pallid face, though he making his mind kill somebody, little afraid somebody might kill instead! His wife, looking ghastly her curl-papers her eyes mouth wide open fright, trying pull back, evidently terrified glance round kitchen, lest midnight robber meet her gaze. Away I scudded, sides shaking mirth, leaving broken jar scattered fruits tell tale, wondering stories midnight alarms valiant husband his devoted spouse would amuse family morning. CHAPTER X. THE WANT OF A DENTIST. I glad see Oddity's kind ugly face native she would. How much I tell him! much older I felt one never wandered hundred yards his home! Who knows pleasure returning even brief absence, full information, eager impart it, sure ready attentive listener? I talked adventures brother, till patience his would exhausted; he patient rats, quite willing his adventures second-hand, without slightest wish become hero, ready, without particle envy, admire exploits others. "And old Furry?" I asked, length I came end narration. Furry taken his quarters warehouse, sometimes visited she would. Oddity looked grave. "You know," replied he, "that poor Furry misfortune time ago lose one his upper front teeth." "I know it; he struck gnawing hoop barrel. But I see misfortune great; old Furry teeth left." "_That_ his misfortune," added Oddity. "How?-- mean?-- he complain of,-- losing his teeth keeping them?" "Both," said Oddity. I thought joking, Oddity never guilty joke his life. "You see," he continued, observing look surprise, "that gnawing necessary us rats, keep quick growth teeth. If constantly rubbing one another, soon get great deal long mouths. As poor old Furry's upper tooth gone, course one work, nothing else do, growing pace, actually forming circle his mouth!" "You do not say so!" I exclaimed "I often noticed strange length tooth, I notion extent evil." "It much increased since left us," sighed Oddity, "and end I really do not know. The poor fellow blind, he pleasure nibbling chatting, his dreadful long tooth actually locking his jaw." "Shall I go see him?" said I. "Do please," replied Oddity. "There little pleasure seeing now, poor fellow." And I found I went. Poor old Furry's misfortune means sweetened his temper. He ready bite one approached him, biting question. He could hardly manage swallow little meal Oddity procured, certainly took without sign gratitude. One would thought, his manner towards piebald rat, he knocked unlucky front tooth, instead kindly attended Furry's wants long, borne his temper, harder. But Oddity was, without doubt, patient steady rats. While Bright-eyes, full fun, made many joke expense blind, crabbed old rat, fond talking, could scarcely utter squeak-- eating, could nibble nut,-- Oddity never thought sufferings another subject smile, peevishness infirmities age theme ridicule young. He often laughed himself; perhaps reason he never gave pain others. I really glad escape back she would atmosphere peevish temper. I accompanied Oddity. "And now, dear old rat," said I, alone, "how go little ragged friends? What become Bob Billy?" "They still live, rather starve, old she would," said he; "but go day together. I expect every minute." "So poor ever?" inquired I. "I heard something occasional treats warm soup school, I do not think get anything certain. I suppose then, good folk sit comfortable meal, beside roaring fire, happen remember seventy eighty half-famished children gathered together street near, send welcome supply. But Bob Billy hope now, nothing else; expect soon able something themselves, helped kind friends found school." "Has Bob brought home red handkerchiefs white spots?" inquired I. "Not rag one," answered companion; "but he brings back something puzzles brain-- something white, black marks upon it. He little Billy sit poring hour. They do not eat it, do not smell it, do not wear it: I cannot make use all; yet seem much pleased, study together, piece Dutch cheese!" "What odd things scattered she would?" said I; "I do not remember seeing before." "Ah! I forgot say little one beginning make baskets, neat fingers he it: seems quite pleasure child. The talk boys growing different now; elder--" He stopped sound distant cough, became distressing every minute, till two poor boys entered she would, Bob sank wearily floor. "Oh! cough, shakes you!" cried Billy. "Never mind, 'twill soon," gasped his brother. I much surprised change boys' appearance, first I could hardly believe eyes. They looked much whiter I seen before; hair cut closer, brushed one side, instead hanging right eyes. Neither brothers rags; old worn clothes indeed still there, neatly patched mended; one given Bob pair old shoes, Billy wore warm cloak. "His brother always makes wear it," whispered Oddity, "except night, covers both." "Now must it, Bob; is not comfy?" said lame child, pressing cloak round his brother, whose violent cough moment prevented his reply, brought bright colour his cheek, I never seen before. "I will creep close you, Bobby, we will it, know. There! better now?" he said, softly, laying his thin cheek his brother. "I do not think I will ever get better here." The boy shivered closed his eyes he spoke. "Oh, Bob! Bob!" cried child, accents fear, "you are a-going ill like mother; you are a-going to-- die, leave me!" There something gentle tone, sweet uplift eye, poor destitute boy, he replied, "I cannot say I am a-going die, Billy; do not mind Miss Mary told us dying? I used afeared I thought it, now-- I think I could die happy!" "But must not-- shall go leave me! Oh! I without you?" cried Billy, bursting tears. CHAPTER XI. A REMOVAL. A manly voice heard outside, speaking porter passing moment. "Can tell me, pray, whether two boys name Parton live near place? From direction given me, I think must near dwelling." "Parton?-- well," began porter, doubtful voice; little Billy moment: "Yes, are! here is live!" shouted he, next minute she would entered gentleman his son I seen Zoological Gardens. The father almost started he glanced round miserable place, look pity his face deepened one pain, Neddy appeared even shocked. He had, I suspect, known little poverty, hearsay; bare, terrible reality took surprise. Bob risen heap dirty rubbish served bed. His thin cheek glowed bright flush pleasure he recognised his benefactor. "Is possible live here?-- sleep here?" exclaimed gentleman; "exposed wretched she would, without fire, severity winter?" Bob attempted speak, stopped his cough. Billy, times talkative ready reply, answered, "Yes, lives here, sleeps too, cold do not keep us awake!" "And one ever come visit you?" "No one rats!" replied child. "The rats!" exclaimed Neddy, gesture horror disgust, irritated vanity little. Oddity none, he looked tranquil usual. "Oh, papa!" cried Neddy, "they must stay here; horrible hole fit rats!" His father bending Bob, feeling his wrist, asking questions regarding his health, gentle kindness goes farther win confidence affection cold bestowal greatest benefits. "You well; must cared for, boy. I think I could manage get hospital; would every comfort there." "Please, sir," began Bob, stopped; he looked his brother, raised his earnest eyes face his new friend, gathering courage kind glance he met, faltered forth, "Please, sir, would take Billy too?" The gentleman shook his head. "Then-- please, sir, I would much rather stay here: han't never parted, Billy me." I saw Neddy eagerly draw his father aside, near hiding-place behind canvass, I could hear his words, though spoken whisper. "Could get lodging?-- see here!" He pulled something his pocket, spoke still lower; I caught sentence there: "My Christmas-box, aunt gave me, would enough?" his voice earnest indeed. I saw something reminded sunshine steal father's face he looked his blue-eyed boy. Then he replied quiet tone, "Yes, enough provide one till warmer weather comes. I would see food needful comforts wanting." "And, papa, I old suit clothes; poor boy dying cold;-- see, his jacket hardly hold together. Might I give old suit, papa?" I read assent gentleman's smile; then, turning poor motherless children, he told he could leave one night longer miserable place; he would take dwelling honest widow he knew, would watch sick, take care young, she herself mother. Poor Bob, weakened exhausted poor living, looked bewildered words, though he scarcely understood them, ready, without question hesitation, go wherever his benefactor guide him. One doubt seemed linger his mind. "Shall I," said he, hesitating tone, "shall I still able go school?-- I should not like a-leaving now!" "Assuredly shall attend it, boy, soon health permit. I means permanently assisting you; stay England short; I give help time. But school learn help yourself, soon, I hope, independent human aid. I injury, kindness, I teach rest others means living brave honest boy desires earn himself. Now let us go comfortable lodging I mentioned." Billy uttered exclamation childish delight, though word called his mind's eye warm hearth, blazing fire, smoking viands table beside him. They quitted place, Neddy appearing possible happy delighted little child. But Billy last leave she would, he passed many days suffering want. He lingered moment door, looked back pensive expression. "You never wish see place again, I sure?" cried Neddy. "No, place; but-- I ha' liked last peep pretty spotted rat used lead old blind un stick!" CHAPTER XII. A NEW ROAD TO FAME. It may fancy,-- probably so,-- seemed Oddity felt good deal departure his little human friend. I thought he missed lame child taken pleasure watching him, found beauties even his ungainly figure piebald skin. It certainly he needed crumbs half-starved little Billy stinted throw him; I suppose possible even rats grow attached show confidence kindness. I often rallied poor Oddity upon his melancholy boys taken away. Bright-eyes told he ought cat, sit purring mat fire, lick hand old maiden lady, would feed porridge milk. I said he kept gentleman's house, bell round his neck, rats sometimes Germany, frighten brethren away. Oddity took taunts quietly, nibbled his dinner warehouse, spent his time she would; where, he snuffed along ground, fumbled amongst chipping straw, used say he searching little lame Billy, he never would see more. Winter length passed away. Down roof she would, hole it, ran little streams water melted snow. The west wind blew softly, bending columns smoke tall chimneys shore, black funnels steamers went snorting puffing river. On one first mild days found poor old Furry dead warehouse. Life long burden him, his unhappy temper rendered yet galling. I heard rats Newfoundland bury comrades die, laying bodies neatly one beside another, head heels placed alternately together. I know whether true: custom rats England. We therefore left old Furry he lay, close behind barrel salt meat, he discovered next day one men warehouse. Now, one thing men usually think worthless lumber another, body dead rat. Our skins England collected valued France; thought usually get rid unpleasant presence dead creature. And yet, strange say, porter throw away body poor old Furry: he carried his master. I curious indeed know fate; and, many fruitless inquiries, length I discovered it. The tooth Furry's torment life, destined make famous death. Learned men-- I know many-- examined head rat, looked, wondered, consulted together; end matter was, placed great curiosity building called museum. There, amidst fine vases ancient weapons, old manuscripts precious stones, noble busts wise great, head poor old Furry preserved, mouth wide open, display extraordinary tooth! Fame strange thing, all. I believe friend rat first, last, pay heavy price bubble! Early spring, one sunny morn, I received visit old comrade Whiskerandos. He full life spirits. "Ratto," cried he, "I often heard say I visit foreign countries together; we have capital opportunity now. A vessel weigh anchor to-morrow. I talking ship-rat acquaintance, intends sail her, he done before. He says she capital old vessel, full first-rate accommodation rats; Captain Blake keeps good table; never scarcity pickings; and, short, I St. Petersburg, mean embark to-night: say go me." "I am rat!" I exclaimed, highly delighted. "Would room Oddity too?" "I daresay plenty room; but-- well, well, Oddity's excellent old fellow spite his ugly skin; I will take care nobody insults him." Off I scampered Oddity, half breath excitement; giving news I received, I begged accompany Whiskerandos pleasure excursion Russia. The piebald one bluntly declined. "Now nonsense, Oddity," cried I; "you must stay moping longer, pining child, watching his return, he never likely come back." "I know he come back!" sighed Oddity. "Then do not come shake silly gloom? To tell plain truth, Oddity, mind really requires opening, nothing like travelling that. You are, I afraid, well-informed quadruped. I insist upon embarking us to-night, we will make rat you, good fellow!" Oddity shook his head. "What! resolved travel?" "Not water," his short reply. "He going country me," cried Bright-eyes, springing light bounds side. "We are going birth-place, near sea-side. We feast amongst young corn there; pea-blossom faded, ripe pods hang temptingly down, we will climb stalks she will them, banquet sweet green seeds! We will revel strawberry beds, try peach ripest! Oh! merry lives lead rats kitchen-garden, beneath bright sun summer!" "I have half mind go myself," said I, charmed rural description. But I remembered engagement Whiskerandos, repressed rising longing feast upon English fruits, whose names sounded tempting. "Then farewell, Oddity," cried I; "I fear I shall never meet again." "I will come back old she would winter," said he. "But I-- ah! shall I then? How I know, crossing sea, whether I shall ever able return?" I faintest idea Russia might be, sort place I find it; whether rats black, brown, white, fierce Hamster, gentle Zibethicus. A feeling misgiving came suddenly me; one fear others depressed heart, unconsciously I uttered aloud: "I wonder whether Russia rats find plenty eat!" The snub face Oddity grew grave question he could answer, whose importance he felt. But light-hearted Bright-eyes quickly relieved apprehensions. "If judge Russia comes it," he cried, "I say little fear. I examined cargo Russian ship once, never I see finer collection everything could charm rat. I say nothing furs,-- skins kinds creatures, sables, black white foxes, ermines, lynxes, hyænas, bears, panthers, wolves, martens, white hares--" "Stop, stop!" I exclaimed, "we want furs beyond nature adorned us." "There copper, iron, talc, (a mineral resembling glass--)" "We do not care them; rat ever lived upon minerals." "Linen, flax, hemp, feathers--" "If nothing nutritious Russia, I would rather stay home," cried I, little vexation. "What say, then, oil, linseed train-oil? delicious honey, corn without end, soap, isinglass, and, crown whole, hogsheads upon hogsheads of-- tallow!" "Enough, enough!" I exclaimed delight, "Russia country me." CHAPTER XIII. HOW I SET OUT ON MY VOYAGE. When passengers Nautilus went board, bright sun glittering water, whole river full life, covered vessels kinds,-- light boat, lugger, steamer, her gaily-coloured paddle-boxes long dark stream smoke; heavy coal-barge, scarcely moving all, sunk almost level water: sounds sorts, vessels shore-- puffing steam, dipping oars, creaking rigging, ringing bells, shouts calls, sailors' musical "yo, heave, yo!" But went board hours before, comparatively quiet, though great pulse life London never quite ceases heard, even middle night. When crept edge shore, yellow lamps gleaming around, quiet stars twinkling above, young moon looking her image dimly reflected river. "Where vessel?" whispered I Whiskerandos. "Yonder; do not see her black hull?" "But get her?" said I. nervously; "I great mind swim." "Do mark dark line cuts sky? That rope fastens her shore. We make way easily along that." I tolerably intimate acquaintance ropes, feat difficult one rat; yet-- shall I confess it?-- heart quaked little I followed leader across trembling suspension bridge. I was, however, always unwilling show fear presence Whiskerandos, I concealed even relief I felt I reached vessel without ducking. It indeed delightful home rats, many race thought so, number us board certainly trebled sailors. The majority brethren vessel ship rats, whose appearance much resembled terms friendship established us. The brown rats kept together quite separate part ship,-- wise precaution avoid quarrels fights must otherwise constantly ensued. I consequently saw less Whiskerandos voyage I otherwise done. I managed establish myself, audacious rat I was, Captain Blake's cabin. I knew spot danger,-- much skill caution would required avoid detection; I employed industriously enlarging small hole, till I secured passage escape case I discovered, also means free communication parts ship. I need describe cabin saying appeared snug little place. It held swinging-cot hammock; I examined great curiosity articles furniture, first opportunity I observing man makes comfortable. Assuredly his wants his requirements simple ours. Early day captain came board his son, he given sundry orders deck, descended cabin. Imagine surprise when, entrance, I recognised old acquaintance Zoological Gardens, blue-eyed boy his father! I instinctively looked, though vain, see followed Billy Bob. Soon afterwards anchor weighed, vessel began move. It strange new sensation. I never experienced motion little feet. Towards evening motion grew stronger. The vessel heaved down, rocked fro; creaking sounds grew louder, mingled constant splashing noise. Neddy, merry active day, deck, cabin, asking questions, examining everything upon he could lay his hands, appeared quite heavy dull. He complained headache, lay his hammock. I thought boy ill. However, he lively ever morning. Our sea life rather one, first excitement starting over. Neddy spent hours every day cabin, poring things I found called books. I could first comprehend why, his eyes fixed pages seemed exactly alike, he sometimes look grave, sometimes merry, sometimes laugh outright, though one talking book. When, however, his father read aloud boy, he read aloud his father, I could imagine amused, though I never could find means book could make heard. I often snuffed round volumes, even touched whiskers, seemed dead clay. It must wonderful talent, possessed man, enables hear voice them. There one large volume particular, Captain Blake called "Shakespeare," he sometimes read extracts his son. I heard say Shakespeare dead two hundred years. Is marvellous his thoughts, preserved leaves paper manner inexplicable rat, survive long,-- he make others laugh weep he laughs weeps more? As may supposed, I took great interest reading ear caught one evening allusion race Shakespeare, "Rats, mice, small deer." We place wondrous volume; made attention, attention rewarded hearing race Mus. One mention surprised puzzled me. The rhyme still rests memory: "But sieve I will thither sail, And like rat without tail, I will do-- I will do-- I will do!" The _do_, course, represents _nibble, nibble, nibble_; rat without tail species I never heard, certainly never met with. When Neddy read his father, different book; he called "History French Revolution." It might history race, seemed rats: democ-rats aristoc-rats; "doubtless," thought I, "tribes peculiar France." Most savage fellows first seemed been-- race tigers cats, still powerful, bloody, destructive. I, like others jump conclusions, understand half hear, made ridiculous mistake. My vanity led over-estimate importance family; conversation Neddy his father undeceived me, made sadder wiser rat. _Neddy._-- "Well, papa, I fancy shall great deal see St. Petersburg-- palaces, churches, gardens, sorts sights! But I want see czar himself, great autoc-rat Russias." I gave start this, I dreaded moment I betrayed hiding-place. Here another rat, one singular great, he thought worthy seen St. Petersburg besides! I really felt whole frame swelling pride; every hair whiskers quivered! "Is he really powerful, papa, people say he is?" "Very powerful indeed, boy." "And he is despotic, he not? He Parliament?" "No Parliament!" I repeated myself; "well, that is great matter country abounding good things! But rat rats must be, spoken thought lords creation!" "It must fine thing autoc-rat, papa, law one's will!" "It giddy elevation, Neddy, truly wise man, conscious human infirmity, would ever covet attain." "Wise man! human infirmity!" exclaimed I. These words, like touch bubble, burst high-blown ideas family dignity. It man, then, one human race, chose add rat his name; democ-rats aristoc-rats France-- why, must men too, nothing men, all! CHAPTER XIV. A TERRIBLE WORD. When I met old friend Whiskerandos, usually night, moving day dangerous; ever showed mercy rat, even thought inquiring whether he possessed qualities might render deserving it? "How like quarters?" said Whiskerandos one starry night, still upon deck, and, save one sailor watch, humankind sleeping. "They please well enough," I replied. "For part," said Whiskerandos, "I shall heartily glad voyage over; I half vexed I ever led make it." "Why so? We fare ill; plenty eat." As I mentioned before, ever first consideration rat. "The sailors do not starve," said Whiskerandos slowly; "yet think adding another dish mess." "Glad hear it," said I; "you know I curious dishes, like whiskers new one." "Oh! will not contented whiskers!" cried friend, funny, forced laugh. "What mean?" said I quickly. "Well, I heard Jack Tom, two sailors, talking together to-day hold; one word conversation which, I own, struck like paw cat. That word was--" "What it?" cried I nervously; hero like Whiskerandos felt anything approaching fear, I might expected half-dead fright. He drooped his head moment, uttered one word-- "_rat-pies!_" I started though I seen tabby pounce rigging! "It Is impossible!" I faintly exclaimed; "human beings never, never eat rats!" "Oh! I beg pardon!" replied Whiskerandos, regaining his usual brisk manner; "do not remember old Furry telling us his reason quitting China was, he afraid dished dinner mighty mandarin, whose hair hung long tail behind him? Amongst lowest classes France, gypsies England, poor rats known article food; I heard islands South Seas held much esteem, 'sweet rat' passed proverb." "I do not like compliments!" exclaimed I, beginning tremble over. "Come, Ratto, must pluck little courage, show worthy race Mus! There never use meeting misfortune half way. To caught, killed, put pie, is, I grant it, serious evil; always afraid another. The first may may escape; second-- perhaps worse two-- lies degree within power will. We need make wretched time, event never may happen." Good philosophy this, I believe, little difficult act upon. When I seen younger members race proudly styles "lords creation," trembling, shrinking, nay-- I shame say it-- even _crying_, fear possible evil, little disappointment perhaps, little pain, I thought Whiskerandos pies, fancied reasoning mortals might learn something even rat. I terribly afraid caught sailors, I confined usual cabin, keeping close hole I made, I might always ready start blue eyes ever happen rest upon me; books, famous books, happily gave occupation. "Papa," said Neddy his father one day, "I rather gone place St. Petersburg, I feel dislike Russians." "Why dislike them," said captain. "Oh! enemies long, killed many fine fellows!" "They obeying orders czar-- believed duty." "But horribly cruel, papa." "It would ungenerous unjust charge upon whole nation crimes individuals. It singular one striking examples mercy foe I ever heard, shown Russian. The story given fact, I pleasure relating it, touching interest, hope may teach son conduct towards who, though foes, fellow-creatures still. "In time first Napoleon, French invaded Russia, whence obliged retreat, suffering fearful hardships, usual privations war, caused famine fearful cold northern clime. Thousands thousands brave troops perished fatal retreat. The splendid army marched Russia numerous strong, melted away like snow-ball! The fierce Cossacks hovered around lessening bands, cutting weary stragglers who, unable keep rest, sank upon snow die! "At fearful time two poor French officers, separated comrades, helpless exhausted, sought refuge house lady, beseeching her preserve terrible death threatened, either cold hunger, swords enemies. The lady Russian,-- officers her foes,-- she probably suffered devastating march French army,-- she heart woman. She dared conceal officers her house fear her servants rage her countrymen, would probably slain fugitives, wreaked vengeance also upon her seeking protect enemies. The Russian lady hid wood, little distance her dwelling, thither every night, braving danger discovery peril attacked wolves, noble-hearted woman go alone, bear food necessaries suffering Frenchmen." "Oh! papa, fancy hurrying along snow, sharp winter's wind cutting like knife,-- perhaps hear distant howl, showing wolf one's track! Oh! I fancied night expeditions!" "It would noble," resumed captain, "to ventured thus friend,-- Russian lady her enemies." "And French officers saved last?" "Yes; freely giving her money she freely risked her safety, lady contrived escape fugitives beyond frontier. When considerable time elapsed, present piece plate, she received France, showed officers ungrateful preserver." "She generous enemy, papa, noble woman. But common people Russia ignorant bad?" "Very ignorant I believe are, would harsh wrong call bad. They cheerful good-tempered, even intoxicated show ferocity disgraces drunkard England." "But dreadful thieves?" "They said skilful cheating, singularly dexterous picking pockets. But would unjust brand whole nation disgraceful stigma.* I another true story you, Neddy, time shall poor Russian, messenger, call him, Isdavoi. "An English lady living St. Petersburg gave five hundred rubles** charge Isdavoi deliver her daughter, dwelt distance. On following day Russian returned, kissed lady's hand fashion his country, said, 'Pardon me, I guilty. I cannot tell happened, I lost money, cannot find again. Deal please.'" "The poor fellow," continued captain, "probably expected severe flogging, dismissal his office, lady inclination punish rigour. Unwilling ruin Isdavoi, she made mention his offence, considered money gone ever, lost sight messenger entirely. After six years elapsed he came her one day joyful face, laden six hundred rubles, he brought place intrusted his care. On inquiry found honest Russian six years denying every little pleasure, resolute economy saved his wages he collected half sum required. He married wife whose feelings honour appeared delicate his own, her dower one hundred rubles added his hard-earned savings, her little valuables sold make full amount money lost!" "Oh, papa! honest people! But English woman take money!" "No entreaties her part could induce poor Isdavoi take back rubles save long object his life. The lady, however, generously placed money public bank accumulate benefit his children." "Bravo!" exclaimed Neddy, clapping his hands; "that lady behave; poor Isda-- call him?-- he fine fellow, quite worthy Englishman!" [* The materials little sketch Russian manners, &c., chiefly drawn translation work German traveller Kohl.] [** A Russian piece money.] CHAPTER XV. FIRST VIEW OF ST. PETERSBURG. "Cronstadt! Cronstadt!" I heard shout deck one evening sun going down, his red disk seemed resting heaving waters, east strong fortifications stood clearly defined sky, bathed his glowing light. Being quite alone cabin, every human deck, I taking survey place open port-hole me. It gay scene upon I looked. Not even Thames, river, I seen greater variety craft. Steam-boats, sailing-boats, schooners, cutters, brigs gondolas,-- paddled along water, spread snowy wings breeze. I gazed upon them, upon formidable batteries, bristling guns, defend "water-gate St. Petersburg" Cronstadt called, till shadows night fell around, I could without risk observation, join Whiskerandos hold. He company another rat, rather foreign appearance. "My friend Dwishtswatshiksky here," said he, "tells shall soon arrive capital Russia." "I glad hear it!" cried I; "I long shore. If means landing here, I care I stopped short St. Petersburg." I forgotten pies. "You would doubtless, little brother, natural association, like visit Rat Island," said stranger unpronounceable name. "Rat Island!" exclaimed Whiskerandos I moment. "That fortified island opposite Cronstadt, lying across bay upon place stands, giving waters appearance lake, called Ratusare, Rat's Island days old." "Not Rat's Island world," observed Whiskerandos; "we one coast Devon." "And doubtless still bears name," said Russian rat, graceful wave his whiskers. "But things, alas! altered warriors Peter Great drove Swedes island 1703. The vanquished left behind nothing great kettle, default trophy Russians reared triumph pole; name place changed since time, Rat Island called Kettle Island." "It fortunate us, sir rat," said I, (I venture attempt call his name,) "it fortunate us landing strange country, met friend intelligent well-informed appear be." He made many polite assurances gratification he felt making acquaintance, pleasure would give conduct us house he usually quartered city, pride he would feel showing us everything he could hope would interest us, blunt English rats felt almost abashed his excessive courtesy. He followed manners his country, poorest labourer quite overwhelming his politeness. Dwishtswatshiksky (we soon shortened his name Wisky) good his word. We kept close passengers landed magnificent quay St. Petersburg; rapid tread feet, loud voices, shouts hurried movements, heard above, rat ventured forth his hiding-place. Alas! every precaution, mustered landing, numbers sadly diminished, though rat pies heard more. In darkness second time made suspension bridge rope bound vessel shore, delight I found upon land, free denizen earth, longer cooped narrow, dangerous prison vessel. Wisky led way, closely followed Whiskerandos. They moved fast I danger losing sight guides, apt I linger way look wonders around me. It beautiful city, St. Petersburg; least seemed moonlight. With streets palaces, lively green roofs, sky-blue cupolas dotted stars, gilt spires, columns, statues, obelisks, place soon forgotten. If I might venture suggest fault, looks perfectly new. Antiquity gives added interest beauty,-- least opinion rat. That looks risen yesterday, appears though might fall to-morrow. "Would believe it," said Wisky, "a great part splendid city built upon piles! The foundation alone yonder great church cost million rubles! There constant fight going water efforts man. To look fine buildings around us, would say man secured victory. He thrown river variety bridges, stone, suspension, pontoon, taken pieces pleasure, connect numerous islands together, raised stately edifices trembling bog! But water conquered all! I known houses burst asunder foundations giving way. I seen palace separated steps led door. And spring, snow melts collecting months, horses scarcely flounder along rivers mud streets!" "Does water ever rise high?" inquired Whiskerandos. This idle question his part; he made practical rat, knew live cellar, desire drowned. "Ah, dear brother!" replied Russian rat, "many stories still told fearful inundation happened 1824. Impelled furious west wind, waters rose fearful height, streamed streets, floated carriages, made boats carts, nay, lifted wooden houses right ground, sent floating about, inhabitants them, like many men-of-war! Horses drowned, so, alas! rats terrible numbers. The trees squares crowded men, clinging like bees cluster! It said thousands poor human beings perished, inundation cost city hundred millions rubles!" "Well, St. Petersburg splendid place!" cried I; "but all, merry banks Thames, dear dingy old London me!" CHAPTER XVI. A RUSSIAN KITCHEN. Under guidance Wisky took abode Russian house. House I call it!-- ever palace one. We established kitchen; warm, comfortable place found it, much opportunity observation, denizens place various occupations. "It seems me, Wisky," said I, night following arrival, "that end number servants pass dwelling! Who fellow blue cloth caftan, fastened his left arm three silver buttons, girded round waist coloured silk scarf? His fine bushy beard seems match fur his high four-cornered cap trimmed." "That Tartar coachman," replied Wisky; "a dashing fellow he, bold driver crowded streets city. The pretty youths yonder postilions. Young small must be, suit taste Russian noble. The worse them, poor boys, less able endure bitter cold winter's night, when, drop asleep horses, never likely awake more!" "And masters actually cruel enough," I exclaimed, "to expose suffering risk?" "My much esteemed brother," replied Russian rat, "doubtless clear mind already come conclusion selfishness inherent human race. A young noble ball; must he quit bright enchantments, society fair he admires, bearded coachman freezing without? A beauteous lady, wrapped ermine velvet, weeping theatre woes imaginary heroine; would her dry her tearful eyes, leave scene touching interest elegant excitement, icicles hanging locks her little postilion, his head gradually sinking his breast, fatal sleep steals him? Selfish!-- yes, human beings selfish!" "There exceptions rule," thought I, I remembered stories I heard cabin; I also recollected conduct narrator, Captain Blake, towards starving little thief London. "I trying," said Whiskerandos, "to count servants house; sooner I think task done, comes new one, speaking different language, wearing different costume, puts calculations fault." "It would puzzle even one possessing talents brother count number servants here," replied Wisky. "Why, even I, who, visit England, spent months amongst household, scarcely number now. To begin inmates higher rank, never appear kitchen, French governess German tutor, polish minds children, family physician look health. Then superintendent accounts, secretary, dworezki-- he charge whole establishment, valets lord, valets lady, overseer children, footmen, buffetshik butler, table-decker, head groom, coachman postilions lord, coachman postilions lady,--" "What!" cried Whiskerandos, "are carriages small hold two, grandees afraid quarrelling, husband wife cannot travel together!" "Surely, Sir Wisky," exclaimed I, "you must come end list!" "Pardon me, little brother, yet. There attendants boys tutor, porter, head cook cook, baker, brewer, waiting-maids wardrobe-keeper lady, waiting-maid attends French governess, nurses take care children, nurses took care children, kapell-meister head musician, men his band!" "Well!" cried I, much amused, "at rate Russian noble must well served. If he calls his shoes, I suppose half-a-dozen servants start race fetch them, knock heads together eagerness get them!" A valet moment entered kitchen, where, secure hiding-place, watching passed. "Where is Ivan?" said he, "where is Ivan?" The coachman, playing draughts head groom, looked instant, silently made his move. "My lady's a-fainting, lord's calling water! Where is Ivan, I say? it is his business fetch it." "There is Ivan," said cook, pointing contemptuously sandy-haired figure fast asleep table. "Get up, ye lazy fellow!" exclaimed valet; "my lady's fainting, lord's calling water; take glass silver salver directly." Ivan got slowly, yawned, stretched himself, rubbed his eyes; then, taking tumbler dresser, he leisurely filled water. "And I get silver salver?" said he. "That is keeping Matwei buffetshik," observed table-decker. "And Matwei found?" "Here you, Vatka," pursued valet, turning another attendant, busy his basin kwas, "go Matwei tell want silver salver carry tumbler, lady's fainting stairs, lord calling water." A loud ring heard, enforce order. "Sei tshas! sei tshas!-- directly, directly!" called Vatka; he nevertheless finished his kwas, wiped his mouth he went Matwei butler procure silver salver Ivan footman would carry tumbler water Paul valet ordered bring. Before ready another messenger came tell Ilia bearded coachman put horses, lady ready her drive. It evident she managed recover her fainting fit without aid glass water,-- happy thing one misfortune keep fifty sixty servants. Wisky laughed look surprise. "I believe one pair hands," said he, "often serve better dozen. The Russian proverb says 'directly' means _to-morrow morning_, 'this minute' _this day week_." With quiet night came feasting-time, kitchen deserted crowds servants, Whiskerandos, Wisky, I, crept softly hole, provided pretty sharp appetites meal. "I curious taste liquor call kwas," said I; "Vatka seemed relish exceedingly." "Relish it, brother! I think so!" exclaimed Wisky. "Kwas Russian water fish; rich poor could hardly bear existence without it." "Not bad all," said I, dipping whiskers carefully bowl set aside cook. "Mind do not tumble in, old fellow!" cried Whiskerandos, "and drowned kwas I heard duke drowned wine." "And may kwas made of?" inquired I, another approving sip. "I ought know, little brother," replied Wisky, "for many many time I seen brewed. A pailful water poured earthen jar, shaken two pounds barley-meal, half pound salt, pound half honey. The whole placed oven moderate fire, constantly stirred. It left time settle, morning clear liquor poured off. In week highest perfection." "I wonder kwas made England," observed I; "but honey plentiful there." "Sugar would make good substitute, I think," said Wisky; "the beverage would expensive one. But beloved Whiskerandos busy his shtshee, dish dishes country, nothing, I believe, could ever drive table heart Russian. When foreign land, said, remembrance native hills plains, tender delights home, draws tears exile's eyes, loss his beloved shtshee, favourite dish his childhood." "Leave little me!" I cried eagerly Whiskerandos, nearly finished, dint steady perseverance, portion left plate. "Why," I added, I tasted liquid, "this seems simply cabbage soup!" "Whatever brother may think it," observed Wisky, dipping his whiskers nearly empty plate, "he tasting forms principal article food forty millions human beings! Better live without bread without shtshee." "And ingredients?" said I, I always delighted pick scrap information interesting rat. "There almost many ways making shtshee cooking potatoes. I seen six seven cabbages chopped small, half pound butter, handful salt, two pounds minced mutton added, whole mixed two kwas. But time, brothers, us sally forth. I must honours city, show illustrious guests whatever I may deem worthy observation." CHAPTER XVII. A RAMBLE OVER ST. PETERSBURG. "What nation painters Russia must be!" exclaimed I, quietly moved silent streets. Every shop picture it, expressive occupation owner. Here tempting board covered representations every loaf roll painter's fancy could devise; tallow-chandler his best make candles appear picturesque. Even second third floors hung portraits fiddles, flutes, boots, shoes, caps, bonnets, bears' grease, one board sad likeness rat trap made us quicken steps passed it. We moved deserted market. Here whole lanes devoted sale single kind article. There stocking row, shoe row, hat row, appeared whole nation might provided covering head feet. "I wish, dear brother," said Wisky, "that visit season winter. I could led market strangers must indeed surveyed surprise. You would seen beasts, fishes, fowls, frozen hard hatchet required divide them. You would passed rows dead sheep standing upon feet, motionless oxen seemed ready low, whole flocks white hares appearing actually motion, reindeer elks whose mighty horns pigeons fearlessly perch!" "The cold must fearful winter," said I. "Oh! houses kept warm stoves little suffering known. But woe men loiter streets paved ice glistening snow! The passengers run lives, sharp wind rushing them, cat mouse! Men cover even faces fur; unlucky nose peep warm shelter, bitter frost often bites sudden. "Father-- father! thy nose!" thus one stranger salute another he passes; speedily rubbed snow, nose poor passenger lost! Men's eyes sometimes frozen up, resource beg admission first door grope, unthaw glued lashes stove!" "All curious," observed I, "but still I little desire witness it. The long winter must dreary indeed!" "The Russians lively fellows," observed Wisky, "and instead grumbling dark skies piercing blasts, make merry others would murmur. When winter must perforce companion, oblige grim old giant add amusements. You see gay sledges dash full speed frozen surface River Neva! ice-mountains people raise, glide swift lightning, laughing, shouting, singing! I seen snow piled roof house; steep slope, merely seated mat, large merry party glide gaily ground. But," he cried, suddenly interrupting himself, "have care tread, brother, ice-pit! Never place St. Petersburg these,-- large house deemed complete without one. If Russians _cannot_ without abundance ice winter, show _will_ without brief hot summer,-- quantities consumed could scarcely believed!" Whiskerandos, lingering behind us, tempting quarter market, scampered joined us. We passing time large building, I could avoid looking wonder strange columns. Of fewer hundred, capital formed three cannon, round open mouths yawning street. "This," said guide, following direction eyes, "is Spass Preobrashenskoi Sabor; church greatly adorned spoils nations vanquished Russia." "Well," said Whiskerandos, course his adventurous life seen cannon learnt use, "perhaps big instruments war well there, seen, heard felt. Man creature, I fancy, who, content powers destruction nature given him, cuts trees forest, digs iron mine, sets furnace glowing, engine working, fashion means killing his brothers wholesale manner." "Yonder," said Wisky, pointing his nose, "are father Russian fleet grandmother houses St. Petersburg." "Let us see means!" I exclaimed; "I viewed plenty Russian ships Russian houses, I lively curiosity see father grandmother famous family!" Wisky rapidly led way hut, little difficulty entered, locks bars keep rats, surly porters refuse admission. "Is father Russian fleet!" exclaimed Whiskerandos rather contemptuously, running, audacious rat he was, along edge boat thirty feet long. "Is Russia child, she amuse herself toy, keep big boat roof water float it, delicate jewel!" "On jewel Emperor's crown," replied Wisky, "would Russian look interest poor boat. Peter Great helped fashion himself! He found his country without navy, he gave her one; he laboured common ship-wright: now, mighty oak springs single acorn, one boat his people view reverence "The father Russian fleet." "And grandmother houses?" inquired I. "That hard by," replied Wisky. "It nothing small wooden cottage Peter built Neva, single street stretched across dreary bog upon he founded city palaces!" And rambled on, light-hearted rats were, picking scraps there, exchanging observations, till faint blush eastern sky warned us time go home. Before reached house already criers abroad streets, screaming, "Boots Casan!"-- "Pictures Moscow!"-- "Flowers, fine flowers!" wandered on, carrying wares heads. Fierce-looking fellows, long shaggy hair beards, wrapped skins passing about, exchanging good-natured greetings, strangely contrast appearance. "Good-day, brother! goes it? pleasure? I serve you?" Smiling, bowing, baring rough heads other, poor Russians appeared pictures politeness shrouded sheepskin. But remembering even amongst civilized nations world, rats considered quite beyond pale courtesy, good-natured Musjik city would thought nothing hitting one us his shoe, thought better retreat skins whole, regain comfortable quarters kitchen. CHAPTER XVIII. HOW WE WERE TRANSPORTED. It intention, well Whiskerandos, hearing cheerfulness Russian winter, comfort preserved houses, remain witness ice-mountains, frozen Neva, and, all, wonderful market Wisky described us night. Our intentions, however, frustrated, projects amusement defeated incident suddenly altered whole course affairs. Whiskerandos, bold independent disposition, cared place constantly guidance his Russian companion. He made forays streets, moon moon, one him. He brought us back accounts many singular adventures,-- he seen dog, chased cat, nearly run drosky, name given vehicles St. Petersburg take place London cabs. "Have care, brother, care! Even brave may dare much, fortunate venture often!" exclamations courteous Russian rat would listen tales hair-breadth escapes. The effect his words upon render cautious,-- timid perhaps call it. The motives usually roused encounter danger, hunger, overpowering curiosity. I liked see all, hear all, know all, picked scraps general information relish I would picked scraps cheese. Once Whiskerandos came home high spirits. He made discovery, found treasures,-- place others rat might rejoice boundless content. Directly behind Exchange he found large open space, fenced round iron railing, which, keeping man, offered everywhere door welcome rats. Here, protected nothing tarpaulin, collected quantity goods, imported Russia, she paid back her productions contributions world. "Oh, mountains tallow I saw there!" exclaimed Whiskerandos, executing somerset air, excess his admiration delight. "There may well mountains, brother," observed Wisky, "since, besides quantities she uses herself, Russia said export every year _two hundred fifty millions pounds_ tallow, one half shipped St. Petersburg." "Two hundred fifty millions!" I exclaimed, almost breathless amazement, "why, surely enough light whole world, feast every rat it! I would give anything see place glorious mountains found?" "Trust to-morrow night, I guide place," said Whiskerandos. Now commenced conflict mind, caution pulling one way, curiosity other, discussion took place comrades, Wisky backing caution, Whiskerandos curiosity,-- English rat day. So night two scampered together, without accident adventure reached space back Exchange. Truly I world wonders! I actually revelled everything charm palate nose rat! Here division Russian imports,-- various curious they. There chests tea China, coffee Arabia, sugar West Indies, English cotton goods, bales bales piled marvellous height. There quantity tobacco, heaps cheese, spices sorts kinds. Now came upon odour cinnamon cloves; strong perfume musk betrayed importation India. No wonder hours passed unheeded lingered wonderful place! We passed portion area devoted Russian exports, were, possible, still delighted! All articles Bright-eyes mentioned coming Russia here; bewildered amongst heaps furs, piles leather, barrels tallow, prodigious quantities corn! Morn breaking, indeed, could tear away, till sounds life, signs motion around us, alarmed idea late retreat. "Let us bury corn-sack," cried I, "we sleep well day, recommence explorations dark." Whiskerandos acceded proposition. Quiet kept, quiet. Noisier world seemed grow, till length voices heard alarmingly near, I crouched closer companion terror! Then-- oh! horrible sensation I experienced,-- never shall I forget it! I felt sack roughly pushed one, suddenly lifted high! "We lost!" I gasped Whiskerandos. Then another sort motion succeeded, accompanied heavy rumbling sound, like rolling wheel truck. Every hair mine quivered fear! "Whiskerandos! oh, Whiskerandos! carrying us mill!-- ground powder two great stones!" "Be quiet never despair," answer bold-hearted rat. I believe terrible journey last long, time appeared age! Every turn grating wheel beneath sent pang anguish frame! At last truck, were, stopped; minutes sack rudely moved, carried aloft, tumbled, living contents, down-- down-- could tell where! What shock gave me, tumble! I lay seconds quite stunned. My first impulse, I recovered little, bitterly bewail condition, reproach brought it. "Oh I content kwas shtshee! Oh I never left kitchen! I never ventured forth reckless companion, would, I believe, play hide seek cat, nibble pocket rat-catcher!" My tone was, I knew, peevish provoking; many brown rat, position companion, would stopped doleful squeaking giving something squeak for. But Whiskerandos, whatever his faults, mean one quarrelling found out, attempting screen defend them. "Ratto, I sorry I led trouble," said he. "I wish I could suffer alone self-will imprudence. But since regrets recall past, let us make miseries greater reproaches dissension may soon die, lived, together." His mildness quite overcame feeling bitterness heart; hope revived time elapsed without fresh alarm occurring. "I wonder are!" exclaimed I, shaking easy position. "I fancy I hear creaking windlass!" cried Whiskerandos. "And flapping canvass!" added I. "And I smell tar." "A strong odour tar! Depend upon it, hold ship!" "Ha! that is ripple water! she moves,-- she moves!" We afloat waters! CHAPTER XIX. A STORM AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. "Farewell St. Petersburg, stately city! thy flat green roofs, star-spangled domes! Farewell merry-hearted, sandy-haired Russians, bearded Tartars, gay Circassians,-- never may behold again! Farewell kwas shtshee, luxuries brief time enjoyed! Where going now,-- where!" Such complaints I will not pour long tedious voyage succeeded. Whiskerandos never grumbled, his nature; he quietly fed his corn without uttering one melancholy word: I suspected he, like myself, associated sailors rat pies; hear one approach hold, drove almost wild terror. That horrible voyage! A fearful tempest came vessel readied place her destination, whatever might be. The winds whistled raged, ship reeled plunged like restive horse; torrents salt water came sweeping hold! Then, furious storm continued, seams ship seemed open like pores, let sea, knocking raging without admittance, till length hold became like ditch, rats could cross swimming! Then pumps set work-- I could hear men toiling day night; yet water gained notwithstanding efforts. There tremendous noises deck; I fancied twice I could distinguish human cries; constant splashing water vessel rolled heavily side side, bumping thumping casks got loose, smashing one another, shouting, roaring wind waves, enough stun terrify creature, he quadruped biped! Such corn remained sack becoming soft salt water acquired consistence pudding. But heart even eat! We often heard captain's voice raised give loud orders, ceased pay particular attention them, little dreaming would concern us regarded safety vessel. But length result order lighten ship speedily felt hold! Our sack (for still made hiding-place) suddenly lifted others; time even guess intended, splash went sea! Ugh! water bubbled ears! What frantic efforts made free sack! Nor efforts without success, long ago gnawed string fastened mouth: opened motion waves, corn, rats all, floated upon surface raging billows! Down two seconds went corn, swallowed sea; still struggled, drowning rats were, save desperate swimming. Of course strength must soon exhausted, mighty green waves must swept us destruction, barrel, thrown ship, happily floating near us! Whiskerandos saw little island hope. As me, I much frightened confused look around me; I instinctively followed he led, soon found myself, shivering, shaking, dripping wet, looking wretched rat look, floating barrel beside friend! How shook glistening sides, shuddered gazed disconsolately round us wide waste waters, lashed long streaks angry foam! Alas! land sight; white mist rested horizon, shut distant view. "If drowned shall starved!" exclaimed I, piteously, Whiskerandos. Alas! barrel empty. Oh! misery endured day, terrible night succeeded! We resource gnaw tasteless wood. We surrounded water, yet perishing thirst! pinched hunger, without hope relief! Better drowned once; better fallen paw mouser, caught like brothers trap, dying thus inches barrel, tossed midst sea! But gray morning hope dawned! We perceived little island drifted near shore. The waves much quiet, leapt beach pleasant murmur, strove roll on, farther other, like children merrily racing together. "Could swim shore?" said Whiskerandos. But I recoiled dangerous attempt. "No, no; wave roll barrel beach," I replied; "no struggling water me!" And waves, bearing barrel green backs, seemed often ready land safely shore, time changed minds, kept bobbing down, retired back grating noise pebbles, mocking distress impatience. "We farther ten minutes ago," said Whiskerandos. "Perhaps tide turn. Pluck brave heart, let us dash like rats!" he plunged fearlessly water. But sharp spur hunger, I fear I left make bold attempt alone; but, famished I was, I resolved swim life. With sudden effort I sprang waves; so, following wake companion, I struggled safety shore! Oh! delight feeling dry ground again!-- standing firm, solid earth! Never, never again, I firmly resolved, would I venture vessel, trust life mercy billows nearly accomplished destruction. CHAPTER XX. CATCH HIM-- DEAD OR ALIVE! We made hasty breakfast star-fish found stranded beach; rather increased painful thirst, find means quenching hurried inland utmost speed weakened powers could command. We run far came large house. "There sure supply water here," said Whiskerandos. "Let us explore place." "I fancy I hear dripping!" I cried eagerly, approached door back-yard. The door indeed closed, sharp bits broken bottles, top brick wall, rendered impossible climb them; I-- wit quickened painful thirst-- discovered moment that, bottom door, part wood broken away, either time perhaps teeth brethren, leaving opening large enough rat easily creep through. I one venture unexplored region, I looked anxiously yard. At opposite side was-- oh, joyful sight!-- pump, drop drop fell, inviting sound, trough below. And yet, faint thirst I was, place aspect alarmed me, made fear venture across yard. Not far pump, us, open green door, led garden pleasure-ground, though I could see nothing alarm me, quick ear distinguished suspicious sounds direction. "In you!" exclaimed Whiskerandos, impatiently. "Do not keep here, dying thirst hole." I drew back gesture caution. "Whiskerandos," said I, "I do not like green door open yonder. If one came yard cut retreat!" "Nothing dare, nothing win!" he exclaimed; "I thirsty I must water:" and, hurrying little opening I mentioned, he soon eagerly drinking trough. Hesitating, doubting, I follow him, already nose hole, sight, remembrance I shudder still, made withdraw instanter. Through fatal green door near pump, young man, his hands his pockets his cap cocked one side, followed several dogs, leisurely sauntered yard. I saw instant Whiskerandos escape impossible. He whole length yard cross; his foes far nearer me. His chance perceived; broad daylight, noses three four dogs two yards him, miserable chance indeed. The dogs instantly found out, moment. My unhappy companion darted behind trough, quick flash lightning. I felt assured he would bravely defend last; could one poor rat do, albeit boldest his race, terrible odds! "Ha! rat!" exclaimed young man, looking quite amused pleased-- barbarian he was!-- prospect seeing poor defenceless creature torn pieces him. "Ha! Carlo, give him!-- shake ear!" The young man actually laughed aloud delight! I could see Whiskerandos, trough us: I fancied his look fierce despair he faced foes he could flee, he could expect pity. He evidently got corner, dogs could easily dislodge him; stood yelping barking, showing white teeth, greedy eyes turned one point. So human savage came aid. Having taken stick happened lying ground near, dogs retired step allow master give his ungenerous assistance, he pushed stick behind trough, means dragged poor Whiskerandos his last place refuge! "Ha! fellow's dead! I must killed stick!" cried young man; stooping he lifted poor rat tail, held aloft examine closely, dogs leapt barked around, eager tear victim limb limb! "He is wars-- lost his ears!" laughed young man, still holding stiffened body high tail. "I am sorry I poked stick; he would given us sport dogs!" Did ever heartless monster walk two feet before! "Oh! Whiskerandos! Whiskerandos!" thought I, as, almost rooted spot horror, I stood gazing pitiful sight. "I glad dead! oh, I glad dead! bravest, noblest rats, torture more!" The dogs showed impatient movements considered master took great deal much time his survey lifeless rat I suspect he tease tantalize them, suddenly raising Whiskerandos still higher, give force his fling, he cried, "Now Carlo-- Rover-- Cæsar-- who is first!" swung body away towards door behind I stood trembling, shuddering spectator! But lo behold! sooner seemingly dead rat touch ground, he found life, strength, speed moment! The dogs like wind, force fling given good start, he opening door, knocking he pushed past, almost I could recall scattered senses sufficiently understand he actually alive! I remembrance young man's exclamation amazement dead rat found his feet disappeared,-- his shout, yells disappointed dogs,-- I recollect more, I heard more. Whiskerandos I fair start, made best it, scampered rats scamper lives. Well us door locked!-- well us broken bits bottles top! well us hole small passage thing larger rat! I think pursued: perhaps unlocking door took foe much time, perhaps he think worth hunt ignoble game, perhaps he considered (but I much doubt) cleverness rat shown making extraordinary escape, entitled little indulgence. But ran though whole pack hounds behind us; never paused take breath look behind us, till buried corn-field. "And really unhurt?" I exclaimed, stopped last, panting exhausted. "Unhurt? yes!-- bruised fling,-- well yard paved stones." "And really alive senses savage holding head hanging down! Why, looked like dead rat ever I saw one!" "I wide awake time," said Whiskerandos, "but I knew chance feign death. This narrow escape, Ratto; I never near torn pieces before, even fight ferret!" "I will never go near house daylight again!" exclaimed I, still trembling excitement terror. Whiskerandos appeared feel effects fright less I did, though his danger much greater. "It thirst makes nervous," said he; "you yet recovered voyage barrel. There seems wet ditch around field; come moisten nose water." The relief certainly great, I drank cool liquid, I felt spirits revive. "I wonder now!" said I. "I doubt subject,-- old England again! The look house, hedges, fields, young fellow--" "Oh! do not speak him!" I exclaimed, "cruel, barbarous monster he is!" "You hard him," said Whiskerandos, his frank, good-humoured manner. "He may worse rest his species, think harm cruel rat. I suspect even blue-eyed friend would shout joy see cat worry mouse!" "I do not believe it!" I replied indignantly; "a generous noble heart never take pleasure seeing pain inflicted poor defenceless creature!" "Ah, but--" Whiskerandos commenced, conversation suddenly interrupted little squeak hedge close behind us. "I think I know voice!" exclaimed I, I hardly uttered sentence ere thick covert sprang well-remembered form Bright-eyes! CHAPTER XXI. A NEW KIND OF WATCH-DOG. What rubbing noses ensued! travels perils joy see face friend! I much also relate, (I ever loquacious rat,) I almost lost breath long narration. I wound account description last adventure Whiskerandos, now, eyes, ten times hero before. "And I told news," said I, "let us hear little yours. In first place, old Oddity?" Bright-eyes hung his head, drooped his long tail touching melancholy manner. Such conduct lively rat showed last surviving brother dead! "How happen?" I could say. "Not week arrival parts, he caught hay-rick farmer!" faltered Bright-eyes. "I saw seized neck, I heard his despairing cry; I could stay see poor fellow killed, I afraid sharing his fate, I made fast I could." "Poor Oddity!" sighed I mournfully, "never uglier better-hearted rat! Ah! pleasure I vainly promised relating adventures! I across deep waters, encountered various perils, danger cooked pie, shivering barrel ocean, yet I safe sound all; you, remaining quietly England, ignominiously perished hay-rick!" Whiskerandos, who, brown rat, could expected feel regret myself, turned towards Bright-eyes, asked far London-- "For I long back old quarters," said he. "A fortnight's journey rat, he travel land," replied Bright-eyes: "we came comfortably river boat, carried us within five miles spot." "I enough water time," said Whiskerandos; "and fields full ripe corn, gardens fruit, nothing pleasant journey land! What say you, friend Ratto?" inquired he. "I mind long journey either land sea," replied I melancholy tone; "I will keep company day two, Whiskerandos, I would rather return London. I settle quietly time country near spot poor Oddity died!" "And you?" said Whiskerandos, turning Bright-eyes. The lively rat shook his ears his natural vivacity. "Pardon me," he cried, "but I am Oddity's opinion,-- heroes like Sir Whiskerandos worst travelling companions world! How Ratto escaped his life I cannot imagine, I shall certainly try experiment following fortunes hour! I have fancy baked pie, starved barrel, crushed drosky, worried dog, drowned sack, suspended tail! No, no, valiant Whiskerandos, I am quite content admire courage distance, I do not want share exploits, would rather ears fame!" And skipped merry little rat, could say word stay him. Whiskerandos I, weary enough adventures passed, slept greater part day field, wandered night vain search food. The next day remarkably hot. It season harvest, felt necessity keeping quietly concealed, many men, women also, busily engaged fields. The heat, however, produced thirst, water near could quench it. "I say, Ratto," observed Whiskerandos, "do see yonder object, near sheaf, glitters brightly sun?" "It can," replied I, "doubtless belonging one reapers." "I wonder hunch bread cheese beside it," said Whiskerandos. "I surprised were." Whiskerandos remained minute silence, said, "I want compare English beer Russian kwas." "You going field!" I cried alarm. "I going,-- why, nothing fear; reaper near, were, he would need sharp fellow could catch rat open field!" So daring fellow went his way, I, peeping cautiously side that, make sure human could see us stubble, hurried companion, full curious make acquaintance contents can. There bundle something beside it, tied large red handkerchief, something inviting odour. But scarcely Whiskerandos, foremost, touched reaper's dinner end his whiskers, something jumped suddenly behind bundle, voice rat fiercely exclaimed,-- "Keep off, I will bite you!" Whiskerandos looked surprised unexpected defiance, feelings amazement scarcely conceived I recognised, (could be!) dumpy form, blunt head, piebald skin lost brother Oddity! I rushed forward squeak delight! No doubt, though less eager excited his manner, Oddity also greatly pleased meeting his brother again. He looked, however, suspiciously handkerchief Whiskerandos, desired "keep off," resolution I never dreamed piebald rat capable. "What bundle, guard carefully?" said I, rubbed noses again, every expression affection. "The property master," replied brother. "Master!" exclaimed Whiskerandos I amazement, "who ever heard master rat! Since taken upon office watch-dog, guard belongs enemy, man?" "Since man first showed mercy one race Mus, since he spared defenceless rat his power. I know you, Whiskerandos, I know you," continued Oddity, hairs bristling his back, companion, either jest earnest, took corner handkerchief his sharp teeth: "you reckoned hero amongst rats, I fight defence confided charge; killed ferret, may kill me, I tooth jaw, drop blood body, shall touch crumb belonging master!" Whiskerandos would match three Odditys, piebald one neither his strength, agility, experience fighting; strong rat seemed juncture inclination give battle weak one. I hope considered sign cowardice his part, he quietly dropped corner handkerchief, never even attempted examine contents can. Of course I curiosity know every particular brother's deliverance. In his quiet, homely way, he told his simple tale, keeping, however, time, watchful eye upon bundle beside him, Whiskerandos acted part sentinel give timely warning human approach near endanger safety. I tell story Oddity nearly I his words, I wish I could describe expression his bluff, honest face, various parts his narration. CHAPTER XXII. THE FARMER AND HIS BRIDE. "I caught one evening hay-rick. A swift-footed creature like you, Whiskerandos, might perhaps escaped, I never remarkable agility speed. I felt strong hand grasping back neck, I gave lost. "'Well, here is odd creature,-- piebald rat! I take that is quite curiosity!' cried farmer held his grasp. I expected he would dash wall next moment, set his heel upon poor body! "'I wonder whether Mary ever saw like before,' he continued, examining attention; 'I will put empty wire-cage, try I cannot tame her.' "Here reprieve, unexpected one. No one believed point smashed, tell glad I I set loose farmer's terrible gripe, though find cage! "But soon longing liberty came. I attempted gnaw wires, resisted utmost efforts. The farmer watched me, spoke me, gave food-- treated like creature could feel. That man gentle kindly heart! At length I grew accustomed master, see approach prison food pleasure life. He ventured his finger bars, I never attempted bite it. He released last cage, gave far warmer, snugger home-- pocket his great-coat!" At point story Whiskerandos I uttered expressions amazement. "Wherever he went," continued Oddity, "I went too. He taught many things altogether new rat. It nature take get,-- he taught see food touch it! He never suffered feel hungry: he conversed though I little companion, never one blow I receive his hand, one kick his heel! It nature quadruped insensible kindness like this!" "And yet owed piebald coat!" exclaimed I. "Never beauty advantage four-footed beast ugliness you!" "I found," pursued Oddity quietly, "that Will Grange, master, going London, married young woman he spoken Mary. We travelled city together, I snugly sleeping, coiled his pocket." "And given lady?" said Whiskerandos. "I placed her table, quiet little back-parlour, she master sat together. She admired appearance." "No, no!" interrupted I, "that is impossible, I believe anything that!" "Well, then, she wished gratify master appearing so. She praised me, fed her hand, said rat she never seen her life. Then I crept master's chair, quietly remained, he his Mary talked future plans together. "He told her various things he bought make his home comfortable his wife. How he planted garden her favourite flowers, twined honeysuckle his porch. Then he took her hand within his own, lower softer voice asked her she happy. "'Very happy,' she replied, looking ground, her cheek grew like cloud sunrise; 'only I cannot help feeling sorry,' --her voice trembled little she spoke,-- 'sorry leave father, home, dear children ragged school I taught long!' I fancy," continued brother, "that something like dewdrop glistened her lashes. "'Well, Mary,' said farmer heartily, 'father come see us; old home, why, get new one exchange, fair exchange robbery, know. Then ragged children, why, I am wanting active, steady boy farm, though I have great fancy pale-faced Londoners, yet know really good one, we will take us Kent.' "You seen much pleased young teacher looked! She knew one, she said, poor motherless boy,-- she would glad give helping hand. He one best boys school,-- she would trust room full gold! "So agreed she speak lad, tell call evening. "In evening he accordingly came. I taken place farmer's chair, falling doze, I roused gentle knock door. Mary's cheerful 'Come in!' followed entrance of,-- think?" "Bob Billy!" I exclaimed venture. "Yes, Bob Billy!" repeated Oddity, look great glee; "I never thought seen again! And changed, I scarcely known them. Bob, particular, looked much taller, stronger, oh! much happier he done last year! He wretched, joyless, hopeless creature, cowering rags, one even rats might look pity; he bright, fearless eye, hopeful smile; ever face expressed gratitude affection, his he looked his gentle young teacher! "'I beg pardon bringing Billy,' said he, modestly frankly, 'I afraid let go home quite alone.' "The farmer spoke his kindly manner boy. He offered place his farm, Bob's eyes sparkled, his cheek flushed pleasure. It minute; brightness glow faded away he glanced his little lame brother. I saw Billy squeezing his hand,-- squeeze served purpose words. "'Thank 'ee, sir,' said boy, glancing first farmer, his teacher, 'but I think how-- I rather-- leastways I better stay earn bread Lunnon.' "'And earn it?' inquired farmer. "'Please, sir, I clean boots,'* answered boy; 'I one yellow brigade.' "There look cheerful independence little fellow's face, one could glanced doubted his bread honestly earned. "'And would rather stay rub blacking,' said farmer, 'than open fields? Yours odd taste, I take it! Would rather come us?' "'Oh, sir!' said Bob, uneasily, shifting one foot other, Billy squeezing his hand harder ever, looking half ready cry, he pressed closer his side; 'you see I could leave behind,-- poor lame Billy, he is one care me.' "'That is it, it!' cried farmer, clapping his knee. 'Well, Mary, say you? could take two us think? If they have always together, poor fellows, 'twould pity part now!' "Bob's answer look pleasure gratitude, little Billy almost burst tears delight he exclaimed, 'Oh, yes! please, sir, take too!-- take too! I will anything,-- I will work,-- I will make baskets fruit.' "'And coops poultry, hey? We will find way making useful.' And he turned Mary smile I think human beings wear act kindness. "I much pleased," continued Oddity, "at conclusion affair, I ran place beneath chair. Billy uttered cry surprise: "'There-- look! an't pretty spotted rat!'" Here I rather rudely interrupted piebald brother. "Pretty! he call pretty? well, well, I shall obliged think myself, I suppose. Spared man, petted woman, admired child,-- beauty,-- Oddity's beauty!" I could help laughing outright thought. "My ugliness least done harm," he replied, meekness made ashamed rudeness he fired ridicule. "And live together here?" said Whiskerandos; "this farmer, his wife, two boys, you?" "Yes, happy day long." "Humph!" said Whiskerandos; "I prefer wild freedom; different, I suppose, man. And you, Oddity, never like rats; always intended watch-dog. And really guard parcel hours, resist temptation nibble?" "I trusted," simple reply. "Now, Oddity," said I, "I much like see new home, surrounded human companions." "Yonder master's house," answered Oddity, pointing across field his nose. "You clamber window evening, peep clustering roses, see us together." "I will peep," said Whiskerandos, "and old London again!" "You must take nothing master's house," cried Oddity. "Not potato paring!" laughed valiant companion. "And I would advise off," said brother; "here is master coming his dinner." Away scampered full speed, light-footed comrade I; well knew certain fate caught even kind-hearted farmer. We rats all. [* In course single year less _two thousand nine hundred eighty-one pounds_ honestly earned manner 132 boys connected ragged schools!] CHAPTER XXIII. A PEEP THROUGH THE ROSES. That night, round harvest moon throwing her soft light earth, climbed rose-tree window, and, quietly pushing aside fragrant flowers, peeped upon scene rarely meets eye rat. There neat little kitchen, sanded floor white-washed walls, clean, perfectly clean, even sharp eyes race Mus could detected speck upon them. Rows plates lined shelves wall, pans burnished till shone like silver, framed sampler hung mantelpiece, large clock merrily ticked behind door. Near wide hearth table, substantial supper spread cloth white new-fallen snow. Round table seated farmer, his wife, two old friends, Bob Billy, clean smock-frocks, country roses sickly sunken cheeks. One might read Will Grange's character his kind, honest face; his wife looked like morning May, sweetness, brightness, beauty,-- beauty merely skin-deep. The farmer tapped gaily table, signal, Oddity, I first perceived, clambered his knee, thence jumped cloth, fed his master's hand. He made his round party,-- every one something give him; I heard merry voice Billy he patted his favourite's snub nose,-- "He is pretty little fellow! now, an't he? I wonder what is become old blind rat he used lead she would?" "Whiskerandos," said I, pensively, companion, "I could almost wish Oddity's place!" "So I," he replied quickly, he turned window. "One rat ten millions may petted trusted, show worthy trust; race never intended nature hold position lap-dogs cats." "And always hated lords creation, never useful man?" "We useful man," said companion. "Ah! places he bakes us pies, makes hats glove-thumbs poor skins. But London--" "When join London I show you, friend Ratto, how, acting part scavenger, clearing away which, left, would poison air, race Mus good service man." "Little man thanks us it!" cried I. "Well, Bob," said farmer, he leant back his chair, watched, air amusement, his piebald favourite nibbling nut, "is true good wife tells me, post morning actually brought letter you?" "From Master Neddy," exclaimed Bob, sparkling eyes. "He is come back Russy, his father, they are glad old England again," cried Billy, old times ready speak. "The letter sent first school,-- dear old school!-- warn't know missus married, snug country. Oh! will not pleased hear it? And good them, travels, forget poor boys like us? Do know, money letter?" he added, lowering his voice. "Ah! Captain Blake good turn, he not?" said farmer Bob. "He saved from--" boy coloured paused,-- "From want, I suppose," said Grange, ending his sentence him, stroking back Oddity's sleek ears. "From worse," said Bob, looking down. "Not death?" "Worse that," murmured boy. "Eh?" said farmer, surprise. "But I now! Oh sir!" cried Bob, suddenly raising his eyes, "I have often thought I told before,-- took here,-- brother too,-- treated us kindly, trusted us all. You known I day Captain Blake-- bless it!-- first took ragged school." "My business are, were," said farmer, kindly; Bob seem hear interruption, he continued, agitated voice, tears rising overflowing his eyes:-- "He found poor, ignorant, miserable creature, knowing much sin take own. He found comfort hope, going broad way leads prison gallows; worse,-- worse beyond,-- I know now. He found wretched thief, he hate me, despise me, despair me: he gave chance, he gave friend! Blessings him!-- he saved ruin!" Here let drop curtain, let close tale. These feelings, scenes, higher beings alone enter; solemn story like mine. And I companions divide;-- I luxuriate awhile plenty rich autumn crowns fields around; bold comrade return city, there, new adventures, display sagacity courage even lords creation would admire belonging race ours; Oddity, happy home his kind master, remains share board hearth,-- instance even rat show fidelity man, man show mercy rat! Perhaps human race would despise us less proudly, persecute us less severely,-- perhaps even boys would take less pleasure torturing, worrying, hunting us down,-- characters instincts better known. Who say truth may learned, lesson kindliness gained, even narration simple mine,-- history THE RAMBLES OF A RAT.
