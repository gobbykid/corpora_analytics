 SIX TO SIXTEEN. _A STORY FOR GIRLS._ SIX TO SIXTEEN. INTRODUCTION. Eleanor I subject _fads_. Indeed, family failing. (By family I mean household, Eleanor I not, even distantly, related.) Life would comparatively dull, away moors, without them. Our fads boys' fads sometimes same, oftener distinct. Our present one would much tell account; would laugh us. It this. We purpose winter write stories lives present date. It seems egotistical perhaps silly thing record trivialities everyday lives, even fun, please ourselves. I said Eleanor, she said, "Supposing Mr. Pepys thought his everyday life, much instruction amusement would lost readers his Diary." To I replied, Mr. Pepys lived stirring times, amongst notable people, _his_ daily life like leaf English history, his case quite different case obscure persons living simply monotonously Yorkshire moors. On Eleanor observed simple truthful history single mind childhood would valuable, could got, whole Mr. Pepys' Diary first volume last. And Eleanor makes general observation kind her conclusive tone, I seldom dispute it; for, begin with, she generally right, she much clever I. One result confessed superiority her opinion mine I give way sometimes even I quite convinced, helped little weak-minded reason background. I gave way instance, altogether her argument (for I sure _my_ biography history mind, record small facts important one myself), chiefly I think one grows one enjoys recalling things happened one little. And one forgets soon! I envy Eleanor kept her childish diaries. I used write diaries too, but, I fourteen years old, I got much ashamed (it made quite hot read small moral reflections, pompous account quarrels Matilda, sentimental admiration handsome bandmaster, &c., even alone), I afraid boys getting hold them, I made big hole kitchen fire one day, burned all. At least, I thought; one volume escaped flames, fun Eleanor I re-reading made regret I burned others. Of course, even I put I remember, like kept diaries. Eleanor's biography, respect, much better mine; still, I remember good deal I dare say I shall forget soon, sixteen years histories may amuse us much old diaries. We growing now. We even got speaking "old times," mean times used wade brooks and---- But beside mark, I must allow wander off. I apt discursive. When I write leading articles manuscript periodical, Jack used laugh me, say, "If was not Eleanor's disentangling sentences, you would put parenthesis within parenthesis till, got inside one, you would puzzled pig labyrinth, know get back started from." And I remember Clement--who generally disputed point, possible--said, "How know she would not get back, let her work train thought peace? The curt, clean-cut French style may suit people, whose brains will not stretch far without getting tired; others may sympathy Semitic cast mind." This excuse pleased much. It pleasanter believe style Semitic, allow, Jack, tended towards Mrs. Nickleby. Though time notion meaning word Semitic precise might been. Our home beautiful place summer, much spring autumn. In winter I fancy would look dreary eyes strangers. At night wind comes top Deadmanstone Hill, valley, whirls last leaves old trees church, sends dancing closely-ranged gravestones. Then village comes, moans round house night, like miserable wanting get in. The boys say get in, enough, especially bedrooms; boys always grumble. It certainly makes strange noises here. I opened back-door late evening, I fancied one dogs hurt, groaning outside. That stormy winter Ladybrig murder, fancies wind together played Eleanor sad tricks. When began listen seemed hear whole tragedy going close outside. We could distinguish footsteps voices bluster, struggle shrubbery, _thud_, groan, roar wind, half drowning sound flying footsteps--and awful pause, last faint groaning, bump, poor wounded body falling house. At point will not summon courage rush out, kitchen poker candle shapeless tallow shrouds strong draughts. We never could see anything; partly, perhaps, candle always blown out; stood outside became evident heard wind, bough old acacia-tree, beat intervals upon house. When nights stormy room comfortable big kitchen. We first used parochial purposes, small night-schools, forth. Then one evening, strolled look one dogs, cook said, "You sit here, like, Miss Eleanor. _We_ always sits pantry winter nights; there will one disturb you." And writing hand wish discussed overlooked members family, settled great peace comfort roaring fire maids heaped keep kitchen warm absence. We found cosy independent returned new study. The boys (who go away great deal do, apt come back dissatisfied "ways," anxious make us "like people") object strongly habit ours. They say, "Who ever _heard_ ladies sitting kitchen?" And, indeed, many south-country kitchens I like sit. But large, airy, spotlessly clean room, stone floor, yellow-washed walls, tables scrubbed snowy whiteness, quaint old dresser clock corner cupboards shiny black oak, huge fire-place blazing fire ourselves, abundance room, may anything please, I think wonder like it, though be, point fact, kitchen. We cover table, (commonly) part floor, amount books, papers, belongings various sorts, scruple deluge drawing-room with. The fire crackles blazes, mind wind, though blinds kitchen, "cotter" shutters, look upon black night, tall Scotch pine tossed wildly many years, torn yet. Keziah cook takes much pride kitchen, partly accounts state suitable use. She "stones" floor excruciating regularity. (At least, people hate scraping sound. I mind myself.) She "pot-moulds" hearth fantastic patterns; chests, old chairs, settle, dresser, clock corner cupboards many mirrors constant polishing. She says, justice, "a body might eat his dinner anything place." We dine early, cooking late supper performed call "the second kitchen," beyond this. I believe Vicarage originally old farmhouse, charming kitchen chief "living-room." It quite journey, long, low passages, get modern part house this. One year, "languages fad" strong upon us, Eleanor I earned many backache carrying huge volumes _Della Crusca_ Italian dictionary dining-room shelves kitchen. We piled oak chest reference, ran backwards forwards table sat beat brains "Divina Commedia," wind growled tall old box-trees without, dogs growled dreams upon hearth. It well-scrubbed table, kitchen, biographies written. They cannot penned noses boys. Eleanor finds rocking help composition, she swinging backwards forwards glossy old rocking-chair, pen her lips, vacant gaze her eyes, becomes almost look inspiration swing chair turns her face towards ceiling. For part I find I meet crisis train ideas best upon feet, I pace past old black dresser, gleaming crockery, like captain his quarter-deck. Suddenly Eleanor's chair stands still. "Margery," she says, laying her head upon table her side, "I think capital idea." "Yours capital," I reply, pausing also, leaning back dresser; "for kept old diaries, and----" "My dear Margery, I kept old diaries? I have lived place whole life. Now, adventures! I quite look forward reading life, Margery. You idea pleasure gives think it. I thinking now, ever separated life, I shall enjoy looking again. You must give yours, know, I give mine. Yes; I glad thought it." And Eleanor begins rock more, I resume march. But quite settles matter mind. To please Eleanor I would try great deal; much this. I write autobiography. Though seems rather (to use expressive Quaker term) "need-not" provide separated life, firmly resolved old maids, live together lives little whitewashed cottage behind church. CHAPTER I. MY PRETTY MOTHER--AYAH--COMPANY. My name Margaret Vandaleur. My father captain her Majesty's 202nd Regiment Foot. The regiment India six years, I born; indeed, I many months old I made first voyage, I fancy Eleanor thinking she says I adventures. Military ladies said unlucky times change stations; move often chancing inconvenient moment. My mother make her first voyage cares young baby her hands; nominally, rate, I think chief care fell upon Ayah. My mother hired her England. The Ayah wished return her country, glad nurse. I think first she intended us voyage, she stayed on, became fond me, remained nurse long I India. I heard mother prettiest woman board vessel she went in, prettiest woman station she got there. Some people told she prettiest woman ever saw. She eighteen years old father married her, she six-and-twenty she died. [I got far writing life, seated round, three-legged pinewood table, Eleanor scribbling away opposite me. But I could get then. I put hands eyes shade light; Eleanor quick, she found I crying. She jumped threw herself feet. "Margery, dear Margery! _is_ matter?" I could sob, "My mother, O mother!" add, almost bitterly, "It well write childhood, mother--and mother!--all life; me----" Eleanor knelt straight up, her teeth set, her hands clasped her. "I think," she said slowly, "that I am, without exception, selfish, inconsiderate, dense, unfeeling brute ever lived." She looked quaintly, vehemently earnest she knelt firelight, I laughed spite tears. "My dear old thing," I said, "it I selfish, you. But I going now, I promise disturb more." And I resolute, though Eleanor would burned papers there, I prevented her. Indeed she knew well I merely I orphan I wept, I thought early childhood. We could speak it, she knew enough guess passing mind. I six years old mother died, I remember her. I remember her brief appearances room I played, much dirt contentment, Ayah's feet--rustling silks satins, glittering costly ornaments, beautiful scented, like fairy dream. I would forego visions one--only one--memory her praying bedside, teaching her knee. But she young, pretty! And yet, O Mother, Mother! better triumphs loveliness short prime would left memory beautiful face devout earnest look upon it--"as face angel"--to child. As I sit thinking thus, I find Eleanor's dark eyes gazing her place, she gone back; she says softly, "Margery, dear Margery, let us give up." But I would give now, anything whatever.] The first six years life spent chiefly Ayah. I loved her dearly. I kissed fondled her dark cheeks gladly fair ruddy, oftener I touched mother's, like petals china rose. My intimate friends Ayah's complexion. We one "bearer" years, I greatly attached. I spoke Hindostanee English. The day I saw group Lascar sailors Southampton Station; come ship, talking rapidly softly together. I forgotten language early childhood, tones familiar sound; dark bright faces like faces old friends, heart beat minute, one moved remembrance old home. When mother went her early ride daybreak, heat day came on, Ayah would hold window see her start. Sometimes father would brought out, take his horse minutes. But nurse never allowed ready excuse could prevent it. Her care maternal tenderness, she keep tidy enough presentable off-hand company. There always "company" wherever mother went--gentleman company especially. The gentlemen, different places, different times, same, common likeness. I used count rode home father mother, assembled many reasons "company" hung homes. I remember amusement discover, "there six to-day," "five to-day," tell Ayah. I even minute. I divided three classes: "the little ones, middle ones, old ones." The "little ones" young men--smooth-cheeked ensigns, etc.; "old ones" usually colonels, generals, elderly civilians. From youngest oldest, officers civilians, good-natured me, I approved accordingly. When callers came, I often sent drawing-room. Great dear Ayah's pride I dressed pink silk, hair arranged ringlets round head, shown company. I proud myself, will not rather strut walk room upon best kid shoes. They pink, match frock, I little vain them. There usually ladies room, dressed rustling finery like mother, like her face--never pretty. There always plenty gentlemen three degrees, used polite me, call "little Rosebud," give sweetmeats. I liked sweetmeats, I liked flattery, I affection stronger fancy either. I used look sharply assembled men face I wanted, I found I flew arms stretched me. They father's. I remember mother, I remember father better still. I see much him, together I think thoroughly happy. I recall pretty clearly one happy holiday spent together. My father got leave, took us short time hills. My clearest memory his face smiled me, broad hat, made nosegays Mamma's vases beautiful garden, fuchsias geraniums "hardy," sweet-scented verbenas heliotropes great bushes, loading air perfume. I one remembrance almost distinct--the last. CHAPTER II. THE CHOLERA SEASON--MY MOTHER GOES AWAY--MY SIXTH BIRTHDAY. We living bungalow far barracks X. cholera came. It I within weeks six years old. First heard among natives, matter excite much notice. Then broke among men, officers talked good deal it. The next news death Colonel commanding regiment. One early recollections hearing this. An ensign regiment (one "little ones") called upon mother evening day Colonel's death. He white, nervous, restless. He brought us news. The Colonel ill barely thirty-six hours. He suffered agonies wonderful firmness. He buried next day. "He never afraid cholera," said Mr. Gordon; "he did not believe infectious; he thought keeping men's spirits everything. But, see, is not nervousness, all, it." "It goes long way, Gordon," said father. "You are young; you have never one seasons. Do not get fanciful, good fellow. Come here, play Margery." Mr. Gordon laughed. "I fool, certainly," he said. "Ever since I heard it, I fancied strange, faint kind smell everywhere, absurd enough." "I make camphor-bag," said mother, "that ought overpower faint smell, charm infection." I believe Mr. Gordon beginning thank her, his words ended sort inarticulate groan. He stood his feet, though upright, last said feebly, "I beg pardon, I do not feel quite well." "You are upset, old fellow; it is quite natural," said father. "Come get brandy, shall come back camphor." My father led away, he come back. My father took his quarters, sent surgeon him; mother took her knee, sat silent long time, unfinished camphor-bag beside her. The next day I went end compound Ayah, see Colonel's funeral pass. The procession seemed endless. The horse he ridden two days mother's side tossed head fretfully, "Dead March" wailed, slow tramp feet poured endlessly on. My mother looking verandah. As Ayah I joined her, native servant, bringing something in, said abruptly, "Gordon Sahib--he dead too." When father returned funeral he found mother panic. Some friends lately invited her stay them, she resolved go. "I sure I shall die I stay here!" she cried, ended her going away once. There difficulty accommodating Ayah, decided that, necessary, follow mother later. For part, I begged remain. I fear cholera, I anxious dine father birthday, he promised I should. It day birthday one surgeons buried. The man next rank poor Colonel leave, regiment commanded friend Major Buller, whose little daughters invited spend following evening me. The Major, father, two officers pall-bearers funeral. My father came his return. He slightly chilled, said he remain indoors; I myself, happy, though he complained fatigue, fell asleep floor his head lap. He still lying floor Ayah took bed. I believe he unwell day, though I know it, taking many specifics cholera, everybody one time. Half-an-hour later he sent surgeon, happened dining Major Buller. The Doctor Major came together bungalow, two officers happened party, friends father. One particular friend own. He ensign, reckless, kind-hearted lad "in his teens," Mr. Abercrombie, good reason count father friend. Mr. Abercrombie mingled way dreams night, rather early morning, I fairly woke, end discussion betwixt Ayah, crying, Mr. Abercrombie, evening dress, whose face bore traces looked like crying also. I hastily clothed, he took his arms. "Papa wants you, Margery dear," he said; he carried quickly passages dim light early summer dawn. Two three officers, amongst I recognized Major Buller, fell back, came in, bed Mr. Abercrombie carried me. My father turned his face eagerly towards me, I shrank away. That one night suffering collapse changed I know again. At last I persuaded go him, his voice manner recognized his feeble fingers played tenderly mine. And he said, "Kiss me, Margery dear," I crept kissed his forehead, started feel cold damp. "Be good girl, Margery dear," he whispered; "be good Mamma." There short silence. Then he said, "Is sun rising yet, Buller?" "Just rising, old fellow. Does light bother you?" "No, thank you; I cannot see it. The fact is, I cannot see now. I suppose it is nearly over. GOD'S done. You have got papers, Buller? Arkwright kind it, I am sure. You will break wife well can?" After another pause he said, "It is time fellows went bed got sleep." But one moved, another silence, father broke saying, "Buller, you? It is quite dark now. Would say Lord's Prayer me, old fellow? Margery dear, put hands poor Papa's." "I have said prayers yet," said I; "and know I ought say prayers, I have dressed long time." The Major knelt simply bed. The men, standing, bent heads, Mr. Abercrombie, kneeling, buried his face end bed sobbed aloud. Major Buller said Lord's Prayer. I, believing duty, said also, father said us clause "For Thine kingdom, power, glory," his voice failed, I, thinking he forgotten (for I sometimes forgot middle familiar prayers hymns), helped him--"Papa dear! _for ever ever_." Still he silent, I bent I heard one long-drawn breath, his hands, enfolded mine, fell apart. The sunshine beginning catch objects room, ray lighted father's face, showed change even I could see. An officer standing head bed saw also, said abruptly, "He is dead, Buller." And Major, starting up, took his arms, carried away. I cried struggled. I dim sense happened, mixed idea men separating father. I could pacified till Mr. Abercrombie held his arms me. He like woman, he crying well I. I went buried sobs his shoulder. Mr. George (as I long called him, finding his surname hard utter) carried passage walked down, comforting me. "Is Papa really dead?" I length found voice ask. "Yes, Margery dear. I am sorry." "Will he go Abraham's bosom, Mr. George?" "Will he go _where_, Margery?" "To Abraham's bosom, know, poor beggar went that is lying steps Sunday picture-book, playing dear old dogs." Mr. Abercrombie's knowledge Holy Scripture was, I fear, limited. Possibly remarks recalled childish remembrance similar own. He said, "Oh yes, sure. Yes, dear." "Do think dogs went poor beggar?" I asked. "Do think angels took too?" "I do not know," said Mr. George. "I hope did." There pause, I asked, awe-struck tones, "Will angels fetch Papa, think?" Mr. George evidently decided follow theological lead, he replied, "Yes, Margery dear." "Shall see them?" I asked. "No, no, Margery. I am good enough see angels." "_I_ think you are good," said I. "And please good, Mr. George, angels fetch you, perhaps me, Mamma, perhaps Ayah, perhaps Bustle, perhaps Clive." Bustle Mr. Abercrombie's dog, Clive mastiff, dog regiment, personal friend mine. "Very well, Margery dear. And must good too, must let take bed, it is morning now, I sleep all." "Is to-morrow now?" I asked; "because, it is to-morrow, it is birthday." And I began cry afresh, Papa promised I dine him, promised present also. "I will give birthday present," said long-suffering friend; he began unfasten locket hung his watch-chain. It Indian gold, forget-me-nots turquoise stones upon it. He opened pulled photograph, he tore bits, trampled underfoot. "There, Margery, there is locket you; throw fire, anything like it. And I wish many happy returns day." And he finally fastened round neck his Trichinopoli watch-chain, leaving his watch loose his waistcoat-pocket. The locket chain pleased me, I suffered carry bed. Then, he parting me, I thought father again, asked: "Do think angels fetched Papa _now_, Mr. George?" "I think have, Margery." Whereupon I cried sleep. And sixth birthday. CHAPTER III. THE BULLERS--MATILDA TAKES ME UP--WE FALL OUT--MR. GEORGE. Major Buller took home his house father's death. My father left his affairs his hands, friend England--the Mr. Arkwright he spoken of. I believe trustees mother's marriage settlement. The Bullers relations mine. Mrs. Buller mother's cousin. She kind-hearted, talkative lady, good-looking, though longer young. She dressed gaily poor mother, though, somehow, quite good effect. She copied mother's style, sometimes wore things exactly similar hers; result same. I heard Mrs. Minchin say mother took malicious pleasure, times, wearing costumes would trying beauty less radiant youthful hers, fun seeing "poor Theresa" appear similar garb less success. But Mrs. Minchin's tales always sting them! Mrs. Buller received kindly. She kissed me, told call her "Aunt Theresa," I ever afterwards. Aunt Theresa's daughters I like sisters. They showed best frocks, told exactly ordered parcel coming England. "Do not hair put papers?" said Matilda, whose curls sat stiffly round her head regularly rolls lawyer's wig. "Are socks like lace? Does not Ayah dress every afternoon?" Matilda "took up." She four years older I was, entitled her blend patronage her affection me. In evening day I went Bullers, she took hand, tossing her curls said, "I taken up, Margery Vandaleur. Mrs. Minchin told Mamma she taken bride up. I heard her say bride sweet little puss, childish. That is Mrs. Minchin said. I heard her. And I shall say you, too, I have taken up. You are sweet little puss. And course you are childish, you are child," adds Miss Matilda, air. For she begun write her age two figures? Had I known much I learned afterwards meant "taken up" Mrs. Minchin, I might thought comparison good omen friendship Matilda. To hotly taken Mrs. Minchin meant equally hot quarrel distant date. The squabble bride slow come, Matilda I fell first. I think she tyrannical, I know I peevish. My Ayah spoilt me; I spoke broken English, means understood Bullers said me; besides which, I feverishly unhappy intervals father. It two months Mrs. Minchin found her sweet little puss deceitful little cat; end two days I offended Matilda, plunged war words children wage squabble. "I will not show dresses," said Matilda. "I have seen all," I boldly asserted; stroke told. "You do not know that," said Matilda. "Yes, I do." "No, do not." "Well, show others then." "No, I will not." "I do not care." "I have got blue silk coming England," Matilda continued, "but have not." "I have got pink silk here," said I, "and pink shoes." "Ah, cannot wear papa's dead," said Matilda; "Mamma says wear black twelve months." I sure Matilda mean cruel, blow cut deeply. I remember tide misery seemed flood mind, day. I miserable father dead, I could go comfort. I miserable I temper, Matilda best quarrel. I miserable--poor little wretch!--because I could wear pink silk, father dead. I put hands eyes, screaming, "Papa! Papa!" I rushed verandah. As I ran out, one ran in; struck other, Bustle I rolled floor. In moment I Mr. Abercrombie's arms, sobbing woes him. I sorry say he swore rather loudly he heard Matilda said, I fancy he lectured her I gone Ayah, she came presently begged pardon. Of course friendly before. Many another breach us that, hastily made quickly healed. But bride Mrs. Minchin never came terms. "Mr. George" remained devoted friend. I looked I used look father. The first time I saw I came Bullers day father's funeral. He there, came back Major Buller. I Mr. George's knee moment, hand crape upon his sleeve. The Major slowly unfastened his sword-belt, laid sigh, saying, "We have lost good man, Abercrombie, true friend." "You do not know friend me," said Mr. George impetuously. "Why, look here, sir. A month two ago I would outrun constable--I always getting mess sort--and Vandaleur found lent money." "You are first youngster he helped many, knowledge," said Major Buller. "But that is all, sir," said Mr. George, standing his arms. "When first went night, remember his speaking privately once? Well, he said was, 'I think I am following rest, Abercrombie, I wanted speak this.' He got I.O.YOU. his hand, he tore across, said, 'Do not bother it; keep straight, boy, can, people's sake.' I am sadly given going crooked, sir, anything could make fellow----" Mr. George got his sentence, Major seemed understand he meant, he spoke kindly him, left bit walked verandah together. Just Mr. George left, I heard say, "Have heard anything Mrs. Vandaleur?" "I wrote her, best fashion I could," said Major Buller. "But there is breaking rough news gently, Abercrombie. I ought hear her soon." But he never hear her. My poor mother fled cholera fall victim fever. The news father's death was, I believe, immediate relapse she died. And I became orphan. Shortly afterwards regiment ordered home, Bullers took them. CHAPTER IV. SALES--MATTERS OF PRINCIPLE--MRS. MINCHIN QUARRELS WITH THE BRIDE--MRS. MINCHIN QUARRELS WITH EVERYBODY--MRS. MINCHIN IS RECONCILED--THE VOYAGE HOME--A DEATH ON BOARD. I remember little voyage home troop-ship, I heard much it, elder Buller girls ladies regiment, I seem quite familiar happened; I hardly know I remember myself, recalled suggested hearing ladies talk. There lack subjects talk news came regiment ordered home. As Aunt Theresa repeatedly remarked, "There great many things considered." And she considered day long--by word mouth. The Colonel (that is, new Colonel)--he returned leave hills--and his wife behaved rather shabbily, thought. "But," Mrs. Minchin said, "what could expect? They say she daughter wholesale draper City. And trade blood always peeps out." We knew certain word said regiment going home, settled Colonel's wife go England, her daughters educated, take two youngest children her. Her passage mail-steamer taken, quite. And then, heard troop-ship, she stayed go home that. "Money object them," said Mrs. Minchin, "for one City people belonging her died lately, left her--I cannot tell many thousands. Indeed, they have heaps money, he is got regiment he ought retire. And I must say, I think it is hard you, dear Mrs. Buller. With family, senior officer's wife's accommodation would little enough, long voyage." "Which reason wife better accommodation she entitled to, lady board," observed Uncle Buller. "The Quartermaster's wife children have, know much room she get." "Quartermaster's wife!" muttered Mrs. Minchin. "She would accommodated women regiment gone home three months ago (at time Quartermaster Curling still sergeant)." Uncle Buller made reply. He fond Mrs. Minchin, he never disputed point her. One topic day "sales." We sell want take home, point choose right moment so. "I shall not first," said Aunt Theresa decidedly. "The first sales always failures somehow. People depressed. Then know plenty come, hang back. But on, people got extravagant humour, would go bargain-hunting fifty sales day. Later still, find they have got want." "And great deal do not want," put Uncle Buller. "Which thing," said Aunt Theresa. "So I shall sell middle." Which she did, demanding her friends' condolences beforehand way her goods chattels would "given away," receiving congratulations afterwards upon high prices fetched. To Aunt Theresa justice, she managing, she quite honest. [Eleanor shocked things I say people rank life. She believes certain vulgar vices, cheating, lying, gluttony, petty gossip, malicious mischief-making, etc., confined lower orders, or, she wisely kindly phrases it, people know better. She laughs me, I laugh myself, I say (to support views) I know world she does; since I know world beyond happy corner I learned I mere child. But though laugh, I remember good deal. I heard polished gentlemen lie, pinch, like proverbial pick-pocket, pretty ladies fib well servant-girls. Of course, I mean say many ladies servant-girls tell untruths. But Eleanor would fain believe lie Solomon discovered "continually lips untaught" lips "know better" all. As dishonesty, too, I sorry say customers cheat much shopkeepers, I think many people ought "know better" seem forget honour well interest concerned every bargain. The question arises, people rank know much better points moral conduct them? If Eleanor her parents "old-fashioned" (and boys think us quite behind times), I fancy, perhaps high principle nice sense honour well taught used be. Noble sentiments fashion. The phrase provokes smile ridicule. But I know whether habit uttering ignoble ones "chaff" last bring tone mind low level. It terribly easy mean, covetous, selfish, cowardly untrue, people whose good opinion one's character lives comfortably confess also "look themselves," "take care Number One," think "money's great thing world," hold "the social lie" necessary part social intercourse. I know twice happened young people thrown said things made high-principled Eleanor stand aghast honourable horror; speechless indignation much lost upon touch feather hide rhinoceros. Eleanor impatient I subjects. I trained one school myself, sorry never known higher teaching. Eleanor thinks modesty, delicacy mind taste, uprightness word deed, innate worthy characters. Where she finds absent, she apt dilate her nostrils, say, low, emphatic voice her excited tone, "There things cannot _put into_ anybody!" turn her back ever offender. Or, she said friend boys, staying us, heat argument, "I supposed honourable men, like poets, born, made." I, indeed, believe qualities great measure inherited; I believe also come training, easily lost Eleanor allow. She lived one moral atmosphere. I think standard family social circle falls easily; humbleness mind, I say I reason believe respect, matters, elevation amendment possible. However, one many subjects discuss, rocking pacing kitchen howling wind. We confessed experience small, opinions still unfixed matter, unlikely I shall settle own, anybody's satisfaction, pages biography.] To return Aunt Theresa. She was, I said, honest. She chose good moment sale; she "doctor" things. For credit regiment, I feel ashamed confess everybody scrupulous. One lady sat drawing-room, twenty-five pounds' worth lace upon her dress, congratulated herself sold toilette-china sound, she daintily doctored two fractures invaluable cement. The pecuniary gain may half-a-crown. The loss self-respect she seem estimate. Aunt Theresa would done herself, she laughed encouragingly. It difficult strait-laced lady much old point, whose silks stiff she rustle remonstrances. Another friend, young officer whose personal extravagance proverb even station India, boasted week sold rickety knick-knack shelf man going hills five-and-twenty rupees worth six. I heard swear tailors, servants, subordinates kinds, cheating. I think ever dawned upon his mind common honesty virtue he wanting. As Mrs. Minchin's tales subject--but Mrs. Minchin's tales relied upon. It time Mrs. Minchin bride quarrelled. In weeks her arrival, bride knew ladies regiment society station, showed little inclination bear-led Mrs. Minchin. She met terrible lady smartly one occasion she retired, worsted, afternoon, bride drove triumphantly round place, called her friends, looking soft Chinchilla muff, dropping every bungalow tale something Mrs. Minchin said, means advantage inmates. It way Aunt Theresa came know Mrs. Minchin said her wearing half-mourning father mother. That she knew better go deep black, trying indefinite complexions, equal length grief lavenders, delicate combinations black white, becoming everybody, especially people quite young been. In warmth her indignation unwarrantable remarks, bride's ready sympathy, Aunt Theresa felt herself candour bound reveal Mrs. Minchin told her bride's sold lot her wedding presents sale fancy prices; new-fashioned ornaments, forth, yet got station. The result general information round was, course, quarrel Mrs. Minchin nearly every lady regiment. The bride failed let "the Colonel's lady" know Mrs. Minchin thought her going home troop-ship, made call upon Quartermaster's wife pleasure making her acquainted Mrs. Minchin's warm wish regiment ordered home three months sooner, Mrs. Curling numerous little Curlings would entitled intrude upon ladies' cabin. And yet, strange say, half-way England, Mrs. Minchin friendly bride; bride enmity every lady board. The truth is, Mrs. Minchin, though gossip deepest dye, kind-hearted, fashion. Her restless energy, chiefly expended petty social plots, fomentation quarrels, seldom employed also practical kindness towards happened favour her. She really interested--for good evil--in whose affairs she meddled, she dangerous enemy, yet dangerous friend, she neither selfish illiberal. The bride, hand, real interest whatever anybody's affairs her own, combined highest degree qualities personal extravagance general meanness unfrequently go together. A long voyage small test temper; situation Mrs. Minchin's best qualities shone. It proportionably unfavourable bride. Her maid sick, she slovenly. She sick herself, her selfishness discontent knew check. The ladies bore little troubles, helped other; peevish egotism bride, her warmest friends revolted. It Mrs. Minchin resumed her sway amongst us. With Aunt Theresa she soon reconciled. Mrs. Buller's memory always hazy, reference she said herself, said her. She good-natured strain recall past grievances. Her indignation lasted much beyond afternoon bride scattered discord among her acquaintances. She relieved herself outpouring tale Mrs. Minchin's treachery Uncle Buller, taking warmly task indifference he heard her wrongs; ended laughing heartily he compared probable encounter Mrs. Minchin bride deadly struggles two quarrelsome "praying-mantises" his collection. [Major Buller naturalist, took home rare beautiful specimens Indian insects.] It outbreak sickness amongst little Curlings led reconciliation Quartermaster's wife. Neither her kindness heart her love managing folks' matters would permit Mrs. Minchin passive then. She made first advances, poor Mrs. Curling gratefully responded. "I am sure, Mrs. Minchin," said she, "I do not wonder one thinking children would way, poor dears. But course, Curling said----" "GOD bless you, good woman," Mrs. Minchin broke in. "Do not let us go back that. We know pretty well Mrs. Seymour's made of, now. Let us go children. I am good sick-nurse people, keep heart we will pull get Cape." But her zeal (and stop short quarrel surgeon) her devotion, never slackened, Mrs. Minchin "pull through." We Cape Arthur Curling died. He age, beginning voyage playfellows. Of children swarmed deck distraction (at least) unmarried officers regiment, he noisiest merriest. He made fancy ships corners, he admitted children fancy passengers, fancy ship's officers various grades. Once he employed dozen us haul rope "heaving log." Owing unexpected coil, slackened suddenly, fell one another feet two young officers marching down, arm-in-arm, absorbed conversation. Their anger loud well deep, deter Arthur Curling exploits, stop his ceaseless chatter he would he man captain vessel. He live either one other. Some rough weather Cape fatal critical point his illness. How Mrs. Minchin contrived keep her feet nurse poor boy she marvel. He died her knees. The weather rough time his death, calm lovely morning his body committed deep. The ship's bell tolled daybreak, ladies bride poor Mrs. Curling funeral. Mrs. Seymour lay her berth, whined complaints "that horrid bell." She displayed something interesting terror shrewish anger "a body board." When she said Curlings ought thankful one child less provide for, ladies hurried indignantly cabin. The early morning air fresh mild. The sea sky grey, peaceful. The decks freshly washed. The sailors various parts ship uncovered heads. The Colonel several officers present. I earnestly begged also, finding Mr. George, I stood hand his. Mrs. Curling's grief passed point tears. She she would one since boy died, though Mrs. Minchin tried hard move her natural relief weeping. She stood silent agony, though Quartermaster's cheeks wet, ladies sobbed aloud. As little coffin slid hatchway quiet sea, sun rose, long level beam covered place body gone down. Then, sudden cry, mother burst tears. CHAPTER V. A HOME STATION--WHAT MRS. BULLER THOUGHT OF IT--WHAT MAJOR BULLER THOUGHT OF IT. Riflebury, south England--our next station--was lively place. "There always something going on." "Somebody always dropping in." "People called stayed lunch friendly way." "One sure one afternoon tea." "What croquet archery Gardens, meeting friends Esplanade, concerts Rooms, shopping, changing one's novels circulating library, one really never dull hour." So said "everybody;" one two people, including Major Buller, added "One never hour one's self." "If one occupation, you would know maddening is," he exclaimed, one day, fit desperation. "Any one occupation!" cried Mrs. Buller, he spoken. "I am sure, Edward, I am always busy. I never quiet moment morning night, seems me. But like men! You stick one thing along, meals come dropped skies, clothes come ready-made tailor's (and dearly paid for, too!); one ordering dinner luncheon, keeping one's clothes decent, looking children servants, taking card, contriving excuses fibs people ought call on, week's end week's end--you say one occupation." "Well, well, dear," said Major, "I know trouble household, I meant say pursuit, study----" "And visitors," continued Aunt Theresa, always pursued her train ideas, irrespective replies, "I am sure society's pleasure me; I call people ought call on, keep acquaintances children's sake. You would not us without friend world girls come out; really, regimental duties morning, insects afterwards, Edward, absorbed, was not lady friend coming then, I hardly soul speak to." The Major melted moment. "I afraid I inattentive husband," he said. "You must forgive me, dear. And sprained ankle keeping makes cross, too. And I reckoned days home finish list Coleoptera, get dissecting mounting done. But to-day, Mrs. Minchin brought her work directly breakfast, empty-headed fellow Elliott dropped lunch, callers afternoon, _coterie_ tea, Mrs. St. John (who seems get life somehow without indefinite notion time passes) came tea over, order fresh supply dressing dinner, dinner spoilt waiting till she discovered she idea (whoever know her idea?) late was, Mr. St. John would angry. And want go cab concert Rooms meet people again!" "I am sure I do not care Mrs. St. John bit do," said Mrs. Buller. "And really she repeat things sometimes--without ever looking round see girls room. She told thing to-day old Lady Watford told her." "My dear, her ladyship's stories well known. Cremorne's wife hears her, tells her husband, he tells fellows. I always hear I wish. But I care to. But do not like Mrs. St. John, Theresa, earth made ask her come sit morning?" "Well, dear, I do?" said Mrs. Buller. "She is always saying everybody unsociable, she dull, she does not know herself, begging take work go sit her morning. How I go leave children servants, time day everything wants set going? So I thought I would better ask her come instead. It is great bore, I keep eye house, one else drops I leave together. It is she wants, it is something amuse her. "You talk nothing do," Aunt Theresa plaintively continued. "But I am sure I hardly sleep night sometimes thinking I ought have not done. Mrs. Jerrold, know, made promise faithfully coming away write her every mail, I never find time. Every week, comes round, I think I will, cannot. I used think one good thing coming home would writing English mail; Indian mail quite bad. And I am sure mail-day seems come round quicker day week. I quite dread Fridays. And mother sisters always saying I never write. And I heard Mrs. Pryce Smith morning, telling I owed her two letters; I do not know say her I write, she knows nobody _here_, I know nobody _there_. And we have never returned Ridgeways' call, dear. And we have never called Mercers since dined there. And Mrs. Kirkshaw always begging drive spend day Abbey. I know she getting offended, I have put her often; Mrs. Minchin says she touchy. And Mrs. Taylor looks quite reproachfully I have near Dorcas meetings long. But it is well people children work things. A mother's time her own, charity begins home. I am sure I never seem rest, yet people never satisfied. Lady Burchett says she is certain I never home, she always misses she calls; Mrs. Graham says I never go out, she is sure, she never meets anywhere." "Is not I say?" said Major Buller, laying his knife fork. (The discussion took place dinner.) "It is tyranny idle busy; why, name common sense, yielded to? Why friends obliged, peril disparagement affection good manners, visit want go--to receive convenient, write nothing say? You women, dear, I must say, foolish respect men. Men simply will not write long letters friends they have nothing say, I do not think friendships suffer it. And though heaps idle gossiping fellows, well ladies qualities, man busy would never tolerate his inconvenience, much less invite persecute him. We straightforward other, is, all, firmest foundation friendship. It partly misplaced amiability, phase unselfishness excel us, partly also, I think, want measuring quality makes women exact unreasonable things, make impossible promises, blandly undertaking multiplicity small matters would tax method man business accomplish punctually, put whole time disposal every fool pleased waste it." "It is well talking, Edward," said Aunt Theresa. "But one do?" "Make stand," said Major. "When you are busy, cannot conveniently see people, let servant tell many words. The friendship cannot survive hardly worth keeping, I think. Eh, dear?" But I suppose stand made on, Major Buller took Aunt Theresa concert "the Rooms." CHAPTER VI. DRESS AND MANNER--I EXAMINE MYSELF--MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER. When began biographies resolved neither us read other's till finished. This partly thought would satisfactory able go straight them, partly check propensity beginning things finishing them, liable, partly childish habit "saving treat last," used--in "old times"--to pick raisins puddings lay _bonne bouche_ done duty solid portion. But resolve given way. We began much wishing break it, ended finding excellent reasons so. We wish read biographies--why tease sticking obstinately first opinion? No doubt would nice read "straight through." But rather apt devour books pace unfavourable book-digestion, perhaps better still read bits, one reads thing "comes numbers." And short, point Eleanor took mine, read it, I read hers. She lays mine, saying, "But, dear, do not remember this?" Which true. What I recorded first English home I know sources I positively remember. And yet I positive memories it, too. I hinted poor young mother look much. Also Ayah, mother's love care me, paid little attention tidy person dress, except I exhibited "company." But mother dead. Ayah (after terrible parting) left behind India. And time I passed Aunt Theresa's charge, matters quite changed. I remember dresses I then, keen interest I took subject dress early age. A keen interest taken Aunt Theresa herself, Aunt Theresa's daughters, ladies Aunt Theresa's acquaintance. I think I may say formed (at least one of) principal subjects conversation working hours day ladies freely sacrificed other. Mrs. Buller truly kind, I sure I depended every way upon her, she would given costume much care she bestowed upon her daughters. But parents poor; lack money maintenance, thus "no reason," Aunt Theresa said, clothes "decent," "decent" Aunt Theresa her friends synonym "fashionable." Thus first black frock improvement (in fashion) upon pink silk one, deprive deep mourning much gloom. Mrs. (Colonel) St. Quentin could refuse lend one her youngest little girl's frocks copy, "the poor little orphan"; bevy ladies sat consultation it, Mrs. St. Quentin's things well worth copying. "Keep paper pattern, dear," said Mrs. Minchin; "it come girls. Her things always good." And Mrs. Buller kept paper pattern. I remember dress quite clearly. It fixed mind incident connected it. It six crape tucks, fact I proud, heard good deal said it. The first time Mr. George came bungalow, I begun wear it, I strutted holding skirt out, head up. "Look black frock, Mr. George," said I; "it got six crape tucks." Matilda precocious in--at least--one way: she could repeat grown-up observations wonderful length. "It is best crape," she said; "it will not spot. Cut bias. They are real tucks though, Margery. They are laid on; Mrs. Minchin said so." "They real tucks," I stoutly asserted. "No, they are not. They are cut bias, laid imitate tucks," Matilda repeated. I think she sorry weak point fashionable mourning she share. I turned Mr. George, usual. "Are not real tucks, Mr. George?" But Mr. George strange look his face puzzled disconcerted me. He said, "Good heavens!" And efforts vain find he meant, he looked strange manner. Little things puzzle one childhood remain long one's memory. For years I puzzled look Mr. George's, remembrance never pleasant one. It chilled enthusiasm new dress time, made feel inclined cry. I think I lived understand it. But I insensible great loss, though I took pride fashionable mourning. I think I much connected two mind. I talk father one Mr. George, night I often lay awake cried him. This habit certainly affected health, I become thin, weak child home voyage came restore strength. By time reached Riflebury, fashionable new dress neither new fashionable. It Mrs. Minchin ferreted dressmaker Mrs. St. Quentin employed, I put her hands. The little Bullers' things "made house," pattern mine. "And one sees fashion-book, gets hints," said Mrs. Buller. If Mr. George duly impressed fashionable mourning, I could (young I was) trace effect Aunt Theresa's care appearance friends regiment. They openly remarked it, scruple hearing. Callers neighbourhood patronized also. Pretty ladies fashionably pitched bonnets smiled, said, "One little ones, Mrs. Buller? What pretty little thing!" duly sympathized sad story Aunt Theresa seemed almost enjoy relating. Sometimes agony hear oft-repeated tale parents' death, I enjoyed sort gloomy importance gave satisfaction. I even rehearsed scenes mind I bed, shedding real tears (in person Aunt Theresa) I related sad circumstances grief imaginary acquaintance; then, dry eyes, prolonging "fancy" compliments consolations flattering nature. I always took care fancy circumstances led best dress occasion. Gentleman company haunt new home case Indian one. But officers regiment called Mrs. Buller, would say, "Is poor Vandaleur's child? Dear me! Very interesting little thing;" speculate hearing possibility growing like mother. "'Pon soul, she _is_ like her!" said one "middle ones" one day, examining his eyeglass, "Th' expressive eyes, know, graceful gracious little manner poor Mrs. Vandaleur had. By Jove, shocking thing! She uncommonly pretty woman." "You never saw _her_ mother, good fellow," said one "old ones" present. "She _had_ graceful gracious manner, like, Mrs. Vandaleur named day her. Mrs. Vandaleur knew dress, I grant you----" "You may go play, Margery dear," said Aunt Theresa, kindly delicacy. The "old one" lowered his voice, still I could hear he said, Mrs. Buller saw. When father spoken of, feelings little hurt. On occasion mind engaged simply question whether I inherit mother's graces. I ran little looking-glass nursery examined eyes; I tried make "expressive," I either frowned unpleasantly, stared absurdly, I could flatter point. The girls out; I nothing do; nursery empty. I walked about, shaking skirts, thinking gracious graceful manner. I felt pardonable curiosity see myself, and, remembering big glass Aunt Theresa's room, I stole see I could make use unobserved. But gentlemen gone, I feared Mrs. Buller might come up-stairs. In minutes, however, door-bell rang, I heard sound visitor ushered drawing-room. I seized chance, ran Aunt Theresa's room. The mirror "full length," one could see better I saw myself. Once I attempted make expressive eyes, result favourable vanity. Then I drew back door, and, advancing upon mirror mincing steps, I threw grace graciousness I conscious manner, holding hand, said, "company voice," "_Charmed_ see you, I am sure!" "_Mais c'est bien drôle!_" said soft voice close behind me. I heard door open, yet stood Aunt Theresa threshold, her little old lady. The little old lady bright, delicately cut face, eyes whose expressiveness could question, large grey curls. She wore large hat, large bows tied her chin, dark-green satin driving-cloak lined white grey fur. She looked like fairy godmother, like ghost ancestor--like "somebody picture." She great-grandmother. CHAPTER VII. MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER--THE DUCHESS'S CARRIAGE--MRS. O'CONNOR IS CURIOUS. I much discomfited. My position dignified one best, childhood small shames seem terrible ever outlived. My great-grandmother laughed heartily, Mrs. Buller, whose sense humour small, looked annoyed. "What world here, Margery?" she said. I little moral courage, I trained high principles. If I could thought plausible lie, I fear I told dilemma. As was, I could not; I put hand burning cheek, said: "Let see!" I must certainly presented comical appearance, little old lady's smiles died away, her eyes filled tears. "It strange, not," she said Aunt Theresa, "that, all, I laugh meeting?" Then, sitting box door, she held her hands me, saying: "Come, little Margery, sin practising one's good manners mirror. Come kiss me, dear child; I father's father's mother. Is old woman? I great-grandmother." My great-grandmother's voice soft, her cheek soft, her cloak soft. I buried face fur, cried quietly shame excitement; she stroking head, saying: "_Pauvre petite!_--thou orphan, I doubly childless! It thus meet last join hands across graves two generations love!" "It dreadful thing!" said Mrs. Buller, rummaging her pocket clean handkerchief. "I am sure I never forget it, I lived thousand years. I never seemed able realize gone; sudden." The old lady made answer, wept silence. Aunt Theresa first recover herself, she insisted coming down-stairs. A young regimental surgeon his wife dropped lunch, great-grandmother stayed. We sitting drawing-room afterwards, "Mrs. Vandaleur's carriage" announced. As great-grandmother took leave me, she took watch chain hung neck. It small French watch enamelled back dark blue, word "Souvenir" small pearls. "I gave grandfather long years ago, child, he gave back me--before he sailed. I would part his son's child. Farewell, _petite_! Be good, dear child--try good. Adieu, Mrs. Buller, thousand thanks! Major Buller, I service." Major Buller took hand she held led old lady front door, whither followed them. Mrs. Vandaleur's carriage steps. It quaint little box two wheels, means good repair. It drawn pony, white, old, shaggy. At pony's head stood small boy decent, smart, plain clothes. "Put mat wheel save dress, Adolphe," said old lady; little boy obeyed her order she stepped nimbly carriage, assisted Major. "The silk old," she observed complacently; "but best, course, would worn to-day," she gave graceful little bow towards Aunt Theresa; "and I hope that, care, serve rest life, cannot long." "If wears well do, Madam," said Major Buller, tucking her in, "it may; otherwise." The Surgeon leaning side little cart, seemed also making polite speeches. It recalled way men used hang upon mother's carriage. The old lady smiled, made gracious little replies, meanwhile deliberately took her kid gloves, folded, put her pocket. She drew pair old worsted ones. "Economy, economy," she said, smiling, giving hand side her two gentlemen. "May I trouble reins? Many thanks. Farewell, gentlemen! I cannot pretend fear horse catch cold--his coat thick; may. Adieu, Mrs. Buller, more. Farewell, little one, I wish good-morning, Madam. Adolphe, seat yourself; make bow, Adolphe. Adieu, dear friends!" She gave flick whip, pony resented shaking his head; he seemed, speak, snatch little cart, great-grandmother, Adolphe, run good round pace. "What extraordinary turn-out!" said Surgeon's wife. (She Irish attorney's daughter, commonest faces, unprecedented bonnets. She her husband lately "set up" waggonette, expense made difficult live upon means, varnish added care life.) "Fancy driving High Street that!" she continued; "and everybody going out, too!" "Uncommon sensible little affair, I think," said Surgeon. "Suits old lady capitally." "Mrs. Vandaleur," said Major Buller, "can afford independent appearances extent would perhaps safe us." "You are right there, Buller," said Surgeon. "Wonderfully queenly she is! That fur cloak looks like ermine robe her." "I do not think you would like see it!" tittered his wife. "I do not say I should," returned Surgeon, rather smartly. "My dear," said Mrs. Buller, "you must make mind jealous Duchess. All gentlemen mad her." "The Duchess!" said Mrs. O'Connor, tone respect. "I thought said----" "Oh, she really duchess, dear; it is nickname. I will tell day. It is long story." Discovering Mrs. Vandaleur family connection, chance visitor neighbourhood, Mrs. O'Connor apologized her remarks, tried extract Duchess's history Aunt Theresa there. But Mrs. Buller would promise tell "another time." "I am dying curiosity," said Mrs. O'Connor, she took leave, "I shall run to-morrow afternoon purpose hear it. Can me, dear Mrs. Buller?" "Pray come," said Aunt Theresa warmly, amiable disregard two engagements arrears domestic business. I drawing-room next day Mrs. O'Connor arrived. "May I come in, dear Mrs. Buller?" she said, "I will not stay two minutes; I _must_ hear Duchess. Now, _are_ busy?" "Not all," said Aunt Theresa, midst making her tradesmen's books. "Pray sit down, take bonnet." "It is hardly worth while, I _can't_ stay," said Mrs. O'Connor, taking her bonnet off, setting crush flowers. As Mrs. O'Connor stayed two hours half, Aunt Theresa granted request allowed hear her narrative, I learnt good deal history great-grandmother. CHAPTER VIII. A FAMILY HISTORY. "We really connected," Mrs. Buller began. "She Margery's great-grandmother, Margery I second cousins. That is all. But I knew her long ago, poor cousin Alice married Captain Vandaleur. And I heard whole story again." I heard story also. I listened open mouth Aunt Theresa time, often afterwards questioned her "ancestors," I may almost call them. Years later I used repeat histories girls I with. When good terms interested hear, I proud tell, would say, "Tell us ancestors, Margery." And fell surer method annoying slight memory great-great-grandparents. I told story pretty often. I shall put way, Aunt Theresa told story rather disconnectedly. The de Vandaleurs (we dropped _de_ now) old French family. There Duke killed Revolution '92, family emigrated, poor. The title restored afterwards, property. It went cousin Duke murdered, he surviving children; say went wrong line. The cousin remained France, always managed keep favour ruling powers, got title, remade his fortunes; others remained England, poor proud. They would accepted favours new royal family, still considered deprived rights. One Vandaleur _émigrés_ (the one ought Duke) married his cousin. They suffered great hardships escape, I fancy, birth son, shortly arrival England, wife died. There old woman, Aunt Theresa said, used her nurse she child, London, lived, girl, wretched lodgings poor people came over, she used tell her wonderful stories them. How, her delirium (she insane little time her son born), Madame de Vandaleur fancied herself her old home, "with her finery her," Nurse Brown used say. Nurse Brown seems little sympathy nervous diseases. She could understand broken leg, fever, "when folks kept beds"; disordered fancies brain tried far, mad whims lady could "go about," insisted upon going about, changing her dress two three times day, receiving imaginary visitors, ordering her faithful nurse names half-a-dozen servants she longer possessed, beyond her comprehension. Aunt Theresa said she her brothers sisters deepest pity poor lady. They thought romantic she cry fresh flowers dress herself meet Queen dirty little lodging back Leicester Square, always begging hear "what else she did." But Nurse Brown seems fondest relating smart speeches she endeavoured "put sense into" devoted French servant toiled humour every whim her unhappy mistress, instead "sharp her," Nurse Brown advised. Aunt Theresa doubts whether Mrs. Brown ever make speeches she reported; people say said that, often mean wish said. "If she is mad, I says, shave her head, instead dressing her hair day long. I have knowed mad people foamed mouth rolled eyes, would done injury strait-jacket; I have knowed folks fevers unreasonable enough, kept beds dark room, did not know mothers. Madame's ways beyond me, I says. _You_ calls madness: _I_ calls temper. Tem--per, no--thing else." Aunt Theresa used make us laugh repeating Nurse Brown's sayings, little shake herself she emphasized last sentence. If she sympathy Madame de Vandaleur, she double share poor lady's husband: "a _good_ soul," she used call him. It vain Jeanette spoke sweet temper unselfishness her mistress "before terrible days"; her conduct towards her husband "enough for" Nurse Brown, she said. No sooner poor gentleman gone errand her pleasure she called her, pacified fable Jeanette's devising, always said "the King" summoned Monsieur de Vandaleur. Jeanette well aware that, childless old Duke dead, her master succeeded title, she often spoke Monsieur le Duc his wife, seems pleased poor lady. When he absent, Jeanette's ready excuse, "_Eh, Madame! Pour Monsieur le Duc--le Roi l'a fait appeller_," enough, she waited patiently his return. Ever-changing her whims fancies were, poor gentleman sacrificed everything gratify them. His watch, his rings, his buckles, lace his shirt, trifles secured hasty flight, sold one one. His face familiar keepers certain stalls near Covent Garden Market stands. He bought flowers Madame he could afford food. He sold his waistcoat, buttoned his coat across him--and looked thinner ever. Then day came Madame wished, he could gratify her wish. Everything gone. He said, "This kill me, Jeanette;" Jeanette believed him. Nurse Brown (according her account) assured Jeanette would not. "Folk does not die things, says I." But, spite common-sense experience, Monsieur de Vandaleur die grief, something like it, within twenty-four hours death his wife, birth son. For years faithful Jeanette supported child her industry. She exquisite laundress, she throve Duke Duchess would starved. As boy grew she kept far possible common companions, treated much deference he succeeded family honours, filled his head traditions deserts dignity de Vandaleurs. At last cousin Monsieur de Vandaleur found out. He also exile, he prospered better, got small civil appointment, married Scotch lady. It he come help his young kinsman, I think, old French lady took fancy boy, sent school France her expense. He nineteen she died, left little money she possessed. He returned England, paid his respects his cousin Scotch Mrs. Vandaleur. She congratulated herself, I heard, her child, daughter, home visit paid. Mrs. Janet Vandaleur high-minded, hard-headed, north-country woman. She valued long descent, noble blood, loyalty fallen dynasty like Scotchwoman, but, like Scotchwoman, she also respected capability energy endurance. She combined romantic heart practical head way peculiar her nation. She knew pedigree every family (who pedigree) north Tweed, was, probably, best housekeeper Great Britain. She devoutly believed her husband perfect mortal man may below, whilst separate compartment her brain she keenest sense defects weaknesses he inherited, dreaded nothing see her daughter mated one helpless Vandaleurs. This daughter, much her mother's strong practical capacity, got her father's _physique_ good deal his artistic temperament. Dreading development _de Vandaleur_ qualities her, mother made her education studiously practical orderly. She had, like Scotch matrons her type, good gift telling family stories, high respect ancestral traditions, quite kept herself amusing her daughter's childhood tales de Vandaleur greatness. But her husband discovered his young relative, daughter grew up, she purposely avoided subject, had, probably, sole effect increasing her daughter's interest family romance. Mrs. Janet knew de Vandaleur pedigree well her own, shown miniature late Duke his youth her daughter child many occasions; she also alluded fact title birth undoubtedly exiled branch family. Miss Vandaleur ignorant young gentleman completed his education was, every one rights, Monsieur le Duc; she much disappointed missed seeing her mother glad met. For Bertrand de Vandaleur virtues weaknesses his family intense proportions. He hopeless ignorance value money, his strongest condemnation his Scotch cousin. He high-minded, chivalrous, points accomplished, charming, tender-hearted. But he weak will, merely passive endurance, quite without energy. He graceful, fanciful, almost weak intellect. I mean, bordered mental deficiency; times his dreamy eyes took wildness said make painfully like his mother her last days. He absurd gracefully romantic idea his family consequence. He handsome, like miniature late Duke. It desirable his cousin meet him, especially she sentimental age seventeen. So Mrs. Janet Vandaleur hastened return London small property Scotland. But law hinder Monsieur de Vandaleur making Scotch tour. One summer's afternoon, she finished making preserves, Miss Vandaleur strolled little wood behind house towards favourite beck ran gorge below. She singing old French song praise beauty fair lady de Vandaleurs olden time. As she finished first verse, voice short distance took refrain-- "Victoire de Vandaleur! Victoire! Victoire!" It her name well her ancestress, she blushed her eyes met strange young gentleman, sketch-book his hand, French poodle his heels. "Place aux dames!" said stranger. On white poodle sat up, his master bowed till his head nearly touched ground. They met children, introduction enough circumstances. Here, last, Victoire, embodiment her dreams de Vandaleur race. He personally like miniature, he might old Duke. He young one, even her mother allowed. For him, he found companion whose birth jar his aristocratic prejudices, whose strong character bone marrow his weak one. Before reached house Mrs. Janet's precautions vain. She grew fond lad spite herself. The romantic side her sympathized his history. He orphan, she mother's heart. In direct line he Duke, she Scotchwoman. He freely consented settle every penny he upon his wife, and, his mother-in-law justly remarked, "Many cannier man would not done that." In fine, young people married usual difficulties beforehand. He nineteen, she seventeen. They great-grandfather great-grandmother. They one child--a son. They poor, yet gave good education. I ought say, _she_ gave him, everything needed effort energy done great-grandmother. The became evident her Bertrand de Vandaleur less helpful practical Bertrand de Vandaleur him, seems developed her purpose capability inherited Mrs. Janet. Like many another poor ambitious mother, she studied Latin Greek algebra she might teach her son. And time she saved, even small income. She began "put by" boy's birth his education, time came he sent school. My grandfather well. I heard he inherited his father's beauty, without his mother's sense energy. He de Vandaleur quality pleasing, weakness utterly ruled woman he loved. At twenty he married heiress. His parents married early reasonable ground complaint this; he left his Church his wife, came terrible breach son. His mother soon forgave him; father immovable his displeasure weak people sometimes be. Happily, however, birth grandson peace made, young husband brought his wife visit his parents. The heiress property West Indies, proposed visit, remained old people till sailed. It keepsake parting grandfather restored his mother watch she gave me. The child left England his mother's relations. My grandfather grandmother never returned. They among countless victims cruel seas. The vessel went lost week storms. On day night, part Atlantic, one survived tell. Their orphan child dear father. CHAPTER IX. HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS--DREAMS AND DAY DREAMS--THE VINE--ELSPETH--MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER. My father brought chiefly his mother's relations. The religious question always difficulty regarded de Vandaleurs, I fancy extended case. My guardians great-grandparents, Major Buller, Mr. Arkwright, clergyman Church England. My great-grandfather great-grandmother Roman Catholics. Though appointed guardians, nearest relations, great-grandmother held her little hand towards side pony-carriage said, "You let child come me? Soon, soon?" Major Buller taken her hand his, replied cordially, "Of course, dear madam, course. Whenever convenient Mr. de Vandaleur." And promise stirred heart flutter happy expectation I felt since I persuaded father promise I dine him, alone, like grown-up lady, sad birthday he died. It perhaps useless try find reasons fancy I took "Duchess"--as Aunt Theresa called her--since allowed she fascinated every one came near her. With bright qualities made her admirable herself, she combined gracious art putting people ease themselves; and, remembering sore wounds child's self-love are, I think her kindness must skilful make forgive folly looking-glass enough forget admiration her. Like children, I given hero heroine worship. I admired one lady Aunt Theresa's acquaintance, fascinated others I know, seen church, longed time I also longer trip short simple skirts, tie curls ribbon, sweep grandly languidly parade service, bury half pew festoons furbelows silk dress velvet trimmings, sink nest matchless millinery Litany, scent air patchouli I rose hymn, examine ladies' bonnets one eyeglasses supposed make longer rude stare, fan fatigues service sermon. But even dignity grown-updom embellished pretty faces splendid costumes stir imagination stirred sight great-grandmother history her life. It like seeing princess fairy tale one's eyes. The faces fine ladies I envied little apt insipid expression, pass memory; great-grandmother's quick, bright, earnest face easily forgotten. I made mind I grew I would wear large _chignon_ all, bonnet full flowers, dress full flounces, rather short skirt buckled shoes grey curls, big hat many bows, green satin driving-cloak lined fur. How one, blessed grown-up freedom choice, could submit driven coach-man big carriage, highly stuffed uninteresting first-class railway carriage, possible drive one's self sort toy-cart dear white pony shaggy dog, I could understand. I well knew I choose, I thought much I remember dreaming great-grandmother presented pony chaise counterpart her own. The dream-joy acquisition, pride driving Bullers' door offering take Matilda expedition, marred one freaks spoil pleasure many dreams. Just Matilda appeared, full gratitude, picnic luncheon basket, I became conscious I night-gown, forgotten dress. Again I tried go back dream put suitable clothes. I never accomplished it, woke effort. In sober daylight I indulged hope Mrs. Vandaleur would give carriage pony own, I hope I go ever I went stay her. Perhaps sometimes alone, driving myself, rosy-cheeked Adolphe open gates deliver unexpected difficulties reins. But I dreamed many day-dream possible delights store new-found relatives, almost counted hours Duchess's watch till she send me. As happened, however, circumstances combined little time hinder visiting great-grandmother. The little Bullers I measles; convalescent, Major Buller got two months' leave, went away change air. Then small-pox prevailed Riflebury, kept away, even Major Buller returned his duties. When return, visit Vandaleurs could arranged, Adolphe fell ill scarlet fever, fear contagion postponed visit time. I eight years old I went stay The Vine. This name little cottage great-grandparents lived--so called old vine covered south wall one side porch, crept framework upon roof. I remember many pounds grapes known produce one season, yet I ought forgotten, subject great-grandfather, great-grandmother, Adolphe, Elspeth constantly boasted. "And do not ripen master says France, it is best," said Elspeth; "for ripe grapes would picked along, house penny better them. But green-grape tarts cream eating king." Elspeth "general servant" great-grandmother's. Her aunt Mary come Scotland serve "Miss Victoire" she first married. As Mary's health failed, she grew old, her young niece sent work her. Old Mary died her hands great-grandmother's, Elspeth reigned her stead. Elspeth elderly woman I first made her acquaintance. She broad, bright, sensible face, kindly smile her. She wore frilled caps, tied her chin; exchanging "the fly-away bits things servants stick heads present time," Elspeth would soon thought abandoning faith her fathers. She strict bitter Presbyterian. She tall, she broad; her apparent width increased broad linen collars spread, almost like cape, her ample shoulders. My great-grandmother anecdote connected this, she fond relating. "And think Elspeth, little one?" she said first evening visit. "I think she is big," reply. "Certainly, good Elspeth wide she tall," said great-grandfather, laughing. I wondered so; great-grandmother gave little yard-measure wooden castle, taken fancy among treasures her work-box, idea seized measuring Elspeth satisfaction point. But silken measure slipped, caught battlements castle, I lost place counting figures, last fain ask Elspeth herself. "How tall you, Elspeth, please? As much yard?" "Ou aye, dear," said Elspeth, deeply engaged darning large hole one great-grandfather's socks. "As much two yards?" I inquired. "Eh, no, dearie," said Elspeth. "That wad six feet; I am tall, though father six feet six inches." "How broad you, Elspeth, please?" I persisted. "As much yard?" "I am thinking I be, dear," said Elspeth, "for takes full width coloured cotton cut dress-front, it is over-big." "Are broad two yards, think?" I said, drawing ribbon full length castle, considering question. Elspeth shook her head. She biting end piece darning-cotton; I rightly concluded she would confess two yards wide. "Please, I measured Elspeth," I announced tea-table, "and grandpapa quite right." "Eh?" said Mr. Vandaleur, trick requiring observations repeated his wife. "She says she measured Elspeth, right," said great-grandmother. "But grandpapa right, little one?" "Grandpapa said Elspeth wide she tall," I explained. "And she is, I measured her--at least, ribbon would slip I measured her, I asked her; she is yard tall, much two yards; yard wide, much two yards. And grandpapa right." Some happiest hours I spent The Vine spent Elspeth's company. I made tiny cakes, tarts curious shapes, she busy pastry-making, clear-starching doll's account Elspeth "getting-up" great-grandfather's cravats. Elspeth strong old-fashioned notions paying respect due. She gave Adolphe sharp lecture one day lack respect his manner "Miss Margery"; and, hand, she taught curtsy door I breakfasted Mr. Mrs. Vandaleur. Some dancing lessons I Riflebury helped here, Elspeth well satisfied performance. I felt shy awkward first time I made morning curtsy, knees shaking me, Elspeth watching passage; great-grandfather mother seemed take matter course, I soon became quite used it. If Mr. Vandaleur happened standing room, he always returned curtsy low bow. I became fond great-grandfather. He tall, handsome old man, high shoulders, slightly bent age also habit. He wore blue coat brass buttons, well made long time ago; white trousers, light waistcoat, frilled shirt, stiff cravat. On wall drawing-room hung water-colour portrait young handsome man, longish wavy hair, features refined weakness, dreamy, languid eyes, coat image great-grandfather's. The picture hung near door; Mr. Bertrand Vandaleur passed out, I well remember he almost always glanced sketch, people glance passing mirror. I young notice proof drawing portrait himself; I remember much struck likeness coat picture great-grandfather wore, also way hair thrown back high, narrow forehead, great-grandfather's grey hairs combed away his brow. Children great admirers beauty too, especially, I think, effeminate style good looks, susceptible power expression faces. I romantic admiration "the handsome man door," his eyes haunted room. I kneeling chair examining sketch one morning, great-grandfather came me, "Who it, little one?" said he. I looked picture. I looked great-grandfather's coat. As his eyes gazed steadily mine, likeness also; coat decided me. I said, "It you, grandpapa." I think little incident sealed friendship. I always remained high favour great-grandfather. He spent great deal his time painting. He never had, I believe, profession. The small income he his wife lived private fortune. I often think must great trial woman great-grandmother's energy, her husband made effort add resources work kind. But I cannot think profession would suited him. He sadly wanting general capacity, though accomplished much average, fine knack budding roses. I thought grandest gentleman ever lived, pleasantest companions. His weak lovable nature strong sympathy children, I think. I ought say, child; he would share fancies humours one child companion hours, quite incapable managing larger number--as, indeed, he kind domestic administration control. Mrs. Vandaleur emphatically Elspeth's mistress, she also her friend; absence "the mistress" Elspeth ruled "the master" rod iron. I quickly gained degree power myself. I discovered I maintained certain outward forms respect courtesy, shock grandpapa's standard good manners, I might make almost demands his patience good-nature. Children pet animals make discoveries quickly, apt use power somewhat tyrannically. I fear I exception rule. CHAPTER X. THOMAS THE CAT--MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S SKETCHES--ADOLPHE IS MY FRIEND--MY GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER DISTURBS MY REST--I LEAVE THE VINE. My great-grandfather had, I said, skill painting. He gifted intense sense of, love for, colour. I sure he saw colours people not. What common eyes mass grey, green, pleasant combination many gay delicate hues. He distinguished severally innumerable bright threads Nature's coat many colours, simple truth I think separate joy him. He white Persian cat artistic temperament, followed his walks, dozed back his arm-chair, condescended share his tea reached certain moderate temperature. It never betrayed excitement, except fish dinner. My great-grandfather's fasts feasts Thomas cat. I clearly remember sight great-grandfather pacing slowly tiny garden The Vine, his hands behind him, followed sedately Thomas. Now he would stop gaze, infinite contentment his eyes, delicate blue-grey mist behind leafless trees (which spring sunshine were, doubt, much complex beautiful colour mere brown), drinking blue scillas border sigh satisfaction. When he paused, Thomas would pause; he feasted his eyes, Thomas would rub his head his master's legs, stretch his own. When Elspeth cooked fish, great-grandmother made tea arranged flowers table, would come together condescend breakfasts, air responsibility life find sunny spots enjoy themselves. My great-grandfather's charming paintings sketches flowers. Ordinary stiff flower-paintings paintings uninteresting, I think; his different kind. Each sketch sort idyll. Indeed, he would tell stories he showed them. Long great-grandfather lived, he never robust man, Elspeth's chief ideas subject his sketches bore reference colds he caught, illnesses he induced, sitting east winds lying damp grass sketch. "That will one master he laid rheumatics," Elspeth said, I described one favourites her. It spring sketch. My great-grandfather lain face downwards lawn it. This bring his eyes level subject his painting, this: crocus exquisite shades lilac seen varieties, full-blown, standing first beauty freshness fringe narrow silver-striped leaves. The portrait opaque polished-looking painting smooth cardboard, sketch--indefinite outer edges whole subject--on water-colour paper moderate roughness. The throat part cup flower stood shadow roots plant beyond; shadow infinite gradation, quite without blackness common patches shade seen untrained eyes. From level great-grandfather's view, he lay grass, border looked mere strip; close behind hedge dividing garden field. Just crocus gap hedge, sketch indicated rather drawn. And round corner bare thorn branches hedge-bank field peeped celandine daisy. They nearly finished portraits crocus. A telling strokes colour made them, gave life pertness clever enough. Beneath sketch written, "La Demoiselle. Des enfants du village la regardent." My great-grandfather translated me, used show "little peasants," Marguerite Celandine, peeping pretty young lady her mauve dress striped violet. But every sketch story, often moral; not, rule, original one. In one, lovely study ivy crept rotten branch upon ground. A crimson toadstool relieved heavy green, suggested year drawing close. Beneath written, "Charity." "Thus," said great-grandfather, "one covers hides defects one he loves." A study gaudy summer tulips stood--as may guessed--for Pride. "Pride," said great-grandfather, "is sin; mortal sin, dear child. Moreover, foolish, also vulgar--the pride fine clothes, money, equipages, like. What called pride birth--the dignity ancient name--this, indeed, another thing. It petty, personal; seems like patriotism--the pride country." I best describe Elspeth sketch great-grandfather's commentary. "A' pride's sinful," said Elspeth decidedly. "Pride wealth, pride birth. Not I am objecting decent satisfaction body's gude conduct respectability. Pride character, that is anither thing a'thegither, respectit." My great-grandfather gave paints, his directions I daubed away, much content. When I struggling hopelessly perspective pansies various colours (for imitation I painted flowers), he would say, "Never mind shape, dear Marguerite, get colour--the colour, child!" And he trained quickness perception colour certainly common age. I spent many pleasant hours, too, less intellectual society Adolphe. He dug bed bit spare ground, shaped like heart. He laboured constantly heart, making plump piling earth, cramming plants various kinds--perennials much want subdivision, often full bloom--which he brought cottage gardens "folk he knew," watered copiously "sattle  them." His real name Adolphe, Thomas. As this, however, created confusion cat, great-grandmother named afresh, retainer de Vandaleurs days gone by, whose faithful service tradition family. I happy The Vine--by day. I feel ashamed recall miserable I night, yet I know I could help it. In old times I always accustomed watched sleep Ayah. After I came Aunt Theresa, I slept room one children. At The Vine, first time, I slept alone. This all. It merely alone dark frightened me. Indeed, curious little wick floating cup oil lighted night benefit, illumined great source terror made night hideous me. Some French refugee artist, indebted great-grandparents kindness, shown his gratitude painting picture execution Duc de Vandaleur perished Revolution, great-grandfather model. It wretched daub, subject none less horrible that, caricatured likeness great-grandfather make seem less real pleasant. That execution never over, ghastly head never found rest grave, awful-looking man was, yet not, Grandpapa--haunted me. They certain horrible dreams, I remember quite clearly day I dreamed last night, I know I shall never forget. The dreams associated picture, fears grew instead lessening time went by. Very late one night Elspeth came found awake, probably looking far happy. I nothing say myself, I burst tears. Elspeth tenderness itself, she got hold wrong idea. I "just homesick," she thought, needed "away home again," "bairns like myself." I know I never explained real reason distress--children apt reticent occasions. I think panic seized upon members household, old make child happy. I constantly assured "it natural," I "had good." But I sent back Riflebury. No one knew loth I leave, still less much older relative The Vine I owed expulsion--to great-great-great-grandfather--Monsieur le Duc de Vandaleur. Thomas, cat, purred loudly I withdrew, I think he glad rid me. Adolphe alone verdict household, I think believed I would preferred remain. "I am sure I thought quite sattled, miss," he said, he saw off; he blubbered like baby. His transplanted perennials "sattled" copious floods water. Perhaps he hoped tears would settle me! CHAPTER XI. MATILDA'S NEWS--OUR GOVERNESS--MAJOR BULLER TURNED TUTOR--ELEANOR ARKWRIGHT. The grief I felt leaving The Vine greatly forgotten warm welcome awaited return Riflebury. In household gossip principal amusement, return member visit matter general congratulation till new budget exhausted. Indeed, I plead guilty liking first skim news Eleanor one boys comes back visit, present time. Matilda withdrew Aunt Theresa soon she could. "I glad get back, Margery dear," said she. "And must tell news, I will tell mine. And begin with--what think?--we have got governess, I little room head stairs ourselves." Matilda's news lengthy enough interesting enough make us late tea, mine kept us awake couple hours fairly two little iron bedsteads room own. That say, I told I tell came bed, news tame compared Matilda's soon returned discussion hers. I tried describe great-grandfather's sketches, neither Aunt Theresa drawing-room, Matilda retired night, seemed feel interest subject; Mrs. Buller asked sort people called The Vine, I felt reply was, like rest news, dull. Matilda's, contrary, entertaining. She spoke enthusiastically Miss Perry, governess. "She good-natured, Margery, cannot think. When lessons she takes walks Esplanade, she calls her dear Matilda, I take her arm, she tells herself. She says she knows she is romantic. And she is got lots secrets, she is told several already; she says she feeling I keep secret, I can. But telling you's telling, know, she is sure tell herself; you would better wait till she say anything, fear she vexed." Of course I promised so, craned neck bed catch Matilda's interesting whispered revelations. Matilda herself partially Miss Perry's confidence, I looked anxiously forward time she would admit also her secrets, though I feared she might consider young. My fears groundless, I found Miss Perry fond talking herself, suitable audience quite secondary consideration her. She _protégée_ Mrs. Minchin's, persuaded Aunt Theresa take her governess. She quite unfit position, little harm us her brief reign. But I think interests entered least Mrs. Minchin's calculations matter. She "taken Miss Perry up," get Miss Perry comfortable home her sole object. To new governess justice, she her best impart her superficial acquirements us. We plodded regularly French exercises, she corrected key, she kept us work given number hours day; tatting sides practised scales, roasting her petticoats fire, whilst Matilda I read Mrs. Markham's _England_ Mrs. Trimmer's _Bible Lessons_ aloud turns full-stops. But lessons Miss Perry quite glad were, subjects studies little holiday hours Sunday sermon rest week. She great novel-reader, I think good many things she told us of, happened herself, real origin Riflebury circulating library. For she one strange characters indulge egotism exaggeration, till seem positively lose sense fact fiction. She filled poor empty little heads great deal folly, well us her reign long one. She much attached school-room fireside. She could sit close it, roast herself thoroughly her satisfaction. I sometimes wondered bony woman kept library ever complained curled condition backs books Miss Perry held her eyes hot coals many hours. In highly heated state governess was, course, sensitive smallest inlet cooler air, "draughts" accordingly her abhorrence. How contrived distinguish verb noun, committed anything whatever memory fever-heat "stuffy" atmosphere little room sacred studies, I know. At certain degree thermometer Miss Perry's face rises makes brain spin even now. This was, doubt, one severe headaches Matilda became subject time, though, I look back, I think she quite strong since measles. They apt end fainting condition, she recovered lying floor. Then, Miss Perry happened good humour, she would excuse Matilda lessons, invariably adding, her "mystery" voice--"But word mamma!" It unjustifiable use she made influence she gained us (especially poor Matilda, fond her, believed her) she magnified her favours expense Major Buller aunt. For time doubts wisdom Mrs. Minchin's choice. Miss Perry clever enough display her romantic side Mrs. Buller. She amused her, too, Riflebury gossip, she adept. She knew equally well far she might venture Major; sleight-of-hand she threw needlework novel Aunt Theresa came school-room skilful way she turned tail bit scandal remark upon weather Uncle Buller opened drawing-room door. But Miss Perry skilful enough win Major's lasting favour. He always slow interfere domestic matters, he unobservant. "I am sure see great deal one would think, Edward," Aunt Theresa would say; "although wrapt insects things." "The insects do not get eyes, dear," said Major Buller. "And hear too," Mrs. Buller continued. "Mrs. O'Connor saying day often seem hear things people, though talk little." "It is, perhaps, I always talking I hear. But Mrs. O'Connor likely think that," said Major, rather severely. He neither blind deaf reference Miss Perry, she dismissed. Aunt Theresa rather dreaded Mrs. Minchin's indignation matter, I believe; needlessly, Miss Perry Mrs. Minchin quarrelled time, Mrs. Minchin much information Miss Perry's disadvantage her fingers' ends, seemed wonderful she ever recommended her. For little time education progressed desultory fashion. Major Buller became perversely prejudiced governesses, short time undertook carry English lessons himself. He made sums amusing, geography lessons "as good stories," though latter often led (by interesting channels) his dearly beloved insects, Mrs. Buller accused making lessons excuse getting his "collection." With "grammar" less successful. Major Buller good teacher he brought intelligence possessed, led us constantly ask questions anything failed understand. In arithmetic led his helping us difficulties; geography led, sooner later, "collection"; English grammar led stumbling-blocks confusion, and, finally, Major's throwing book across room, refusing pursue part education further. "I never learnt English grammar," said Major, "and it is quite evident I cannot teach it." "If _you_ do not know grammar, Papa, _we_ need not," said Matilda promptly, neat disposition, she picked book proceeded put away. "I never said I did not know grammar," said Major; "I fancy I speak write grammatically, I know I got Latin grammar. And, upon soul," added Uncle Buller, pulling his heavy moustache, "I do not know should not same." The idea learning Latin pleased us greatly, Major Buller (who Charterhouse his boyhood) bought copy Dr. Russell's _Grammar_, set work. And either rules Latin grammar bore explanation better English ones, Major Buller better able explain them, difficulties. We proud lessons circumstances, boasted Latin, I remember, little St. Quentins, met dancing-class. The St. Quentins slender, ladylike girls, much alike, rendered exact similarity costume. Their governess charming talented woman, Mrs. St. Quentin proposed Matilda I share her daughters' French lessons Miss Airlie, Major Buller Aunt Theresa thankfully accepted offer. I think short association excellent lady went far cure us silly fancies tricks vulgar gossip gleaned Miss Perry. So matters went months, much Matilda's satisfaction, letter guardian changed plans more. Mr. Arkwright's daughter going school. He wrote ask Bullers let her break journey spending night house. It long journey, she coming north. "They live Yorkshire," said Major Buller, much one might speak living Central Africa. Matilda I looked forward great interest Miss Arkwright's arrival. Her name, learnt, Eleanor, she nearly year older Maria. "She will _your_ friend, I suppose," I said, little enviously, reference her age. "Of course," said Matilda, dignity. "But us good deal," she kind enough add. I remember quite well disappointed I felt I little title share newcomer's friendship. "If she ten years old, come us," I thought, "she would much mine Matilda's." I little thought manner friends spite five years' difference age. Indeed, Matilda I destined see her expected. Aunt Theresa Major Buller came sudden resolution send us also school she going, though hear first. Long afterwards, together, Eleanor asked I could remember first impression her. For affection's sake I wish picturesque one; truth obliges confess that, visitor last arrive, Matilda I chiefly struck fact she wore thick boots, wear crinoline. And yet, looking back, I clear picture her mind, standing passage her box (a rough one, strongly corded, addressed clearest handwriting), purse hand, paying cabman perfect self-possession. An upright, quite ladylike, rather old-fashioned little figure, somewhat quaint simplicity her dress. She rather quaint face, too, nose slightly turned up, prominent forehead, charming mouth, beautiful dark eyes. Her hair rolled tied top her head, odd tendency go astray parting. This was, perhaps, partly trick she seemed her hair away looking-glass. She stood it, also (on one leg) put her shoes stockings, amused us. But she always her feet, seemed unhappy she sat idle. We took her walk morning her arrival, walked faster ever walked keep pace new friend, strode along her thick boots undistended skirts step like kilted Highlander. When came town, however, she quite willing pause shop-windows, gave her much entertainment. "I am afraid I always looking windows I lived town," she said, "there pretty things." Eleanor laughs I remind her walk, stood still every chemist's door she liked smell. When anything interested her, she stopped, times she walked she road given place, determined good time; perhaps would say she walked walking pleasure her. It walking--not strolling. When she alone, I know she constantly ran people would walked. It north-country habit, I think. I seen middle-aged Scotch Yorkshire ladies run lightly children. It fashionable time day, could not, walk, show Eleanor chief characters Riflebury. But leaving High Street she stopped asked, "Who lady?" "The one mauve silk?" said Matilda. "That one cavalry ladies. All cavalry ladies dress grandly." It Mrs. Perowne. She sailing languidly side street, large crinoline, long dress pale silk, floated her along dirty pavement, much, I remember, admiration. Above tight-fitting thing good deal lace it, crowned fragile flowery bonnet, tuft white lace end white stick sheltered her nose, aquiline, sunshine. She prettily dressed open carriage, flower-show, wedding breakfast; walking streets small, dirty town, change her books library, her costume ludicrously place, though time I thought enviably grand. The way rich skirt would wash, would undoubtedly worn again, trailed dust orange-peel, greengrocers' refuse, general shop-sweepings, offensive cleanliness alone. "Is she ill?" Eleanor asked. "No," said Matilda; "I do not think so. Why?" "She walks slowly," said Eleanor, gazing anxiously Mrs. Perowne her dark eyes, "and she white face." "Oh, dear!" said Matilda, laughing, "that is puff--puff, white veil. It is make her look young. I heard Mrs. Minchin tell Mamma she knew she thirty-seven least. But she dresses splendidly. If stay Sunday, you will see her close, she sits front us church. And she splendid big scent-bottle, gold tops, lovely, tiny little prayer-book, bound blue velvet, watch bigger shilling, monogram back. She took several times sermon last Sunday, I saw it. But is not her hair funny?" "It is beautiful colour," said Eleanor, "only looks different front. But I suppose that is veil." "No, is not," said Matilda; "that is new colour hair, know. It is done stuff put on; Miss Perry said worst was, did not always come over. Lots ladies use it." "How horrid!" said Eleanor. "But makes her walk slow?" "Well, I do not know," said Matilda. "Why she walk quick?" Eleanor seemed struck reply, minutes' pause, said gently, slight blush her cheeks, "I am afraid I walking fast you. I am used walking boys." We earnestly assured her case, much better fun walk her Miss Perry, used dawdle often thoroughly chilled. In afternoon took her Esplanade, Matilda, her knowledge people, took lead conversation. I proud walk side new friend, best doll arms. Aunt Theresa came us, she soon sat chat friend, three strolled together. I remember pretty bit trimming Eleanor's hat blown wind her face, she quietly seized it, stuffed securely band. "Oh, dear!" said Matilda, emphatic tone Aunt Theresa's lady visitors will not exclaim nothing particular--"do not that. It looks pretty; you are crushing _dreadfully_." "It got eyes," said Eleanor briefly. "I hate tags." We went home Aunt Theresa, stood near door, Eleanor lingered looked wistfully road, ran slight hill towards open country. "Would like stay little longer?" politely asked. "I rather like go top hill," said Eleanor. "Do not think flat ground tires one? Shall race up?" she added. We willingly agreed. I yards start Eleanor, Matilda rather less, away went. But little used running, hoops thin boots favour. Eleanor beat us, course. She seemed way struck view top. Indeed particularly pretty. "It is flat here," she said. "There big hills get top of, I suppose?" We confessed not, and, nothing do, ran again, went indoors. Eleanor dressed evening her usual peripatetic way, and, armed homely-looking piece grey knitting, followed us down-stairs. Her superabundant energy seem find vent conversation. We confidential enough tell homes, she sat long demurely silent, Matilda ventured upon inquiry-- "Do not talk much home?" "Oh yes," said Eleanor--"at least, we have anything say;" I sure irony intended reply. "What knitting, dear?" said Aunt Theresa. "A pair socks brother Jack," answer. "I am sure you are dreadfully industrious," said Mrs. Buller. A little later she begged Eleanor put away. "You will tire eyes, dear, I am sure; pray rest little chat us." "I do not look knitting," said Eleanor; she put away, sat looking rather red face, somewhat encumbered her empty hands, red too. I think Uncle Buller noticed this; he told us get big scrap-book show Miss Arkwright. Eleanor got cool book; she said little till, pausing small, black-looking print sheet full rather coarse coloured caricatures, cuttings illustrated papers old-fashioned books, second-rate lithographs, third-rate original sketches, fitted close patchwork, she gave sort half-repressed cry. "My dear! What it?" cried Matilda effusively. "I think," said Eleanor, looking information Aunt Theresa, "I think it is real Rembrandt, is not it?" "A real what, dear?" said Mrs. Buller. "One Rembrandt's etchings," said Eleanor; "and course I do not know, I think must original; it is beautifully done, mother copy one. We know copy, I think must original, things turned way; it is old, it is beautifully done," Eleanor repeated, her face little black print. Major Buller came across room, sat her. "You fond drawing?" he said. "Very," said Eleanor, she threw good deal eloquence one word. The Major she forthwith plunged discussion drawing, etching, line-engraving, &c., &c. It appeared Mrs. Arkwright etched copper, good collection old etchings, Eleanor familiar. It also transpired she naturalist, led easy stages promise Major show Eleanor his insects. They talked till bedtime, Aunt Theresa bade us good-night, she said: "I am glad you have found voice, dear;" she added, laughing, "But whenever Papa talks anybody, always ends collection." CHAPTER XII. POOR MATILDA--THE AWKWARD AGE--MRS. BULLER TAKES COUNSEL WITH HER FRIENDS--THE "MILLINER AND MANTUAMAKER"--MEDICAL ADVICE--THE MAJOR DECIDES. It Major Buller's high opinion Miss Airlie way lowered he decided send us school. In fact long heavy pressure, circumstances well Aunt Theresa, he gave his consent plan never quite met his approval. Several things time seemed conspire effect it. The St. Quentins going long leave, Miss Airlie would go them. This heavy blow. Then heard school Miss Airlie left Riflebury, fact opportune (so Aunt Theresa said) "quite providential." If go school, sending us one would save trouble making personal inquiries, perhaps less wise selection, Major Buller confidence Mr. Arkwright's good judgment. The ladies whose care his daughter confided probably fit teach us. "It would save great deal trouble," guardian confessed, must also confessed Major Buller glad avoid trouble he could conscientiously so. I think his warm approval Eleanor finally clinched question. He thought she would good companion poor Matilda. Why I speak her "poor Matilda" demands explanation. Before I attempt give I must say one respect biographies must always less satisfactory story one might invent. When putting true things friends, cannot divide people neatly good bad, injurers injured, writing tale head. The story seems complete able either lay blame melancholy events shoulders unworthy character, show natural punishment sufferer's misconduct. But thinking Matilda Aunt Theresa Major Buller, even Doctor Mrs. Buller's lady friends, possible. The morbid condition--of body mind--into Matilda fell time light misfortune either regards her sufferings discomfort produced household, I afraid she mismanaged fault herself. It safe, rate, take blame one's share, I often thought, bitterness spirit, that, child I was, I might forbearing helpful Matilda time her temper much tried ill-health untoward circumstances. We good many squabbles period. I piqued upon generally right, I think then, I now, possible right quarrel, time least blame it. Matilda certainly degrees become irritable, moody, perverse, her perversity developed ways puzzled poor Aunt Theresa. She became silent unsociable. She displayed particular dislike privileges drawing-room grown-up "company," accompanying Aunt Theresa she paid her afternoon calls. She looked ill, stoutly denied she so. She highly resented solicitude subject her health, fought obstinately every bottle medicine, positively rude doctors. For her unsociability, I think, Miss Perry's evil influence partly blame. Poor Matilda clung her belief late governess she us text upon Aunt Theresa her friends preached governesses general, governesses suffered particular. Our lessons Major Buller, influence Miss Airlie's good breeding straightforward kindness, gave healthier turn tastes; Miss Airlie went away Major Buller proclaimed three weeks' holiday Latin grammar, left ourselves, Matilda felt want flattery, patronage, small excitements mysteries nothing, Miss Perry accustomed her. I blush think companionship less comfort her ought been. As Aunt Theresa, she always busy give full attention anything; invite confidence. Another reason, I sure, Matilda's dislike appearing company painful sense her personal appearance; she heard Aunt Theresa her friends discuss, approve, condemn friends standard appearances alone, ever since she old enough overhear company conversation, I hardly think she much blame point. Matilda emphatically called "an awkward age"; age awkward girls others. I wish grown-up ladies, mean kind friends' daughters, would try remember awkwardness it, increase naturally uncomfortable self-consciousness personal remarks might disturb composure older, prettier, better-dressed people. It bad enough quite well aware size one's hands feet prematurely foreshadow future growth one's figure; prominent simple dresses unintroduced young lady seem perpetually receding one's bony-wrists above, shrinking towards calves one's legs below, thin ankles one impelled stand turns (like sleeping stork) mysterious instinct relieving weak overgrown spine. This, I say, mortifying enough, modesty good breeding carry us cheerfully unfelt contrast assured manners flowing draperies Mamma's lady friends drawing-room, might spare us announcement hardly needs gold eyeglasses discover--that really grow every day. Blushes come heavily enough hands cheeks shyness youth added glows chills imperfect circulation: need stare strangers, apologies Mamma, stain doubtful complexions deeper red. All girls awkward awkward age. I speak disinterestedly Matilda's behalf, I never went phase myself. It perhaps I small I never remember hands, part me, feeling way; clothes--of whatever length, breadth, fashion--always happy knack becoming one wise I could comfortably forget them. The St. Quentin girls nearer Matilda's age I, happy looked nice hobble-de-hoy stage girlhood. I sure much preferred company young brothers company drawing-room; told do, seemed happy it. They had, however, several advantages Matilda. By judicious care (for naturally robust) kept good health. They kept great many pets, always seemed plenty do, perhaps kept worrying themselves. Adelaide, instance, flowers drawing-room dinner-table. Mrs. St. Quentin said she could well herself. They small garden pick from, Adelaide used lots wild-flowers grass ferns. She often let help her fill china jars, she person ever seemed like hearing Grandpapa's paintings. They something house. But I believe greatest advantage poor Matilda accustomed hear dress appearance talked matters first importance, whatever defects felt conscious either weigh heavily minds. On poor Matilda's weighed heavily indeed. And she troubled consciousness plain, I think quite many girls affected vanity pretty (and received far less attention moralists); she also tormented certain purely nervous fancies her face swollen, her eyes squinting, her throat choking, people looked her, due ill-health. Unhappily, ill-health good excuse Matilda's unwillingness "play pretty" drawing-room subject she perverse other. It great pity she frank confiding her mother. The detestable trick small concealments Miss Perry taught us partly answerable this; fault entirely Matilda's. Aunt Theresa time attend her. What attention she give, however, made her anxious subject she took counsel every lady her acquaintance, she talked poor Matilda's condition less leisure she think it. "It may mind body, I am afraid," said Aunt Theresa one afternoon, return visiting Matilda refused share. "Mrs. Minchin says she knew girl went her senses she two years older Matilda, began her refusing go anywhere see one." Major Buller turned round his chair anxious face, beetle transfixed needle his hand. "It shocking thing," continued Aunt Theresa, taking her bonnet; "for she great-uncle Hanwell, her grandfather cut his throat. I suppose family." Major Buller turned back again, pinned beetle proper label. "I suppose was," said he dryly; "but insanity family I am aware of, Mrs. Minchin's case much point." "Mrs. O'Connor will not believe she is ill," sighed Aunt Theresa; "_she_ thinks it is temper. She says her temper unbearable till she knocked her school." "Matilda's temper good enough till lately," growled Major. "She says Dr. O'Connor's brother, medical officer lunatic asylum somewhere Tipperary," continued Aunt Theresa, "declares mad women go minds ill-temper. He is written book it." "Heaven defend me, mind body, theories astute practitioner!" said Uncle Buller piously. "It is well making fun it, everybody tells one girls trouble number boys. I am sure I do not remember giving mother particular trouble I Matilda's age, stories I have heard to-day enough make one's hair stand end. Mrs. Minchin knew another girl, lost her appetite like Matilda, she sulky temper too, last found she used eat black-beetles. She Creole, something sort, I believe, could not stop her. The Minchins knew her West Indies, he 209th; or, least, heard her. The houses swarmed black-beetles." "A useful young lady," said Uncle Buller. "Does Matilda dine native beetles, dear? She has not touched humble collection." "Oh, make fun everything----" Aunt Theresa began; moment Mrs. St. John announced. After customary civilities, Aunt Theresa soon began talk poor Matilda, Mrs. St. John entered warmly subject. To ladies regiment justice, sympathized freely other's domestic troubles; indeed lack taking counsel domestic troubles all. "Girls good deal difficult manage boys, I am afraid," sighed Aunt Theresa, repeating Mrs. O'Connor's _dictum_. "Women _dreadful_ creatures age," said Mrs. St. John Major, opening her brown eyes way she always she talking gentleman. "I always _longed_ man." [Eleanor says she hates hear girls say wish boys. If wish it, I see say so. But one thing always struck odd. If meet woman incomparably silly, know art trade she could keep herself starvation, could manage account-books village shop, unpunctual, unreasoning, every respect uneducated--a woman, short, has, one would think, daily reason thankful her necessities supplied people, she pretty sure always regretting she man. Another, trick silly ladies _riles_ (as say Yorkshire) far odd ambition responsibilities one quite incompetent assume. Mrs. St. John it, generally displayed benefit gentlemen, seem rule susceptible flattery, I suppose kind drawing-room "pretty talk" expression deliberate opinions. It consists contrasting girls boys women men, disparagement former, especially matters circumstances natural disposition commonly supposed give advantage. I remember hearing fat, good-natured girl one Aunt Theresa's garden-parties say, impressiveness full conviction, "Girls far cruel boys, really. You know, women _much_ cruel men--oh, I am _sure_ are!" idea filled less amazement horror. This young lady good-natured us. She reputation unselfish much-beloved elder sister. I think she would hurt fly. Why she said I cannot imagine, unless please young gentleman she talking to. I think he look rather gratified. For part, idea worried little head long time--children give much heed general propositions kind commonly supposed.] There one disadvantage fulness sympathy ladies gave little affairs. The main point apt neglected branches subject. If Mrs. Minchin consulted Mrs. Buller cook, particular cook might discussed five minutes, rest two hours' visit would probably devoted recollections Aunt Theresa's cooks past present, Mrs. Minchin's "coloured cooks" Jamaica, cooks engaged mothers grandmothers ladies. Thus Aunt Theresa took counsel her friends poor Matilda, hardly kept Matilda's case long enough even master facts, particular occasion Mrs. St. John plunged series illustrative anecdotes terrible kind, she always talked, she dressed, extremes. The moral every story Matilda sent school. "And I will send last year's numbers _Milliner Mantua-maker_, dear Mrs. Buller. There always lots interesting letters people's husbands children, education, sort thing, column next pastry cooling drinks receipts. There wonderfully clever letter 'M.R.C.S.' difficulty managing young girls, recommending strict school he sent his daughter. And next month long letters five 'British Mothers' 'A Countess' able manage daughters, sent school, every way satisfied. Mr. St. John declared letters written one person advertise school, he always say sort things anything I am interested in." "You are kind," said Mrs. Buller. "There extraordinary correspondence, too, shoemaker's daughter Lambeth tried poisoning her little brother," continued Mrs. St. John. "The _Saturday Review_ article it, I believe, Mr. St. John cannot bring papers home mess, I did not see it. The letters dreadful things done girls teens. There letters twelve 'Materfamiliases,' I know, editor put numbers them, four 'Paterfamiliases,' 'An Anxious Widower,' 'A Minister,' three 'M.D.'s.' But awful letter 'A Student Human Nature,' ended every girl fifteen murderess heart. If I lay hand number---- I have lent many people, capital paper pattern too, _jupon à l'Impératrice_, ready pricked." At point Uncle Buller literally exploded room. Aunt Theresa said something draughts, I think even Mrs. St. John must aware Major banged door. I sitting footstool fire-place making night-dress doll. My work suspended horror Mrs. St. John's revelations, Major Buller's exit gave additional shock I lost favourite needle, dear little stumpy one, fine point big eye, easy thread, delightful use. When Mrs. St. John went away Major Buller came back. "I sorry I banged door, dear," said he kindly, "but whatever tempers girls may made fifteen, mine means perfect, I regret say, fifty; I _cannot_ stand woman. My dear Theresa, let implore put trash head get proper medical advice child once. And--I do not like seem unreasonable, dear, but--if must read delectable articles Mrs. St. John refers, I wish you would read her house, bring ours. I would rather coarsest novel ever written picked children, broad lines good evil clearly marked it, morbid muddle disease crime, unprincipled parents practitioners." Uncle Buller seldom interfered warmly; indeed, he seldom interfered all. I think Aunt Theresa would glad he would advised her oftener. "Indeed, Edward," said she, "I will anything think right. And I am sure I would not read anything improper myself, much less let children. And _Milliner Mantuamaker_ need afraid coming house unless I send it. Mrs. St. John always promising lend fashion-book, she never remembers it." "And you will proper advice Matilda once?" "Certainly, dear." Mrs. Buller habit asking regimental Surgeon's advice small matters, employing civilian doctor (whose fees made feel better worth having) serious illness. She estimated seriousness case danger rather delicacy. So Surgeon came see Matilda, heard her cough, promised send "little something," she ordered keep indoors draughts, take tablespoonful three times day. Matilda gone graciously ordeal facing principal Surgeon his uniform, putting her tongue his inspection; his prescriptions tend reconcile her "doctored." Fresh air thing hitherto seemed effect her aches pains, soothe her hysterical irritability, she deprived. When Aunt Theresa called elderly civilian practitioner, she sulky uncommunicative, resolutely refused acknowledge ailments, (his prescriptions failed cure her lassitude, his pompous manner professional visits rather provoking her feverish perversity) old doctor also recommended she sent school. Medical advice authoritative, yet Uncle Buller hesitated. "It is like packing troublesome son Colonies, dear," said he. "And though Dr. Brown may justified transferring his responsibilities elsewhere, I do not think parents get rid easy fashion." But Eleanor came, Major's views underwent change. If I went Matilda, Eleanor Arkwright friend, he allowed he would consent. "That girl willing go. I send child mine house her will." Major Buller asked her himself. Asked much kindness, expressed cheery hopes change air, regular occupation, society young people would make her feel "stronger happier" she seemed late, say Matilda would gone anywhere done anything her father wished give feeble idea gush gratitude his sensible sympathetic words awoke her. Unfortunately she could keep herself crying she wanted speak, Uncle Buller, horror "scenes," cut short one interview Matilda felt disposed confide her parents. But she confided me, she came bed night (_I_ did not mind her crying sentences), she very, sorry "so cross stupid," going school she meant try different. I begged her let ask Uncle Buller keep us home little longer, Matilda would hear it. "No, no," she sobbed, "not now. I like something he Mamma want, want us go school." For part I quite willing go, especially I seen Eleanor Arkwright. So sent--to Bush House. CHAPTER XIII. AT SCHOOL--THE LILAC-BUSH--BRIDGET'S POSIES--SUMMER--HEALTH. We knew summer Bush House, lilac-tree gate, one large bunch flowers summer Eleanor I Matilda school there. As left house double file take daily exercise high-road, girls would bob heads catch whiff scent passed, let cool fragrant flowers brush foreheads. On point Madame, French governess, remonstrated vain. We took turns side next lilac, sniffed away long anything smell. Even delicate colour began turn brown, fragrance vanished, loth believe blossoms fading. "I think I got cold head," said Matilda, plunged her nose cluster one day vain. "You cough, foi! Mademoiselle Buller," replied Madame, seemed labour idea Matilda rather enjoyed privilege. But I tried lilac-bush better success. "I think," I whispered Eleanor, English, "that smelt up." "Parlez-vous français, mesdemoiselles!" cried Madame, filed dusty street, corner sat another visible tokens coming season flowers; dirty, shrivelled old Irishwoman, full benedictions beggary, who, summer, sold "posies" passers-by. We school-girls good customers her. We less sentimental, less homesick, less susceptibility influence scents may, day, basis new school medicine. One girl cultivated pinks _Roses de Meaux_ her garden "at home," Bridget soon wise enough discover nosegay composed materials irresistible temptation particular customer. Another craving sight smell southernwood (or "old man," Eleanor called it), preferred combination bachelor's buttons. "There old woman 'at home' used go tea children--my brother I," she said; "there big bunches southernwood her cottage. And bachelor's buttons round garden." The brother dead, I knew, two flattened "buttons" bit withered "old man" gummed her Bible. "Picked last day together. Before he taken ill scarlet fever," she told me. She boy's portrait standing frame, and, little space bedrooms, girls piled brushes ribbon-boxes one side looking-glass best could, left rest dressing-table sacred his picture, Bible, jar Bridget's flowers, stood likeness patron saint. For part I ignorant names properties English flowers. I knew sight, Adelaide St. Quentin's bouquets, great-grandfather's sketches; I knew names others Adolphe given plants, I glad see flower. As I plenty pocket-money I liberal customer, I made old Bridget tell names flowers her bunches. I since found whenever she fault she composed name upon spot, ready wit desire please characteristic her nation. These names chiefly connected Blessed Virgin saints. "The Lord blesh ye, dear," she would say; "that is 'Mary's flower';" or, "Sure it is 'Blessed Virgin's spinning-wheel,' pretty name too!" A bitter-smelling herb she commended "Saints' Savory," I afterwards learned tansy. The youngest us, small, silent little orphan, bought posy till one day she quietly observed, "If could get peony, I would buy it." The peony procured; large, round, red, one unfeelingly suggested cut pickled cabbage. The little miss walked home her hand, looking sentimentally forget-me-not. As hard-hearted enough laugh it, never learned history made dear. Madame would certainly never allowed us break ranks, chaffer Bridget, one lucky enough think giving her bouquets. Madame liked flowers--as ornaments--and sentimental herself, fashion, sentimentality appearances. She liked bright spot colour her sombre dresses too, she economical; every day she bright bouquet day's wear tear saved her neck-ribbons. She pinned bright flowers her clean collar, clean throat, permitted us supply also Bridget's basket. A less pleasant sign summer lilac-blossom Bridget's flower-basket heat. It hot dusty, draughty streets little town. The empty bedrooms Bush House like ovens, well-filled school-room much worse. Madame would never hear complaints heat Matilda. Summer Bush House, nature things, could nothing summer India, accustomed. It useless point India rooms lived large, well shaded, ventilated constant currents fresh air. Also there, heaviest meal, longest walk, hardest work crowded hottest hours day. "England time warm India," said Madame. "I suppose hot cook," suggested little "Peony" called her, one hot day, sat languidly struggling work stifling atmosphere school-room. "I thought her to-day I looked great fat leg roast mutton. We are better she is." "And she is better she Black Hole Calcutta; does not make either her us cool," said Emma Lascelles, elder girl. "Do not preach, Peony; lessons bad enough heat." "I shall not eat dinner to-morrow, I think," said Eleanor; "I cannot keep awake weather, it is use." "I wish I back Miss Martin's summer," said another girl. We knew referred, Madame rare chance absent, pressed account, English, Miss Martin's arrangements hot weather. "Miss Martin's" school girl she came Bush House. "I cannot think earth left her," said Eleanor. "Well, nearer home one thing, masters better here, certainly. But she take care us. It was not everlasting backaches, headaches, coughs, pains side along. And weather got hot (and warm summer I there), she found got sleepy work dinner, headaches afternoon, she said she thought better scrap meal middle day, dine cool evening; used cold rice-pudding thick bread-and-butter, tea, anything was, tumblers water, one, half-past five used wash dress; six, getting done heat work, yet cool enough eat, dinner. I tell good fat roast leg mutton looked right then! It cured headaches, worked twice well, midday work getting lessons ready next day dinner. I know----" "Tais-toi, Lucy!" hissed Peony her teeth. "Madame!" "Donnez-moi cette grammaire, Marguerite, s'il vous plait," said Lucy, Madame entered. And I gave her grammar, set work again, full envy domestic arrangements Miss Martin's establishment dog days. If point Eleanor I quite agreed, among many points discuss always agree upon, need higher education women. But ill I think sex provided respect, highly I value good teaching, I would rather send growing girl Miss Martin, even fewer "educational advantages," let her start life sound, healthy constitution reasonable set nerves, her head crammed her health neglected "the first masters," good overseer "Madame" boot. For Madame certainly made us work, herself indefatigable. The reckless imprudence girls matters health proverbial, wisdom young matrons respect beyond reproach, lore long painful experience given older women apt, like lessons stern teacher, come late. It least avail benefit daughters, custom prescribes also kept dark till instructed turn lamentable results ignorance, often past repair. Whether, though many things women knowledge of, many knowledge superficial, lack learning points erudition compared crass ignorance laws health, matter one education; whether unfortunate development confusion ignorance innocence, mistaken notions delicacy, shall say? Unhappily, studied ignorance ills flesh heir apt bring double force one's ears, kind delicate-mindedness bring delicacy body train. Where guides counsels charge numbers young people (as Miss Mulberry's case), apt result delicacy (more less permanent) several bodies. But I forgetting I "preaching" Eleanor kitchen fire, writing autobiography. I forgetting, also, I yet said Miss Mulberry was. CHAPTER XIV. MISS MULBERRY--DISCIPLINE AND RECREATION--MADAME--CONVERSATION--ELEANOR'S OPINION OF THE DRAWING-MASTER--MISS ELLEN'S--ELEANOR'S APOLOGY. Miss Mulberry school-mistress, head Bush House establishment. "Madame" French mistress employed Miss Mulberry, though she pupils Miss Mulberry herself. Miss Mulberry stout, I think nature disposed indolence, especially warm weather. It creditable her she worked hard many years support paralytic mother delicate sister. The mother dead now. Miss Ellen Mulberry, though invalid, gave help teaching younger ones; Bush House long highly-reputed establishment Miss Mulberry less prosperous, could afford keep French governess hard work. Miss Mulberry conscientious, kind-hearted, pink propriety. Her appearance, bland solid, produced favourable impression upon parents guardians. Being stout, fifty sixty years old, she often described "motherly," though timidity, fidgetiness, primness her dealing girls she essentially spinster. Her good conscience her timidity helped make her feel school-keeping heavy responsibility, perhaps excuse fact suffered Bush House excess meddlesome discipline seems _de rigueur_ girls' schools. I think Miss Mulberry would felt she neglected her duty ever left devices hour. To growing girls, robust, leading sedentary lives, working hard heads, (wholesome sufficient meals, but) much animal food us accustomed home, _nag_ never free supervision irritating depressing. Much worse boys school. No playing-fields we; leave could obtained country rambles ourselves. Our dismal exercise promenade double file eye ear Madame herself. True, allowed fifteen minutes' "recreation" together, ourselves, school-room, dinner; inestimable privilege always marred fact Madame invariably came us quarter hour expired. No part school discipline annoyed us did. It element injustice children always rebel. Why she remains day puzzle me. She worked hard her living--a fact occur us days modify view her natural tormentor. In breaking faith us daily curtailing allotted fifteen minutes recreation, she deprived herself rest exact amount she defrauded us. She cannot pined begin teach soon she swallowed her food! I may her injustice, reason I think likely one that, taking us unawares, she (I will not say hoped, but) expected find us "in mischief." It weak point arrangements Bush House Miss Mulberry left us much care Madame. Madame twice energetic Miss Mulberry. Madame never spared herself she never spared us. Madame indefatigable, her way conscientious Miss Mulberry herself. But Madame just, she truthful. She had--either sense all, or--a quite different sense honour uprightness. Perhaps latter, she seemed break promises, tell lies, open letters, pry drawers boxes, listen keyholes highest sense duty. And, even worse us, she belief whatever trustworthiness her pupils. Miss Mulberry felt her duty towards parents guardians keep us constant supervision; Madame watched worried us, I convinced, persuasion certain get mischief chance, equally certain deceitfully. She gave us full credit (I never could trace she saw discredit deceit) slyness evading her authority, flattered herself her superior slyness would maintain spite us. It vexed us all, times irritated Eleanor almost frenzy. She would disgrace oftener seriously subject, Madame little afraid her, was, I think, little fond her. Madame clever woman, good teacher. She sharp-witted, ready tongue, indefatigably industrious herself; slow, stupid, lazy girls found mercy her hands. Eleanor's unusual abilities, extent her knowledge reading general subjects, rapidity she picked conversational French wielded discussions Madame, finally her industry perseverance, Madame's admiration good-will. I think she almost believed Mademoiselle Arkwright's word relied upon. Eleanor never toadied her, I fear others (we utterly her mercy!) sometimes; assuming interest feel her dissertations greatness France character her especial idol, first Napoleon. If Madame respected Eleanor, school-girls almost revered her. "She talks splendidly," Lucy said one day. Not rest us means dumb. The fact English forbidden silence us, Sunday (to Madame's undisguised chagrin) Miss Mulberry allowed us speak English, chattered like sparrows anthem. But Eleanor introduced kind talk new us. We could chatter people places, said occasion happened another. We one good mimic (Emma), two three us smart description. We observant details appearances, could one "natter" small grievances without wearying subject, without ever speculating causes, devising remedies them. But, Eleanor, facts served points talk from, talk themselves. Through her influence Why How things began steal conversation. We discussion less gossip, found better fun. "One never tells anything without beginning argue it," said one girls her one day. "I am sorry," said poor Eleanor. "You are clever, mean," said Emma. "What lawyer you would made, Eleanor! While growl Toad's tyranny, make case it." (I regret confess that, owing peculiarity complexion, Madame familiarly known us, behind her back, Toad.) "Well, I do not know," said Eleanor, puckering her brows nursing her knees, sat lounged school-room floor, after-dinner recreation minutes, various awkward restful attitudes; "I growl well anybody, I never feel satisfied bewailing black's black. One wants find it is black, anything would make white. Besides, I think perhaps one looks one's grievances, one sees excuses people--there two sides every question." "There will one, two, three," said Emma, looking slowly round counting party comical imitation Eleanor's thoughtful air--"there will fifteen sides every question time we have learnt talk like you, dear." Eleanor burst laughing, us joined her good purpose, Madame overheard us, thought prudent break sitting, though short twelve minutes' rest. Eleanor set fashion reasonable style chat brief holiday hours, she apt make lessons subject discussions first resented girls. "I cannot think," she began one day (it favourite way her opening discussion)--"I cannot think makes Mr. Henley always make us put shadows cobalt. Some shadows light blue certainly, I think, especially white roads, I do not think always; Yorkshire, rate. However, far goes, he paints his things colours, whatever they are meant for; Bay Naples coast Northumberland. By bye, I know I have heard shadows snow Canada really blue--bright blue." "You are blue, deep blue," said Emma. "How talk shop lesson hours, Eleanor, I cannot conceive. You began grammar day, way enlivening ten minutes' rest." "I am sorry," said Eleanor: "I am fond drawing, know." "Oh, let her talk, Emma!" cried Peony. "I like hear her. Why shadows snow blue, Eleanor?" "I cannot think," said Eleanor, "unless something reflection sky." Eleanor always discreet enough keep her opinion Mr. Henley's style herself us. She clever girl, and, like young people, her cleverness apt aggressive; scorned compromises, always sufficiently respectful towards powers be. Her taste drawing known, Madame taunted her one day reputation talent line, her water-colour copies effective Lucy's; simply, I believe, wish stimulate her excel. I sure Madame much preferred Eleanor Lucy, matter liking. "Behold, Mademoiselle!" said she, holding one Lucy's latest copies, glorified wide aureole white cardboard "mounting"; "what think this?" "It like Mr. Henley's," said Eleanor warmly. "Lucy taken great pains, I am sure. It is quite good copy, I think." "But think it?" said Madame impatiently; she quick-witted easily "put off." "Is beautiful?" "It smart, gay," said Eleanor, began lose her temper. "All Mr. Henley's sketches gay. The thatch house reminds 'ends' Berlin wool kept, big piece work, kettle-holders. The yellow tree blue tree pretty: always yellow tree blue tree Mr. Henley's sketches. I do not know kind trees are. I never do. The trunks pink, does not help one, markings always same." Eleanor's French quite good enough give speech full weight, Madame's kindling eyes testified. She flung drawing her, bursting forth reply, when, good luck, Miss Mulberry called her impatiently she obliged leave room. I repeating lesson Miss Ellen Mulberry, lay couch near window, paused involuntarily listen Eleanor Madame. Miss Ellen good. She also gentle, timid nervousness. But her couch she saw good deal daily life school, often understood matters better thick it, I think. When Madame left room, she called Eleanor her, almost trembling voice said: "My dear, think quite right speak Madame drawing?" "I sorry, Miss Ellen," said Eleanor; "but it is I think, she asked I thought." "You clever, dear," said Miss Ellen, "and one knows better ways one expressing one's opinion." "Indeed," Eleanor broke in, "I do not want rude. I am sorry I speak pertly. But oh, Miss Ellen, I wish could see trees mother draws! How I say I like things Mr. Henley's? Like green seaweeds end pink hay-fork! And we have lots old etchings home, trees them! Like--well, like nothing real trees photographs." Miss Ellen took Eleanor's hand drew her towards her. "My dear," said she, "you plenty sense; evidently used appreciate dear mother shown taught you. Use now, dear, ask reasonable expect men could draw like old masters would teach ordinary girls' schools, or, would, school-mistresses could afford pay properly without much greater charge parents pupils would willing bear. You great advantages home, learnt enough make able say smart things; fault-finding easy trade, dear, would wiser well kinder see good get poor Mr. Henley's lessons, use brush colours, instead neglecting drawing do not like his style, which, all, need not copy sketch nature yourself. I tell you, dear child, sister I talked matter before. Clever young people apt think stupid elders never perceived brilliant young wits put straight half-a-dozen words. But I used draw little myself," continued Miss Ellen modestly, "and I never liked Mr. Henley's style. But he good old man, poor, sister shrunk changing. Still, course pupils first consideration, another master much better one could got. But Mr. Markham, one within reach, painstaking patient his pupils Mr. Henley; though his style rather better, superior lead us, whole, turn poor Mr. Henley away him. As Madame," said Miss Ellen, conclusion, "she quite right, dear, contrast negligence Lucy's industry, smart speech good taste towards her, know she knows nothing drawing, could dispute point you. There she comes," added Miss Ellen rather nervously. She afraid Madame. "I will go beg her pardon, dear Miss Ellen," said Eleanor penitently, rushing room, she met Madame passage, heard her pouring forth torrent apology self-accusation style peculiar herself. If her youth cleverness she times little sharp-tongued self-opinionated, vehemence her self-reproaches she saw herself fault always joke knew her. "Eleanor's confessions matched her favourite Jeremy Taylor's," said Jack one day. "She is bumptious next time, same," said Clement. He disputing Eleanor, generous grace meeting apology half-way part his character. He arbitrary disposition, Eleanor extent shared. He controlled fairness discussions men, men only. With Eleanor, persisted thinking herself, slow express her thoughts, he many hot disputes, he often seemed unable fair, always trouble reasonable. By his account he "detested girls opinions." Abroad he politely contemptuous feminine ideas; home he apt rudely so. But one, later development many-sided Clement. And subject digression, business here. CHAPTER XV. ELEANOR'S THEORIES REDUCED TO PRACTICE--STUDIES--THE ARITHMETIC-MASTER. Madame ungenerous apology. She believed Eleanor too, quite disposed think Eleanor might right dispute anybody herself. Perhaps she hoped hear her triumph discussion Mr. Henley, perhaps punishment her presumptuous remarks Madame started subject following day drawing-master himself. "Miss Arkwright says trees one, Mr. Henley," she began. (Madame's English perfect.) "Except half yellow half blue. She knows kind even." The poor little drawing-master, moment "touching up" yellow tree one younger girls' copies, trying skilfully distributed dabs make look less like faded cabbage-leaf, blushed, laid his brush. Eleanor, beginning colour copy mountain scene, turned scarlet, let her first wash dry unmanageable shapes she darted indignant glances Madame, appeared enjoy her bit malice. "Miss Arkwright observe sketches indicating general effect scene; tree studies." "I know, Mr. Henley," said poor Eleanor, much confusion; "at least, I mean I do not know anything water-colour sketching, I ought said anything; I never thought Madame would repeat it. I thinking pencil-drawings etchings; I like know one tree another," she added honestly. "You draw pencil yourself?" asked Mr. Henley. "Oh no!" said Eleanor; "at least little. It mother's drawings I thinking of; she used show us different ways foliage different trees, marking bark trunks." Mr. Henley drew sheet paper his portfolio, took pencil his case. "Let us see, dear young lady, remember lessons. The pencil well cut. There flat sides shading, sharp ends outlines." Madame's thin lips pursed ghost smile, Eleanor, hot cheeks hands, came across "the room" put her theories practice. "I cannot it, I know," she said, she sat down, gave herself one nervous twitches common girls hobble-de-hoy age. But Eleanor's nervous' spasms always mitigated getting something her fingers. Pencil paper her favourite implements; moment's pause, good deal frowning, she said: "We have good many oaks us;" forthwith began upon bit oak foliage. "It is spray," she said. "It is good," said drawing-master, looking her shoulder. "Oak branches elbows," she murmured, warming her work, apparently talking herself. "So different willows beeches." "Ve-ry good," said Mr. Henley, Eleanor fitted branches dexterously clusters leaves; "now little bit oak bark, please." "This one tree, though," said Madame, also looking on. "Let us see others, mademoiselle." "Willows nice do," said Eleanor, intent upon her paper; "and bark prettier oak, I think, easier long points. My mother says branches trees done tips inwards; fit better, I think. Only willow branches seem ought done outwards, taper so. Beech trunks pretty, leaves difficult, I think. Scotch pines easy." And Eleanor left beech began upon pine, fitting horizontal branches foliage groups admirable effect. "That do, Miss Arkwright," said little drawing-master. "Your mother good guide you; Mother Nature complete she begun. Now look copy, please." Eleanor's countenance fell again. Her pink mountain run her blue mountain, interrupted wash dried hard unmanageable outlines. Sponging remedy. Next drawing-lesson day Mr. Henley arrived minutes earlier his will not, staggering huge basket containing large clump flags waterside herbage, he dug "bodily," he said. These he arranged tray, bottom basket produced broken fragments red earthenware jug. "It favourite mine, Miss Arkwright," said he; "but sacred maid-of-all-work? My consolation, she smashed morning, thought would serve foreground sketch." Saying which, kind-hearted little man laid red crocks among weeds, much pulling blinds coax good light subject, he called Eleanor set work. "It _very_ good you," said Eleanor emphatically. "When I rude, too!" "It pleasure," said old man; "and doubly well. I like try myself," he added, making hasty dashes pencil. "Ah, dear young lady, thankful sketch pleasure, bread! It pleasanter learn teach." Out gratitude Mr. Henley alone, Eleanor would done her best new "study"; apart change subject delightful her. She accurate eye, her outlines hitherto contrasted favourably her colouring copies sketches she could like. The old drawing-master delighted her pencil sketch his "crockery among reeds," Eleanor confessed getting help choice use her colours. "Studies" became fashion among intelligent pupils Bush House; though I heard experience justified old man's prophecy would popular parents former style been. "They like lakes, boats, mountains, ruins, brighter style colouring," he said, and, proved, truth. Eleanor his favourite pupil. Indeed, she favour teachers. A certain quaint little German arithmetic-master; good one, whose patience often sorely tried stupidity frivolity. On occasions he rained epithets us, which, his imperfect knowledge English, often comical, roused amusement shame. But Eleanor he never harsh word. She thoroughly fond arithmetic, "gave her mind it," use good old phrase. "Ah!" little man would yell us. "You light-headed! Sometimes sum, sometimes not; never _think_. There one young lady establishment thinks, Miss Arkwright alone." I remember incident connected arithmetic-master occurred came, roused Eleanor's intense indignation. It characteristic, too, Madame's ideas propriety. The weather warm, habit dressing tea. Our toilettes simplest kind. Muslin garibaldis, coolness, "second-best" skirts. Eleanor, Matilda, I shared one room. On first Wednesday evening arrival Bush House dressing usual, Emma ran in. "I am sorry I forgot tell you," said she; "you must not put muslin bodies to-night. The arithmetic-master coming tea." "I do not understand," said Eleanor, standing one leg usual, paused struggle refractory elastic sandal look puckered brow, general bewilderment. "What arithmetic dresses?" Emma's saucy mouth snub nose twitched amusement, she replied exact mimicry Madame's broken English: "Have little delicacy ask, mademoiselle? Should young ladies establishment expose shoulders transparency muslin professor?" Matilda I burst laughing Emma's excellent imitation Madame; Eleanor dropped her foot floor stamp broke sandal, burst forth indignant torrent words, stayed necessity resuming morning dresses, hastening down-stairs. There Eleanor swallowed her wrath her weak tea; I remember puzzling myself, neglect mine, probable connection arithmetic-masters transparent bodices. CHAPTER XVI. ELEANOR'S REPUTATION--THE MAD GENTLEMAN--FANCIES AND FOLLIES--MATILDA'S HEALTH--THE NEW DOCTOR. We jealous Eleanor's popularity. She popular girls well teachers. If she apt opinionated, she candid, generous, modest. She always willing help one, (the firmest seal friendship!) she utterly sincere. She worked harder us, she commended. But lagged behind her, felt Madame's severity, created despair mind little arithmetic-master, unlucky poor Matilda. Matilda I best terms, credit happy condition matters mine. It much I learned tact sympathy (though I hope qualities ripen years better knowledge!) Matilda faithfully try fulfil good resolutions Major Buller's kindness led her make. So far Matilda's ailments mental, I think school-life may benefit. Since torments taught caution household haunted boys, I less confidential diary I used be. And I confide follies it, I certainly justified recording people's. Not Matilda makes secret hero-worship she wasted man chiselled face weird eyes, used see Riflebury Esplanade. She never spoke him; neither matter his dog, Scotch deerhound eyes like his master's, long nose (uncomfortable position must been) he kept always resting his master's hand two paced down, hour hour, sea. What folly Miss Perry talked subject boots date record. _I_ never indulged fanciful feeling towards wonder, dashed little fear--but I would liked know meaning long gaze he dog sometimes turned us! We shall never know now, however, poor gentleman died lunatic asylum. I hope, shut up, found deerhound guilty also unhydrophobiac madness, imprisoned two friends together! Of course laugh Matilda's fancy insane gentleman, though she declares time she could never keep her head--that she met thirty-four successive times Esplanade, she would borne small amount torture earn privilege one turn meet thirty-fifth--and her rest broken waking dreams possible misfortunes might account his (and dog's) obvious melancholy, impossible circumstances she act good angel deliverer. At time she kept her counsel, she ever heard weird-eyed gentleman his deerhound Mrs. Minchin concluded her advice Aunt Theresa one occasion shower nods nearly shook poppies her bonnet, oracular utterance--"She is got nonsense her head, depend upon it. Send her school!" One thing often struck reading biographies great people. They must written quite different way biographies common people like ourselves. For instance, practised writer speaking early days celebrated poets, he says quite gravely--"Like Byron, Scott, illustrious men, Hogg (the Ettrick shepherd) fell love his early childhood." And course sounds better one said, "Like Smith, Brown, Jones, nine every ten children, he wait years discretion make fool himself." Not illustrious, Matilda blushes remember early folly; poet's biographer, Aunt Theresa said severe voice, general behoof school-room, "Little girls sometimes silly, got great deal nonsense heads." I think ever dawned upon her mind girls' heads jam-pots--which fill remain empty--the best way keep folly put something less foolish in. She would taken great deal trouble her daughters might flounce behind fashions, far-seeing her motherly anxieties, she junketed herself Major Buller many entertainment, bored pains, extensive acquaintance might ensure girls partners, balls life came require them. But fashion fancies shaped, whether wholesome food tender training high faculty imagination virtue which, all, largely love hate, choose right wrong, bear forbear, adapt ups downs world, spur dull souls high hopes better--anxiety matters Mrs. Buller none. As Mrs. Minchin, she would known meant put print her read. Matilda's irritability certainly repressed public school discipline, Eleanor's companionship interests varied enlarged. But spite advantages her health rapidly declined. And without seeming attract Miss Mulberry's notice. Indeed, she meddled little matter health. She kept stock "family pills," she distributed time time amongst us. They cured her headaches, she said; she seemed rather aggrieved cure Matilda's. But poor Matilda's headaches brought pain her. They seemed stupefy her, make her quite incapable work. Her complexion took deadly, pasty hue, one eye almost entirely closed, superficial observer she perhaps look--what Madame always pronounced her--sulky. Then, matter fully lesson her fingers' ends, she stumbled series childish blunders utter downfall; Madame's wrath equalled her irony. To Matilda justice, she often used almost incredible courage her efforts learn task spite herself. Now she successful defying pain; odd revenge nature, she learned circumstances afterwards wiped completely her memory old sum sponged slate. To headache backache, vain cravings fresh air, inequality spirits temper Eleanor I patiently submitted, Matilda still added cough, seemed exasperate Madame much her stupidity. Not French governess cruelly disposed. When she took Matilda's health hand gave her tumbler warm water every morning breakfast, she good faith. It remedy she used herself. Poor Matilda furious Madame's warm-water cure Miss Mulberry's pill-box. She morbid hatred "doctored," often characteristic chest complaints. She struggled harder ever work, spite her headaches; she ceased complain them, concealed her cough great extent, process known amongst us "smothering." The one remedy she pined for--fresh air--was last either Miss Mulberry Madame considered appropriate form "cold." This craving fresh air helped Matilda her struggle illness. Our daily "promenade" dull enough, open air; kept indoors, either punishment ill-said lessons, cure her cough, Matilda's great dread. Night night, Madame paid her final visit rooms, safe, Eleanor creep bed noiselessly lower upper sash window please Matilda; whilst I sat (sometimes hour more) upon bolster bed Matilda I slept together, "nursed her head." What quaint, pale, grave little maids were! As full aches pains, small anxieties, self-repression, tender sympathy, daughters Mother Eve. Eleanor I often since said believe make excellent nurses insane, looking back upon treatment poor Matilda. We knew exactly authoritative, sympathize almost abjectly. I became skilful called "nursing her head," meant much I supported knees. Softly, firmly, I stroked her brow temples hands, passed fingers her hair back her head. I rarely failed put her sleep, she never woke I laid her down, I since suspected unconscious mesmerism. One night, I long asleep, I awakened Matilda's hysterical sobs. She "could not get comfortable position;" her "back ached so." Our bed narrow, I commonly lay poised upon outer edge give Matilda room I rolled floor. We spoke undertones, Eleanor awake. "Come see sleep me, Margery," she said. "I lie straight." I scrambled out, willingly crept behind Eleanor, her still narrower bed; tearful thanks protestations, poor Matilda doubled herself restful angle, fell asleep. Happily me, I well. Eleanor suffered utter change mode life good deal; she great powers endurance. Fatigue, "muddle brain," often hindered her night learning lessons next day. But she worked nevertheless; tasks, her account she "drove her head" bed, though she quite unable say evening, seemed arrange properly her memory morning. Matilda's ill-health came crisis last. To smother cough successfully, must able escape intervals. On one occasion smothering tried long, aggravated outburst ensued, doctor called in. The Bush House family practitioner absent, new man came him, who, glances Matilda, postponed examination her lungs, begged see Miss Mulberry. Matilda learned her last lesson Bush House. From long interview doctor, Miss Mulberry emerged troubled face. Lessons went irregularly day. Our quarter hour's recreation much extended commonly cut short, Madame herself subdued. She became kind nurse Matilda, crept many times her bed night see "la pauvre petite" sleeping, wish she could satisfy. Indeed, air remorse seemed tinge kindness heads Bush House poor Matilda, connected Eleanor's mind brief dialogue she overheard Miss Mulberry doctor front door: "I feel culpable neglect," said Miss Mulberry mournfully. "But----" "No, no. At least, wilful," said doctor; "and springing best motives. But I duty, madam, towards lady responsible position, I say I known many cases ill-results life-long, rapidly fatal." CHAPTER XVII. ELEANOR'S HEALTH--HOLY LIVING--THE PRAYER OF THE SON OF SIRACH. Matilda went home, Eleanor I remained Bush House. I fancy longer repress poor Matilda's sake, Eleanor sensible her aches pains. She also became rather irritable, one squabble Madame time. Eleanor brought several religious books her--books prayers devotional works. They new Matilda me, began use them, imitate Eleanor various little devout customs. On Sunday Eleanor used read Jeremy Taylor's _Holy Living Dying_; never allowed alone, she obliged bring down-stairs. Unfortunately, result Miss Mulberry, taken away "look over," pronounced "not proper reading young ladies," confiscated. After Eleanor reserved her devotional reading bed-time, when, she got fairly her lessons next day, I will not read Bible "good books" her tone modulated reach Madame's watchful ear. Once she caught us. The books Wisdom Ecclesiasticus Apocrypha favourite reading Eleanor, seemed grandly poetical praises wisdom find encouragement difficulties struggled towards moderate degree learning. I warmly sympathized her; partly much I read beautiful read, even I quite understand it; partly Eleanor inspired also her fervour "the great war ignorance." But, I said, Madame caught us last. Eleanor lying, yet dressed, upon her bed, window open, I, sitting cross-legged floor, giving forth prayer Son Sirach, (as I flattered myself) little impressiveness. As chapter went voice indiscreetly rose: "When I yet young, ever I went astray, I desired wisdom openly prayer. "I prayed her temple, seek her even end. "Even flower till grape ripe hath heart delighted her: foot went right way, youth I sought her. "I bowed mine ear little, received her, gat much learning. * * * * * "Draw near unto me, ye unlearned, dwell house learning. * * * * * "Put neck yoke, let soul receive instruction: she hard hand find. "Behold eyes, I little labour, gotten unto much rest. "Get learning----" "Eh, mesdemoiselles! This going bed, it? Ah! Give book, then." I handed much confusion thin S.P.C.K. copy Apocrypha, bound mottled calf, I reading; ordering us go bed once, Madame took her departure. Madame could read English well, though she spoke imperfectly. The next day she speak volume, supposed her examining it. Then Eleanor became anxious get back, tried argument entreaty, time, vain. At last Madame said: "What it, mademoiselle, much wish read volume holy writings?" "Wisdom Ecclesiasticus I like best," said Eleanor. "Eh bien!" said Madame, nodding her head like porcelain Chinaman, knowing glance. "I restore volume, mademoiselle." She restore accordingly, historical narratives cut out, many nods grimaces expressive her good wishes might satisfied now. In private, Eleanor stamped indignation (whether her thick boots fostered habit I cannot say, Eleanor apt stamp occasion). We dear chapters again, however, I promised Eleanor new fine copy mutilated favourite birthday present. Eleanor good me. She helped lessons, encouraged work. For herself, she laboured harder harder. I used think she anxious get good she could school, she seem many so-called "advantages" home, her account. But I afterwards found she everywhere, strained her dark eyes books, absorbed information whenever wherever she chance. "I cannot say you are fond reading," said Emma one day, watching Eleanor she sat buried book, "for I am fond reading myself, we are alike. I call greedy!" And Eleanor laughed, quoted verse one favourite chapters: "They eat shall yet hungry, drink shall yet thirsty." CHAPTER XVIII. ELEANOR AND I ARE LATE FOR BREAKFAST--THE SCHOOL BREAKS UP--MADAME AND BRIDGET. Eleanor I overslept one morning. We tired, get hurried dressing, looking forward fines scolding boot. But crept down-stairs saw Misses Mulberry Madame conversing together second landing. We felt "caught," surprise took notice us; went next flight heard Miss Mulberry say, sigh, "Misfortunes never come alone." We soon learnt new misfortune was. Poor Lucy taken ill. The doctor see her early morning, pronounced fever--"Probably scarlet fever; he recommends school broken once, holidays would soon anyway." So one girls told us. Presently Miss Mulberry made her appearance; sat breakfast. She ate hurriedly, made little speech, she begged us, personal favour, good; decided go, best get things carefully together, help pack them. I sure responded appeal. I wonder struck Madame, time, might well trust us little more, rule? I remember Peony's saying, "Madame told help tea. I might taken two lumps sugar, I think would right." We equally scrupulous; even made point speaking French, though Madame's long absences school-room, possibility early break-up holidays, gave opportunity temptation chat English. On Monday evening tea, Miss Mulberry made another little speech. The doctor pronounced poor Lucy's illness scarlet fever, sent home next day. There lessons, spend evening packing preparations. We sorry poor Lucy, young; I think could help enjoying delights fuss, excitement responsibility packing, fact holidays begun. We going various directions, happened contrived go train London. Some dropped reached town; one lived London; Eleanor I wait half-an-hour catching train north. For I going Yorkshire. The Arkwrights asked spend holidays Eleanor. There nothing done us go together, unexpected were. How packed talked, ran other's rooms! It late got bed night. Next morning railway omnibus came us, curious sense regret saw luggage piled up, little gate Bush House close upon us. As moved off, Bridget, nosegay-woman, drew near. Madame (who she would tears she bade us adieu) opened gate again, ran out, cried shrilly driver stop, buying half Bridget's basketful one sweep, tears much excitement, flung flowers amongst us. As she went backwards step, she climbed, she fell upon Bridget, who, even excitement I think also ready tears, clung already moving omnibus, turned her basket upside laps. I dim remembrance seeing her Madame seem fall other, other's arms; then, amid shrill torrent farewells blessings French Irish, omnibus rolled on, Bush House hid eyes. CHAPTER XIX. NORTHWARDS--THE BLACK COUNTRY--THE STONE COUNTRY. We noisy, happy journey London. We chattered, laughed, hopped like lot birds turned cage. Emma sat window, made running commentary upon everybody everything passed strain seemed us irresistible wit humour. I fear conduct decorous, circumstances excused. The reaction overwhelming. Eleanor I sobered parted girls, thus became sensible fatigue faintness. We much excited eat bread-and-butter prepared early breakfast Bush House. We run stood feet three times much need was; talked laughed shaken incessantly; put heads wind sun train flew on; tried waltz seats, eaten two ounces "mixed sweets" given us housemaid, deluged heavy-scented perfume belonging one us. After this, Eleanor I felt tired journey begun. We felt faint, sick, anything hungry, probably travelled north rather pitiful plight, motherly-looking lady, sat waiting-room reading dirty book tracts--and witnessed noisy parting companions subsequent collapse--advised us go refreshment-room get breakfast. We yielded last, complaisance towards her, rewarded feeling wonderfully refreshed solid meal. We laid stock buns chocolate lozenges future consumption, and--thanks Eleanor's presence mind experience--we got luggage together, started north train carriage ourselves. We talked little now. Eleanor gazed her window, I mine, silence. As got farther north, Eleanor's eyes dilated curious glow pride satisfaction. I special attachment one part England another, I never seen much country before, treat lose comparison limited range view Bush House. As ran on, bright, pretty, sociable-looking suburbs London gave way real country--beautiful, cared-for, garden-like, grand timber, big houses, grey churches, supported obvious parsonage school; deep shady lanes, little cart trotting quaintly towards railway bridge rushed, boys smock-frocks sitting gate, shouting friendly salutations (as seemed) Eleanor myself. Then came broad, fair pastures fairy green, slow winding rivers overtook almost seen them, ghostly grey pollard willows formal mystical borders, contrasting tints pale yellow gay greens, turn shone low distances soft blue purple, sense colour great-grandfather roused made almost tremble never-to-be-forgotten pleasure. From flat fair country, grey towers Peterborough Cathedral stood ancient dignity; ran again. After country became less rich colour, grander form. No longer stretching flatly low-lying distances ethereal hue, broken wooded hills, folded one ever-increasing boldness outline. Now line ran woods young oak, male ferns bracken feet, wild hyacinths, lie like blue mist May, must weeks past made way present carpet pink campion. And distance longer azure. Over horizon lower part sky thin grey veil come--a veil smoke. We approaching manufacturing districts. Grander grander grew country, less less pure colouring. The vegetation rich almost rankness; well-wooded distances heavily grey. Then tall chimneys poured smoke landscape eclipsed sun; strangely shaped furnaces chimneys many forms, poured fire throats like dragons, might huge retorts chemical apparatus giant alchemist, ran station manufacturing town. I gazed high blackened warehouses, chimneys, furnaces, loomed stifling smoke clanging noises, horror wonder. "What dreadful place!" I exclaimed. "Look dreadful things flames coming out; oh, Eleanor! there is fire coming ground there. And look man opening great oven door! Oh, fire! And what is he poking for? And look! men black. And frightful noise everything makes!" Eleanor looking time, complacent expression. She said, "It busy place. I hear trade's good now, too." And, "You see furnaces night, Margery, lighting hills. It is grand!" As she sniffed smoke with, I might almost say, relish, I felt she sympathize disgust. But discussion subject stopped change carriages, settled comfortably more, I got bit iron "filings" eye. It gave good deal pain inconvenience, time I could look window again, left black town far behind. The hills almost mountains now, sloped away sides us bleak awful grandeur. The woodlands fewer; moors. Only hours back amongst deep hedges shady lanes, hedges stone walls, deep embowered lanes could trace unsheltered roads, gleaming wound miles distant hills. Deep us brawled river, gaunt mill stone-built hamlet banks. I never seen country like this; I horrified black town, delight noble scenery beyond proportion. I stood open window, moor breeze blowing hair wildest elf-locks, rapturously excited great hills unfolded shifting clouds sent shifting purple shadows them. Very dark stern looked shade, then, moment more, cloud past, broad smile sunshine ran face, showed cultivation creeping hillside turning heather fields. Eleanor leaned window also. Excitement, set chattering, always made her silent. But her parted lips, distended nostrils, light her eyes bore witness strange power hill country sways hill-born people. To beautiful, her home. I better understood now, too, her old complaints sheltered (she called _stuffy_) lane walked two two "went country" school. She used rave park palings hedged us either side, declare her longing tear let little air in, least herself somewhere "one could see miles one, breathe wind." As stood now, drinking breeze, I think thought struck us both, exclaimed one voice: "Poor Matilda! How she would enjoyed this!" We next stopped rather dreary-looking station, got out, Eleanor got luggage together, aided porter seemed know her, she seemed understand, though his dialect unintelligible me. "I suppose must cab," said Eleanor, last. "They do not expect us." "_Tommusisinttarn_," said porter suggestively; which, interpreted, meant, "Thomas town." "To sure, meat," said Eleanor. "The dog-cart, I suppose?" "And t'owd mare," added porter. "Well, boxes must come carrier. Come along, Margery, do not mind little bit walking. We must find Thomas. We send town meat," she added. We found Thomas yard small inn. He start homewards. By Eleanor's order, Thomas lifted dog-cart, then, astonishment, asked "Miss Eleanor" she would drive. Eleanor nodded, and, climbing driver's seat, took reins reassuring calmness. Thomas balanced meat-basket behind, "t'owd mare" started good pace hill would reduced south-country horses crawl. "Father Mother away still," said Eleanor, pause. "So Thomas says. But they will back day two." We driving sandy road seen winding hills. To left precipitous descent vale river. To right, flowers, ferns, heather climbed steep hill, broken every yards tiny torrents mountain streams. The sun setting distant Deadmanstone moors; little dropping wells tinkled roadside, dozens fat black snails evening stroll, brimming stone trough reflected rosy tints sky. It grey chilly drove village. A stone pack-horse track, served footpath, run road lasted village. The cottages stone, walls outhouses stone, vista closed old stone church, like miniature cathedral. There stone grass churchyard, loose stones pleasant steep hill, scrambled taking sharp turn Vicarage grounds. CHAPTER XX. THE VICARAGE--KEZIAH--THE DEAR BOYS--THE COOK--A YORKSHIRE TEA--BED-FELLOWS. It Midsummer. The heavy foliage brushed faces "the old mare," slack reins upon her back, drew us soberly steep drive, stood still, her accord, substantial-looking house, built--"like everything else," I thought--of stone. Huge rose-bushes--literal _bushes_, "dwarfs" "standards"--the growth many years, bent load blossoms. The old "maiden's blush," rare bedding plant gardens, velvety "damask," wee Scotch roses, prolific white, curious "York Lancaster," monster moss-rose trees, hung carriage-road. The place seemed almost overgrown vegetation, like palace Sleeping Beauty. As turned corner towards house, Eleanor put her left hand dragged great branch "maiden's blush." She forgot recoil, came face. All full-blown flowers she would petals me, I made first appearance Vicarage covered rose-leaves. It Keziah welcomed us, I always affection her consequence. She housemaid then, took kitchen afterwards. After she five years Vicarage, she announced one day she wished go. She reason give she "thought she would try change." She tried one--for month--and did not like it. Mrs. Arkwright took her back again, kitchen back premises she reigns supreme day. From her learned Mr. Mrs. Arkwright, gone away parson's fortnight, still home. We lack welcome, however. It seems strange enough speak fire comfortable July. And yet I well remember heavy dew evening breeze almost chilly sunset, sort vault-like feeling rooms, week unused, made us offer resistance Keziah began light fire. While she Eleanor exclaimed, "Let us go warm kitchen." Any idea comfort connected kitchen quite new me, I followed Eleanor, made first acquaintance old room spent many happy hours. We found door shut; much, seemed, Eleanor's astonishment. But reason soon evident. As footsteps sounded stone passage arose behind kitchen door utterly indescribable din howling, yowling, squealing, scratching, barking. "It is dear boys!" said Eleanor, she ran open door. For moment I thought her brothers (who must, obviously, maniacs!), I soon discovered "dear boys" dogs establishment, let loose upon us _en masse_. I faint remembrance Eleanor brown retriever falling other's arms cries delight; I good deal absorbed care small person, heavy onslaught dogs big little. I licked copiously chin forehead impetuous, smelt threateningly calves legs cautious pack. They subsiding little, Eleanor said, "Oh, cook, shut up? Why did not let come meet us?" "And I know door, Miss Eleanor?" replied elderly, stern-looking female, who, her time, ruled us rod iron, dogs included. "Dear knows it is I want kitchen. The way dogs behaves, Miss Eleanor, _scandilus_." "Dear boys!" murmured Eleanor; dogs, settling sleep hearth, wagged tails, threatened move. "Much good cleaning," cook continued, "when great big brown beast goes roaming every night shrubberies, comes his feet clean floor." "It makes rather pretty marks, I think," said Eleanor; "like pot-moulding, white. But never mind, you have home wipe paws." "They have missed sorely," said cook, seemed softening. "I almost think knew you, mad get out." "Dear boys!" cried Eleanor, more; dogs, asleep now, wagged tails dreams. "And there is more's missed them," cook continued. "But, bless us, Miss Eleanor, do not look much better strange parts. That young lady, too, looks she enjoyed poor health. Well, give native air, there is nothing like it; you have got back soon." Eleanor threw her arms round cook, danced her kitchen. "Oh, dear cookey!" she cried; "I glad back again. And kind us, give us tea-cakes, brown bread toast, let dogs come tea." Cook pushed her away, relenting face. "There, there, Miss Eleanor. Take jug hot water you, take young lady up-stairs; you have cleaned yourselves, I will something eat; may suit dogs,--I am sure I do not want them. You have got much sensible schooling," she added. We went her bidding, left her muttering, "And folks edicate children sends  them house for, passes me; come back looking like damp handkerchief, dear knows cheap living unwholesome ways, want native air." Cook's bark worse her bite. "She gives dear boys plenty eat," said Eleanor; she provided us evening liberal spirit. What feast had! Strong tea, abundance sugar rich cream. We laid delicious butter bread thick clumps, sallow-faced Madame would thought us peril lives. There brown bread toast, too; fried ham eggs, moor honey, Yorkshire tea-cakes. In middle table Keziah placed large punch-bowl, filled roses. And dogs hearth, tea us. After tea tried talk, sleepy words died away heavy lips. So took Keziah's advice went bed. "Keziah put chair-bed room, Margery dear," said Eleanor. "I glad," said I. "I would rather you." "Would like dog sleep you?" Eleanor politely inquired. "I shall Growler inside, big boy outside. Pincher nice little fellow; you would better Pincher." I took Pincher accordingly, Pincher took middle bed. We dropping sleep Eleanor said, "If Pincher snores, darling, hit nose." "All right," said I. "Good-night." I begun confused dream, woven late experiences, Eleanor's voice roused more. "Margery dear, Growler _should_ get bed come yours, mind kick off, he Pincher fight bed-clothes." But whether Pincher snore, Growler invade bed, I slept much soundly able tell. CHAPTER XXI. GARDENING--DRINKINGS--THE MOORS--WADING--BATRACHOSPERMA--THE CHURCH--LITTLE MARGARET. Both Eleanor I visited night dreams terrible complications authorities Bush House. It curious relief us wake clear consciences absolute control conduct day. It took several minutes fairly wake realize new position. The window opposite direction (as regarded bed) room Miss Mulberry's, light puzzled me, I lay blinking stupidly spray ivy poked window shelter sun, already blazing outside. Pincher brought senses washing face his tongue; I took kindlier he been, dear boys, doubtful calves legs evening before. As dressed, I adopted Eleanor's fashion foot, I might examine her room. As case "bowers" English country girls her class, rich treasures which, like advertised contents lost pocket-books, "of value one owner." Prints sacred subjects home-made frames, knick-knacks motley variety, daguerreotypes second-rate photographs "the boys"--_i. e._ Clement Jack--at different ages, "the dear boys" also. "All sorts things!" I exclaimed admiringly. But Eleanor threatened last fine I get dressed instead staring me, went down-stairs, breakfast dogs. "The boys home soon," said Eleanor, devoured certain plates oatmeal porridge, Keziah provided, I tasted first time. "I must get gardens tidied come. Shall mind helping me, Margery?" The idea delighted me, breakfast tied hats, rummaged small tools porch, made way children's gardens. They little distance big flower-garden, path led heavily shaded shrubbery one side, hedge which, though "quickset" foundation, mass honeysuckle everlasting peas. The scent delicious. From came open space top kitchen garden, where, wall overgrown ivy, lay children's gardens. "What wilderness!" Eleanor's first exclamation, tone dismay, she added increased vehemence, "He is taken away rhubarb-pot. What Clement say?" "What it, dear?" I asked. "It is rhubarb-pot," Eleanor repeated. "You know Clement always new fads every holidays, he cannot bear his things disturbed whilst he is school. But I help I am school too?" "Of course cannot," said I, gladly seizing upon point her story I could understand, express sympathy. "And he got one rhubarb-pots last holidays," Eleanor continued. "It rather broken, Thomas gave his then, it is mean moved now, I shall tell so. And Clement painted church windows it, stuck plant ivy top garden. He thought would force ivy, he expected would grow big time he came home. He wanted hang top, look like ruin. Oh, he vexed!" The ivy plant alive, though "ruin" removed sacrilegious hands Thomas. I suggested build ruin stones, train ivy that, idea well received Eleanor; broken wall top croft supplied materials, Stonehenge suggested easy, certainly respectable, model. Meanwhile decided "do weeding first," least agreeable business, set work; I leisurely manner, befitting heat day, Eleanor her usual energy. She toiled without pause, accomplished treble result labours. After worked long time, she sat up, pressing her hand her forehead. "My head quite aches, Margery, I am giddy. It is odd; gardening never made I went away." "You work it," said I, "you may well tired. What makes work things?" "I do not know," said Eleanor, laughing. "Cook says I foy things so. But one begins, know----" "What is _foy_?" I interrupted. "Cook says foy--what she mean?" "Oh, foy anything slave--to work hard it. At least, merely hard-working, go hotly, almost foolishly; fact, foy it, know. Clement foys things too. And he gets tired cross; I, often. What of the clock it, Margery?" I pulled souvenir watch answered, "Just eleven." "We ought 'drinkings,' we have worked hard," said Eleanor, laughing again. "Haymakers, people like that, always drinkings eleven, know, dinner one, tea four five, supper eight. Ah! goes Thomas. Thomas!" Thomas came up, Eleanor (discreetly postponing subject rhubarb-pot present) sent pleading message cook, resulted her sending us two bottles ginger-beer several slices thick bread-and-butter. The dear boys, sensibly snoozing shade, divined instinct arrival lunch-basket, kind enough share bread-and-butter us. "Drinkings" over, set work again. I surprised observe four box-edged beds, Eleanor said nothing it, I made remark. Perhaps belonged dead brother sister. As weeds cleared away, one plant another became apparent. I called Eleanor's attention I found, she seemed welcome old friends. "Oh, that is grey primrose; I am glad! And Jack's hepaticas; look like old rubbish. Do not dig deep Jack's garden, please, he is always getting plants bulbs given people village, he sticks everything in, his garden really crammed full; you are sure dig tulips, crocuses, lilies, something valuable." "Does not Clement get things given him?" said I. "Oh, he plenty plants," said Eleanor, "but he is always making great plans his garden; first step towards his improvements always clear old things, make he calls 'a clean sweep rubbish.'" By time "twelve of the clock bell" rang church-tower below, heat great gathered tools went home. In afternoon Eleanor said, "Were ever moors? Did ever wade? Do care water-weeds? Did ever eat bilberries, carberries?--but they are ripe yet. Shall go get Batrachosperma, paddle bit, give dear boys bathe?" "Delightful!" said I; "but go alone?" "What take anybody us for?" said Eleanor, opening her eyes. I could say. But dressed I said, "I am glad do not wear veils. Matilda I used wear veils take care complexion." Eschewing veils every unnecessary encumbrance, set forth, followed dogs. I taken crinoline, Eleanor said might climb walls, I borrowed pair her boots, uncomfortable high-heeled narrow-soled. They thin stony roads also, and, though prettily ornamented, pinched feet. We went upwards Vicarage along hot roads bordered stone walls. At last turned began go downwards, stood top steep hill descend, Eleanor, pride her tone, asked I thought view. It beautiful. The slopes purple hills grand. I saw "moors" now. "The best part air, though," she said. The air was, fact, wind; dry, soft, exhilarating kind. It seemed get heads, joined hands ran wildly steep hill together. "What fun!" Eleanor cried, paused gain breath bottom. "Now you have come there will four us run downhill. We shall nearly stretch across road." At last came stone bridge spanned river. It wide stream, broken grey boulders, clumps rushes overhanging ferns, one caught sight water there, tiny torrents lakes among weeds. My delight boundless. I neither forget describe first experiences real country life, Eleanor I rambled together. I think she least happy I, time time wished hearts "the girls" could too. The least wisely managed respectable schools good point, enlarges one's sympathies friendships! We wandered little way Ewden, Eleanor called river, then, coming clear, running bit stream, big grey boulder bank hard leave shoes stockings on, took off, also hats, and, kilting petticoats, plunged bravely stream. "Wet head!" shouted Eleanor; following her example, well I could laughing, needful efforts keep feet, I dabbled head liberally water scooped palms hands. "Oh!" I cried, "how strong water is, deliciously cold is! And oh, look little fishes! They are round feet. And oh, Eleanor, call dogs, they are knocking down! How hard stones are, oh, slippery!" I fell convenient boulder, Eleanor turned back, dogs raging splashing around her. "I hope you are treading Batrachosperma?" she said, anxiously. "What it?" I cried. "It is I have chiefly come for," said she. "I want lay out. It is water-weed; fresh-water alga, know, like seaweed, fresh-water plant. I am looking stone grew near. Oh, that is you are on! Climb way, Margery dear. It is rather rare kind weed, I do not want spoiled. Call dogs, please. Oh, look bits they have broken off!" Eleanor dodged darted catch certain fragments dark-looking stuff whirled away. With much difficulty she caught two three, laid one hand. But I prepared fact felt like bit jelly, slipped fingers I time examine beauty jointed branches pointed Eleanor, moment hopelessly lost. We put got dock-leaves safety, waded back stockings, put hats walked barefoot yards heather, dry feet, resumed boots stockings set homewards. "We will go lower road," said Eleanor, "and look church." For time Eleanor passed rickety gates south porch, I lingered amongst gravestones, reading quaint inscriptions. Quaint matter manner rhyme spelling. As I also drew towards porch, I looked see I could tell time dial it. I could not, (in spite brief learning Dr. Russell's grammar) could I interpret Latin motto, "_Fugit Hora. Ora_"--"The hour flies. Pray." As I came slowly softly aisle, I fancied Eleanor kneeling, strange British shame prayer made her start her feet kept kneeling also; though peculiar peace devout solemnity seemed breath ancient House God made long something expressive feelings stand stare. There handsome church Riflebury; one Bullers "attended" seaside new, beautiful. The one Miss Mulberry took us older, uglier. I never seen one old parish churches. This cathedral among moors, massive masonry, dark oak carving, fragments gorgeous glass, ghostly hatchments banners, aisles paved tombstones dead, new revelation. I silent awhile awe. I think bird beginning chirp roof made dare speak, I whispered, "How quiet here, cool!" I hardly uttered words flash lightning made start cry out. A heavy peal thunder followed quickly. "Do not frightened, Margery dear," said Eleanor; "we heavy storms here, better go home. But I glad admire dear old church. There one hot Sunday last summer, thunderstorm came Evening Prayer. I sitting choir, I could see storm south transept door, great stones transept arches. It cool here, along I kept thinking 'a refuge storm, shadow heat,' 'a great rock weary land.'" As sat together tea evening, Eleanor went back subject church. I made remark gravestones aisles, she said, "Next time go in, I want show one chancel." "Who buried there?" I asked. "My grandfather, he vicar, know, aunt, sixteen. (My father got white gloves wreath hung church her. They always used unmarried girls.) And sister; sister--little Margaret." I could say anything poor Eleanor. I stroked her head softly kissed it. "One thing made take you," she went on, "was name Margaret. I used think she might like you. I wished I sister. The boys dear, know; still boys think themselves, course, affairs. One run them, know. Not boys could better ours, but--anyway, Margery darling, I wish were not visit, going stop always, sister!" "So I!" I cried. "Oh! much, Eleanor!" CHAPTER XXII. A NEW HOME--THE ARKWRIGHTS' RETURN--THE BEASTS--GOING TO MEET THE BOYS--JACK'S HATBOX--WE COME HOME A RATTLER. It often (out fairy tale) wishes change whole current one's life granted promptly wish mine was. The next morning's post brought letter Mrs. Arkwright. They staying south England, seen Bullers, heard news. It important budget. They going abroad more, arranged two guardians I remain England education, home be--with Eleanor. Matilda go her parents; benefit, hoped, her health. Aunt Theresa sent kindest messages, promised write me. Matilda sent her love us both. "And day to-morrow come home!" Eleanor announced. When day came spent small preparations useless restlessness. We filled flower vases drawing-room, put choicest roses Mrs. Arkwright's bedroom, made hot hanging small union-jack belonged boys window, looked towards high-road. Eleanor even went far provoke severe snub cook, offering suggestions food prepared travellers. The dogs fully understood something impending, wandered room room heels, sitting pant whenever gave chance, emptying water jug Mr. Arkwright's dressing-room often obliged shut door Keziah filled ewer. About half-an-hour curfew bell rung cab came. The dogs shut time, they, we, Arkwrights met confused noisy greeting. "GOD bless you, dear!" I heard Mr. Arkwright say affectionately, he added almost breath, "Do call dogs, dear, else take mother's beasts." I suppose Eleanor chose latter alternative, she call dogs, she took away two three tin cans Mr. Arkwright laden, made look like particularly respectable milkman. "What they?" she asked. "Crassys," said Mrs. Arkwright, apparent triumph her tone, "and Serpulæ, two Chitons, several things." I thought Uncle Buller's "collection," ask new "beasts" insects, Eleanor, doubtful glance cans, said, "Have brought fresh water?" Mrs. Arkwright pointed triumphantly big stone-bottle cased wickerwork, cabman staggering towards door. It looked like spirits vinegar, was, I discovered, seawater aquarium. With I already made acquaintance, helped Eleanor wipe mouths certain spotted sea anemones camel's-hair brush every day since arrival. "The Crassys much beautiful," she assured me, helped Mrs. Arkwright find places new-comers. "We call Crassys name Crassicornis. I do not believe they will live, though, delicate." "I rather think may big get hurt taken rocks," said Mrs. Arkwright, "and careful these." "I am _afraid_ Serpulæ will not live!" said Eleanor, gazing anxiously puckered brows glass tank. Mrs. Arkwright reply, dogs burst room, and, nearly upsetting us aquarium, bounded again. "Dear boys!" cried Eleanor. And "Dear boys!" murmured Mrs. Arkwright behind magnifying glass, she examining "beasts." "I wonder they are running for?" said I. The reason proved supper ready, dogs wanted us come dining-room. Mr. Arkwright announced sedate fashion, took him, leaving Eleanor her mother follow us. "In three days more," said Eleanor, sat down, "the boys here, shall quite happy." Eleanor I much absorbed prospect boys' arrival coming her parents. We made "ruin" top little gardens, quite fulfil ideal done, hoped would look better ivy luxuriant. We made beds look tidy. The fourth bed given me. "Now _are_ sister!" Eleanor cried. "It seems make real got _her_ bed." We thoroughly put order old nursery, "the boys' room," proceeding Growler Pincher took great interest, jumping beds, smelling everything set out. Growler Clement's dog, I found, Pincher belonged Jack. "They will come cab, luggage," said Eleanor, "and never quite sure come; it is use sending meet them. They often miss trains purpose stay somewhere road fun. But I think they will come right time--I begged to--and we will go meet donkey-carriage." The donkey-carriage pretty little thing four wheels, seat front seat behind, capable holding one small person. Eleanor almost outgrown front seat, she managed squeeze it, I climbed behind. We dressed Neddy's head hats liberally roses, festive appearance drew notice villagers, one whom, cottage-doors, asked going meet "the young gentlemen," added, "They will rare glad get home, I reckon!" Impatience made us early, drove little distance espying cab, toiled uphill much pace black snails crawled roadside. Eleanor drew ditch, stood waved handkerchiefs. In moment two handkerchiefs waving cab-windows. We shouted, faint hoorays came back upon breeze. Neddy pricked his ears, dogs barked, cabman remained unmoved, though could see sticks umbrellas poked within, vain effort induce hasten on. At last met. The boys tumbled out, one side, good deal fragmentary luggage tumbled them. Clement seemed rather older Eleanor, Jack, I thought, little younger me. "How d'ye do, Margery?" said Jack, shaking warmly hand. "I am awfully glad hear news you; shall square now, two two, like quadrille." "How do, Miss Vandaleur?" said Clement. "Look here, Eleanor," Jack broke again; "I will drive Margery home donkey-carriage, go Clem cab. I wish you would give wreath hat, too." Eleanor willingly agreed, wreath adjusted Jack's hat, taking places, he caught sight luggage fallen Clement's side cab--some fishing-rods, squirrel fish-basket, hat-box. "Oh!" he screamed, "there is hat-box! Take reins, Margery!" he flew wheel, returned, hat-box hand. "Is new hat?" I asked sympathizingly. "A hat!" he scornfully exclaimed. "My hat's loose cab somewhere, came all; beetles here, pinned sides. Would mind taking knee, safe?" And placed there, he scrambled front seat, start (the cab waiting us, cabman looking grim smile Jack, whilst energetic Eleanor rearranged luggage inside), came second check. "Have got pin?" Jack asked me. "I will see," said I; "what for?" "To touch Neddy with. We are going home rattler." But earnestly remonstrating pin, Jack contented pointing stick, he assured would "hurt much more." "Now, cabby!" he cried, "keep crawler back till we are well away. You would better let us go first, might pass road, hurt feelings spirited beast yours. Do like going fast, Margery?" "As fast like," said I. I knew nothing whatever horses donkeys, poor legs could bear; I much liked passing swiftly air. I think Neddy suffered, however, though went back pace marvellously different came. We light weights, Master Neddy overfed, underworked gentleman, acutest discrimination his drivers. Jack's voice quite enough; stick superfluous. When came top steep hill leading village, Jack asked me, "Shall go rattler?" "Oh, do!" said I. "Hold hat-box, then, do not tumble out." Down went. The carriage swayed side side; I sat arms tightly clasped round hat-box, felt I flying straight church-tower. It delightful, I noticed Jack speak till reached foot hill. Then he said, "Well, that is blessing! I never thought get safe bottom." "Then drive fast?" I inquired. "My dear Margery, there is drag carriage; I would given Neddy his head he could not stop himself, could I. But he is plucky, sure-footed little beast; I shall walk hill respect him." I resolved same, clambered out, leaving hat-box seat. I went Jack, patting Neddy's neck, he stuck his right arm, said, "Link!" "What?" said I. "Link," said Jack; he stuck his elbow unmistakable fashion, I took his arm. "We call linking, parts," said Jack. "Good-evening, Mrs. Loxley. Good-evening, Peter. Thank you, thank you. I am glad get home too--I think not!" These sentences replies warm greetings Jack received cottage-doors; last remark, "You do not find many places beat t'ould one, sir, I expect!" "I am popular village," said eccentric companion, sigh, turned drive. "Though I say should not, think? Well! _Ita vita. Such life's half circle_. Do know Leadbetter? That is way he construed it." "I know talk riddles," said I. "Well, never mind; you will know Leadbetter, old books house by. Plenty  them, are not there? The governor curate once, his throat bad. _He_ said Entertaining Library Useless Knowledge. I have brought home one volume add it. Second prize chemistry. Only three fellows went it; need not allude head-quarters;" he sighed again. As passed slowly shadow heavy foliage, Jack, like Eleanor, put his left arm drag bunch roses. They advanced now, shower rose-leaves fell thickly like snowflakes us--over Jack me, Neddy carriage, hat-box driving seat. We must looked queer, I think, came overshadowed road, like dwarfs fairy tale, covered flowers, leading carriage odd occupant inside. Keziah, counting days holidays, ran first meet us, beaming pleasure; though Jack, futile attempt play leap-frog her her will, damaged her cap, clung her neck till I thought she would throttled, she indignantly declared that, "Now young gentlemen home end peace everybody, choose might be." CHAPTER XXIII. I CORRESPOND WITH THE MAJOR--MY COLLECTION--OCCUPATIONS--MADAME AGAIN--FÊTE DE VILLAGE--THE BRITISH HOORAY. I wrote old friends relatives, full account new home. Rather comically-expressed account too, I fancy, bits Uncle Buller used quote years. I got charming letters him, piquant his dry humour, full affection. Matilda generally added note also; Aunt Theresa always sent love kisses abundance, atone busy write post. The fonder I grew Arkwrights, better I seemed love understand Uncle Buller. Apart were, dozen interests common--threads intellectual ties changes chances mortal life little power. My sympathy real, well ready, Major discovered new insect, almost invisible naked eye, thenceforward bore terrible specific name _Bulleriana_, suggesting creature certainly less rhinoceros, surrounding Major's name something halo immortality. He equally glad hear Jack's beetles fresh-water shells. I taken latter "the things yet collected somebody house;" I became infatuated pursuit I used get four of the clock morning search damp places water-herbage river, emphatically "the early bird catches" snails. After his great discovery, Major constantly asked I found specimen _Helix Vandaleuriana_ yet. It joke us--that new she will I discover! I old letter open now, which, writing Arkwrights, he says, "Your dear father's daughter could better home." And, I read, father's last hours come back me, I hear poor faint voice whispering, "You have got papers, Buller? Arkwright kind it, I am sure." And, "It is dark now." And tears I wonder he--with light now--knows well his true friends dealt me, happy I am. To busy certainly half-way happy. And yet every kind labour. Some occupations, however, seem peace-bringing; I mean, independent great good occupied all. Gardening, sketching, natural history pursuits, instance. Is partly one follows open air, great measure?--fresh air, mysteriously mighty power good! Anodyne, well tonic; dispeller fever remedies powerless; best accredited recipe long life. Only partly, I think. One secret happiness occupations is, perhaps, lift one away petty cares petty spites, without trying brain strength unduly, kinds mental labour must do. And delightful fellowship interests! What rivalries without bitterness; gossip without scandal; gifts exchanges; common interests mutual sympathy! In happy business holidays went by. Then question arose, Were go back school? Very earnestly hoped not; I think Arkwrights soon resolved send Eleanor away again. As me, case different. Mr. Arkwright felt he must best education: he wrote consult Major Buller. Fortunately Eleanor me, Major much prejudiced girls' schools he governesses; masters nearest town, home education decided upon. It met approval relatives consulted--my great-grandmother especially--and certainly met mine. Eleanor I anxious show idleness object avoiding Bush House. The one diaries escaped burning has, fly-leaf, one many "lesson plans" made ourselves. We used get six of the clock, work breakfast. Certain morning headaches, time I became subject, led serious difference opinion Mrs. Arkwright; she forbidding get up, I holding much aggrieved, imputing headaches anything rather Keziah briefly termed "book-larning upon empty stomach." The matter compromised, thanks Keziah, good creature's offering bring new milk bread-and-butter every morning I began work. She really brought I dressed, headaches vanished. Though wish go back Bush House, quite unmindful friends there. Eleanor wrote thank Madame flowers, received long enthusiastic letter reply--in French, course, pointing one two blunders Eleanor's letter, French also. She begged Eleanor continue correspond her, improvement her "composition." Poor Madame! She indeed indefatigable teacher, real ambition success her pupils, which, drudgery her life, almost grand. Strange say, she came Vicarage. It summer succeeding I came live Arkwrights. She habit spending holidays family country, where, I believe, she gave instruction French music return her expenses. That summer she health, thinking herself unable fulfil her part bargain, she would go. After severe struggles her sensitive scruples, she persuaded come us instead, distinct condition she nothing way "lessons," talk French us. To persuade her accept payment her services subject another long struggle. The thriftiest women her personal expenditure, needing money sorely, Madame grasping. Indeed, her scruples subject troublesome. She ever pursuing us, book hand, sun-veil umbrella shield her complexion, garden hayfield, imploring us come wind sun, "a little dictation--of composition," even permit her hear us play duet 'Semiramide,' time seemed her last occasion far perfect. Her despair Mrs. Arkwright supported refusals comical, she pacified last "scrap-bag" odds ends net, muslin, lace, embroidery handed her, she made us set set dainty collars sleeves various "modes," sitting well shade trees, camp-stool, camphor-bag keep away insects, bodily fear dogs. Poor Madame! I thought she would fit first night her arrival, customary civility paid offering her dog sleep her bed. She never got really accustomed them, never seemed quite understand her. To end her stay snuffed her black skirts suspiciously, she still less enigma them. Madame markedly civil them, even addressed time time "bons enfants," imitation phrase "dear boys"; frequently, watching terms lived family, she would throw her little brown hands exclaim, "_Ménage extraordinaire!_" I sure she thought us strange household ways one, I think she grew fond us. For Eleanor she always liking; Eleanor's mother she became rhapsodical. "How good!" she cried me, "and truthful--how altogether truthful! What talents also, faith! Miss Arkwright great advantages. A mother extraordinary!" Mrs. Arkwright many discussions Madame political subjects, also education girls. On latter views essentially different, discussion apt wax hot. Madame came last allow English girls Madame Arkwright's views might just, _pour les filles françaises_--she held her opinions. With boys she got well. At first laughed her; Clement became polite, even learned speak French her fashion. Jack ignorant French, his English mixed school-boy idioms, Madame he seldom got conversation without wonderful complications, which, however, Jack's expressive countenance ready wit generally delivered long run. I know whether, whole, Madame like Mr. Arkwright best all. _Le bon pasteur_, she styled him. "The Furrin Lady," she called village, fond looking cottages, studying ways country generally. I never shall forget occurrence yearly village fair feast her visit: her anxiety present--her remarkable costume occasion--and strong conviction borne upon Eleanor Fat Lady centre booth quite secondary attraction Furrin Lady us, raw lads stolid farmers come hills, wise sheep-dogs heels. If stared her, however, Madame unobservant them, critical power her side. "These men dogs seem alike," said she. "Both them--they stare much say little. But looks dogs altogether _spirituels_," she added. I like record she said subject village feast. It complimentary, extent bitter general observations national amusements her disappointment betrayed her justified facts. But fault that, translating village feast _fête de village_, she allowed her imagination mislead her false hopes. She expected maypole, dance peasants, gay dresses, smiling faces, songs, fruit, coffee, flowers, tasteful cheap wares small kinds picturesque booths. She adorned herself, Eleanor me, collars cuffs elaborate make exquisite "get-up" her hands. She wore pale pink dead scarlet geranium, together spray wistaria leaf, admirable taste, her dark dress. Her hat marvellous; her gloves perfect. She shillings her pocket purchase souvenirs household; her face beamed anticipation day simple, sociable, uncostly pleasure, English lamentably ignorant of. But I think English thing she prepared herself expect she called "The Briteesh hooray." Dirt, clamour, oyster-shells, ginger-beer bottles, stolid curiosity, beery satisfaction, careworn stall-keepers babies-in-arms strange trust wares honesty change; giddy-go-rounds, photograph booths, marionettes, fat woman, double-headed monstrosity, teeming beer-houses---- Poor Madame! The contrast terrible. She would enter booth. She turned homewards rage vexation, shut herself her bedroom (I suspect tears annoyance disappointment), whilst Eleanor I went back feast, photographed dear boys Clement. Clement getting towards age clever youngsters unapt exercise talents depreciating home surroundings. He said wonder Madame disgusted, scolded us taking her feast. Jack took quite different view matter. "The feast's good fun way," said he; "and Madame wants _tackling_. I will tackle her." "Nonsense!" said Clement. "I bet shilling I take her every mortal thing afternoon," said Jack. "You have cheek enough," retorted his elder brother. But luncheon, Madame her room, Jack came nosegay he gathered, beg arrange properly, put paper frill round it. With grass fern-leaves, I made tasteful bouquet, added frill, Jack's entire satisfaction. He took up-stairs, heard knock Madame's door. After pause ("I am sure she is crying again!" said Eleanor) Madame came out, warm discussion began them, heard fragments. Madame's voice, shrillest, audible, rose distinctness she exclaimed, "Anything sŏh dirrty, sŏh meean, sŏh folgaire, I nevaire saw." Again discussion proceeded, caught Jack's arguments "customs country," "for fun it," etc. "Fun?" said Madame. "For joke," said Jack. "_Ah, c'est vrai_, choke," she said. "And _avec moi_," Jack continued. "There is French you, Madame! Come along!" Madame laughed. "She will go," said Eleanor. "_Eh bien!_" Madame cried gaily. "For choke. _Avec vous, Monsieur Jack._ Ha! ha! _Allons!_ Come along!" "Link, Madame," said Jack, came down-stairs, Madame smarter ever, bouquet hand. "Mais _link_? What this?" said she. "Take arm," said Jack. "I will treat everything." "Mais _treat_? What that?" said Madame, whose beaming good-humour expanded Jack explained pecuniary attention shown rustic swains "young women." As Clement came hall he met Madame hanging Jack's arm, absolutely radiant. "You are going beastly place again?" said he. "For choke, Monsieur Clement. _Ah, oui!_ And Monsieur Jack." "You may well come, Clem," said Eleanor, followed, laughing. Madame time discontent. Jack held her fast. He gave her gingerbread one stall, gingerbeer another, cracked nuts her along. He vowed oyster-shells flowers, empty bottles bouquet-holders, offered buy her pair spectacles see matters clearly with. "Couleur de rose?" laughed Madame. We went body marionettes, Madame screamed climbed inclined plane enter, scrambled frail scaffolding "reserved seats." These cost twopence head, "reserved" us alone. The dolls really cleverly managed. They performed closing scenes pantomime. The policeman came pieces clown harlequin pulled him. People threw heads other, shook arms off. The transformation scene really pretty, added joke dirty old proprietor burned red light noses, amid storm chaff Jack. From marionettes went fat woman. A loathsome sight, turned sick; but, inexplicable reason, seemed highly gratify Madame. She Jack came fits laughter, he said, "Now two-headed monstrosity. It will suit you, Madame!" At door, Madame paused. "Mais, ce n'est pas pour des petites filles," she said, glancing Eleanor me. "_Feel?_" said Jack, struggling crowd, dense here. "It feels nothing. It is bottle. Come along!" "All right, Madame," said Eleanor, smiling. "We will wait outside." We next proceeded photographer's, Jack Madame photographed together Pincher. By Madame's desire she led "bazaar," she bought collar Pincher, two charming china boxes, shape dogs' heads, Eleanor her mother, fan me, walking-stick Monsieur le Pasteur, fishing-floats Clement. By time children gathered round us. The children district especially handsome, Madame much smitten rosy cheeks many-shaded flaxen hair. "Ah!" she sighed, "I must make little presents children;" she looked anxiously stalls. "Violin, one six," said saleswoman. "Nice work-box little girl, half-a-crown." "Half fiddlestick," said Jack promptly. "What got halfpenny?" "Them's halfpenny balls, whips, dolls. Them churns mugs halfpenny; so is little tin plates. Them's halfpenny monkeys sticks." "Now, Madame," said Jack, "put half-crown back, give shilling. Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four. There presents; children!" Madame showed decided disposition reward personal beauty, Jack overruled once. "The prettiest? I see letting you! Church Sunday scholars tip; I shall put Catechism test. Look here, young un, what is name? Who gave name?" "Ma godfeythers godmoothers," young urchin began. "That will do," said Jack. "Take whip, thankful. Now, little lass, gave name?" "Me godfeythers----" "All right. Take doll, drop curtsy; mind do not take curtsy, drop doll. Now, boy, tell many be?" "Ten." "Which they? I mean, take monkey, make bow. Next child, come up." Clem, Eleanor, I kept back crowd well could; children pressed sides. Clem brought shilling his pocket, handed Jack. "You have bet, old man," he said. "You are good fellow, Clem. I say, lay among halfpenny lot--will you?--and give Madame. Keep eye open Dissenters, send Church children first." The forty-eight halfpennyworths proved sufficient all, however, though orthodoxy one two seemed doubtful. Madame tired; position pleased her, she gave away toys charming grace. We leaving fair small urchins, either got hoped get presents, (I suspected) partly impelled also sense striking nature Madame's appearance, set lusty cheer. Madame paused. Her eyes brightened; her thin lips parted smile. In voice intense satisfaction, she murmured: "It Briteesh hooray!" CHAPTER XXIV. WE AND THE BOYS--WE AND THE BOYS AND OUR FADS--THE LAMP OF ZEAL--CLEMENT ON UNREALITY--JACK'S OINTMENT. Our life moors was, I suppose, monotonous. I think ever found dull; broken, rule, striking incidents. The coming going boys chief events. We packed went away. We wrote long letters them, received brief pithy replies. We spoke behalf wanted clothes pocket-money. We knew exactly bring news good marks school increased subscriptions cricket bear effective combination upon parental mind, amply rewarded half sheet, acknowledging receipt ten-shilling piece match-box (the Arkwrights strange habit sending coin realm post, done like botanical specimens), brief directions care garden collection, perhaps rude outline head-master's nose--"In great hurry, loving grateful Bro." We kept gardens tidy, preserved collections dust, damp, Keziah, knitted socks them. I learned knit, course. Every woman knits village stone. And "between lights" Eleanor I plied needles boys' behalf, counted days holidays. We fresh "fads" every holidays. Many plans ambitious enough, results would, doubt, great fully carried out. But Midsummer holidays, though long, limited length. Once made Field Naturalists' Club. We girls gave "spare dress wardrobe" museum. We subdivided shelves, proposed make perfect collection flora entomology neighbourhood. Eleanor I really continue add specimens whilst boys school; came home Christmas devoted, body soul, drama. We soon converted new fad. The wardrobe became side-scene theatre, Eleanor Clement laboured day night papers powdered paint, kettles hot size, converting canvas scenery. "Theatricals" promised lasting fancy; next holidays fine weather, made drop-curtain tent. When boys school, Eleanor I fully occupied. We took good deal pains room: half mine now. I knick-knack table well Eleanor, books pictures, photographs boys dear boys, pot plants, dog--a pug, given Jack, named "Saucebox." In Jack's absence, Pincher also looked his mistress. Like conscientious girls, rules regulations devising: private codes, generally kept cipher, personal self-discipline, laws common us employment time joint duties--lessons, parish work, forth. I think made rather many rules, re-made often. I make fewer now, easier ones, let much alone. I wonder I really keep better? But not, may GOD, I pray Him, send back restless zeal, hunger thirst righteousness, He gives early youth! It easy become thick-skinned conscience, tolerant evil, hopeless good, careful one's comfort one's property, self-satisfied leaving high aims great deeds enthusiasts, believe one growing older wiser. And yet high examples, good works, great triumphs evil, single hands effect sometimes, grateful for, done, whatever may said doing. But speak saints enthusiasts good, special gifts made middle age withheld men. Is rather souls keep alive lamp zeal high desire GOD lights us life young? Eleanor I worked lessons ourselves. We always her mother "fall back upon," said. When took study Italian order able read Dante--moved thereto attractions long volume Flaxman's illustrations 'Divina Commedia'--we "fall back" good deal Mrs. Arkwright's scholarship. And spite helps library afforded us, best dictionaries, English "cribs," six elaborate commentaries upon poem, Italians prolific. During winter study languages commonly uppermost; summer sketching favoured. I think sketching brings one larger amount pleasure almost occupation. And like "collecting," sociable pursuit one fellow-sketchers well fellow-naturalists. And this, I must confess, merit eyes, I sociable disposition! Eleanor could live alone, I think, happy; I depend largely fellow-creatures. Jack I talking rather sentimentally day "old times," I said: "How jolly was, summer used sketch much--all four us together!" And Jack, rubbing new stuff his compounding his fishing-boots, replied: "Awfully. I vote take weather's warmer." But Jack sympathetic, he agree anything one says. Indeed, I sure he feels one feels--for time, rate. Clement different. He always disputes often snubs one says; partly, I sure, love truth--a genuine desire keep everybody else talking unreal way, repeating common ideas without thinking first hand; partly, too, Keziah calls "contradictiousness" his temper. He room Jack I talking, he talking us. He reading his examination. All Arkwrights work noise company, considerable powers mental abstraction. I think even sometimes combine attention work occasional skimming topics current room well. Some outlying feeler Clement's brain caught remark Jack's reply. "My dear Margery," said he, "you heart one unaffected people I know. Pray equally genuine head, encourage Jack his slipshod habits thought conversation by----" "Slipshod!" interrupted Jack, holding his left arm full length him, hand shod fishing-boot. "Slipshod! They fit close convictions, would stiff inexorable logic I did not soften newly-invented about-to-be-patented ointment warmth cheerful fire Margery's beaming countenance." Clement reading sentence. Then he lifted his head, said pointedly: "What I going advise _you_, Margery, never get habit adopting sentiments till quite sure really mean them. It painful experience folly I know trouble gives one afterwards. If ever time comes want know real opinion subject, process getting rid ideas adopted without meaning easy one." I intellectual Arkwrights. I always see Jack's jokes, I sometimes left far behind Eleanor Clement "take flight," Jack calls it, serious subjects. I really follow Clement occasion. With hesitation I said: "I do not know I quite understand." "I am sure do not," said Jack. "I feared time hair getting thick finer ideas household penetrate brain. Allow apply little ointment parting, case definite Eleanor; lightest actions proceed principles, I may mention principle I propose apply Leather-softener scalp blacksmith's wife gave cholera medicine second girl, she began rheumatic fever--'it deal good William.' Now, unguent done 'a deal good' leather boots. Why successfully lubricate skin skull?" Only dread "a row" Jack Clem enabled keep anything like gravity. "Do not talk nonsense, Jack!" said I, severely I could. (I fear that, like rest world, I snubbed Jack rather Clement, his temper sweeter, less likely resent it.) "Clement, I am stupid, I do not quite see _you_ said applies _I_ said." "You said, 'How happy were, summer went sketching!' words effect. It is like man's writing careless happiness childhood, he either forgets, refuses advert to, toothache, measles, learning his letters, heat night-nursery, allowed sit yard whilst his knickerbockers new, going bed eight of the clock, lie his conscience. I striven accurate habits thought, I remember distinctly cried one sketches." "I got 'Household Album' mine, however," said Jack; "and I defy A.R.A. difficulty securing his position." "I am afraid appearance _Phycological Quarterly_ better deserved," said Mrs. Arkwright, without removing her eye microscope she using table opposite Clem's. But demands explanation, I must go back time Jack I spoke--when used go sketching together. CHAPTER XXV. THE "HOUSEHOLD ALBUM"--SKETCHING UNDER DIFFICULTIES--A NEW SPECIES?--JACK'S BARGAIN--THEORIES. Out motherly affection, also early attempts drawing clever, Mrs. Arkwright had, years before, begun scrapbook, "Household Album," called, she pasted her children's original drawings held good enough honour; age artist taken account. Jack's gift line great Clement Eleanor, reason drawing his appeared scrapbook. Mrs. Arkwright demanded evidence pains industry Jack will not bestow his sketches designs. He resented his exclusion, made many efforts induce his mother accept his hasty productions; till summer I alluded Jack took his place "Household Album." It long drive, exhibiting country friends, Eleanor I chose place particular sketching expedition. The views furnished first, almost only, quality demanded young tyro sketchers--they pretty. There variety, too, justify choice. From sandy road, heathery bank afforded convenience seats, could look valley winding stream, whose banks rose hillsides lost finely-coloured mountains moorland. Farther on, scramble foot walls gates led us wooded gorge fringed ferns, group trees particularly graceful form roused Eleanor's admiration. "What lovely view!" burst lips friends every quarter mile; (to me) trying order carriage companions talk scenery go, point politeness. But views _were_ beautiful--"Sketches everywhere!" cried. "There is nothing make sketch _of_ round Vicarage," added. "We have done church, Deadmanstone Hills behind it, without Deadmanstone Hills behind it, till sick subject." So, weather fine, even hot, provided luncheon sketching materials, made expedition point selected. We tired time reached it. This necessarily damp one's sketching ardour, unfavourable accuracy outline, especially purity colouring. However, hesitate. Eleanor went her study birch-trees gorge, Clement climbed bank get extended view Ewden Valley; I contented sitting roadside front view, Jack stayed me. He come us. Not he often went sketching, descriptions beauty scenery roused make another attempt "Household Album." Seldom lastingly provided, his part, apparatus kind, Jack genius purveying he required emergency. On occasion he borrowed Mrs. Arkwright's paint-box (without leave), means ill supplied pencils brushes certainly his own. He hastily stripped couple sheets block whilst I dressing, materials he seated side enabled dip water-pot, began paint. Not half-way outline, I beginning realize complexities bird's-eye view middle distance valley, foreground sloping steeply upwards feet, Jack, washing large, dyed sable sky-brush pot, amount splashing savoured triumph, said: "_That's_ done!" I paused vigorous mental effort put aside _knowledge_ relative sizes objects, _see_ top stone foreground wall covered three fields, river, half river's bank beyond. "_Done?_" I exclaimed. Jack put his brush his mouth, defiance rules, deliberately sucked dry. Then he waved his sketch eyes. "The effect's rather good," I confessed, "but oh, Jack, it is proportion! That gate really looks big whole valley hills beyond. The top gate-post ought sky." "It would look beastly ugly was," replied he complacently. "You have got good tint hills; foreground mere scrambling. Oh, Jack, finish little more! You would draw nicely patience." "How imperfectly understand character," said Jack, packing his traps. "I would sit monument smile grief one, day, monument grove, even I umbrella smile under. To sit unsheltered roasting sun, make giddy gauging proportions pencil end nose, smudging mistakes melting india-rubber, quite another matter. I am Eleanor. I have got another sheet paper, I think trees rather line." "I _thought_ block looked smaller," said I, rapidly comparing Jack's paper own, feeling size developed labours. "Has she got water-pot?" asked Jack. "She sure have," said I pointedly. "She always takes her materials her." "How fortunate not!" said Jack. "Now, Margery dear, do not look sulky. I knew would not grudge bit paper get 'Household Album' with. Come ravine. You are white blank sheet Whatman's hot-pressed water-colour paper!" The increasing heat really beginning overpower me, I refused leave sketch. Jack pinned large white pocket-handkerchief shoulders--"to keep sun spine"--and departed ravine. By midday outline in. One good judge one's work, I think, whole, success. It always refreshing complete stage anything. I began feel less hot tired, I passed wash clean water outline, laying sun dry, got colours brushes. As I so, one little gusts wind unpleasant feature fine day, which, threatening change weather, made us anxious finish sketches sitting, came sandy road. In instant damp surface block looked rough enough strike matches on. But impatience besetting sin, I endured little catastrophes before. I waited block dry I brushed sand. I also waited till little beetle, crept sky, impeded his pace first wash, walked slowly distances, quitted block gate foreground. This partly I want hurt him, partly white cumulus cloud bad part sketch kill black beetle on. I washed paper more, holding knee dry much desirable, I looked subject face view colour. A long time passed. I looked looked again; I washed washed out; I realized difficulty subject without flinching, tried hard see represent colouring me, Clement (having exhausted his water similar process) came hill behind me, surly sunburnt face, replenish his bottle wayside water-trough. It that, he said, he found crying. "It is it is difficult I am stupid," I whimpered. "I do not mind working trying make best thing. And it is wind sand, though got dreadfully paints, particularly Italian Pink; makes hopeless, Clement, I do not believe would look well I could paint perfectly. It looked lovely driving home evening, now---- Just look fields, Clem; I _know_ they are green, really truly I _see_ colour road, I do not think difference shade gate-post. What shall I do?" A tear fell eyelashes dropped river. Clement took sketch me, dried tear bit blotting-paper. Then amazement he gave rather favourable verdict. It comforted me, Clement never says anything he mean. "It is _half_ bad, Margery! Wait till see mine! How get tints hillside? You have truthful mind, that is one thing, true eye well. I admire way abstain filling touches mean nothing." "Oh, Clement!" cried I, gratified I began feel ready go again. "Do really think I make anything it?" "Nothing more," said Clement. "Do not put another touch. It is unfinished, finishing would good. We have got outlandish subject bad time day. But keep is, three months hence, cool day, you will pleased look it." "Perhaps I went little foreground," I suggested; even I spoke, I put hand head. "Go Eleanor ravine, once," said Clement imperatively. "I will bring things. What _did_ make us fools come without umbrellas?" "We came cool morning," said I, I staggered off; "besides, it is almost impossible hold one paint too." Once ravine, I dropped among long grass ferns, damp, refreshing coolness resting-place delicious. Eleanor faint, neither she crying; she much happier her sketch I mine. The jutting group birch-trees well chosen, she drawn admirably. But she came add confused background trees undergrowth, her outline begun look less satisfactory. When came colour--and midday sun darting glittering interstices trees, without supplying effects _chiaroscuro_ subject already defective point contrast--Eleanor almost despair. "Where is Jack?" said I, condoling her. "He tried birches ten minutes, he went stream look _algæ_." At moment Jack appeared. He came slowly towards us, looking something his hand. "Lend magnifying-glass, Eleanor," said he, he reached us. Eleanor unfastened her chatelaine, Jack became absorbed examining water-weed dock-leaf. "What it?" said we. "It is new species, I believe. Look, Eleanor!" he gave her leaf glass almost pathetic anxiety countenance. My opinion carried weight matter, Eleanor nearly good naturalist her mother. And she inclined agree Jack. "It is good true! But I certainly do not know it. Where find it?" "No, thank you," said Jack derisively. "I mean keep habitat present. For _a good reason_. Margery, child, put sketch mine pocket block. (The paper much size own!) It going 'Household Album.'" We went home earlier intended. Even perseverance Eleanor Clement broke ill-success. Jack well-satisfied one party, and, his usual good-nature, he tried hard infect his cheerfulness. "I think," said I, looking dolefully sketch, "that good deal fault must eyes. I suspect one cannot see colours properly one feeling sick giddy. But glare sun worst. I could not tell red green palette, wonder fields everything else looked colour. And yet provokes one feeling artist would made sketch somehow. The view really beautiful." "And really beautiful," said Eleanor, pointing birch group background. "And mess I made it! I wish I would stuck pencil. And yet, say, artist would got picture it." "I will tell what," said Jack, lying face downwards picture spread him, "I believe one knew dodges, he saw everything looked one pale, yellowish, brownish tint glare sun, would boldly taken weak wash drab-looking colours his box right everything, picked stones his foreground wall, dodged shadows on, made clever sketch it. And Eleanor's. If he got his birch-trees half good hers, seen muddle trees behind in, I believe he would washed little blue grey behind birches, 'indicated' (as old drawing-master school calls it) distant stem two--and would another clever sketch you!" "Another clever falsehood, mean," said Clement hotly, "to ruin people's taste, encourage idle painters showy trickery, make believe improve upon Nature's colouring." "Nature's colouring varies," said Jack. "Distant trees often _are_ blue grey, though these, now, rankest green." Clement replied, Jack responded, Clement retorted, fierce art-discussion raged whole way home. We well used it. Indeed conversations us tendency become controversial. Over truth Keziah's saying, "The young gentlemen argle-bargles fit deave body's head; dear knows it is about." Clement finished vehement rather didactic confession his art-faith climbed steep hill Vicarage. The keynote one ought draw he sees, exactly he sees it; every subject beauty he ought perceive his perception "emasculated acquired taste prettinesses." "I shall 'Household Album' evening," said Jack, deliberate tones. "My next ambition Society Painters Water Colours. The subject first painting settled. Three grass fields (haymaking day yesterday). A wall front first field, hedge front second, wall front third. A gate middle wall. A spotted pig middle field. The sun meridian; pig asleep. Motto, 'Whatever is, beautiful.'" Eleanor I (in interests peace) hastened change subject ridiculing Jack's complacent conviction his sketch would accepted "Household Album." And yet was. The fresh-water _alga_ Jack lucky enough find new species, threw Mrs. Arkwright Eleanor state highest excitement. But entreaties failed persuade Jack disclose secret habitat. "Put sketch 'Household Album,' I will tell it," said he. Mrs. Arkwright held half-an-hour. Then she gave way. Jack's sketch gummed (it took whole page, full size block), he told us water-weed. It described figured _Phycological Quarterly_, received specific name _Arkwrightii_, Jack's double triumph complete. We glad his success, almost increased sense disappointment share expedition unlucky. "It seems waste," said I, "to got lovely place one's drawing things plenty time, come away without sketch worth keeping end, one does not know right way working." "I think there is good deal Jack said sketch," said Eleanor; "and I think one looked way real artists treated similar subjects, went tried similar principle----" "If ever go again," Clement interrupted, "but I do not suppose shall--these holidays. And way summer summer slips away awful. I am convinced it is great mistake many hobbies. No life long enough one pursuit, it is ten one die middle mastering that. One sure die early stages half-a-dozen." Clement apt develop odd theory kind, preach severity borders gloom. I never know say, even I disagree him; Eleanor takes cudgels once. "I do not think I agree you," she said, giving shove her soft elastic hair improve indefiniteness parting. "Of course it is unsatisfactory one way feel one never live finish things, another way I think it is great comfort feel one never use outlive one lasts hundred. And though one gets cross miserable failing things one works at, I do not know whether one would much happier one top tree. I am sure chief pleasure is not actually working things--I mean drudgery learning, rather triumph learnt." "There is something that," said Clement. And great deal Clement say. It take much convert _me_ Eleanor's views anything. But I think experience bears she said matter. Perhaps accounts happy remembrance old times worked things together, even failed cried them. I know practically, now, I would willingly join others going anything, though I could promise peevish stupidity sometimes, I much tired. I do not think anything untrue calling times went sketching together happy times--in spite Clement says. But he rule straight lines life, I sometimes think one may rule straight--even full truth. CHAPTER XXVI. MANNERS AND CUSTOMS--CLIQUE--THE LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE--OUT VISITING--HOUSE-PRIDE--DRESSMAKING. Eleanor I always home. We generally went visiting somewhere, least year. I think good us. Great advantages life I shared existence wasted petty round ignoble gossip social struggle, drawback almost self-sufficing, perhaps--I certain--a little laborious. I think, me, must, rate, become latter. I much less industrious, energetic, clever good every way Eleanor, one thing, idleness holds us back; I think taste gaiety (I simply mean gay, balls parties), social pleasure, pretty things, graceful "situations" runs veins French blood, helps break current labours. We led lives considerable intellectual activity, constant occupation, engrossing interest. We apt "foy" work extent grudging meal-times sleep. Indeed, one time habit obtained us leaving table turn finished respective meals. One member family another would rise, bend his her head silent "grace," depart work hand. I known table gradually deserted fashion till Mr. Arkwright left alone. I remember going back one day room, seeing so. My entrance partially aroused brown study. (He times "absent") He rose, said grace aloud benefit company--which dispersed--and withdrew his library. But abolished uncivilized custom conclave, thenceforth sat meals end. So free isolation upon Yorkshire moors trammels conventionality (one might almost say, civilization!), I think come begrudge ordinary interchange neighbourly courtesies life, occasional lectures Mrs. Arkwright, going visiting time time. It merely life running people's houses, chatting bits news threadbare one acquaintance another, Riflebury, would unendurable us. The rare arrival visitor distant country-house call Vicarage signal every one, could decency, escape unwelcome interruption. But grew older, Mrs. Arkwright would allow this. The boys, indeed, hard coerce; "bolted" still door-bell rang; domestic authority, apt magnified "the girls," overruled Eleanor good, her mother--who reasoned us far she commanded--convinced us much selfishness this, acts discourtesy. But owe her good counsels? In many evening talks she warned us follies, affectations, troubles lives might specially liable! Against despising interests own, graces chosen neglect, danger satire, love fear thought singular, and, all, petty pride clique. "I know worst," I remember her saying, "a religious clique, intellectual clique, fashionable clique, moneyed clique, family clique. And I seen all." "Come, Mother," said Eleanor, "you cannot persuade us would sympathy intellectual moneyed clique, instance?" "I warmly declared myself, one time," said Mrs. Arkwright, "but I vivid remembrance man belonging artistic clique, whose house I went friends. My friends artists also, minds enlarged, instead narrowed, one chief pursuit. Their special art gave sympathy others, high cultivation one virtue said bring rest train. But man talked shibboleth his craft one's head members his clique defiance good manners arising conceit ignorance ways society; transparent intention overheard admired reminded little self-conscious conceits children visitors. He one large family peculiarities, joined devout admiration other. Indeed, combined artistic clique family clique equal proportions. From conversation table would imagined one standard good poor humanity, one 'school' one art, absolutely one quite came brothers, sisters, parents, cousins, connections marriage host. Now, I honestly assure man really like one I ever met, called 'self-made' man commercial clique. Money _his_ standard, he seemed completely unembarrassed artist friend weight ideas his own, feeling short utter satisfaction himself. Their contempt conventionalities society equal. My artist friend passed sweeping criticism benefit (there could conversation second opinion allowed), perhaps shade less condescension--a shade friendliness--that commercial friend stopped remarks mine knowing observation, 'Look here, madam. Whenever I hear this, that, bragged party, I always say this, I do not want tell he _his_, he _'as_.'" Eleanor I laughed merrily anecdote, even quite converted Mrs. Arkwright's views. And I must justice add every visit taken us home--every fresh experience enlarged knowledge world--has confirmed truth her sage practical advice. If home still inclined feel almost duty proud intellectual tastes, quite duty proud orthodox opinions, and, worst, amiable weakness indeed think boys like boys, wholesome experience people's tastes views crammed throats modified ideas respect. A strong dose eulogistic biography brothers gushing acquaintance made names Clem Jack sacred domestic circle ever; I endured mangy, over-fed, ill-tempered Skye-terrier, idol lady acquaintance, led sometimes wonder visitors Vicarage ever oppressed dear boys. I am afraid possible--poor dear things! I positively heard people say Saucebox ugly, though he eyes like bull-frog, his tongue hangs quite six inches his mouth, and--in warm weather meals--further still! However, I keep good order, never allow troublesome people appreciate him. For I observed people (having children own) hold severe views spoiled boys girls, (having dogs own) much less clear-sighted subject spoiled terriers Pomeranians. And I want like that--dear dear boys are! Certainly, seeing sorts people sorts peculiarities often great help towards trying get rid one's objectionable ones. But like sketching, one sometimes gets despair it, though process learning art may even pleasanter feel one's self master it, one cannot say much process discovering one's follies. I like get rid _them_ lump. Eleanor said one day her mother, Mrs. Arkwright said: "We may hate ourselves, call it, come realize failings recognized before, feel probably others yet see clearly people see them, kind impatience perfection felt love us, I sure. It one's greatest comfort believe even felt GOD. Just mother would love her child better turned model perfection one stroke magic, love dearly every time tries good, I hope believe Great Father wait us good wise love us, loves us, loves help us thick struggles folly sin." But I becoming discursive ever! What I want put going visiting. There really nothing much say life home. It happy, great events it, Eleanor says us "go tangent," describe happened boys school college; first, biographies merely lives selves, nobody us two read old maids; secondly, put everything anything ten years, long biographies finished. We anxious see done, partly getting rather tired them, Jack becoming suspicious, partly got amateur bookbinding press, want bind them. Well, I said, paid visits relatives mine, old friends Arkwrights. My friends invited Eleanor, Eleanor's friends invited me. People kind; understood happier together. I fortunate enough find possessed charming cousins living cathedral town; house great pleasure us visit. The cathedral services gave us great delight; I think expression Eleanor's face, I may almost say rapture. Then certain church-bookseller's shop town, manifold attractions us. Every parochial want print paper could supply met, convenience bordered luxury. There good store, too, sacred prints, illuminated texts, oak frames, carried back sundry additions garnishing room, besides presents Jack, fond things were. Parish matters were, naturally, perennial interest us Vicarage home; ever became fad, period. But completely new art visit finally led us, I hardly know describe, unless art dressmaking general ornamentation. The neighbourhood abounded pretty clerical country homes, cousins intimate; one, seemed Eleanor me, prettier last: sunshiny homelike, irregular comfortable furniture, dainty chintz, dark aged oak, room tastefully besprinkled rest old china, new books, music, sketches, needlework, flowers. "Do know, Eleanor," said I, dressing dinner one evening toilette-table tastefully adorned use daughters house, "I wonder Yorkshire women _are_ 'house-proud' call themselves? I think villagers are, important points cleanliness solid comfort, course Vicarage _that_--Keziah keeps us like copper kettles; do not think might little house-pride tasteful pretty refinements? It perhaps rather waste time arranging vases baskets flowers every day, _very_ nice look at, I think civilizes one." "_You're_ blame," said Eleanor decisively. "You are south-country backbone, French top. It hard north-country folk, business people, neglect cultivate 'the beautiful.' We are quite wrong. But I think beautiful revenged us," added she one her quick, bright looks, "by withdrawing itself. There is nothing comparable ugliness people manufacturing town." My mind running certain ingenious tasteful methods hanging nosegays wall. "Those baskets ferns flowers in, wall, lovely, were not they?" said I. "Do think shall ever able think pretty things?" "We are fools," said Eleanor briefly. "We shall set minds it. Meantime, must make notes whatever strikes us." "There plenty jolly, old-fashioned flowers garden home," said I. It polite way expressing inward regret tropical orchids strange stove-plants. And Eleanor danced round me, improvised song beginning: "There ferns Ewden's waters, And heather hill." From better adornment Vicarage better adornment short stride. Most young ladies country homes prettily dressed. Not _à la_ Mrs. Perowne. Not milliner's handbook style dear "Promenades" places public resort; daintily, attention prettiest convenient prevailing fashions Eleanor's costumes displayed. The toilettes one young lady particular admiration; learned her pretty things made herself, overwhelming ambition seized upon us learn same. "Women ought know house matters," said Eleanor, puckering her brow gloomy extent. "Dressmaking, cookery, sort thing; know nothing them. I thinking last night, bed, I cast away desert island, make dress old sail, I should not ghost idea begin." "I should," said I. "I sew like sack, make three holes head arms, tie round waist ship's rope. I could manage Robinson Crusoe dresses; it is civilized ones much me, I am afraid." "I believe sail would go twice far could gore it," said Eleanor, laughing. "But there is waste like wastefulness ignorance; oh, Margery, it is _gores_ I am afraid of! If skirts made old-fashioned way, like flannel petticoat! So many pieces alike--run together--hem bottom--gather top--and are, everything straightforward pocket." To surprise found new fad sore subject Mrs. Arkwright. She reproached herself bitterly given Eleanor little training domestic arts. But she brought learned uncle, considered needlework waste time, she knew little gores did. She also, unfortunately, known heard excellent mother trained nine daughters perfection domestic capabilities boasted could never after-life employ workwoman domestic would know her business her employer. And good lady standing trouble poor Mrs. Arkwright's conscience. Her self-reproaches needless. General training perhaps quite good (if better than) special, even special ends. In giving us higher education, teaching us use eyes, wits, common-sense, she put meaner arts within grasp need urge, opportunity serve. "Aunt Theresa always dressmaking," I said Eleanor; "but I do not remember anything would help us. I young, know. And one young one stupid, one really resists information." I another chance, however, gleaning hints Aunt Theresa. CHAPTER XXVII. MATILDA--BALL DRESSES AND THE BALL--GORES--MISS LINING--THE 'PARISHIONER'S PENNYWORTH.' The Bullers came home again. Colonel St. Quentin retired, Major Buller got regiment, he also left army settled pleasant neighbourhood south England. As soon Aunt Theresa fairly established her new house she sent Eleanor me. There idea remaining permanently. It visit. The Major (but he colonel now) his wife little changed. The girls, course, altered greatly, I. Matilda fashionably-dressed young lady, slightly frail appearance times, Nature still revenging old mismanagement neglect. It need Aunt Theresa tell us she her father's favourite daughter. But capricious favouritism, I sure. I believe Colonel Buller one people whose hearts depths tenderness never sounded. The Bush House catastrophe long ago swept lumber-room Aunt Theresa's memory, tender self-reproach Matilda's father still seen his care indulgence her. "He will take anywhere," said Matilda, affectionate pride. "He even goes shopping me." We liked Matilda far best girls. Partly, doubt, she old friend, partly, I think, intimacy her father developed qualities she inherited him, softened others. To great satisfaction discovered gores enigma Matilda, she Aunt Theresa good-naturedly undertook initiate us mysteries dressmaking. There excellent opportunity. Eleanor eighteen, Matilda seventeen years old. Matilda "come out" county ball take place whilst Bullers, Mrs. Arkwright consented let Eleanor go also. Hence ball dresses, hence also opportunity learning make them. For made dressmaker house, she reject assistance. The Bullers' drawing-room divided folding-doors, divisions overflowed tarlatan trimmings; every fresh inroad callers (and hardly less frequent old) young ones, yards flounces finery us, swept Aunt Theresa back drawing-room, like autumn leaves breeze. The dresses successful, ball. I anxious hear Eleanor sped, I felt quite sure I could go sleep, farce go bed she beginning dance. I went, however, last, half night's sound sleep rustling, chattering, light bed-candles woke hear news. Matilda looking pale, somewhat dishevelled, great deal costume laboured reduced rags. Eleanor's dress intact, she herself looked perfectly fresh, partly she resisted, great difficulty, extreme length train fashionable, partly sort general compactness seems natural gift people. Poor Matilda nearly fainted one dances, brought away violent headache; she declared she enjoyed herself, would stayed relate her adventures, Colonel Buller would allow it, sent her bed. Eleanor slept me, gossip unopposed, except warnings. I set fire hair effort decipher well-filled ball card, put out, candle also, chatted bed. "You must danced every dance," I said, admiringly. "We sat one two down," said Eleanor; "and No. 21 supper, I danced rest." "There one man danced several times with," I said, "but I could not make his name. It looks began G." "Oh, it is his real name," said Eleanor. "It is one he says used call by. One reason I liked him, Margery dear, he said he fond you. You dear little thing, he said. I told locket chain good preservation." "Was Mr. George?" I cried, much energy Aunt Theresa (who slept next door) heard us, knocked wall bid us go sleep. "We are going to," Eleanor shouted, added lower tones, me, "Yes, Captain Abercrombie. Colonel Buller introduced me. He nice, delightfully fond dogs you, Margery." "Shall I see him?" I asked. "I like see again. He good I little." "Oh yes," said Eleanor. "It curious his neighbourhood; 202nd Dublin, know. And, Margery, he says he uncle Yorkshire. He----" "Girls! girls!" cried Aunt Theresa; went sleep. Soon returned visit Bullers, Eleanor I resolved prove benefit reaped Aunt Theresa's instructions making dresses inexpensive stuff bought purpose. How well I remember pattern! A flowering creeper, followed light stem upwards yard yard material. We picked pieces certain old bodies fitted us fairly, first work lay patterns upon new stuff, weights them, cut new bodies easily Matilda (whose directions following) prophesied should. When sleeves accomplished (and looked business-like), began upon skirts. We cut back front breadths, duly "sloped" latter. Then came gores. We folded breadths three parts; took third one end, two-thirds other, folded slope accordingly. It became quite exciting. "Who would thought easy?" said I. Eleanor almost prone upon table, cutting gores large scissors made thoroughly sempstress-like squeak. "The higher education fades view every snip," she said, laughing. "Upon word, Margery, I begin believe sort thing _is_ vocation. It great fun, absolutely brain wear tear." The gores parted she spoke, (to us justice) exactly shape tarlatan ones Aunt Theresa cut. But came put together, would not fit without turning one wrong side out. Eleanor boasted soon. We got headaches backaches stooping puzzling. We cut stuff, gores remained obstinate. By ingenuity could combine proper order, right side out, right side (of pattern) up. I really think cried weariness disappointment. "Algebra's trifle it," poor Eleanor's conclusion. I went clear brain walk, happening, I returned, meet Jack, I confided woes him. One could tell Jack anything. "You have got wrong somehow," said Jack, "linking" me. "Come Miss Lining's." Miss Lining village dressmaker. A bad one certainly, still she could gore skirt. She native village, signified her superior gentility mincing pronunciation. She also hiss sibilants peculiar herself. Before I could remonstrate, Jack knocking door. "Good-afternoon, Miss Lining. Miss Margery making dress, she is got muddle gores. Now, manage gores, Miss Lining?" Jack confidentially inquired, taking his hat off, accepting well-dusted chair. There nothing explain difficulties, I did, Miss Lining saying, "Yisss, misss," every two three words. When I said say, she sucked top her brass thimble thoughtfully moments, spoke oracle. "There is hinside hout stuff? Yisss, misss. And hup down? Yisss, misss." "And quite half gores will not fit anywhere," I desperately interposed. Miss Lining took another taste brass thimble, said: "In course, misss, patterned thing there is many gores throw hout huse. Yisss, misss." "_Are there?_" said I. "But waste!" "Ho no, misss! cuts body gores throws hout, misss----" "Well, get body them, must waist!" Jack broke in, he sat fondling Miss Lining's tom-cat. "Ho no, sir!" said Miss Lining, could not seen joke save her dignity. "They cuts good add-vantage, sir." The mystery clear me, Jack saw face. "You understand?" said he briefly, setting cat. "Quite," said I. "Our mistake beginning bodies. But get stuff." "An odd bit always comes in," said Miss Lining, speaking, I fear, experience bits saved dresses village patrons. "Yisss, misss." "Well, good-afternoon, Miss Lining," said Jack, never suffered, Eleanor I sometimes did, difficulty getting away cottage. "Thank much. Have heard sister Buxton lately?" "Last week, sir," said Miss Lining. "And she?" said Jack urbanely. He never forgot one, he never grudged sympathy--two qualities made beloved village. "Quite well, thank you, sir, you," said Miss Lining, beaming; "except she suffer deal her inside, sir." "Chamomile tea good inside, I believe," said Jack, putting his hat perfect gravity. "So I have 'eerd--yisss, sir," said Miss Lining; "and there is something pills that is spoke well magazine, sir, I think. I sent carrier box, sir, Saturday last, would done sooner, waiting Mrs. Barker pay pelerine I made her uncle's funeral scarf. Yisss, misss." Jack seldom loss, occasion he seemed puzzled. "Pills recommended magazine?" he said, strolled towards Vicarage. "It is medical tracts Eleanor taking round lately." "There is nothing pills them," said I. "They are drains, fresh air, cleanliness. Besides, she said magazine." "We do not give magazine _Parishioner's Pennyworth_ missionary one," said Jack. "I am stumped, Margery." But minutes I startled his seizing shoulders leaning paroxysm laughter. "Oh, Margery, I have got it! It _is_ _Parishioner's Pennyworth_. There is advertisement end months, like fly-leaf, Norton's chamomile pills." And I unravelled Eleanor mystery dressmaking difficulties, could hear Jack convulsing Mrs. Arkwright perfect reproduction Miss Lining's accent--"Them pills that is spoke well magazine. Yisss, m'm." We got material, finished dresses triumphantly. By next summer skilful enough use taste freedom good success. I fifteen, long dresses. I remember tasteful costumes produced; contemplated hung, flounced, furbelowed, finished, upon pegs, Eleanor said: "I wonder shall display year?" How little knew! We made dresses alike, nicety bow, thought ladylike costumes sisters so. How far guessing would worn together all! CHAPTER XXVIII. I GO BACK TO THE VINE--AFTER SUNSET--A TWILIGHT EXISTENCE--SALAD OF MONK'S-HOOD--A ROYAL SUMMONS. The marked events life generally happened birthdays. It fifteenth birthday Mr. Arkwright got letter one relations subject going live great-grandfather grandmother. They old. My great-grandfather becoming "childish," little dear duchess old frail charge alone. They daughter. The religious question laid aside. My Protestant relatives thought duty matter overwhelming, clinging heart moor home I felt so. I do not know I got parting. I wandered hopelessly familiar spots, wished I made sketches them; could I know I life me? The time short, preparations made. This kept us quiet. At last, Jack put luggage, everything me. Then he kissed me, said, "GOD bless you, Margery," "linking" Eleanor force, led her away comforted her like good, dear boy he is. Clement drove recklessly steep hill, stones, momentary expectation upset dried tears, I see much villagers' kind touching farewells. And bleak station again, familiar old porter, fate seems leave long enough _his_ post, whirling railway panorama, one passes much joy much sorrow--and I The Vine more. I wonder I like great-grandmother her youth? Some people (Elspeth among them) declare so; others I like poor mother. I suppose I Vandaleur features, eerie little incident befell threshold The Vine--an appropriate beginning life always felt like weird, shadowy dream. I ring bell outer gate arrival, Adolphe (grown up, old, ruddy boy's face top his man's shoulders) anxiously waiting me, devoted luggage, telling Master garden. Thither I ran hastily, straggling sweetbriar caught hat net, dragged off, sending hair shoulders. My hair long, however, like Eleanor's, curls, I sometimes wear loose; I stop rearrange it, hurried towards great-grandfather, coming slowly meet end terrace, his hands behind his back, old. At least, I thought meet me; he came near I saw he unconscious presence. He looked old, his face pale shrivelled, like crumpled white kid glove; his wild blue eyes, insensible them, seemed intently fixed something one else could see, he talking himself, call folk talk invisible. It silly, I really felt colour fading face fright. My great-grandfather's back west, bars red across sky, seen Scotch firs, remained sunset. That strange light everything, modern pre-Raphaelite painters fond. I tired long journey previous excitement; I suddenly remembered Mr. Vandaleur said measure lost his reason, shudder came me. In moment he saw me. I think crimson cloak caught his eye, his welcome hardly less alarming his abstraction. He started, held his hands, pained, puzzled expression troubled his face. Then flush, seemed make look older whiteness; then, shrill, feeble cry "Victoire, belle!" he tottered towards hastily I thought he must fallen; but, like vision, little figure flitted French window drawing-room, moment great-grandmother supporting him, soothing gentle words French. I could see helpless he was. For bit he seemed still puzzled confused; he clung her kissed her hand, suffered led indoors. Then I followed them, window, room candles yet lighted economy's sake--the glare red sunset bars making everything dark me--with strange sense gloom. It would hard imagine stronger contrast life new home life home upon moors. At Arkwrights' lived essentially times. Our politics, whole, liberal; theology inclined broad; ideas social subjects reformatory, progressive, experimental. Scientific subjects speciality household; and, living manufacturing district, mere neighbourhood kept us great current mercantile interests. We argued general unfixity opinions; and, full youthful dreams golden ages, willing believe young world--where yet we, words could fly--to upon threshold true civilization. Above all, life seemed short, hands full, over-full work, daylight long enough us, grudged meals sleep. How different shadow old Vine! I thankful, now, I grace, sense "wasted time," first irritating, hold supreme child-duty towards aged parents mere modern fuss "work," John Wesley called "lust finishing" labour, serve way rather own. But change great. How "pottered" days!--with needless formalities, slowness, indecision! How fatiguing enforced idleness! How lengthy evening meals, sat, trifling vine-leaves single dish fruit, till gloaming deepened gloom! At fifteen one susceptible impressions; impatient one used to. The four-post bed I slept oppressed me, cracked basin held together years circular hole old-fashioned washstand. The execution-picture made laugh now. Then, meals. No doubt great many people eat drink much, beginning discover. Whether Vicarage did, I cannot say; change unsubstantial fare old people like Vandaleurs keep flickering light life aglow great; yet slow, vegetating existence appetite soon died away. The country flat damp too; neuralgia kept awake night, regularly ghost great-grandfather done years gone by. But strange quickly unmarked time slips on. Day day, week week ran by, till lassitude crept I felt amazed former ambitions, certain facility sympathy, many respects evil, many good me, seemed mould interests fading household. And I lived life great-grandparents, science made strides, men struggles; nothing done days, wear patient goodness, loyal long-fallen dynasty, regretful ancient virtues courtesies, tender towards past beauties passions, patient succeeding sunsets, till aged world crumble close. My great-grandfather came know again, though his mind disordered, dreary condition; old age, Elspeth said, often recalled I heard state his mother's intellect her death. The dear little old lady's intellects quite bright, and, happily, entire, cultivated. I know people think babies servants woman's legitimate interests would like live women either never met with, long outlived them. I know dear granny's educated mind sense humour helped us dozen little domestic difficulties, broke neck fidgets seemed almost inevitable her great age confined sphere interests. I certainly faded twilight existence, truth strange old theory aged people withdraw vital force young companions live upon it. But every day hour stay made love reverence great-grandmother more, glad I come know her, perhaps little service her. Indeed, great-grandfather's condition kept us much among shadows. The old lady delightful youthfulness spirit, took almost wistful pleasure hearing life Arkwrights', ambitious Scotch blood her would fain kept better pace currents busy world. But grandfather joined us, change subject. Modern ideas jarred upon him. And seldom he us. The tender love old couple touching. "It must seem strange you, dear, think long lives little broken events," said great-grandmother. "But dear grandfather I never apart day since happy marriage." I think apart hour whilst I them. He followed her house, she left many minutes, crying, "Victoire! Victoire!" chiefly love, I sometimes spiteful enough think also he could amuse himself. "The master's calling again," said Elspeth, impatience, one day grandmamma teaching bit dainty cookery kitchen. "Oh, fly, petite!" she cried me; "and say his Majesty summoned Duchess." Much bewildered, I ran out, met great-grandfather terrace, crying, "Victoire! Victoire!" fretful tones. "His Majesty summoned Duchess, sir," said I, dropping slight curtsy, I generally disturbing old gentleman. To astonishment, seemed quite content him. He drew his elbows, spread palms his hands polite bow, saying, "Bien, bien;" murmuring something else French, I catch, I fancy acknowledgment prior claims royalty, he folded his hands behind his back wandered away terrace, I rushed confectionery again. I found use old fable, calmed great-grandfather past days, new idea. It was, fact, graceful fiction deceived nobody, devised great-grandmother deference her husband's prejudices. In long years poor, poverty made, tolerable graceful, Mrs. Vandaleur's untiring energy, (though he would not, perhaps could not, find occupation add income) sight his Victoire, duchess, menial work distracted him, grandmother devise method secure herself his observation she washed certain bits priceless lace redeemed her old dresses commonness, cooked delicacy Mons. le Duc's dinner, mended his honourable clothes. Thus Jeanette's old fable came use; first jest, adopted form getting rid great-grandfather he way. It must astonished practical woman like great-grandmother find completely satisfied him. But must time his helplessness impracticability tried her many ways, she fairly came realize he never could changed, her love fell his humours. On point he humoured completely, never inquired business his deceased Majesty France required attendance Duchess been! To justice, he helpless he tender husband. "He never said rude unkind word since boy girl together," said little old lady, tears her eyes. And indeed, courtesy implies self-discipline; even old man's politeness checked his petulance again. He never gave habit gathering flowers grandmother, exquisite contrasts colour I never saw combined hand. Another accomplishment his also connected his love plants. "It is little enough man house best times," said Elspeth, "and master's feckless bairn. But he makes fine sallet." I shudder almost I write words. How little thought poor grandfather's one useful gift would fatal ending! But I must put order. It end many things. Of life The Vine among them, nearly life world altogether. My great-grandfather made delicious salads. I heard say he preferred English habit mixing ingredients French one dressing one vegetable itself; he said carry far enough, neglected many useful herbs. And his salads compounded lettuce cress, forth, dandelion, sorrel, half-a-dozen field garden plants. Sometimes one flavour preponderated, sometimes another, sauce always good. Now seems I must stupid paid attention strange flavour salad day. But I thinking chiefly old lady, well (Elspeth idea she slight "stroke," cannot know now), whilst grandfather almost flightily cheerful. I tasted salad, eat it, I less inclined complain seemed perfectly satisfied. Then grandmother taken ill. At first thought development noticed. Then Mr. Vandaleur became ill also, sent Adolphe haste doctor. At last found truth. The salad full young leaves monk's-hood. Under delusion poor grandfather gathered never knew. Elspeth I busy old lady, he made salad without help one. From first doctor gave us little hope, sank rapidly. Their priest, Adolphe made second expedition, arrive time; separate rooms, Elspeth I flitted one sad attendance. The dear little old lady sank fast, died evening. Then doctor impressed us necessity keeping her death great-grandfather's knowledge. "But supposing he asks?" said I. "Say soothing thing ready wit may suggest, dear young lady. But truth, his present condition, would fatal shock." It haunted me. "Supposing he asks." And late evening he ask! I alone him, he called me. "Marguerite, dear child, thou wilt tell truth. Why wife, Victoire, thy grandmother, come me?" Pondering lie I could tell him, how, irresistible impulse seized me. I bent said: "Dear sir, King summoned Duchess." Does mind regain power body fails? My great-grandfather turned his head, and, his blue eyes met mine, I could persuade he deceived. "The his Majesty done," he said faintly firmly. The next moments seemed like years. Had I done wrong? Had done harm? Above all, he mean? Were his words part one last graceful dream dynasty white lilies, his loyal submission made Majesty France, even world? It intense relief he spoke again. "Marguerite!" I knelt bedside, he laid his hand upon head. An exquisite smile shone his face. "Good child; pauvre petite! His Majesty call also, long. Is so? And thou shalt rest." His fine face clouded wandering, troubled look, his fingers fumbled bed-clothes. I saw he lost his crucifix moving his hand head. I gave him, he clasped his hands more, carrying his lips smile, closed his eyes like good child going sleep. And Thou, O King kings, didst summon him, dark faded dawn! CHAPTER XXIX. HOME AGAIN--HOME NEWS--THE VERY END. Now past seems like dream, life The Vine, sad end, indeed justly called sad end took away together, little pain, dear souls whose married life known parting day, death (even day) divided. And I went back moors. I weak ill I started, every breath air northward journey seemed bring strength. There events porter's life, I convinced. He looked same, took boxes quite coolly, though I felt inclined shake hands delight. I cry joy toiled old sandy hill, great moors welcomed back. Then came church, Vicarage, union-jack window, villagers doors--and I home. Oh, dear boys tore pieces! There special news, seemed. Clement good taking class school, established cricket club. Jack positively found new fungus, would probably named him. "Boy's luck," said! Captain Abercrombie staying old uncle place close by, twelve miles off. And he constantly driving over. "So good-natured boys," Mr. Arkwright said. And school-children's tea birthday. My birthday come gone, I sixteen now. Dear old Eleanor I gone back old ways. She left side room untouched. It talking recent parting, come gone lives, fancy came upon us writing biographies winter. And here, dear old kitchen, round wild wind howls like music, dear boys dreaming feet, bring end. * * * * * This dusty relic old fad lying year, I found to-day, emptying box send books Oxford, Jack. Eleanor it, parted, all; her husband interest hers, keep own. She married, George Abercrombie, I mean paste bit newspaper account wedding end this, sort last chapter. It would long rest put together I write ups downs, ins outs, went marriage, I suppose things always much alike. I like much, I going stay them. The wedding pretty. Jack threw shoes extent, I went change white ones I could not find complete pair put on. He says he meant pick again, Prince, new puppy, thought thrown him, he never brought back. Dear boy! The old uncle helps George, I believe his heir, present he sticks regiment. It seems funny Eleanor living there, I here. In her letter to-day she says: "Fancy, Margery, quarrelled Mrs. Minchin known it! She called to-day solemnly forgave me, whereby I learned she 'cutting' six weeks. When she said, 'No doubt thought strange, Mrs. Abercrombie, I never called mother whilst she you,' I obliged get best way I could, I dare tell her I never noticed it. I think offence something calls, I must particular. But George I sketching every spare moment lovely weather. Oh, Margery dear, I often feel thankful mother given us plenty rational interests. I could really imagine even _our_ quarrelling getting tired other, nothing common. As is, cannot tell, till husband own, double delight everything together. As social ups downs, much money many fine dresses, 'collection' alone makes one almost indifferent. Do remember Mother's saying long ago, intellectual pleasures common consolations religion, world neither give take away?" THE END.
