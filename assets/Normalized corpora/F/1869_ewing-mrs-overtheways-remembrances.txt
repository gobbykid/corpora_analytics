 MRS. OVERTHEWAY'S REMEMBRANCES IDA. ... "Thou shall lack The flower that is like thy face, pale Primrose." _Cymbeline._ The little old lady lived way, green gate shut click, three white steps. Every morning eight of the clock church bell chimed Morning Prayer--chim! chime! chim! chime!--and every morning eight of the clock little old lady came white steps, opened gate click, went bells calling. About time also little Ida would kneel chair her nursery window opposite house watch old lady come go. The old lady one people look always same. Every morning her cheeks looked like faded rose-leaves, her white hair like snow-wreath garden laughing last tea-rose. Every morning she wore black satin bonnet, white shawl; delicate gloves smallest hands, gathered her skirt daintily smallest feet. Every morning she carried clean pocket-handkerchief, fresh rose hand her Prayer-book; Prayer-book, bound Bible, thick, she seemed difficulty doing. Every morning, whatever weather might be, she stood outside green gate, looked sky see clear, ground see dry; went bells calling. Ida knew little old lady quite well sight, she know her name. Perhaps Ida's great-uncle knew it; he grave, unsociable man, saw little his neighbours, perhaps he not; Ida stood much awe trouble idle questions. She asked Nurse, Nurse know; quiet orphan child asked more. She made name little old lady herself, however, manner Mr. John Bunyan, called her Mrs. Overtheway; morning morning, though bread-and-milk breakfast smoked upon table, she would linger window, beseeching-- "One minute more, dear Nurse! Please let wait till Mrs. Overtheway gone church." And little old lady come gone, Ida would creep her perch, begin her breakfast. Then, chimes went till half basinful eaten, little Ida would nod her head contentedly, whisper-- "Mrs. Overtheway time." Little Ida's history sad one. Her troubles began she year old, greatest earthly losses--for her mother died, leaving sailor husband infant child. The sea-captain could face danger, empty home; he went back winds waves, leaving his little daughter relations. Six long years he away, Ida many homes, yet, somehow, home, one day postman brought her large letter, her name written upon large hand. This old envelope sealed again--no make-believe epistle put post nursery door: real letter, real seal, real stamps, great many post-marks; Ida opened two sheets written Captain's hand, round fat characters, easy read, sketch Captain's ship top, and--most welcome all!--the news Captain's self coming home. "I shall papa soon, Nurse," said Ida. "He written letter me, made picture his ship; 'Bonne Esperance,' he says means Good Hope. I love letter better anything he ever sent me." Nevertheless, Ida took carved fans workboxes, beads, handkerchiefs, feathers, dainty foreign treasures sailor-father sent her time time; dusted them, kissed them, told Captain coming home. But letter she wore her pocket day, kept her pillow night. "Why do not put letter one boxes, like tidy young lady, Miss Ida?" said Nurse. "You will wear bits do." "It last till ship comes home," said Miss Ida. It need written rock, graven iron pen ever; "Bonne Esperance" (like earthly hopes) perished return more. She foundered her homeward voyage, went great waters, whilst Ida slept stormy night, Captain's letter beneath her pillow. Alas! Alas! Alas! * * * * * Two three months passed away since Ida became orphan. She become accustomed crape-hung frock; she learnt read Captain's letter memorial good hope pleased God disappoint; she fairly happy again. It midst new desolation her lonely life she come stay her great-uncle, begun watch doings little old lady lived way. When dolls seemed vanity, Noah's Ark burden, quiet amusement, demanding exertion, see little she could see old lady's life, speculate she could not; wonder fancy Mrs. Overtheway looked like without her bonnet, she herself she church. Ida's imagination carry her far. She believed her friend old, immeasurably old, indefinitely old; secret faith she never otherwise. She felt sure she wore cap indoors, nicer one Nurse's; she real tea, sugar cream, instead milk-and-water, hot toast rather bread-and-treacle tea; she helped herself meals, went bed according her pleasure convenience; was--perhaps grounds--utterly happy, always so. "I little girl," said Ida, she pressed her face sadly cold window-pane. "I little girl, sad, know, Papa drowned sea; Mrs. Overtheway old, always happy, I love her." And philosophy truth. It mistake suppose happiness others always distasteful sight sad heart. There times life seems shorn interests bereaved pleasure, relief, almost amounting consolation, believe one happy. It feeling nature, perhaps, makes young attractive old. It soothes like sound harmonious music, sight harmonious beauty. It witnesses conviction lying deep even afflicted souls (come may), things created good, man made blessed; sorrow sighing flee away. This one many things formed attraction Ida little old lady lived way. That green gate shut life child knew nothing, might one mysterious delights; believe things could consoling, imagine real entertainment. Ida would sometimes draw chair quietly table beside her own, fancy Mrs. Overtheway tea her. She would ask old lady she time church morning, beg her take her bonnet, apologise politely want hot tea toast. So far well, Ida could answer remarks Mrs. Overtheway's behalf; may believed certain point one-sided conversation flagged. One day Nurse overheard Ida's low murmurs. "What talking about, Miss Ida?" said she. "I pretending Mrs. Overtheway tea," said Ida. "Little girls should not pretend what is true," replied Nurse, whose philosophy fancy falsehood distinguished. "Play dolls, dear, do not move chairs places." With Nurse carried chair corner naughty child, Ida gave her day-dream sigh; since prolonged fancy Mrs. Overtheway present, she must imagined her borne crisis meal fashion altogether consistent old lady's dignity. Summer passed, winter came on. There days white steps looked whiter usual; snowdrift came halfway little green gate, snowflakes came softly persistency threatened bury whole town. Ida knew days Mrs. Overtheway could go out; whenever tolerably fine old lady appeared usual, came daintily steps, went bells calling. Chim! chime! chim! chime! They sounded near frosty air, Ida could almost fancied church coming round snowy streets pick congregation. Mrs. Overtheway looked much winter summer. She seemed fresh lively ever, carried her Prayer-book handkerchief hand, warmly wrapped up, wore fur-lined boots, charming. There one change, however, went Ida's heart. The little old lady longer flower take church her. At Christmas she took sprig holly, spray myrtle, Ida felt poor substitutes rose. She knew Mrs. Overtheway flowers somewhere, true, certain pots forced hyacinths passed little green gate Christmas church decorations; one's winter garden precious cropped recklessly summer rose-bushes, old lady went flowerless church enjoyed her bulbs home. But change went Ida's heart. Spring early year. At beginning February good deal snow ground, true, air became milder milder, towards end month came real spring day, snow gone. "You may go play garden, Miss Ida," said Nurse, Ida went. She kept indoors long time weather cold, pleasant get again, even amusement run shingly walks wonder soon she might begin garden, whether gardener could induced give her piece ground sufficiently extensive grow crop mustard-and-cress form capital I. It kitchen garden Ida sent. At far end cut world overgrown hedge large gaps bottom, Ida could see high road, trough watering horses, beyond wood. The hedge thin February, Ida good view consequence, sitting stump sunshine she peered gap see horses came drink. It good peep-show, indeed much better. "The snow melted," gurgled water, "here I am." It everywhere. The sunshine made rich green mosses look dry, reality wet, everything else. Slish! slosh! Put feet would, water everywhere. It filled stone trough, which, old grey steady, kept still, bade reflect blue sky gorgeous mosses; trough soon overflowed, water slipped side, ran wayside stream. "Winter gone!" spluttered ran. "Winter gone, winter-is-gone, winterisgone!" And, principle good thing cannot said often, went summer, till next winter came stopped mouth icicles. As stream chattered, birds wood sang--Tweet! tweet! chirrup! throstle! Spring! Spring! Spring!--and twittered tree tree, shook bare twigs melody; whilst single blackbird sitting still upon bough below, sang "Life!" "Life!" "Life!" loudest pipe his throat, day happiness alive. It like wonderful fairy-tale, Ida listened clasped hands. Presently another song came wood: hymn sung children's voices, one often hears carolled troop little urchins coming home school. The words fell familiarly Ida's ears: "Quite streets silver sound, The flood life doth flow; Upon whose banks every side The wood life doth grow. "Thy gardens thy gallant walks Continually green; There grow sweet pleasant flowers As nowhere else seen. "There trees evermore bear fruit, And evermore spring; There evermore Angels sit, And evermore sing." Here little chorus broke off, children came pouring wood chattering laughter. Only one lingered, playing tree, finishing song. The child's voice rose shrill clear like blackbird him. He also sang Life--Eternal life--knowing little bird meaning his song, little less devotion innocence happiness praise. But Ida ceased listen singing. Her whole attention given children scampered past hedge, dropping bits moss fungi like woodland spoil. For, tightly held grubby hands each--plucked reckless indifference bud stalk, fading fast hot prisons--were primroses. Ida started her feet, sudden idea filling her brain. The birds right, Spring come, flowers--_flowers Mrs. Overtheway_. Ida quiet, obedient little girl, general rule; indeed, her lonely life she small temptation pranks mischief kind. She often sent play back garden before, never thought straying beyond limits; to-day strong new feeling awakened sight primroses. "The hole large," said Ida, looking gap hedge; "if dead root middle pulled up, would wonderfully large." She pulled root up, and, though wonderful strong term, hole certainly larger. "It big enough put one's head through," said Ida, and, stooping down, she exemplified truth her observation. "Where head goes, body follow," say, Ida's little body soon side hedge; adage says nothing clothes, however, part Ida's dress left behind. It caught stump she scrambled through. But accidents happen, she road, something. "It like going world seek one's fortune," she thought; "thus Gerda went look little Kay, Joringel sought enchanted flower. One always comes wood." And wood she came. Dame Nature laid her new green carpets, everything looked lovely; but, said, certainly damp. The little singer tree cared this, however, blackbird him. "Will tell me, please, got primroses?" asked Ida. The child made quaint, half-military salute; smiled. "Yonder," he said laconically, and, pointing wood, he went song he could understand: "Ah, sweet home, Jerusalem, Would God I thee! Would God woes end, Thy joys I might see!" Ida went on, looking her she ran. Presently wood sloped downwards, pretty steeply, somewhat scramble; yet still she kept sharp look-out, primroses she see, except upon ground, plucked close poor heads held anybody's hands. These showed way, however, Ida picked sheer pity carried her. "This Hop-of-my-Thumb found his way home," she thought. At bottom hill ran little brook, opposite side brook bank, top bank hedge, hedge primroses. But brook between! Ida looked hesitated. It wide jump across, here, elsewhere, water usual. To turn back, however, question. Gerda would daunted her search coming stream, would one else ever read fairy tales. It true Fairy-land advantages cannot always reckoned upon commonplace children commonplace world. When straw, coal, bean came rivulet travels, straw laid across bridge others, coal degree hot unlucky occasion, might (for anything Ida knew contrary) still pursuing journey favourable circumstances. But travelling-companion expands bridge emergency met every day; poor Ida--she alone. She stood first one leg, other, she looked water, primroses, water again, last perceived one place large, flat, moss-covered stone middle stream, stood well water, which--could she reach it--she might scramble opposite bank. But reach it? nice, large, secure, comfortable-looking stone. "I must put stones," thought Ida. There plenty stream, Ida dragged up, began make ford piling together. It chilly work, cloud come sun; Ida little bit frightened fresh-water shrimps, queer, many-legged beasts, shot stones she lifted them. At last ford complete. Ida stepped daintily bridge she made, jumped triumphantly big stone. Alas! trusting appearances. The stone looked firm, insecurely balanced below, first shock one side went splash, Ida went it. What triumph shrimps! She scrambled bank, however, made charming bunch primroses, turned go home. Never mind she got back across brook. We waded streams now, good fun June, rather chilly work February; and, spite running home, Ida trembled much cold excitement she stood last Mrs. Overtheway's green gate. Click! Ida went white steps, marking sadly her wet feet, gave valiant rap. The door opened, tall, rather severe-looking housekeeper asked: "What want, dear?" A shyness, amounting terror, seized upon Ida, she could hardly find voice answer. "If please, I brought for--" For whom? Ida's pale face burnt crimson she remembered she know little old lady's name. Perhaps severe housekeeper touched sight black frock, torn was, she said kindly: "Do not frightened, dear. What want?" "These primroses," said Ida, almost choking. "They Mrs. Overtheway take church her. I sorry, please, I do not know her name, I call her Mrs. Overtheway because, know, she lives way. At least--" Ida added, looking back across road sudden confusion her ideas, "at least--I mean--you know--_we_ live way." And overwhelmed shame her stupidity, Ida stuffed flowers woman's hand, ran home lion her heels. "Well! Miss Ida," began Nurse, Ida opened nursery door (and something terrible her "well"); "if I ever--" Nurse seized Ida arm, generally premonitory her favourite method punishment--"a good shaking." But Ida clung close flung her arms round Nurse's neck. "Do not shake me, Nursey, dear," she begged, "my head aches so. I naughty, I know. I have done everything think of; I have crept hedge, right wood, made ford, tumbled brook, waded back, run way home, round town fear see me. And I have done something could never, never think tried till next Christmas, I have got flowers Mrs. Overtheway, I stupidly; she think perfect goose, perhaps angry," tears came Ida's eyes. "She will think naughty, troublesome child, are," said Nurse, seldom hesitated assume responsibility statement appeared desirable; "you are mad old lady, I think. Just look dress!" Ida looked, her tears falling much fast her clear view anything, torn edges rent seemed fringed prismatic colours. To crown she sent bed. In reality, save necessity wearing her best frock till mended, also keep her warm case she caught cold; Nurse spoke punishment, Ida wept accordingly. And triumph uncommon line nursery policy consists elaborately misleading infant mind good. Chim! chime! went bells next morning, Mrs. Overtheway came white steps green gate bunch primroses her hand. She looked usual, sky. She looked windows houses way, she expected one looking her. There face seen, however; house directly opposite, one upper blinds drawn down. Ida ill. How long she ill, matter her, Ida clear idea. She visions toiling wood again, looking vainly something could never found; suddenly surrounded cut swollen streams; crawling, unclean beasts preternatural feelers got her boots. Then heavy dreams cleared away part, stream seemed ripple like sound church bells, chimed old tune "Quite streets, silver sound," &c. And then, last, she awoke one fine morning hear sweet chim-chiming church bells, see Nurse sitting her bedside. She lay still moments make quite sure, asked voice faint surprised herself: "Has Mrs. Overtheway gone church?" On which, her great astonishment, Nurse burst tears. For first reasonable sentence poor Ida spoken several days. To ill pleasant; slow process getting back strength often less pleasant still. One afternoon Ida knelt her old place window. She up, might go out, great grief. The day provokingly fine, even now, though sun setting, seemed inclined make fresh start, bright rejuvenated glow shone upon opposite houses, threw mystic glory Mrs. Overtheway's white steps green railings. Oh! Ida wished go afternoon! How long clear shadows were! It seemed Ida whoever free go open air could nothing desire. "Out doors" looked like Paradise drooping little maid, passers-by seemed go sunny street golden dream. Ida gazed till shadows lengthened, crept street houses; till sunlight died upon railings, upon steps, last lingered half hour bright patches among chimney-stacks, went altogether, left world shade. Twilight came Ida sat fire, rose importance sunshine gone; and, moreover, spring evenings cold. Ida felt desolate, and, whole, rather ill-used. Nurse upstairs hours, though she promised real tea toast evening, signs either yet. The poor child felt weak play, reading made her eyes ache. If one tell her story. It grew dark, steps came outside door, fumbling lock made Ida nervous. "Do come in, Nursey!" she cried. The door opened, someone spoke; voice voice Nurse. It sweet, clear, gentle voice; musical, though longer young; voice one seldom hears never forgets, came darkness, saying: "It Nurse, dear; she making tea, gave leave come alone. I Mrs. Overtheway." And firelight stood little old lady, she described, except instead her Prayer-book she carried large pot hyacinth her two hands. "I brought one pets, dear," said she. "I think love flowers." The little old lady come tea. This charming. She took her bonnet, her cap fulfilled Ida's expectations, although nothing smarter soft mass tulle, tied white satin strings. But face looked it! Mrs. Overtheway's features almost perfect. The beauty her eyes rather enhanced blue shadows Time painted round them, good eyes remind one clear well, bottom he might see truth. When young she must exquisitely beautiful, Ida thought. She lovely still. In due time Nurse brought tea, Ida could hardly believe her fancies realized last; indeed realized--for bread treacle diminished dignity entertainment; Nurse would soon thought carrying Great Mogul his cushions, putting Mrs. Overtheway her chair corner. But limit even space time one enjoy tea buttered toast. The tray carried off, hyacinth put place, Ida curled herself easy chair one side fire, Mrs. Overtheway opposite. "You see I way still," laughed little old lady. "Now, tell primroses." So Ida told everything, apologized her awkward speeches housekeeper. "I do not know name yet," said she. "Call Mrs. Overtheway still, dear, please," said little old lady. "I like it." So Ida wiser score. "I sorry hear made ill account," said Mrs. Overtheway. "I many times ask you, to-night I asked leave come tea. I wish I could something amuse you, poor little invalid. I know must feel dull." Ida's cheeks flushed. "If would tell story," she said, "I like hearing Nurse's stories. At least she one, I like it. It is not exactly story either, happened her last place. But I rather tired it. There is Master Henry--I like much, he always mischief; there is Miss Adelaide, whose hair curled naturally--at least damp brush--I like her; I do not much them; Nurse generally goes quarrel she cook, I never could tell quarrelled about, Nurse said cook full malice deceitfulness, she left. I am rather tired it." "What sort story shall I tell you?" asked Mrs. Overtheway. "A true one, I think," said Ida. "Something happened yourself, please. You must remember great many things, old." And Ida said simple good-faith, believing compliment. "It quite true," said Mrs. Overtheway, "that one remembers many things end long life, often things happened long ago, sometimes slight wonderful forgotten. I remember, instance, I age, incident occurred gave intense dislike special shade brown satin. I hated then, end half century, I hate still. The thing mere folly; people concerned dead many years, yet present time I find considerable difficulty seeing merits person dress satin peculiar hue. "What it?" asked Ida. "It amber satin, snuff-coloured satin; one shades brown known name feuille-morte, dead-leaf colour. It pretty itself, yet I dislike it." "How funny," said Ida, wriggling arm-chair satisfaction. "Do tell it." "But funny least, unfortunately," said Mrs. Overtheway, laughing. "It is not really story, either. It even like Nurse's experiences. It strong remembrance childhood, is not worth repeating, could hardly amuse you." "Indeed, indeed, would," said Ida. "I like sound it. Satin different cooks." Mrs. Overtheway laughed. "Still, I wish I could think something entertaining," said she. "Please tell that," said Ida, earnestly; "I would rather hear something anything else." There resisting loving argument. Ida felt she gained her point, curled herself listening attitude accordingly. The hyacinth stood solemn sweetness listening also; Mrs. Overtheway, putting her little feet upon fender warm, began story ---- MRS. MOSS. "It move grief, see The trace human step departed, Because garden deserted, The blither place me! "Friends, blame not! narrow ken Hath childhood 'twixt sun sward: We draw moral afterward-- We feel gladness then." E. BARRETT BROWNING. "I remember," said Mrs. Overtheway, "old I am, I remember distinctly many unrecognized vexations, longings, disappointments childhood. By unrecognized, I mean vexations, longings, disappointments could understood nurses, confided even mothers, which, even cradles, become subject law humanity gives every heart secret bitterness endured alone. These sometimes outlive weightier memories, produce life-long impressions disproportionate value; oftener, perhaps, washed away advancing tide time--the vexations, longings, disappointments next period lives. These apt forgotten soon benefit children, forgetting make childhood bright look back upon, foster happy fancy one division mortal life greedy desire, unfulfilled purpose, envy, sorrow, weariness satiety, part, every man believes least happy child.

Then, again, I seem peep rusty iron gates house itself--an old red house, large windows, one could see white shutters always closed. To look house, though mind's eye, recalls feeling mysterious interest I looked fifty years ago, brings back almost oppressive happiness certain day, Sarah, business couple kept empty manor, took her, left explore grounds whilst she visited her friends. "Next companion rare sympathy mind mind, exceptional coincidence tastes, binds friendships chain mesmeric links, supplanting complacencies love intuition, companion whose desires occupations harmony, unison, one's own.

"I think fifty years ago, neither tastes excellent housemaid, Sarah, quite level I spoken; I remember feeling full comfort fact Sarah's love friendly gossip quite ardent mine romantic discovery; she disposed linger quite long chat I explore; she expected sit wearily her kitchen confidences, I imagined she would give long afternoon sharing day-dreams gardens deserted manor. "We ridden respective hobbies till nearly tea-time she appeared. "'I am afraid must tired waiting, Miss Mary,' said she. "'Tired!' I exclaimed, 'not least. I happy, I much obliged you, Sarah.' "Need I say I happy afternoon? Surely people felt--at least childhood--the fascination deserted gardens, uninhabited houses, ruined churches. They advantage familiar use undiscovered regions comfortable one traveller leaves explore them, secret concern facts do, wish possess. "If you, dear, open one drawers, find Nurse's Sunday dress folded corner, would hardly amuse you; if, instead thereof, found dress long stiff bodice, square neck, ruffled round sleeves, seen old pictures, matter old useless might be, would she would round atmosphere delightful mysterious speculations. This curiosity, fancies, roused ancient dress, whose wearer passed away, awakened equally empty houses someone must lived, though his place knows more. It manor. How often I peeped gates, catching sight garden walks, wondering whither led, walked them; seeing shutters behind one window partly open, longing look in. "To-day I walks peeped window. This happiness. "Through window I seen large hall marble floor broad stone stairs winding upwards unknown regions. By walks I arrived locked door kitchen garden, small wood wilderness endless delights (including broken swing), dilapidated summer-house. I wandered spongy lawn, cut long green promenade high clipt yew-hedges, walking which, olden times, ladies grew erect stately, plants among brushwood stretch air light.

I happy comfortable except one single vexation, this: "I slept little bed nursery, large room used workroom.

I tossed till clothes got hot, threw till I got cold, stopped ears, pulled sheet face, tried listen, listened spite all. They told long stories, made many jokes I could not understand; sometimes I heard names I knew, fancied I learnt wonderful secret. Sometimes, contrary, I made noises intimate I awake, one would rearrange glaring screen, advise go sleep; talked whispers, distracting still. "One evening--some months ramble round manor--the maids went tea, I lay peaceful silence watching shadows crept noiselessly room fire blazed, wishing Sarah her colleagues nothing less month uninterrupted tea-parties. I almost asleep Aunt Harriet came room. She brought candle, put screen (the red screen again!), went work-table. She rustling work things many minutes grandmother followed her, shut door air seemed promise long stay. She also gave shove screen, following conversation began: "'I Lady Sutfield's to-day, Harriet.' "'Indeed, madam.' But aunt respectfully continued her work, I could hear scraping scissors along table. "'I heard news there. The manor let.' "I almost jumped bed, Aunt Harriet's scissors paused. "'Let, madam! To whom!' "'To Mrs. Moss. You must heard speak her. I knew her years ago, young women. Anastatia Eden, she then.' "I could hear aunt move fire, sit down. "'The beautiful Miss Eden? Whom she marry last? Was love-affair knew about?' "'Her love-affairs endless. But mean Mr. Sandford. She treated ill--very ill.' "There pause, fire crackled silence; then, infinite satisfaction curiosity, Aunt Harriet said: "'I have forgotten story, madam. He poor, he not?' "'He quite enough marry on,' grandmother answered, energetically; 'but he great match. It old story, dear. The world! The world! The world! I remember sitting Anastatia ball, he her side evening. We sipped hot posset, talked partners. Ah, dear!' grandmother heaved sigh; partly, perhaps, follies youth, partly, perhaps, youth gone, could come back more. "'Anastatia talked him,' she continued.

"'Then she encourage him?' inquired Aunt Harriet; also moralized, indignation less philosophy. "'I believe she loved spite herself; last, he offered, she turned prudent refused him.' "'Poor man! Did he ever marry?' "'Yes, happily--a charming woman. But strange part story is, he came quite unexpectedly large property his family.' "'Did he? Then he would good match her admirers?' "'Better. It fine estate. Poor Anastatia!' "'Serve her right,' said aunt, shortly. "'She beautiful,' grandmother gently recommenced. She said this, precisely excuse, something sort her tone. 'Very beautiful!

"My aunt sniffed, partly depressing consciousness one degenerate generation, limited experience matter county balls; partly also express her conviction principle beauty. She said: "'Then Miss Eden married, madam?' "'Yes, rather late, Mr. Moss; wealthy Indian merchant, I believe. She lost her children, I know, one another, he died. Poor Anastatia! It seems like yesterday. And think she coming here!' "My grandmother sighed again, I held breath, hoping particulars lovely heroine romance. But I disappointed. My uncle's voice moment called loudly below, Aunt Harriet hurried conscious meritoriousness her, becoming lady married right man, took great care him. "'Supper, madam.

Besides this, I wanted hear stories lovely Mrs. Moss, ask soon she would come manor. After seconds grandmother rose toddled across room. I made effort, spoke breath: "'Granny!'

But individual added felicitous dispensation fortune personal attributes unparalleled beauty pea-green satin; worn hoops, high heels, powder; countless lovers, white brocade pink rosebuds--well might I sit, brain whirling anticipation, I thought: 'She coming here: I shall see her!' For though, course, I knew lived (so speak) pre-historic times grandmother young, Mrs. Moss must old woman; yet, strange may seem, dear, I assure I never realized fact. I thought her I heard her--young beautiful--and modelled hopes accordingly. "Most people's day-dreams take, sooner later, selfish turn. I seemed identify beautiful Anastatia. I thought ball one looks back past. I fancied moving _minuet de la cour_, whose stately paces scarcely made silken rosebuds rustle. I rejected _en masse_ countless suitors fabulous wealth nobility; came Mr. Sandford, I could feel Miss Eden more. My grandmother said she loved him, she encouraged him, she gave money. It mystery! In her place, I thought, I would danced every dance him! I would knitted winter, gathered flowers summer hedges. To one kind, one loves? To love, take pleasure giving pain--to balance true heart clear blue eyes money, prefer money--was time comprehensible me. I pondered, (so speak) spread subject mind, sat judgment upon it.

Alas! Sandy Tom home; I could imagine gentle rub head he would assented. Meanwhile, I made mind firmly one point. My grandmother wrong. Miss Anastatia Eden loved Mr. Sandford. "Smash! The fire, gradually becoming hollow, fell moment, I started find chilly cramped, lay down. Then thoughts took another turn. I wondered I grow beautiful, like Mrs. Moss. It serious question. I often looked glass, I general idea I looked much like little girls age. I began gravely examine detail, beginning top head. My hair light, cropped level lobes ears; this, however, would amend time; I long intended hair raven blackness, touch ground least; 'but till I grown up,' thought I. Then eyes: large; fact, undue proportions assumed I looked ill tired formed family joke. If size one requires eyes, mine would certainly pass muster. Moreover, long curly lashes. I fingered slowly, thought Sandy's whiskers. At point I nearly fell asleep, roused examine nose. My grandmother said Mrs. Moss's nose delicately curved. Now, certainly true curve may either concave convex; I heard bridge nose, knew well enough way curve go; I shrewd suspicion short nose mine, much round tip, could said curved all, curve went wrong way; time I could feel sure. For I must tell lie comfortable bed, hour long beyond time one ought naturally asleep, stroke one's nose, proceeding favourable forming clear judgment important point one's personal appearance. The shadows still well silent, fire ceased flicker, delicious quietude pervaded room, I stroked nose dozed, dozed stroked nose, lost sense shape, fancied huge lump growing fingers. The extreme unpleasantness idea prevented falling asleep; I roused sat again. "'It is use feeling,' I thought, 'I will look glass.' "There one mirror room. It hung mantelpiece. It old, deeply framed dark wood, hung slope forwards room. "In front fire stood old-fashioned, cushioned arm-chair, high back, many-frilled chintz cover. A footstool lay near it. It grandmother sitting. I jumped bed, put footstool chair I might get level glass, climbed it. Thanks slope mirror, I could see reflection well dim firelight would permit. "'What silly child!' say, Ida. Very silly, indeed, dear. And one remembers one's follies! At end half century, I recall reflection old nursery mirror clearly I remember I looked glass I put bonnet evening come tea you: weird, startled glance eyes, which, prominent stage weariness, gazed shadows looking glass, tumbled tufts hair, ghostly effect white night-dress. As nose, I could absolutely see nothing shape; firelight caught round tip, shone like little white toadstool gloom, all. "'One cannot see shape, full face,' I thought. 'If I another looking-glass.' "But another. I knew it, yet involuntarily looked round room. Suddenly I exclaimed aloud, 'Mr. Joseph do!' "Who Mr. Joseph?--you ask. My dear Ida, I really know. I least idea. I heard called Mr. Joseph, I fancy he connection family. All I knew his portrait, _silhouette_, elegantly glazed framed black wood, hung nursery wall. I ignorant his surname history. I never examined his features. But I knew happily he stout, since his ample coat waistcoat, cut black paper, converted glass covered excellent mirror dolls. "Worthy Mr. Joseph! Here he coming useful again. How much owe forefathers! I soon unhooked him, climbing back chair, commenced examination profile process double reflection. But vain! Whether owing dusty state mirror, dim light, unobliging shapeliness Mr. Joseph's person, I cannot say, but, turn twist I would, I could get view profile sufficiently clear complete form correct judgment upon. I held Mr. Joseph, high, low; I stooped, I stood tiptoe, I moved forward, I leant backward. It latest manoeuvre aggravated natural topheaviness chair, endangered balance. The fore-legs rose, spasmodic struggle made wrong direction, I, arm-chair, Mr. Joseph fell backwards together. "Two us light enough, happily escaped unhurt. It arm-chair fell appalling crash, whether worse no, I could tell lay. As soon I little recovered shock, therefore, I struggled raise it, whilst Mr. Joseph lay helplessly upon ground, his waistcoat turned ceiling. "It thus aunt found us. "If Mr. Joseph I fallen together, one need wiser; lumbering arm-chair come bump startled sober trio supper dining-room below. "'What _is_ matter?' said Aunt Harriet. "I speechless. "'What doing?' "I could not speak; accumulating misfortune gradually overpowering me, I began cry. "'Get bed,' said Aunt Harriet. "I willingly obeyed, Aunt Harriet seated herself foot. "'Now, think speak, Mary,' she said quietly, 'and tell truth. What doing?' "One large tear rolled nose tip I feebly began-- "'I got chair--' "'Well?' said Aunt Harriet. "'--to look glass.' "'What for?' said Aunt Harriet. "Tears flowed unrestrainedly face I howled self-abasement-- "'To look shape nose.' "At point Aunt Harriet rose, and, turning her back rather abruptly, crossed room, picked Mr. Joseph. (I since reason believe she difficulty concealing fit laughter.) "'What picture for?' she inquired, still her back me. "'I could not see,' I sobbed, 'and I got Mr. Joseph help me.' "My aunt made reply, and, still carefully concealing her face, restored Mr. Joseph his brass nail great deliberation. "There nothing like full confession. I broke silence. "'Aunt Harriet, I awake Granny here, heard said.' "'You silly, naughty child,' aunt severely returned. 'Why do not go sleep sent bed?' "'I cannot,' I sobbed, 'with talking candles.' "'You have got screen,' said Aunt Harriet; I cannot tell why, somehow I lacked courage say red screen chief instrument torture! "'Well, go sleep now,' she concluded, 'and thankful you are hurt. You might killed yourself.' "Encouraged gracious manner she tucked up, I took short cut information I failed attain Mr. Joseph. "'Aunt Harriet,' I said, 'do think I shall ever beautiful Mrs. Moss?' "'I am ashamed you,' said Aunt Harriet. "I climbed treacherous arm-chair. I eschewed mirror. I left Mr. Joseph peace upon wall. I took trouble future prospects nose. But night day I thought Mrs. Moss. I found old cushion, sat it, gazing faded tints rosebuds, till I imagined stiff brocade beauty freshness. I took vigorous drawing fit; fill little book innumerable sketches Mrs. Moss. My uncle lent his paint-box, he will not; fancy portraits I made satisfactory even myself, failed spite cheeks blushing vermilion, spite eyes large brilliant lamp-black could make them, spite accurately curved noses pencil could produce. The amount gamboge Prussian blue I wasted vain efforts produce satisfactory pea-green, leaves day astonished admirer uncle's patience. At time I wished walk along road led dear manor, iron gates painted, garden made tidy, shutters opened; but, all, chief object desires accompany grandmother aunt first visit Mrs. Moss. "Once I petitioned Aunt Harriet subject. Her answer was-- "'My dear, would nothing amuse you; Mrs. Moss old woman.' "'Granny said she beautiful,' I suggested. "'So she was, dear, grandmother young.' "These similar remarks I heard heeded not. They add one wrinkle ideal Mrs. Moss: way whatever lessened desire seeing her. I never seen grandmother young, her ever seemed matter tradition; hand, Mrs. Moss presented imagination bloom youth beauty, and, say would, bloom youth beauty I expected see her still. "One afternoon, week arrival Mrs. Moss, I busy garden, I working hour more, I heard carriage wheels drive stop door. Could Mrs. Moss? I stole gently round position I could see without seen, discovered carriage caller, uncle's. Then Granny Aunt Harriet going out. I rushed coachman, asked going. He seemed way overpowered reply--'To manor, Miss.' "That Mrs. Moss, I left behind! I stood speechless bitter disappointment, grandmother rustled her best silk dress, followed Aunt Harriet uncle, who, he saw me, exclaimed: "'Why, there is little Mary! Why do not take her? I will bound she wants go.' "'I do, indeed!' I exclaimed, Cinderella-like tones. "'But Mrs. Moss old lady,' said Aunt Harriet, whose ideas upon children purely theoretical, could imagine interests apart children, toys definite amusements--'What could child herself?' "'Do!' said uncle, took rough cheery view life, 'why, look her, sure. And Mrs. M. old lady, there will Indian cabinets screens, japanned tables, knick-knacks, lap-dogs. Keep eyes open, Miss Mary. I have never seen good lady her belongings, I will stake best hat japan ware lap-dog. Now, soon dressed?' "Later life selfish element mixes largely admirations. A years thence, first interview object many fancies, I thought much appearance occasion, I see. I taken pains toilette. At time, desire see Mrs. Moss absorbing admit purely personal considerations. I dashed nursery, scrubbed hands face raw red complexion, brushed hair three strokes, secured things one sweep. I hastily pocketed pincushion red cloth, worked yellow silk spots, likeness strawberry. It pet treasure mine, I intended offering Mrs. Moss. I tied hood top stairs, fastened tippet hall, reached family coach three bounds common young animals. "'Halloa!' said uncle, his face carriage door. 'You have thanked yet.' "I flung arms round his starched neck-cloth. "'You are darling!' I exclaimed, emphatic squeeze. "'You are another,' he replied, returning embrace upon hood. "With mutual understanding parted, I thought Mrs. Moss certain fulfil ideal, I wished her nearly like Uncle James circumstances case would permit. I watched his yellow waistcoat waving hands till could seen longer, I settled primly upon back seat, ventured upon shy conciliating promise 'very good.' "'You are quite welcome come, child,' said Aunt Harriet; 'but I said, neither children playthings you.' "Children playthings! What I want either? I put arm loop window watched fields came vanished, vacant eyes, thought Mrs. Moss. A dozen times I gone whole scene mind drove iron gates. I fancied bare, spacious hall, I peeped; I seemed hear light laugh, see beautiful face Mrs. Moss look banisters; hear rustle, scraping stiff brocade, pink rosebuds shimmered, green satin shoes peeped out, tap, tap, tap, high pink heels resounded shallow stairs. "I dreamed day-dream many times carriage stopped shake, Aunt Harriet roused me, asking I asleep. In another minute hall, I met first disappointment. "To begin with, I seen hall unfurnished, imagined otherwise. I pictured Mrs. Moss her beauty rose brocade, sole ornament cold emptiness. Then (though I knew grandmother aunt must present) I really fancied chief character interview Mrs. Moss. I thought rushing stairs meet her, laying pincushion her green satin feet. And last I really hall, I known again. It carpeted end end. Fragrant orange-trees stood tubs, large hunting-pictures hung upon walls, stood cases stuffed birds, presided footman livery, looked like stuffed specimen human race unusually bright plumage. "No face peeped banisters, went upstairs, footman went first (as seemed due him), grandmother, followed aunt, lastly I, humblest insignificance, behind them. My feet sank soft stair-carpets, I vacantly admired elegant luxury around me, odd sensation heartache. Everything beautiful, I wanted nothing beautiful Mrs. Moss. "Already vision began fade. That full-fed footman troubled fancies. His scarlet plush killed tender tints rosebuds thoughts, streaky powder upon his hair seemed mockery _toupêe_ I hoped see, whose whiteness enhance lustre rare black eyes. He opened drawing-room door announced grandmother aunt. I followed, (so far one may said face anything one stands behind skirts two intervening elders) I face face Mrs. Moss. "That is, I face face tall, dark, old woman, stooping shoulders, hooked nose, black eyes smouldered sunken sockets, distinct growth beard upon her chin. Mr. Moss dead many years, his widow laid aside her weeds. She wore dress _feuille-morte_ satin, black lace shawl. She rather elaborate cap, tendency get one side, perhaps would fit comfortably brown front bunchy curls fastened place band broad black velvet. "And Mrs. Moss! This end fancies! There nothing astonishing disappointment; marvel I indulged foolish fancy long. I told Mrs. Moss nearly old grandmother. As was, she looked older. Why--I could tell then, though I know now. "My grandmother, though never beauty, sweet smile her own, certain occasional kindling eyes, outward signs character full sentiment intelligence; outlasted youth. She always called 'pleasing,' she pleasing still. But Mrs. Moss strength, sentiment, intellect filled place beauty gone. Features powerful without character, eyes glowed without expression, formed wreck little recall loveliness bewildered Mr. Sandford--and me. "There much tell, Ida. This disappointment. This dislike certain shade _feuille-morte_ satin. It disappointed rose brocade I never see. You shall hear I got visit, however. This meeting, (like many meetings) proved reverse hoped. "Through angle Aunt Harriet's pelisse, I watched meeting grandmother Mrs. Moss. They kissed drew back looked other, still holding hands. I wondered grandmother felt I felt. I could tell. With one her smiles, she bent forward, and, kissing Mrs. Moss again, said: "'God bless you, Anastatia.' "'God bless you, Elizabeth.' "It first time Mrs. Moss spoken, her voice rather gruff. Then ladies sat down, grandmother drew her pocket-handkerchief wiped her eyes. Mrs. Moss began (as I thought) look hers, and, finding it, called, "'Metcalfe!' faded little woman, forefinger faded-looking book, came behind window-curtains, and, rummaging Mrs. Moss's chair practised hand, produced large silver snuff-box, Mrs. Moss took pinch, offered Granny, shook her head. Mrs. Moss took another larger pinch. It evident made her voice gruff. "Aunt Harriet introduced 'My daughter Harriet,' made stiff curtsey Mrs. Moss smiled, nodded, bade her 'sit down, dear.' Throughout whole interview she seemed looked upon ladies child, played part well, sitting prim silent her chair, I could hardly help humming I looked her: 'Hold head, Turn toes, Speak you are spoken to, Mend clothes.' I introduced, too, 'a grandchild,' made curtsey shadow Aunt Harriet's, received nod, shadow bestowed upon her, got way soon I could, behind aunt's chair, where, coming unexpectedly upon three fat pug-dogs mat, I sat among felt quite home. "The sight pugs brought Uncle James mind, I looked round room, seemed he must conjuror least, true everything he said. A large Indian screen hid door; japanned boxes stood little table correspond front it, two cabinets shallow drawers decorated handles, great deal glass, odd teacups, green dragons, Indian gods, Dresden shepherdesses visible upon shelves. The room filled knick-knacks, pug-dogs, less three them! They fat, little beauty except round heads black wrinkled snouts, I kissed again. "'Do mind Mrs. Moss's old, dressing hideous brown dress?' I asked whisper ear one round heads. 'Think rosebuds brocade, pea-green satin, high-heeled shoes. Ah!' I added, 'you pug, pugs do not think.' Nevertheless, I pulled pincushion, showed dog turn, sight forcibly reminded vain hopes, I could help crying. A hot tear fell upon nose oldest fattest pug, offended he moved away another mat distance, others fell fast asleep, I took refuge thoughts. "The question arose Mrs. Moss pincushion all? I expected her young beautiful, she proved old ugly, true; reason old ugly people cushions keep pins in. It struggle part dear strawberry pincushion circumstances, I fairly resolved so, rustle leave-taking began, I come corner. "'Bid Mrs. Moss good-day, Mary,' said grandmother; added, 'the child wild come see you, Anastatia.' "Mrs. Moss held her hand good-naturedly. 'So wanted see me, dear?' said she. "I took hand pocket, I holding pincushion, put Mrs. Moss's palm. "'I brought madam,' I said. 'It real strawberry; emery; I made myself.' "And fact sacrificed something Mrs. Moss made almost fond her. Moreover, expression her eyes moment gave beauty. She looked grandmother laid her hand head. "'I lost mine, Elizabeth.' "I thought she speaking her pincushions, generous mood, said hastily, "When worn out, madam, I make another.' "But she speaking her children. Poor Mrs. Moss! She took another huge pinch snuff, called, 'Metcalfe.' "The faded little woman appeared more. "'I must give keepsake return, dear,' said Mrs. Moss. 'The china pug, Metcalfe!' "Metcalfe (whose face always wore smile looked disappear, who, indeed, matter, always looked she disappear herself) opened one cabinets, brought little toy pug china, delicately coloured, looking like one friends mat. I fell love once, certainly handsome exchange strawberry pincushion. "'You send child see then, Elizabeth?' said Mrs. Moss retired. "In end Mrs. Moss I became great friends. I put aside dream among 'vain fancies' life, took kindly manor new aspect. Even stuffed footman became familiar, learnt welcome smile. The real Mrs. Moss agreeable person I have, I fear, represented her. She failed grasp solid happiness life, she chosen cowardice inferior mind; she borne disappointment dignity, submitted heavy sorrows patience; greater nature could done more. She soul good humour, love small chat, contrasted oddly her fierce appearance, fund entertainment me, I fed imagination stored memory anecdotes good old times many quiet evenings spent together. I learnt love her heartily, I confess, she bought new gown gave _feuille-morte_ satin Mrs. Metcalfe. "Mrs. Metcalfe 'humble companion' Mrs. Moss. She reality single, she exacted married title point respect. At beginning acquaintance I called her 'Miss Metcalfe,' occasioned check friendship ever received. Now I would, greatest pleasure, addressed her 'My Lord Archbishop,' style she entitled, matter profound indifference me. But question serious one her, serious she made it, till I almost despaired ever coming understanding subject. "On every point she unassuming almost non-entity. She weak-minded verge mental palsy. She benevolent deed, wandering conversation, one I met since. That is, ordinary life. In greenhouse garden (with she head-gardener alone real acquaintance) her accurate profound knowledge would put shame many professed garden botanists I met since. From her I learnt little I know science horticulture, her I spent many happy hours fine botanical works manor library, she alone ever opened. "And I became reconciled things were, though day I connect shade _feuille-morte_ satin disappointment forgotten." * * * * * "It dull story, not, Ida?" said little old lady, pausing here. She told precisely words, sum substance it. Ida nodded. Not she thought story dull, far she heard it, whilst she awake; she fallen asleep, she nodded. Mrs. Overtheway looked back fire, which, indeed, she talking time past. "A child's story?" she thought. "A tale blind, wilful folly childhood? Ah, soul! Alas, grown-up friends! Does moral belong childhood alone? Have manhood womanhood passionate, foolish longings, blind obvious truth, vanity lessen disappointment? Do still toil rosebuds, find _feuilles-mortes_?" No voice answered Mrs. Overtheway's fanciful questions. The hyacinth nodded fragrantly stalk, Ida nodded her chair. She fast asleep--happily asleep--with smile upon her face. The shadows nodded gently walls, like shadow little old lady stole quietly away. When Ida awoke, she found herself lying partly arm-chair, partly arms Nurse, lifting her up. A candle flared upon table, fire stood empty chair, heavy scent filled room sweet remembrance past happiness. The little old lady vanished, and, hyacinth, Ida would almost doubted whether her visit dream. "Has Mrs. Overtheway long gone, Nursey?" she asked, keeping her eyes upon flowerpot. "Ever long!" said Nurse, "and you have snoring away, old lady's downstairs, telling comfortably asleep, she is coming to-morrow evening, you are good." It precisely twelve minutes since Mrs. Overtheway left house, Nurse slightly exaggerative turn mind, people speak exactly subject time, especially opportunity triumphing someone asleep bed-time. The condition Ida's good also work Nurse's instructive fancy, Ida caught eagerly welcome news another visit. "Then she angry falling asleep, Nursey? I comfortable, she nice voice, I could not help it; I think I left pugs. I wish I pug wrinkled black snout, do not you, Nursey?" "I am sure I do not, Miss Ida. My father kept sorts pigs, used one black snout black spots, ugly ugly could be; I never could fancy bacon would fit eat. You must dreaming, I am sure; old lady would never tell rubbish, I know." "It is pugs, pigs, Nursey; they are dogs, know," said Ida, laughing. "How funny are! And indeed she tell me, I could not dreamt it; I never dreamt anything nice life." "And never will, likely," said Nurse, skilful concluding subject she want discuss, apt rapid twist line argument, Ida would find somewhat bewildering. "But, dear Miss Ida," she continued, "do leave clutching chair-arm, I am lifting up; eyes  will drop head, go staring like that." Ida relaxed nervous grasp, she impelled her energy subject pugs, let her eyebrows, submitted undressed. The least pleasant part ceremony may comprised word curl-papers. Ida's hair dark, soft, smooth, little girls wore ringlets, little girl must wear ringlets too. To end her hair every night put curl-papers, much tight twisting sharp jerking, Ida slept upon irregular layer small paper parcels, made pillows mockery. With this, however, damp day, good romp, would sometimes undo night's work, great disgust Nurse. In her last place, young lady's hair curled damp brush, Ida well knew, Nurse made much her grievance, use curl-papers, place left Ida's grievance sleep upon them. She submitted night therefore, nights, patience, sat swinging her feet accommodating her head sharp tugs, always seemed come unexpected quarters. Perhaps, however, her mind may running little upon grievances, made her say: "You know, Nursey, always telling I ought thankful things, things, and--" "I wish you would talk sense, give way head I pull, Miss Ida," retorted Nurse, "having things, things; I do not know mean." "Well, know, Nursey, day I said I did not like bread-and-treacle treacled long before, soaked in, said I ought thankful I bread-and-treacle all, I had not wooden leg, eat anything I could get, like old sailor man corner; well, know, I have thought something I _am_ thankful for, I have not red screen bed." "I really think, Miss Ida," said Nurse, "that you will go mind day, outlandish fancies. And get them, I cannot think. I am sure _I_ never put things head." Ida laughed again. "Never mind, Nursey, belongs pug story. Am I done now? And you have tucked up, please, would mind remembering put flower I see I wake?" Nurse she asked, Ida watched hyacinth till she fell asleep; she slept well. In morning she took her old post window. The little old lady never seemed long making her appearance, bells slow begin. Chim! chime! chim! chime! There last, Mrs. Overtheway. She looked up, waved bunch snowdrops, went bells. Ida kissed her hand, waved again, long little old lady sight. "There is kiss you, dear Mrs. Overtheway," she cried, "and kisses flowers, house, everything belonging you, bells church, everybody morning, and--" But, point universal benevolence, Nurse carried her breakfast. The little old lady came tea before. She looked well ever, Nurse equally generous matter tea toast. Mrs. Overtheway told Ida missed story Mrs. Moss, Ida apologized, earnest distress, her uncivil conduct falling asleep. "There I snoring away, telling delightful story!" she exclaimed, penitently. "Not snoring exactly, dear," smiled little old lady, "but looked happy." "I thought Nursey said so," said Ida. "Well, I am glad. It would rude. And know I do not know was, I _am_ fond stories; I like nothing well." "Well, shall I try again?" said Mrs. Overtheway. "Perhaps I may find amusing one, put sleep, will not harm. Indeed, I think doctor say I am good company you." "You good! That _I_ tell him," said Ida, fervently, "and please let again, remember anything. I like true stories." "Talking snoring," said Mrs. Overtheway, "reminds something happened youth, true, though, know, ghost story." Ida danced her chair. "That I like!" she exclaimed. "Nurse ghost story, belonging farm-house, she tells housemaid, she says she cannot tell till I older, I like hear ghost story, is not horrid." "This ghost story is not horrid, I think," laughed little old lady, "and let think minutes, forgive prosy way telling it, shall once." There pause. The little old lady sat silent, sat Ida also, her eyes intently fixed Mrs. Overtheway's face, occasional smile passing. "It is ghost snored," said little old lady, doubtfully. "Delicious!" responded Ida. The two friends settled comfortably, words told following story:-- THE SNORING GHOST. _Clown._ Madman, thou errest: I say darkness Ignorance, thou art puzzled Egyptians fog.... What opinion Pythagoras concerning wild fowl? _Malvolio._ That soul grandam might haply inhabit bird. _Clown._ What thinkest thou his opinion? _Malvolio_. I think nobly soul, way approve his opinion. _Twelfth Night_, iv. 2. "I remember," said Mrs. Overtheway, "I remember first visit. That is, I remember occasion I sister Fatima did, first time lives, go visiting without mother, grown-up person take care us." "Do remember mother?" asked Ida. "Quite well, dear, I thankful say. The best kindest mothers!" "Was father alive, too?" Ida asked, sigh. The old lady paused, pitying anxious little face opposite, Ida went eagerly: "Please tell _he_ like." "He good deal older mother, married early. He learned man. His tastes accomplishments many various, he young-hearted enthusiastic pursuit his life. He apt take one subject interest another, time completely absorbed it. And, I must tell you, whatever subject might be, long his head full it, house seemed full too. It influenced conversation meals, habits household, names pet animals, even children. I called Mary, fever chivalrous enthusiasm fair luckless Queen Scotland, Fatima received her name study Arabic brought eastern mania. My father wished call her Shahrazád, renowned sultana 'Arabian Nights' he called upon curate arrange baptism, worthy man flatly rebelled. A long discussion ended father's making list eastern names, curate selected Fatima least repugnant sobriety parish registers. So Fatima she called, she grew pale, moon-faced, dark-eyed, name became her well." "Was Fatima went visiting you?" asked Ida. "Yes, dear; visit. The invitation came thirteenth birthday. "One's birthday generally day importance. A notable day whilst one young, less one old, one carried quickly last stages life, seems hardly worth count time near end journey. Even youth, however birthdays important others. I remember looking forward tenth birthday high point dignity advancement; pride occasion I first wrote age figures one. With similar feelings, I longed thirteen. The able write age two figures not, all, she would special lustre upon life; I 'in teens' must 'feel different somehow.' So I thought. Moreover, birthday really bring solid advantages. I allowed read certain books grown-up character I read hitherto, sit till nine of the clock. I wear sandals shoes. My hair henceforth grow long I Fates would permit, skirts frocks take inch direction. 'In four years,' I said Fatima, sat eve birthday, discussing manifold advantages, 'in four years I shall grown up. Miss Ansted introduced seventeen.' The prospect illimitable. "'Do people always grow much birthdays?' asked one little ones. I boasted nursery, I thirteen I 'nearly grown up,' I hardly outlived idea one's birthday one year older previous day, might naturally expect made year's growth night. "This birthday, however, produced striking change. As usual, presents charming; wreath lovely Fatima's deft fingers could make it, general holiday pleasure-making almost much good thing. Otherwise, little mark days year. "Towards evening sitting grass, boys heads sisters' laps, outcry story, one responded; partly, perhaps, exquisite air evening seemed sufficient delight, stillness profound lightly disturbed. We remained time without speaking, idea becoming general among girls boys napping, summer silence broken distant footfalls horse upon high road. "'Trotting!' observed one supposed sleepers. We not, family, given explanations, drew breaths evening air silence. Then someone said: "'We might make story _that_, fancy sorts things. Who it? Where he come from, he going to?' "'It messenger seat war,' drawled boy lap, without moving. Then, lifting his curly head moment, he cried, 'To horse! gentlemen, horse! The enemy Carter's Mill midnight!' "There pause; solitary footfalls came nearer evening mists, small brother, quaint turn mind, much given study historical portions Old Testament, sat said, slowly: "'It one Job's messengers. _The Chaldeans made three bands, fell upon camels, carried away, yea, slain servants edge sword; I escaped alone tell thee._' "The others boys laughed, he lay again, solemnly he risen. "'That foot-messenger,' said boy, contemptuously. "'It does not say so,' retorted small brother. "'Well, way, camels carried off--so he ride upon?' "A squabble imminent. I covered boy's face handkerchief, keep quiet. "'Listen!' I said. 'It is post. The mail north stopped highway, he saved bags, riding hard London.' "'It is--' "But new suggestion drowned general shout of-- "'It is coming lane!' "The footfalls diverged main road, coming sandy lane skirted wall. The boys lifted heads, sat expectant. There pause, familiar gate-click, footfalls broke upon carriage-road, close us. A man livery, upon well-groomed horse--nothing more, rather uncommon sight us. Moreover, man his livery strange, horse looked tired. "This event broke sitting, strolling house, maid met us, saying mother wished see Fatima. "We found mother sewing, opened letter beside her. It written one large quarto sheets use, covered crossed, every available corner, vague, scratchy hand. "'I heard old friend mine, Mary,' said mother. 'She come live twelve miles here. There something letter Fatima, may read part aloud, can. The top last page.' "I found place, and, difficulty, deciphered: 'The dear Major delicacy consideration--' "'No, no!' said mother, 'the next sentence.' "'Dear Cecilia sweetness. The dress was--' "My mother took letter, found right place herself, I read: "'If cannot come yourself, least let us renew acquaintance children. I think two girls thirteen? My Lucy, dear child fifteen, feels keenly loss her sister, young companions would boon, company _elders_. Pray send them. They come coach, shall met Durnford, Elephant Castle.' "'Is sister dead?' asked Fatima, pityingly, discussed personal interest subject. "'Oh, no! married,' said mother. "It decided go. This decision arrived once, without ups downs. My mother could go herself, doubts old enough, yet, go visiting alone. It believed I made much able say--'But know, I thirteen, now.' "Next day, evening, father busy his study, mother sat open window, Fatima her feet. The letter acceptance duly sent messenger, she yet good deal advice give, doubts express. She one people cannot sit idle fingers, she talked she knitted. We found easy enough sit idle upon two little footstools, listening dear kind voice, watching two little clouds, fragments larger group, detached themselves, sailing slowly alone across heavens. "'They like us two,' Fatima whispered me; 'perhaps going see clouds.' "'I observed two things apt befall young people go visiting,' said mother, she turned row her knitting, 'one is, neglect little good habits away, is, make disagreeable come back.' "The clouds drifted on, mother continued her knitting, arming us many wise counsels small matters connected great event; Fatima I gratefully gave half minds, whilst half made rosy pictures unparalleled excellence trying circumstances, which, hereafter, prove warnings counsels been, case, unnecessary superfluous. "'Most families people,' said mother, 'have little good habits customs feel bound keep, although among great general duties bind every one. So long young people home, matters often simple enough, go away certain difficulties arise. They go amongst people whose little habits accustomed. Sometimes come uncharitable conclusions upon friends' characters consequence. And, I must say, I never met one could severe young people age apt be. I remember myself, I seen many girls. Home naturally standard, whatever different seems wrong. As life goes on, young critics learn (or learn) distinguish general particular duties; also coming know larger number people, find good persons cut pattern, one's friends' little ways therefore absurd, one happen used them. On hand, going amongst people may tempt critical little habits, also apt make neglect own. Perhaps think cannot much matter, great duties, people seem get quite well without them. But one learns end, character value formed without discipline individual rules, rules use held circumstances. "Charitable others, severe himself," seems maxim grown-up people grown-up things; but, I believe, little daughters, doubts difficulties life begin early, earlier commonly provided against; I think innumerable girls struggle miserably practice duty, radical ignorance principles, earlier learnt, smaller burden regret one heaps together oppress future, sooner one finds peace mind common even amongst young, should-be light-hearted.' "In these, words effect, dear mother prepared us first plunge society. We discussed little good habits maintain, and, amongst others, certain little Sunday customs--for away week. "'We cannot take good habits us, will not come,' I said. 'What become Sunday readings?' "For mother used read us every Sunday evening, middle book wondrous fascination--'The Pilgrim's Progress.' "'If others, would trust us it,' said Fatima, thoughtfully, 'we might take book us, Mary might read me, she would--I like her reading.' "My mother consented. There another copy house, though volume favourite, she said time learnt take care valuable books. So settled. We talked evening; clouds drifted sight. "'They gone bed big dark cloud side' said Fatima, yawning; went bed also. "My story wanders, Ida; old woman's tale. Old people age become prosy, dear. They love linger little remembrances youth, recall good counsels kind voices long silent. But I must put sleep second time, I describe lists good habits Fatima I drew fine Roman characters, kept good resolutions never kept before. We borrowed red ink, make impressive eye, and, unfortunately, spilt it. A bad beginning, many rules reference tidiness. Neither I give full account packed. How preparations began once, stopped necessity setting day arrived. How emptied drawers cupboards, disarranged bookshelves; and, making ready life order tidiness live abroad, passed week home room chaos never before. How prepared amount spare time, experience eventually teaches one found visiting; and, object, took sewing performed month home; books, touched years; drawings, fated touched, more. "I describe big box, father lent us, joys packing it. How Fatima's workbox dove-tailed desk. How books (not chosen reference great event) awkward sizes, make comfortable paving bottom trunk; whilst folded stockings may called packer's delight, usefulness fill corners. How, packed whole week long, barely ready, good deal flurried last moment; took available property us, left key trunk behind. Fancy yourself, green coach picked us toll-bar, how, jingled on, felt first qualm home-sickness, and, stretching heads hands window, waved adieux kisses innumerable Home, regardless fellow-traveller corner, old gentleman, yellow silk handkerchief his head, proved end pleasant companion. I remember told family history, minutest particulars, conjugated four regular Latin verbs his orders; he rewarded confidences learning clear, sweet, amber-coloured sticks barley-sugar I ever good fortune meet with. I remember also how, warmth new friendship, Fatima unveiled future, which, joke father's, laid ourselves. "I marry Sultan, I moon-faced; Mary linguist, she large eyes.' "'Then Miss Mary marry?' said old gentleman, grim smile. "I shook head sage disdain. 'When I sixteen, I shall Amazon.' "Precisely I meant I do not think I knew myself, dreams odd compound heroic fairy lore, love ambition learning simply inheritance. Many night I fancy master languages world, hunting windy hills dress Lincoln green. I mighty contempt men, high respect myself, greatest many follies. "After interesting revelations barley-sugar round, coach rattled Durnford. "Shall I tell met Elephant Castle footman gentlemanlike appearance (his livery excepted), who, sagacity somewhat puzzled us, discovered 'the young ladies expected,' led us carriage, firmly opposing efforts fulfil last home orders I received, 'look box?' How carriage found lady handsomely dressed black, came meet us, seemed anxious comfort, much interested arrival, naturally supposed her lady invited us, till discovered she lady's maid; arriving found hostess quite another sort person, appearance particularly interested arrival, I since found case heads country houses. "It large house, reminding Manor within, prettier outside; old irregularly built, mullioned windows, odd wings corners. A glowing, well-kept garden contrasted prettily grey stone, grounds seemed magnificent eyes. "We shown drawing-room, real lady house sat dainty writing-table, scratching away letter doubt affectionate one mother received. She shortsighted, seemed case also ladies room; this, perhaps, stared hard us, went elaborate pieces needlework engaged. It seemed take hostess second two see us, another second two recall were; she came forward kindly, showed us sit, asked mother. Whilst I replying, she crossed fire-place, rang bell; I felt slightly surprised her seeming wish news her old friend. She asked pleasant journey, Fatima hardly pronounced modest yes, she begged would allow her finish her letter, went back spindle-legged table. Whilst she scratched looked around us. Three four ladies room, less young, less pretty, less elegantly dressed, less elaborate pieces needlework. There one gentleman, young dark, large brown eyes, seemed employed making paper pellets old letter, chatting low voice young lady good deal red hair. We afterwards found he Irishman, familiarly called 'Pat' young ladies, seemed related him. We seen man-servant appeared door. "'Where Miss Lucy, Thompson?' hostess asked, sharply. "'I inquire, madam,' Thompson replied, utmost softness, vanished. "The scratching began again, Irishman went gently chatting, felt like horrid dream. Then Thompson reappeared. "'Miss Lucy out, madam.' "'Did she know time young ladies arrive?' "'Miss Lucy knew carriage gone meet them, madam.' "'Very thoughtless! Very thoughtless indeed!' said lady. Thompson paused respectfully, receive full weight remark, vanished noiselessly before. "There awkward pause. Our hostess left scratching, looked cross; Irishman fired one his pellets across room, left chatting, red-haired young lady got up, rustled across us. I remember her well, Ida, fell deeply love her her kindness. I remember her green white dress. She fair round face, pleasant really pretty, white starlike forehead, almost firm mouth, gentle voice, least, thought, she said: "'As Lucy out, may I take young ladies room?' "Our hostess hesitated, murmured something Bedford, lady's maid. The starlike forehead contracted, red-haired young lady said, rather emphatically: "'As Lucy receive her friends, I thought I might perhaps supply her place.' "'Well, dear Kate, kind,' said hostess, 'I must finish letters.' "'The yellow room?' said young lady, abruptly, swept us without parley. The Irish gentleman opened door us, staring half-puzzled, half-amused look lofty air young lady passed out. He followed us hall, left discharging his remaining pellets furniture, whistling 'Kathleen Mavourneen,' clearly bird. "The yellow room large airy one, white painted wainscoting, huge four-post bed yellow curtains, pretty view windows. In middle floor saw box standing dignity, uncorded, ready. Then terrible fact broke upon minds key left behind. My sufferings seconds I found courage confide misfortune new friend considerable. When I tell her, calmness good nature she received confession surprising delightful. "'The lock does not look uncommon one, she said, she opened door. 'I dare say I may find key fit it.' "'What is matter?' said voice outside. It Irish gentleman. She explained. "'Keys?' said Irish gentleman; 'got lots pocket, besides totally unnecessary, I am capital hand lock-picking. Let see.' "With he slipped in, seeming quite much his ease drawing-room, another second squatted upon floor box, he seemed quite comfortable arm-chair he left. Here he poked, fitted, whistled, chatted without pause. "'I have locks keys everything I possess' he cheerfully remarked; 'and I never lock anything, there is damage done keys left behind, good thing, see, I always leave everything everywhere.' "'Do make principle it?' asked young lady, coldly. "'I am afraid I make practice it.' He opened box, leaning bed-post, roguish twinkle his brown eyes, faded, however, silent severity red-haired young lady, gave place look melancholy might melted granite, he added: "'I am alone, see, that is it. I believe I am neatest creature breathing, I would somebody keep it.' "Neither his hardened untidiness his lonely lot seemed, however, weigh heavily his mind; he withdrew whistling, his notes heard passages little time. When died away distant part house, red-haired young lady left us also. "I shall give lengthened account unpacking, dear Ida; though enjoyable, less protracted packing-up been. How revelled spacious drawers cupboards, queens, strictly followed one mother's wise counsels--'unpack bottom box once, however short visit may be; saves time end.' We unpack lowest book (an artificial system memory, I long purposing study, I thought find spare moments get here, which, I may well confess, I look visit, learnt day). We divided shelves pegs fairness, final triumph found use elaborate watch-pockets hung pillows. They rich unlimited expenditure quilled ribbon, must given great deal trouble someone many serious occupations life. Fatima I wished watches put them, till happy thought suddenly struck one us, could keep respective papers good habits. "Bedford came whilst midst labours, warmly begged us leave everything her, she would put things away us. The red-haired young lady sent her, she became mainstay practical comfort us visit. She seemed humanity conventions drawing-room. From her got incidental meals hungry, spirits wine Fatima's tooth ached, warnings near late breakfast, little modern fashionable turns hair clothes, familiar anecdotes household others she lived. I remember her gratitude. "Miss Lucy came home putting away fairly finished, tea her schoolroom. She slight, sharp, lively young lady, looking older fifteen us, rather pretty, self-possessed. She scanned us head foot first met, I felt her eyes found defects innumerable, seemed less likely, she also shortsighted. As her governess away visiting sick relative, Miss Lucy honours schoolroom. She cold inattentive first, became patronizing tea, ended gracious. In her gracious mood she affectionate confidential. She called us 'my dear girls,' put her arms round us sat dark, chattered without pause herself, her governesses, her sister, her sister's husband. "'A wedding house,' she observed, 'is good fun, particularly take principal part it. I chief bride's-maid, know, dear girls. But I will tell whole affair first. You know I never bride's-maid before, I could not make mind I like dresses,' etc., etc. And got story Miss Lucy's costume, called dress go downstairs. "'What going put on?' she asked, balancing herself door peering in. "'White muslin!' said pride, new frocks, splendid eyes. "'I many muslins, I tired them,' she said; 'I shall wear pink silk to-night. The trimming came London. Perhaps I may wear muslin to-morrow; I Indian one. But shall see dresses to-morrow, dear girls.' "With she left us, put new frocks (which _the_ evening dresses visit) depressed spirits. This owing thought pink silk, possibility surfeit white muslin. "During evening learnt another Miss Lucy's peculiarities. Affectionate she alone together, she sooner among grown-up young ladies downstairs she kept much she permitted, seemed forget us altogether. Perhaps fit particularly short sight attacked her; she seemed look us, away us, side us, anywhere us, quite unconscious existence. The red-haired young lady made her fetch us large scrap-book, sat eyes, soft monotonous chit-chat hostess ears, she talked worked elder ladies sofa. It seemed long gossip, particular end beginning, tatting, trimmings, military distinction, linens, servants, honourable conduct, sentiment, settlements, expectations, Bath waters, finely blended. From constant mention Cecilia dear major, evident late wedding subject discourse; indeed, matter, remained prime topic conversation stay. "Cecilia dear major Bath, letters read aloud breakfast-table. I remember wondering deep interest ladies seemed take bride's pretty flow words fashions, drives, pump-room, long lists visitors' names; this, too, without connection hearers people places mentioned. When anybody recognize name, however, she knew anything, seemed like finding treasure. All ladies bore upon once, dug family history farthest known point, divided subject among them. Miss Lucy followed letters closely, remembered wonderfully, though (as I afterwards found) she never seen Bath, knew people mentioned little hearsay facts she gathered former letters. "It useful art, dear Ida, one I sadly failed life, able remember related whom, watering-place family went summer last, common friends met there, etc. But, like arts, demands close attention, forbids day-dreaming, takes good deal time. "'_Wasn't_ odd,' said Miss Lucy, one morning breakfast, 'that Cecilia major meet Hicksons!' "'Who Hicksons?' I asked. "'Oh! dear girl, do not remember, Cecilia's last letter, her telling us lady she met shop town, buying shawl counterpart her own? seems odd turn Bath, nice people! Do not remember mamma said must family Colonel Hickson engaged girl one eye, she caught small-pox got much marked, he broke off?' "'Small-pox one eye would look ugly,' Fatima languidly observed; subject drifted rest. "One afternoon, I remember, chanced left alone hostess drawing-room. No one else happened way talk to, good lady talked us. We clever girls age, I fancy, used talk good deal mother; rate attentive listeners, I think hostess required much us. I think she glad anybody heard whole affair beginning end, she put her feet sofa, started afresh complete history her dear Cecilia cradle; gone major, his military exploits abroad, his genteel connections home, tendency gout family troubled times, sad anxiety her dear child, visitors announced. "Our intelligent attention gained favour us; introduced ladies 'daughters dear friend mine, I seen years,' one lady gave sweet glance tight smile murmured: "'So pleasant renew acquaintance children;' ladies gave sweet glances, tight smiles also, echoed: "'So pleasant!' "'Such sensible girls!' said hostess, there; 'like women fifty. So like dear mother! Such treasures little Lucy! You know she lost her dear sister,' etc., etc. "For ladies drew together, hostess got fresh audience, retired distant arm-chairs, good deal bewildered. "But return first evening. "Miss Lucy retired together, sooner drawing-room door closed behind us, she wound her arms round waists, became devoted side side whole evening. "'I will tell I will do, dear girls,' she said reached room; 'I will come sleep (there is lots room three), I go Cecilia's affair, do not finish to-night go to-morrow morning get up. I always wake early, I call you. I will come back I am ready bed.' "And she vanished. "We bed she returned. Her hair undergoing wonderful process, stowed away large elaborate night-cap. "'Bedford slow,' said she; 'and then, know, I got bed, let her tidy room, she fairly gone, I got, I am. We shall comfortable possible; I will middle, I side me, dear girls;' she sprang. "'Did notice this?' she asked, holding her hand, pointing edging sleeve her night-dress; 'it is new pattern; know it? Oh! dears, yards yards tatting Cecilia her trousseau!' "Fatima I rich tatting edges, rejoiced conversation took another turn. "'About proposal,' she rambled on; 'do know I do not really know whereabouts Henry (that major, brother-in-law,' she added, one little attacks dignity she subject) 'proposed he said. I asked Cecy, she would not tell me. She cross, often; I am glad she is married. I think sisters ought marry fast can; never get well house together, know.' "I fairly gasped idea, Fatima said bluntly: "'There lots us, get on.' "'Ah!' said Miss Lucy, tones wisdom; 'wait till you are little older, you will see. Cecy school two sisters hated like poison, obliged dress alike, younger wore her things much faster one, she obliged wear till her sister's done. She used wish her sister would marry, Cecy said, best fun is, they are love man. He is curate church go to.' "'Which he love with?' I asked. "'Oh, neither I know of,' said Miss Lucy, composedly. 'They do not know him, know; sit close pulpit, struggles shall get corner pew that is nearest. Cecy I were not like that; still I am glad she is married. Now was not stupid her tell me? I never told anybody, know. And do not wonder gentlemen say, say it? He could not propose sitting, I think standing would awkward. I suppose he knelt. Aunt Maria does not approve gentlemen kneeling; she says it is idolatry. I think must look silly. Cecy would not even tell he said. She said he spoke mamma, mamma said his conduct highly honourable; I think stupid. Do know, dears, I cousin really married Gretna Green? She married officer. He splendidly handsome; people said things him, her parents objected. So eloped, went Wales, lovely place! Was not romantic? They quarrelled afterwards though; he lives abroad now. People ought careful. I shall careful myself; I mean refuse first offers I get.' "And Miss Lucy rambled on, perfectly unconscious melancholy yet ludicrous way she degraded serious subjects, she old enough understand, wise enough reverence. We young see fully, her frivolity jarred upon us, though she amused us, excited curiosity. She worse many girls, plenty inquisitiveness sharp sense, much refinement feeling; whose accomplishments learnt 'first masters,' whose principles left picked gossip, servants, second-rate books; digested ignorant, inquisitive, undisciplined minds. "I will not try recall it, dear Ida. I remember continuous stream unedifying gossip, varied small boastings her family. We have many connections, favourite phrase Miss Lucy's, seemed mean great deal. 'Do like making trees?' she asked. I getting sleepy, without much thought replied, 'I love trees beyond anything, I like growing oak trees bottles.' Miss Lucy's, 'My dear girl, I mean family trees, genealogical trees,' patronizing scorn. 'Ours spring drawer big oak cabinet drawing-room,' she added. 'We descended King Stephen.' "I believe I first fall asleep night. The last words I remember hearing were: 'We have many connections.' "The next day's post brought news Bath general interest household. The plans Cecilia major changed; coming her mother's following Monday. "'My dear girls, I _am_ glad!' said Miss Lucy; 'you will see them. But move room, I am sorry say.' "And next twelve hours Miss Lucy descriptive her family glories general, glories her sister brother-in-law particular, ever. "Sunday day mixed experiences us; pleasant reverse. Miss Lucy her best clothes almost intolerably patronizing, general stiffness seemed pervade everything, ladies' silk dresses included. After breakfast dawdled till time dress church, ladies took five minutes allowed for, seemed likely late. At last moment, Miss Lucy lost her Prayer Book, till another five minutes gone search she remembered left church Sunday before. This settled stowed away carriages drove off. It short drive; came sight quaint little church sound bells, became evident late. In porch shook dresses, Irishman divided burden Prayer Books he gallantly bearing, hostess turned back half-open door say loud encouraging whisper, 'It is Confession;' swept little church huge square pew. "My dear Ida, I must tell brought horror late service, point father called 'very particular.' Fatima I therefore felt greatly discomposed late disturbing entrance, though way blame. We also taught kneel prayers, uncomfortable sensation doubt shame-facedness saw one lady another sit bend her bonnet her lap, hesitated follow customs face majority. But red-haired young lady seemed fated help us difficulties. She sank her knees corner pew, her green silk falling round her; knelt her side, question settled. The little Irishman cast doubtful glance her moment, sat down, bending his head deeply his hat. We went similar process responding, seem fashion hostess her friends. The red-haired young lady held her customs, however, held her. Our responses less conspicuous, good deal drowned voice old gentleman next pew. Diversity seemed prevail manners congregation. This gentleman stood prayers, balancing huge Prayer Book corner pew, responding loud voice, devout tuneful, keeping exact time parson also, he grudge clerk felt due keep advance him. I remember, Ida, came in, he saying, 'those things ought _not_ done,' he said terrible voice, took glance us his gold-rimmed spectacles, I wished massive pulpit-hangings would fall bury confusion. When text sermon given out, hostess rustled up, drew curtains well round pew. Opposite me, however, gap I could see old gentleman. He settled facing pulpit, sat gazing preacher rigid attention seemed say--'Sound doctrine, please; I eye you.' "We returned came. "'Is afternoon service?' I asked Miss Lucy. "'Oh, yes!' reply, 'the servants go afternoon.' "'Do not you?' I asked. "'Oh, no!' said Miss Lucy, 'once enough. You go maids, want to, dears,' she added, one occasional touches insolence she indulged. "Afternoon arrived, I held consultation Fatima do. "When roused, Fatima resolute I. "'Of course we will go,' said she; 'what is use written good rules sticking this? We always go twice home. Let us look Bedford.' "On mission I set forth, I reached top stairs I caught sight red-haired young lady, her bonnet shawl, standing open door, Prayer Book her hand. I dashed downstairs, entered hall Irishman came another door. In his hand Prayer Book also, he picked his hat, went smiling towards her. But he approached young lady, she looked much annoyed--not say cross--that I hesitated go forwards. "'Are going church?' said little Irishman, pleased look. "'I do not know,' said young lady, briefly, 'are you?' "'I was--' he began, stopped short, looking puzzled vexed. "'Is else going?' he asked, moment's pause. "'No one else ever go,' she said, impatiently, moved hall. "The Irishman coloured. "'I habit going twice myself, though may think it,' he said, quietly; 'my poor mother always did. But I pretend go good purpose she did, would, lie us--' and, without finishing his sentence, he threw his book (not gently) table, and, lifting his hat he passed her, dashed garden. "I understand little scene, but, soon he gone, I ran ask friend she going church, would take us. She consented, I went back triumph Fatima. As time lose, dressed quickly enough; I rather surprised, went down, find Irish gentleman, his face restored usual good humour, standing friend, holding her Prayer Book well his own. The young lady speak, but, cheerfully remarking plenty time us, he took books also, set forth. "I remember walk well, Ida! The hot, sweet summer afternoon--the dusty plants pathway--the clematis hedges (I put bit Prayer Book, years)--the grasshoppers flies dresses caught long grass, reappeared sat sermon. "The old gentleman his pew, his glance almost benevolent, as, good time, took places. We (literally) _followed_ his example much heartiness responses; and, he looked pew prayers (and his position he could hardly avoid it), he must seen even Irishman rejected compromises, knelt together. "There one feature service forgotten. When sermon ended, I lost sight last grasshopper hasty rising, found hymn. It old custom church conclude Evening Prayer. No one seemed use book--it Bishop Ken's evening hymn, everyone knew, and, I think, everyone sang. But feature us Irishman began sing. From her startled glance, I think even red-haired young lady known he possessed beautiful voice. It clearness without effort, tone, truth, pathos, I often heard. It sounded strangely nasal tones school-children, scraping solitary fiddle. Even neighbour, lustily followed rhythm tune, though without much varying note he responded, softened his sounds turned look Irishman, sang without noticing it, till, last verse, he seemed disturbed discover many eyes him. Happily, self-consciousness come late. The hymn ended. "We knelt Benediction, went back summer fields. "The red-haired young lady talked little. Once she said: "'How never heard sing?' "To Irishman replied: "'I do not understand music, I sing ear; I hate 'company' performances. I sing whenever like.' "'Mary,' said Fatima, room again, 'I believe two marry day.' "'So I,' I answered; 'but do not say anything Lucy.' "'No, indeed!' said Fatima, warmly. So kept idea sacred Miss Lucy's comments--why, I think either us could told words. 'Pity, pleasant impressions--pity, impressions--pass away soon! * * * * * "The evening altogether satisfactory afternoon been. First, Miss Lucy took us see her sister's wedding-presents, still her mother's keeping. They splendid, Miss Lucy eloquent. From dawdled her room, she displayed her treasures, running commentary matters taste fashion, lasted till time dress evening, she made usual inquiry, 'What shall put to-night, dear girls?' blushed nothing limited toilettes reveal. "In drawing-room, similar subjects conversation awaited us. Our hostess her friends seem care much reading, and, work Sunday evening, talked more. The chatter ran chiefly upon Bath fashions, upon ball held somewhere, somebody dressed manner appeared needful protest against; whilst somebody else (a cousin hostess) points perfectly attired, seemed she afforded ample consolation lady's defects. "Upon beauty cousin, her father's wealth, her superabundant opportunities matrimony, Miss Lucy enlarged us, sat corner. Another her peculiarities, by-the-by, this. By her account, her relatives friends sense beautiful. The men generally 'splendidly handsome;' ladies, 'the loveliest creatures.' If 'lovely,' 'stylish;' nothing else, 'charming.' For beyond magic circle, process reversed. If pretty, 'wanted style.' If dress beyond criticism, nose, complexion, hand fault. I met _trait_ cliques, since then. "My dear Ida, I wish encourage young lady hoydenish age thirteen, despising nice dressing pretty looks manners; neglecting pick little hints she may glean things older friends. But people questions seem first importance, young impressionable, feel every defect personal appearance crime, believe neither worth, love, happiness (no life, fact, worth living for) connected much less ten thousand year, 'connections.' Through ordeal passed evening, seeing hearing expensive luxuries without seemed impossible feed, dress, sleep, go out--in fact, exist; equally expensive items adornment, without appeared impossible (or rate retain) respect affection friends. "Meanwhile, evening slipped by, Sunday reading accomplished. We found little good habits less easy maintain strange household thought, one seemed likely follow others allowed slip. The red-haired young lady absent half hour, Irishman prowling restlessly round room, performing murderous-looking fidgets paper-knives, she returned book her hand, she settled herself resolutely read. The Irishman gave comical glance serious-looking volume, then, seating chair behind her, found apparent peace effort sharpen flat ruler his knees. The young lady read on. It evident her Sunday customs apt disturbed circumstances. "I began feel uncomfortable. Fatima crouched near Lucy, listening history piece lace. I waited little time catch her eye, beckoned her me. "'We have not read,' I whispered. "'Dare go?' asked Fatima. "'We ought,' I said. "It required daring may appear. To little people _was_ rather undertaking cross big drawing-room, stealing together soft carpet; attack large, smooth handle, open heavy door, leave room face company. We it, however, confusion much increased Irish gentleman, jumped open door us. We utterly unable thank him, and, stumbling passage, flew room like caged birds set free. "Fatima drew pillows bed, made herself easy floor. I found book, climbed window-seat. The sun setting, light would last much longer; yet I turned pages slowly, find place, second part, thinking conversation downstairs. Fatima heaved deep sigh among her cushions, said: 'I wish rich.' "'I wish home,' I answered. "'When one's home,' Fatima continued, doleful tones, 'one does not feel it, one sees nobody; one goes among people, _is_ wretched plenty money things. And it is good saying is not,' she added, hurriedly, close subject. "'It is getting dark,' I said. "'I beg pardon: go on,' sighed Fatima. "I lifted voice, read till I could see longer. It Valley Humiliation Mr. Greatheart led Christiana her children. The 'green valley, beautified lilies,' whose meadows air pleasant; 'a man shall free noise hurryings life;' 'in former times men met angels.' "The last streaks crimson fading sky I read concluding lines shepherd-boy's song-- 'Fulness burden is, That go pilgrimage, Here little, hereafter bliss, Is best age age.' "'Here little, hereafter bliss!' "It always easy realize one believes. One needs sometimes get away world around, 'from noise hurryings life,' hear, read, see, something remind one standard drawing-rooms; petty troubles pilgrimage soul; great happy lives lived little; satisfying bliss here, hereafter. "We went downstairs slowly, hand hand. "'I wonder mother doing?' said Fatima. * * * * * "The next day Miss Lucy good-naturedly helped us move belongings smaller room occupy. It another part house, rather enjoyed running fro, especially Miss Lucy gracious communicative extreme. "'This oldest part house,' she said, sat bed resting labours, day sultry; 'and breaks odd way. There rooms beyond this. There matched side house, pulled down.' "'Why?' asked. "'Well, there is story it, family,' said Miss Lucy, mysteriously. 'But it is ghost story. I will tell you, like. But people afraid ghost stories. I am not; are, I will not tell it.' "Of course declared afraid. Sitting together, sunny summer's afternoon, perhaps not. "'It is years years ago,' began Miss Lucy; 'you know place belonged another branch family generations. Well, last came old Mr. Bartlett, one daughter, who, course, heiress. Well, she fell love man whose name I forget, he inferior family, queer character; her father would hear it, swore she married he would disinherit her. She would married man spite this, though; he wanted her money; so, he found old man quite resolute, chance his dying soon, he murdered him.' "We exclaimed; sudden catastrophe fairly took away breath. Miss Lucy's nerves sensitive, however, she rattled on. "'He smothered bed, and, he old man, might easily died night way, nothing could proved, he got off. Well, he married daughter, got property; first evening he took possession, he passing door old man's room, he heard somebody breathing heavily inside, he looked in, old father asleep his bed.' "'Not really?' said. "'Of course really,' said Miss Lucy, 'but said. That is ghost part it. Well, he would, he never could get rid old man, always asleep; he pulled rooms down, last he went abroad, he his wife died, property went cousin, took name Bartlett.' "'How awful!' murmured. But Miss Lucy laughed, told us family anecdotes, ghost story somewhat passed minds, especially little later heard wheels, and, peeping landing window, beheld post-chaise drive up. "'It is Cecilia!' screamed Miss Lucy, left us once. "I may well say here, dear Ida, Cecilia major proved altogether different expectations. Cecilia, travelling gear, taking old bonnet, begging cup tea, complaining soft accents butter halfpenny pound dearer Bath home, seemed connection Cecilia trimmings whose dresses bank-notes recklessly dissolved. The major, almost middle-aged man, roughish exterior, plain clothes, pulling his moustache letter arrived him, dispelled visions manly beauty military pomp even effectually. Later on, discovered Cecilia really pretty, soft, gentle, good deal lectured her mother, herself critical Miss Lucy's dress appearance young lady ours. The major proved kind sensible. He well-to-do 'expectations,' facts she would round glory invisible us. They seemed happy couple; like rest world led suppose. "The new-comers completely absorbed attention evening, till fairly entering older part house way bed, story old man's ghost recurred mind. It relief meet Bedford point, hear her cheerful good-night, see her turn room two doors ours. Once undressing I said: "'What horrid story Lucy told us.' "To sensible Fatima made answer: 'Do not talk it.' "We dismissed subject consent, got bed, I fell asleep. I quite know far night I roused Fatima's voice repeating name again, tones subdued terror. I know nothing irritatingly alarming, one young nervous, roused thus voice terror evident unknown. "'What is matter?' I asked. "'Do not hear?' gasped Fatima, whisper. "If she said robber bed, burglar window, ghost wardrobe, I prepared worst, would less alarming unknown evil. "'I hear nothing,' I said, pettishly. 'I wish you would go sleep, Fatima.' "'There!--now!' said Fatima. "I held breath, silence heard distinctly sound one snoring adjoining apartment. "'It is one snoring,' I said. "'Where?' asked Fatima, tragedy her voice unabated. "'In room behind us, course,' I said, impatiently. 'Cannot hear?' "Fatima's voice might voice shadow she answered: '_There room there._' "And cold chill crept also; I remembered wall behind snoring unmistakably proceeded outer wall. There room old Mr. Bartlett, his son-in-law murderer pulled down. There he heard 'breathing heavily,' seen asleep upon his bed, long he smothered his pillows, his body shut family vault. At least, said, particular moment felt comfort fact Miss Lucy said 'of course was not true.' I said something, Fatima made reply, I could feel her trembling, hear half-choked sob. I think fear her overpowered alarm, gave sort strength. "'Do not, dear,' I begged. 'Let us brave. It must something else. And there is nothing room. Let us go Bedford. She is next door one.' "Fatima could speak more. By moonlight blind, I jumped up, half dragged, half helped her bed across room. Opening door worst. To touch anything moment trial. We groped passage; I felt handle first door, turned second, went. The window-blind room drawn up, moonlight streamed everything. A nest white drapery covered one chair, muslin dress lay like sick ghost second, little black satin shoes web-like stockings floor, gold watch one two feminine ornaments lay table; bed reposed--not Bedford, friend Kate, fast asleep, one arm bed-clothes, her long red hair pigtail streaming pillow. I climbed treated her Fatima treated me, calling her low, frightened tones again. She woke last, sat up. "'You sprites! What matter?' she exclaimed. "I stumbled account misfortunes, middle young lady lay down, ended I believe she asleep again. Poor Fatima, saw nothing us return room terrors, began sob violently, roused friend more, she became full pity. "'You poor children!' she said, 'I am sleepy. I cannot get go ghost now; besides, one might meet somebody. But may get bed like; there is plenty room, nothing frighten you.' "In crept, willingly. She gave us long tail her hair, said, 'If want me, pull. But go sleep, can!'--and, she well finished sentence, her eyes closed more. In good company snoring ghost seemed thing hardly realized. We held long plait us, and, clinging drowning men rope, soon slept also. "When returned room next day, snoring heard, full sunshine summer morning fright seemed completely thing past, I persuaded suggest might 'fancy' (Kate already expressed her deliberate opinion effect), Fatima, whose convictions resolute type mine, replied, 'What is use trying believe what is true? I heard it; shall know I heard it, I live till I am hundred.' "In correct ghost stories, hero comes morning, valiant, exhausted terrors night, breakfast, his host invariably asks he slept. When came down, found Kate Irishman alone together breakfast-room. Now certainly keeping adventure he stepped forward, and, bowing profoundly, asked passed night; but, spite gravity his face, twinkle big brown eyes showed us made fun of; I felt slightly indignant friend, faithfully promised betray us Miss Lucy, might, I thought, saved us ridicule Irishman. The rest company began assemble, however, relief subject dropped. But though Irishman kept secret, every reason suspect he forget it; he looked terribly roguish breakfast, kept order Kate's severe glances. "'Always breathe nose,' he suddenly began. 'It moderates severity air, less trying lungs, prevents snoring.' "'Very true,' said major, sensible, liked instructive observations. "'It may laid axiom,' continued Irishman, gravely, 'that man snores sure disturb somebody; also man does not snore till he dies, likely live snoring ghost he dead.' "Kate looked daggers. The major laughed, said, 'Let give beef.' When he did not understand remark he always laughed, generally turned conversation eatables, he pretty safe; food common ground, slight laugh answers remarks, unless serious meeting visit condolence. A little later Irishman asked: 'What is origin expression stir long pole?' turned conversation wild beasts. But he presently inquired: 'What is meaning putting thing spout?' "'Pawning it,' said major, promptly. "'People pawn family jewels sometimes,' said Pat. 'Did ever hear anybody pawning family ghosts?' he asked, suddenly turning me. I gave distressed 'No,' he continued whisper, 'You never saw ghost spout?' "But, I could answer, he caught Kate's eye, and, making penitent face, became silent. "We drawing-room breakfast, Irishman passed window outside, whistling 'Kathleen Mavourneen.' We sitting Kate's feet, she got up, whispering, 'He is got something show you, he would not let tell,' went garden, following her. "There found Irishman, long pole, he waving triumphantly air. He bowed approached. "'This, young ladies,' he said, 'is original long pole spoken breakfast-table. With I stir bring forth inspection living identical ghost whose snoring disturbed repose last night.' "The little Irishman's jokes reassured me. I guessed he found clue mysterious noise; Fatima otherwise. She deeply frightened recover easily. She clung tremblingly me, I following him, whispered 'I would rather not.' "On her behalf I summoned courage remonstrate. "'If please, sir,' I said, 'Fatima would rather not; and, please, do not tease us more.' "The young lady added her entreaties, needed. The good-natured little gentleman sooner saw Fatima's real distress he lowered his pole, sank upon his knees grass, face genuine penitence. "'I _am_ sorry I have tormenting so!' he exclaimed. 'I forgot really frightened, see I knew was not ghost.' "'I heard it,' murmured Fatima resolutely, her eyes half shut. "'So I,' said Irishman, gaily; 'I have heard dozens times. It is owls.' "We exclaimed. "'Ah!' he said, comically, 'I see do not believe me! That is comes telling many small fibs. But it is true, I assure you. (And brown eyes look particularly truthful.) Barn-door owls make noise like snoring old man. And young ones live spout corner wall room. They are snoring scrambling spout night.' "It quite true, Ida, found, Fatima last persuaded visit corner rooms pulled down, where, decorated ivy, old spout formed home snoring owls. By aid long pole he brought young one view--a shy, soft, lovely, shadow-tinted creature, ghostly enough behold, felt like impalpable mass fluff, utterly refused kissed, went savagely blinking back his spout earliest possible opportunity. His snoring alarmed us more." "And noise really that?" said Ida. "It really was, dear." "It is splendid story," said Ida; "you see, I did not go sleep _this_ time. And became everybody, please? Did red-haired young lady marry Irishman?" "Very soon afterwards, dear," said Mrs. Overtheway. "We kept friendship, too, life; I many times amused children story Snoring Ghost." REKA DOM. "What home, where, loving?" FELICIA HEMANS. At last Ida allowed go out. She well wrapped up, escorted Nurse short walk good her health. It amusing, air fresh change pleasant, although street prove quite happy region looked nursery windows. Moreover, however strong one may fancy one become indoors, convalescent's first efforts doors apt feeble white moth crept shelter cocoon, giddy daylight, trembling open air. By-and-by feeling passed away, one afternoon Ida allowed go herself garden, "just run." The expression metaphorical, she far able run; she crept quietly walks, gathered polyanthuses, putting her face pleasure touch fresh flowers gives invalid. Then she saw hedge budding, gap she scrambled filled up. Ida thought expedition smiled. It certainly made her ill, but--it led Mrs. Overtheway. The little old lady come day, evening Ida sent her uncle. She downstairs evenings since her illness. These interviews reserved old gentleman always formal, uncomfortable affairs, Ida escaped sense relief, evening--being weak illness disappointed Mrs. Overtheway's absence--her nervousness almost amounted terror. Nurse her best way encouragement. It true Ida's uncle merry gentleman, nice dessert! What could well-behaved young lady desire wear her best frock, eat almonds raisins dining-room, she lady house? "Though I sorry child," Nurse confided butler she left Ida her uncle, "for his looks enough frighten grown person, let alone little girl. And go presently, like good soul, find excuse, let her see cheerful face." But kind-hearted old man-servant could find plausible pretext intruding dining-room, giving encouraging smile behind his master's chair, Ida nursery more. She honestly endeavoured good. She made her curtsey door without falter--weak she was. She taken her place head table dignity, accepted almonds raisins sufficiently audible thanks. She replied prettily enough her uncle's inquiries her health; and, anxious keep conversation, told hedge budding. "_What's_ matter hedge?" he asked rather sharply; Ida repeated her bit spring news, he seemed interested. It part gardener's work. Ida relapsed silence, her uncle. But all. He sharp eyes, fierce bushy eyebrows, he apt scrutinize Ida way seemed scatter her presence mind. This night nights she found his eyes upon her oftener usual. Whenever she looked he watching her, her discomfort increased accordingly. At last he broke silence abruptly saying: "You sorry, child, not, news came father's death?" The sudden introduction sacred subject made Ida's head reel. "What?" she cried, could get further. "Have forgotten already?" old gentleman said, almost reprovingly. "You know him, true; must remember hearing poor father drowned sea?" Ida's reply passionate outburst weeping her uncle rang bell helpless dismay, thankful old butler lifted child tenderly his arms carried her back Nurse. The old gentleman's feelings kindly his looks, he really much concerned puzzled effect his remarks. When butler returned report Ida going quietly bed, he sent her his "love" (the word seemed struggle difficulty behind his neck-cloth), remaining almonds raisins. "I cannot eat them," said Ida, smiling feebly, her head aching, "but kind him; please tell Brown tell I sorry, please put almonds raisins box. I make dolls feast them, ever I make dolls' feasts again." With weary little maid turned upon her pillow, last forgot her troubles sleep. The next morning Brown delivered similar message old gentleman. He gone away early train business, left Ida his love. "It is kind him," said Ida, again. But she went sadly paper she cutting shapes. She low spirits morning. Comfort hand, however. In course day came message Mrs. Overtheway, asking Nurse allow Ida go tea her evening. And Nurse consented. Ida could hardly believe her senses she found herself little old lady's fireside. How dainty her room was! How full bookshelves were! How many pictures hung upon walls! Above little table, innumerable pretty things, hung two pictures. One portrait man who, his apparent age, might old lady's son, he like her. He might good-looking, though, Ida thought, he kind, intelligent face, full energy understanding, better still. Close his portrait hung little sketch. It road running river. Opposite river house trees. It pretty sketch, Ida thought, road looked interesting, roads pictures--making one wish get frame walk see whither lead. Below sketch curious-looking characters written ink, Ida could make nothing. Tea soon ready. It spread little table itself. The white cloth seemed Ida whitest she ever seen, silver glass glittered, china covered rosebud pattern, reading-lamp threw clear soft light all. The tea, cream, brown bread butter, fresh eggs, honey--all best--even waiting-maid pretty, something old lady's smile. When she finished her duties taking away things, putting tea-table corner, two friends drew fire. "You look better tea, child," said little old lady. "Do eat enough home?" "As much I can," said Ida, "but I hungry somebody else tea me. There seldom anybody till came though. Only twice Lady Cheetham's housekeeper tea. She Nurse's father's first cousin, 'quite lady,' Nurse says. So she will not let her tea kitchen, she Nurse tea nursery, lots tea-cakes jam, Nurse keeps saying, 'Help yourself, Miss Ida! Make home, Mrs. Savory!' And, know, times, she is always telling night tea. So I generally eat good deal then, I often laugh, Nurse Mrs. Savory funny together. But Mrs. Savory's kind, last time she came she brought pincushion, time she gave Spa mug two apples." Mrs. Overtheway laughed, too, Ida's rambling account, two high good-humour. "What shall I amuse you?" asked little old lady. "You could not tell another story?" said Ida, accent meant, "I hope can!" "I would, gladly, dear, I do not know tell about;" she looked round room stories furniture perhaps were. Ida's eyes followed her, she remembered picture, said: "Oh! would please tell writing means pretty little sketch?" The little old lady smiled rather sadly, looked sketch silence moments. Then she said: "It Russian, dear. Their letters different ours. The words 'Reka Dom' mean 'River House.'" Ida gazed drawing increased interest. "Oh, remember anything it? If would tell _that_!" she cried. But Mrs. Overtheway silent again. She looking down, twisting rings upon her little hand, Ida felt ashamed asked. "I beg pardon," she said, imploringly. "I rude, dear Mrs. Overtheway; tell like, please." "You good child," said little old lady, "a good child, dear. I _do_ remember much house, I fall day-dreams I look it. It brings back memories great deal pleasure great deal pain. But one advantage old, little Ida, Time softens painful remembrances, leaves us happy ones, grow clearer every day." "Is yourself?" Ida asked, timidly. She quite understood little old lady's speech; indeed, she understand many things Mrs. Overtheway said, satisfactory companions that. "Yes, myself. And since dear child cares old Mrs. Overtheway, her prosy stories, befell her long ago," said little old lady, smiling affectionately Ida, "I tell her story--my story--the story Reka Dom." "Oh, good you!" cried Ida. "There much merit it," said little old lady. "The story much you. I tell bits every evening tea, I used do. I look far back, I endeavour look far forward. I try picture greater happiness, companionship perfect I known; I shall able realize them, I shall found better Home Reka Dom." Ida crept little old lady's feet, softly stroked slipper rested fender. Then, March wind howled beyond curtains, she made herself cosy corner fire, composed herself hear story. "I remember," said Mrs. Overtheway. "I remember Reka Dom. It new home. "Circumstances made necessary change residence, new home certain quiet little town, much bigger big villages--a town pebble streets small shops, silent, sunny, rather dull--on banks river.

"'Reka Dom?' said father thoughtfully (and he pronounced _Rayka Dome_). 'It Russian. It means River House. Very curious! I suppose people live Russians.

If houses looked proved direct reverse I (on behalf brothers sisters) search of, Reka Dom remarkable degree answered requirements. To explore garden like tour fairy land. It oddly laid out. Three grass-plots lawns, one behind another, divided hedges honeysuckle sweet-briar.

The second lawn greater things store me. There, two tall elm trees hung swing. With cry delight I seated myself, seized ropes, gave vigorous push. But impetus strong, ropes rotten, I swing came ground together. This deter me, however, exploring third lawn, I made discovery swing nothing. "It merely small path shrubbery led little enclosed piece ground devoted many-shaped, box-edged little flower-beds characteristic 'children's gardens,'--it alone beds shaped like letters, indisputably M among them--but six number.

It really seemed kind old fairy conjured whole place benefit. And--bless good godmother!--to crown all, two old tea-chests bottomless barrel yard. "Doubtless many causes influenced father _his_ leaning towards Reka Dom, he confide me. But I truly believe first foremost attractions name.

And perhaps next mystic attraction words whose meaning yet hidden, discover traces foreign language unexpected unlikely place.

Besides this, though he could allow reason mother's views subject large grounds combination one man-of-all-work, he liked plenty space shrubbery he could wander about--his hands behind his back--without disturbed; his part he undoubtedly felt pleasure possession large grounds annoyance seeing neglected. So garden tempted him. Finally, room opening upon laurel walk, one time library.

Then whole class partisan games gave us wonderful entertainment. Sometimes pretended Scottish chieftains, feudal barons England, chiefs savage tribes. Our gardens always lands inherited conquered, called names little Russians. When Highland chiefs, I remember, put Mac indiscriminately names; cases comical, others satisfactory effect. As chief MacIvans I felt justly proud title, brother represented MacElizabeths less fortunate. In sham battles pet animals (we one) duty retainers, much bewilderment.

I made large copy fasten upon nursery wall; I wrote books; Fatima, could induced attack fat grammar me, became equally absorbed her part effort reduce inscription cross-stitch benefit her sampler. "I borrowed fat grammar again, and, spite father's warnings difficult yet, I hoped soon proficient language little Russians.

"When sham battles ended real quarrels, following footsteps little Russians becoming irksome--(especially Fatima, whose predecessor--Peter--had military turn, begun fortifications near kitchen garden she incompetent carry out) new idea struck me. I announced letters properly written addressed little Russians, 'Reka Dom, Russia,' posted old rhubarb-pot tool-house, would duly answered. The replies found week's time office.

As usual, I refused give explanations, inventing several answered awhile, adopted general consent idea put forth little Phillis.

Yes, changed home again. The River House longer. Childhood also slipped grasp, slowly years seemed pass, sufficed accomplish every project made them. Not one long summers river seen gorgeous display flowers garden good faith energy planned every spring. I learnt Russian. Years gone since I first took fat grammar, I acquired little since time beyond familiar characters well-beloved name, Reka Dom. "The country town circumstances made home possessed least one attraction us. It old friends Misses Brooke settled brother's death broke quiet little household. I fond good ladies; less I child, home-made buns faded albums made evening festive, looked forward treat. They good women, severe charitable others, cultivated grace humility almost excess. One little weakness, however, otherwise estimable characters times disturbed even course friendship. I hardly know call it. It want candour. More truthful women exist were, I believe never wilfully deceived anyone. I describe habit indulging small plots suspicions; want trust people, partly traceable, perhaps, lack due confidence themselves, provoking one young, eager, sincerely affectionate I was. I indignant discover little plots laid test sincerity; find genuine (if minutely measured) expressions feeling doubted. If peculiarity troublesome early stages acquaintance, doubly met again, lapse years. For one thing, dear ladies older, fidgety, foolish little weaknesses kind sometimes increase years. Then I older also, doubted powers entertainment I child, would still less believe I could enjoy society I 'young lady.' Whereas truth was, though taste buns reverence smooth pencil drawings impossible perspective certainly diminished, real enjoyment quiet evening old friends greater before. I liked take sewing undisturbed fireside, pieces work flagged constant interruptions home rapidly finished I chatted them. I liked draw acquirements would believe possessed. I enjoyed rubbing modern desultory reading old-fashioned solid knowledge. I admired high delicate principles, respected almost fatiguing modesty. At age religious questions move often seriously trouble girls' minds, I drew comfort piety, (although quiet modest virtues) years, eyes, ruling principle did, subject courage speak decision, crown affections pleasures, sufficient consolation sorrow. In addition this, I went them, I knew visit gave pleasure. "It seemed hard could always repose similar confidence me. And yet was. The consistent affection years failed convince 'a young, pretty, lively girl' (as pleased call me) could find pleasure society 'two dull old women.' So apt suspect either second motive visit, affectation appearance enjoyment. At times I chafed almost beyond powers endurance fancies; one occasion vexation broke bounds respect. "'You think uncandid, madam,' I cried; 'and you? If hear I spoken you, elsewhere, two dull old women, would much astonished angered. You know would. You know do not think I think so. I cannot imagine say it!' "And feelings much way logic women, I got further, broke tears. "'She says we are uncandid, Mary' sobbed Miss Martha. "'So are, I believe,' said Miss Mary, cried together. "I think protracted worry misunderstanding (which long one) made almost hysterical. I clearly remember feeling lying face horsehair sofa little dining-room, feebly repeating, 'You should not, know. You should not!' amid tears, hair softly stroked two sisters, comforted me, blamed depth self-abasement almost made laugh. It hardly seemed possible customary humility could go lower. The affair wound good deal kissing, tea, suspicions long time. * * * * * "There peace, I said, long. But as, best times, Misses Brooke never gave us invitation without going form apologizing probable dulness entertainment, I surprised one morning find invited tea Belle Vue Cottage following evening, strict condition I refuse invitation I felt disinclined go. I met good ladies came church. There Morning Prayer Wednesdays Fridays one church town, two little straw bonnets Misses Brooke seen bending side side every service, rest scanty congregation would much astonished every one town time opportunity public worship availed privilege. On day usual, turned street together, invitation given. "'And could induce respected father come you, Mary dear?' added Miss Mary. 'You know rooms small, glad see Fatima. But friends coming, she understand.' "'Only few,' Miss Martha said, hastily. 'Do not make her think there is anything worth coming for, Mary. And mind, Mary dear, do not care come, say so. There is need "excuses" us. And know exactly tea-parties are.' "'Now, Miss Martha,' I said, shaking fist her, 'I will not bear it!' "'Well, dear, know it is true.

"Now rather unfair, I taken banter occasions serious treatment subject failed. I made peace, however, grave affectionate assurances I wished come, would like come; adding solemn promise I felt averse time came, I would stay home. "I vexed find symptoms old misunderstanding arising. The good ladies evidently fidgety humour to-day, going home full it, I poured vexation Fatima. "Fatima's composure easily ruffled mine. She apt sit easy, graceful attitudes, looking idle, getting wonderful amount exquisite needlework, listening passing grievances without much disturbed herself. "'I do not think I would worry myself,' she said, she rapidly sorted greens leaf her embroidery. 'My idea is, find party lively usual. I often noticed old ladies particularly full apologies, something somebody expected.' "'I did not want anything anybody,' I said, dolefully; 'but I wish would not take fancies, I wish would not put one cross-examinations nothing. As party, could be, old set?' "'Nobody, I suppose. There will Wilkinsons, course;' Fatima marked fact emphatic stitch. 'And Mr. Ward, I suppose, Dr. Brown, Jones's girls, and--' "'Oh, rooms would not hold more!' I said. "'There is always room one more--for gentleman rate; and, depend upon it, I say.' "Fatima fond Misses Brooke I was. She scruple complain trouble cost maintain intimate relations excellent touchy old ladies, hot water trifles one must perpetually fall. "'I hope I pretty trustworthy,' she would say, 'and I sure are, Mary. And not, let drop acquaintance. But treat friends used treat flowers Reka Dom! They always taking see going on, I like vegetate peace.' "I could criticized dear respected old friends freely; yet I knew Fatima spoke truth. "The subject unexpectedly renewed dinner. "'Mary,' said father, 'is mystery connected tea-party Miss Brooke's?' "Fatima gave mischievous glance. "'If is, sir,' said I, 'I secret.' "'I met town,' he went on, 'and good enough invite me; I must see Ward registers, I ventured ask he party (thinking save old legs walk his place). The matter simple enough, Miss Martha seemed fancy I wanted know going there. I fully explained real object, either she hear she believe me, I suppose, she gave list expected company.' "'I sure she would believed you, sir, she realized saying,' I said. 'I know sort thing, I think generally absorbed efforts think want, spare attention say.' "'A ingenious bit special pleading, dear, heard all. I made best bow turning away, Miss Martha, begging excuse her, asked good deal mystery agitation _you_ commissioned find party. I said I seen since breakfast, I quite able assure her wished find anything subject, would gone direct herself, I repeated best bow best style, escaped.' "I much hurt speak, Fatima took conversation father. "'You go, sir?' she said. "'Of course, dear, Mary wishes it. Besides, Ward _is_ there. I learnt much.' "'You learnt more, sir,' said Fatima, 'and please do not leave us die curiosity. Who there, all?' "'The Wilkinsons, Miss Jones her sister, Ward, old friend Miss Brooke's, merchant.' "'But his name, please!' cried Fatima, father retreating his study. "'Smith--John Smith,' he answered laughing, left alone. "I much disposed injured gloomy, Fatima would allow it. She successful comforter. In first place, she thoroughly sympathetic; second, she great dislike disturbance general peace harmony, last, her easy, cheerful view things became infectious serious troubles concerned. "'People must little weaknesses,' she said, 'and I sure have not many failings.' "'This weakness unworthy them,' I complained. " good people's weaknesses unworthy them, dear. And better are, unworthy weakness appears. Now, Mary, reasonable! You know bottom true are, fond you. Pray allow fidgety fancies, poor old dears. No doubt shall fidgety old. I am sure I shall many fancies hairs wig, you, considering little things weigh mind now--' "Fatima's reasoning conclusive, I think I came last believe Miss Brooke's distrust creditable herself, complimentary me--so certainly must convincing. "'And now,' she concluded, 'come upstairs forget it. For I got two new ideas I want opinion. The first new stitch, I purpose work muslin dresses us both. I thought bed morning. The second new plan braiding hair, came head whilst father reading aloud speech us last night. I fastened last plait he laid paper.' "'You absurd Fatima!' I cried. 'How could you! And interesting!' "'Do not look shocked,' said Fatima. 'I shall never politician. Of studies, politics seems disturbing uncomfortable.

As is, I do not worry it; last night looking flushed excited end speech, I calmly happy--' "'But, Fatima,' I broke in, 'you do not mean say--' "'If lasted five minutes longer,' said Fatima, 'I comfortably decided whether ferns ivy would combine better loops.' "'But, Fatima! really listening when--' "'On whole I decide ivy,' said Fatima, danced room, I following attempting one remonstrance hall. "'But, Fatima!--' "'With perhaps suspicion white chrysanthemums,' she added banisters. "Both new ideas promised successful, following evening hair dressed Fatima called political plaits. From first evening introduction society she established herself lady's maid. She took generous delight dressing up, clever she kind it. This evening she seemed surpassed herself, I judged admiring exclamations younger sister Phillis--a good little maid, stood behind chair combs pins her hand Fatima's aide-de-camp. Finally, dexterous fingers interwove sprays ivy hair, added white rosebuds lack chrysanthemums. "'Perfect!' Fatima exclaimed, stepping backwards gestures admiration provokingly visible glass I sat. 'And think wasted uninteresting tea-party! You wear new muslin, course?' "'Indeed, I shall,' I answered. 'You know I always make smart Cottage.' Which true, reason this. I gone quiet tea-party dress rather smart occasion, looked doubly gay contrast sombre costume elderly friends I met. I feeling vexed error taste, Miss Mary came me, laying her hands affectionately me, smoothing ribbons, thanked come pretty costume. "'You come in, dear,' she said, 'like fresh nosegay winter. You see old women, love, dress mostly black, since dear James's death; friends chiefly elderly sombre-looking also. So great treat us look something young pretty, remember girls, took pains things ourselves.' "'I afraid I smart, Miss Mary,' I said. "'To sure waste wear pretty things here,' Miss Mary added; 'but might let us know sometimes going grand party, come look you.' "I touched humble little lady's speech, thought little one apt realize fact faded, fretful, trouble-worn people middle life young, remember youth. "Thenceforward I made careful toilettes Cottage, night exception rule. "I dressed early; father rather late, three girls nearly hour's chat I go. "We began discuss merchant vary monotony small social circle. Phillis heard strange gentleman arrived town afternoon London stage. Fatima idea subject she boldly stated. One Misses Brooke going married--to London merchant. We age real life romance attractive, town rich romances--at least, little society. So Fatima's idea found great favour us, and, she described it, seemed really probable. Here old friend, friend youth, probably lover, turned again, sisters natural state agitation. (It fully accounted Miss Martha's suspicious sensitiveness yesterday, I felt ashamed aggrieved.) Doubtless lovers allowed marry early life he poor. They parted, remained faithful. He made fortune, like Dick Whittington, now, rich London merchant, come back take his old love home. Being old friend, obviously youthful attachment; merchant, he must rich. This happy combination--universal fiction, though invariable real life--was could desired, received strong confirmation fact his coming London; days country girls seldom visited metropolis, regarded great city awe, centre wealthy wonderful. It charming story, though could wish he returned Miss Martha took 'front' spectacles, yet pictured comfortable domestic future them; Fatima positive 'worlds' might done appearance future Mrs. Smith tasteful costume, longed ardently assume direction her toilette. "'I do not believe she need wear front,' she pleaded. 'I daresay she plenty pretty grey hair underneath. Spectacles intellectual, properly worn; which, by, need meals husband looking across table; caps--' "But father knocked door, I put cloak hood, went him. "The Misses Brooke received us affectionately, I thought excitement, flush Miss Martha's cheeks almost made smile. I could keep Fatima's fancy head. Indeed, I picturing old friend cheerful matronly costume presiding elegant belongings stout, well-to-do, comfortable Mr. John Smith, I moved little room, exchanged mechanical smiles greetings familiar guests. I settled sober couple fireside, hesitating dove-colour lavender-grey wedding silk, Miss Martha herself disturbed I decided important question. I fancied slight tremor her voice she said-- "'Mr. John Smith.' "I dropped formal curtsey I hitherto done, due stranger gentleman, looked object benevolent fancies, mittens. His head coming low bow, instantaneous impression was, 'He wears brown wig.' But moment he upright, I saw he not. And--he certainly suitable point age. I took one glance make sure, meeting his eyes, turned hastily, plunged conversation nearest neighbour, noticing instant was. As I recovered momentary confusion, I became aware I talking rector's wife, advanced opinions subject weather she energetically disputing. I yielded gracefully, went back thoughts. I hope Miss Martha feel I loss suitable, comfortable, middle-aged partner fancy provided her. It seem pity he existence. I thought probably marriage happiest condition people, felt inclined discuss question rector's wife, twenty-two years' exemplary experience state. Then I like helped choose silk-- "At point I asked play. "I played favourite things Miss Brooke's own, Mr. Smith turning leaves music; he asked sing, astonishment, prepared accompany himself. Few English gentlemen (if any) could accompany songs pianoforte youth, Ida; wise idea pianoforte instrument 'only fit women,' would soon thought trying learn play upon studying spinning-wheel. I know I ever heard one play except father, lived much abroad. When Mr. Smith sat instrument, I withdrew corner, Miss Martha followed talk. But he began, I think every one silent. "The song he sang old one now, Ida, comparatively new then, happened us heard before. It 'Home, Sweet Home.' He charming voice, sweet pathetic ring it, his singing would redeemed song far smaller merit, sentiment less common his hearers. As was, sympathies taken storm. The rector's wife sobbed audibly, but, I believe, happily, oblique reference ten children she left home; poor Miss Martha, behind me, touched away tear tear her thin finger-tips, finally took her pocket-handkerchief, thoughts dear dead brother, little house garden, I know earlier home still. As me, I thought Reka Dom. "We many homes, _the_ home _par excellence_--the beloved father, beloved us all. And clear voice sang refrain, sounded ears like tender cry recall past happiness, 'Home--Home--sweet, sweet Home!' I stroked Miss Martha's knee silent sympathy, saw Reka Dom eyes. The river seemed flow melody. I swung tune elm-trees, Walton Cotton lap. What would Piscator thought it, milkmaid sung song? I roamed three lawns better pleasures palaces, stood among box-edged gardens. Then refrain called back again-- 'Home--Home--sweet, sweet Home!' I almost glad ended I, too, quite broke down. "Everybody crowded round singer admiration song, inquiries it. "'I heard concert town day,' he said, 'and struck pretty, I got copy. It English opera called "Clari," seems pretty thing it.' "'Do like it?' Miss Jones asked me; I suppose I spoken. "'I think lovely,' I said, 'as far I judge; carries one away criticism; I think I thinking music; I thinking Home.' "'Exactly.' "It Miss Jones said 'Exactly,' merchant, standing her; he said it, indefinite tone polite assent people commonly smile answers other's remarks evening parties, he understood words thought thought. We three fell conversation song--about 'Clari'--about opera--the theatre--about London; Dr. Brown, educated great city, joined us, finally he Miss Jones took London subject themselves, merchant continued talk me. He pleasant company, chiefly alive intelligence much less trouble talk one I ever met, except father. He required much less average amount explanation. It hardly seemed possible use words seize meaning ends, speak; root idea sprang from, conclusion tended. "We talked music--of singing--of new song, subject it--home. And home-love, patriotism, characters nations feeling seemed predominate. "'Like everything else, depends partly circumstances, I suppose,' he said. 'I sometimes envy people one home--the eldest son landed proprietor, instance. I fancy I much home-love people, divided; I homes one.' "'_I_ homes one,' I said; 'but I think divided. At least, one homes much dearer others.' "'Do think latest, feelings freshest?' he asked. "I laughed. 'A bad guess. It present home. This one near river.' "'Exactly.' "This time 'exactly' seem appropriate before, I explained further. "'For one thing I age attachment place gets deeply rooted, I think. As mere child one enjoys suffers like kitten hour hour. But one old enough form associations weave dreams, yet still child--it then, I fancy, home gets almost bound one's life.' "He simply said 'Yes,' I went on. Why, I hardly tell, except talk subject beyond mere current chit-chit, understood, luxury often taste tea-parties town. "'And yet I do not know theory hold good, even case,' I went on, 'for father quite much devoted place were, fell love quite early. But foreign name first attraction him, I think.' "'It abroad, then?' he asked. "I explained, I hardly tell why, I went talking till I given nearly full history Reka Dom I given you. For one thing he seemed amazingly interested recital, drew many particulars questions; song filled head tender memories, happy little details old times, always pleasant prose River Home, indeed, child, pleasant still. "We laughing childish reminiscence, Miss Martha tapped shoulder said rather louder usual-- "'Dear Mary, engravings here, love, I like look at.' "I felt rather astonished, I knew every book picture house well I knew own, I followed her table, she added, fluttering whisper-- "'You will excuse interrupting you, love, I am sure; becoming quite particular.' "I blushed redder crimson silk binding 'Keepsake' me. I wished I could honestly misunderstood Miss Martha's meaning. But I could not. Had I indeed talked much long gentleman stranger? (It startled reflect rapidly passed stage civil commonplace normal condition intercourse gentlemen town.) I certainly innocent intentional transgression bounds reticence decorum young lady's best friends, length conversation merchant I felt quite uncertain unspeakably alarmed. "I indulging hasty dismal reflections Miss Martha continued-- "'When I young, dear Mary, I remember valuable piece advice given excellent friend schoolmistress, Miss Peckham, "If slightly acquainted gentleman, talk indifferent matters. If wish friendly conspicuous, talk _his_ affairs; mean intimate, speak yourself;"' adding, 'I am sure you will forgive me, love,' Miss Martha fluttered table. "At moment I feeling provoked her myself, feel sure forgiveness she professed be; one thing I felt perfectly certain. Nothing sheer necessity induce speak another syllable London merchant. "Circumstances altogether favour resolution. I scrupulously avoided much look Mr. Smith, though mysterious way I became conscious he father long _tête-à-tête_ conversation corner. I devoted exclusively rector's wife till supper, I carefully chose opposite side table merchant seemed going. But I fairly seated, reason he gave his place someone else, impossible change seat, he took one next it. It provoking, I steadily resisted his attempts talk, kept face much averted possible. Once twice he helped something table, I barely thanked him, never lifted eyes his face. I could not, however, avoid seeing hand helped me, idly noticing ring I remarked before, he playing. It fine blue stone, lapis lazuli, curiously artistically set. 'Rich merchants afford baubles!' I thought. It tasteful, however, look like English work. There something engraven upon it, look like English either. Was Greek? I glanced curiosity, reminded of--but nonsense, fancy came subject mind. At moment hand ring moved close I looked again. "It fancy. There mistaking inscription time. I learnt thoroughly--written often--loved well--it _Reka Dom_. "For moment I sat blind astonishment. Then truth suddenly flashed upon me. The merchant's name name predecessors Reka Dom. True, common one I met one family Smiths since without dreaming connection River House. And yet, course, Misses Brooke known him. Before time. Which could he be? He young father, John among little Russians--unless, yes, English version one Russian names--and Ivan. "It crowned misfortunes. What would Miss Martha say she knew subject conversation? Would excellent rule guide her young ladyhood curtailed conversational propensities mine! I thought three degrees intimacy shudder. Why satisfied discussing merits song? "We gone talk his homes, enough, proceeded mine. I got red I sat listening civil chat Mr. Ward curate (eminently innocent stage first degree), trying recall spoken connection Home beloved us, Ivan whose lilies I tended years. "I grew nearly frantic I thought he must think I known he was, wildly indignant fancy small mysteries kept Miss Brooke telling us going meet. "At last evening came end. I cloaking hall merchant came offered his help, I declined. But he go, stood I could help seeing distressed look his eyes, nervous way he turning blue ring upon his finger. "'I wanted speak again,' he said. 'I wanted say--' "But moment I caught Miss Martha's eye parlour doorway, and, dropping hasty curtsey, I ran father. "'A nice young fellow,' father observed, I took his arm outside; 'a superior, sensible, well informed gentleman, do not meet every day.' "I felt quite unequal answering remark, he went on: "'What funny little ways old friends have, dear, sure. Considering strangers come place, would natural tell us one asked us meet; known us, tenants Reka Dom, doubly natural speak us, us him. But he told people present he heard word. He seems fond appreciate little oddities. He told he remembers, boy, never would call Ivan, much his name man ever baptized. They thought might give tendency affectation bear singular name England. They always called John, keep discipline still. When he arrived yesterday expressed highly satisfied general improvement him, he said he could hardly help laughing Miss Martha added, 'And seem quite shaken little habit affectation which--you will excuse me, dear John--you boy.' He says that, best his belief, his approach affectation consisted his rather absent ungainly, strong aversion Mr. Brooke.' "'Did old gentleman wear frightful shade his time?' I asked. "'Not always,' he says, 'but he looked worse without it. He told good deal I never heard. He remembered hearing spoken boy. It appears brother wild extravagant his youth; drank, too, I fancy, gave his poor sisters world trouble, breaking heart widowed mother spoiled him. When she died sisters lived together, never faltered efforts save him--never shut doors he would return--and paid his debts again. He spent his fortune, theirs, besides means breaking comfortable marriages both. Mr. Smith thinks long illness checked his career, eventually he reformed.' "'I hope he grateful his poor sisters,' I said. "'One naturally thinks he must so, Smith's remark just. He said, "I fancy he penitent grateful far he able, I believe he long accustomed unqualified self-sacrifice feel sensitively!" And I believe he right. Such men seldom reform conduct live long enough, eyes blinded years selfishness opened see clearly world.' "'It ought make one tender good ladies' little weaknesses,' I said, self-reproachfully; I walked home peaceful state mind. I forgave poor Miss Martha; also I secretly satisfied father found merchant's conversation attractive. It seemed give excuse breach Miss Peckham's golden rule. Moreover, little troubles offences seemed mountains Bellevue Cottage apt dwindle surmountable molehills larger-minded parents. I comparatively ease again. My father evidently seen nothing unusual conduct, I hoped conspicuous. Possibly I might never meet Mr. Smith more. I rather hoped not. Life long, world wide, sometimes possible lose sight people one disagreeable associations. And wholesome lesson future. "'And old gentleman like?' Fatima's first question, I came upstairs. I talking Mr. Brooke, old gentleman occurred memory moment. "'What old gentleman?' I asked dreamily. "'Miss Martha's old gentleman, merchant--was not he there, all?' "I blushed stupidity, certain feeling guiltiness connection person alluded to. "'Oh, yes, he there,' I answered; 'but he old gentleman.' "'What he, then?' Fatima asked, curiously. "It undoubtedly luxury bearer piece startling intelligence, well spoil enjoyment haste. I finished unsnapping necklace, said, deliberately-- "'He one little Russians.' "Fatima's wit jumped quickly mine done. It she added-- "'Then he Ivan.' * * * * * "My hopes reference Mr. Smith disappointed. I seen last him. My mother time home, I housekeeper her absence. It morning following Bellevue tea-party father said me-- "'Mr. Smith coming refer book mine to-day, dear; I asked stay dinner. I suppose convenient?' "I said, 'Certainly, sir.' "I could plead domestic inconvenience; I thought Mr. Smith might gone quietly back London early coach, spared agitation prospect seeing undoubtedly excited. He came, however. It first visit, means last; he lingered town, greatly father's satisfaction (who taken strong fancy him), not, apparently, Misses Brooke. "As I afterwards found clue somewhat strange conduct old friends time, I may well briefly state was. "When merchant first announced his proposed business visit town, his intention calling them, good ladies (in affection me, high opinion him) planned kindly little romance he I hero heroine, end happy marriage. With view arranged meeting tea-party, avoided mention other, might meet (so speak) incidental way characteristic real love stories. With suspiciousness people general, young people particular, haunted Miss Martha, she attributed ready acceptance invitation heard Mr. Smith's arrival, unusual attraction eligible gentleman tea-party. Little she guess benevolent plans part I formed her, merchant's youthful appearance dashed ground. "It sometimes case, dear Ida, people make kind plans friends, become dissatisfied success arrangements cease good genii plot. If, is, matters seem likely fall wish, without assistance. It Misses Brooke, especially Miss Martha. Fully aware end she her mind proposed acquaintance, long conversation merchant struck her indelicate readiness accept attentions matrimony her perspective, she designed gradual result sundry well-chaperoned studiously incidental interviews Cottage. And when, far thankfully accepting incidental meetings, merchant took upon become almost daily visitor house, delayed his return London far beyond time proposed his departure, good lady's view underwent decided change. It 'a pity' young man like John Smith neglect his business. It also 'a pity' dear Mary's mother home. And I took occasion casually allude fact Mr. Smith's visits paid father, (with exception occasional meal) passed study amongst German pamphlets, statement met kind, incredulous smiles, supplemented general somewhat irritating observations proper line conduct young ladies certain crises life. Nothing could kinder Miss Martha's intentions, her advice might still greater kindness she would spoken straight-forwardly, believed I said. As was, I left going Bellevue Cottage, ardently wished merchant would go back his merchandise, leave quiet little town dull peace. "Sometimes I thought full-grown man whose intelligent face, faintly foreign accent whose voice familiar home--the busy merchant, polite agreeable gentleman. And I thought Ivan I seemed known much better long ago! The pale boy wandering water--reading swing--dead river--buried beneath lilies. Oh! he lived come back new form trouble me? "One day he came father usual, I took opportunity call old friends. I felt ashamed neglected them, I knew Mr. Smith house, I could suspected hoped meet theirs. But I called unfortunate moment.

All past. We used hope neither us long outlive other, God willed otherwise. It bitter first, different now. The days hours seemed widen separation fast bringing us together again." "Was he papa's age he died?" Ida gently asked. "He older father been, love, I think. He middle-aged man. He died fever.

"I like know became old landlord, please," Ida said. "If ask old woman like history people she knew her youth," said Mrs. Overtheway, smiling, "you must expect hear deaths. Of course he dead many long year since. We became intimate whilst his tenants, and, I believe, cheered close his life. He father fast friends, mother he became especially devoted.

But late life nephew became rich, habits parsimony second nature, seemed grown chronic exaggerated novel anxieties wealth. He still 'starved--and bought books.'

"She was, dear. But, sadly enough, last. We seaside he seized his last illness, one told us, indeed probable people knew. At last letter servant announced he dying, anxious see mother, she hastened home. The servant seemed relieved her arrival, old gentleman altogether easy patient nurse.

"Dead--dead--dead!" said little old lady; "Ida, child, I answer questions." "One more, please," said Ida! "where dear, dear Fatima?" "No, child, no! Nothing her. Dear, dear Fatima, indeed! And yet I tell she married, her husband (older even I am, deaf) living still. He I fond other, though, handsome man he sensitive his personal appearance, use trumpet, I consider weak. But get well.

When child seen her old friend house she still kept her place, postman coming street, amusing watch door door, see large bundle letters he delivered each. At Mrs. Overtheway's he delivered one, big one, odd curiosity letter took possession Ida. She wished she knew about, came, though, face it, likely she would much wiser she did. She still window door opposite house opened, little old lady came hurriedly out. She her cap upon her head, she held open letter her hand; _the_ letter, evident. When she reached little green gate she seemed recollect herself, and, putting her hand her head, went back house. Ida waited anxiously see she would come again, presently she appeared, time her bonnet, still letter her hand. She crossed street, seemed coming house. Then bell rang, she came. Ida's curiosity became intense, lessened fact little old lady come her, stayed talking one. The old gentleman returned, must Nurse. At last conversation came end, Mrs. Overtheway came upstairs. She kissed Ida tenderly, inquired her health; though she seemed affectionate usual, Ida felt persuaded something matter. She drew chair fire, old lady sat down, saying-- "May I stay little you, dear?" "Oh, thank you?" said Ida, put footstool old lady's feet. Mrs. Overtheway stroked her head tenderly time silence, said, gentle voice-- "I something tell you, dear." "Another story?" Ida asked. "Oh, thank you, another story." The old lady silent, last she said, herself-- "Perhaps best so," added: "yes, love, I tell story." Ida thanked her warmly, another pause ensued. "I hardly know begin, tell story," said little old lady last, seeming falter first time her Scharazad-like powers narration. "Let Home, please; can," said Ida. "A home!" said old lady, strangely enough, she seemed agitated she spoken Reka Dom--"It begun broken home, shall not. It end united home, God willing. A home! I must begin far-away one, strange one, summit high cliffs, home fearless, powerful creatures, white-winged like angels." "It is fairy tale," said Ida. "No, child, true." "It sounds like fairy tale," Ida said. "It shall tale description, like," said old lady, pause, "but, I said, main incidents true." "And white-winged creatures?" Ida asked. "Were fairies?" "No, love; birds. But see snowy albatrosses huge white wings wheeling circles vessel sailing mid ocean anything like I read heard described, fairyland could hardly show anything beautiful impressive." "Do fly near ships, then?" Ida asked. "Yes, child. I remember husband describing he seen southern seas. He said he saw them, great, white, majestic, holding intercourse anyone board ship, yet spreading wings her day night hundreds miles ocean, folded feet, huge white pinions, except occasional flap, outstretched steady sail, never resting, seemingly never weary, looked like guardian angels keeping watch crew." "I wonder sorry ships go down?" said Ida, thoughtfully. Mrs. Overtheway took her hand. "Do think unkind talk ships, love?" she asked. "No, no, no!" Ida exclaimed, "I do not mind _your_ talking it. I wish I could talk birds saw papa's ship go down, any, ask was, he minded much, he remembered me. I used wish I him, one night I dreamed it; water touched me, I frightened, screamed, woke; I glad I had not there, perhaps he would not loved much he seen I was not brave." The little old lady kissed her tenderly. "And story, please," said Ida, pause. And Mrs. Overtheway began following story: KERGUELEN'S LAND. "'Down deep, freight crew, Past help she lies, And never bale come shore Of thy merchandise. 'For cloth gold comely frieze,' Winstanley said, sigh'd, 'For velvet coif, costly coat, They fathoms deep may bide. 'O thou, brave skipper, blithe kind, O mariners bold true, Sorry heart, right sorry I, A-thinking you.'" "WINSTANLEY" (JEAN INGELOW). "Father Albatross day, come home island gives name story. He taken short flight, his wife hatching egg, he kept comparatively near island her nest situated. There one egg, parental affection influenced numbers. There always love enough largest family, everything could desired child, Mother Albatross proud she hen sitting dozen. "The Father Albatross considerate. Not he deny long flights he his mate greatly enjoyed, he generally contrived bring back his shorter trips bits news her amusement. Their island home lay far common track ships, sometimes he sighted distant vessel, he generally found something tell birds fish, whales waterspouts, icebergs storms. When news he discussed winds waves, talk weather crops. "Bits news, like misfortunes, apt come together. The day egg hatched, Father Albatross returned his morning flight full he seen, he hardly paid attention his mate's announcement addition his family. "'Could leave nest quarter hour, dear?' he asked. "'Certainly not,' said Mother Albatross; 'as I told you, egg hatched last.' "'These things always happen least convenient moments,' said father bird. 'There is ship within mere wing-stretch, untold miles her course, going down. I came away she sinking, might chance seeing her. It horrible sight.' "'It must terrible witness', she replied, 'and I would give worlds see it; mother's first duty nest, quite impossible move. At time I beg return, see whatever seen.' "'It worth while,' he answered; 'there moment lose, time she must bottom belonging her.' "'Could none fly away?' Mother Albatross asked. "'No men wings,' replied her mate, 'nor, matter, fins scales either. They curious creatures. The fancy wandering sea sky, Nature enabled support either, truly wonderful. Go ocean meet men, meet fish birds. Then anything disables ships contrive go in, go, men neither float fly, sink bottom like many stones.' "'Were many ship saw?' mother bird asked. "'More one likes see drowned batch,' said Father Albatross 'and I feel sorry captain. He fine fellow, bright eyes dark curly plumage, would handsome creature he wings. He going giving orders desperate vain composure, wherever he went went large dog dark bright curls like his own. I seen ship before, I know dog. His name Carlo. He captain's property, ship's pet. Usually he quiet, sometimes, blows, he ill; commonly he deck, blinking self-sufficient air imagine. However, to-day, moment danger imminent, he seemed aware it, one idea subject, keep close his master. He got front he moved about, sat his feet he stood still, jumped he shouted his orders, licked his hands he seized ropes. In fact, he troublesome. But expect creature requires four legs go with, cannot rise earth even these, does not move many yards day I go miles hour? He _can_ swim, certain length time. However, he probably quiet enough now; perhaps lucky chance rolled his master's feet sea.' "'Have men contrivance escaping occasions?' mother bird inquired. "'They boats, go ship hold longer. It much put little one fly storm wings failed.' "'Perhaps boats good order ship not,' said Mother Albatross, practical gift. 'Were boats one?' "'There were. I saw one lowered, quickly filled men, eager snatch last chance life. "'Was captain it?' she asked. "'No. He stayed ship gave orders. The dog stayed him. Another boat lowered filled ship went down.' "'Was captain it?' "'Again, no. He stayed vessel others him. They sinking I came you. With last glance I gave I saw captain standing quite still near wheel. The dog sitting his feet. They looking one direction--away sea. But distress yourself? It long since. Think little one, let us thankful belong superior race. We might born without wings, like poor sailors.' "'I cannot help grieving captain,' said Mother Albatross. 'When spoke his bright eyes handsome plumage I thought you; I feel die? I wish he gone boats.' "'I doubt he would fared better,' said father bird. 'The second boat must swamped sinking ship; far probable get land.' "'Nevertheless, I hope fly direction to-morrow,' she said, 'and bring word whether traces catastrophe.' "The following morning Father Albatross set he desired. The ship foundered quite near side island, including little excursion see first boat still water, he expected back shortly. "He returned even sooner Mother Albatross hoped, descended side nest much agitation his majestic form capable displaying. "'Wonders never cease!' he exclaimed. 'What think island?' "'I could not guess I try till next hatching season,' said his mate; 'and I beg keep suspense. I equal slightest trial nerves. It quite enough mother.' "'The captain one two men here,' said albatross. 'What think that? You able see yourself, show youngster men like bargain. It is strange escaped; lazy, self-sufficient dog them.' "'I cannot possibly leave young one present,' said Mother Albatross, 'and he certainly cannot get far. It provoking men leave island I see them.' "'There much fear that,' her mate answered. 'A lucky wave brought shore, take good many lucky waves bring ship carry home.' "Father Albatross right; his mate saw strangers sooner she expected. Her nest, though built ground, highest point island, shipwrecked men soon made way; Mother Albatross ample chance seeing bright eyes captain scanned horizon line keen anxiety. Presently fell upon bird herself. "'What splendid creatures are!' he said his companion; 'and grandly fearless. I never one islands breed before. What pity cannot understand one! That fellow there, stretching his noble wings, might take message bring us help.' "'He fine creature,' said Mother Albatross, peeping captain her nest; 'that is, he would he wings, could speak properly, instead making unmusical jabbering like monkey.' "'I would give good deal one report first boat,' captain went on. 'Heaven knows I would content die I could know safe. But I am afraid--I am afraid; oh! dear!' "And captain paced down, consoling him. "'He does not seem tame one might expect,' said Mother Albatross, 'he is restless. But possibly he hungry.' "Truly great amusement mother bird watch strangers her nest, question her mate peculiarities. "'What he now?' she asked one occasion, captain reading paper he taken note-book his pocket. "'That letter,' said Father Albatross. 'And look I gather that, like ourselves, he got young one somewhere, wherever his nest may be.' "'How gather that?' his mate inquired. "'Because writing large,' answered Father Albatross. 'It one peculiarities creatures smaller larger write. That letter young one; probably his own.' "'Very remarkable indeed,' said Mother Albatross. 'And he _now_?' "'Now he writing himself,' said her mate; 'and observe see statement confirmed. See much smaller he writes!' "The captain indeed torn sheet his note-book, busy scribbling upon his knees. Whether sight papers familiar memory Carlo, whether he merely moved one doggish impulses little understand, impossible say; captain began write, Carlo began wag his tail, he wagged without pause weariness till captain finished, keeping his nearest eye half open, fixed upon paper captain's moving hand. Once he sat his haunches put his nose letter. "'That right, old fellow, kiss it,' said captain. 'I telling her you. Heaven send she may ever read it, poor child!' "At Carlo became frantic, persistent pushing his nose paper, captain fain pocket his writing materials, game play 'ship's dog,' latter condescendingly joined minutes, lay before, shutting his eyes air seemed imply-- "'I see, poor fellow, do not understand me.' "The hardships endured small remnant ship's company great. They managed live. The weather fine, first trouble permanent shelter. Perhaps, too, spite seaman's knowledge position in, dim hope ship her course been, picking off, buoyed fancy 'it worth while.' But ship appeared; built hut near albatross's nest, began talk seasons, provision future. They kept look-out turns daylight, night moon stars made distance visible. Every morning sun rising sea met captain's keen eyes scanning horizon, every evening closed day's fruitless watch, sun's going saw captain's brown hands clasped together he said, 'God's done!' "So days became weeks, weeks ripened months, Carlo became used his new home, happy it, kept watch his master, took his ease usual. But men's appearance changed, clothes began look shabby. In first place wearing out, and, secondly, seemed--as say--to 'getting large' them, hang loosely untidily upon gaunt frames. The captain's eyes looked larger sadder, his voice grew hollow sunset, threads white began show among his dark curls, increased number day day. "'His plumage white soon,' said Mother Albatross. 'I suppose it is climate it.' "'He getting older,' said her mate; 'men, like ourselves, get white get old.' "'But he short time,' said Mother Albatross. "'He much older, however,' said father bird, his mate said more; she knew tone his voice he got end his available information subject, beyond point he like pressed. "'It is hard, it is hard, captain, I cannot submit do,' said one men one day. He captain sitting side side look out, elbows knees, chins upon hands. "'And yet it is harder you,' said captain. 'One must die day. It is that. And single man, Barker, without ties.' "The man stooped down, taking one Carlo's long ears his hand, played absently it, he said-- "'No, sir. I married, it is true, children. I feel you, sir, heart. But little house Plymouth, that, God knows, I see moment clearly I see you, there is girl either forgotten me, breaking good heart ever beat woman's breast man her husband, that is fast bound upon rock sea-birds. The Lord knows best, captain, comes hard. We troubles, sir.' "The captain laid his hand upon his shoulder. "'Forgive me,' he said. 'God comfort you! God bless you!' And, rising hurriedly, he went forward, big tears breaking his cheeks, sea sky dancing together his eyes. "'What dream night, Barker?' said captain, another day. "'Home, sir,' said Barker. "'Strange!' said captain. 'So I. In time here, I never dreamed island, day's work, even seeing sail. I dream England night night.' "'It is myself, sir,' said Barker. 'I am Plymouth half time, I may say. And I dream father's old home Surrey.' "'Are men going change feathers, think?' Mother Albatross inquired her mate. 'They wretched appearance. Only dog looks like himself.' (The first excitement pity curiosity subsided, good couple naturally inclined critical.) "'I detest dog,' said Father Albatross. 'His idleness arrogance make quite sick. I think I want exercise, too, I mean good flight to-day;' and, spreading his broad wings, bird sailed away. "His excursion quite dispel his irritability. When he returned, he settled captain, sitting listlessly, usual, Carlo his feet. "'If would exert yourself,' began Father Albatross, 'something might come it. You getting bad dog. Spread arms yours, see them! If could fly matter miles, would see sail--and that is reason expect.' "'What matter birds to-day?' said captain, rather irritable mood himself. 'They silent enough generally'--for voice albatross rarely heard sea. "'Move arms, I tell you,' croaked albatross. 'Up down--so!--and follow me.' "'I shall dog going next,' muttered captain. 'Come along, Carlo.' And turning his back Father Albatross, he moved away. "'He does not understand you,' said Mother Albatross, endeavoured, proper, soothe her mate's irritability, make peace. 'Could not take message ship yourself? It nothing magnificent wings, his fault, poor creature, he formed like you.' "'You speak sensibly, dear' said Father Albatross; he took flight sea. "But he returned even worse mood before. "'Nothing equal stupidity human beings,' he observed. 'I addressed captain. "There is island shipwrecked men miles north-east," said I. "We shall see land ten days, madam," says captain lady deck. "There is big fool wrecked island north-east north," I cried. "If skill sparrow could see eyes five minutes." "It is remarkable," said captain, "I never heard one albatross make sound before." "And never again," said I; "it is waste time talk you. It will not take long put water like rest." And away I came.' "'I do not understand cry human beings myself,' said his mate, 'and I am rather glad I not; would irritate me. Perhaps he understand you.' "'They stupid alike,' said father bird; 'but I done best, shall disturb more.' "The captain watched till sunset, folded his hands, bent his head usual, last lay sleep. He dreamt England, home--of home his long since, young wife, dead years ago. He dreamt he lay, early morning, sunny room little cottage lived, where, summer, morning sun awoke much later birds. He dreamt his wife him, she thought he asleep, that, thinking, she put her arms round his neck awaken him--that he lay still, pretended slumbering on, that, lying, he saw her face bright unearthly beauty, her eyes fixed intensity expression held like spell. Then he felt her warm face come nearer his, she kissed his cheeks, he heard her say, 'Wake up, darling, I something show you.' Again she repeated vehemently, 'Awake! Awake! Look! Look!' he opened his eyes. "He lying look-out, Carlo licking his face. It dream, yet voice strong clear his ears, 'Awake! Awake! Look! Look!' "A heavier hand his wife's his shoulder, Barker's rough voice (hoarser usual), repeated words his dream. "The captain's eyes followed outstretched hand horizon; his voice grew hoarse, he exclaimed-- "'My God! sail!'" * * * * * Ida leaning little old lady's footstool now. She sat upright, her pale face whiter will not. "_Did_ ship take away?" she asked eagerly. "Yes, dear. Their signals seen, ship took home friends, believed dead." "Do people drowned--I mean thought drowned--ever come home _really_?" child asked. "Yes, really. Ida, dear, I want remember that, regards captain crew, true story." Ida clasped her hands passionately together. "Oh, Mrs. Overtheway! Do think Papa ever come home?" "My child! dear child!" sobbed little old lady. "I think he will." ... * * * * * "And he _is_ alive--he coming home!" Ida cried, she recounted Mrs. Overtheway's story Nurse, knew principal fact already. "And she told way frighten me. I cry laugh though, silly; she said I must foolish, brave like captain's daughter, I ought thank GOD good me, children poor men died never fathers back world: I thankful, thankful! Only like mill going head, I cannot help crying. And Papa wrote long letter he island, he sent Mrs. Overtheway Uncle Garbett told I fond her, she would tell nicely, she read it, give she told me. And lovely letter, island, poor Barker, dear old Carlo, beautiful birds, too, Mrs. Overtheway made great deal herself. And please, Nursey, take black frock never let see again, Captain really coming home, and, oh! I wish he would come!"

She putting her treasures look at, carved fans workboxes, beads handkerchiefs feathers, new letter old one--when Captain came. * * * * * A week postman delivered letter contained wonderful news Ida, he brought another Mrs. Overtheway's green gate, addressed handwriting--the Captain's. It Captain, however, Ida. "MY DEAR, DEAR MRS. OVERTHEWAY, "We got Saturday night, happy. Papa says come see us? I got little room myself, I got glass case I keep things Papa ever sent me, his letters. I bought part sovereign Uncle Garbett gave I came away. Do know he kind I came away. He kissed me, said, 'GOD bless you, dear! You good child, good child;' know kind him, I do not think I ever good somehow him. But he kind made cry, I could not say anything, I gave great many kisses, I want know I love Papa best. Carlo put his nose knee, I cannot help making blots. He came us railway carriage, ate nearly sandwiches. When he Papa roll hearthrug together, I mix curls pretend I cannot tell which. Only really Papa's got grey hairs them: _we know why_. I always kiss white hairs I find them, he says he thinks I shall kiss colour again. He kind! I said I did not like Nurse wear her black dress now, she said best one she had, she must wear afternoon; Papa said he would get us bright things, he says English people dress mud-colour, people live much sunnier, brighter countries wear gay clothes. So went shop morning, I asked get things blue, his favourite colour. But he said he choose Nurse's things himself. So he asked smart dress, man asked kind; I said nurse, he brought lot prints, last Papa chose one yellow ground carnations it. He wanted much got another one big flowers, man said meant curtains, dresses, I persuaded get it; he says he wishes he had, much best. Then he got red shawl, bonnet ribbon kind green tartan. Nurse much pleased, she said smart half. But Papa told her she knew better, never seen parrots East Indian Islands. Yesterday went church. Carlo came too, got porch, Papa put his hand, said, 'Prayers, sir!' Carlo lay stayed till came out. Papa says he used he going say prayers board ship, Carlo always lay quietly deck till service over. Before went church Papa gave little parcel sealed up, put plate. I asked was, he said thankoffering. Before one prayers clergyman said something. I do not quite remember words, began, 'A sailor desires thank GOD--' oh! I _knew_ was, I squeezed his hand tight, I tried pray every word prayer, I began think island--but I _did_ try! And indeed I try very, thankful, I happy! Papa got letter Barker morning, going choose wedding present. He sent photograph girl he going marry, I rather disappointed, I thought she would lovely, only, perhaps, rather sad-looking; she does not look pretty, sitting rather vulgar dress, photograph book her hand. Her dress tartan, queer-looking waist, know, like Nurse's, coloured picture, her brooch gilt. Papa laughs, says Barker likes colour, he does; he says he thinks she nice face, he knows she good, fond Barker, Barker thinks her beautiful. He did not write he went see her, like Papa. He walked house, found her sitting window his photograph her hand. She said she restless day, she could nothing sit look it. Was not funny? She ill thinking he dead, Barker says she nearly died joy seeing again. Papa sends his love, I send lots lots mine, millions kisses. And please, _please_ come see us can, I miss every morning, I love you, always grateful affectionate "IDA." "P.S.--I telling Papa stories bits. And know he went sleep whilst I telling Mrs. Moss!"

The little old lady comes green gate, looks way, face window now; something made her start instant, looking-glass, smart toilette-table brought back window Ida used kneel, nursery spare bedroom more. That episode dull house quiet street over, gone by. The old lady thinks rather sadly she goes bells calling.
