 HOLIDAY HOUSE: A SERIES OF TALES. HOLIDAY HOUSE. CHAPTER I. CHIT CHAT. A school-boy, dog, walnut tree, The strike  them, better be. Laura Harry Graham could scarcely feel sure ever mama, she died yet young indeed; Frank, years older, recollected perfectly well pretty playthings she used give him, missed his kind, good mama extremely, he one day asked he might "go shop buy new mama?" Frank often afterwards thought time also, he kneeled beside her bed say his prayers, he sat upon her knee hear funny stories good boys bad boys--all interesting, told purpose show much happier obedient children are, waste time idleness folly. Boys girls think know road happiness without mistake, choose looks gayest pleasantest first, though older people, travelled road already, tell difficult path one ends agreeably; begin walk young, really find "wisdom's ways ways pleasantness, her paths peace." It truly remarked Solomon, "even child known his doings, whether his work pure, whether right." Therefore, though Frank yet little boy, his friends, observed carefully he attended his mama's instructions, frequently he studied his Bible, diligently he learned his lessons, prophesied merry, lively child, laughing eyes, dimpled cheeks, would yet grow good useful man; especially became evident that, blessing God, he early turned away broad road leadeth destruction, every living person would naturally walk, led narrow path leadeth eternal life. When his mama, Lady Graham, long painful illness, last taken away better world, she many years preparing, her sorrow anxiety seemed she left behind her three dear children, entirely care papa, Sir Edward Graham; many prayers tears she tried make her mind easy future education, future happiness. Sir Edward felt extreme grief death Lady Graham, instead able remain home his young family, interest his mind he would wish done, attending them, he ordered Dr. Bell, set immediately Paris, Rome, Naples, hoped he might leave his distresses behind he travelled, events, forget them. Luckily children good, kind uncle, Major David Graham, grandmama, Lady Harriet Graham, exceedingly happy take charge them, observing house could cheerful without little people there, would constant amusement trying make Frank, Harry, Laura, happy possible, even still happier. "That thing I almost afraid of!" said Sir Edward, smiling. "Uncles grandmamas kind, small family quite spoiled indulgence." "Not leave old vixen, Mrs. Crabtree, governor nursery," answered Major Graham, laughing. "She ought drummer regiment, she fond rod! I believe never tyrant since time nursery-maids invented. Poor Harry would pass his life dark closet, like Baron Trenck, Mrs. Crabtree her way!" "She means well. I certain Mrs. Crabtree devotedly fond children, would go fire water serve them; she little severe perhaps. Her idea is, never forgive first fault, never hear second, probably true enough. At events, her harshness best remedy extreme indulgence; therefore let beg mother seldom interfere her 'method,' especially respect Harry Laura. As Frank, boys like him, might make bonfire birch rods canes. He old nursery discipline now, must flogged school, deserving all, till he goes sea next year friend Gordon, promised rate volunteer first class, board Thunderbolt." In spite Mrs. Crabtree's admirable "system" children, Harry Laura became, time, two heedless, frolicsome beings world, whipped almost every morning; days discovered whipping mistake, children made good without it; though old-fashioned people still say--and such, too, take God truth guide--the old plan succeeded best, "spare rod spoil child." When Lady Harriet Major Graham spoke kindly Harry Laura, anything wrong done, felt sad sorry, severest punishments Mrs. Crabtree, frequently observed, "if children shut dark room alone, nothing do, would still find way mischievous, deserving punished." "Harry!" said Major Graham one day, "you remind monkey belonged colonel regiment formerly. He famous contriving play sorts pranks one supposed possible, I recollect valuable French clock, malicious creature seemed particularly determined break. Many time I caught fact, saved beautiful clock; one day, suddenly summoned room, I hastily fastened his chain table, he could possibly, even full extent his paw, much touch glass case. I observed impatiently watching departure, felt misgiving he expected get better me; shutting door, I took peep key-hole, think Jack done, Harry? for, next Mr. Monkey himself, certainly cleverest contriver mischief I know." "What he do?" asked Harry eagerly; "did he throw stone clock?" "No! his leg several inches longer his arm, turned his tail towards his object, he stretched his hind-paw, I could rush back, splendid alabaster clock upset broken shivers." Laura soon became quite mischievous Harry, surprising, she whole year older, twice often scolded Mrs. Crabtree. Neither children intended harm, heedless lively romps, would twenty worlds told lie, done shabby thing, taken belong them. They greedy either, would account resembled Peter Grey, school Frank, spent his pocket-money, borrowed great deal people's, squander pastry-cook's, saying, he wished possible eat three dinners, two breakfasts, five suppers every day. Harry cruel boy either; he never lashed his pony, beat his dog, pinched his sister, killed butterflies, though he often chased fun, one day he even defended wasp, risk stung, Mrs. Crabtree intended kill it. "Nasty, useless vermin!" said she angrily, "What business world! coming people's houses, nothing do! They sting torment every body! Bees different, make honey." "And wasps make jelly!" said Harry resolutely, he opened window, shook happy wasp his pocket handkerchief. Mrs. Crabtree allowed pets description her territories, ordered children happy without nonsense. When Laura's canary-bird escaped one unlucky day cage, Mrs. Crabtree strongly suspected Major Graham, secretly opened door, she long declared war upon bulfinches, white mice, parrots, kittens, dogs, bantams, gold fish, observing animals made noise soiled house, therefore every creature remain home, "birds air, fish sea, beasts desert." She seemed always watching hopes Harry Laura might something ought punished for; Mrs. Crabtree certainly ears people, slept one eye open, as, whatever might done, night day, she overheard lowest whisper mischief, appeared able see going dark. When Harry little boy, he sometimes put corner, wrong, apparently quite sensible he deserved punished, once, terribly scolded Mrs. Crabtree, he drew his stool beside her chair, funny penitent face, twirling his thumbs other, saying, "Now, Mrs. Crabtree! look good boy I going be!" "You good boy!" replied she contemptuously: "No! no! world turned cream-cheese first!" Lady Harriet gave Harry Laura closet own, she allowed keep toys, nobody could help laughing see that, amidst whole collection, seldom one unbroken. Frank wrote list he found crowded little store-room, amused often reading afterwards. There three dolls without faces, horse legs, drum hole top, cart without wheels, churn bottom, kite without tale, skipping-rope handles, cup ball lost string. Lady Harriet called closet hospital decayed toys, she often employed herself doctor, mending legs arms soldiers, horses, dolls, though her skill seldom succeeded long, play-things must made cast-iron last week Harry. One cold winter morning Laura entered nursery, she found large fire blazing, her wax dolls sitting row within fender staring flames. Harry intended mischief occasion, great his vexation Laura burst tears, showed faces running hot stream upon beautiful silk frocks, completely ruined, doll nose remaining. Another time, Harry pricked hole his beautiful large gas ball, wishing see gas could possibly escape, which, moment, shrivelled useless empty bladder,--and his kite flying clouds, Harry often wished he could tied tail himself, fly also air like bird, see every thing. Mrs. Crabtree always wore prodigious bunch jingling keys her pocket, rung whenever she moved, she carried dinner bell her pocket, Frank said like rattlesnake giving warning her approach, great use, everybody time put look good behaviour she arrived. Even Betty, nursery-maid, felt terror Mrs. Crabtree's entrance, obliged work harder six house-maids united. Frank told her one day he thought brooms might soon invented, would go steam brush carpets themselves, but, meantime, grain dust could lurk corner nursery without dislodged. Betty would required ten hands, twenty pair feet, work expected; grate looked like jet, windows would soiled cambric handkerchief, carpet switched many tea-leaves, Frank thought Mrs. Crabtree often took several additional cups tea order leave plentiful supply leaves sweeping floor next morning. If Laura Harry left breakfast, Mrs. Crabtree kept carefully till dinner time, obliged finish whole tasting meat; refused dinner, remains kept supper. Mrs. Crabtree always informed she "for good," though Harry never could see good either them; she mentioned many poor children would glad eat despised, he often wished hungry beggars his hot dinner, he would gladly spared them; Harry really generous, he would lived upon air, he might use anybody. Time passed on, Lady Harriet engaged master hours a-day teach children lessons, even Mrs. Crabtree found fault Harry Laura, except respect good behaviour memories like sieve, let every thing desired keep mind. They seemed always hope, somehow other, Mrs. Crabtree turned her back, she would never shew her face again; promises better conduct "wind without rain,"--very loud plenty them, good effect seen afterwards. Among her many torments, Mrs. Crabtree rolled Laura's hair every night sides her head, large stiff curl-papers, till round hard walnuts, which, she tied night-cap, tightly possible all, saying would curl hair still better. Laura could lay part her head pillow, without suffering much pain that, night night, she sat bed, Mrs. Crabtree bustled room, quietly took cruel papers out, though she punished severely so, she obeyed orders last lay wide awake half night torture; small comfort Laura afterwards, Lady Harriet's visitors frequently admired forest long glossy ringlets adorned her head, complimented Mrs. Crabtree trouble must cost her keep charming hair order. Often Laura wish ornamenting wig-block, rather her head; one day Lady Harriet laughed heartily, strangers admired her little grand-daughter's ringlets, Laura asked, anxiously, would like cut longest, keep her sake. "Your hair curl like cork-screw," said Frank, laughing. "If I want draw cork beer bottle day, I shall borrow one ringlets, Laura!" "You may laugh, Frank, fun death me," answered poor Laura, gravely shaking her curls him. "I wish bald, like uncle David! During night, I cannot lie still account tiresome curls, day I dare stir fear spoiling them, never head." "Nor head! How pleasant must Mrs. Crabtree combing scolding, scolding combing, hours every day! Poor Laura! must get Dr. Bell say shall taken pain death, then, perhaps, grandmama would order Irish reapers cut sickle." "Frank! lucky boy school, nursery! I wish next year would come immediately, I shall governess, good-bye Mrs. Crabtree, wearisome curl-papers." "I do not like school!" said Harry. "It perfect nonsense plague lessons now. All big people read write, so, course, I shall able like others. There hurry it!" Never amiable, pious, excellent boy Frank, read his Bible attentively, said his prayers regularly every morning evening, he soon learned know his duty it. Though he laughed heartily scrapes Harry Laura constantly fell into, he often also helped difficulties; different elderly boys, find odd kind pleasure teazing younger children--pulling hair--pinching arms--twitching away dinners--and twenty plans tormenting, Frank never attempted enjoy, he often gave Harry Laura great deal kind, sober, good advice, listened attentively new distress, generally forgot soon spirits rose. Frank came home upon Saturdays Sundays, he attended week Mr. Lexicon's academy, he gradually became clever, masters praised his extraordinary attention, covered medals, Major Graham often filled his pockets reward money, he ran towards nearest shop spend his little fortune buying present somebody. Frank scarcely ever wanted anything himself, he always wished contrive kind generous plan people; Major Graham used say, "if boy sixpence world, he would lay penny tarts distribute among half-a-dozen his friends." He even saved his pocket-money once, three whole months, purchase gown Mrs. Crabtree, looked almost good-humoured space five minutes, Frank presented her, saying, his joyous merry voice, "Mrs. Crabtree! I wish health wear it, strength tear it, money buy another!" Certainly never gown before! It chosen Frank Harry together, thought nothing could perfect. The colour bright apple-green, would put body's teeth edge look it, whole dotted large round spots every colour, box wafers showered upon surface. Laura wished Mrs. Crabtree might receive present every day, put her good-humour, nearly three weeks passed this, without single scold heard nursery; Frank observed he thought Mrs. Crabtree would soon quite practice. "Laura!" said Major Graham, looking sly one morning, "have heard new rules Mrs. Crabtree made?" "No!" replied she great alarm; "what they?" "In first place, positively tear destroy three frocks a-day; secondly, Harry must never get passion, unless angry; thirdly, either take medicine, make wry faces, except taste bad; fourthly, must never speak ill Mrs. Crabtree herself, she room; fifthly, jump windows, long get door"---- "Yes!" interrupted Laura, laughing, "and sixthly, uncle David joking, frightened anything he says!" "Seventhly, next spill grandmama's bottle ink, Harry must drink every drop." "Very well! he may swallow sheet blotting paper afterwards, put away taste." "I wish every body writes book, obliged swallow it," said Harry. "It waste time reading, might amusing ourselves. Frank sat mooning book two hours yesterday wanted play. I sure, day his head burst knowledge." "That never happen you, Master Harry," answered Major Graham; "you head, pin, much furniture either them." CHAPTER II. THE GRAND FEAST. She gave tea without bread, She whipp'd soundly, sent bed. Nursery Rhymes. Lady Harriet Graham extremely thin, delicate, old lady, pale face, sweet gentle voice, children delighted hear, always spoke kindly them, sounded like music, loud, rough tones Mrs. Crabtree. She wore her grey hair, become almost white widow's cap covered her head. The rest her dress generally black velvet, she usually sat comfortable arm-chair fire-side, watching her grandchildren play, large work-bag her side, prodigious Bible open table her. Lady Harriet often said made her young see joyous gambols Harry Laura; unable longer bear noise, she sometimes kept quiet, telling delightful stories happened herself she young. Once upon time, however, Lady Harriet suddenly became ill, Dr. Bell said she must spend days country, change air, accordingly she determined passing quiet week Holiday House her relations, Lord Lady Rockville. Meanwhile, Harry Laura left sole care Mrs. Crabtree, might expected would feel frightened her, she reigning monarch house, ever. Harry would obey he loved, held little finger; terrors Mrs. Crabtree, her cat-of-nine-tails, generally forgotten soon she left room; therefore he thought little first many threats she held out, he behaved ill, he listened seriously his dear sick grandmama told him, faint weak voice, day her departure home, well he ought behave her absence, one remained maids keep order, she hoped Mrs. Crabtree would write her letter full good news his excellent conduct. Harry felt he would gladly sit still without stirring, till his grandmama came back, could please her; never one determined good boy he, moment Lady Harriet's carriage came round door. Laura, Frank, Harry helped carry pillows, boxes, books, baskets necessary journey, seemed fifty; arranged cushions comfortably possible, watched sorrowfully grandmama, kindly embracing both, carefully supported Major Graham her maid Harrison, chariot. Uncle David gave children pretty picture-book taking leave, said, he stepping carriage, "Now, children! I one piece serious, important advice give all, attend me!--never crack nuts teeth!" When carriage driven off, Mrs. Crabtree became busy scolding Betty, storming Jack foot-boy, cleaning her shoes well enough, she left Harry Laura standing passage, knowing exactly ought first, Frank, seeing looking rather melancholy bewildered loss grandmama, stopped moment he passed way school, said kind, affectionate voice, "Now, Harry Laura, listen you!--here grand opportunity show everybody, trusted ourselves, without getting scrapes, grandmama ever ill again, obliged go away, she need feel sad anxious she to-day. I mean become nine times attentive lessons usual morning, show trust-worthy are, wise, pray march straight nursery yourselves. I arranged gown cap Mrs. Crabtree's large arm-chair, look like herself possible, may reminded soon she come back, must behave like mice cat out. Good bye! Say alphabet backward, count fingers half-an-hour, Mrs. Crabtree appears again, pray jump window joy." Harry Laura proceeding directly towards nursery, Frank recommended, unluckily observed passing drawing-room door, wide open; Harry peeped in, began idly wandering round tables cabinets. Not ten minutes elapsed commenced racing mad, perfectly screaming joy, laughing loudly funny tricks, old gentleman lived next door, nearly sent message ask joke was. Presently Harry Laura ran stairs till housemaid quite fatigued running them. They jumped upon fine damask sofas drawing-room, stirred fire till blaze, rushed balcony, upsetting one two geraniums myrtle. They spilt Lady Harriet's perfumes handkerchiefs,--they looked beautiful books pictures,--they tumbled many pretty Dresden china figures floor,--they wound little French clock till broken,--they made musical work-box play tunes, set Chinese mandarins nodding, till nearly nodded heads off. In short, much mischief seldom done short time, till last Harry, perfectly worn laughing running, threw large arm-chair, Laura, her ringlets tumbling frightful confusion her face, beads her coral necklace rolling floor, tossed herself sofa beside him. "Oh! fun!" cried Harry, ecstacy delight; "I wish Frank here, crowds little boys girls, play us day! It would good joke, Laura, write ask little cousins companions drink tea to-morrow evening! Their mamas could never guess leave grandmama invite everybody, I dare say might gather quite large party! oh! enchanting!" Laura laughed heartily she heard proposal Harry's, without hesitating moment it, she joyously placed herself Lady Harriet's writing-table, scribbled multitude little notes, large text, twenty young friends, times asked Lady Harriet spend evening her. Laura felt much puzzled know usually said card invitation, many consultations, she Harry thought last, nicely expressed, wrote words upon large sheet paper friends:-- Master Harry Graham Miss Laura wish honour drinking tea us to-morrow, six of the clock. (Signed) Harry Laura. Laura afterwards singed hole her muslin frock, lighting one Vesta matches seal numerous notes; Harry dropped burning sealing-wax his hand, hurry assisting her; he thought little accident matter, ran away see cards could sent immediately. Now, lived house old footman, called Andrew, remembered Harry Laura since quite little babies; he often looked exceedingly sad sorry suffered punishment Mrs. Crabtree. He ready anything world pleased children, would carried message moon, shown way. Many odd jobs private messages he already employed Harry, called Andrew stairs, entreating carry absurd notes fast possible, deliver immediately, greatest consequence. Upon hearing this, old Andrew lost moment, threw his hat, instantly started off, looking like twopenny postman, he carried prodigious parcel invitations, Harry Laura stood drawing-room window, almost screaming joy saw set out, observed that, oblige them, he actually ran along street sort trot, fast he could possibly go. Presently, however, he certainly stop single minute, Laura saw order take peep one notes, he might ascertain about; he never carried letters without so, she thought quite natural, glad he finished, rapidly pursued his way again. Next morning, Mrs. Crabtree Betty became much surprised observe number smart livery servants knocked street door, gave cards, astonishment became still greater, old Andrew brought whole parcel Harry Laura, immediately broke seals, read contents corner together. "What there, Master Graham?" cried Mrs. Crabtree, angrily, "how dare body venture touch grandmama's letters?" "They grandmama!--they us!--every one them!" answered Harry, dancing room joy, waving notes his head. "Look direction! For Master Miss Graham! put spectacles, read yourself, Mrs. Crabtree! What delightful fun! house full egg!" Mrs. Crabtree seemed completely puzzled think this, looked much she know exactly angry at, ready passion possible, Harry burst laughing, he said, "Only think Mrs. Crabtree! every body coming tea us!--all cousins, besides Peter Grey, Robert Stewart, Charles Forrester, Adelaide Cunninghame, Diana Wentworth, John Fordyce, Edmund Ashford, Frank Abercromby, Ned Russel, Tom ----" "The boy distracted!" exclaimed Betty, staring astonishment. "What mean, Master Harry?" "And gave leave invite company grandmama's house?" cried Mrs. Crabtree, snatching notes, angrily thrusting fire. "I never heard things life before, Master Harry! sure eggs eggs, shall repent this, one morsel cake, anything else shall give party; no! much crust bread, thimbleful tea!" Harry Laura never thought catastrophe before; always saw great table covered every thing could named tea, whenever little friends came visit them, whether rose floor, brought Aladdin's lamp, never considered possible table would provided usual occasions, terrible speech Mrs. Crabtree's frightened wits. What done! They knew experience she always whatever she threatened, something great deal worse, began bursting tears, begging Mrs. Crabtree excuse them, give cakes tea little visitors, might well spoken one Chinese mandarins, she shook her head, positive look, declaring nothing appear upon table except always brought supper--two biscuits two cups milk. "Therefore say it!" added she, sternly. "I best friend, Master Harry, trying teach Miss Laura duty, save breath cool porridge." Poor Harry Laura looked perfectly ill fright vexation thought happen next, Mrs. Crabtree sat her knitting, grumbling herself, dropping her stitches every minute rage irritation. Old Andrew felt exceedingly sorry he heard distress difficulty Harry in, hour party approached, he good-naturedly spread large table dining-room, he put many cups, saucers, plates, spoons Laura chose direct; spite his trouble, though looked grand, nothing whatever eat drink, except two dry biscuits, two miserable cups milk, seemed become smaller every time Harry looked them. Presently clock struck six, Harry listened hour much prisoner would condemned cell Newgate, feeling dreaded time last arrived. Soon afterwards, several handsome carriages drove door filled little Masters Misses, hurried joyfully house, talking laughing way stairs, evidently quite happy coming tea, poor Harry Laura almost wished floor would open swallow up, shrunk distant corner room, quite ashamed show faces. The young ladies dressed best frocks, pink sashes, pink shoes; little boys appeared holiday clothes, hair newly brushed, faces washed. The whole party dined two of the clock, hungry hawks, looking eagerly round, whenever entered, see tea-table, evidently surprised nothing yet put down. Laura Harry soon afterwards heard visitors whispering Norwich buns, rice cakes, spunge biscuits, maccaroons; Peter Grey loud praise party George Lorraine's night before, immense plum-cake sugared like snow storm, covered crowds beautiful amusing mottoes; mention quantity noisy crackers, exploded like pistols; besides which, glass hot jelly handed little guest he sent home. Every time door opened, eyes anxiously turned round, expecting grand feast brought in; quite contrary--it Andrew showing hungry visitors; Harry felt unspeakably wretched, that, kind fairy could turned Norwich bun moment, he would gladly consented cut pieces, his ravenous guests might satisfied. Charles Forrester particularly good-natured boy, Harry last took courage beckoned remote corner room, he confessed, whispers, real state affairs tea, sadly distressed he Laura felt, nothing whatever give among many visitors, seeing Mrs. Crabtree kept her determination affording provisions. "What done!" said Charles, anxiously, he felt extremely sorry his little friends. "If Mama home, she would gladly sent whatever liked tea, unluckily she dining out! I saw loaf bread lying table home evening, she would make quite welcome to! Shall I run home, fast possible, fetch it? That would, rate, better nothing!" Poor Charles Forrester lame, therefore, he talked running he could hardly walk, Lady Forrester's house stood near, he soon reached home, when, snatching loaf, he hurried back towards street his prize, quite delighted see large substantial looked. Scarcely he reached door, however, housekeeper ran hastily out, saying, "Stop, Mr. Charles! stop! sure running away loaf tea, parrot must her supper too. What want bread?" "Never mind, Mrs. Comfit!" answered Charles, hastening faster ever, he grasped precious loaf firmly his hand, limped along prodigious rate, "Polly getting fat, she better fasting one day." Mrs. Comfit, enormously fat herself, became angry remark, she seemed quite desperate recover loaf, hurried forward overtake Charles, old housekeeper heavy breathless, young gentleman lame, seemed even chance race. Harry stood his door, impatiently hoping receive prize, eagerly stretched his arms encourage his friend, impossible say runners might arrive first. Harry sometimes heard race two old women tied sacks, he thought could scarcely move difficulty; moment Charles reached door, he stumbled stone, fell ground. Mrs. Comfit instantly rushed up, seizing loaf, she carried triumph, leaving two little friends ready cry vexation, quite loss plan attempt next. Mean time, sad riot arisen dining-room, boys called loudly tea; young ladies drew chairs round table, wait till ready. Still nothing appeared; every body wondered long wait nice cakes sweetmeats must, course, coming; longer delayed, expected. The last feast, first fray, generally Peter Grey, lost patience, seized one two biscuits, he middle greedily devouring, Laura returned Harry dining-room, observed he done. "Peter Grey!" said she, holding her head, trying look dignified, "you exceedingly naughty boy, help yourself! As punishment rude, shall nothing eat evening." "If I help myself, nobody else seems likely give supper! I appear person taste anything to-night," answered Peter, laughing, impudent boy took cup milk, drank off, saying, "Here is good health, Miss Laura, excellent appetite everybody!" Upon hearing absurd speech, boys began laughing, made signs, eating fingers hunger. Then Peter called Lady Harriet's house "Famine Castle," pretended he would swallow knives like Indian juggler. "We must learn live upon air, spoons eat with," said John Fordyce. "Harry! shall I help mouthful moonshine?" "Peter! would like roasted fly?" asked Frank Abercromby, catching one window. "I dare say excellent hungry people,--or slice buttered wall?" "Or stewed spider?" asked Peter. "Shall cannibals, eat one another?" "What use forks, nothing stick upon them?" asked George Maxwell, throwing floor. "No buns!--no fruit!--no cakes!--no nothing!" "What tea-cups, tea?" cried Frank Abercromby, pulling table-cloth till whole affair fell prostrate floor. After this, riotous boys tossed plates air, caught them, becoming, last, outrageous, poor old Andrew called "meal mob." Never much broken china seen dining-room before! It lay scattered floor, countless fragments, looking bull china shop, suddenly Mrs. Crabtree herself opened door walked in, aspect rage enough petrify milestone. Now old Andrew long trying his power render boys quiet contented. He made speech,--he chased ring-leaders round room,--and he thrown his stick Peter, seemed riotous,--but vain; became worse worse, laughing fits, calling Andrew "the police-officer," "the bailiff." It different story, however, Mrs. Crabtree appeared, flaming fury, she might blown powder-mill. Nobody could help afraid her. Even Peter stood stock-still, seemed withering away nothing, she looked him; she began scold her furious manner, boy ventured look ground. A large pair tawse became visible her hand, every heart sunk fright, riotous visitors began get behind other, huddle sight much possible, whispering pushing, fighting, desperate scuffle escape. "What this!" cried she, full pitch her voice, "has bedlam broke loose! smashed cups? I will break his head him, let tell that! Master Peter! hissed world misconduct; I shall certainly whip round room like whipping-top." At moment, Peter observed dining-room window, six feet ground, left wide open, instantly seizing opportunity, he threw single bound, ran laughing away. All boys immediately followed his example, disappeared road; which, Mrs. Crabtree leaned far window, scolded loudly, long remained sight, till her face became red, her voice perfectly hoarse. Meantime, little misses sat soberly empty table, talked whispers other, waiting till maids came take home, hurried away fast possible, hardly waiting say "good bye," intending ask supper home. During night, long Harry Laura scolded, whipped, put bed, heard different rooms, sobbing crying, hearts would break, Mrs. Crabtree grumbled scolded herself, saying she must her duty, make good children, though she flay alive first. When Lady Harriet returned home days afterwards, she heard account Harry Laura's misconduct Mrs. Crabtree, whole story terrible case them, poor grandmama became perfectly astonished shocked, even uncle David preparing angry; culprits appeared, Frank kindly stepped forward, begged might pardoned once, adding his power excuse Harry Laura, describing penitent become, severely already punished. Frank mentioned Harry told starving party, he related much humour drollery, Lady Harriet could help laughing; he saw victory gained, ran nursery two little prisoners. Uncle David shook his walking-stick them, made terrible face, entered; Harry jumped upon his knee joy seeing again, Laura forgot her distress, rushed Lady Harriet, folded her her arms, kissed her affectionately. Not word said day tea-party, next morning, Major Graham asked Harry, gravely, "if he read newspapers melancholy accounts several his little companions, ill confined bed ate much certain tea-party Saturday last. Poor Peter Grey given over, Charles Forrester, feared, may able eat another loaf bread fortnight!" "Oh! uncle David! makes ill whenever I think party!" said Harry, colouring perfectly scarlet; "that miserable evening life!" "I must say quite fair Mrs. Crabtree starve strange little boys girls, came visitors house, without knowing invited them," observed Lady Harriet. "Probably unlucky children never forget, long live, scanty supper dining-room." And turned exactly Lady Harriet predicted; though asked tea, proper time, next Saturday, Major Graham showered torrents sugar-plums table, children scrambled pick up, side-board almost broke afterwards weight buns, cakes, cheesecakes, biscuits, fruit, preserves, heaped upon other--yet, years afterwards, Peter Grey, whenever he ate particularly enormous dinner, always observed, he must make starved Harry Graham's; whenever one little boys girls happened meet Harry Laura, sure laugh say, "When going give us another "GRAND FEAST?" CHAPTER III. THE TERRIBLE FIRE. Fire rages fury wherever comes, If one spark dropped; Whole houses, cities, sometimes consumes, Where violence cannot stopped. One night, eight of the clock, Harry Laura playing nursery, building houses bricks, trying could raise highest tower without letting fall, suddenly startled hear every bell house ringing violently, servants seemed running stairs, distracted. "What matter!" cried Laura, turning round listening, Harry quietly took opportunity shake walls her castle till fell. "The house coming ears, Laura!" said Harry, enjoying his little bit mischief. "I like Andrew, now, five minutes, I might answer fifty bells, see happened. Uncle David must wanting coals, candles, tea, toast, soda water, once! What bustle everybody in! There! bells ringing again, worse ever! Something wonderful going on! be!" Presently Betty ran breathlessly room, saying Mrs. Crabtree ought come stairs immediately, Lady Harriet suddenly taken ill, and, till Doctor arrived, nobody knew do, she must give her advice assistance. Harry Laura felt excessively shocked hear alarming news, listened grave attention, Mrs. Crabtree told amazingly well ought behave her absence, trusted alone nursery, nobody keep order, see doing, especially now, grandmama taken ill, would require kept quiet. Harry sat his chair, might painted picture good boy nearly twenty minutes Mrs. Crabtree departed; Laura placed herself opposite him, trying follow excellent example, scarcely spoke whisper, wondering could matter grandmama, wishing once, see Mrs. Crabtree again, might hear she was. Any one observed Harry Laura time, would wondered see two quiet, excellent, respectable children, wished little boys girls made upon pattern; presently began think probably Lady Harriet ill, bells rung several minutes, Harry ventured look better amusement sitting still. At moment Laura unluckily perceived table near sat, pair Mrs. Crabtree's best scissors, she positively forbid touch. The long troublesome ringlets usual hanging her eyes teazing manner, she thought good opportunity might shorten little, inch two; without considering moment longer, she slipped upon tiptoe, frightened look, round table, picked scissors her hand, hastening towards looking-glass, she began snipping ends her hair. Laura much diverted see showering upon floor, she cut cut on, curls fell thicker faster, till last whole floor covered them, scarcely hair left upon her head. Harry went fits laughing he perceived ridiculous figure Laura made herself, he turned her round round see havoc she made, saying, "You give hair Mr. Mills upholsterer, stuff grandmama's arm-chair with! At rate, Laura, Mrs. Crabtree ever angry, she hardly pull hair head again! What sound sleep to-night, hard curl-papers torment you!" Harry told five hundred times, never touch candles, threatened twenty different punishments, he ever ventured so; now, he amused trying snuff one till he snuffed out. Then he lighted again, tried experiment more, teazing candle went out, purpose plague him, he felt quite provoked. Having lighted more, Harry prepared carry candlestick towards inner nursery, though afraid make smallest noise, case might taken him. Before he gone five steps, dropped extinguisher, followed snuffers great crash, Laura seemed busy cropping her ringlets, notice going on. All way along upon floor, Harry let fall perfect shower hot wax, spotted nursery carpet table he found candle next room, he disappeared, shut door, one might interfere he liked do. After he absent time, door hastily opened again, Laura felt surprised see Harry come back his face red stick sealing-wax, his large eyes staring wider ever stared before, look rueful consternation. "What matter!" exclaimed Laura terrified voice. "Has anything dreadful happened? Why look frightened surprised?" "Oh dear! oh dear! shall I do?" cried Harry, seemed scarcely know he spoke, he was. "I do not know do, Laura!" "What matter! tell once, Harry," said Laura, shaking apprehension. "Speak fast can!" "Will tell Mrs. Crabtree, grandmama, anybody else?" cried Harry, bursting tears. "I very, sorry, frightened! Laura! know, I took candle next room, merely play it." "Well! go on, Harry! go on! candle?" "I put bed single minute, see flame would look there,--well! know blazed away famously, bed clothes began burning too! Oh! terrible fire next room! never saw anything like it! shall do? If old Andrew come up, think he could put out? I shut door Mrs. Crabtree may see flames. Be sure, Laura, tell nobody Andrew." Laura became terrified way she saw poor Harry in, she opened door find real state affairs, oh! dreadful sight there! beds fire, bright red flames blazing roof room, fierce roaring noise, perfectly frightful hear. She screamed aloud terror alarming scene, Harry he could quiet her, even put his hand her mouth, her cries might heard. Laura struggled get loose, called louder louder, till last every maid house came racing stairs, three steps time, know matter. Immediately upon seeing flames, began screaming too, loud discordant way, sounded whole flight crows come passages. Never uproar heard house before, walls echoed general cry "Fire! fire! fire!" Up flew Mrs. Crabtree towards nursery like sky-rocket, scolding furiously, talking louder others put together, asking set house fire, Harry Laura scarcely knew whether frightened raging flames, raging Mrs. Crabtree; but, meantime, shrunk smallest possible size, hid behind door. During confusion, Old Andrew luckily remembered, that, morning, great washing laundry, large tubs full water standing, he called maids senses remaining, desiring assist carrying buckets, might emptied burning beds, extinguish flames possible. Every body hurry, elbowing way, extraordinary see old Andrew exerted himself, he fireman his life, Mrs. Marmalade, fat cook, could hardly carry herself stairs general, actively assisted bring great heavy tubs, pour like cascade upon burning curtains, till nursery-floor looked like duck pond. Meantime Harry Laura added confusion much could, busier anybody, stealing back-stairs whenever Mrs. Crabtree sight, filling little jugs water, brought up, fast possible, dashed upon flames, till last, feared, began feel quite amused bustle, almost sorry conflagration diminished. At one time, Laura nearly set her frock fire, she ventured near, Harry pulled her back, courageously advanced discharge shower his little jug, remaining stationary watch effect, till his face almost scorched. At last fire became less less, till went totally out, nursery furniture reduced perfect ruins, besides which, Betty her arm sadly burned confusion. Mrs. Marmalade's cap completely destroyed, Mrs. Crabtree's best gown large hole burned skirt, she never could wear again! After quiet, fire completely extinguished, Major Graham took Laura stairs Lady Harriet's dressing-room, she might tell whole particulars alarming accident happened nursery, nobody could guess caused sudden dreadful fire, seemed unexpected flash lightning. Lady Harriet felt terrified noise confusion, she bed, sitting arm-chair, supported pillows, Laura entered, sight whom, her well-cropped head, she made exclamation perfect amazement. "Why! earth that! Laura! dear child! become hair? Were curls burned fire? fright make grow bald? What meaning this?" Laura turned perfectly crimson shame distress, she felt convinced her great misconduct scissors curls, she taught occasions speak truth, would rather died told lie, even allowed person believe true, therefore she answered low, frightened voice, tears came her eyes, "My hair burned off, grandmama! but--but--" "Well, child! speak out!" said Lady Harriet, impatiently, "did hair-dresser come house rob you?" "Or like ladies Carthage gave long hair bows arrows?" asked Major Graham. "I never saw little fright life look now; tell us it?" "I quite naughty Harry!" answered Laura, bursting tears sobbing grief; "I cutting hair Mrs. Crabtree's scissors time he setting nursery fire!" "Did mortal ever hear two little torments!" exclaimed Major Graham, hardly able help laughing. "I wonder anybody else world mischievous children!" "It certainly strange, Harry never contrive three hours scrape!" said Lady Harriet gravely; "now Frank, contrary, never forgets I bid do. You might suppose he carried Mrs. Crabtree his pocket, remind constantly his duty; two boys world Frank!" "No," added Major Graham; "Harry set house fire, Frank set Thames fire!" When Laura saw uncle David put one his funny looks, he spoke way Lady Harriet, she almost forgot her former fright, became surprised observe her grandmama busy preparing she called coach-wheel, often given treat Harry herself particularly good. This delightful wheel manufactured taking whole round slice loaf, centre placed large tea-spoonful jelly, long spokes marmalade, jam, honey, made diverge tastefully every direction towards crust, Laura watched progress business great interest anxiety, wondering could hoped her grandmama really meant forgive her misconduct day. "That coach-wheel is, course, meant me!" said Major Graham, pretending hungry, looking slyly Laura; "It cannot possibly intended little hair-dresser here!" "Yes, is!" answered Lady Harriet, smiling. "I thoughts excusing Laura time, she always tells truth, without attempting conceal foolish thing she does. It long she hair cut again, I hope she may older wiser time, especially considering every looking-glass she sees six months make her feel ashamed herself. She certainly deserves reward prevented house to-night burned ground." "I glad think so, shilling burning pocket last minutes, I wished bestow Laura saved lives, she behaved still better, I might perhaps given her gold watch!" Laura busily employed eating her coach-wheel, trying fancy gold watch would looked like she might probably got uncle David, suddenly door burst open, Mrs. Crabtree hurried room, look surprise alarm, her face red poppy, her eye fixed hole her best gown, she spoke loud angrily, Laura almost trembled. "If please, lady! Master Harry be? I cannot find corner!--we searching house, stairs stairs, vain. Not garret closet ransacked, nobody guess become him!" "Did look chimney, Mrs. Crabtree?" asked Major Graham, laughing see excited she looked. "Indeed, Sir! joke," answered Mrs. Crabtree, sulkily; "I almost afraid Master Harry burned fire! The last time Betty saw him, he throwing jug water flames, one ever seen heard since! There great many ashes cinders lying room, and----" "Do think, sober seriousness, Mrs. Crabtree, Harry would melt away like wax doll, without asking body extinguish him?" said Major Graham, smiling. "No! no! little boys quite easily disposed of. I shall find Harry less five minutes, he ground." But uncle David quite mistaken expecting discover Harry easily, he searched searched vain. He looked every possible impossible place--the library, kitchen, garrets, laundry, drawing-room, without success,--he peeped tables, behind curtains, beds, beneath pillows, Mrs. Crabtree's bonnet-box,--he even opened tea-chest, looked window, case Harry tumbled over, nowhere could he found. "Not mouse stirring!" exclaimed Major Graham, beginning look exceedingly grave anxious. "This strange! The house-door locked, therefore, unless Harry made his escape key-hole, he must here! It unaccountable little pickle done himself!" When Major Graham chose exert his voice, loud trumpet, could heard half mile off; he called out, like thunder, top stairs bottom, saying, "Hollo, Harry! hollo! Come here, boy! Nobody shall hurt you! Harry! you!" Uncle David waited listen, still,--no answer could heard, sound house, except poor Laura bottom stairs, sobbing grief terror Harry lost, Mrs. Crabtree grumbling angrily herself, account large hole her best gown. By time Lady Harriet nearly fainted fatigue, she old, ill day; she grew worse worse, till everybody said she must go bed, try would possible fall asleep, assuring her Harry must soon found, nothing particular could happened him, person would seen it. "Indeed, lady! Master Harry like bad shilling sure come back," said Mrs. Crabtree, helping her undress, she continued talk whole time fire, showing her unfortunate gown, describing trouble she taken save house burned, always ending every sentence wish she could lay her hands Harry punish he deserved. "The truth is, I spoil indulge children much, lady!" added Mrs. Crabtree, self-satisfied tone voice. "I really blame often easy kind." "You nothing accuse respect," answered Lady Harriet, unable help smiling. "Your ladyship good say so. Major Graham fond young people, lucky one keep order. I shall make duty, lady, strict ever. Master Harry must made example time!" added Mrs. Crabtree, angrily glancing hole her gown. "I shall teach remember day longest hour he live!" "Harry forget how," answered Lady Harriet languidly. "Perhaps, Mrs. Crabtree, might well severe poor boy occasion. As old proverb says, 'there use pouring water drowned mouse.' Harry got sad fright his pains, events must find first, he punished. Where poor child hid?" "I would give sixpence find that, lady!" answered Mrs. Crabtree, helping Lady Harriet bed, she closed shutters, put candles, left room, angrily muttering, "Master Harry cares poker cares tongs, I shall teach another story soon." Lady Harriet feebly closed her eyes, quite exhausted, beginning feel pleasant, confused sensation people going sleep, noise made her suddenly start quite awake. She sat bed listen, could sure whether great noise distance, little noise room; waiting two three minutes, she sunk back upon pillows, tried forget it. Again, however, she distinctly heard something rustling bed curtains, opened her eyes see could matter, dark. Something seemed breathing near her, however, curtains shook worse before, till Lady Harriet became really alarmed. "It must surely cat room!" thought she, hastily pulling bell rope, till nearly came down. "That tiresome little animal make noise, I shall able sleep night!" The next minute Lady Harriet startled hear loud sob close beside her; everybody rushed stairs ask matter, brought candles search room, Harry! He lay doubled corner, crying his heart would break, yet still endeavouring seen; Harry always thought terrible disgrace cry, would concealed anywhere, rather observed weeping. Laura burst tears also, she saw red eyes pale cheeks Harry had; Mrs. Crabtree lost time pulling his place, quite impatient begin her scold, produce her tawse, though she received sad disappointment occasion, uncle David unexpectedly interfered get off. "Come now, Mrs. Crabtree," said he good-naturedly; "put tawse time; rather fond leather. Harry seems really sorry frightened, must merciful. That cataract tears he shedding now, would extinguished fire come time! Harry like culprit rope his neck; he shall executed. Let judge jury case; sentence dreadful one. Harry must sleep to-night burned nursery, covering burned blankets, large holes them, he may never forget "THE TERRIBLE FIRE!" CHAPTER IV. THE PRODIGIOUS CAKE. Yet joy That lifts steps, sparkles eyes; That talks laughs, runs, shouts, plays, And speaks looks, ways. Crabbe. Next day fire, Laura could think nothing she shilling uncle David given her; thousand plans came her head, many wants entered her thoughts, never occurred before; that, twenty shillings her hand instead one, would gone twenty different ways. Lady Harriet advised laid bye till Laura fully considered she would like best; reminding her truly, money lame coming, flies going away. "Many people get shilling, Laura," said her grandmama; "but difficulty keep it; know old proverb tells 'a fool his money soon parted.'" "Yes, Miss! give me, I shall take care shilling!" added Mrs. Crabtree, holding her hand Laura, fell her money disappeared capacious pocket, she would never see again. "Children use money! shilling burn hole purse, till spent foolish thing other. You losing thimble soon, mislaying gloves; things seem fly every direction, got legs wings soon belong you; shilling may replace lost." Mrs. Crabtree looked she would eat up; Laura grasped her treasure still tighter her hand, exclaiming, "No! no! mine! Uncle David never thought shilling taken care of! He meant whatever I liked it! Uncle David says he cannot endure saving children, he wishes money turned slates, little girls keep longer week." "I like that!" said Harry, eagerly; "it pleasant spend money, shopkeeper bows counter politely, asks I please want." "Older people like spending money, Master Harry, spend whether no; greatest pleasure keep it. For instance, Miss Laura, whatever she sees worth shilling shop, might she pleases; quite good her own. We shall look bazaar every morning, fix upon something she would like have, consider two three days." Laura thought plan unsatisfactory, she lost time getting her shilling changed two sixpences, one she immediately presented Harry, positively refused long time accept it, insisting Laura rather buy pretty plaything herself; she answered much pleasanter divide her fortune Harry, selfish, spend alone. "I sure, Harry," added she, "if money yours, would said thing, given half got me; let us say that, tell would best use make sixpence?" "You might buy fine red morocco purse saw shop window yesterday," observed Harry, looking serious anxious, consulted. "Do remember much wished it?" "But use purse, money keep it!" answered Laura, looking earnestly Harry advice. "Think something else." "Would like new doll?" "Yes; I nothing dress her with!" "Suppose buy pretty geranium red flower-pot gardener's!" "If would live week, I might tempted try; flowers always die me. They seem wither I much look them. Do remember pretty fuchsia I almost drowned first day grandmama gave me; forgot week afterwards water all. I good flower doctor." "Then buy gold watch once," said Harry, laughing; "or fine pony, saddle, ride on." "Now, Harry, pray quite earnest. You know I might well attempt buy moon gold watch; think something else." "It difficult make good use money," said Harry, pretending look exceedingly wise. "Do know, Laura, I found could twelve large ship biscuits saw baker's shop sixpence. Only think! could feed whole town, make present everybody house besides! I dare say Mrs. Crabtree might like one her tea. All maids would think treat. You could present one Frank, another old Andrew, would still left poor children cottage." "Oh! thing!" cried Laura, running room send Andrew basket, looking happy possible. Not long afterwards, Frank, returned school, standing nursery window, he suddenly called voice surprise amazement, "Come here, Harry! look old Andrew! he carrying something tied towel, large his head! be?" "That me! biscuits!" said Laura, running receive parcel, though she heard Frank laughing, Harry told them, she care, brought her whole collection triumphantly nursery. "Oh fancy! perfect!" cried Harry, opening bundle; "this good fun!" "Here provisions siege!" added Frank. "You least got enough money, Laura!" "Take one yourself, Frank!" said she, reaching largest, then, rest tied her apron, Laura proceeded stairs, making presents every person she met, till her whole store finished; she felt quite satisfied happy everybody seemed pleased returned many thanks, except Mrs. Crabtree, said she teeth eat hard things, fit sailors going America West Indies. "You bought pound sugar, Miss Laura, might present worth giving." "You sweet already, Mrs. Crabtree!" said Frank, laughing. "I shall send sugar-cane West Indies, beat Harry Laura with, whole barrel sugar yourself, estate." "None nonsense, Master Frank! Get nursery moment! You estate indeed! You place put foot upon soon except topmast man-of-war, bad boys ship sent." "Perhaps, captain, I may escape, dining officers sometimes! I mean send home fine new India shawl, Mrs. Crabtree, moment I arrive Madras, china tea-cups Canton." "Fiddlesticks nonsense!" said Mrs. Crabtree, sometimes enjoyed little jesting Frank. "Keep rattle-traps till rich nabob, come home look Mrs. Frank,--a fine wife she be! Ladies get fortunes India covered gold chains, gold muslins, scarlet shawls. She eat nothing curry rice, never put her foot ground except step her carriage." "I hope gipsey, tell fortunes!" cried Harry, laughing; "Frank would die rather take wife." "Or, least, I would rather tooth drawn it," added Frank, smiling. "Perhaps I may prefer marry one old wives chimney-tops; serious say I would rather die, nobody knows awful die, till appointed day comes." "Very true proper, Master Frank," replied Mrs. Crabtree; "you speak like printed book sometimes, deserve good wife." "Then I shall return home day chests gold, let choose one me, quiet good-natured yourself, Mrs. Crabtree," said Frank, taking his books hastening school, running way, he rather late, Mr. Lexicon, master, promised grand prize boy came punctually his lessons, everybody declared Frank sure gain, he never absent right moment. Major Graham often tried teaze Frank, calling "the Professor,"--asking questions impossible answer, pretending quite shocked his ignorance; one ever saw young scholar put temper tricks trials, he always laughed heartily one else, joke. "Now show me, Frank," said uncle David, one morning, "how advance three steps backwards?" "That quite impossible, unless turn crab." "Tell me, then, principal town Caffraria?" "Is town there? I recollect it." "Then much worse!--how ever get life without knowing chief town Caffraria! I quite ashamed ignorance. Now let us try little arithmetic! Open door understanding tell me, wheat six shillings bushel, price penny loaf. Take slate calculate that." "Yes, uncle David, find out, gooseberries two shillings pint, price threepenny tart. You remind old nursery song-- 'The man wilderness asked me, How many strawberries grew sea; I answered him, I thought good, As many red herrings grew wood.'" Some days Laura distributed biscuits, she became sorry squandered her shilling, without attending Lady Harriet's good advice, keeping carefully her pocket least week, see would happen. A pleasant way using money fell her way, she foolish spendthrift, her pockets empty, she wished full. Harry came morning breakfast nursery, looking great bustle, whispering Laura, "What pity sixpence gone! Mrs. Crabtree says, 'we cannot eat cake it!'" "No!" answered Laura, seriously she never thought before, "but particularly wish money back to-day?" "Because nice, funny thing done morning. You I asked join party, I afraid cannot afford it! All little cousins companions intend going Mr. Harwood, tutor, twelve of the clock, climb top Arthur's Seat, dine dance. There twenty boys girls party, every body carry basket filled provisions dinner, either cakes, fruit, biscuits, eat great rock top hill. Now grandmama says ought money enough supply necessary, might gone, one admitted least sixpence buy something." "Oh! provoking!" said Laura, sadly, "I wonder shall learn always follow grandmama's advice, sure turn best end. I never take way without sorry afterwards, I deserve disappointed remain home; but, Harry, sixpence still safe, pray join delightful party, tell afterwards." "If could take us both, I happy, I go without you, Laura, good me, gave present. No, no! I wish could like poor madman grandmama mentioned, planted sixpences ground might grow shillings." "Pray! two looking solemn about?" asked Frank, hurrying room, moment, his way school. "Are talking mischief done already, mischief intending soon?" "Neither one other," answered Laura. "But, oh! Frank, I sure sorry us, tell sad disappointment!" She related whole story party Arthur's Seat, mentioning Mr. Harwood kindly offered take charge Harry herself, her little fortune foolishly squandered, she could go, Harry said would impossible enjoy fun without her, though Lady Harriet given leave party. All time Laura spoke, Frank stood, his hands his pockets, he seemed evidently searching something, whole history told, he said Harry, "Let see poor little sixpence yours! I clever conjuror, could perhaps turn shilling!" "Nonsense, Frank!" said Laura, laughing; "you might well turn Harry uncle David!" "Well! shall see!" answered Frank, taking sixpence. "I put money box!--rattle well!--once! twice! thrice!--there, peep in!--now shilling! I told so!" Frank ran joyously room, much amused joke, he put one his shillings box Harry Laura, excessively surprised first, felt really ashamed take kind present Frank, he seldom money his own; knew generous he was, he often repeated excellent maxim, "It blessed give receive." After minutes, remembered nothing could prevent going Mr. Harwood Arthur's Seat, put Laura state ecstacy, she danced round room joy, Harry jumped upon tables chairs, tumbled head heels, called Betty come immediately might get ready. When Mrs. Crabtree heard uproar, she hastened also room, asking happened riot, she became angry indeed, hear Harry Laura got leave join grand expedition. "You spoiling clothes, getting heat! I wonder her ladyship allows this! How much better would taking quiet walk gardens! I shall really speak Lady Harriet it! The air must cold top great mountains! I sure colds month Tom-foolery." "Oh no, Mrs. Crabtree! I promise catch cold!" cried Harry, eagerly; "and, besides, scarcely prevent going now, grandmama set her long airing carriage, nobody ask keeping us home, except uncle David!" Mrs. Crabtree knew experience, Major Graham hopeless case, he always took part children, liked nothing much old young "a ploy;" she grumbled herself, her eyes looked sharp pair scissors rage. "You come back, turned scare-crows, nice clean clothes tatters," said she, angrily; "but much speck upon best new jacket trowsers, I shall know reason why." "What comfort would be, things world 'new clothes,' I always much happier old ones," said Harry. "People shops sell clothes never either dirty tear!" "You ought dressed fur, like Robinson Crusoe, sent naked, like little savages," said Mrs. Crabtree, "or painted black blue like wild old Britons lived long ago!" "I black blue sometimes, without painted," said Harry, escaping door. "Good-bye, Mrs. Crabtree! I hope die weariness without us! On return shall tell delightful adventures." About half hour afterwards, Harry Laura seen hurrying pastry-cook, Mrs. Weddell's shop, bearing little covered baskets hands, nobody could guess them. They whispered laughed together merry faces, looking pictures happiness, running along fast could join noisy party cousins companions, almost fearing Mr. Harwood might set without them. Frank often called "Mr. Punctuality," he particular his scholars good time occasions; certainly Mr. Harwood carried his watch his hand his pocket, habit constantly looking see nobody arrived late. Mail-coaches steamboats could hardly keep time better, hour named, last words Harry heard he invited were, "Remember! sharp twelve." The great clock St. Andrew's Church busy striking hour, every little clock town saying thing, Mr. Harwood himself, his watch his hand, opened door, walked out, followed dozen merry-faced boys girls, speaking once, vociferating louder clocks, thought everybody grown deaf. "I shall reach top Arthur's Seat first," said Peter Grey. "All follow me, I know shortest way. It hop, step, jump!" "Rather long step!" cried Robert Fordyce. "But I could lead much better way, though I shall show nobody myself." "We must certainly drink water St. Anthony's Well," observed Laura; "because whatever one wishes he tastes it, sure happen immediately." "Then I shall wish person may give new doll," said Mary Forrester. "My old one fit lady's maid fine new doll." "I ninety-nine minds wish for," exclaimed Harry; "we must take care like foolish old woman fairy tale, got yard black pudding." "I shall ask piebald pony, whip, saddle, bridle!" cried Peter Grey; "and week's holidays,--and new watch,--and spade,--and box French plums,--and first top Arthur's Seat,--and--and--" "Stop, Peter!--stop! one wish St. Anthony's Well," interrupted Mr. Harwood. "If ask more, lose all." "That hard, I want everything," replied Peter. "What wishing for, Sir?" "What shall I ask for?" said Mr. Harwood, reflecting himself. "I want world?" "O yes, Sir! must wish something!" cried whole party, eagerly. "Do invent something ask, Mr. Harwood!" "Then I wish may behave well till reach top Arthur's Seat, come safely again." "You may sure already!" said Peter, laughing. "I set good example companions, never behave ill I present,--no! even accident! When Dr. Algebra examined class to-day, he asked Mr. Lexicon, 'What become best boy school morning?' answer was, 'Of course mean Peter Grey! He gone top Arthur's Seat excellent man, Mr. Harwood!'" "Indeed!--and pray, Master Peter, bird whispered story ear, seeing happened since left home!--but people praised nobody else, often take praising themselves!" "Who knows better!--and Harry Graham, ditto myself,--so steady he might fit drill whole regiment. We shall lead party quite safely hill, again, without ladders." "And without wings," added Harry, laughing; "but draw water well with?--here neither buckets, tumblers, glasses!" "I could lend thimble!" said Laura, searching her pocket. "That hold enough water one wish, every person may loan turn." "This first time thimble use anybody!" said Harry, slyly; "but I dare say worn holes much sewing, therefore make famous little magical cup St. Anthony's Well. You know fairies dance moonlight, lay table-cloth upon mushroom, sit round it, merry, I never heard use drinking cup." Harry proceeded briskly along well, singing he went, song taught uncle David, beginning, I wish I brewer's horse, Five quarters year, I would place head tail, And drink beer. Before long whole party seated circle grass round St. Anthony's Well, stranger chanced pass might supposed, noise merriment, Saint filled his well champagne punch occasion, everybody seemed perfectly tipsy happiness. Mr. Harwood laughed prodigiously jokes, made his own, none best, though caused laughter, boys thought surprising grave great man make joke all. When Mary Forrester drank her thimbleful water, wished new doll, Peter Harry privately cut face upon red-cheeked apple, making eyes, nose, mouth, which, hastily dressed pocket handkerchiefs, gave her present fairies, looked like she asked for, laugh followed loud long. Afterwards Peter swallowed his draught, calling loudly piebald pony, Harry his white trowsers, dark jacket, went upon all-fours, let Peter mount his back. It difficult, however, get Peter again, he enjoyed fun excessively, stuck his seat like Sinbad's old man sea, till last Harry rolled round his back, tumbling Peter head heels St. Anthony's Well, upon seeing which, Mr. Harwood rose, saying, he certainly lost his wish, behaved ill, met accident already. Harry laughingly proposed Peter carefully hung upon tree dry, till came again; mischievous boy ran fast, he almost sight moment, saying, "Now top Arthur's Seat, I shall grow dry fatigue climbing." The boys girls immediately scattered hill, getting best way could, trying could scramble fastest, grass quite short, slippery ice, therefore became every moment difficult stand, still difficult climb. The whole party began sliding whether liked not, staggered tried grasp turf, nothing hold, occasionally shower stones gravel came Peter, pretended fell accident. "Oh, Harry!" cried Laura, panting breath, she looked frightened fatigued, "If party pleasure, I think sometimes quite happy gardens! People must miserable home, come amused! I wish cats, goats, thing stand upon hill without feeling giddy." "I think good fun!" answered Harry, gasping trying tumble twentieth time; "you would like perhaps back nursery Mrs. Crabtree." "No! no! I quite bad that! But Harry! ever really expect reach top? I never shall; I mean sit quietly here, wait till return." "I better plan that, Laura! shall sit upon highest point Arthur's Seat well anybody, either us hour older! Let go first, I get famously, must never look behind, keep tight hold jacket, every step I advance pull also." Laura delighted plan, succeeded perfectly well, ascended rather slowly, exceedingly fatiguing Harry, looked quite happy time use, he always felt glad he could thing anybody, particularly either Laura Frank. Now, whole party last safely assembled highest point Arthur's Seat, boys threw caps air, gave three tremendous cheers, frightened crows heads, sent flock sheep scampering mountain side. After that, planted Mr. Harwood's walking-stick ground, staff, Harry tore blue silk handkerchief Mrs. Crabtree tied his neck, without caring whether he caught cold not, he fastened pole flag, quite delighted see waved wind triumphantly, looking like sailors put take possession desert island. "Now, business!" said Mr. Harwood, sitting rock, uncovering prodigious cake, nearly large cheese, he taken trouble carry, great difficulty, hill. "I suppose nobody hungry long walk! Let us see baskets contain!" Not moment lost seating grass, stores displayed, amidst shouts laughter applause generally followed whatever came forth. Sandwiches, or, Peter Grey called them, "savages;" gingerbread, cakes, fruit, appeared turn. Robert Fordyce brought dozen hard-boiled eggs, dyed different colours, blue, green, pink, yellow, one white. Edmund Ashford produced collection sour-looking apples, Charles Forrester showed number little gooseberry tarts, became time Peter's basket opened, contained nothing except knife fork cut whatever his companions would give him! "Peter! Peter! shabby fellow!" said Charles Forrester, reaching one his tarts, "you put tread-mill sturdy beggar!" "Or thrown top precipice," added Harry, giving cake. "I wonder look us face, Peter!" "I heard," said Mr. Harwood, "that stone shown Ireland, called 'the stone Blarney,' whoever kisses it, never afterwards ashamed thing he does. Our friend Peter probably passed way lately!" "At rate, I likely starved death amongst all!" answered impudent boy, demolishing every thing he could get; believed Peter ate, memorable occasion, three times person, party offered something, he never heard say, "No!" "I could swallow Arthur's Seat turned plum-pudding," said he, pocketing buns, apples, eggs, walnuts, biscuits, almonds, till his coat stuck round like balloon. "Has one thing spare?" "Did ever hear," said Mr. Harwood, "that pigeon eats weight food every day? Now, I sure, I know one boy world, Peter, could much." "What done prodigious cake carried here, Mr. Harwood?" answered Peter, casting devouring eye upon it; "the crust seems hard rhinoceros' skin, I dare say good. One could sure though, without tasting it! I hope going take trouble carrying heavy load back again?" "How polite become sudden, Peter!" said Laura, laughing. "I sorry attempt carrying cake bottom hill, would roll down, shortest way, together." "I over-anxious try either," observed Charles Forrester, shaking his head. "Even Peter, though his mouth constantly ajar, would find cake rather heavy carry, either inside outside passenger." "I scarcely lift all!" continued Laura, Mr. Harwood tied towel; "what done?" "Here best plan!" cried Harry, suddenly seizing prodigious cake; body could hinder him, he gave tremendous push steepest part Arthur's Seat, rolled like wheel, stones precipices, jumping hopping along wonderful rapidity, amidst cheers laughter children, till last reached bottom hill, general clapping hands ensued. "Now race!" cried Harry, becoming eager. "The first boy girl reaches cake shall himself!" Mr. Harwood tried his might stop commotion, called must go quietly bank, Harry right give away cake, make break legs arms racing hill: he might well spoken east wind, asked blow. The whole party dispersed, like hive bees upset; moment full career cake. Some boys tried roll down, hoping get quickly. Others endeavoured slide, several attempted run, fell; many might tumblers Sadler's Wells, tumbled cleverly. Peter Grey's hat blown away, he stop catch it. Charlie Hume lost his shoe, Robert Fordyce sprained his ancle, every one girls tore her frock. It frightful scene; devastation bonnets jackets never known before; Mr. Harwood looked like General defeated army, calling till he became hoarse, running till he breath, vainly trying thus stop confusion, bring stragglers back better order. Meantime, Harry Peter far rest, though Edward Ashford following hard desperate haste, he still hoped overtake steps. Suddenly, however, loud cry distress heard over-head; Harry looked up, he saw alarming sight, he could scarcely believe his eyes, almost screamed fright gave him, he seemed forget moment, race, Peter Grey, prodigious cake. Laura anxious trouble Harry taking care her coming bank again; she saw fun cake, he perfectly forgot she accustomed every day scramble hills, would required help. After looking every side descent, thinking appeared steeper another, made her equally giddy, Laura determined venture part hill seemed rather less precipitous rest; completely cheated her, difficult dangerous part Arthur's Seat. The slope became steeper steeper every step; Laura always tried hope her path might grow better, till last she reached place impossible stop herself. Down she went, down! down! whether she would not, screaming sliding long slippery bank, till she reached edge dangerous precipice, appeared higher side room. Laura grappled hold stones grass, calling loudly help, scarcely able keep falling deep ravine, would probably killed her. Her screams echoed hill, Harry seeing her frightful situation, clambered bank faster lamplighter, immediately flew Laura's assistance, really hanging chasm, quite unable help herself. At last he reached place poor Laura lay, seized hold her frock; time seemed equal chance whether she dragged hole, he pulled her away it. Luckily, however, great effort, Harry succeeded delivering Laura, he placed upon secure situation, then, waited patiently till she recovered fright, he led her carefully kindly bottom Arthur's Seat. Now, boys already got there, violent dispute going first reached cake. Peter Grey pushed Edward Ashford, caught hold Robert Fordyce, three rolled bottom together, nobody could tell race; Mr. Harwood laboured vain convince cake belonged neither one other, his property. They laughed Harry distanced, arriving last; Mr. Harwood watched coming down, pleased observe carefully he attended Laura, though still, annoyed riot confusion Harry occasioned, he determined appear exceedingly angry, put terrible voice, saying, "Hollo! young gentleman! shall I beginning uproar? As old proverb says, 'one fool makes many.' How dare roll fine cake hill way, send everybody rolling it? Look face, say ashamed yourself!" Harry looked Mr. Harwood--and Mr. Harwood looked Harry. They tried seem grave serious, somehow Harry's eyes glittered brightly, two little dimples might seen his cheeks. Mr. Harwood also his eye-brows gathered terrible frown, still his eyes likewise sparkling, his mouth seemed pursed comical manner. After staring several minutes, Mr. Harwood Harry burst prodigious fit laughing, nobody could tell began first laughed longest. "Master Graham! must send new frock every little girl party, suit clothes boys, caused destroyed. I really meant punish severely beginning riot, something made change mind. In almost every moment lives, either act amiably unamiably, I observed treat Miss Laura kindly properly morning, I shall say another word "THE PRODIGIOUS CAKE." CHAPTER V. THE LAST CLEAN FROCK. "For," said she, spite grandmama taught her, "I am really remarkably fond water." * * * * * She splashed, she dashed, she turned herself round, And heartily wished herself safe ground. Once upon time Harry Laura got many scrapes, seemed really end misconduct. They generally forgot learn lessons--often tore books--drew pictures slates, instead calculating sums--and made pages copy-books boats; besides which, Mrs. Crabtree caught one day, party officers dined Lady Harriet's, two captain's sword-belts buckled round waists, cocked hats upon heads, beat crown gentleman's hat walking-stick, sound like drum. Still seemed impossible make uncle David feel sufficiently angry them, though Mrs. Crabtree she could put passion, telling worst; he made fifty excuses a-minute, he naughty person himself, instead Harry Laura, he said seemed exceedingly penitent he explained delinquencies, ready tell upon themselves, take blame whatever mischief might done, he determined shut his eyes say nothing, unless something purposely wrong. One night, Mrs. Crabtree gone out, Major Graham felt quite surprised his return home late dinner party, find Laura Harry still bed. They sitting his library he entered, looking tired miserable he could imagine happened; Harry lost time confessing he Laura feared done dreadful mischief, could sleep without asking pardon, mentioning whose fault was, maids might unjustly blamed. "Well, little imps mischief! I scold now?" asked uncle David, looking particularly angry. "Is something I shall obliged take trouble punishing for? We ought live Highlands, whole forests birch ready use? Why ears like bell-rope, Harry? seem made pulled. Now, go story. What matter?" "We playing room, uncle David, Laura lost her ball, she crept big table one large leg. There brass button below, trying would come off, sudden, table fell quite one side, see now, tumbling prodigious books tin boxes floor! I cannot think fine new table could easily broken; whenever even look anything, seems break!" "Yes, Harry! You remind Meddlesome Matty nursery rhymes, "Sometimes she would lift teapot lid To peep it, Or tilt kettle, But turn back minute. In vain told her touch, Her trick meddling grew much." You scarcely left poor table leg stand upon! How I ever get mended?" "Perhaps carpenter could to-morrow!" "Or, perhaps uncle David could moment," said Major Graham, raising fallen side sudden jerk, Harry Laura heard sound table like locking door, whole affair rectified. "Did I ever--!" exclaimed Harry, staring astonishment, "so suffered fright nothing, table really broken! I shall always run you, uncle David, scrape, sure get us off." "Do reckon certainly that, Master Harry; easier get one get it, day; I seriously angry sort scrapes Laura get into, would willingly deliberately wrong. If children commit mean action, get passion, quarrel other, omit saying prayers reading Bibles, tell lie, take belong them, might seen extremely angry I could be; continue merely thoughtless forgetful, I mean patience little longer turning cross old uncle pair tawse." Harry sprung upon uncle David's knee, quite delighted hear speak kindly, Laura soon installed her usual place also, listening said, laughing his jokes. "As Mrs. Crabtree says," continued Major Graham, "'we cannot put old head young shoulders;' would certainly look odd could." So uncle David took his pencil, drew funny picture cross old wrinkled face upon young shoulders, like Laura's, laughed together five minutes, he sent children bed, quite merry cheerful. A long time elapsed afterwards without anything going wrong; quite pleasant see learning lessons, attention rules, obedience Mrs. Crabtree, went nursery several weeks. At last, one day, Lady Harriet Major Graham preparing set journey, pay short visit Holiday House, Laura Harry observed great deal whispering talking corner room, could exactly discover about, till Major Graham said earnestly, "I think might surely take Laura us." "Yes," answered Lady Harriet, "both children invited, behaving wonderfully well late, Lord Rockville dislike noise, I dare venture take one time. Poor Laura severe cough, she may recovered change air. As Harry, he quite well, therefore he stay home." Now, Harry thought hard he left home, merely he felt quite well, he immediately wished ill indeed, he might chance going Holiday House; he exactly know set it. At events, Harry determined catch cold like Laura's, without delay. He would not, whole world pretended suffer cough he really none, uncle David often explained making one believe un-truth telling lie; he thought might harm really getting terrible cold, nothing could possibly cure except change air, trip Holiday House Laura. Accordingly Harry tried remember every thing Mrs. Crabtree forbid "for fear catching cold." He sprinkled water his shirt collar morning dressing, might damp; he ran violently stairs put heat, he sat open window door till he felt perfectly chilled; going bed night, he washed his hair cold water without drying it. Still, vain! Harry formerly caught cold hundred times he want one; now, thing love money. Nothing seemed give slightest attempt cough; day last arrived Lady Harriet begin her journey, Harry still felt provokingly well. Not much finger ached, his cheeks blooming roses, his voice clear bell, uncle David accidentally said morning, "How do?" Harry obliged, much his will, answer, "Quite well, I thank you!" In meantime, Laura would felt happy Harry could gone her; even was, impatient happy day arrive, she hurried bed hour earlier usual night before, make time setting appear nearer; she could scarcely sleep eat thinking Holiday House, planning done there. "It pleasant see joyous face," said Major Graham. "I almost envy you, Laura, happy." "Oh! I quite envy myself! I shall write long letter every day poor Harry, telling news, adventures." "Nonsense! Miss Laura! wait till come home," said Mrs. Crabtree. "Who think going pay postage many foolish letters?" "I shall!" answered Harry. "I got sixpence, two pence, half penny, I shall buy every one Laura's letters postman, write her answer immediately afterwards. She like hear, Mrs. Crabtree, kind going be, I left here. Perhaps play nine pins me, Laura lend her skipping rope." "You might well offer uncle David hobby-horse," said Frank, laughingly, throwing his satchel his shoulders. "No, Harry! shall belong now. Grandmama says may go every day play-ground, school-boys assemble, plenty fun till Laura comes back. We shall jump moon every morning, joy." Harry brightened amazingly, thinking he never heard good news before, grand piece promotion play real big school-boys; he became quite reconciled Laura's going away short time without him; hour came taking leave, instead tears she would either side, would difficult say, kissed said joyous good-bye, face looked delighted. All Laura's clothes packed night before, large chaise seat, put carriage along herself, every thing seemed ready departure, Lady Harriet's maid suddenly taken ill, quite unfit travelling; therefore she left behind, doctor sent attend her; Lady Harriet said she would trust maids Holiday House, waiting upon herself Laura. It seldom happy face seen world, Laura wore whole journey. It perfectly sparkled glittered delight, she constantly broad grin laughing, Major Graham said he feared her mouth would grow inch wider occasion. "You tire sitting long idle! It pity think bringing lesson-books carriage amuse you, Laura," said Major, slyly. "A piece needle-work might beguiled way. I knew industrious lady made ball dress herself carriage journey." "How stupid her miss seeing pretty trees, cottages, farm-houses! I like watch little curly-headed, dirty children, playing road, brown faces, hair bleached white sun; women hanging clothes hedges dry; blacksmith shoeing horses, ducks swimming gutters, pigs thrusting noses sty, old women knitting stockings, workmen sitting wall eat dinners! It looks pretty, pleasant!" "What picture rural felicity! You ought poet painter, Laura!" "But I believe poets always call miserable world: I think happiest place I ever in, uncle David! Such fun holidays! I go wild altogether, Mrs. Crabtree rather cross sometimes." "Or cross always," thought Major Graham. "But are, Laura, near journey's end. Allow introduce Holiday House! Why, staring like dog looking piece cold beef! My dear girl, open eyes wide, never able shut again!" Holiday House one prodigious places, grand pleasant, garden mile one direction, farm mile another, drawing-room mile dining-room; cheerful modern mansion, rooms enough hold many people one could desire see once, comfortably furnished. A lively, dashing river, streamed past windows; small park, sprinkled sheep, shaded fine trees, surrounded house; beyond beautiful gardens filled superabundance gayest sweetest common flowers. Roses, carnations, wall flowers, holly-hocks, dahlias, lilies, violets, assembled crowds, Laura might plucked nosegays day, without making visible difference; she also made free gooseberry bushes cherry-trees, leave gather, she pleased, she could eat. Every morning, Laura entered breakfast-room cheeks like roses she carried, bringing little bouquets ladies, she started bed early, order gather; her great delight see worn admired forenoon, she complimented taste selected arranged. She filled every ornamental jar, basin, tea-cup drawing-room, groups roses, would terror gardener one Holiday House, liked see his flowers much admired, keeping horticultural show. Laura's chief delight, however, dairy, seemed beautiful thing she ever beheld, built rough transparent spar, looked exactly like crystal, reminded her ice palace built Empress Russia. The windows painted glass; walls shelves Dutch tiles, centre rose beautiful jet d'eau clear bright water. Laura thought looked like something built fairies; within she saw substantial room, floor tables completely covered cheeses, looked like old Mosaic pavement. Here good-natured dairy-maid showed Laura make cheese, afterwards manufactured small one size soup plate, entirely young lady herself, she promised take home her visit over; little churn also filled full cream, Laura one morning churned butter, breakfasted upon, first practised printing variety shapes. It altered twenty times swan cow, cow rose, rose back swan again, she could persuaded leave her amusement. Laura continued become delighted Holiday House; she one day skipped Lady Harriet's room, saying, "Oh! I happy! I scarcely know much happiness. How delightful would stay life, never go bed, say lessons long I live!" "What useless, stupid girl would soon become," observed Lady Harriet. "Do think, Laura, lessons invented purpose torment little children?" "No, grandmama; exactly! They use also keep us quiet." "Come here, little madam, listen me. I shall soon old, Laura, able read Bible, even spectacles; for, Scriptures told us, affecting description old age, I read yesterday, 'the keepers house shall tremble, grinders cease few, look windows darkened:' think I do, Bible best comfort, I shall need every day, tell eternal world I going, shew way." "Grandmama! promised long ago let attend grow old blind! I shall careful, very--very--very kind. I almost wish old blind now, let feel much I love you, anxious I good always me. We shall read Bible together every morning, often afterwards please." "Thank you, dear child! must take trouble learning read well, shall sadly puzzled difficult words. A friend mine nobody could read her she ill, maid, bargained she might leave every word one syllable long, hard her; could hardly help laughing nonsense sometimes made; I hope manage better." "O certainly, grandmama! I spell chrononhotonthologos, five-cornered words 'Reading Made Easy,' already." "Besides that, dear Laura! unless learn look bills, I may sadly cheated servants shop-keepers. You must positively study find many cherries make five." "Ah! grandmama! nobody knows better I do, two two make four. I shall soon quite able keep accounts." "Very well! yet heard half trouble I mean give you. I remarkably fond music, shall probably last obliged hire every old fiddler he passes street, giving sixpence order enjoy favourite tunes." "No, grandmama! shall hear me. I play Malbrook, Auld Robin Grey, already; Frank says I practise two hours every day ten years, I shall become tolerable player, fit uncle David hear, without disagreeable." "Then seven thousand hours musical lessons yet endure, Laura! There many things still greater importance learn also, wish better musical snuff-box. For instance, visitors come see me, often France Italy; perhaps mind sitting room deaf dumb, gazing foreigners, gaze you, without understanding syllable say, causing feel strange uncomfortable long remain house." "No! I would world seem unkind uncivil. Pray, let learn plenty languages." "Very well! study geography, ridiculous blunders falling into! asking Italians native town Madrid, Americans born Petersburgh. You fancying travellers go steam-boats Moscow, travel day Paris, Stockholm Naples. How ashamed I mistakes!" "And I, grandmama, still you; would quite disgrace." "Do remember, Laura, uncle David laughing, he last went live Leamington, poor Mrs. Marmalade coming stairs say, she wish troublesome, feel greatly obliged he would call Portsmouth occasionally see her son Thomas. And Captain Armylist's regiment ordered last winter village Bathgate near this, he told march course morning, way Bagdad." "Yes, grandmama! Mrs. Crabtree said weeks ago, her brother went Van Dieman's Land, she thought he would course passing, take look Jerusalem; Frank amused lately hear Peter Grey maintain, Gulliver great man Columbus, he discovered Liliput!" "Quite like him! I heard Peter ask one day lately, side Bonaparte battle Leipsic? We must include little history I think, Laura, list studies, fancy Lord Nelson fought battle Blenheim, Henry VIII. cut Queen Mary's head." "Not quite bad that, grandmama! I seem known Lord Nelson Queen Mary, ever since I baby long frocks! You shewn me, however, would foolish feel anxious lessons, especially make fit companion last." "Yes, Laura! me, many whose conversation entertain improve books. The delightful accomplishment young person cultivate, conversing agreeably; less attended education other. You cannot take harp piano you, minds tongues always portable, accompany us wherever go. If wish loved others, good associates, well entertain them, take every opportunity conversing either amiable agreeable; attending opinions, also endeavouring gain habit expressing thoughts ease fluency; rest assured, gift conversation rightly exercised, desirable all, teaching greater influence leading people think act aright, incidental remarks enlightened Christian, freely unaffectedly talking his intimate friends." "Well, grandmama! moral is, I shall become busier body ever before, get home; meantime, I may take good dose idleness Holiday House, prepare settling hard labour afterwards," said Laura, hastily tying her bonnet. "I wonder I shall ever merry happy again!" Most unfortunately, time Laura's visit Holiday House, she been, usual, extremely heedless, taking care whatever her clothes; consequently her blue merino frock cruelly torn; her green silk dress became frightfully soiled; four white frocks utterly ruined; her Swiss muslin seemed perfect object, her pink gingham torn discoloured. Regularly every evening Lady Harriet told her take better care, she would bankrupt frocks altogether; whatever her grandmama said subject, moment she sight, went mind, till another dress shared deplorable fate. At last, one morning, soon Laura got up, Lady Harriet gravely led her towards large table ill-used frocks laid row; dismal sight were! Such collection stains fractures probably never seen before! A beggar would scarcely thanked her her blue merino; green silk frock looked like tattered cover worn-out umbrella. "Laura," said Lady Harriet, "in Switzerland lady's wardrobe descends many generations; nobody envy successor! One might fancy wild beast torn pieces every day! I wonder old clothesman would give whole baggage! It fit used rags paper manufactory!" Poor Laura's face became perfectly pink she saw destruction short time occasioned: she looked one tattered garment another, melancholy silence, thinking lately fresh beautiful; vestige former splendour remained. At last her grandmama broke awful silence, saying, "My dear girl! I warned often lately home, frocks could washed mended soon spoiled; without considering have, every day, destroyed several, maid finds, examining drawers, one clean frock remaining!" Laura looked gravely last clean frock, wondered much her grandmama would say next. "I wish make prisoner home fine weather, yet five minutes leaving house, will, course, become unfit seen, I much regret, number fine people coming dinner, would like see. The great General Courteney, his Aide-de-Camps, intend way review, besides many officers ladies know papa well, wish see little grand-daughter; I would account allow appear them, looking like perfect tatterdemalion, often do. They would suppose drawn backwards hedge! Now plan is, shall wear old pink gingham romping morning garden, dress last clean frock dinner; remember keep sight till then. Remain within garden walls, none company walking there, sure avoid terrace shrubberies till made tidy, I shall angry mortified papa's friends see first time looking like rag-fair." Laura promised remember her grandmama's injunctions, remain invisible morning; she set garden, singing skipping joy, she ran towards her pleasant hiding-place, planning twenty ways day might delightfully spent alone. Before long she strung long necklace daisies--she put many bright leaves book dry--she made large ball cowslips toss air--she watered hyacinths, watering-pot, till nearly washed away--she plucked roses could possibly carried, eat many gooseberries cherries convenient swallow,--but still several hours remaining enjoyed, nothing particular, Laura could think of, do. Meantime, miserable pink frock torn worse ever, seemed made nothing holes, every gooseberry-bush garden got share it. Laura wished pink gingham frocks never invented, wondered nothing stronger could made! Having become perfectly tired garden, she wished herself anywhere else world, thought she better off, confined way within four walls, canary bird cage. "I like much go, five minutes, terrace!" said she herself. "How much pleasanter this. Grandmama care I went, provided nobody saw me! I may least take peep see one there!" Laura cautiously opened garden-door, put her head out, intending look moment, moment grew longer longer, till stretched ten minutes. "What crowds fine people walking terrace!" thought she. "It looks gay fair! Who officer red coat, cocked hat white feathers. Probably General Courteney paying attention Lady Rockville. There lady blue cloak blue flowers! pretty! Everybody exceedingly smart! I see little boys too! Grandmama never told children coming! I wonder old are, play evening! It would amusing venture little nearer, get better glimpse all!" If Laura's wishes pointed one way her duty pointed other, sad thing often she forgot pause consider she ought follow; occasion, usual, she took naughty side question, prepared indulge her curiosity, though anxious nothing might happen displease her grandmama. She observed distance terrace, remarkably large thick holly-bush, near great procession company would probably pass long, therefore, hoping nobody could possibly see her there, she stole hastily garden, concealed herself behind it; children wrong, hopes found out, generally find mistaken, Laura soon discovered her cost. It lucky, however, culprits, detected, may learn never behave foolishly again, greatest misfortune happen child is, found punished he wrong. A minutes Laura taken her station behind holly-bush, crowds ladies officers came strolling along, near her hiding-place, she saw distinctly, felt excessively amused delighted first, perched like bird tree watching grand party, nobody saw her, guessed she there. Presently, however, Laura became sadly frightened officer scarlet coat happened look towards holly-bush, exclaimed, surprise, "There surely something odd plant! I see large pink spots leaves!" "Oh no, Captain Digby, quite mistaken," answered one ladies, dressed bright yellow bonnet green pelisse. "I see nothing particular there! common ugly bush holly! I wonder ever thought noticing it!" "But, Miss Perceval! certainly something curious behind! I would bet five one is!" replied Captain Digby, stepping up, close holly-bush, peeping over: "What here! ragged little girl, I believe! pink frock!" Poor Laura terrible scrape; she started immediately run away. Probably she never ran fast her life before, Captain Digby person enjoyed joke, he called "Tally-ho! race thousand pounds!" Off set Captain, away flew Laura. At time she would thought capital fun, she frightened her wits, tore away top her speed. The whole party ladies gentlemen stood laughing, applauding, see fast cleared ground, Laura, seeing garden gate still wide open, hoped she might able dart in, close it, alas! she arrived within four steps threshold, feeling almost certain escape, Captain Digby seized hold her pink frock behind. It instantly began tearing, she great hopes leaving piece his hand getting off; he clever that, he grasped hold her long sash, floating far behind, led Laura prisoner whole company. When Lady Harriet discovered really Laura advancing, her head hanging down, her hair streaming her ears, her face like full moon, she could scarcely credit her eyes, held her hands astonishment, uncle David shrugged his shoulders, till almost met his head, word said either side got home, Lady Harriet last broke awful silence saying, "My dear girl! must, course, severely punished act disobedience, much account feeling angry misconduct I mean correct you, I love you, wish make behave better future. Parents appointed God govern children he governs us, carelessly indulging faults, wisely correcting them, told Great Father heaven chastens he loves, afflicts us great wise purposes. I suffered many sorrows world, always made better end, whatever discipline meet me, Great Being loves still I do, let teach consider ways, repent wilfulness, pray may enabled act properly future." "Yes, grandmama," replied Laura, tears her eyes, "I quite willing punished, wrong indeed make vexed ashamed, disobeying orders." "Then long task must study dinner, penalty trespassing bounds. It beautiful poem death Sir John Moore, every school-girl repeat, rather long, scarcely time learn perfectly, coming dessert, therefore, may quite ready, I shall ring Lady Rockville's maid, washed dressed immediately. Remember last clean frock, sure spoil it." When Laura chose pay attention, she could learn her lessons wonderfully fast, her eyes seemed nailed book time Lady Harriet went away, till last she could repeat whole poem perfectly well. It neither "slowly sadly" Laura "laid down" her book, practising all, sort jig time, till she could rattle poem like rail-road, she walked window, still murmuring verses herself prodigious glee, giving little thought melancholy subject. A variety plans suggested her mind amusing herself within doors, she forbidden venture out, she lost time executing them. First, she tried her grandmama's caps looking-glass, none improved crushed tumbled way. Then she quarrelled Lady Rockville's beautiful cockatoo, till bit her finger violently, that, she teazed old cat till scratched her; diversions sufficiently entertaining, Laura began grow rather tired, till last she went gaze portico Holiday House, perfectly determined, account whatever, go one single step farther. Here Laura saw many things entertained her extremely, she scarcely ever seen country enjoyed Mrs. Crabtree Charlotte Square. The punctual crows returning home usual hour evening, looked like black shower her head, hundreds seemed trying make concert once; robins hopped close her feet, evidently accustomed fed; tame pheasant, fat London alderman, came steps keep her company; peacock, spreading his tail, strutting about, looked picture silly pride vanity. Laura admired enjoyed extremely, crumbled nearly loaf bread, she scattered ground, order popular among her visitors, took could get her, quarrelled among it, much boys girls would perhaps done circumstances. It happened moment, large flock geese crossed park, way towards river, stalking along slow majestic manner, heads high air. Laura observed distance, thought prettiest creatures world, pure white feathers yellow stockings, she wondered kind birds were, never seen goose before, except roasted dinner, though, indeed, she sad goose herself, soon told. "How I like examine large, white, beautiful birds, little nearer," thought Laura herself. "I wonder could swim fly!--oh! perfect would look, floating like water-lilies river, I might take bit bread throw in, would rush it!" Laura, usual, wait reflect her grandmama might likely think; indeed feared Laura forgot moment she grandmama all, her mind never large enough hold one thing time, entirely filled flock geese. She instantly set pursuit them, began chasing whole party across park, making sorts dreadful noises, hopes might fly; but, contrary, held heads, she dancing-master, marched slowly on, cackling loudly other, evidently getting extremely angry. Laura quite close her new acquaintances, even threw pebble hurry forward, suddenly old gander stopped, turned round terrible rage. The whole flock geese same, flew towards Laura, bills wide open, hissing furiously, stretching long necks angry menacing way, wished tear her pieces. Poor Laura became frightened wits she ever had, ran off, geese her! Anybody must laughed fits, could heard triumphant cackle geese set up, seen fast she flew away. If Laura borrowed pair wings her pursuers, she could scarcely got quickly on. In hurry escaping, she always looked back see enemy followed, scarcely observed way she ran herself, till suddenly her foot stumbled large stone, she fell headlong river!--oh, scream Laura gave! terrified even old gander himself, sent whole flock geese marching off, nearly fast come; Laura's cries also reached, great distance, ears somebody, she would sorry think heard them. Lady Harriet, her friends Holiday House, taking delightful walk fine old fir trees, banks river, admiring beautiful scenery, Miss Perceval admiring nothing her fine pocket handkerchief, cost ten guineas, worked her name, trimmed lace, perfumed eau de Cologne; Captain Digby admiring his scarlet uniform, reflected bright clear water, varying his employment occasionally throwing pebbles stream, see far would go. Suddenly, however, he stopped, look surprise alarm, saying, "What noise be!--a loud scream water!" "Oh dear, no! one horrid peacocks," answered Miss Perceval, waving her fine pocket handkerchief. "They disagreeable, noisy creatures world! If mama ever keeps one, I shall get singing-master, put muzzle his mouth!" "But surely something splashing river great distance. Do see that!--what be?" "Nothing all, depend upon it! I could bet value pocket handkerchief, ten guineas, nothing. Officers live constantly barracks unaccustomed country, seem expect something wonderful shall happen every minute! That probably salmon minnow." "I determined, however, see. If quite sure salmon, promise eat dinner whatever find, provided I catch it?" "Certainly! unless catch whale! Oh! I dropped pocket handkerchief,--pray pick up!" Captain Digby so; without waiting examine pattern, he instantly ran forward, his great astonishment, saw Laura her knees river, trying scramble out, her face white terror, her limbs trembled cold, like poodle dog newly washed. "Why, again!--the little girl I caught morning," cried he, laughing heartily, he carefully pulled Laura towards bank, though, so, he splashed his beautiful uniform distressingly. "We complete game bo-peep to-day, friend! comes lady promised eat up, therefore I shall trouble." Laura would consented eaten pleasure, rather encounter Lady Harriet's eye, really recognize her first minute, one suppose figure she appeared. The last clean frock covered entirely mud--her hair dripping water--and her new yellow sash might colour world. Laura felt completely ashamed she could look ground, sorry she could speak, hot tears mingled cold water trickled her face. "What matter! Who this?" cried Lady Harriet, hurrying place stood. "Laura!! Impossible!!!" "Let put pair spectacles, I cannot believe eyes without them!" said Major Graham. "Ah! sure enough Laura, looking Laura I never saw before. You must nice cold bath!" "I heard," continued Lady Harriet, "that naughty people often ducked water punishment, respect I sure Laura deserves she got, great deal more." "She reminds me," observed Captain Digby, "of Chinese bird legs, constantly flies place place, never moment rest." "Follow me, Laura," said Lady Harriet, "that I may hear whether anything say occasion. It scarcely possible excuse, nobody condemned unheard." When Laura put dry clothes, she told her whole history, entreated Lady Harriet hear perfectly she first learned her task, venturing stir room; upon her grandmama consented, amidst tears sobs, monody Sir John Moore repeated without single mistake. Lady Rockville came in, entreat that, last day visit Holiday House, Laura might forgiven permitted appear dessert, company anxious see her, particularly Captain Digby, regretted he means first getting her scrape. "Indeed, dear Lady Rockville! I might perhaps agreed wishes," answered Lady Harriet, "particularly Laura seems sincerely sorry, premeditate her disobedience; she actually tolerable frock appear now!" "I must lend her one velvet dresses destroy next," said Lady Rockville, smiling. "Uncle David's Mackintosh cloak would fittest thing her wear," replied Lady Harriet, rising leave room. "Laura, must learn double task now! Here is! Lady Rockville's request I excuse once; though I sorry that, sufficient reasons, cannot see dessert, otherwise I happy do." Laura sat cried quarter hour Lady Harriet gone dinner. She felt sorry behaved ill, sorry vexed her good grandmama; sorry see fine party dessert; sorry think next day she must leave Holiday House; sorry, last all, consider Mrs. Crabtree would say her ruined frocks brought home. In short, poor Laura felt perfectly overwhelmed greatness variety her griefs, scarcely believed one world ever miserable herself. Her eyes fixed her task, her thoughts wandering fifty miles away it, housemaid, frequently attended upon Laura her visit, accidentally entered room, seemed much surprised, well concerned, find young lady way, her sobbing could heard next room. It quite relief see one; Laura told sad adventures day, without attempting conceal naughty she been; attentively her narrative listened to, till end. "You see, Miss!" observed Nelly, "when people does not behave well, must expect punished." "So should!" sobbed Laura; "and I dare say make better! I would pass miserable day again, world; I deserve punished I am." "That is right, Miss!" replied Nelly, pleased see good effect her admonitions. "Punishment sure us good naughty, physic ill. But you will go dessert, forget all." "No! grandmama would allowed me, Lady Rockville every body kind inviting down; last clean frock quite unfit seen, I none put on. Oh, dear! thousand million pities!" "Is all, Miss! Then dry eyes, I wash frock ten minutes. Give me, learn lesson, ready I come back." Laura sprung her seat joy proposal, ran--or rather flew--to fetch her miserable object frock, Nelly crumpled her arm, walked away with, haste she evidently determined return soon; Laura took her good advice, sat learn her task, though she could hardly look book two minutes time--she watched impatiently her benefactress laundry. At length door flew open, walked Nelly, whose face looked red hot beefsteak; her hand she carried basket, laid out, great state, cleanest frock ever seen! It perfectly smelled soap water, starch hot irons, seemed still almost smoking laundry; Laura looked delight admiration, might supposed she never saw clean frock before. When Lady Harriet sitting dinner day, sipping her wine, thinking thing particular, she became surprised feel somebody gently twitching her sleeve attract notice. Turning instantly round ascertain matter, could be, her astonishment see Laura her elbow, looking rather shy frightened. "How get here, child!" exclaimed Lady Harriet, accents amazement, though almost laughing. "Am I never see last to-day! Where get frock! It must dropped clouds! Or good fairy give new one?" "That good fairy Nelly housemaid," whispered Laura. "She first tossed frock washing-tub; great kitchen fire she toasted it, and----" "----And buttered it, I hope," added Major Graham. "Come here, Laura! I read written grandmama's face moment; says, 'you tiresome little puss, nobody keep order except uncle David;' therefore sit beside him, eat many almonds raisins he bids you." "You nice, funny uncle David!" whispered Laura, crushing her way his chair Miss Perceval's, "nobody need tongue now, read exactly thinking." "But Miss Perceval, still wonderful; she knows bumps head, contained inside. Let see I could so! There large bump reading, small one writing arithmetic. Here terrible organ breaking dolls destroying frocks. There small bump liking uncle David, prodigious one liking almonds raisins!" "No! quite mistaken! It largest bump loving uncle David, small one every thing else," interrupted Laura, eagerly. "I shall draw map head day, show divided." "And leave room thing naughty foolish! Your head swept out, put order every morning, single cobweb may remain brains. What busy brains must next ten years! But meantime let us hope never reduced "LAST CLEAN FROCK." CHAPTER VI. THE LONG LADDER. There young pickle, think? He liv'd upon nothing victuals drink; Victuals drink chief his diet, And yet young pickle could never quiet. One fine sultry day month August, Harry Laura stood breakfast-room window, wondering see large broken white clouds, looking like curds whey, sun blaze heat, every thing seemed almost red hot. The street door become blistered sun-beams. Jowler dog lay basking pavement; green blinds closed every opposite house; gentlemen ventured out, fanning pocket handkerchiefs; ladies strolling lazily along, umbrageous shade green parasols; poor people accustomed winter sell matches lighting fire, carried gaudy paper hangings empty grates. Lady Harriet found butter melted breakfast, she could scarcely lift her knife; uncle David complained sight hot smoking tea put fever, said he wished could iced. "I wonder iced porridge would taste!" said Harry. "I put mine open window cool, made seem hotter. We talking gentleman mentioned yesterday, toasted his muffins volcano; certainly might almost done drawing-room window morning." "Wait till arrive countries I visited, where, somebody remarked, salamanders die heat. At Agra, hottest part India, could scarcely write letter, ink dries pen get paper. I obliged, regiment there, lie middle day, several hours, actually gasping breath; make that, rose midnight. An officer ours, lived long India, got always three morning, returned home, walked streets Portsmouth, wondering become everybody." "I shall try grumble weather more," said Laura. "We seem worse people." "Or rather great deal better off! At Bermuda, regiment stopped way America, inhabitants tormented high winds, build 'hurricane houses'--low, flat rooms, families must retire storm comes on, trees, houses, people, cattle, whirled violence, life safe island lasts." "That reminds me," said Lady Harriet, "of droll mistake made yesterday African camel, he landed Leith. His keepers leading along high road made show Edinburgh, time wind particularly high; poor animal encountering clouds dust, thought must simoon desert, threw flat down, burying his nose ground, according custom occasions. It great difficulty he could last induced face danger, proceed." "Quite compliment dust," observed Laura. "But really hot day, kangaroos tigers might feel perfectly home here. Oh! I like visit GEOlogical Gardens London!" "Then suppose set immediately!" said Major Graham, pretending rise his chair. "Your grandmama's donkey-carriage holds two." "Ah! could carry donkey-carriage easily could carry you!" "Shall I try? Well, go, pay turnpikes, I remember time, hundred years ago, Harry thought paying gates expense travelling. You asked poor grandmama could afford many shillings sixpences." "We know every thing though!" said Harry, nodding sagacious manner. "I tell exactly much time takes going public coach London, sleeps one night road." "Sleeps!" cried uncle David. "What! puts night-cap, goes bed?" "Yes! dines breakfasts too, Mr. uncle David, I heard Mrs. Crabtree say so." "Never name anybody, unless wish see her immediately," said Major Graham, hearing well-known tap door. "As sure mention absent person, he supposed fifty miles time, rather odd, he instantly appears!" "Then somebody I shall speak often." "Who Mr. Somebody be?" asked uncle David, smiling. "A foolish person spoils I dare say, gives large slices bread jelly like this. Hold carefully! Now, good bye, joy you." But rather rueful faces Harry Laura left room, wishing might remained another hour talk nonsense uncle David, dreading think new scrapes difficulties would get nursery, always seemed place torture imprisonment. Major Graham used say Mrs. Crabtree always thermometer her room she dressed, tell her whether weather hot cold, she seemed feel difference, scarcely ever made change her attire, wearing always pink gown scarlet shawl, made her look like large red flower-pot, she annoyed heat flower-pot would been. On oppressive morning she took much pains suffocating Harry silk handkerchief round his neck, Christmas, though Laura begged hard leave go without one her half-a-dozen wrappings, she might well asked permission go without her head, Mrs. Crabtree seemed perfectly deaf upon subject. "This day cold shivering," said Harry, slyly, "that I suppose make Laura wear least fifty shawls." "Not twenty," answered Mrs. Crabtree, dryly. "Give nonsense, Master Harry! This business yours! I world long born, must know best; hold tongue. None fools beggars need ever cold." At last Mrs. Crabtree heaped many clothes upon her two little victims, she pleased think necessary; she sallied forth them, followed Betty, proceeded towards country, taking sunny side road, raising clouds dust every step, till Harry Laura felt made wax, melting away. "Mrs. Crabtree!" said Harry, "did hear uncle David's funny story yesterday? One hot morning gentleman watching ant's nest, he observed, every little insect, came out, plucked small leaf, hold head, parasol! I wish could find leaves large enough us." "You must go Botanical Gardens, one leaf palm-tree shown grandmama, measured fourteen feet long," observed Laura. "How horrid warm countries must be, heat year round like this!" "You may well say that," answered Mrs. Crabtree. "I would go East Indies--no! I Governess-General,--to running away tiger back, sleeping real live serpents twisted round bed-post, scorpions pillow! Catch there! I am often quite sorry Master Frank, think his ship maybe going way! I am told rats smell outlandish place, touch outside bottle tails, tastes musk ever after; people sitting comfortably down, expecting enjoy dinner, swarm great ants come, fall, inch thick, side-dishes. I have desire whatever see foreign parts!" "But I wish see every country universe," said Harry; "and I hope rail-road round world I grown up. Only think, Mrs. Crabtree, fun lion-hunting must be, catching dolphins, riding elephants." The pedestrians arrived pretty village Corstorphine, unexpectedly met Peter Grey, joined without waiting ask leave. Here hills beautifully wooded, villas charming, Harry, Peter, Laura stopped moment, consider house would like best live in. Near one side road stood large cart hay, top several men, forking window high loft, could entered long ladder leaned wall. It busy joyous scene, soon attracted children's whole attention, transfixed delight, seeing rapidly people ran down, pitchforks hands, tilted hay cart loft, many jokes much laughter among themselves. At last whole business finished, workmen drove away another supply, neighbouring fields, raking tossing morning, merry crickets. "What happy people!" exclaimed Harry, looking wistfully party, wishing he might scrambled cart beside them. "I would haymaker nothing, anybody would employ me; would you, Peter?" "It strange," said Master Grey, "why little ladies gentlemen seem always obliged endure perfectly useless walk every day, Laura now. You never saw animals set take stroll good healths! How odd would see couple dogs set country walk!" "Miss Laura!" said Mrs. Crabtree, "Master Harry may rest minute two Master Peter, let count fingers, come Betty visit sick old aunt mine lives round corner; sure, boys, presume wander about, I shall punish severely. We coming back two minutes." Mrs. Crabtree scarcely disappeared small shabby-looking cottage, Peter turned eagerly Harry, face great joy importance, exclaiming, "Only see lucky is! The haymakers left long ladder, standing purpose us! The window loft wide open, I must climb immediately peep in, never, life, I see inside hay-loft before!" "Nor I!" added Harry. "Uncle David says, round floor deep holes, called mangers, food thrown horses, thrust heads in, take bite, whenever choose." "How I hate dinner hung always nose way! Suppose kitchen placed nursery, Mrs. Marmalade showered tarts puddings, remain till ate them, would hate sight things last. But now, Harry, hay-loft." Peter scrambled rapidly ladder, he soon reached top, instantly vanished window, calling eagerly Harry follow. "You never saw nice, clean, funny place this, life!--make haste!--come faster!--never mind crushing hat tearing jacket,--I will put rights. Ah! there!--that is thing!--walk up, gentlemen! walk up!--the grand show!--sixpence each, children half-price!" All time, Harry slowly, great difficulty, picking his steps ladder, troublesome business was! First, his foot became entangled rope,--then his hat got squeezed shape, looked perfectly tipsy,--next, one his shoes nearly came off,--and afterwards he dropped his gloves; last he stumbled safety, stood beside Peter loft, laughing delight enterprize. The quantity hay piled sides, astonished greatly, nice, wide floor between, seemed larger drawing-room, certainly made purpose romp. Harry rolled large ball hay throw Peter, he, return, aimed him, ran other, round round loft, raising riot, "rafters dirled." The hay flew clouds, jumped it, crept it, throwing handfuls every direction, observing best play-room ever in. "How lucky came here!" cried Peter. "I like stay hour least!" "Oh! two hours,--or three,--or day," added Harry. "But shall Mrs. Crabtree? She gone settle life old sick aunt, I afraid must really hurrying back, case she may find expedition, that, know, Peter, would dreadful!" "Only fancy, Harry, she sees clinging ladder, half way down! way she would in!" "We better make haste," said Harry, looking around. "What would grandmama say!--I wish never come up!" At moment, Harry still brought his senses, hearing Mrs. Crabtree's voice, exclaiming, loud angry accents, "Where world troublesome boys gone! I must tether tree next time left together! Why! sure! would venture long ladder hay-loft! If have, better never come again, I shall shew master here." "Peter Grey would run ladder stars, he could find one," replied Betty. "Here Master Harry's gloves lying bottom it. They gone nowhere else, I searched every place. We must send town-crier his bell them, found there!" Mrs. Crabtree seemed fearfully angry, Laura began tremble fright Harry, listening overhead, know well do, foolishly thought best put evil hour punished long possible; he Peter silently crept great quantity hay, hid cunningly, even thief-catcher could scarcely discovered den. In dark corner, Harry time reflect feel alarmed sorry his misconduct, he said, distressed voice, "Oh, Peter! pity ever naughty, always found out, always much happier good!" "I wonder Mrs. Crabtree get long ladder?" whispered Peter, laughing. "I would give little finger, one ears, see her Betty scrambling along!" Harry pinch Peter's arm almost black blue he would quiet; time he stopped talking, Mrs. Crabtree Betty standing hay-loft, exceedingly breath climbing unusually high, Mrs. Crabtree nearly fell, stumbled step entrance. "Why, sure! there is nobody here!" exclaimed she, disappointed tone. "And disorderly place is! I thought hay-loft always kept nice order, floor swept! fine mess! Those two great lumps hay corner look meant people sleep upon!" Harry gave lost Mrs. Crabtree noticed place he Peter buried alive; his great relief, suspicion seemed excited, neither two searchers anxious venture beyond door, nearly tripped upon threshold. "They must stolen gipsey, perhaps fallen well," said Betty, rather liked bustle accident. "I always thought Master Peter would break his neck, something kind. Poor thing! distressed his papa be!" "Hold tongue," interrupted Mrs. Crabtree, angrily. "I wish people would either speak sense, speak all! Did hear noise among hay?" "Rats, I dare say! perhaps dog!" answered Betty, turning hastily round, hurrying ladder faster she come up. "I certainly thought something moved yon far corner." "Where little shrimp boy hid?" added Mrs. Crabtree, following. "He must obedience knocked like nail his head, good severe blows. I shall beat powder catch him." "You may depend upon it," persisted Betty, "that gipsey got boys sake clothes. It great pity, Master Harry his best blue jacket trowsers." No sooner loft cleared unwelcome visitors, Harry Peter began recover panic, jumped hay, shaking free it, skipping greater glee ever. While played about, done before, tumbled tumblers Ducrow's, poor Harry got spirits, he completely forgot deep holes called mangers, containing horse's food, till once, Peter running him, he fell, loud crash, headlong one them! Oh! scream he gave!--it echoed stable, terrifying whole team horses feeding there, particularly one whose manger he fallen. The horse gave tremendous start Harry plunged close his nose, able run away, he put back his ears, opened his mouth, kicked struggled frightful manner, Harry, could make his escape horse, shouted louder louder help. Peter he could assist Harry extraordinary predicament, finding impossible use, he forgot terror Mrs. Crabtree his fears Harry, rushed window, calling back two pursuers, walking away great distance. He screamed hollooed, waved his handkerchief, without ceasing, till last Mrs. Crabtree heard him, turned round, never anybody astonished she was, seeing there, she scolded, stormed, raged, foot ladder. "Now, besiegers, I garrison!" cried Peter, he saw Mrs. Crabtree panting toiling her ascent. "We must make treaty peace together, I could tumble minute, merely pushing end little one side!" "Do touch it, Master Peter!" cried Mrs. Crabtree, almost afraid he earnest. "There good boy,--be quiet!" "A good boy!!" whispered Peter himself. "What fright Mrs. Crabtree must in, she said that!" The next moment Mrs. Crabtree snatched Harry manger, shook rage. She scolded beat him, till he perfectly stupified fright misery, whole party allowed proceed towards home, Harry stumbled along road, hung his head, wishing, fifty times over, he Peter Grey never gone THE LONG LADDER. CHAPTER VII. THE MAD BULL. There is something noble boy, A brave, free-hearted, careless one; With his uncheck'd, unbidden joy, His dread books love fun. And his clear ready smile, Unshaded thought guile And unrepress'd sadness,-- Which brings childhood back, As I trod track, And felt gladness. Willis. One evening, Harry Laura came dessert, surprised observe two little plates usually intended them, turned upside down, uncle David pretended notice anything, though he stole glance see would happen next. On lifting mysterious plates, see lying underneath, two letters large red seals, one directed "Master Harry Graham," "Miss Laura Graham." "A letter me!!" cried Harry, tone delighted astonishment, he tore open seal, his hand shook impatience, he could hardly unfold paper. "What about! I like getting letter much! Is papa? Did postman bring it?" "Yes, he did," said uncle David: "and he left message must pay hundred pounds to-morrow." "Very likely, indeed," said Laura; "you pay telling fine story; letter worth hundred pounds, inviting spend another delightful week Holiday House." "I asked too! Mrs. Crabtree!" cried Harry, looking his letter, almost screaming joy, whilst he skipped room, rubbing his hands together, ended twirling Laura round round, till fell prostrate floor. "If meant specimen intend behave Holiday House, better send apology once," observed Lady Harriet, smiling. "Lord Rockville particular never hearing noise, slamming door, even creaking pair unruly shoes, would put distracted." "Yes!" added uncle David, "Holiday House quiet Harry's drum hole it. If pin drops part mansion, Lord Rockville becomes annoyed, wasps scarcely dare buz his window loud person's. You feel quite fish-out-of-water-ish, trying quiet hum-drum whole week, let advise go." "The meaning advice always something one would rather wish do," observed Laura, gravely. "I never life advised enjoy anything pleasant! Taking physic--or learning lessons--or staying home, often advised, never playing--or holiday--or amusing ourselves!" "You know, Laura! Harry's little Shetland pony, Tom Thumb, field, use present, kicks, capers, runs day; yet presently he led fastened rope, made trot round round circle, day day, till he longer his own,--that education. Afterwards he shall bridle put his mouth, little girls would much better also, he shall carefully guided ever afterwards best ways; likewise go much steadily reining-in whipping got Mrs. Crabtree me, may, perhaps, make keep road duty easily hereafter." "Uncle David!" said Harry, laughing, "we read Arabian Nights, people turned animals, I never thought would turn Laura horse! What shall little Shetland pony I go away next week?" "I thought capital plan making Tom Thumb useful whole winter! Your grandmama wants watch-dog country, shall build kennel--put chain round his neck, get one teach bark." "Uncle David Professor Nonsense University," said Lady Harriet, smiling. "But, dear children, allowed pay visit Holiday House, I hope endeavour behave creditably?" "Yes," added Major Graham, "I understand Lord Rockville wished particularly quiet children there, short time, he fixed upon Harry Laura! Poor, mistaken Lord Rockville! But, good friends, try break his china ornaments first day--spare jars tea-cups--leave pane glass two windows, throw none marbles mirrors." "I remember hearing," said Lady Harriet, "that Miss Pelham married last year, her old aunt, Mrs. Bouverie, sent her said, she could afford give baubles trinkets, she would give her valuable piece advice; think was, Laura?" "I idea! Do tell me." "Then I shall bestow you, old lady her niece--'Be careful china, paper string, transitory possessions world!'" "Very true! judicious!" observed Major Graham, laughing. "I certainly know several persons must served apprenticeship good lady. Many gentlemen now, despatch epistles club, paper costs nothing, number ladies, who, good reason, never write letters till visiting country house." Having received many warnings injunctions behaving well, Harry Laura became quiet first days Holiday House, like shadows flitting rooms, going almost tiptoe, scarcely speaking whisper, observing valuable rule children, let seen, heard. Lord Rockville quite charmed extreme good conduct, especial awe him, thought great condescension he even looked them, he tall, grand, grave, wearing large powdered wig silver spectacles, gave particularly venerable appearance, though Harry one day near getting disgrace upon subject. His Lordship habit always carrying two pairs spectacles his pocket, often, thrusting one pair high his forehead, he forgot were, put others his nose, droll appearance, first time Harry saw it, he felt quite taken surprise, burst fit laughter, upon Lord Rockville gave comical look surprise perplexity, Harry's fit laughing got worse worse. The people know wrong, try stop, convulsive becomes, difficult look grave again, last, repeated efforts appear serious composed, Harry started up, his hurry escape, nearly slammed door behind him, would given last finish his offences. Both little visitors found Lady Rockville extremely indulgent kind, she seemed like another grandmama, therefore gradually ventured talk nonsense her, even try old ways, frolicsome tricks, she seldom found fault with, except Harry one day eloped Lord Rockville's favourite walking-stick, used fishing-rod among minnows, long thread end line, crooked pin represent hook, while, day, Laura privately mounted ass gave Lord Rockville's ass's milk, rode round park, he sat home expecting his usual refreshing tumbler. Still passed muster tolerable children, his Lordship heard say, voice great approbation, Master Miss Graham punctual dinner, perfectly quiet, he really often forgot house. Indeed, Harry's complaisance day he laughed injudiciously spectacles, quite unheard of, he felt anxious make his misconduct; Lord Rockville asked he would like fire play-room, evening chilly, he answered politely, "Thank you, Lord! We ready think hot cold, please!" All good last! One morning, Harry Laura looked window, deplorably wet day. The whole sky looked like large grey cotton umbrella, clouds low Harry thought he could almost touched them. In short, Lord Rockville remarked, "it rained cats dogs," his Lordship knitted his brows, thrust his hands his waistcoat pockets, walking room perfect fume vexation, he accustomed obeyed, seemed rather hardship even weather contradicted his wishes. To complete his vexation, "single misfortunes never come alone," his valet, carelessly drying Morning Post large kitchen fire, set flames, wonderful news contained became reduced ashes, therefore Lord Rockville might well given notice, that, day least, he right extremely bad humour. Lady Rockville privately recommended Harry Laura sit quietly play cat's cradle, accordingly did, became longer endurable, dominos produced. Thus morning wore tediously away till two of the clock, suddenly rain stopped, sun burst forth prodigious splendour, every leaf park glittered, sprinkled diamonds, hundred birds seemed singing chorus joy, bees butterflies fluttered windows flew away rejoicing. Harry first observe delightful change, exclamation delight, he sprang his seat, pulled Laura hers, upset domino-table, rushed room, slamming door report like twenty cannons. Away flew forest, Laura swinging her bonnet her hand, Harry tossing his cap air, Lord Rockville watched angrily drawing-room window, saying, tone extreme displeasure, "That boy voice might town-crier! He laughs loud, enough crack every glass room! I wish he condemned pass week American prisons one allowed speak. In short, he would better anywhere here, I might well live hammer tongs, two children together. They restless quicksilver figures China, I wish quiet, comfort is, rate come home punctually dinner five. Nothing intolerable people dropping late disordering table." Meantime, woods Holiday House rung sounds mirth gaiety, Harry scrambled trees like squirrel, swung upon branches, gathering walnuts crab-apples Laura, cut names upon bark Lord Rockville's favourite beech, every person passed way must observe large distinct letters. They laughing chatting exploit, talking once, noisy happy possible, expecting nothing particular happen, when, sudden, Laura turned pale, grasped hold Harry's arm, saying, low frightened voice, "Hush, Harry!--hush!--I hear strange noise. It sounds like wild beast! What be?" Harry listened he ten pair ears, nearly cracked his eye-balls staring round him, see could matter. A curious deep growling sound might heard distance, noise something trampling heavily ground, branches breaking trees, large creature forcing his way through. Harry Laura stood like couple little statues, daring breathe, felt terrified! The noise grew louder louder, gradually came nearer nearer, till length large black bull burst view, his tail standing high air, he tore ground his horns, bellowing loudly he could roar, galloping straight towards place stood. Laura's knees tottered her, she instantly dropped ground terror, feeling she would die next minute fright, while, attempting escape, never entered her head think possible. Harry felt quite differently, he bold boy, easily scared his senses, instantly saw something must done, would lost. Many selfish people would run away alone, without caring safety one themselves, case Harry, thought first his poor frightened companion. "Hollo, Laura! hiding cart rut?" he exclaimed, pulling her hastily ground. "The bull soon find there! Come! come! fast possible! must race yet! That terrible beast scarcely make his way trees branches, grow closely! Perhaps may get fast he!" All time, Harry dragging Laura along, running thickest part plantation; difficult make progress, she become quite faint bewildered fright. "Oh, Harry!" cried she, trembling over, "you must get alone! I weak terror, impossible run step farther." "Do waste breath talking," answered Harry, still pushing full speed. "How suppose I would shabby make escape without you! No! no! must either caught, get off!" Laura felt grateful Harry he said this, she seemed moment almost forget bull, still coming furiously behind, she made desperate exertion run faster she able before, clearing ground almost rapidly Harry could done, though he still held her firmly hand, encourage her. The trampling noise continued, breaking branches, frightful bellowing dreadful animal, last Harry caught sight wooden paling, he silently pointed Laura, quite unable speak. Having rushed forward it, almost frantic haste, Harry threw top, he helped Laura squeeze herself underneath, proceeded rather leisurely onwards. "That fence puzzle Mr. Bull," said Harry triumphantly, yet gasping breath. "We push places his great hoof could scarcely thrust! I saw coming along, his heels high air, his head down, like enormous wheel-barrow." Scarcely Harry spoken, infuriated animal advanced full gallop towards fence, running along side little way, he suddenly tore paling his horns, made paper, rushed forward rapidly ever. Harry began fear indeed over, his strength become nearly exhausted, when, his great joy, he espied large, rough stone wall, far off, welcome sight land shipwrecked sailor. "Run life, Laura!" he cried, pointing out, encourage her. "There safety, reach it." On flew, faster wind, Harry scrambled wall, like grasshopper, pulled Laura beside him, stood last, encamped quite beyond reach danger, though enemy arrived minutes afterwards, pawing air, foaming bellowing disappointment. "Laura!" said Harry, she little recovered her fright, walking slowly homewards, she cast alarmed glance frequently behind, thinking she still heard bull pursuit, "you see, uncle David says, whatever danger people in, foolish quite despair, rather think best do, directly." "Yes, Harry! I shall never forget would forsake me, risked life, like brave brother, defence. I like much another time!" "Thank you, Laura, much had, I hope shall never scrape again! If Frank here, he would put us mind thank merciful God taking much care us, bringing us safely home!" "Yes, Harry! It perhaps good thing danger sometimes, remind us cannot safe happy hour without God's care, prayers to-night must remember happened, return thanks particularly." It long past five Harry Laura reached Holiday House, Lord Rockville met drawing-room door, looking taller, grander, graver ever, Lady Rockville rose her sofa, came them, saying, tone gentle reproach, "My dear children! ought return home dinner hour, keep his Lordship waiting!" The idea Lord Rockville waiting dinner dreadful ever entered heads till minute; Harry Laura immediately explained exceedingly sorry occurred, show misfortune rather fault, told whole frightful story mad bull, Lady Rockville listened, her hair standing upon end, hear doings. She even turned her eyes astonishment think wonderful escape made; his Lordship frowned his spectacles, leaned his chin upon his stick, looking, Harry thought, like bear upon pole. "Pshaw!--nonsense!" exclaimed Lord Rockville impatiently. "The bull would done harm! He respectable, quiet, well-disposed animal, brought excellent character his last place! I never heard complaint before!" "It curious," observed Laura, "that bulls reckoned peaceable tame, till tossed two three people, killed them!" "I thought," added Lord Rockville, looking grand contemptuous, "that Harry grown man easily put flight. When bull, another time, threatens toss you, seize hold his tail,--or toss him!--or, short, anything rather run away first time animal looks you. This mere cock-and-a-bull story, excuse keeping waiting almost quarter hour dinner!--you made guard mail-coach month, teach punctuality, Master Graham." Lord Rockville gravely looked his watch, Harry luckily considered often his grandmama recommended make answer he scolded, he nearly bit tip his tongue keep quiet, he could wish, his mind, Lord saw fierce bull looked. Laura felt vexed Harry's account her own, dinner went uncomfortably possible; even French cook dressed it, ill-humour sauce, dish becomes unpalatable. Nothing seen reflected surface many fine silver covers, cross, melancholy faces; Lady Rockville tried make her countenance look cheerful good-natured. She told Harry Laura, divert them, old Mrs. Bouverie pursued furious milch cow, along lane, flanked sides high walls, escape seemed impossible, good lady, fat breathless, became desperate, without hope getting off, she seized enraged animal horns, screamed face, till cow herself became frightened. The creature stared, stepping backwards backwards, increasing alarm, till last, old lady's great relief surprise, she fairly turned her tail ran off. In evening, Lord Rockville yet recovered his equanimity, went out, rather bad humour, take his usual walk supper. Without remembering Harry bull, he strolled great way woods, marking several trees cut down, admiring fine forest he planted long ago, without particularly considering way he turned. It beginning, last, grow dark gloomy, Lord Rockville thoughts returning home, he became suddenly startled hearing loud roar far off, moment afterwards furious bull dashed neighbouring thicket, raging foaming, tearing ground his horns, exactly Harry described morning, poor Lord Rockville, seldom moved faster dignified walk, instantly quickened his pace, opposite direction, striding away faster faster, till last,--it must confessed,--his Lordship ended running!!! In spite Lord Rockville's exertions, bull continued rapidly gain upon him, his Lordship, rather corpulent easily fatigued, stopped every gasp breath; till last, feeling impossible get faster, though stables within sight, he seized branch large oak tree, swept nearly ground, contrived, great difficulty, scramble reach. The enraged bull gazed tree bellowed fury, he saw Lord Rockville judiciously perched overhead, he remained half-an-hour, watching see his Lordship would venture again. At last tormenting animal began leisurely eating grass tree, gradually he moved away, turning his back he fed, till Lord Rockville vainly deluded hope stealing unobserved. Being somewhat rested refreshed, enemy looking another direction, he descended cautiously, he going tread upon needles pins; but, unaccustomed movements, he jumped heavily upon ground, bull hearing noise, turned round, set loud furious roar, he saw his intended victim within reach. Now race began redoubled agility! The odds seemed greatly favour bull, Lord Rockville thought he already felt animal's horns his side, groom, saw party approaching, instantly seized pitchfork flew rescue his master. Lord Rockville never stopped his career till he reached stable, ran loft, window he gave alarm called assistance, several ploughmen stable-boys assembled, drove animal great difficulty, stall, he continued ungovernable, iron chains put round his neck, days afterwards, seeing one could manage him, Lord Rockville ordered bull shot, his carcase turned beef poor parish, all, consequently, rejoiced his demise; though meat turned tough, required best teeth eat with. Meantime, memorable evening many adventures, Harry, Laura, Lady Rockville, wondered often become his Lordship, and, last, supper appeared usual hour, his absence became still unaccountable! "What matter?" exclaimed Lady Rockville, anxiously. "This odd! His Lordship punctual postman general! especially supper; Lord Rockville's favourite dish sago wine, become uneatably cold ten minutes, he return home enjoy it!" Scarcely she finished speaking, door opened Lord Rockville walked majestically room. There something different usual his manner appearance, however, Harry Laura exchanged looks astonishment; his neckcloth loose--his face excessively red--and his hand shook, he breathed hard, he might heard porter's lodge. Lady Rockville gazed amazement she saw, asked he chose supper; Lord Rockville tried speak, words died his lips, he could point silence sago wine. "What world happened evening, Lord?" exclaimed Lady Rockville, unable restrain her curiosity moment longer. "I never saw way before! Your eyes perfectly blood-shot--your dress strangely disordered--and seem hot fatigued! Tell me!--what matter?" "Nothing!" answered Lord Rockville, drawing up, he tried look grander graver ever, though his Lordship could help panting breath--putting his hands his sides--and wiping his forehead his pocket-handkerchief agony fatigue. Harry observed time, eagerly intently cat watches bird tree. He saw something extraordinary occurred, he began hopes really thing he wished; because, seeing Lord Rockville perfectly safe, he would grudged pretty considerable fright his friend bull. At last, unable longer control his impatience, Harry started his chair, gazing earnestly Lord Rockville, his eyes almost sprung sockets, he rubbed his hands ecstacy, saying, "I guess you have seen bull? Oh! I sure did! Pray tell us have? Did he run you,--and run away?" Lord Rockville tried he ever done his life look grave, would do. Gradually his face relaxed smile, till last he burst loud peals laughter, joined heartily Harry, Laura, Lady Rockville. Nobody recovered gravity rest evening, whenever tried think talk quietly anything else, Harry Laura sure burst forth upon subject, even safely stowed beds night, laughed sleep idea Lord Rockville obliged, all, run away "most respectable, quiet, well-disposed animal, "THE MAD BULL!" CHAPTER VIII. THE BROKEN KEY. First he moved his right leg, Then he moved his left leg, Then he said, "I pardon beg," And sat upon his seat. "Oh! uncle David! uncle David!" cried Laura, arrived Holiday House, "I would jump carriage window joy see again; persons passing street might surprised!" "Not all! They quite accustomed see people jumping windows joy, whenever I appear." "We much tell you," exclaimed Harry Laura, seizing hold hand, "we hardly know begin!" "Ladies gentlemen! If talk once, I must get new pair ears! So particularly miserable Holiday House?" "No! no! uncle David! think much happiness world," answered Laura, eagerly. "The last two days could nothing play laugh, and"---- "And grow fat! Why! look well fed, fit killing! I shall obliged shut two three days, without anything eat, done pet lap-dogs, getting corpulent gouty." "Then shall like bears living paws," replied Harry, "and uncle David! I would rather that, glutton like Peter Grey. He went cheap shop lately, old cheese-cakes sold half-price, greedily devoured nearly dozen, thinking dead flies scattered top currants, till Frank shewed his mistake!" "Frank let eat peace! There accounting tastes. I knew lady liked swallow spiders! She used crack eat greatest delight, whenever she could catch one." "Oh! horrid woman! That even worse grandmama's story Dr. Manvers dined dish mice, fried crumbs bread!" "You know old proverb, Harry, 'one man's meat another man's poison.' The Persians disgusted eating lobsters; Hindoos think us scarcely fit exist, live beef; equally amazed Chinese devouring dog pies, birds'-nest soup. You turn nose French liking frogs; think us ten times worse singed sheep's head, oat cakes, haggis." "That reminds me," said Lady Harriet, "that Charles X. lived he called 'dear Canongate,' His Majesty heard say, he tried every sort Scotch goose, 'the solan goose, wild goose, tame goose; best goose all, hag-goose.'" "Very polite, indeed, adopt national taste completely," observed uncle David, smiling. "When regiment quartered Spain, officer ours, great epicure, quite complaisant, used say country scarcely fit live in, customary dress almost every dish sugar. At last, one day, rage, he ordered eggs brought shells dinner, saying, 'that thing cook cannot possibly spoil.' We played trick, however, like would done, Harry, similar occasion. I secretly put pounded sugar salt-cellar, he tasted his first mouthful, seen look fury he sprung his seat, exclaiming, 'the barbarians eat sugar even eggs!'" "That would country travel in," said Harry. "I could live barrel sugar; little pony, Tom Thumb, would happy accompany there, he likes anything sweet." "All animals opinion. I remember famous rider, Ducrow, telling brother-officer mine, way he gains much influence his horses, merely bribing sugar. They may managed way like children, quite aware, taken punishment restive." "Oh! beautiful horses Ducrow's! How often I think since there!" exclaimed Harry. "They quite like fairies, fine arched necks, long tails!" "I never heard fairy long tail, Master Harry; perhaps course travels may seen thing." "How I like ride upon Tom Thumb, Ducrow's way, toe saddle!" "Fine doings indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Crabtree, entered room moment. "Have forgotten already, Master Harry, many nursery plates broke one day I out, trying copy foolish Indian juggler, tossed his plates air, twirled his thumb! There must nonsense; neck broke fall Tom Thumb, doctor I know mend again. Remember terrible tumble Jessy last year!" "You always speaking little overturn, Mrs. Crabtree; worth recollecting week! Did never see man thrown his horse before?" "A man horse indeed!" said uncle David, laughing, he looked Harry. "You charger hardly large enough toy-shop; must grow little more, Captain Gulliver, fit dragoon regiment." Harry Laura stayed quietly home several weeks return Holiday House, attending busily lessons, uncle David said he felt much afraid going pair little wonders, would die much learning. "You taken ill multiplication table day, confined bed violent fit geography! Pray take care yourselves, devour three books once," said Major Graham one day, entering room note his hand. "Here invitation I suppose busy accept, perhaps I might well send apology; eh, Harry?" Down dropped lesson-books upon floor, sprung Harry ecstacy delight. "An invitation! Oh! I like invitation much! Pray tell us it!" "Perhaps invitation spend month Dr. Lexicon. What would say that? They breakfast upon Latin grammars school, dish real French verbs, smothered onions, dinner every day." "But downright earnest, uncle David! going?" "Must I tell you? Well! good-natured old lady, Mrs. Darwin, intends taking large party children next week, her carriage, pass ten days Ivy Lodge, charming country house twenty miles off, enjoy perfect happiness. I wish I could ground little boy myself, occasion! Poor good woman! life she lead! There one little drawback delight, I almost afraid announce." "What that, uncle David?" asked Harry, looking nothing nature could ever make grave again. "Are bite noses return?" "Not exactly; somebody party you. Mrs. Darwin heard certain children become occasionally rather unmanageable! I cannot think be, certainly nobody ever saw; she requested Mrs. Crabtree follow mail-coach." Harry Laura looked glass cold water thrown faces, mentioned; soon forgot every little vexation, burst joy, when, days afterwards, Mrs. Darwin stopped door pick up, curious-looking carriage ever seen. It large open car, round bird's nest, perfectly crowded children, nobody could supposed room left even doll; Mrs. Darwin said whatever number people came in, always accommodation one more; really proved case, Harry Laura soon elbowed way seats set off, waving handkerchiefs Major Graham, helped pack in, stood smiling door. As large vehicle drawn one horse, proceeded slowly; Mrs. Darwin amused children several diverting stories, gave grand luncheon carriage; which, threw left, wrapped old newspaper, people breaking stones road, feeling quite delighted see surprise joy poor labourers opened parcel. In short, everybody became sorry diverting journey finished, drove up, last, gate tall old house, looked built year one. The walls thick, quite mouldy age. Indeed, wonder was, Ivy Lodge still roof upon head, every thing looked tottering decayed. The servants old; white-headed butler opened door, looked frail gloomy house; long, old walls Ivy Lodge rung echoed sounds mirth joy. It seemed built purpose hide seek; rooms invisible doors, closets cut walls, great old chests people might buried alive year, without found out. The gardens, too, perfectly enchanting. Such arbours take strawberries cream in! summer-houses, drank tea doors every evening! Here saw prodigious eagle, fastened ground chain, looking dull, melancholy creature world; Harry wished poor bird might liberated, thought delightful would stand see soaring away his native skies. "Yes! large slice raw meat his beak!" said Peter Grey, always thinking eating. "I dare say he lives much better here, he would killing his mutton clouds there, taking his chance dead horse sea-shore occasionally." Harry Peter particularly amused Mrs. Darwin's curious collection pets. There black swans red bills, swimming gracefully pond close window, ready rush forward shortest notice, morsel bread. The lop-eared rabbits also surprised them, ears hanging ground, interested see pair carrier-pigeons could carry letters well postman. Mrs. Darwin showed tumbler pigeons too, performed summerset air flew, horsemen dragoon pigeons, trumpeters pouters, till Peter Grey last begged see pigeons made pigeon-pies, cow gave butter-milk; he likewise anxious leave bring his fishing-rod drawing-room, try whether he could catch one beautiful gold-fish swam large glass globe, saying he thought might perhaps good eat breakfast. Mrs. Darwin pet lamb she exceedingly fond of, followed her everywhere, Harry, fond little creature, said he wished plan could invented hinder ever growing great fat vulgar sheep; he thought white mice old animals grown grey years. There donkies children ride upon, Mrs. Darwin boat held whole party, sail in, round pond, she hung swing seemed fly high house, swung upon, allowed shake fruit-trees, eat whatever came ears; often rained apples pears gardens Ivy Lodge, Peter seemed never tire joke; indeed apple-trees sad life long he remained. Peter told Mrs. Darwin he "a patent appetite," always ready every occasion; good lady became fond stuffing children hours, even he felt little puzzled sometimes dispose she heaped upon his plate, Harry Laura, far greedy, became perfectly wearied hearing gong. The whole party assembled eight every morning, partake porridge butter-milk, which, ten, breakfasted Mrs. Darwin tea, muffins, sweetmeats. They drove round open car, bathe sea, return which, luncheon always ready, concluding that, might pass interval till dinner among fruit-trees. They never could eat enough please Mrs. Darwin dinner; tea followed, substantial plan; supper consisted poached eggs, maid desired put biscuit every visitor's pillow, case young people hungry night, Mrs. Darwin said she starved school herself, she little girl, wished nobody ever suffer, she done, hunger. The good lady anxious everything exactly children liked it, sometimes Laura felt quite loss say do. One day, cracked her egg-she will breakfast, Mrs. Darwin peeped anxiously her shoulder, saying, "I hope, dear! egg right?" "Most excellent indeed!" "Is quite fresh?" "Perfectly! I dare say laid minute boiled!" "I seen eggs much larger that." "Yes! I believe rather coarse,--at least think so, Mrs. Crabtree gives us turkey egg dinner." "If prefer small, perhaps would like guinea-fowl's egg?" "Thank you! one I like them." "It looks rather over-done! If think so, could get another minute!" "No! better well boiled!" "Then probably enough done. Some people like quite hard, I could easily pop slop-basin another minute." "I really obliged you, could improved." "Do take salt egg?" "No, I thank you!" "A grains would improve it!" "If say so, I dare say will." "Ah! I afraid put much! pray get another!" This long-continued attack upon her egg much Laura's gravity, appeared minutes violent fit coughing, ending burst laughter, she hastily finished remained it, thus ended discussion. In midst happiness, children thought every succeeding day fault short, Harry even planned Peter stop clock altogether, see whether time would stand still, nobody ever thought moment anything joy; yet sad sudden distress awaited Mrs. Darwin. One forenoon she received letter seemed hastily awkwardly folded,--the seal one side, surrounded stray drops red wax,--the direction appeared sadly blotted, top written large letters, words, "To delivered immediately." When Mrs. Darwin hurriedly tore open strange-looking letter, she found came her housekeeper town, announce dreadful event her sister, Lady Barnet, day seized apoplectic fit, thought point death, therefore hoped Mrs. Darwin would lose hour returning town, she might present melancholy occasion. The shock hearing news great, poor Mrs. Darwin could speak it, trying compose herself minutes, she went play-room, told children that, reasons she could explain, must get ready return home hour, car would door journey. Nothing could exceed surprise hearing Mrs. Darwin make unexpected proposal. At first Peter Grey thought she speaking jest, said he would prefer she ordered balloon travel in, morning; appeared Mrs. Darwin really earnest pleasant visit soon, Harry's face grew perfectly red passion, he said loud angry voice, "Grandmama allowed stay till Friday!--and I invited stay,--and I go anywhere else!" "Oh fie, Master Harry!" said Mrs. Crabtree. "Do talk so! You ought know better! I shall soon teach you, however, bid!" Saying words, she stretched her hand seize violent hold him, Harry dipped escaped. Quickly opening door, he ran, half joke half earnest, full speed two pairs stairs, followed closely Mrs. Crabtree, terrible rage, especially she saw piece fun Harry thought fatiguing race. A door happened standing wide open second landing-place, which, observed Harry, he darted in, slammed Mrs. Crabtree's face, locking double-locking it, secure his safety, he sat empty apartment enjoy his victory peace. When people begin grow self-willed rebellious, impossible guess end! Harry might easily led right first, one reasoned spoken kindly, he really sort do not-care-a-button humour, scarcely minded he next. As long Mrs. Crabtree continued scold rave behind door, Harry grew harder harder; length good old lady, Mrs. Darwin herself, arrived stairs, represented ungrateful he was, his power please her, she taken much pains make happy. This brought little rebel round moment, he became quite sensible his misconduct, resolved immediately submit. Accordingly, Harry tried open door, but, easily done cannot sometimes undone, turned case occasion, as, his exertions, key would turn lock! Harry tried first one way, another. He twisted his whole strength, till his face became perfectly scarlet effort, vain! At last he put poker handle key, thinking clever plan, quite sure succeed, desperate struggle, unfortunate key broke two, nobody could possibly open door! After provoking accident happened, Harry felt bad boy he been, he burst tears, called key-hole beg Mrs. Darwin's pardon, Mrs. Crabtree scolded key-hole return, till Harry shrunk away cannonading begun his ear. Meantime, Mrs. Darwin hurried off, racking her brains think best done deliver prisoner, since time could lost, she might perhaps get town night, car expected every minute, come round travellers. The gardener said he thought might possible find ladders, which, tied one another, would perhaps reach high window, Harry appeared, he could easily scramble down; servants made haste fetch could find, borrow could see, till great many collected. These joined together strongly ropes, last reared wall, great disappointment Mrs. Darwin, ladder appeared yard a-half short! What done? The obliging gardener mounted top his ladder, Harry leaned far window, he seemed danger falling out, still reach one another, single person could guess plan tried next. At length Harry called loudly gardener, "Hollo! Mr. King Spades! If I let drop gently window, could catch arms?" "Mr. Harry! Mr. Harry! dare!" cried Mrs. Crabtree, shaking her fist him. "You will broken pieces like tea-pot, you will made flat pancake! Stay are! Do ye hear!" But Harry seemed suddenly grown deaf, half out--fixing his fingers firmly ledge window, slowly dropping his legs downwards. "Oh Harry! killed!" screamed Laura. "Stop! stop! Harry, mad? nobody stop him?" But nobody could stop him, for, high everybody's head, Harry his way, nearly hanging altogether window, he stopped single minute, called out, "Do frightened, Laura! I behaved ill, deserve worst happen. If I break head, save Mrs. Crabtree trouble breaking me, I come down." The gardener balanced steadily upper step ladder, spread his arms out, Harry slowly let drop. Laura tried look without screaming out, might startled him, scene became frightful, she closed her eyes, put her hands her face turned away, her heart beat violently, might almost heard. Even Mrs. Crabtree clasped her hands agony alarm, Mrs. Darwin put her pocket handkerchief, could look another moment. An awful pause took place, which, feather falling ground would startled them, suddenly loud shout Peter Grey children, gaily echoed top ladder, made Laura venture look up, Harry safe gardener's arms, soon helped ground, he immediately asked pardon everybody fright he given them. There time half scold Mrs. Crabtree, Mrs. Darwin's car waiting time; Harry said she might owing rest, future occasion. "Yes! hundred lashes besides!" added Peter Grey, laughing. "Pray touch well, Mrs. Crabtree, it. There law cruelty boys!" This put Mrs. Crabtree rage, she followed Peter perfect hail-storm angry words, till last, joke, he put Mrs. Darwin's umbrella screen himself, immediately afterwards car drove slowly off. When uncle David heard adventures Ivy Lodge, he listened attentively "the confessions Master Harry Graham," shook his head serious manner concluded, saying, "I always thought boys like cats, nine lives least! You hung basket, Harry, unruly boys South Sea Islands, young gentlemen left dangling air days together without possibility escape!" "I would care compared teazed worried Mrs. Crabtree. I really wish, uncle David, Dr. Bell would order never scolded more! It bad me! I generally feel odd sort over-all-ish-ness soon she begins; I getting big now, thing birch-rod like Frank. How pleasant grown-up man, uncle David, are, sitting day club hat head, nothing look window. That I call happiness!" "But upon time, Harry," said Lady Harriet, "when I stopped carriage uncle David club, he middle yawn window, he nearly dislocated his jaw! quite alarming see him, he told great secret, longest tiresome hours his life are, he nothing particular do." "Now, moment, I nothing particular do," said Major Graham, "therefore I shall tell wonderful story, children, liking idle busy, must find moral yourselves." "A story! story!" cried Harry Laura, ecstacy delight, knee uncle David's, belonged themselves, scrambled places, exclaiming, "Now let bad boys, giants, fairies!" CHAPTER IX. UNCLE DAVID'S NONSENSICAL STORY ABOUT GIANTS AND FAIRIES. "Pie-crust pastry-crust, wall; The windows made black-puddings white, And slated pancakes--you never saw like!" In days yore, children clever, good sensible people now! Lessons considered rather plague, sugar-plums still demand--holidays continued yet fashion--and toys made teach mathematics, story-books give instruction chemistry navigation. These strange times, existed period, idle, greedy, naughty boy, never hear present day. His papa mama were----no matter who,----and he lived, matter where. His name Master No-book, he seemed think his eyes made nothing stare windows, his mouth purpose eat. This young gentleman hated lessons like mustard, brought tears his eyes, school-hours, he sat gazing his books, pretending busy, his mind wandered away wish impatiently his dinner, consider he could get nicest pies, pastry, ices, jellies, he smacked his lips thoughts them. I think he must first cousin Peter Grey, perfectly certain. Whenever Master No-book spoke, always ask something, might continually hear say, whining tone voice, "Papa! may I take piece cake? Aunt Sarah! give apple? Mama! send whole plum-pudding!" Indeed, frequently he get permission gormandize, naughty glutton helped without leave. Even his dreams like his waking hours, he often horrible night-mare lessons, thinking he smothered Greek Lexicons, pelted school shower English Grammars, one night, he fancied sitting devour enormous plum-cake, sudden became transformed Latin Dictionary! One afternoon, Master No-book, played truant day school, lolling his mama's best sofa drawing-room, his leather boots tucked satin cushions, nothing suck oranges, nothing think much sugar put upon them, suddenly event took place filled astonishment. A sound soft music stole room, becoming louder louder longer he listened, till length, moments afterwards, large hole burst open wall his room, stepped his presence, two magnificent fairies, arrived castle air, pay visit. They travelled way purpose conversation Master No-book, immediately introduced ceremonious manner. The fairy Do-nothing gorgeously dressed wreath flaming gas round her head, robe gold tissue, necklace rubies, bouquet her hand, glittering diamonds. Her cheeks rouged eyes,--her teeth set gold, her hair brilliant purple; short, fine fashionable looking fairy never seen drawing-room before. The fairy Teach-all, followed next, simply dressed white muslin, bunches natural flowers her light brown hair, she carried her hand neat small books, Master No-book looked shudder aversion. The two fairies informed him, often invited large parties children, spend time palaces, lived quite opposite direction, necessary young guests choose would best visit first; therefore come inquire Master No-book, he thought would agreeable accompany present occasion. "In house," said fairy Teach-all, speaking sweet smile, soft, pleasing voice, "you shall taught find pleasure every sort exertion, I delight activity diligence. My young friends rise seven every morning, amuse working beautiful garden flowers,--rearing whatever fruit wish eat,--visiting among poor,--associating pleasantly together,--studying arts sciences,--and learning know world live, fulfil purposes brought it. In short, amusements tend useful object, either improvement good others, grow wiser, better, happier every day remain Palace Knowledge." "But Castle Needless I live," interrupted fairy Do-nothing, rudely pushing her companion aside, angry contemptuous look, "we never think exerting anything. You may put head pocket, hands sides long choose stay. No one ever even asked question, he may spared trouble answering. We lead fashionable life imagined, nobody speaks anybody! Each visitors quite exclusive, sits his back many company possible, comfortable arm-chair imagined. There, good take trouble wishing anything, yours, without even turning eye round look comes from. Dresses provided magnificent kind, go themselves, without smallest annoyance either buttons strings,--games play without effort thought,--and dishes dressed French cook, smoking hot hot nose, morning till night,--while rain have, either made cherry brandy, lemonade, lavender water,--and winter generally snows iced-punch hour forenoon." Nobody need told fairy Master No-book preferred; quite charmed his good fortune receiving agreeable invitation, he eagerly gave his hand splendid new acquaintance, promised much pleasure ease, gladly proceeded, carriage lined velvet, stuffed downy pillows, drawn milk-white swans, magnificent residence Castle Needless, lighted thousand windows day, million lamps every night. Here Master No-book enjoyed constant holiday constant feast, beautiful lady, covered jewels, ready tell stories morning till night, servants waited pick his playthings fell, draw his purse his pocket-handkerchief he wished use them. Thus Master No-book lay dozing hours days rich embroidered cushions, never stirring his place, admiring view trees covered richest burned almonds, grottoes sugar-candy, jet d'eau champagne, wide sea tasted sugar instead salt, bright clear pond, filled gold-fish, let caught whenever he pleased. Nothing could complete, yet, strange say, Master No-book seem particularly happy! This appears exceedingly unreasonable, much trouble taken please him; truth is, every day he became fretful peevish. No sweetmeats worth trouble eating, nothing pleasant play at, end he wished possible sleep day, well night. Not hundred miles fairy Do-nothing's palace, lived cruel monster called giant Snap- them-up, looked, he stood up, like tall steeple great church, raising his head high, he could peep loftiest mountains, obliged climb ladder comb his hair. Every morning regularly, prodigiously great giant walked round world breakfast appetite, which, he made tea large lake, used sea slop-basin, boiled his kettle Mount Vesuvius. He lived great style, his dinners magnificent, consisting often elephant roasted whole, ostrich patties, tiger smothered onions, stewed lions, whale soup; side-dish his greatest favourite consisted little boys, fat possible, fried crumbs bread, plenty pepper salt. No children well fed, good condition eating, fairy Do-nothing's garden, particular friend great Snap- them-up's, sometimes laughingly said she would give license, call her garden his "preserve," she allowed help himself, whenever he pleased, many her visitors he chose, without taking trouble even count them, return extreme civility, giant frequently invited her dinner. Snap- them-up's favourite sport was, see many brace little boys he could bag morning; passing along streets, he peeped drawing-rooms without occasion get upon tiptoe, picked every young gentleman idly looking windows, even occasionally playing truant school, busy children seemed always somehow quite his reach. One day, Master No-book felt even lazy, idle, miserable ever, he lay beside perfect mountain toys cakes, wondering wish next, hating sight everything everybody. At last he gave loud yawn weariness disgust, his jaw nearly fell joint, he sighed deeply, giant Snap- them-up heard sound he passed along road breakfast, instantly stepped garden, his glass his eye, see matter. Immediately observing large, fat, over-grown boy, round dumpling, lying bed roses, he gave cry delight, followed gigantic peal laughter, heard three miles off, picking Master No-book his finger his thumb, pinch nearly broke his ribs, he carried rapidly towards his castle, fairy Do-nothing laughingly shook her head he passed, saying, "That little man great credit!--he fed week, fat already prize ox! What dainty morsel he be! When dine to-day, case I time look upon you?" On reaching home, giant immediately hung Master No-book hair his head, prodigious hook larder, first taken large lumps nasty suet, forcing his throat make become still fatter, stirring fire, he might almost melted heat, make his liver grow larger. On shelf quite near, Master No-book perceived dead bodies six boys, he remembered seen fattening fairy Do-nothing's garden, he recollected rejoiced thoughts leading long, useless, idle life, one please themselves. The enormous cook seized hold Master No-book, brandishing her knife, aspect horrible determination, intending kill him, he took trouble screaming kicking desperate manner, giant turned gravely round said, pigs considered much greater dainty whipped death killed way, he meant see whether children might improved also; therefore she might leave great hog boy till he time try experiment, especially his appetite would improved exercise. This dreadful prospect unhappy prisoner; meantime prolonged his life hours, he immediately hung larder, left himself. There, torture mind body,--like fish upon hook,--the wretched boy began last reflect seriously upon his former ways, consider happy home he might had, he could satisfied business pleasure succeeding other, like day night, lessons might come in, pleasant sauce his play-hours, his play-hours sauce his lessons. In midst many reflections, sensible, though rather late. Master No-book's attention became attracted sound many voices laughing, talking, singing, caused turn his eyes new direction, when, first time, he observed fairy Teach-all's garden lay upon beautiful sloping bank far off. There crowd merry, noisy, rosy-cheeked boys, busily employed, seemed happier day long; poor Master No-book watched his miserable hours, envying enjoyment raked flower-borders, gathered fruit, carried baskets vegetables poor, worked carpenters' tools, drew pictures, shot bows arrows, played cricket, sat sunny arbours learning tasks, talking agreeably together, till length, dinner-bell rung, whole party sat merrily hearty appetites, cheerful good-humour, entertainment plain roast meat pudding, fairy Teach-all presided herself, helped her guests moderately, much good each. Large tears rolled cheeks Master No-book watching scene; remembering he known best him, he might happy happiest excellent boys, instead suffering ennui weariness, he done fairy Do-nothing's, ending miserable death; his attention soon alarmingly roused hearing giant Snap- them-up conversation his cook, said, he wished good large dish scolloped children dinner, would necessary catch more, he already provided would scarcely mouthful. As giant kept fashionable hours, always waited dinner till nine of the clock, still plenty time; so, loud grumble trouble, he seized large basket his hand, set rapid pace towards fairy Teach-all's garden. It seldom Snap- them-up ventured think foraging direction, he never succeeded carrying single captive enclosure, well fortified bravely defended; occasion, desperately hungry, he felt bold lion, walked, outstretched hands, straight towards fairy Teach-all's dinner-table, taking prodigious strides, he seemed almost he would trample himself. A cry consternation arose instant tremendous giant appeared; usual occasions, he made attempt before, dreadful battle took place. Fifty active little boys bravely flew upon enemy, armed dinner knives, looked like nest hornets, stinging every direction, till he roared pain, would run away, fairy Teach-all, seeing his intention, rushed forward carving knife, brandishing high her head, she courageously stabbed heart! If great mountain fallen earth, would seemed like nothing comparison giant Snap- them-up, crushed two three houses powder beneath him, upset several fine monuments made people remembered ever; would seemed scarcely worth mentioning, still greater event occurred occasion, less death fairy Do-nothing, indolently looking great battle, without taking trouble interfere, even care victorious, but, also lazy running away, giant fell, his sword came violent stroke her head, she instantly expired. Thus, luckily whole world, fairy Teach-all got possession immense property, she proceeded without delay make best use her power. In first place, however, she lost time liberating Master No-book his hook larder, gave lecture activity, moderation, good conduct, he never afterwards forgot; astonishing see change took place immediately his whole thoughts actions. From hour, Master No-book became diligent, active, happy boy fairy Teach-all's garden; returning home month afterwards, he astonished masters school his extraordinary reformation. The difficult lessons pleasure him,--he scarcely ever stirred without book his hand,--never lay sofa again,--would scarcely even sit chair back it, preferred three-legged stool,--detested holidays,--never thought exertion trouble,--preferred climbing top hill creeping round bottom,--always ate plainest food small quantities,--joined Temperance Society!-and never tasted morsel till he worked hard got appetite. Not long this, old uncle, formerly ashamed Master No-book's indolence gluttony, became pleased wonderful change, that, his death, he left magnificent estate, desiring he take his name; therefore, instead longer one No-book family, he called Sir Timothy Bluestocking,--a pattern whole country round, good he every one, especially his extraordinary activity, appearing he could twenty things once. Though generally good-natured agreeable, Sir Timothy occasionally observed violent passion, laying his walking-stick terrific manner, beating little boys within inch lives; inquiry, invariably appears he found lazy, idle, greedy, industrious boys parish sent get employment him, he assures far happier breaking stones road, sitting idly drawing-room nothing do. Sir Timothy cares little poetry general; following his favourite verses, he placed chimney-piece school he built poor, every scholar obliged, day he begins his education, learn them:-- Some people complain nothing do, And time passes slowly away; They saunter object view, And long end day. In vain trifles toys desire, For nothing truly enjoy; Of trifles, toys, amusements tire, For want useful employ. Although transgression ground accursed, Yet gratefully man must allow, It Was really blessing doom'd first, To live sweat his brow. Nursery Rhymes. "Thank you, hundred times over, uncle David!" said Harry, story finished. "I shall take care found hanging day hook larder! Certainly, Frank, must spent month good fairy; I hope she day invite made scholar too, Laura I still belong No-book family." "It important. Harry, choose best course beginning," observed Lady Harriet. "Good bad habits grow stronger stronger every minute, additional string tied daily, keep us road walked day before; mistake path duty first, find hourly increasing difficulty turning round." "But grandmama!" said Frank, "you put finger-posts direct us right; whenever I see 'no passage way,' shall wheel directly." "As Mrs. Crabtree tapped door yet, I shall describe progress wise foolish man, see Harry would prefer copying," replied Lady Harriet, smiling. "The fool begins, he young, hating lessons, lying long bed, spending his money trash. Any books he consent read, never true important; he wastes his time thoughts silly stories never could happened. Thus he neglects learn done, thought, great good men really lived former times, even his Bible, he one, grows dusty shelf. After bad beginning, he grows useful interesting knowledge; therefore his whole talk describe his horses, his dogs, his guns, his exploits; boasting high wall his horse leap over, number little birds he shoot day, many bottles wine he swallow without tumbling table. Thus, 'glorying his shame,' he thinks wonderful person, knowing men born much better things merely find selfish pleasure amusement themselves. Presently he grows old, gouty, infirm--no longer able prodigious achievements; therefore his great delight is, sit his feet upon fender, club day, telling famous rider, shooter, drinker, he long ago; nobody cares hear old stories; therefore he called 'proser,' every person avoids him. It wonder man talks himself, he never read thought one else. But length his precious time wasted, his last hour comes, he nothing look back upon life folly guilt. He sees one around loves him, weep his grave; he looks forward, towards eternal world he never prepared enter, he knows nothing." "What terrible picture, grandmama!" said Frank, rather gravely. "I hope many people like that, would sad meet them. Now pray let us pleasanter description sort persons would like Harry become." "The first foundation is, already know, Frank, pray may put right course kept it, sinful weak good thing. Then feeling full trust Divine assistance, must begin end every day studying Bible, merely reading it, carefully endeavouring understand obey contains. Our leisure bestowed reading wiser better people ourselves, keep us humble instructs understandings, thus shall fitted associate persons whose society even better books. Christians enlightened sanctified knowledge good things, show us example carefully using time, valuable earthly possessions. If waste money, may perhaps get more--if lose health, may restored--but time squandered folly, must hereafter answered for, never regained. Whatever station life, waste none thoughts upon fancying much better might acted person's place, see duties belong station live, requires activity diligence. When called give account stewardship, let us confess last wasted one talent, wished trusted ten; let us prepare render given us, joy thankfulness, perfectly satisfied best place life God appoints, He guide us safe peaceful end." "Yes!" added Major Graham. "You two eyes minds well bodies. With one see good agreeable lot--with see unpleasant disappointing, may generally choose eye keep open. Some friends always peevishly look troubles vexations endure, might turn good, considering every circumstance sent hand, merciful purpose--to make us better happier hereafter." "Well! dear children," said Lady Harriet, "it time retiring Bedfordshire; good night." "If please, grandmama! yet," asked Harry, anxiously. "Give us five minutes longer!" "And morning want remain five minutes bed. That way people learn keep dreadfully late hours last, Harry! I knew one rich old gentleman formerly, always wished sit little later every night, get little later morning, till length, he ended hiring set servants rise nine evening, he himself, remain bed day." "People regulate sleep conscientiously," added Major Graham, "so waste little time possible; good king George III. set us example, he remarked, six hours night quite enough man--seven hours woman, eight fool. Or perhaps, Harry, might like live Sir William Jones' rule: 'Six hours read, soothing slumber seven, Ten world allot--and Heaven.'" CHAPTER X. THE ILLUMINATION. A neighbour's house he would slyly pass, And throw stone break glass. One fine morning Charlotte Square, Peter Grey persuaded party his companions spend money cakes sugar-plums, make splendid entertainment trees, sit like horde gypsies, amuse telling fortunes other. Harry Laura one Betty, gladly joined group nursery-maids distance, leaving devices; upon rushed Peter offered assistance, subscribing pocket-money, begging set forth obtain provisions well himself. Neither Harry Laura cared eating trash collected occasion, would quite well pleased distribute among companions; enjoyed extremely bustle arranging elegant déjeuné "_disjune_," Peter called it. Harry gathered leaves trees represent plates, Peter arranged fruit sweetmeats he purchased, placed benches together table, borrowed Laura's white India shawl table-cloth. "It looks like grand public dinner saw Assembly Rooms one day!" exclaimed Harry, ecstacy admiration. "We must speeches toasts like real gentlemen officers. Peter! make fine oration, full compliments me, I shall say something wonderful you, Laura must beat upon table stick, show she agrees observe praise other." "Or suppose take names great personages," added Peter, "I shall Duke Wellington, Laura, must Joseph Hume, Harry, Sir Francis Burdett, may seem different possible; comes usher black rod disperse us all! Mrs. Crabtree hurrying square, her gown flaming rage! matter! she must smelled sugar-plums mile off! one comfort is, Harry Laura taken away, shall fewer people divide cakes among, I could devour every one them, share." Before Peter finished speaking, Mrs. Crabtree come close table, without waiting utter word, even scold, she twitched Laura's shawl her hand, thus scattered whole feast every direction ground, she trampled sugar-plums cakes earth, saying, "I knew would be, soon I saw whose company in, Master Harry! Peter Grey father mischief! he ought put monkey's cage GEOlogical gardens! I would maid, Master Grey, hundred a-year." "You would need buy thrashing machine immediately," said Peter, laughing; "what fine time I it! would scarcely allow me, I suppose, blow porridge! long would take you, Mrs. Crabtree, make quite perfectly good boy me? Perhaps month, think? make good Frank, might possibly require six weeks." "Six weeks!" answered Mrs. Crabtree; "six years, sixty, would short. You like Mr. Frank shilling guinea, wax light dip. If news told good boy single day, _statutes_ streets would come running along see wonder. No! no! I observed many surprising things day, great pyramuses Egypt turn upside turn like Mr. Frank." Some days adventure Harry Laura's, arrived newspapers London containing accounts great battle fought abroad. On occasion British troops course performed prodigies valour, completely conquered enemy, consequence which, ordered government, that, every town, every village, every house throughout whole kingdom, grand illumination. Neither Harry Laura ever heard thing illumination before, full curiosity know like; faces became lighted joy, Major Graham described would see crowds candles flaming every window, tar-barrels blazing every hill, flambeaux glaring doors, transparencies, fire-works, coloured lamps shining streets. "How delightful! walking dark see it," cried Harry; "that best all! oh! whole holiday! I hardly know whether I right wits, wrong wits, joy! I wish gained victory every day!" "What warrior would be, Harry! Cæsar nothing you," said Frank. "We might satisfied one good battle year, considering many killed wounded." "Yes, I hope wounded soldiers recover." "Or get pensions," added uncle David. "It grand sight, Frank, see whole nation rejoicing once! In general, walk meet fifty persons street, thinking fifty different things, intent business his own, occasion one mind one heart." Frank Harry allowed nail dozen little candlesticks upon window house, delighted exceedingly, then, every pane glass, placed tall candle, impatiently longing time illuminated. Laura allowed carry match, assist lighting them, excess her joy, she nearly made bonfire herself, her frock took fire, would soon blaze, Frank hastily seized large rug rolled round her. In every house within sight, servants children seen hurrying burning matches, hundreds lights blazed moment, looking houses town taken fire. "Such waste candles!" said Mrs. Crabtree, angrily; "cannot people happy dark!" "No, Mrs. Crabtree!" answered Frank, laughing. "They cannot happy dark! People's spirits always exact proportion number lights. If ever feel dull one candle, light another; do, try third, fourth, till feel merry cheerful. We must let candle-snuffer to-night, putting out. You would snuff sun itself, save shilling." "The windows might perhaps broken," added Laura; "for whatever pane glass exhibit candle, stone sent it. Harry says mob glaziers, break purpose mend damage next day, paid handsomely doing." There many happy, joyous faces, seen evening streets, admiring splendid illumination; merriest party all, composed Frank, Harry, Laura, command uncle David, lately suffered severe fit gout; seemed left night, honour great victory, he appeared quite much boy either his two companions. For many hours walked streets, gazing glittering windows, looked constellation stars come night adorn them; others filled beautiful pictures Britannia carrying world her shoulders; Mars showering wreaths laurel Duke Wellington, victory sitting his feet, fame blowing trumpet his ear. Harry thought paintings finer he ever seen before, stood moments entranced admiration, beholding representation red, blue, yellow, black, Europe, Asia, Africa, America, homage St. George mounted dragon, breathed fire smoke like steam-boat. Nothing, however, occasioned party burst delightful surprise, first beheld line blazing windows mile long, bottom Canongate highest pinnacle Castle, seemed almost meet stars shining above, perpetual glory. "You see," remarked Major Graham, he pointed his young companions, "there fit emblem difference earth heaven. These lights nearer brighter us present; blazed glittered one little hour, come end; above, see dimly now, continue shine ages generations hereafter, till time more." Occasionally, progress, Harry felt indignant observe houses perfectly dark; whether family sick, town, whatever reason might be, he scarcely became sorry frequent crash might heard, mob, determined way night, aimed showers stones offending windows, till frames seemed danger broken. At last uncle David led his joyous little party Castle Street, light seen, every blind seemed carefully closed. A crowd assembled, evident intention attack melancholy houses, Major Graham suddenly caught hold Harry's arm, observing he privately picked large stone, he act throwing his whole force one defenceless windows. And whole party stood stock still, uncle David said angry serious voice, "Harry! heedless, mischievous boy! never learn consider moment wrong? I exceedingly displeased this! What business whether house lighted not?" "But, uncle David! surely wrong obey government, happy like everybody else! Besides, see mob break windows rate, matter I help them." "Then, reason, setting house fire, I suppose would assist conflagration, Harry. Your excuse bad one; hear I say house, let lesson rest life, never judge hastily, act rashly. The officer belonged, killed great battle abroad; rejoicing victory his bravery helped gain, his widow children weeping within walls, husband father lies buried foreign shore. Think contrast shouts joy must grief." "Oh, uncle David! sorry I am!" said Harry. "I deserve go home moment, see candle week. It wrong indeed. I shall walk way home, eyes shut, excuse me." "No, no, Harry! necessary! If eyes mind open, see acted amiss, try behave better future. When people happy themselves, apt forget others may distress, often feel quite surprised provoked appear melancholy; turn must come like theirs. Life made sunshine shadow, sent good, neither last, world, ever; borrow part joys, part sorrows, sympathy see know, moderate excess whatever portion life." At moment, mob, gradually increasing, gave tremendous shout, point throwing torrent stones dark, mournful house, made narrow escape Harry's vengeance, Major Graham, forgetting his gout, hastily sprung upon lamp-post, calling attention, he made speech crowd, telling brave Captain D---- died his country, covered wounds, his mourning family assembled house. Instantly mob became silent motionless turned stones; gradually stole away, downcast eyes, mournful countenances; believed riotous people, loudest fiercest first, afterwards stood top little street like sentinels, hour, warn every one passed, he go silently along, respect memory brave good officer. Not another shout heard neighbourhood night; many merry laugh suddenly checked reverence memory dead, sorrow living; spectators remarked, sigh melancholy reflection, men must ever join trembling mirth, even midst life death. "If feel much sorrow one officer his family, shows," said Frank, "what dreadful thing war is, costs lives thousands tens thousands every campaign, sickness fatigue, sources misery accompany every army." "Yes, Frank! yet scarcely year earth, world existed, without fighting country another, for, since time Cain killed Abel, men continually destroying other. Animals fight temporary irritation hungry, pride, ambition, folly every kind, caused men hate massacre other. Even religion caused fiercest bloody conflicts, though, understood obeyed ought be, great truths Scripture would produce peace earth, good-will among children men." The whole party standing minutes opposite post-office, looked like rainbow coloured lamps, Harry beginning, twentieth time, try he could count many were, Major Graham felt something twitching hold his coat pocket behind, wheeling suddenly round, he perceived little boy, much older Harry, darting rapidly another direction, carrying his purse pocket-handkerchief his hand. Being still rather lame, unable move fast, Major Graham could vociferate top his voice, "Stop thief! stop thief!" constable appeared sight, case seemed desperate, money lost ever, Frank observed also occurred, active spirit, he flew young thief, followed closely Harry. An eager race ensued, one street, another, marvellous rapidity, Frank evidently gaining ground, thief last became terrified, threw away purse, hoping thus end chase; neither his pursuers paused moment pick up, intent upon capturing little culprit himself. At length Frank sprung forward caught collar, fierce conflict ensued, young thief ingenious, he nearly slipped his arms his coat, would made his escape, leaving tattered garment hands, Harry observed trick, held hair, which, wig, he could easily throw off. At moment, large coarse ruffianly-looking man hurried party, evidently intending rescue little pick-pocket custody; Frank called loudly help, several police-officers sent Major Graham, came racing along street, springing rattles, vociferating, "Stop thief!" Now, boy struggled violently ever disentangle himself, Frank Harry grasped hold prisoner, couple Bow Street officers, till length tall fierce man thought time off, though he given Harry blow face, caused reel back, fall prostrate pavement. "There is brave little gentleman!" said one constables, helping up, another secured thief. "You ought knighted fighting well! This boy taken sad fellow! He broke his poor mother's heart year since his wicked ways, I long wished catch him. A weeks tread-mill now, may save gallows future." "He seems well practised his business," observed Major Graham. "I almost deserved; however, lose pocket-book bringing night much crowding confusion. Some lucky person richer, though I fear totally lost me." "But pocket-handkerchief, uncle David, mean she would tears misfortune," whispered Laura; "how lucky felt going!" "Yes, surprising too, trick cleverly executed! That little rascal might steal teeth one's head, without noticed! When I India, thieves expert really could draw sheets person sleeping bed, without disturbing his slumbers." "With me, person could that, I sleep soundly," observed Frank. "You might beat military drum ear, boy's sleeping rooms Sandhurst, would smallest effect. I scarcely think even gong would do!" "How different me," replied Laura. "Last night I awakened scratching mouse nibbling wainscoat, soon ran across face." "Then pray sleep to-night mouth open, piece toasted cheese it, catch mouse," said Major Graham. "That best trap I know!" "Uncle David," asked Frank, proceeded along street, "if hope wicked boy reformed, try taught better? Being young, he must learned older people steal." "Certainly he must! It melancholy know carefully mere children trained commit worst crimes, little mind young boy match cunning old, experienced villains like lead astray. When child falls snare practised offenders, escape becomes impossible bird limed twig." "So I believe," replied Frank. "Grandmama told youngest children poor people, first sent school London, often waylaid old women sell apples street, pretend good-natured make presents fruit. Of course acceptable, time, wicked wretches propose child return shall bring book, anything he pick home, shall paid apples pears. Few little boys sufficient firmness comply, whether like not, case almost hopeless, because, whenever poor victim hesitates steal more, cruel women threaten inform parents his misconduct, terrifies boy anything rather found out." "Oh, dreadful!" exclaimed Laura. "It begins smoothly! No poor little boy could suspect danger, he becomes hardened thief once." "Grandmama says, too, pick-pockets, London used stuffed figure man hung roof rooms, covered bells, boys practise upon, one allowed attempt stealing streets, till he could pick pocket dangling effigy, without ringing one many bells ornamented." "I think," said Harry, "when young thieves saw figure hanging air, might reminded soon would share fate. Even crows take warning see brother crow hanging dead field." "It curious thing crows, Harry, certainly punish thieves among themselves," observed Major Graham. "In large rookery, outcasts frequently observed living apart rest, allowed associate respectable brethren. I remember hearing formerly, great rookery --------, birds absent, one solitary crow observed linger behind, stealing materials his nest around, next morning prodigious uproar heard among trees,--the cawing became vociferous, evidently several great orators agitating crowd, till suddenly enraged crows flew body upon nest dishonest associate, tore pieces." "Bravo!" cried Frank. "I like hear odd ways birds animals! Grandmama mentioned lately, that, catch crow, fasten his back ground, he makes outcry, his black brothers come wheeling place, till one last alights help him. Immediately treacherous prisoner grapples hold his obliging friend, never afterwards let us escape; so, fastening one another, might entrap whole rookery." "I shall try day!" exclaimed Harry, eagerly. "What fun hear croaking cawing!" "We shall croaking soon colds, hurry home," added uncle David. "There thimbleful light remaining, grandmama impatient hear news. This really adventurous night, I sure none us soon forget it." When whole party entered drawing-room, blaze spirits, speaking once, tell Lady Harriet occurred, Mrs. Crabtree, waiting take couple little prisoners bed, suddenly gave exclamation astonishment dismay she looked Harry, now, first time since robber knocked down, approached light, he did, sure, appear terrible spectacle! His jacket bespattered mud, his shirt-frill torn bloody, one eye almost swelled his head, side his face quite black blue. "What mischief now, Mr. Harry?" cried Mrs. Crabtree, angrily; "you leave whole bone body, whole shirt drawer!" "These honourable scars, Mrs. Crabtree," interrupted Major Graham. "Harry fighting battles, gained great victory! must illuminate nursery!" Uncle David told whole story, many droll remarks, his purse stolen, said that, Harry never complained hurt, he never supposed anything kind could occurred; he felt much pleased observe well certain young gentleman able bear pain, boys must expect hard blows world, fight way life, therefore well give could, bear fortitude fell share. Uncle David slyly added, perhaps Harry put things better much practice nursery. Mrs. Crabtree seemed rather proud Harry's manly spirit, treated little respect usual, saying, she would fetch hot water foment his face, he would go straight stairs Laura. Now, seldom happened, Harry went straight anywhere, he generally swung bannisters again, took leap thing he saw way, got upon tables jumped off, night he resolutely intended marching steadily bed, advanced considerable way, loud shout street attracted his attention. Harry stopped, repeated again, seizing Laura hand, flew eagerly Lady Harriet's dressing-room, throwing open window, picked couple cloaks lying chair, stepped balcony find going on; case one see unusual place, Harry quietly shut window down, intending remain one single minute. Minutes run fast away people amused, nothing could diverting sight beheld, moment grand crash exploded squibs rockets Castle-hill, looked beautiful dark, seemed impossible think anything else. Some flew high air, burst appearance twenty fiery serpents falling sky, others assumed variety colours, dropped like flying meteors, looking stars learning dance, many rushed air disappeared, leaving trace behind. Harry Laura stood perfectly entranced admiration delight, till fire-works neither burst, cracked, exploded more. A ballad-singer next attracted notice, singing tune "Meet moonlight," afterwards Laura shewed Harry constellation Orion mentioned Bible, which, besides Great Bear, one she slightest acquaintance with. Neither ever observed Northern Lights brilliant before, felt almost alarmed see shooting like lances fire across sky, glittering many bright colours, like rainbow, Laura remembered her grandmama mentioning days ago, poor natives Greenland believe spirits fathers going forth battle. Meantime, Lady Harriet called Frank, usual, his evening prayers reading her dressing-room, well known account disturbed. After read chapter, talked seriously intended teach, begun discuss prospect Frank going abroad soon become midshipman, he wondering much his first great shipwreck would take place, telling Lady Harriet loss Cabalvala, crew lived eight days barren rock, nothing eat cask raspberry jam, accidentally floated within reach. Before Frank finished his story, however, he suddenly paused, sprung upon his feet exclamation astonishment, Lady Harriet, looking hastily round direction, became terrified observe couple faces looking window. It dark, she could see like, moment afterwards sash began slowly heavily opening, two figures leaped room, Frank flew ring peal bell, Lady Harriet sunk her arm-chair, covering her face her hands, nearly fainting fright. "Never mind, grandmama! afraid! us!" cried Harry; "surely know me?" "You!!!" exclaimed Lady Harriet, looking amazement. "Harry Laura!! impossible! world get here? I thought bed half hour ago! Tiresome boy! death time other! I wonder ever pass day without deserving bastinado!" "Do remember good day last month, grandmama, I severe toothache, sat morning beside fire? Nobody found fault then, I got safe bed, without single Oh fie! noon till night." "Wonderful, indeed! pity I ever allowed tooth drawn, behaved bravely occasion extracted. Now take off! I feel perfectly certain tell Mrs. Crabtree exact truth been, she punishes you, remember deserve. People behave ill punishers, glad one kindly take trouble teach better." CHAPTER XI. THE POOR BOY. Not fine things fine people possess, Should teach poor despise; For it is good manners, good dress, That truest gentility lies. The following Saturday morning, Frank, Harry, Laura assembled Lady Harriet's breakfast hour, talking adventures night illumination; many merry laugh heard uncle David cracked his jokes told his stories, he seemed full fun spirits youngest boy play-ground. "Well, old fellow!" said he, lifting Harry, suddenly seating high marble chimney-piece. "That situation poor little dwarf, Baron Borowloski always put his tall wife, she wished keep mischief, I wonder Mrs. Crabtree never thought plan you." "Luckily fire, Harry would soon roasted Giant Snap- them-up's dinner," said Frank, laughing; "he looks like China Mandarin. Shake head, Harry, quite well!" "Uncle David!" cried Harry, eagerly, "pray let see stand one moment club cold day, feet upon rug, back fire, coat-tails arms! Pray do, one minute!" Uncle David he asked, evidently expecting result, took place, Harry sprung upon his back agility monkey, went round round room full gallop, next five minutes, Lady Harriet said she never saw two noisy people, quite fashion now, since king France carried his grandchildren, way, every morning, picture lately shown her. "Then I hope his majesty gets good appetite his romp I done," replied Major Graham, sitting down. "None tea toast me! fit ladies. Frank, reach beef-steaks, cup chocolate." Harry Laura planted window, gazing crowds people passed, while, way joke, guessed everybody come for, were. "There fat cook basket her arm, going market," said Harry. "Did ever observe Mrs. Marmalade comes home, she says grandmama, 'I desired leg mutton come here, lady! I told goose also,' leg mutton goose walked here, arm-in-arm, themselves." "Look children, going see wild beasts," added Laura, "and little girl her way buy new frock. I sure she needs one! old man hurrying along he late mail-coach; lady gown like yellow daffodil, going take root Botanical Gardens!" "Uncle David! poorest boy I ever saw!" cried Harry, turning eagerly round; "he standing cold here, ten minutes, looking picture misery! he wears hat, pulled his long lank hair make bow, twenty times. Do come look him! he pale, his clothes seem made he began grow, much small, he making us many signs open window. May I it?" "No! no! I never give chance beggars kind, especially young able-bodied fellows like that, many needy, deserving people I visit, worked long could, I know sober honest. Most money scatter street beggars goes straight gin-shop, even youngest children buy steal, get means becoming intoxicated. Only last week, Harry, landlord ale-house Portobello seen head long table, surrounded ragged beggar boys twelve fourteen years age, perfectly drunk, probably friend might party." "Oh no! uncle David! boy seems quite sober exceedingly clean, though he poor!" replied Laura; "his black trowsers patched repatched, his jacket faded fifty colours, his shoes mended every direction, still he looks almost respectable. His face thin might use hatchet. I wish would take one little peep, he seems anxious speak us." "I daresay that! know youngster tell! Probably wife six small children home, or, like better, he shipwrecked sailor service. I know whole affair already; sixpence spare, Laura, come breakfast, shall bestow poor blind Mrs. Wilkie, bed-ridden last ten years; old paralytic Jemmy Dixon porter, worked hard long he able. If twenty sixpences, I could tell twenty people deserve much." "Very true," added Lady Harriet. "Street beggars, young able work, like boy, cruelty encourage. Parents bring children profligate idleness, hoping gain money lying cheating, honest industry, often succeed, especially wicked mothers also starve disfigure poor creatures, excite compassion. We must relieve real distress, Harry, search would hidden treasures, thus show love God man; large purse easy strings harm good." "Do remember, Frank, long I suspected old John Davidson imposing upon me?" said Major Graham. "He told dismal story always, I never liked refuse assistance; yesterday, he here, thought struck chance say, 'What fine supper last night, John!' You seen start he gave, his look consternation, he answered, 'Eh, Sir! ye hear that! We got turkey cheap, none us took two glasses toddy.'" "That boy pointing his pockets, making signs us open window!" exclaimed Laura. "What mean! he seems anxious!" Major Graham threw his knife fork--rose hastily breakfast--and flung open window, calling rather loud, angry voice, "What want, idle fellow? It perfect shame see standing morning! Surely do not mean say active youngster like would disgrace begging?" "No, Sir! I want nothing!" answered boy respectfully, colouring deepest scarlet. "I never asked money life, I never will." "That is right, good boy!" answered Major, instantly changing his tone. "What brings then?" "Please, Sir, servants shut door face, every body hasty like, I do not know do. I cannot listened minute, though I got something particular say, one would glad hear." Major Graham looked exceedingly vexed himself, spoken roughly poor boy, thoughtful, mild, care-worn countenance, extremely interesting, his manner seemed better his dress. Frank despatched, willing messenger, bring young stranger stairs, uncle David told Harry he would take lesson ever afterwards, judge hastily appearances, impossible one guess might mind another; he began hope boy, civil well-spoken, might yet turn proper, industrious little fellow. "Well, lad! Is anything I you?" asked Major Graham, Frank led kindly room. "What name?" "Evan Mackay, service. Please, Sir, lose pocket-book last Thursday, name back, nine gold sovereigns inside?" "Yes! I did, cost! Have heard anything it?" The boy silently drew parcel his pocket, without looking speaking, he modestly placed table, colouring deeply, he turned away, hurried towards door. In another minute he would off, Frank sprung forward took hold his arm, saying, kindest possible manner, "Stop, Evan! Stop moment! That parcel seems contain uncle's money. Where get it? Who sent here?" "I brought it, Sir! The direction pocket-book, could mistake." "Did find then?" "Yes! lying street night I ran Doctor see mother, dying. She told come back directly, Sir, I must going." "But let us give something honest," said Frank. "You fine fellow, deserve well rewarded." "I duty, Sir. Mother always says right conscience' sake, reward." "Yes! justly entitled this," said Major Graham, taking sovereign purse. "I shall yet, meantime honestly earned to-day." "If I thought so, Sir,"----said poor boy, looking wistfully glittering coin. "If I quite sure could harm----, I must speak first mother it, Sir! She seen better days once, she sadly afraid ever taking charity. Mother mends clothes, teaches herself, works hard ways, she quite bed-ridden, scarcely anything trifle I make working fields. It difficult get job sometimes, could put way earning money, Sir, would make mother happy. She little particular, would taste morsel I could get asking it." "That proud!" said Harry. "No, Sir! pride," replied Evan; "but mother says merciful God provided her many years, she begin distrust Him now. Her hands always busy, her heart always cheerful. She rears many little plants her bedside, sell, she teaches neighbour's children, besides sewing one employ her, mother's maxim always was, thing idle Christian." "Very true!" said Lady Harriet. "Even apostles mending nets labouring hard, whenever teaching. Either body mind always active." "If saw mother, exactly her way, she eat bread idleness. Were stranger offer us blanket dinner charity, she would rather go without take it. A kind lady brought her gown one day, mother would she allowed knit many stockings would pay stuff. I dare take penny work due, she says, I begin receiving alms, I might get accustomed it." "That good old Scotch feeling former days," observed Major Graham. "It sometimes carried far then, enough now. Your mother lived fifty years ago." "You may say so, indeed, Sir! We never drop broth soup-kitchen winter, many day shivered without fire, though society offered her sixpence a-week coals, she says 'the given morsel soon done;' now, many neighbours wasted got, feel worse we, accustomed suffer want, live upon honest labour. Long ago, mother went tea neighbours, she always took her tea along us." "But prouder anybody else," observed Frank, smiling. "If grandmama goes tea-party, she allows her friends provide fare." "Very likely, Sir! different people give good get. Last week kind neighbour sent us nice loaf bread, mother made take back, her best thanks, she preferred oat cake. She ready give take, Sir, divides her last bannock, sometimes, anybody worse ourselves." "Poor fellow!" said Frank, compassionately; "how much must often suffered!" "Suffered!" said boy, sudden emotion. "Yes! I suffered! It matters nothing clothed rags,--to cold hungry now! There worse trials that! My father died last year, crushed death moment his cart-wheels,--my brothers sisters gone grave, scarcely able afford medicines might cured them,--and I left alone poor dying mother. It comfort life long, may trust God lasts." "Could take us see Mrs. Mackay?" said Major Graham, kindly. "Laura, get bonnet." "Oh, Sir! young lady could stay half minute place poor mother lives now. It pretty cottage read tracts, dark cold room, high stair, narrowest lane ever saw, nothing sit old chest." "Never mind that, Evan," replied Major Graham. "You mother spirit honour honesty might shame many lying sofas silk damask. I respect her, shall assist possible. Show us way." Many dirty closes narrow alleys threaded whole party, reached dark ruinous staircase, Evan paused looked round, see whether Major Graham still approached. He slowly mounted one flight ancient crumbling steps another, lighted patched broken windows, till last arrived narrow wooden flight, perfectly dark. After groping summit, perceived time-worn door, latch gently lifted Evan, stole noiselessly room, followed uncle David wondering children. There, large cold room, nearly empty, exceedingly clean, presented notice. In one corner stood massive old chest carved oak, surrounded perfect glow geraniums myrtles full blossom; beside arranged large antique Bible, jug cold water, pile coarsely-knitted worsted stockings. Beyond these, bed clean straw, lay tall, emaciated old woman, apparently last stage life, face haggard suffering; yet her thin, withered hands busily occupied needle-work, while, low, faltering tones, she chanted words, "When dust death I rise, To claim mansion skies, This, shall plea, Jesus liv'd died me." "Mother!" said Evan, wishing arouse her attention. "Look, mother!" "Good day, Mrs. Mackay," added Major Graham, voice great consideration, she languidly turned her head towards door. "I come thank restoring purse morning." "You kindly welcome, Sir! What else could do!" replied she, feeble, tremulous voice. "The money yours, sooner went hands better." "It perfectly safe stayed there," added Major Graham, affecting speak homely accent, putting airs condescension all, sitting old chest he never sat thing chest his life before, looking clean bare floor much respect Turkey carpet. "Your little boy's pocket seems safe Bank Scotland." "That true, Sir! My boy honest; well keep good conscience, he world live for. Many heavy conscience carry heavy purse; he need envy. If poor world, rich faith; I trust money even temptation Evan, he learned best teachers, would 'profit nothing gain whole world, lose his soul.'" "True, Mrs. Mackay! true! We come morning request he favour accept small recompense." "We already rewarded, Sir! This opportunity testifying hearts desire right eye God. At time, Providence kindly directed son's steps place money lying; anything seems justly due poor Evan, let it. My wants few, must soon ended. But oh! I look boy, think long years he may struggling poverty temptation, heart melts within me, whole spirit broken. Faith seems fail, I could beggar now! It money I would ask, Sir, might soon spent; get honest employment, I thank knees." Evan seemed startled sudden energy his mother's manner, tears sprung his eyes she spoke degree agitation different he ever heard before; he struggled conceal his feelings, she continued increasing emotion, "Bodily suffering, many year care sorrow, fast closing work me. The moments passing away like weaver's shuttle; I less anxiety Evan, blessed prospect would appear; bitterness death now. My poor, poor boy! I would rather hear he way earning his livelihood, he got hundred a-year. Tell me, Sir!--and oh! consider speaking dying creature--can possibly give creditable employment, he might gain crust bread, independent?" "I honour proper feeling subject, Mrs. Mackay, shall help Evan best ability," replied Major Graham, tone seriousness sincerity. "To judge fine geraniums, he must fond cultivating plants; want under-gardener country; therefore he shall situation without loss time." "Oh, mother! mother! speak dying! You surely get better now!" said Evan, looking up, his thin pale face assumed momentary glow pleasure. "Try get better! I never could work well, waiting see come home! We shall happy now!" "Yes! I happy!" said Mrs. Mackay, solemnly looking towards heaven, expression could mistaken. "The last cord cut bound earth; may you, Sir, find hereafter blessings promised visit fatherless widows affliction." CHAPTER XII. THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN. When hands link'd dread part, And heart met throbbing heart; Oh! bitter, bitter smart Of bid farewell. Heber. Next Monday morning, early hour, Frank found his way great difficulty house Widow Mackay, he spent his pocket money two fine scarlet geraniums. If nettles cabbages, he would felt pleasure buying them; his eyes sparkled animation he entered uncle David's room, carrying his hand, saying, "I glad money! I could spare quite well. There greater pleasure rich help poor people Evan Mackay his poor sick mother!" "Yes, Frank, I often wonder enjoyment wealth considered equal exercise kind feelings, surely delightful sensation world is, deserve receive grateful affection around us," replied Major Graham. "What wretched Robinson Crusoe desert island alone, though he found chests gold, yet many people unblessed midst society, selfishly hoard fortunes themselves, unmindful many around ought gratefully receiving daily benefits." "I laughing read lately West India slaves, collected money lives old stocking," said Frank, "and watched delight filled year year; bank great stocking, misers country lay treasures never enjoy, though often lay treasures better world." "I frequently think, Frank, men liberal, kind, forbearing Holy Scriptures enjoin, lived soberly, temperately, godly together, paradise world would become, many worst sufferings brought folly, unkindness others. And certainly, wished fancy wretchedness hell itself, would necessary imagine earth would become fear God man removed, every person lived his angry, selfish passions would dictate. Great blessings owe Christianity, making world even now, yet greater would blessings be, obeyed better." "That exactly grandmama says, must attend Gospel love gratitude God, rather fear punishment hope reward, precisely saw poor widow Mackay Evan, seemed scarcely expect recompense behaving honestly." "That remarkable them, Christians receiving public recompense duty God. Men world long rewarded public dinners pieces plate, express utmost praise admiration, late I never open newspaper without reading accounts one clergyman another, 'honoured public breakfast!' he presented admiring circle 'a gold watch appendages!' Bible complimentary inscription, gown, pair bands, worked ladies his congregation! this, labouring among his people, his sphere duty! What would Archbishop Leighton old divines said one attempted rouse vanity way, praise men?" "What say reminds me, uncle David," said Frank, "that asked present Universal-Knowledge-Master silver snuff-box, testimonial scholars class, he going soon Van Dieman's Land, therefore I hope give half-a-crown subscribe, I shall quite disgrace him." "Not one shilling shall receive me, good friend, purpose! snuff-box, indeed! master ought show his scholars example using none! filthy waste health, money, time. Such testimonials given, Archbishop Magee says, persons got scrape, makes respectability doubtful. If grocer ever publicly presented pair silver sugar tongs, I shall think he accused adulterating sugar, give employing directly." "Laura," said Frank, "you silver thimble voted hemming six pocket-handkerchiefs six years!" "I know one clergyman, Dr. Seton, conscientiously refused piece plate, presented way," continued Major Graham; "he accidentally heard subscription begun among rich members his congregation, instantly stopped it, saying, 'Let testimonial consist regular attendance church, let sole reward enjoyed hereafter, appear crown joy rejoicing presence Lord Jesus Christ his coming.'" Sir Edward Graham's particular friend, Captain Gordon, last wrote say, Thunderbolt, 74, put commission three years, sail African station, therefore he wished Frank join without delay; farther mark his regard, he promised he would endeavour keep his young protege employed he served his time, midshipman paid off, like stranded whale, easily set afloat again. Lady Harriet sighed she read letter, looked paler day, she knew right necessary Frank go, therefore she said nothing distress occasion, her prayers explanations Bible evening, deeper tone feeling ever, cast melancholy, rarely case before, he spoke much meeting better world, surest hope consolation Christians separate earth, know day, still less many years, may bring forth. Major Graham tried put cheerful face matter also, though he evidently felt sorry indeed parting Frank, took long walk discuss his future prospects, saying, "Now officer gentleman, entitled therefore treated new respect attention, brother officers, naval military, his Majesty's service." Frank himself, boy great spirit enterprize, felt glad time really come his afloat, examining world his eyes; he said his heart seemed put swing, fell low he thought leaving his dear happy home, rose higher ever idea launched wide ocean, going countries he often read of, battles fought victories won. "Frank!" said Peter Grey, going join Thunderbolt, fortnight afterwards, "you idea beautiful I looked uniform to-day! I tried mine on, felt impatient use dirk, I could eat dinner it, instead employing common knife." "You never forget hungry, Peter," said Frank, laughing. "But like old Lord Buchan, used say he could cook his porridge his helmet, stir his broad-sword." "I hope," said Major Graham, "you intend become distinguished officers, leave name world grows pale." "Certainly," answered Peter. "All old heroes read shall mere nobodies compared me! I mean lose leg arm every battle,"---- "Till nothing left shirt-collar shoe-strings," interrupted Frank, laughing. "No! No! What remains last shall die Peer realm," continued Peter. "We must climb top tree, Frank! What title think I take?" "Lord Cockpit would suit best time, Peter! It easy business rise think. Every one run race, win," observed Major Graham. "The rarest thing earth succeed conspicuous respectable. Any dunce may easily either one other, chief puzzle men is, both. In profession great opportunities, time let warn you, sea bed roses." "No, uncle David! I hope become field laurels us," replied Frank, laughing. "Now tell real earnest think greatest naval heroes till now, Peter cut out." "He must wait years. It long ladder run reaching top. In France, king's sons born Field Marshals, nobody country born Admiral. The great Lord Duncan served half-a-century gaining his important victory, previous that, he paved way success, mere animal courage alone, truly good religious man, his extraordinary firmness benevolence character gained confidence respect served him, therefore half his success battle owing his admirable conduct peace." "So I heard!" replied Frank; "and mutiny every ship, Admiral's crew remained faithful him. How much better obeyed respect attachment fear, mean feeling I hope neither feel myself, excite others. I wish like Nelson, asked, 'What fear? I never saw it.'" "Yes, Frank! Nelson said 'brave lion, gentle lamb.' Certainly he Lord Duncan pre-eminently great; neither Lord Duncan, enlightened Christian, would said Lord Nelson did, his latent breath--'I great sinner!' No mortal could lift his eyes day judgment, repeat words again; every man breathes breath life great sinner. We living God's world without remembering him, continually; amidst thousands blessings disobey him. The chief purpose men created, glorify God, prepare entering his presence better world; instead so, live object live for, pleasures amusements earth. How, then, otherwise great sinners? I hope, Frank, endeavour be, like Lord Duncan, merely good officer, also good Christian; for, besides fighting battles country, must gain great victory yourself, men must either conquer evil dispositions, perish ever." Lady Harriet particularly earnest entreating Frank write frequently home; observing, she considered religious duty children, shew parents attention, Bible says "a wise son maketh glad father," "the father righteous shall greatly rejoice;" contrary, many young persons leave parents mourn suspense anxiety, health happiness love ever love one else. "Tell us every thing interests you, even spouting whales, flying fish, dying dolphins, course see," said Laura. "Be sure write us also, many albatrosses shoot, whether duly introduced Neptune Cape." "Yes, Laura! Bishop Heber's Journal, book describing voyage Cape, mentions exactly thing. It quite bring home I speak paper; I shall able fancy everybody say letter read. Mrs. Darwin sent morning particular business; say she wished me, strange countries Thunderbolt touched, employ spare moments chasing butterflies, many possible might added her museum." "Capital! How like Mrs. Darwin!" exclaimed Major Graham, laughing. "You course running Africa, hat hand, pursuing painted butterflies, till get _coup de soleil_, like friend Watson, killed one. Poor fellow! I then, frightful scene. He wheeled round several times, sort convulsion, till he dropped dead arms." "I shall gild legs bills ducks leaving home, send her present Sierra Leone," said Peter. "The wings might died scarlet, would look quite foreign; elephant falls way, shall stuffed forwarded express." "Uncle David! Do remember fun had, sent Mrs. Darwin stuffed bear present! I desired announce foreigner distinction arrived stay her house. What bustle she hearing he brought letters introduction you, intended remain time. Then told her he could speak word English, brought 'a Pole' him; besides he great dancer. Oh! amusing was, she last ventured passage introduced, saw her fine stuffed bear." "Whatever people collect," said Peter, "every good-natured person assists. I mean begin collection crooked sixpences immediately; therefore, pray never spend another, give many spare; crooked better." "Sing song sixpence!" said Frank, laughing. "Laura begin collect diamonds necklace, perhaps might ready she comes out. I shall return home purpose see then, Laura." "Pray do, Master Frank," said Mrs. Crabtree, usual kindness; "we shall great rejoicings occasion seeing back--an ox roasted alive, England, sort Tom-fooleries. I will dance jig joy--you certainly wonderful good boy, considering I managing you." Frank's departure delayed till examination his school, Mr. Lexicon requested that, best scholar there, he might remain receive whole library prize-books, whole pocketful medals; for, Peter remarked, "Frank Graham deserved reward, he learned his lessons perfectly, he could say wrong even he wished!" Harry Laura allowed attend great occasion, might witness Frank's success; never, certainly, seen thing grand lives before! A hundred forty boys, dressed white trowsers yellow gloves, seated rows, opposite six grave learned-looking gentlemen, wigs spectacles, seemed would condemn scholars death! The colour mounted Harry's cheeks delight, tears rushed his eyes, he saw Frank, whose face radiant good-humour happiness, take his place head boy school. All his companions crowded round Frank he entered, knowing his last appearance class; he spoke merry kind word each, leaning shoulder one, grasping hand another cordial kindness, he liked everybody, everybody liked him. No one envied Frank dux, knew hard he worked place, anxious he help every boy learning cleverly himself; boobies would become duxes Frank could assisted rise, many idler made busy his attention advice. No boy ever received, one day, presents Frank occasion his young friends, spent pocket-money pen-knives pencil-cases, kept Frank, remembrance them, long he lived; his companions tear eye bidding farewell, pleased gifts. Major Graham took his place, gravity usual, among judges appointed distribute prizes; now, two hours, puzzling questions could invented put every scholar succession, Frank seemed always ready answer, spoke himself, often good-naturedly prompted his neighbours, low tone one else heard him. His eyes brightened, his face grew red anxiety, even his voice shook first; long Frank collected his wits him, could construe Latin repeat Greek perfect ease, till length whole examination concluded, great Dr. Clifford, lately come way Oxford, requested present prizes. Upon he rose majestically his arm-chair, made long speech, filled full could hold Latin Greek. He praised Homer Horace nearly twenty minutes, brought several lines Virgil, he turned Frank, saying, tone great kindness condescension, though time exceedingly pompous, "It seems almost pity young gentleman--already accomplished scholar--who is, I may say, perfect _multum parvo_, prematurely pause his classical career enter navy; every situation life his extraordinary activity mind, good temper, courage ability, must render honour his country his profession." Dr. Clifford glanced list prizes, read aloud--"First prize Greek--Master Graham!" Frank walked gracefully forward, coloured bowed, words approbation said him, splendidly-bound copy Euripides put his hands Dr. Clifford, hastily read catalogue prizes himself, audible voice, tone great surprise. "First prize Latin!--Master Graham! First algebra,--first geography,--first mathematics,--all Master Graham!!!--and last, least, medal general good conduct, boys allowed bestow upon scholar think deserving,--and stands name Master Graham again!!" Dr. Clifford paused, boys stood moment clapped hands enthusiasm, token rejoicing destination medal. For first time Frank completely overcome,--he coloured deeply before, looked gratefully round, first his companions, his master, last Major Graham, tear standing his eye he smiled upon Frank, held his hand. Frank's lip quivered moment, he would burst tears, strong effort he recovered himself, affectionately grasping his uncle's hand, hastily resumed his place bench, remain his companions received smaller prizes awarded them. Meanwhile, Harry watching Frank feeling joy pride, he never experienced before, could scarcely refrain saying every person near him, "That brother!" He looked Frank long earnestly, wishing like him, resolving follow his good example school. He gazed again, new feelings pleasure admiration, till gradually his thoughts became melancholy, remembering soon must separated; suddenly terrible idea darted his mind, "Perhaps never may meet again!" Harry tried think this; he turned his thoughts subjects; he forced look anything going on, still words returned mournful apprehension his heart, "Perhaps never may meet again!" Frank's first action, examination concluded, hastily gather his books, bring sight Harry Laura; his astonishment when, instead looking prizes, Harry suddenly threw his arms round his neck, burst tears. "My dear--dear boy! happened!" exclaimed Frank, affectionately embracing him, looking much surprised. "Tell me, dear Harry, thing distressed you?" "I do not know well, Frank! going away,--and--and--I wish I better boy! I would thing bid now!--but I shall never happy again--no! never, without you!" "But, dear Harry! Laura grandmama, uncle David, left, I coming back day! Oh! happy meeting shall then!" said Frank, tears stood his eyes; drawing Harry's arm within his own, walked slowly away together. "I very--very anxious Laura happy," continued Frank, kindest manner; "but, dear Harry, take care bid, always prefer like! Mrs. Crabtree would half terrible provoke her new tricks every day. I almost like her myself; old proverb says, 'her bark worse her bite;' she often reminds funny old fable, mice afraid loud, fierce-looking cock, sleek, smooth-looking cat, people carrying gentler tongues yet quite difficult deal with. At time, seeing uncomfortable Laura feel Mrs. Crabtree, I written letter papa, asking, last request leaving home, he make change ministry, he always kind, I feel sure he grant it." "How good you, Frank!" said Harry. "I sure faults often disgrace, seldom punished till deserve it; I sorry going away, I think nothing else." "So I, sorry indeed; best comfort, far home, would be, think Laura happy, case become watchful please grandmama." "That true, Frank! I would rather offend twenty Mrs. Crabtrees one grandmama; perhaps uncle David may send school now, I shall try like you, sitting top class, getting prizes good behaviour." "Well, Harry! pleasantest days school I busiest, find thing. How delightful was, going tasks till quite perfect, rushing play-ground, mind got rest, body active; know seldom mind body work once, best way resting one is, make labour. That probably reason, Harry, games never half pleasant hard study." "Perhaps," replied Harry, doubtfully; "but I always hate thing I obliged do." "Then never sailor, I shall obliged fifty things a-day I would rather not; instance, get middle night, likely dreaming home again; but, grandmama says, pleasant duties, life would get well without them." "Yes--perhaps--I do not know!--we could find plenty ourselves, without anybody telling us. I like to-morrow, watch boys playing cricket, see races, Diorama, evening shoot bows arrows." "My good Sir! better would you, anybody else, life that! Not thing world made useless, Harry; weeds grow ground serviceable purpose, would wish creature earth living entirely yourself. It would better neither us ever born, time opportunities God gives us improving good others, wasted. Let hope, Harry, I away, often consider dull grandmama may feel, happy might make her attentive obedient." "Yes, Frank! I could never fill place!--that quite impossible! Nobody that!" "Try!--only try, Harry! grandmama easily pleased people best. She would felt well satisfied me, case." "Frank!" said Harry, sorrowfully, "I feel ten brothers going away instead one, good me! I shall sure mention prayers, I now." "Not all, Harry! though great deal; must write often, tell makes happy unhappy, I shall interested ever, separated. Tell everything school-fellows, too, Laura. There corner wide world I shall think every day, feel anxious least thing concerns you." "My dear boys!" said Major Graham, joined moments before, "it fortunate lived always home, make love affectionately long live. In England, children one family scattered different schools, without one care whether attached not, therefore earliest warmest friendships formed strangers age, perhaps never see again, leaving school. In case, brothers happy days childhood talk future life, have,--no little scrapes remember, got together--no pleasures enjoyed moment smile recollection of, friction tempers youth, makes every thing go smoothly brothers grow older; therefore, last grown thrown together, scarcely feel mutual friendship intimacy gentlemen testify towards other." "I dare say true," said Frank. "Tom Brownlow tells his three brothers come home Eton, Harrow, Durham, quarrel excessively, sometimes two speaking terms." "Not improbable," observed Major Graham. "In every thing see much better God's arrangements own. Families intended like little world themselves--old people govern young ones--young people make elders cheerful--grown-up brothers sisters show juniors good example--and children playthings companions seniors, end present system." "Old Andrew says large families 'squander' earth now," said Frank, laughing. "Yes! young children thrust preparatory schools--older boys go distant academies--youths College--and young men shipped abroad, among say his heart his home? Parents meantime, finding occupation amusement educating children, begin writing books, perhaps theories education, novels; try fill rest useless hours plays, operas, concerts, balls, clubs. If people could know best happiness life, certainly depends loved belong to; nothing called peace earth, consist family affection, built upon strong foundation religion morality." Sir Edward Graham felt proud Frank, gentlemen eldest sons, wrote affectionate letter occasion his going sea, promising meet Portsmouth, lamenting he still felt ill melancholy he could return home, meant try whether baths Germany would good. In letter enclosed he called "Frank's first prize-money," largest sum young midshipman ever seen his life, day his possession, half spent presents his friends. Not single person seemed forgotten except himself; Frank completely unselfish, Peter Grey laughingly said, "Frank scarcely remembers person world, therefore astonishing he contrives exist all." "If his worst fault, shew opposite example, Peter," said Major Graham, smiling; "number one great favourite you." "Frank also obliging!" added Lady Harriet; "he would anything body." "Ah, poor fellow! he cannot help that," said Peter, tone pity. "Some people born sort desperate activity--flying assist every one--running stairs whatever wanted--searching whatever lost--and picking whatever dropped. I seen several others like Frank, troubled sort turn. He indulging his inclination flying everywhere everybody, much I sitting still!--it nature!--you know tastes differ, people like apples like onions." Frank black shade himself, drawn uniform put gilt frame, one shilling, he presented his grandmama, looked sadly likeness he came smiling her dressing-room, calling Harry assist knocking nail wall, might hung chimney-piece. "I need nothing remind you, dear Frank," observed Lady Harriet, "and sad exchange, shadow substance." Frank gave handsome new red morocco spectacle-case uncle David, asked leave carry away old one remembrance. He bought gowns maids, books men-servants. He presented Mrs. Crabtree elegant set tea-cups saucers, promising send her box tea first time he went China; Laura Harry he produced magnificent magic lanthorn, representing stars planets, cost several guineas. It exhibited evening Frank went away, caused great entertainment large party his companions, assembled tea take leave him, occasion Peter Grey made funny speech, proposing Frank's health bumper bohea, whole party became merry, disperse till ten. Major Graham intended accompanying Frank Portsmouth, set mail next evening. That day sad one Harry Laura, allowed whole holiday; sound merriment heard house, except Frank tried make cheerful, planning done he came back, Major Graham invented droll stories adventures Frank would probably meet sea. Even Mrs. Crabtree looked grave cross usual; she brought Frank present needle-case made her hands, filled thread every kind, saying, she heard "midshipmites" learned mend things, keep decent, excellent custom, ought encouraged; she hoped he would remember, "a stitch time saves nine." Lady Harriet stayed day her dressing-room, tried conceal traces many tears she appear; evident sadly her time passed alone. "Grandmama!" said Frank, taking her hand affectionately, trying look cheerful; "we shall meet again; perhaps soon!" Lady Harriet silently laid her hand upon Bible, show she found certain assurance another meeting better world; she looked Frank melancholy affection, added, solemnly emphatically, "'There union hearts, That finds end.'" "But, grandmama! old!" exclaimed Laura, earnestly. "Lord Rockville born ten years sooner, besides, young people sometimes die older people." "Yes, Laura! young people may die, old people must. It possible feeble aged frame mine long remain visible world. 'The eye hath seen shall more.' I many friends earth now, it. The streets city would crowded, I knew still remember, could revived; turn fast coming, like theirs, Frank knows, do, hope prayer may certainly meet again." "Grandmama!" said Frank, low broken voice, "it wants hour time departure; I like much servants come family prayers uncle David would read us 14th chapter St. John." Lady Harriet rung bell, long whole household assembled, one would absent night Master Frank's departure home, deeply grieved at, even Mrs. Crabtree dashed tear her cheek she entered room. Frank sat his hand Lady Harriet's, Major Graham read beautiful comforting chapter selected, whole family kneeled solemn prayer together, many deep sob, could conquered, heard Frank himself. After over, he approached servants, silently shook hands each, could attempt speak; Lady Harriet led her dressing-room, remained time, till, carriage arrived, Frank hastened drawing-room, clasped Harry Laura his arms, having, voice choked grief, bid long farewell, he hurried presence. When door closed, something seemed fall heavily ground, scarcely attracted one's attention, till Major Graham followed Frank, shocked find lying staircase perfectly insensible. Instead calling assistance, however, uncle David carefully lifted Frank his arms, carried carriage, where, moments, fresh air, rapid motion revived his recollection, he burst tears. "Poor grandmama! Harry Laura!" cried he, weeping convulsively. "Oh! shall I see again!" "My dear boy!" said Major Graham, trying cheerful; "do think nobody ever left home before? One would suppose never expected come back! Three years seem age look forward, nothing fled. The longer live, shorter every year appears, seem day to-morrow rushing house again, us standing door welcome back. Think joyous moment be! There wide wonderful world see first, happy home afterwards revisit." "Yes, dear, good, kind uncle David! one ever happier home; till east comes west, I shall never cease think gratitude grandmama. We shall surely meet again. I must live upon prospect. Hope jewel remains wherever go, hope grandmama directed me, truly compared rainbow, brightens earth, stretches heaven." CHAPTER XIII. THE AMUSING DRIVE. I would enter list friends (Though grac'd polish'd manners fine sense, Yet wanting sensibility) man Who needlessly sets foot upon worm. Cowper. Lady Harriet confined bed several days Frank's departure home, week Harry Laura felt melancholy, even Mrs. Crabtree became sorry them, saying quite distressing see quiet good become, Master Harry mild milk now, she almost wished he would his old tricks again. On following Monday, message arrived Lady Rockville, say she going long drive her phaeton, visit boys Musselburgh school, would happy take Harry Laura party, grandmama objection. None made anybody, flew stairs get ready, Harry take three steps time, Laura, she followed, felt quite astonished find Mrs. Crabtree looking almost pleased herself, saying she hoped expedition would good. Before five minutes elapsed, Harry mounted dickey, Lady Rockville desired sit, instead footman, dismissed, room could made both; Harry touched his hat whenever party spoke him, he really servant. Laura, meanwhile, placed Lady Rockville Miss Perceval, she could hardly keep quiet minute joy, though afraid turn her head stir her little finger, case thought troublesome. "I told races take place Musselburgh to-day," said Lady Rockville. "It cruel amusement, derived sufferings noble animals; good right happy world ourselves, Laura; shall pass way, Harry probably see crowds carriages." "Oh, enchanting!--I never saw race-course life!" exclaimed Laura, springing her seat delight. "Harry! Harry! going races!" "Hurra!" exclaimed Harry, clapping his hands; "what delightful surprise! Oh! I dreadfully happy!" "After all, dear Lady Rockville," said Miss Perceval, yawning, "what horses got legs for, except run?" "Yes, pace! It always shocked me--formerly Doncaster, jockeys sometimes paid £1000 winning--to see poor animals lashed spurred along course, foaming fatigue, gasping till nearly expired. Horses, poor creatures, hour birth till death, sad time it!" "Grandmama read beautiful description wild horse his natural state liberty," said Laura. "Among South American forests he seen carrying his head erect, sparkling eyes, flowing mane, splendid tail, trotting among noble trees, cropping grass his feet, looking quite princely, precisely he pleased." "Then look contrast," said Lady Rockville, pointing long row cart-horses galled sides, shrivelled skins, broken knees, emaciated bodies, dragging weary load along. "Animals meant use man, abused, like poor creatures!" "As racing," said Miss Perceval, "a thorough-bred horse enters spirit quite much his rider. Did never hear Quin's celebrated steed, became eager win, his antagonist passed he seized violently leg, jockeys dismount furious animal might torn away. The famous horse Forester, too, caught hold his opponent jaw, could scarcely disengaged." "Think cruel training poor creatures went came that," added Lady Rockville; "of way horses beaten, spurred, severely cut whip; then, strength fails, like well-known 'high-mettled racer,' poor animal probably sold last perpetual hard labour ill-usage." "Uncle David shewed yesterday," said Laura, "that horrid picture probably seen, Cruickshanks, Knackers' Yards London, old horses sent end miserable days, impossible torture longer working. Oh! dreadful! yet grandmama said whole sketch taken life." "I know that," answered Lady Rockville. "In places wretched animals literally put death starvation, may seen gnawing other's manes last agonies hunger." "My dear Lady Rockville," exclaimed Miss Perceval, affectedly, "how talk unpleasant things!--there Act Parliament cruelty animals, course thing exists now. Many gentlemen vastly kind old horses, turning grass years, may enjoy life elegant leisure rural retirement, which, doubt, well entitled; instance, famous horse Eclipse, gained his owner £25,000! I wish he mine!" "But think many ruined one enriched, indeed ruined morals good feeling; therefore I glad sex never yet taken turf. It bad enough, dear Miss Perceval, see taken moors; I say I think amazons lately killed six brace grouse 12th August, would probably challenge single combat. Lord Rockville says, 'What gentlemen worsted work, ladies shouldering double-barrelled guns, he scarcely thinks world he born long ago.'" The carriage, moment, began proceed along road extraordinary rapidity, seemed danger following dust equipage, Miss Perceval became exceedingly alarmed, especially Lady Rockville mentioned one first times she driven her new coachman, seemed unsteady his seat, she felt apprehensive, time, he might drunk. "A tipsy coachman! Dear Lady Rockville, let out! We shall certainly killed crowd carriages! I walk home! Pray stop him, Miss Laura! I came look race, run one myself! This fast driving like railroad, quite straight! I verily believe run with! Stop, coachman!--stop!" In spite Miss Perceval's exclamations vociferations, carriage flew frightful rapidity, though reeled side side road, become intoxicated like driver himself, lashed his horses galloped along, within inch hedges ditches way, till last, reached race-course, he pulled suddenly violently, horses nearly fell back haunches, he swore furious shocking manner. Lady Rockville stood up, spoke coachman severely his misconduct, first driving her dangerously fast, disrespectful enough use profane language her presence, adding, he conduct properly, she must complain Lord Rockville soon carriage returned home. Upon hearing this, man looked exceedingly sulky, muttered angrily tipsy voice, till last he suddenly threw away reins, and, rising box, he began scramble his way down, nearly falling ground his haste, saying, "if ladyship pleased driving, may drive yourself!" After intoxicated man staggered towards drinking-booth far off, disappeared, leaving Miss Perceval perfectly planet-struck astonishment, actually dumb several minutes wonder, she heard saw. There sat Harry, alone dicky, behind two spirited blood-horses, foaming mouth speed come, ready start slightest hint, noises every side heard enough frighten pair hobby-horses. Piemen ringing bells--blind fiddlers playing tune--boys calling lists horses--drums beating starting-post--ballad singers squalling full pitch voices--horses galloping--grooms quarrelling--dogs barking--and children crying. In midst uproar, Harry unexpectedly observed Captain Digby horseback far off. Without losing moment, he stood up, waving his handkerchief, calling beg he would come carriage immediately, want assistance; Lady Rockville told, soon he arrived, though hardly able help laughing she explained it, extraordinary predicament placed in. Captain Digby, upon hearing story, looked ready go like squib rage offending coachman, instantly seizing driving-whip, he desired his servant hold horses' heads, he proceeded towards drinking-booth, flourishing long lash his hand he went ominous manner. Several minutes elapsed, Harry overheard prodigious outcry tent, drunken coachman seen reeling away along road, Captain Digby, still brandishing whip, returned, mounting dicky himself, he gathered reins, insisted driving Lady Rockville's phaeton her. Before long ranged close beside chariot full ladies, seemed ready burst, Harry amused perceive Peter Grey another boy, seated rumble behind, spread table-cloth roof carriage, using dining-table, seemed determined astonish appetites quantity oysters sandwiches ate, drinking time large tumblers porter. Lady Rockville wished she could loan Harry Laura's spirits hour two, she saw perfectly bewildered delight beholding thousands eager persons assembled race-ground,--jockeys riding liveries gay tulips--officers scarlet uniform--red flags fluttering breeze--caravans exhibiting pictures wildest-looking beasts world--bands music--recruiting parties--fire-eaters, dined red-hot pokers--portraits representing pigs fatter fattest world--giants head three pair shoulders taller one else, little dwarfs, scarcely visible naked eye--all shown children half price! Lady Rockville good naturedly gave Harry half-a-crown, promising that, leaving race-ground, he either buy oranges lay dust his throat long drive, visit many shows he pleased his half-crown; anxiously discussing five sights would worth sixpence each, loud hurra heard, drums beat, five horses started first heat. Harry stood ecstacy delight, spoke loudly admiration jockey grey horse, pink jacket, took lead, seemed perfectly fly, he need never touch ground; Harry exclaimed angrily next rider, yellow dress green cap, pulled back his bay horse, he really wished lose. To Laura's astonishment, however, Captain Digby preferred him, Miss Perceval declared favour light-blue jacket chesnut horse. Harry thought everybody stupid agree him, called height his eagerness, "I would bet half-crown upon pink jacket!" "Done!" cried Peter, laughing. "The yellow dress green cap money!" "Then I shall soon five shillings!" exclaimed Harry great glee; scarcely he spoken, loud murmuring sound arose among surrounding crowd, upon hearing he looked anxiously about, astonished see green cap yellow dress already winning-post, his favourite grey horse cantered slowly along, far behind others, carrying jockey pink jacket, hung his head, bent nearly double, shame fatigue. Peter Grey gave loud laugh triumph he glanced Harry's disappointed angry countenance, held his hand half-crown, saying, "Pay debt honour, Master Harry! It rather fortunate I won, seeing one sixpence I paid with! penny jingle mile-stone. You money wit, I wit money, well met. Did see grey horse fallen lame? Good-bye, youngster! I shall tell giants wild beasts expect another day!" "Harry!" said Lady Rockville, looking gravely his enraged countenance, "it foolish fish caught every bait! I quite relieved lost money. This early lesson gambling, one ever rich happy becomes fond it. We wrong bring all; I see could easily led dreadful vice, caused misery ruin thousands young men. If possessed estate, would thrown away quite foolishly poor half-crown, making perhaps miserable afterwards life." "I thought quite sure win!" exclaimed Harry, still looking angry astonishment Peter, making odd grimaces, holding half-crown teazing manner. "I would rather thrown money sea given Peter." "Think, too, many pleasanter better ways are, might spent it!" added Lady Rockville. "Look poor blind man could relieved, consider nice present given Laura! But seem brains head, Harry, her thimble!" "Peter quite little black-leg already," observed Miss Perceval. "I never saw boy! So fond attracting notice, he would put cap bells would make stared at. Last Saturday he undertook bet make ceremonious bow every lamp-post along Prince's Street, I wish could seen wondering crowd gradually collected he went along, performing his task perfect composure impudence." "For cool assurance, I hope many boys equal him," said Lady Rockville. "He scattered window lately several red-hot half-pence, among beggars, I told perfectly stuck poor creatures' fingers trying pick up; he sent message, his pony, one cold day lately, Lady De Vere's, offered, he taking leave, cut one her finest camellias, he replied, 'I would much rather offered hot potatoe!'" "Peter feels sympathy disappointment, Harry," added Miss Perceval; "but might well expect wool dog, friendship gambler, would ruin his father, always laughs lose." "Go cut wisdom teeth, Harry!" said Captain Digby, smiling. "Any one must born blind observe grey horse falling behind; bought half-a-crown's worth wisdom experience, I hope last life. Never venture bet even head shoulders, may turn mistake." "Harry monkey seen world, I think whole year Saturdays he ever commits blunder again," continued Lady Rockville. "We must once, complain occurred Lady Harriet, she would exceedingly displeased, certainly ingenious little gentleman getting scrapes!" Harry told upon himself, however, his return home, he always accustomed so, knowing Major Graham his grandmama never angry fault confessed repented of, therefore he went straight stairs, related his whole history uncle David, gave serious exhortation foolish sinful vice gambling. To keep mind his silly adventure day, Harry also desired, whole evening, wear his coat turned inside out, frequent punishment administered Major Graham small offences, generally felt terrible disgrace. CHAPTER XIV. THE UNEXPECTED EVENT. His shout may ring upon hill, His voice echoed hall, His merry laugh like music trill, I scarcely notice things now. Willis. Some weeks Frank left home, lady Harriet Major Graham absent Holiday House, Harry Laura felt surprised observe, Mrs. Crabtree suddenly became grave silent,--her voice seemed lost half loudness,--her countenance looked rather pale,--and escaped scolded several occasions, Harry could think he deserved it. Once twice he ventured things times he dared attempted, "merely experiment," he said, "like man menagerie, put his head lion's mouth, without feeling quite sure whether would bit next moment not;" though Mrs. Crabtree evidently saw passed, she turned away look sadness, said word. What could matter? Harry almost wished she would fly good passion scold him, became extraordinary unnatural see Mrs. Crabtree sitting day corner room, sewing silence, scarcely looking her work; still wonder grew, she seemed become worse worse every day. Harry dressed cat old cap frock Laura's,--he terrified old Jowler putting shower-bath,--and let crackers nursery window,--but seemed he might fired cannon without scolded Mrs. Crabtree, merely turned her head round minute, silently resumed her work. Laura even fancied Mrs. Crabtree tears, seemed quite impossible, she thought it, till one morning, begun despair ever hearing business, whispering together corner room, observing she looked duller ever, surprised hear Mrs. Crabtree calling come near her. She looked pale, beginning say something, her voice suddenly became husky indistinct, she seemed unable proceed; therefore, motioning her hand go away, she began sewing rapidly, she done before, breaking her threads, pricking her fingers, every stitch. Laura Harry silently looked apprehension, nursery became perfectly still, feather falling ground would heard. This continued time, last Laura upon tiptoe stole quietly Mrs. Crabtree sitting, said her, kind anxious voice, "I afraid well, Mrs. Crabtree! Grandmama send doctor she comes home. Shall I ask her?" "You kind, Miss Laura!--never mind me! Your grandmama knows matter. It one hundred years hence," answered Mrs. Crabtree, low husky voice. "This thing glad hear!--you must prepare told good news!" added she, forcing laugh, laugh Harry Laura never heard before, sounded much like sorrow joy. They waited great suspense hear would follow, Mrs. Crabtree, struggling speak composure, suddenly started her seat, hurried rapidly room. She appeared nursery day, next morning breakfast, she entered room her face much covered her bonnet, evidently tried speak her usual loud bustling voice, though somehow still sounded perfectly different common. "Well, children! Lady Harriet kind promise secret kept till I pleased, one mention myself. I going away!" "You!" exclaimed Harry, looking earnestly Mrs. Crabtree's face. "Are going away?" "Yes, Master Harry,--I leave house to-day! Now, do not pretend look sorry! I know not! I cannot bear children tell stories. Who would ever sorry cross old woman like me?" "But perhaps I sorry! Are real earnest going away?" asked Harry again, renewed astonishment. "Oh no! joke!" "Do I look joke?" asked Mrs. Crabtree, turning round her face, bathed tears. "No, no! I come bid long farewell. A fine mess get now! All things going rack ruin, nobody fit look them!" "But, Mrs. Crabtree! like go away," said Laura, kindly. "Why leaving us sudden? odd! I never surprised life!" "Your papa's orders come. He wrote line weeks ago, say I severe. Perhaps true. I meant well, poor creatures, act best. However, cannot helped now! There is use lamenting spilt cream. You will better behaved afterwards. If ever think again, children, let kindly possible. Many many time I shall remember both. I never cared young people yourselves, I shall never take charge others. Master Frank best boy world, would good care,--but matter now!" "But matter great deal," cried Harry, eagerly. "You must stay here, Mrs. Crabtree, long live, great deal longer! I shall write letter papa it. We troublesome, faults punished. Never mind, Mrs. Crabtree, take bonnet sit down! I going dreadful mischief to-night, wanted keep order." Mrs. Crabtree laid her hand upon Harry's head silence, something solemn serious her manner, he saw would useless remonstrate more. She held her hand Laura, endeavouring smile she so, vain attempt, her lip quivered, she turned away, saying, "Who would ever believe I make fool myself! Farewell both! let nobody speak ill I gone, help it!" Without looking round, Mrs. Crabtree hurried nursery closed door, leaving Harry Laura perfectly bewildered astonishment sudden event, seemed like dream reality. They felt exceedingly melancholy, hardly able believe she formerly cross, stood window tears eyes, watching departure her well-known blue chest, wheel-barrow, taking last look her red gown scarlet shawl she hastily followed it. For several weeks come, whenever door opened, Harry Laura almost expected her enter, month month elapsed, Mrs. Crabtree appeared more, till one day, earnest entreaty, Lady Harriet took drive miles country, see neat little lodging sea-side she lived, maintained herself sewing, going occasionally sick-nurse. A delightful surprise certainly never could given Harry Laura tapped cottage door, opened Mrs. Crabtree herself, started back exclamation joyful amazement, looked she could scarcely believe her eyes beholding them, laughed joke till tears running cheeks. "Is Mrs. Crabtree home?" said Harry, trying look grave. "Grandmama says may stay hour, she drives along shore," added Laura, stepping house merry face. "And do, Mrs. Crabtree?" "Very well, Miss Laura, happy see you. What tall girl become! Master Harry too! looking quite his shoulders!" After sitting time, Mrs. Crabtree insisted dinner her cottage; making Harry Laura sit side large blazing fire, she cooked delicious pancakes rapid succession, fast could eat, tossing high air first, rolling fried, large spoonful jam centre, till Harry Laura last said, unless Mrs. Crabtree supplied fresh appetites, she need make pancakes, thought even Peter Grey could scarcely finished she provided. Harry several months constantly attending school, he became great favourite boys, great torment masters, while, his part, he liked twenty times better he expected, lessons tolerably easy clever boy, he really was, games cricket foot-ball play-ground put perfectly wild joy. Every boy school seemed his particular friend, many called "the holiday-maker," because, ever holiday wished for, Harry always became leader scheme. The last morning Peter Grey's appearing school, he got name "the copper captain," Mr. Lexicon fined half-a-crown, knowing one his lessons, he brought whole sum half-pence, carrying his hat, gravely counting out, pains-taking, good-boy look, one, see him, would supposed he quite penitent sorry his misconduct; sooner he finished task ranged half-pence neatly rows along Mr. Lexicon's desk, he desired, voice thunder, leave room instantly, never return, accordingly he never did, started next day top coach Portsmouth, last peep Harry got him, he buying perfect mountain gingerbread old man's basket, eat way. Meantime Laura lessons regular day-governess, came every morning seven, never disappeared till four afternoon, so, Mrs. Crabtree remarked, "the puir thing perfectly deaved wi' edication," she made rapid progress, uncle David said would difficult decide whether she growing fastest body mind. Laura seemed born tuition none ill-tempered people, Madame Pirouette appeared constant state irritability. During music-lessons, she sat close piano, pair sharp-pointed scissors her hand, whenever Laura played wrong note, she stuck points offending finger, saying sometimes angry foreign accent, "put toe upon 'dis note! I tell you, put toe upon 'dis note!" "My finger, I suppose mean?" asked Laura, trying laugh. "Ah! fingare toe! dat one! Speak word! take hold tongue." "Laura!" said Major Graham, one day, "I would soon hear gong sounded ear half hour, fine pieces perform now. Taste expression quite date, chief object ambition is, seem four hands instead two, torrent notes produced once. If ever wish please old-fashioned ears, give melody,--something touches heart dwells memory,--then years afterwards, hear again, language seems familiar feelings, listen deep delight sounds recalling thousand recollections former days, brought back music (real music) distinctness interest nothing else equal." During two years, Harry Laura rapidly advancing education, received many interesting letters Frank, expressing affectionate anxiety hear well happy, his paper filled amusing accounts various wonderful countries he visited; bottom paper, he always kindly remembered send order his banker, he called uncle David, drawn proper form, saying, "Please pay Master Harry Miss Laura Graham sum five shillings account. Francis Arthur Graham." In Frank's gay, merry epistles, he kept his little annoyances vexations himself, invariably took pen desire send cheerfulness his beloved home, his letters might written sun-beam, full warmth vivacity. It seemed always fair wind Frank, he looked upon best side every thing, never teazed his absent friends complaints distresses could remedy, except he frequently mentioned his sorrow separated them, adding, he often wished possible meet one day every year, tell his thoughts, hear return, sometimes now, night watches, resources failed, he entertained himself, imagining circle home gathered around him, inventing individual would say upon subjects he liked, his adventures acquired double interest, considering recital would one day amuse his dear friends happy meeting last took place. Frank over-anxious his comfort, feel much irritated discomposed privations fell his way, sitting middle dark night, rain pouring torrents, wind blowing perfect hurricane, he drew his watch-coat round him, saying good humouredly his grumbling companions, "This means bad! whatever change takes place now, probably better. Sunshine sure come Christmas, wait it, meantime comfortably St. Patrick, he swim across stormy sea, his head his arm." Frank often amused his messmates stories he heard uncle David, soon became greatest favourite imaginable all, he frequently endeavoured lead minds sure foundation happiness he always found best security his own. He long taught know vessel might well steered without rudder compass, individual brought peace, unless directed Holy Scriptures; his delight frequently study passages these: "When thou passest waters, I thee; rivers, shall overflow thee; thou walkest fire, thou shalt burned; neither shall flame kindle upon thee. For I Lord thy God, Holy One Israel, thy Saviour." CHAPTER XV. AN UNEXPECTED VOYAGE. Full little know'st thou, hast tried, How strange "steam-boat" long bide,-- To fret thy soul crosses cares, To eat thy heart comfortless despairs, To speed to-day--to put back to-morrow-- To feed hope--to pine fear sorrow. Spenser. As Harry Laura grew older, gradually treated like friends companions Lady Harriet Major Graham, improved minds frequent interesting conversations, knowledge principle insensibly instilled minds, formal instruction, merely mentioning facts, expressing opinions sentiments naturally arose subjects discussion, accustoming young people feel certain remarks thoughts heard interest person. No surprise expressed, appeared acute amusing might expected,--no angry contempt betrayed spoke foolishly, unless something positively wrong; thus Major Graham Lady Harriet succeeded making difficult transition treating children toys, becoming confidential friends, trusted, well respected beloved associates. Frank upwards five years cruizing various stations abroad, many officers seen him, gave agreeable reports Major Graham his admirable conduct several occasions, his turned extremely handsome pleasing, Lady Harriet often wished, tears her eyes, possible she might live see again, though her daily increasing infirmities rendered hope every hour improbable. She told he spoke her frequently, said he met aged person Cape, "I would give I possess earth, ten times more, I it, see dear grandmother well, meet her more." This deeply affected Lady Harriet, speaking one day unusual earnestness comfort gave, whatever might Providence respect herself, Frank seemed happy, liked his profession well, door flew open, Andrew hastened room, his old face perfectly wrinkled delight, he displayed letter his hand, saying tone breathless agitation, he delivered Major Graham, "The post-mark Portsmouth, Sir!" Lady Harriet nearly rose her seat exclamation joy, unable exertion, she sunk back, covering her face her hands, listening speechless suspense hear whether Frank indeed returned. Harry Laura eagerly looked Major Graham's shoulder, Andrew lingered anxiously door, till welcome letter hurriedly torn open read. The direction certainly Frank's writing, though seemed different usual, contents filled Major Graham degree consternation alarm, he vainly endeavoured conceal, informed that, desperate engagement slave-ships coast Africa, Frank severely wounded, he scarcely recovered violent attack fever reduced extremely, doctors declared his chance restoration invalided home immediately; "therefore," added he, "you must unite prayer recovery, thanksgiving return, I scarcely regret illness restores home. My heart already all, frail shattered body must rest days London, voyage Sierra Leone extremely fatiguing tedious." Lady Harriet made single remark letter closed, tears coursed rapidly her aged cheeks, she slowly removed her hands her face, gazed Major Graham, seated her side, evident agitation, calling back Andrew he leaving room, he said, accents unusual emotion, "Desire John inquire immediately whether steam-boat sails London to-day." "You right!" said Lady Harriet, feebly. "Oh! I could accompany you! But bring possible. I dare hope go. Surely shall meet last. Now indeed I feel weakness, I cannot fly see him. But he quite able journey. Frank excellent constitution,--he--he was--" Lady Harriet's voice failed, she burst convulsive agony tears. A hours, uncle David embarked London, where, short passage, he arrived his usual lodgings St. James' Place; days elapsed, he laboured vain discover smallest trace Frank, omitted, his hurried letter Portsmouth, mention he intended living town. One evening, fatigued his long unavailing search, Major Graham sat down, British Coffee-house, take refreshment resuming his inquiries, afterwards leave room, he observed tall interesting young man, exceedingly emaciated, strolled languidly room, feeble step, he scarcely seemed able support himself. The stranger took his hat, sunk seat, passed his fingers dark masses curls hung his pale white forehead, his large eyes closed heavily fatigue, his cheek assumed hectic glow, his head sunk upon his hand. In low subdued voice he gave directions waiter, Major Graham, gazing moment melancholy interest apparently consumptive youth, depart, turn young man's countenance caused start; he looked earnestly--every fibre his frame seemed suddenly thrill apprehension, last, voice doubt astonishment, he exclaimed, "Frank!" The stranger sprung his seat, gazed eagerly round room, rushed arms Major Graham, fainted. Long anxiously uncle David watch restoration Frank, every means used revive him, length he regain his consciousness, time lost conveying St. James' Place, where, confined bed, attended Sir Astley Cooper Sir Henry Halford, days, united recommending he carried miles town, neighbourhood Hammersmith, change air, till effect medicine diet could fully tried. Frank earnestly entreated he might taken immediately his home, doctors pronounced quite impossible, privately hinting Major Graham seemed doubtful indeed whether he could ever moved all, whether he might survive months. "Home anywhere family live me," said Frank tone resignation, he heard journey Scotland pronounced impossible. "It I am, I see, signifies; meeting you, uncle David, good ocean physic. Oh! I could converse grandmama half-an-hour, speak dear Harry Laura, would much happiness. I want see much grown, hear merry laugh again. Perhaps I never may! But I get worse, must come here. I many things say! Why set now?--immediately! If I recover, might happy party Scotland again. For grandmama, I know impossible; write ask her Harry Laura? The sooner better, uncle David, I often think probable----" Frank coloured hesitated; he looked earnestly his uncle moments, saw meant, added, "There one person more, far distant, little thinking come, must told. You always father me, uncle David, he also would wish now. Little together, I know much he loves me." Frank's request became sooner known complied Lady Harriet, thought better distress Harry Laura, mentioning full extent his danger, merely said, he felt impatient meeting, might prepare following day, embark charge old Andrew her maid Harrison, voyage London, she hoped would find dear invalid already better; Laura astonished agitation she spoke, felt bewildered amazed sudden announcement. She Harry twice lives caught cold, spent day bed, confined diet gruel syrup, always proved infallible remedy worst attacks, frequently witnessed severe sufferings grandmama, which, however, she always recovered, seemed natural effects her extreme old age; imagine possibility Frank's life actual danger, never crossed thoughts instant, and, therefore, feeling unutterable joy stood deck Royal Pandemonium, knowing actually going meet Frank. Nothing could greater novelty young travellers scene surrounded; trumpets sounding--bells ringing--children crying--sailors, passengers, carriages, dogs, baggage hurrying board pell-mell, jet steam came bellowing forth waste-pipe, struggling get rid huge column black smoke vomited forth chimney. Below stairs still astonished find large cabin, covered gilding, red damask, mirrors, crowds strange-looking people, half sick, cross, scolding bustling about, bawling carpet bags, trying much consequence possible, ate drank trash, keep sea-sickness, might made one sick shore--sipping brandy water, eating peppermint drops, according case required. Among ladies' cabin, Laura Harry amused discover Miss Perceval, hastened bed already, case ill, talking unceasingly one would listen, besides ordering scolding poor sick maid, scarcely able stand. Her head enveloped singular night-cap, ornamented old ribbons artificial flowers--she wore bright yellow shawl, taken berth beside her, little Blenheim spaniel--a parrot--and cage canary birds, noisy inhabitants sung full pitch voices till latest hour night, kept awake lamp swung side side, nothing could compared volubility except perpetual clamour occasioned Miss Perceval herself. "I declare little narrow beds better coffins! I never saw places! smell like singed blankets cabbages boiled melted oil! It enough make anybody ill! Mary! go fetch cup tea, and, hear! tell people deck make noise--it gives headache! Be sure say I shall complain Captain. Reach bread milk parrot,--fetch smelling bottle,--go saloon book I reading,--and search pocket-handkerchief I mislaid. It cost ten guineas, must found. I hope one stolen it! Now make haste tea! What dawdling for? If stop noise deck, Mary, I shall exceedingly displeased! Some horrid people steerage smoking too, tell Captain I come he must forbid them. It trick make us sick save provisions. I observed gun-case saloon too, dangerous thing, guns always go least expect. If one fires, I shall fall hysterics. I shall, indeed! What creaking noise vessel makes! I hope danger splitting! We ought go sailing dusk. The Captain must positively cast anchor night, may noise motion, sleep peace quietness till morning." Soon Royal Pandemonium set sail, rather set fire, wind freshened, pitching vessel became rough, Harry Laura, great difficulty, staggered seats deck, leaving Lady Harriet's servants sick below, instead able attend them, gave nine times trouble passenger board, visible whole voyage. The two young travellers sat together, watched, great curiosity, several groups strangers deck: ladies, half sick, trying entertain gentlemen seal-skin travelling caps pale cadaverous countenances, smoking cigars; others opening baskets provisions, eating good sea-faring appetite; one party carriage deck filled luxuries every kind, seemed end multitude Perigord pies, German sausages, cold fowls, pastry, fruit produced evening. The owners table spread deck, ate voraciously, circle hungry spectators, appearance selfishness gluttony, his young friends thought immediately Peter Grey. As evening closed in, Harry Laura began feel desolate thus first time lives alone, wide waste waters around made scene yet forlorn. They enjoyed unmingled delight talking happy meeting Frank, planned hundred times joyfully would rush house, pleasure would relate happened themselves, hearing his mouth extraordinary adventures his letters described. Laura produced her reticule several last she received, laughed funny jokes stories contained, inventing many new questions ask subject, fancying she already heard his voice, saw his bright joyous countenance. But night grown dark chilly, Harry Laura felt gradually becoming cold, melancholy, dejected. They made effort walk arm-in-arm deck, imitation passengers able remain bed, tried still talk cheerfully, spite every effort, thoughts became mournful. After clinging together time, staggering down, without feeling spirits speak, still shiveringly cold, yet unwilling separate night, Harry suddenly stood still, grasping Laura's arm look startled astonishment, caused her hastily glance round direction he eagerly gazing, nothing became visible except dim outline woman's figure, rolled several enormous shawls, her bonnet slouched far her face. "I certain her!" whispered Harry, tone breathless amazement; "almost certain!" "Who?" asked Laura, eagerly. Without answering, Harry sprung forward, seized unknown person arm, instantly looked round.----IT WAS MRS. CRABTREE! "I sorry observed me, Master Harry! I intend trouble Miss Laura voyage," said she, turning her face slowly towards him, when, his surprise, he saw traces tears her cheek, her manner appeared subdued, altogether different former times, Laura could scarcely yet credit her senses. "I shall way, children, I ---- ---- I must see Master Frank again. He always good world, he will long--Andrew told it, I could stay behind. I wish well prepared, sooner die better." Harry Laura listened speechless consternation words. The idea losing Frank never crossed imaginations moment, could wished believe Mrs. Crabtree said like ravings delirium, yet irresistible feeling awe alarm rushed minds. "Miss Laura! want help undressing, call time. I sure doited body Harrison could service. She never fit take care herself, far less you. It put wild think coming way nobody fit look you, distress must follow." "But surely, Mrs. Crabtree, think Frank ill," asked Laura, making effort recover her voice, speaking tone deep anxiety; "he recovered fever, rather weak travelling." "Well, Miss Laura! grief always comes soon, I would held tongue I thought know worst already. If I might order former days, would send directly, heavy fog cold wind." "But may order us, Mrs. Crabtree," said Harry, taking her kindly hand; "we glad see again! I shall whatever bid me! So came way purpose us! How kind!" "Master Harry, I would go round wide world serve one you! else I care for? But chiefly see Master Frank. Let us hope best, pray prepared event may come. All things ordained good, make best happens. The world must go round,--it must go round, cannot prevent it." Harry Laura hung heads dismay, something agitated solemn Mrs. Crabtree's manner, astonished shocked them, hurried silently bed; Laura's pillow drenched tears anxiety distress night, though gradually, she thought Frank's bright colour sparkling eyes, his joyous spirits unbroken health, seemed impossible soon fade away, wind already passed them, gone, till degrees her mind became calm; her hopes grew certainties; she told herself twenty times over, Mrs. Crabtree must entirely mistaken, last sunk restless agitated slumber. Next day sun shone, sky clear, every thing appeared full life joy, Harry Laura would fancied whole scene Mrs. Crabtree distressing dream, awakened recollection six morning, sound her voice, angrily rebuking Miss Perceval ladies, good reason, grumbling hardship sleeping, rather vainly attempting sleep, narrow uncomfortable dog-holes. Laura heard Mrs. Crabtree conclude eloquent oration subject contentment, saying, "Indeed, ladies! many brave man, noblemen's sons too, laid heads green grass, fighting you, put hard bed patiently one night." Miss Perceval turned angrily away, summoned her maid receive multitude new directions. "Mary, tell Captain I looked last, scarcely smoke coming funnel, I sure he saving fuel, keeping good enough fires carry us on! I never knew shabbiness! Tell engineer, I insist his throwing coals immediately. Bring hot water, fast possible! These towels coarse, I cannot, account, use them. After accustomed pocket-handkerchiefs mine, ten guineas each, one become particular. Can find larger basin? This looks like soup-plate, seems impossible get enough hot water wash comfortably." "She put boiler steam-boat," muttered Mrs. Crabtree. "I wish animal-magnifying doctors would put young lady sleep till arrive London." "Now!" continued Miss Perceval, "get another cup tea. The last sweet, one strong enough, first half cold, worse any. Do remember mention, yesterday night steward sent tin tea-pot, thing I cannot possibly suffer again. We must urn, too, instead black tea-kettle; desire prepare butter-toast--I hungry, three rounds enough. Let green tea time; see cream better last night, I certain thickened chalk snails. The jelly, too, execrable, tasted like sticking-plaster--I shall starve better cannot had; table-cloth looked like pair old sheets. Tell steward this, say, he must get breakfast ready deck half hour; meantime, I shall sit book brush hair." The sick persecuted maid seemed anxious she bid; so, delivering many messages possible, she tried stand Miss Perceval's hair, motion vessel greatly increased, she turned pale death, apparently point sinking ground, Laura, quite dressed, quietly slipped brush her hand, carefully brushed Miss Perceval's thin locks, poor Mary silently dropped upon seat, perfectly faint sickness. Miss Perceval read on, without observing change abigails, till Harry, watched whole scene cabin-door, made hissing noise, grooms currycomb horse, caused young lady look hastily round, great Miss Perceval's astonishment discover her new abigail, pains-taking look, brushing her hair, poor Mary lay dead alive benches. "Well! I declare! ever anything odd!" she exclaimed voice amazement. "How strange! What matter Mary! There end plague servants!" "Or rather plague mistresses!" thought Laura, she glanced Miss Perceval's round, red bustling face, poor suffering maid, became worse worse day, came sailors call "a capful wind," gradually rose "stiff breeze," or, passengers considered hurricane; and, towards night, attained dignity real undeniable "storm." A scene indescribable tumult ensued. The Captain attempted make his voice heard roaring tempest, using torrent unintelligible nautical phrases, incessant volley intelligible oaths. The sailors flew about, every plank vessel seemed creaking straining, high all, shrill tones Miss Perceval audibly heard, exclaiming, "Are enough 'hands' board? Is danger? Are sure boiler burst? I wish steam-boats never invented! People sure blown clouds, sunk bottom ocean, scalded death like many lobsters. I cannot stand longer! Stop ship, set shore instantly!" Laura clung closer Harry, felt like two mere pigmies, amid wide waste waters, rolling tossing around them, his spirits, contrary, rose highest pitch excitement he heard saw, till length, wishing enjoy "fun," he determined venture board. By time Harry's nose level deck, he gazed around, saw person appeared visible except two sailors, lashed helm, silent now, except deafening noise made wild waves stormy blast, seemed would blow his teeth his throat. Harry thought two men looked larger mice scene, stood, clinging bannisters, perfectly entranced astonishment admiration novelty he saw, thinking often Frank must scenes, suddenly wave washed quite deck, he felt his arm grasped Mrs. Crabtree, desired come immediately, tone authority he even yet feel bold enough disobey; therefore, slowly reluctantly he descended cabin, living thing seemed well enough move, Miss Perceval's tongue. "Steward!" she cried, sharp angry accents. "Steward! water pouring sky-lights like shower-bath! Look band-box swimming floor! Mary! Tiresome creature! do not see that? My best bonnet destroyed! Send Captain here! He must positively stop noise deck; quite intolerable. My head aches, would burst like boiler steam-boat! Stupid man! Cannot he put port, cast anchor? How he keep us uncomfortable way! Mary! Mary, I say! deaf? Steward! send one sailors take care dog! I declare poor Frisk going sick! Mary! Mary! This insufferable! I wish Captain would come help scold maid! I shall certainly give warning, Mary." This awful threat little effect one thought herself brink buried beneath waves, besides sick care whether she died next minute not; even Miss Perceval's voice became drowned last tremendous storm raged throughout night, Captain rather increased Laura's panic, possible, considerately putting his head cabin say, "Do not afraid, ladies! There danger!" "But I must come see about, Captain!" exclaimed Miss Perceval. "You better still, madam," replied Mrs. Crabtree. "It well drowned bed deck." Nothing gives awful idea helplessness man, wrath God, tempestuous sea gloom midnight; every mind board became awed silence solemnity war elements, till length, towards morning, hurricane seemed yet raging undiminished fury, Laura suddenly gave exclamation rapture, hearing sailor helm begin sing Tom Bowling. "Now I feel sure danger over," said she, "otherwise man could heart sing! If I live century, I shall always like sailor's song future." It seldom person's thankfulness danger bears fair proportion fear felt lasted; Harry Laura taught remember gratitude due, felt deeply next day, entered Yarmouth Roads, shewn masts several vessels, appearing partly water, various occasions, lost wilderness shoals, many melancholy catastrophes occurred. After sailing Thames, duly staring Greenwich hospital, hulks, Tower London, landed last; offered Mrs. Crabtree place hackney coach, hurried impatiently it, eager happy moment meeting Frank. Harry, his ardour, thought carriage ever driven slowly before. He wished rail-road town; far wasting thought upon novelties Holborn Piccadilly, he Laura gained idea metropolis, distinct Irishman complained he could see London quantity houses. One idea filled hearts, brightened countenances, looked smile delight, saying, "now, last, going see Frank!" CHAPTER XVI. THE ARRIVAL. What life?----a varied tale, Deeply moving, quickly told. Willis. "Oh! lovely cottage!" exclaimed Laura, ecstacy joy, stopped beautiful house, large airy windows ground; walls seemed one brilliant mass roses; rich flowery meadows front, bright smooth lawn behind, stretching broad bosom Thames, reflected glassy surface innumerable boats, filled gay groups merry people. "That place I often dreamed of, never saw before! It seems made perfect happiness!" "Yes! delightful live Frank uncle David!" added Harry. "We shall sailing water day!" The cottage gate opened, Major Graham appeared porch; instead hurrying forward, he always formerly did, welcome shortest separation, he stood gravely silently door, without much raising his eyes ground; paleness his countenance filled Harry Laura astonishment. They flew meet him, making exclamation joy; embracing affectionately, he utter word, led way hurried agitated steps sitting room. "Where Frank?" exclaimed Harry, looking eagerly round. "Why he here? Call down! Tell come!" A long pause ensued; Laura trembled she looked her uncle, moments he could speak, sat taking hand, look sorrow commiseration, filled alarm. "My dear Harry Laura!" said he solemnly, "you never known grief till now, love me, listen composure. I sad news tell, yet greatest consequence bear fortitude. Frank extremely ill; joy he felt coming, agitated much, he worse possibly conceive. It probably depends upon conduct now, whether he survives night not. Frank knows here; he impatient embrace him; he becomes agitated every moment meeting delayed; yet give way childish grief, even childish joy, upon seeing again, Doctors think may his immediate death. You might hear his breathing part house. He lowest extreme weakness! It dreadful scene both. Tell me, Harry Laura, trust yourselves? Can you, Frank's sake, enter his room moment, quietly seen yesterday, speak composure?" Laura felt, hearing words, earth opened her feet,--a choking sensation arose her throat,--her colour fled,--her limbs shook,--her whole countenance became convulsed anguish,--but making resolute effort, she looked anxiously Harry, said, low, almost inaudible voice, "Uncle David! able,--God strengthen us. I dare think moment. The sooner done better. Let us go now." Major Graham slowly led way without speaking, till reach bed-room door, he paused moment, Harry Laura listened gasping sound Frank struggling breath. "Remember scarcely know him," whispered he, looking doubtfully Laura's pallid countenance; "but single expression emotion may fatal. Show love Frank now, dear children. Spare agitation,--forget feelings his sake." When Harry Laura entered room, Frank buried his face his hands, leaned table, saying, convulsive accents, "Go away, Laura!--oh go away now! I cannot bear yet!--leave me!--leave me!" If Laura turned marble moment, she could seemed perfectly calm, her mind wound almost supernatural effort, advancing place he sat, without attempting speak, she took Frank hand--Harry same; sound heard moments, convulsive struggles Frank himself, he gasped breath, vainly tried speak, till length he raised his head fixed his eyes Laura, felt then, first time, struck dreadful conviction, meeting prelude immediate final separation. The pale ashy cheek, hollow eye, sharp altered features, told tale anguish she never conceived, cold tremor passed her frame, she stood amazed bewildered grief, past, present, future seemed one mighty heap agony. Still she gazed steadily Frank, said nothing, conscious smallest indulgence emotion would bring forth torrent nothing could control, determined, unless her heart ceased beat, he see nothing increase his agitation. At length, low, faint, broken voice, Frank able speak, looking affectionate sympathy Laura, he said, "Do think, dear sister, I always suffer see now. This joy much me. I shall soon feel easier." Major Graham observed livid paleness come Laura's countenance she attempted answer, seeing impossible sustain trial moment longer, he made pretext hurry her away. Harry instantly followed, rushing vacant room, he threw agony grief, wept convulsively, till bed shook beneath him. Hours passed on, Major Graham left exhaust grief weeping together, every moment seemed increase agitation, conviction became fearfully certain Frank indeed lost ever. This meeting often, joyously anticipated! Laura sunk upon her knees beside Harry, prayers mingled tears, asked consolation, tried feel resigned. "Alas!" thought she solemnly, "how truly grandmama say, 'If sorrows world called 'light afflictions,' must Christ died save us!' It merciful forbid weep, for, oh! ever lost brother?--the kindest--the best brothers!--dear, dear Frank!--can nothing done! Uncle David!" added Laura, clinging Major Graham, he entered room, "oh! say something us Frank getting better,--do think he will? May hope?--one single hope live upon, Frank may possibly spared; turn away--do look sad--think young Frank is,--and Doctors skilful--and--and oh, uncle David! he dying! I see it! I must believe it!" continued she, wringing her hands grief. "You cannot give us one word hope, though whole world would nothing without him." "My dear,--my dear Laura! remember consoling text holy Scripture, 'Be still, know I God;'--we idea He saving us sorrow, comforting us comes, therefore let us seek peace Him, believe shall indeed ordered well, even though hearts broken affliction. Frank seen old nurse Crabtree, refreshing sleep, therefore I wish take opportunity sitting his room, accustoming yourselves, possible, sight his altered appearance. He sometimes cheerful, always patient, therefore must keep spirits, try assist bearing his sufferings, rather increase them, showing feel ourselves. I pleased morning--that meeting common effort, must show submission Divine will, difficult may be, deep, heartfelt resignation whatever He ordains." Harry Laura still felt stupified grief, mechanically followed Major Graham Frank's room, sat distant corner behind his chair, observing awe astonishment his pallid countenance, his emaciated hands, his drooping figure, scarcely yet able believe indeed beloved Frank. After remained immoveably still time, though shedding many bitter tears, gazed wreck one dear, he suddenly started awake, glanced anxiously round room, look deep disappointment, he said uncle David, low, feeble accents, "It dream! I often dreamed thing, far away sea,--that would much happiness! I fancied Harry Laura here!" "It dream, dear Frank! here," said Laura, trying speak quiet, subdued voice. "My dear sister! well! pray sit always I see you. After wishing long meeting, appears nearly impossible together last." Frank became exhausted speaking much, pointed seat near himself, Harry Laura sat down, he gazed long earnestly, look affectionate pleasure, his smile, lost former cheerfulness, full tenderness sensibility. At length his countenance gradually changed, large tears gathered his eyes, coursed silently his cheeks. Thoughts deepest sadness seemed passing his mind moments, checking heavy sigh rose his breast, he riveted his hands together, looked towards heaven expression placid submission, saying words scarcely audible tone, though evidently addressed around, "Weeping endureth night, joy cometh morning." "We know earthly house tabernacle dissolved, building God, house made hands, eternal heavens." "Weep ye dead, neither bemoan him; _but_ weep sore goeth away: he shall return more, see his native country."[1] [1] Jeremiah xxii. 10. These words fell upon ear Harry Laura like knell death, saw Frank believed he dying, appeared last spark hope expired heard terrible dispensation announced his lips. He seemed anxious understand his full meaning, receive consolation his mind could afford, he closed his eyes, added solemn accents, "I must died time, now? If I leave friends dear earth, I go chief best friend heaven. The whole peace comfort mind rest thinking Saviour's merits. Let us ready say, 'the Lord done.' Think often, Harry Laura, words frequently repeated grandmama formerly: 'Take comfort, Christians, friends In Jesus fall asleep, Their better never ends, Why dejected weep? Why inconsolable To hope given? Death messenger peace, And calls 'my' soul Heaven.'" Frank's voice failed, his head fell back upon pillows, he remained length time, his eyes closed solemn meditation prayer, Laura Harry, unable much look other, leaned upon table, wept silence. Laura felt she grown old moment,--as life could give joy--and she herself stood already verge grave. It appeared like dream she ever happy, dreadful reality she awakened. "Behold, God taketh away! hinder him? say unto him, What doest thou?" "Cease ye man, whose breath his nostrils." These texts forced her mind, mournful emphasis, she felt helpless earthly affection dispensations God upon us. All her love Frank could avert stroke death,--all his attachment her must buried grave,--and tenderness felt other, embittered sorrows dreadful moment. From day, Harry Laura, according advice uncle David, testified affection Frank, tears useless lamentations, though always controlled private, incessant, devoted attention watched his looks, anticipated his wishes, thought every exertion pleasure could slightest degree contribute his comfort. Frank, his part, spared feelings, often concealing he suffered, speaking his death, journey he must prepare readiness enter, reminding them, never die, never happy, saw endure sickness, became nothing he endured struggling sin temptation, great evils existence,--and he would ever freed death. "Those prepared change," added he, solemnly, "can neither live long, die soon; God gives us His blessing, He sends heaven, were, soul soul ascends heaven; I trust gifted faith submission may ordained remaining hours upon earth." Yet, every desire feel resigned, Frank sometimes surprised his usual fortitude, especially thinking he must never hope see Lady Harriet, towards he cast many longing affecting thought, saying once, deep emotion, "If I could see grandmama again, I feel quite well!" One evening, he sat near open window, gazing rich tints twilight, breathing usual ease, wandering musician paused her guitar, sung several airs great pathos expression. At length she played tune "Home! sweet home," Frank listened moments intense agitation, till, clasping his hands bursting tears, he exclaimed, accents powerful emotion, "Home! That happy home! Oh! never--never more,--_my_ home grave." Laura wept convulsively he added broken accents, "I shall still remembered--still lamented--you must love well, Laura,--not I love you, sorrow would great; long hence, Harry happy together, surrounded friends, think sometimes one must ever absent,--who loved better all,--whose last prayer both. Oh! tell feelings are! I nothing distress anguish love best!" "Frank, I would exchange affection wealth worlds. As long I live, greatest earthly happiness brother; suffer sorrow I cannot name, dare think of, teaching bear it, leaving us comfort have, knowing happy." "Many plans many hopes I future, Laura," added Frank; "but future world. Perhaps I may escape multitude sorrows, gladly would I shared yours, ensured best happiness uniting Harry living God. If learn death life, then, indeed, I rejoice. With respect myself, matters little years hours sooner, I may say, words Job, 'though He slay me, yet I trust Him.'" Frank's sufferings increased every day, became great last, Doctor proposed giving strong doses laudanum, bring stupor allay pain; mentioned him, he said, "I know duty take whatever prescribe, I certainly shall, without opiates, let entreat refrain them. Often formerly sea I used think sad I attended sickness allowed physician die possession senses, account made take laudanum, gave false spirits temporary ease. Let retain faculties long mercifully granted me. I bear pain,--at least, God grant strength so,--but I cannot willingly enter presence Creator state little short intoxication." Many days agony followed resolution part Frank, though medicine, would brought hours oblivion, lay within reach, he persevered wishing preserve his consciousness, whatever suffering might cost; though prayer bodily relief wrung his acute agony, frequent fervent supplications he uttered night day were, accent intense emotion, "God mercy upon soul." Harry Laura surprised find fields walks near London rural beautiful appeared Hammersmith, meet much simplicity kindness among common people anticipated. The poorer neighbours, became aware affliction, testified degree sympathy frequently astonished them, often afterwards remembered pleasure, one instance seemed peculiarly touching Laura. Frank always suffered acutely night, seldom closed his eyes sleep till morning, therefore she invariably remained him, beguile weary hours, remonstrance his part fatiguing duty, became mere waste words, she grew sadder paler, saying, would time enough take care herself she could longer use him. The earliest thing gave relief Frank's cough every day, generally was, tumbler milk, warm cow, ordered him, brought almost soon dawn light. Once, Frank unusually ill, sighed restless agony till morning, Laura watched impatiently day, milkman seen, six of the clock, slowly trudging fields, advancing leisurely towards house, Laura hurried eagerly meet him, exclaiming accents joy, she held tumbler, "Oh! I glad come last!" "At last, Miss!! I early usual!" replied he, gruffly. "It is many poor folks gets soon work, labour hard day, would maybe think morning came soon." "I seldom bed night," answered Laura, sadly. "My poor sick brother cannot rest till milk brought, I wait him, hour hour till daylight, wearying come." The old dairyman looked sorrowful surprise Laura, she, thinking passed, hurried away; next morning, sitting Frank, she became surprised observe milkman whole hour earlier usual, plodding along towards his cattle peculiarly rapid pace. He stayed five minutes, milking one cow, though others gathered round him, soon he filled his little pail, he came straight toward Major Graham's cottage, knocked door. Laura instantly ran thank her whole heart his kind attention, which, long Frank continued ill, old dairyman rose long his usual time, bring welcome refreshment. Frank desired Laura beg he would take much trouble, else insist his accepting remuneration, old man would neither discontinue custom, receive recompense. "Let see kind good dairyman, thank myself," said Frank, one night, he felt rather easier; next morning, Laura invited poor Teddy Collins walk stairs, looked exceedingly astonished, though much pleased proposal, saying, "May be, Madam, poor young gentleman would like see stranger like me!" "No one stranger feels done," replied Laura, leading way, Frank's countenance lighted smile pleasure entered his room. He held his thin emaciated hand Teddy, looked earnestly sorrowfully his face he grasped hold it, saying, "You look poorly, Sir! I am afraid, indeed, sadly ill." "That I am! ill one side eternity! My tale told, days numbered; I would go world without saying grateful feel attention. As cup cold water given Christian kindness shall hereafter rewarded, I trust also attention may forgotten." "You heartily welcome, Sir! It great honour poor old man like oblige anybody. I shall long able work now, seeing I upwards threescore ten, days already full labour sorrow." "To us, then, night far spent, day hand," replied Frank--"How strange seems, that, old are. I still older; feeble frame sooner worn out, body laid rest grave! Let hope already applied heart wisdom, every child earth must, sooner later, find short every thing eternity. While I appear spectacle mortality, think soon certainly must follow. May find, I do, even last extreme sickness sorrow, comfort looking forward blessings 'eye hath seen, ear heard.' Farewell, kind friend! In world shall meet more, another better." The old man, apparently unwilling withdraw, paused moments Frank ceased speak. He muttered inaudible words reply, slowly sorrowfully left room, Frank's head sunk languidly pillows, Laura retired her room, where, usual, she wept herself sleep. When Harry Laura first arrived Hammersmith, Frank felt anxious walk every day benefit health; finding made frequent excuses remaining constantly home, he invented plan induced take exercise regularly. Being early June, strawberries yet exceedingly rare, could scarcely money; Doctor allowed his patient eat fruit. Frank asked his two young attendants wander quest gardens strawberries could got, bring some. Accordingly, set one morning; long, unsuccessful search, last observed small green-house near road, one little basket window, scarcely larger thimble, containing two three delicious King seedlings, perfectly ripe. These sold five shillings; hardly waiting ascertain price, Laura seized welcome prize delight, paid spot. Every morning afterwards, her regular walk hasten Harry towards pretty little shop, talked gardener poor Frank ill, told fine fruit wanted sick brother home. One day invalid seemed much worse usual, neither Harry Laura could bear leave moment; requested Mrs. Crabtree fetch strawberries, she readily agreed do; drawing her purse shop, saying she came buy little basket fruit window, her astonishment gardener looked civil sorry, answering he would sell strawberries she offered guinea a-piece. "No!" exclaimed Mrs. Crabtree, getting rage; "then put window for? There use pretending keep shop, sell it! Give strawberries minute, here is five shillings!" "It is quite impossible," replied gardener, holding back basket. "You see, madam, every day last week little Master Miss came shop, buying strawberries young gentleman ill; look sweet mournful-like, I would disappoint world. They seem later to-day usual, are, may be, coming all; I lose day's profits, cannot helped. They shall walk nothing, please come!" When Mrs. Crabtree explained she belonged family Harry Laura, gardener looked hard her see she attempting deceive him; feeling convinced she spoke truth, he begged her carry basket his young friends, positively refusing take price. CHAPTER XVII. THE LAST BIRTH-DAY. Mere human power shall fast decay, And youthful vigour cease; But wait upon Lord, In strength shall still increase. Frank felt unnatural apathy indifference dying, he looked upon awe, though fear; he express rapturous excitement solemn occasion, knowing death appointed penalty transgression, which, though deprived sharpest sting triumphs cross, yet awfully testifies succeeding generations, living man individually merited utmost wrath God, last moment earth, even devoted Christian, must darkened gloom original sin natural corruption. Yet, "as Adam die, Christ made alive;" amidst throng consolatory affecting meditations crowded his mind great subject salvation, he kept little book carefully recorded texts reflections he considered likely strengthen his faith, comfort he left behind--saying one day Major Graham, "Tell grandmama, though days upon earth, happy! When think me, uncle David, sufferings over, may well pleasing remembrance, always best, kindest friends. Oh! kind! I must not--cannot speak that----. This birth-day!--my last birth-day! Many joyous one kept together, merry days over, sadder ones shall cease; yet time fast approaching, welcome us both, 'When death-divided friends last Shall meet part more.'" In evening, Major Graham observed Frank made Mrs. Crabtree bring everything belonging him, lay table, he employed busily tying number little parcels, remarking, languid smile, "My possessions valuable, old friends messmates, pleased receive trifling memorial one loved them. Send dirk Peter Grey, much reformed now. Here letters ever sent me; often read! now, even intercourse must end; keep them, dearest treasures I possessed. At Madras, formerly, I remember hearing nabob bringing his whole fortune home chest gold, ropes hoisting his treasure board insufficient, whole gave way, fell ocean, never recovered. That seemed sudden termination his hopes plans, scarcely unexpected own. 'We wind passeth away cometh again.' Many restless nights ordained now, probably I may find resource prayer meditation. Others afford time slumber, I soon shall sleep sleep death, becomes blessing hours solitary thought, preparing heart establishing faith, moment need." "Yes, Frank! prayers solitary, joined yours," added Laura. "I read old author lately, Christian friends world might compared travellers going along road separate carriages--sometimes together--often apart--sometimes exchange assistance, now--and often jostle other, till last, reached journey's end, removed earthly vehicles better state, shall look back upon former circumstances, know even known." Laura often astonished observe change taken place her character feelings within short period distress. Her extreme terror thunder-storm formerly, occasioned many jest her brothers, Harry used, occasionally, roll heavy weights room her own, imitate loudest peals, Frank sometimes endeavoured argue her excessive apprehension she listened distant surmise storm. Now, however, Hammersmith, long midnight, moon, one occasion, became completely obscured dense heavy clouds, air felt oppressively hot, Frank, seemed unusually breathless, drew closer window. Laura supported his head, deeply occupied talking him, suddenly broad flash lightning glared room, followed crash thunder, seemed crack heavens. Again lightning gleamed her face vividness, Laura fancied she could distinguish heat it, yet she stirred not, single exclamation, former days, arise her lips. "Pray shut window, Laura," said Frank languidly, raising his eyes; "and kind close shutters!" "Why, Frank?--you never used alarmed thunder!" "No! I now, dear Laura. What danger need dying person fear? Some hours sooner later would little consequence-- Come he slow, come he fast, It death comes last. Yet, Laura, think I forgotten old times! Oh, no!--not I live. You attend feelings, surely duty remember yours." "Never mind me, Frank!" whispered Laura. "I got folly. When real fears sorrows come, care imaginary." "True, dear sister; courage fortitude like derived faith superintending providence. Though creation reel, may sleep peace, Christians 'danger safe, tumult calm.'" When Frank grew worse, he became often delirious. Yet health he habitually cheerful, his mind generally wandered agreeable subjects. He fancied walking bright meadows, picking flowers river side,--meeting Lady Harriet,--and even speaking his father, Sir Edward present; Harry Laura listened, weeping trembling, behold wreck mind heart his. One evening, he seemed unusually well, requested his arm-chair might wheeled open window, he gazed delight hills meadows,--the clouds glittering water,--the cattle standing stream,--the boats reflected surface,--and roses fluttering every casement. "Those joyous little birds!--their song makes cheerful," said he, tone placid enjoyment. "I countries birds never sing, leaves never fade; excited sympathy interest. Here notes gladness sunshine storm, teaching us lesson grateful contentment,--while drooping roses preach sermon me, easily might recover freshness bloom myself. We shall lie low long dust, yet spring shall come hereafter revive even 'the ashes urn.' Then, uncle David, meet again,--not now, amidst sorrow suffering, death separation us,--but blessed consciousness sins forgiven,--our trials ended,--and afflictions moment, worked us far exceeding, even eternal weight glory." Some hours afterwards Doctor entered. After receiving cordial welcome Frank, feeling his pulse, he instantly examined his arms neck, covered entirely small red spots, upon observing which, friendly physician suddenly changed countenance, stole alarmed glance Major Graham. "I feel easier better to-day, Doctor, time since illness," said Frank, looking earnestly his face. "Do think eruption good? Life much would dear me, I friends like live for. Can possible I may yet recover?" The Doctor turned away, unable reply, Frank intensely watched his countenance, gazed pale agitated face Major Graham. Gradually hope brightened his cheek began fade,--the lustre his eye became dim,--his countenance settled expression mournful resignation,--and covering his face his hands, he said, voice deep emotion, "I see is!--God's done!" The silence death succeeded, Frank laid his head pillow closed his eyes. A natural tears coursed slowly his cheek; length, hour two afterwards, completely exhausted, he fell gentle sleep, Doctor considered doubtful he would ever awaken, red spots indicated mortification, must inevitably terminate his life next day. Laura retired window, making strenuous effort restrain her feelings, she might enabled witness last awful scene; fervently she pray strength sustain fortitude, might still render her use her dying brother. Her pale countenance might almost mistaken corpse, expression living agony her eye; she sunk deep, solemn thought, her attention became suddenly roused observing chariot four drive furiously gate, horses foaming panting stopped. A tall gentleman, exceedingly striking appearance, sprung hurriedly out, walked rapidly towards cottage door, another minute entered Frank's room, animated look one expected gladly welcomed, occasion agreeable surprise. Harry Laura shrunk close uncle, stranger, evident agitation, gazed round room air painful astonishment, till Major Graham looked round, instantly started exclamation amazement, "Edward! possible! This indeed consolation! still time!" "In time!!" exclaimed Sir Edward, grasping his brother's hand vehement agitation. "Do mean say Frank yet danger!" Major Graham mournfully shook his head, undrawing bed curtains, he silently pointed sleeping countenance Frank, still death, already overspread ghastly paleness. Sir Edward sunk chair, clenched his hands his forehead look unspeakable anguish, saying, under-tone, "Worn out, I am, mind body, I needed destroy me! Say once, brother, hope?" "None, dear Edward! None! Even he insensible, I fear little prospect ever becoming conscious again." At moment Frank opened his eyes, dim glassy, became evident he relapsed state temporary delirium. "Get candles! dark is!" he said. "Who people? Send away everybody grandmama! I must speak her alone. Never tell papa this, would distress him--say nothing me. Why Harry Laura never come? They absent week! Who took away uncle David too?" Laura listened time agony grief, till last, unable longer restrain her feelings, she clasped Frank her arms burst tears, exclaiming, accents piercing distress, "Oh Frank! dear Frank! forgotten poor Laura?" "Not till I dead!" whispered he, momentary gleam recollection lighted his face. "Laura! meet again." Sir Edward wished speak, Frank relapsed state feeble unconsciousness, nothing could arouse him; twice he repeated name Laura low melancholy voice, till became totally inaudible--his breath became shorter--his lips became livid--his whole frame seemed convulsed--and hours afterwards, mortal Frank Graham ceased exist. About four morning his body rest, his spirit returned God gave it. The candles burned low sockets, still mourners remained, unwilling move awful scene bereavement. Mrs. Crabtree length, laid body herself, extinguished lights, flung open window curtains. Then suddenly bright blaze sunshine streamed room, rested cold pale face dead. To stunned bewildered senses Harry Laura, brilliant dawn morning seemed like mockery distress. Many persons already passing by--the busy stir life begun, boy strolling along road whistled his merry tune he went gaily on. "We indeed mere atoms world!" thought Laura bitterly, sights sounds fell heavily her heart. "If Harry I dead also, sun would shone brightly, birds sung joyfully, people gay happy ever! Nobody thinking Frank--nobody knows misery--the world going nothing happened, breaking hearts grief!" Laura's heart became stilled she gazed peaceful almost happy expression beautiful features, lost appearance suffering. The eyes, nothing kindness love beamed upon her, closed ever; lips spoken words generous affection pious hope, silent; heart beat every warm brotherly feeling, first time insensible her sorrows; yet Laura give way strong excess her grief, sunk upon her spirit leaden weight anguish, tears lamentations could express, could even relieve. She rose kissed, last time, beloved countenance, she never look upon till met heaven, stole away silence solitude her room, Laura tried vain collect her thoughts. All seemed dreary blank. She sigh--she could weep; she sat dark vacant abstraction, one consciousness filling her mind--the bitter remembrance Frank dead--that she could farther use him--that she could future intercourse him--that even her prayers she could longer comfort naming him; last she turned his Bible he given her, seek consolation, her eyes refused office, pages became blistered tears. After Frank's funeral, Sir Edward became ill leave his bed; Major Graham remained constant conversation; Harry Laura every thing testify affection, fill place sadly vacant. On following Sunday, several congregation Hammersmith observed two young strangers rector's pew, dressed deepest mourning, pale downcast countenances, glided early church, sat immoveably still, side side, Mr. Palmer gave his text affecting appropriate words Frank often repeated his last illness, "In hour ye think not, Son man cometh." Not tear she would either Harry Laura,--their grief great utterance; yet listened breathless interest sermon, intended console them, also instruct young persons, afflicting event Frank's death. Mr. Palmer took opportunity describe amiable dispositions youth, show much pleasing may appear religion yet taken entire possession mind; he painted glowing colours beautiful consistency harmony character must ensue happy change, Holy Spirit renews heart influences life. It almost seemed Harry Laura Frank visibly eyes, Mr. Palmer spoke eloquent terms humility praise could diminish--that benevolence attended feelings, well wants others,--that affection ever ready make sacrifice he loved,--that docility obeyed call duty every occasion,--that meekness midst provocation could irritated,--that gentle firmness maintaining truths gospel, opposition could intimidate,--that cheerful submission suffering saw hand mercy darkest hour,--and faith ever "forgetting things behind, reaching forth unto things before,--pressing toward mark prize high calling God Christ Jesus." It seemed years passed heads Harry Laura short period absence home--that home Frank anxiously desired go! All changed within around them,--sorrow filled hearts, longer merry, thoughtless creatures, believing world one scene frolicsome enjoyment careless ease; witnessed realities,--they felt trials,--they experienced importance religion,--they learned frailty earthly joy,--and received, amidst tears sorrows, last injunction dying brother, "call upon Lord He near, seek Him he may yet found." "Uncle David," said Laura one day, several months return home, "Mrs. Crabtree first endeavoured lead us aright severity,--you grandmama tried kindness could do, nothing effectual till now, God Himself laid His hand upon us. Oh! heavy stroke necessary bring right mind, now, weep many bitter tears, Harry I often pray together good may come evil, 'we mourn deeply, may find best, comfort above'." Unthinking, idle, wild, young, I laugh'd, talk'd, danc'd, sung; And proud health, frolic vain, Dream'd sorrow, care, pain, Concluding hours glee, That world made me. But days trial came, When sorrow shook trembling frame, When folly's gay pursuits over, And I could dance sing more; It occurr'd sad 'twould Were world made me. Princess Amelia. THE END.
