 THE SETTLERS AT HOME. CHAPTER ONE. THE SETTLERS AT HOME. Two hundred years ago, Isle Axholme one remarkable places England. It island sea. It part Lincolnshire--a piece land hilly middle, surrounded rivers. The Trent runs east side it; smaller rivers formerly flowed round rest it, joining Humber north. These rivers carried great deal mud Humber, tides Humber washed great deal sea-sand mouths rivers; waters could time flow freely, last prevented flowing away all: sank ground, made swamp it--a swamp many miles round hilly part Isle Axholme. This swamp long dismal place. Fish, water-birds, rats inhabited it: stood hut fowler; peat-stack raised people lived hills round, obtained fuel peat-lands swamp. There also, sprinkled district, small houses--cells belonging Abbey Saint Mary, York. To cells monks Saint Mary's fond retiring, old times, meditation prayer, good district round; soil became swampy give ague often paid visit cells, monks left practice retiring hither; little dwellings stood empty, gradually overgrown green moss lank weeds, hand cleared away. At last Dutchman, seen wonders done his country good draining, thought he could render district fit inhabited cultivated; he made bargain king it. After spending much money, taking great pains, he succeeded. He drew waters new channels, kept sluices, carefully watching embankments he raised. The land left dry manured cultivated, till, instead reedy mossy swamp, fields clover corn, meadows finest grass, cattle sheep grazing large numbers. The dwellings still standing made farm-houses, new farmhouses built. A church here, chapel cleaned, warmed, painted, opened worship; good roads crossed district counties near. Instead pleased change, people country angry discontented. Those lived near long accustomed fishing fowling swamp, without paying rent, ask anybody's leave. They mind settle regular toilsome business farming,--and landlord, must pay rent. Probably, too, knew nothing farming, would failed tried. Thus far blamed. But nothing exceed malignity treated tenants settle isle, spiteful spirit showed towards them, every occasion. These tenants chiefly foreigners. There civil war England time: Yorkshire Lincolnshire people much engaged fighting King Charles Parliament, fewer persons liberty undertake new farms would time peace. When Dutchman his companions found English disposed occupy Levels (as drained lands called), encouraged countrymen come over. With arrived Frenchmen, driven France Holland, account Protestants. From first last, two hundred families, Dutch French, settled Levels. Some collected village, chapel opened, pastor performed service them. Others scattered district, living occupations required settle. All foreigners subject bad treatment neighbours; stragglers worst off; easiest tease injure lived alone. The disappointed fishers fowlers gave reasons conduct, besides nearly deprived fishing fowling. These reasons bad, reasons hating always are. One excuse new settlers foreigners--as far land need particular hospitality kindness. Another plea connected king, settled lands he bargained drained: sided parliament ought injure new tenants, order annoy king. If settlers tried serve king injuring his enemies, last reason might passed time war. But so. It probable foreigners understand quarrel. At rate, took part it. All desired left peace, cultivate lands paid rent for. But instead peace, little persecution. One settlers, Mr Linacre, farmer. He supplied farmers district manure particular kind, suited richest soils cultivated. He found, red soil isle, large mass white earth, called gypsum, which, wetted burnt, makes plaster Paris; which, ground, makes fine manure soils, careful Dutchmen well knew. Mr Linacre set windmill little eminence rose Level, high enough catch wind; he ground gypsum he dug neighbouring patch quarry. He build out-houses, dwelling-house; for, near his mill, space enough good garden between, one largest old cells monks Saint Mary's, well built stone, comfortably arranged, Mr Linacre little cleaned furnished, windows doors made new, fit residence his wife children, servant. This building round, three rooms below, three them. A staircase stone middle, winding round, like corkscrew,--leading upper rooms, upon roof, beautiful view,--quite far Humber north-east, circle hills every side. Each rooms door open air, another staircase;-- unlike modern houses, fit keep wind cold. But this, dwelling would warm, walls thick stone; fire-places large, seemed monks fond good fires. Two lower rooms opened garden; third, kitchen, yard;--so maid, Ailwin, far go milk cow feed poultry. Mrs Linacre neat management her house people Holland usually are; she like sitting-room, her husband his meals, spent his evenings, littered children, used her absence her daily occupation, summer. So she let use third room employments play. Her occupation, every summer's day, serving waters mineral spring, good deal frequented sick people, three miles her house, way Gainsborough. She set off, early breakfast, cool morning, generally arrived hill-side spring was, unlocked her little she would, taken her glasses, rinsed them, travellers passed. It rarely indeed sick person wait minute her appearance. There she sat, her she would rained, tree fine, sewing knitting diligently customers appeared, casting glance Levels spot her husband's mill rose midst green fields, she almost fancied sometimes she could see children sitting mill-steps, working garden. When customers appeared, she always ready moment serve them; her smile cheered sick, pleased came merely curiosity. She slipped halfpence she received pocket beneath her apron; sometimes pocket heavy one carry three miles home, she stepped aside village shop Haxey, farm-house people would going market next day, get her copper exchanged silver. Since times become troubled now, however, she avoided showing her money anywhere road. Her husband's advice she give attending spring altogether; she gained much money it, likely somebody would step her place soon she gave up, she would able regain her office quieter times come, she entreated allow her go she fears. She took heavy gold ear-rings her ears, wore plainer cap, left her large silver watch home; she looked like poor woman needy soldier bold thief would think robbing. She guessed sun right time locking her glasses going home; she commonly met her husband, coming fetch her, she got half-way. The three children sure perched top quarry bank, mill-steps, roof house, top winding staircase. Little George himself, though two years old, knew moment he shout clap his hands, make his mother wave her handkerchief turn road. Oliver Mildred exactly feel days long mother away, plenty do; felt best part day hour her return going bed: and, unlike people generally, liked winter better summer, season mother never left them, except go shop, market Haxey. Though Oliver eleven, Mildred nine, young great deal do. Oliver really useful gardener; many good dish vegetables his growing came table course year. Mildred take care child almost day; she often prepared cabbage, cut bacon Ailwin broil. She could also Ailwin could not,--she could sew little; apron handkerchief ready shown Mrs Linacre came home evening. If she met difficulty her job, maid could help her, her father sometimes could; curious see Mildred mounting mill she loss, her father wiping white plaster his hands, taking needle scissors his great fingers, rather his little girl able surprise her mother finished piece work. Then, Oliver Mildred learn catechism, say Pastor Dendel Sunday; always copy exercise hand, ready show he call; book finish he lent read, others his flock would ready done. Besides this, occupation boy girl thought others together. Among loads gypsum came mill, often pieces best kind,--lumps real, fine alabaster. Alabaster soft easily worked. Even finger-nail make mark upon it. Everybody knows beautiful vases little statues, well wrought alabaster, look mantelpiece, drawing-room table. Oliver seen France, common: his father carried one two ornaments kind Holland, he leave France. It great delight Oliver find, settling Axholme, he could much alabaster he pleased, he could work it. With little help Pastor Dendel his father, he soon learned so; his employments, he liked best. Pastor Dendel brought bowls cups pretty shapes different sizes, made common wood turner, one his flock; Oliver first copied clay, alabaster. By degrees he learned vary his patterns, last make his clay models fancies his own,--some turning failures, others prettier his wooden cups. These last he proceeded carve alabaster. Mildred could help watching he his favourite work, though difficult keep little George tossing alabaster about, stamping best pieces, sucking them. He would sometimes give his sister minutes' peace quiet rolling wooden bowls whole length room, running them: also hour, middle day, he went sleep his large Dutch cradle. At times Mildred would consult her brother his work; sew watch turns; read one pastor's little books, stopping occasionally wonder whether Oliver could attend his carving, she reading. When she saw he spoiling part, his hand shaking, she would ask whether he work long enough; would run garden quarry, jump George (if he awake again) second mill-step. One fine month August, breath wind blowing week two, mill-sails made single turn; load gypsum brought time, Oliver quite alabaster; though, happened, he much wanted good supply, particular reason. Every morning he brought his tools; every morning sky clear, corn-fields still--the trees silent, he wondered whether ever calm month August before. His father he employed time upon garden, good opportunity. Before put order, entire stock autumn cabbages set, came breezy day; children left finish cabbage patch themselves. While work, made merry hear mill-sails whirring air, see, intervals, trees quarry bowing heads, reeds waving swamp, water meadow-ponds dimpling rippling, wind swept Levels. Oliver soon heard something he liked better still--the creak truck brought gypsum quarry, crack driver's whip. He threw dibble he planting his cabbages-- tripped line he set direct his drilling, tumbled his face, scrambled again, ran, rubbing dirt his knees he went, look alabaster load. Mildred long him, though he called her she better stay finish cabbages, though little George, immediately feeling liberty, threw upon fresh mould cabbage bed, amused pulling up, flinging right left, plants set. How could Mildred attend this, she sure she wanted turn gypsum, see she could find? So Master George went his pranks, till Ailwin, accident, saw yard, ran snatched up, flung her shoulder, carried away screaming, till, pacify him, she set among poultry, he presently found amusing young cabbage plants. "Now shall set new cups spring, presently," said Oliver, he measured lump lump his little foot-rule. "Cups waters!" exclaimed his father. "So reason prodigious hurry, it, boy? You think tin cups good enough mother, her customers, waters. Which think ought ashamed tin cups?" "The water, all. Instead sparkling clear bright glass, looks nasty tastes thing brown rusty every time dipped. I give folk pair cups shall tempt drink--a pair cups white milk." "They long remain white: broke glasses bent upon spoiling cups, pains spend upon them." "I hope Redfurns happen hear them. We need blab; folk drink waters go way, soon done." "Whether Redfurns there, boy, want prying eyes see poor foreigners do. Your mother watched, belief, every time she dips her cup; I mill, garden. There hope keeping anything enemies." Seeing Oliver look uneasily, Mr Linacre reproached said anything alarm his timid boy: he added he always found comforting thought, he felt disturbed living among unkind neighbours. "Let watch us, Oliver. We nothing need ashamed of. The whole world welcome know live,--all do, year's end year's end." "Yes, would let us alone, father. But hard things broken spoiled!" "So is; know ill-natured talk going us. But must let take way, bear well can; help it." "I wish I justice!" cried Mildred. "How I would punish them, every one!" "Then I wish justice, dear; cannot get anybody punished is." "Mildred," said Oliver, "I wish would finish cabbages. You know must done; I busy." "Oh, Oliver! I little thing plant whole cabbage bed. You able come by; I want help you." "You cannot help me, dear: know cabbages well anybody. You really cannot help me." "Well, I want see then." "There nothing see yet. You done, make haste, I begin cut. Do, dear!" "Well, I will," replied Mildred, cheerfully. Her father caught her up, gave her one good jump whole flight steps, bidding her work away plants withered dead. She work away, till she hot tired she stop rest. There still two rows plant; she thought she never get them,--or rate, Oliver proceeded great way his carving. She going cry; she remembered would vex Oliver: she restrained herself, ran ask Ailwin whether she could come help. Ailwin always everybody asked her; she gave sorting feathers, left about, she went garden. Mildred knew she must take little George away, he would making confusion among feathers sorted. She invited go her, peep hedge geese marsh; little fellow took her fore-finger, trotted away his sister hedge. There plenty water-fowl marsh; something else Mildred seem like. While George quack-quacking, making like little goose he could, Mildred softly called Ailwin, beckoned her hedge. Ailwin came, swinging great spade her right hand, easily Mildred could flourish George's whip. "Look,--look there!--under bank, dyke!" said Mildred, softly she afraid heard yard's distance. "Eh! Look--if gipsies!" cried Ailwin, almost loud she talking across marsh. "Eh dear! We got gipsies upon us now; become poultry? Yon gipsy tent, sure; must tell master mistress, keep eye poultry. Sure, yon gipsy tent." Little George, thinking everybody much frightened, began roar; made Ailwin talk louder still, comfort him; nothing Mildred said heard. At last, she pulled Ailwin's apron, tall woman stooped down, ask she wanted. "I think gipsies," said she. "I afraid worse that. I afraid Redfurns. This way settle themselves--in sort tent--when come fowl, autumn." "If I catch Roger," said Ailwin, "I will--." And she clenched her hand, she meant terrible things, she caught Roger. "I go call father, shall I?" said Mildred, her teeth chattering, she stood hot sun. She turning go garden, laugh George made her look back again. She saw head covered otter-skin cap,--the face looking cross threatening, peeping hedge,--which high marsh, person must climbed bank purpose look garden. There mistaking face. It certainly Roger Redfurn--the plague settlers, who, his uncle, Stephen Redfurn, always mischief he could everybody had, he said, trespassed marshes. Nobody liked see Redfurns sitting neighbourhood; still less, skulking premises. Mildred flew towards mill; Ailwin, never stopped consider wise, might not, perhaps, hit upon wisdom she had, took stone, told Roger he better gone, he friends here. Roger seemed come orchard; he pulled hard apple his pocket, aimed Ailwin's head, struck her blow nose made her eyes water. While she wiping her eyes her apron, trying see again, Roger coaxed child bring his apple again, disappeared. When Mildred reached mill, she found Pastor Dendel there, talking her father sending manure his land. The pastor busy, he gave her nod; she therefore time recover herself, instead frightening everybody her looks her news once. Oliver could stay house pastor mill: he stood behind him, chipping away rough part his work. Mildred whispered Redfurns close hand. She saw Oliver turn red, though he told her frightened. Perhaps pastor perceived too, he turned round, he said-- "What matter, children? Mildred, doing, breath? Have running way Lincoln spire?" "No, sir; running--but--" "The Redfurns come, sir," cried Oliver. "Father, Redfurns come." "Roger peeping hedge garden," cried Mildred, sinking tears. The miller looked grave, said end peace, time come. "Are mercy boy like Roger Redfurn," asked pastor, "so look plague come fresh breeze?" "And his uncle, sir." "And his aunt," added Mildred. "You know Stephen Redfurn is, sir," observed Mr Linacre. "Roger beats even mischief. And mercy, sir. There magistrate, know, hear complaint one us country-people. We get nothing trouble, expense, ridicule, making complaints. We know beforehand; triumph always side." "It hard," said pastor: "but still,--here man, woman, boy. Cannot defend them?" "No, sir; honourable enemy," replied Mr Linacre. "If Stephen would fight even ground, would see would beat: I dare say boy there, though none roughest, would stand Roger. But fair trials suit them, sir. People creep drains, us mischief, hide reeds awake, come among us asleep, foe may easily ruin honest man, cannot get protection law. They houghed cow, two years ago, sir." "And mixed mother's feathers, whole year," exclaimed Mildred. "And blinded dog," cried Oliver;--"put eyes." "Oh! What next?" said Mildred, looking her tears pastor. "Worse things even done people village," replied pastor: "and borne, Mildred, without tears." Mildred made haste wipe her eyes. "And think, dears, life Protestant brethren leading now, parts world?" "Father came away France he ill-used Protestant," said Oliver. "The pastor knows that, boy," observed Mr Linacre. "Yes, I do," said pastor. "I know suffered worse things here; I know things worse either present endured brethren Piedmont. You warm house heads; live sunshine plenty. They driven villages, fire sword--forced shelter among snow-drifts, pent caves till rush starving, implore mercy scoffing persecutors. Could bear this, children?" "They suffer things religion," observed Oliver. "They feel martyrs." "Do think comfort thought,--in pride martyrdom,--to son sees his aged parents perish wayside,--to mother whose infant dashed rock her eyes?" "How _do_ bear all, then?" "They keep one another mind God's will, dears; obedient children can, try, bear God sees fit lay upon them. So praise His name strong heart, though voices weak. Morning night, mountains echo hymns; though death, one form another, sufferers every side. "My dear," said Mr Linacre, "let us make complaints Redfurns. I ashamed, I think brethren abroad, ever let Stephen Roger put us anger. You see tears here, sir, I hope." "Mildred quite promise that," said pastor, smiling kindly little girl. "Make promises, dear, little girl like may tempted break. Only try forgive people tease injure you; remember nothing ever happens God permits,--though He yet see fit let us know why." "I would ask this, sir," said Mr Linacre. "Is anything going forward particularly encourages enemies attack us?" "The parliament committee sitting Lincoln, present; king's seems low parts. We thus mercy choose consider us king's men: higher truer mercy always us." The miller took his hat token respect. The pastor's eye upon Oliver time. He asked whether he meant make his new cups plain, like rest, try ornament them. Mildred assured Oliver carved beading round two last bowls he cut. "I think might attempt something far prettier beading," said pastor; "particularly many patterns eyes work by." He looking little recess door house, near standing. This recess, formerly image, surrounded carved stone-work. "I see foliage would answer purpose, Oliver, could make model it. Let us look closer." And Pastor Dendel fixed short ladder house wall, went up, Oliver him. They busy selecting figures Oliver thought he could copy, drawing upon paper, setting modelling clay, Redfurns prevent happy day, least. Mr Linacre, too, hard work day, grinding, pastor's manure might served to-morrow; he found hard work good anxious mind tried generally find be. CHAPTER TWO. NEIGHBOURLY OFFICES. When Mrs Linacre told evening arrival disagreeable neighbours marsh, she sorry; she gone round premises her husband night, found safe, tokens intrusion, she disposed hope Redfurns would, time, keep fishing fowling, make disturbance. Oliver Mildred crept garden hedge sunrise, peeped it, see carr, marsh called. [In part country, carr means morass.] After watching time, saw Stephen Roger creep low brown tent. As almost level sun shone full faces, rubbed eyes; stretched yawned, seemed trying hard wake thoroughly. "They sound asleep, however," observed Oliver his sister; "and still early, I believe abroad mischief night. They would awake yet had." "Look! There woman!" exclaimed Mildred. "Is Nan?" "Yes; Nan Redfurn,--Stephen's wife. That great net she her arm. They going draw oval pond, I think. We watch sport nicely here. They cannot see inch us." "But like watch us," said Mildred, drawing back. "We like know peeping us behind hedge." "We mind afraid them," replied Oliver. "It plot mischief cannot bear prying. We going mischief, know; cannot mean make secret middle carr, high ground it." Satisfied this, Mildred crouched down, her arm her brother's neck, saw great net cast, pond almost emptied fish,--some kept food, small fry--especially stickleback--being thrown heaps, sold manure. "Will come way done drawing pond?" asked Mildred, fear, she saw moving about. "I think sweep shallow waters, left, stickleback," replied Oliver. "They make load, sell heat day, set anything else." Oliver right. All three repaired shallow water, stood among reeds, half hidden. The children could see, however, little George came garden, shouting come breakfast, strangers took heed child. They turned heads moment towards garden, spoke together laughed. "There, now!" cried Oliver, vexed: "that forgot go breakfast. So much watch! Mother need sent George make noise; but, I watch, he would come all; people would put mind us." "You soon able watch now, like boys Holland," said Mildred. "Your alabaster things change away watch; they? But might remembered breakfast, watch." "We forgetting now," said Oliver, catching George running house, followed Mildred, could help feeling Roger her heels. They surprised find late was. Their father already gone Pastor Dendel's load manure. Their mother waited kiss she went, tell father meant back soon he could; meantime, neighbour Gool promised keep eye mill. If anything happened frighten them, Oliver Ailwin set mill-sails agoing, neighbour Gool his men would presently. She think, however, anything would happen little time father would away. "I tell do!" cried Oliver, starting his chair, he eating his bread milk, silence, time his mother's departure. "Let us dress figure look like father, set mill-window; Redfurns shall find he away. Will not good?" "Put mill-steps. They may look window." "The mill-steps, then. Where father's old hat? Put broom there, see looks. Run mill, dear, bring his jacket--and his apron," he shouted his sister ran. Mildred brought both, dressed broom. "That never do," said Mildred. "Look sleeves hang; he holds his head! It bit like man." "It Is good scarecrow," declared Ailwin. "I seen many worse scarecrow that." "But scare Redfurns, far wiser crows," said Mildred. "Look George pulls apron, tugs broomstick behind! It scare even him." "It look different steps--in open air," Oliver declared. "A bunch two straw sleeves, jacket, make seem alive." And he carried out, tied upon mill-steps. It easy matter fasten make look like man naturally mounting stairs. The difficult was, however, became interested business. Mildred brought straw, Ailwin tied knot here, another knot there, Oliver cocked hat various directions upon head, till forgot dressing figure for. The reason popped Ailwin's head again, she succeeded raising right arm rail, life-like manner. "There!" said she, stepping backwards view her work, "that makes good master me. I obey everything he bids till master comes home." At moment, she walked backwards something, little George clung screaming Mildred's knees. Roger spread his arms Ailwin walk back into; Stephen behind, leaning cow-she would. They watching party doing, and, overheard every word, found reason. The children saw foolish been; thought confused much, know next. Poor Ailwin, could never learn wisdom, less, made matters worse she said did. Stout strong she was, she could nothing, Roger taken hint she given walking backwards, her arms crossed behind her: he pinioned her. She cried Oliver run up, set mill-sails agoing, bring neighbour Gool. Stephen took second hint. He quietly swung Oliver steps, sent his scarecrow him, took his seat threshold mill. There he sat, laughing see Ailwin wearied herself struggles, Roger, merely hanging her arms, prevented her getting free. When, however, Oliver flew boy, struck fierce blows, Stephen came down, drove little girl baby house, locked in, went help Roger his strong arm. It clear Mildred she ought do. Crying she was, she put George corner, playthings, keep fire till she came again, mounted stairs, quickly her trembling limbs would let her,--first her mother's room, upon roof. She tied large red handkerchief her mother's upon her father's Sunday walking-stick, waved it, high she could hold it, her head, she considered she could fasten it; would never leave George alone many minutes. Perhaps neighbour Gool seen already, would soon his men. But, lest he not, she must fix her flag, trust Stephen Roger thinking looking roof yard below. At last, many attempts, she thrust stick crevice roof, fixed heavy things round it,--having run three four times, see George safe. There was, indeed, time lost, intruders mischief could think of, short robbing burning premises. The great tall man, Stephen, strolling lower rooms, found Mrs Linacre's knitting, pulled needles, unravelled work. Roger spied heap bulbs corner high shelf. They Mr Linacre's rare valuable tulip-roots, brought Holland. Roger cut one open, see looked like, threw whole lot boiler, steaming fire, saying family dish dinner to-day. They got hold Oliver's tools, cup he work upon. Stephen raised his arm, dash cup ground, Oliver sprang forward, said-- "You shall it,--you shall cup;--you do not know beauty be, done. Only let finish it, shall exchange stickleback caught morning. The stickleback manure garden; I sure like cup, let finish it." "Manure garden, indeed!" cried Stephen, gruffly. "I will cut garden shreds first. What business garden carr? You great landlord find set outlandish plants growing geese ought grazing. We will show do not want foreigners here; do not like usage, may go home again; nobody cry back." "We pay garden mill," said Oliver. "We wrong nobody, work living, cruel man." "You pay king: parliament choose king money spend them. Mind that, boy! And--" "I sure I do not know anything king parliament, quarrels," said Oliver. "It hard punish us them, cruel." "You shall reason call cruel twenty times over, do not get away carr," said Stephen. "Manure garden, indeed! Not I! And shall manure another yard Levels. Come here, Roger." They went yard, Oliver, quite overcome, laid his head his arms, cried bitterly. "Here is cup, however," said Ailwin, released Roger's employed elsewhere. "This bit plaster thing laid hands ruined." Oliver started up, hid his work tools bundle straw, corner kitchen. "What Mildred say, I do not know," said Ailwin. "That boy wrung neck her white hen." Oliver desperate hearing this. He ran see whether he could not, means, get mill, set sails agoing: Stephen Roger, carrying water, threw gypsum ground,--floating away much could it, utterly spoiling rest, turning plaster. "Did ever see like?" cried Ailwin. "And nothing master particular keeping stuff dry. See woman, too! How I would like tug hair her head! She looks badly, poor creature, too." Stephen's wife had, indeed, come enjoy sport, she found man premises, danger. There she stood, leaning post mill, her black, untidy hair hanging her pale, hollow cheeks, her lean arms crossed upon her bosom. "There ague-struck folk seen every turn," said Ailwin, "before foreigners came live carr. I suppose brought healing them; one often see poor creature that. She might ashamed herself,--that woman; she laughs her poor sides can, every pailful Roger pours out.-- Eh! But she is laughing now! Eh! What is matter now?" The matter neighbour Gool sight, three four men. A cheer heard still way off. Oliver ran cheered, waving his hat his head. Ailwin cheered, waving towel window. Mildred cheered roof, waving her red flag; George stood doorway, shouting clapping his little hands. If object catch trespassers, cheering took place little soon. Stephen Roger off, like wild-ducks,--over garden hedge, sight. Neighbour Gool declared fairly among reeds marsh, would sheer waste time search them; could dodge live water, way honest people lived proper hard ground could follow. Here woman; yonder tent. Revenge might taken way, better ducking ponds man boy. Suppose took woman prison, made great fire carr, tent everything it! Oliver see could make lost, burn tent; he pretty sure his father would wish thing done. His father would soon home. As woman, he thought she ought go prison, Mr Gool would take her there. "That I will," said Gool. "I go thing I it. I came minute I saw red flag; I might sooner, I full watching mill-sails, I never looked till wife came help watch. Come, woman," said he Nan Redfurn, "make faces going prison, I give ride there." "She looks ill," thought Oliver,--"not fit jolted horse." "You will get magistrate send prison," said woman. "The justices parliament, every one. You bring back, sorry caught me, see comes it." "Cannot take care her till father comes home?" said Oliver, seeing neighbour Gool looked perplexed, he believed woman said. "No, no," said Mildred, whispering her brother. "Do not let woman stay here." "Neighbour Gool take care us till father comes home," said Oliver: "and woman looks ill! We lock her here: and, see, Ailwin ever much stronger she is, poor thing!" Neighbour Gool put air rather offended nothing great done, his trouble coming help. In his heart, however, he perhaps sorry; he knew magistrates willing countenance king's settlers Levels, Parliament Committee sitting Lincoln. Gool patted Oliver's head boy thanked coming; he joked Mildred her flag: he could cross. He left two men guard prisoner premises, till Mr Linacre return. These two men soon left marching garden yard, sat mill-steps; day grew hot. There sat talking shade, till dinners ready. Nan Redfurn far feeling day hot, her cold ague-fit came on, she begged allowed go kitchen fire. Little George stood staring her time, ran away; Mildred, liking room woman looked she did, prisoner, stole too, though she desired watch woman till dinner ready. Ailwin struck compassion, she fetched her warmest woollen stockings her winter cloak linsey-woolsey,--it piteous thing hear woman's teeth chattering her head, way, noon middle August. Having wrapped her up, she put her stool, close great kitchen fire; drew screen used winter, keep draughts door. If poor soul warm corner, nothing could make her so. Then Ailwin began sing cheer her heart, amazingly busy cooking dinner three additional persons. She never left her singing she went vegetables, things she wanted her cooking; she came she resumed her song,--still sake poor creature behind screen. "Do feel warmer now, neighbour?" said she end hour. "If not, past understanding." There answer; Ailwin wonder, she said herself, great trouble one poorly answering questions: Ailwin went slicing her vegetables singing. "Do think drop cherry-brandy would warm you, neighbour?" she asked, while. "I wonder I never thought before; only, sort thing one recollect till winter comes. Shall I get sup cherry-brandy?" Ailwin thought odd offer replied to, she looked hastily behind screen, see could reason. There reason enough. Nobody there. Nan Redfurn made her way soon she found herself alone, gone, Ailwin's best winter stockings linsey-woolsey cloak. In minute whole party looking hedge marsh. Nothing seen low brown tent, heap little fish. Neither man, woman, boy appeared names shouted forth. "Oh! My best stockings!" said Ailwin, half crying. "You saved cherry-brandy, woman, certain," observed one Gool's men. "I shall never pleasure it," sighed maid. "I shall never enjoy account reminding yon woman fooled me." "Then save pain," said man. "If oblige us to-day will not leave pain winter." "For shame," cried Oliver, "when know she lost her stockings her cloak already! And kindness! I would drink drop her cherry-brandy, I sure." "Then shall, Oliver, saying so, taking part," said Ailwin. "I going give anyone else ague; people may assured that." "If I thought cherry-brandy I came back," said man, throwing stone try nature bog-ground beneath, "I would get there, try I could find. I might lay hold linsey-woolsey cloak somewhere bog." "You never catch Redfurns, I doubt," said Ailwin. "What said you, Oliver, going off?" "They laughed able catch eels, asked I thought I catch _them_. They said I could decoy wild-fowl, I might set trap Redfurns. But follow true said it. I do not see might caught anyone us justice afterwards. That is worst part it, father says." "There is father!" cried Mildred, crack whip heard. All started off, see could carry bad news fastest. All arrived yard together, except Ailwin, turned back take George, he roared left behind. "We must want wise head two among us," said vexed miller. "If sharp times require, surely could mercy folk scorn like. We must give heed see done." "Rather late that, neighbour, stock grinding grinding week, gone plaster," said one Gool's men. "That I say," replied miller, contemplating waste; "but may better late all." Mrs Linacre affected her husband happened. When she came home, poor Mildred's fortitude given way, she crying body her dear white hen. This caused Ailwin's eyes fill thought her stockings cloak, family faces looked cheerless enough. "We deserve all," said Mrs Linacre, "for leaving place children care Gool's men, anybody ourselves. I go spring. I duty; may thankful punished." As she spoke tears started. Her tears rare, children looked dismay father. He gently declared injury suffered country-people needed earnings could make. They must cling means honest maintenance, throw away employment hers. He would leave children Redfurns neighbourhood. He would left to-day, serve anyone pastor; serve even him, he thought he bespoken sufficient protection. Nothing take home, his eye children, to-morrow, she might depend upon it. Mrs Linacre said she must go she take heavy heart her. This was, she feared, first fresh series attacks. If so, might look next? However, she asked found her duty. If her husband desired her go, she would go; she count hours day sadly enough. Oliver ventured bring old subject. He said he wanted earned money enough get watch. He sure he could hide Roger never guess he one; would comfort know exactly time going, look his mother home, instead guess, cloudy weather, hour day, argue matter Ailwin, always wrong particular thing. His father smiled mournfully, he observed, he hoped Oliver would never want bread leave longing anything made gold silver. CHAPTER THREE. ONE WAY OF MAKING WAR. Mrs Linacre went spring usual, next morning. If weather doubtful--if pretence supposing day might fine, she would remained home. But she looked vain round sky cloud: wide expanse fields meadows Levels, waving corn fresh green grass, seemed bask sunshine, felt luxury. It glowing August day;--just day would bring invalids Gainsborough drink waters;--just day would tempt traveller stop shady she would, he could see waters bubbling up, taste famous medicinal spring, would cure present evil heat, whatever effect might lasting ailment. It day Mrs Linacre must missed her post, would wrong give earnings she might expect sun-down. So she desired her children leave premises,--not even go father's sight hearing; left them, secure, least, would obey her wishes. They quite willing so. Mildred looked behind her, every minutes, she worked garden, see whether Roger there, every rustle birds made among trees Red-hill,--the eminence behind house,--she fancied one hidden there. Oliver let his tools his alabaster lie hidden, much he longed work them. Mildred lost her greatest treasure,--the white hen. He must take care his greatest treasure. Twice, course morning, he went in, thought safer place; twice he put back among straw, safest all. He let alone last, Mildred saying she afraid Roger might somehow discover he went often. They ran mill three four times tell father brown tent still bank carr, could see nobody; though wild-ducks geese made fluttering noise, then, seemed one lurking ponds. Often course morning, too, Mr Linacre look mill-window, nod top steps, might see he forget them. Meantime, white smoke curled kitchen chimney, Ailwin cooked dinner; little George's voice often heard within, fun together. The children hot, began say hungry, thought dinner-time near, suddenly felt strong rush wind west. Oliver lost his cap, running it, heard loud shout father, looked up. They never heard shout loud he did, bidding run Red-hill moment. He waved his arm his cap direction, he mad. Mildred scampered hill. She know why, meaning rolling, roaring thunder seemed convulse air: her head full Roger; she thought mischief his. One part Red-hill steep, ground soft. Her feet slipped moss first, she got moss, red earth crumbled; she went back every step, till she caught hold brambles, trunk tree; that, trembling panting, she reached last top eminence. When she looked round, she saw rushing, roaring river garden been, before. Rough waters dashing hill she stood,--against house,--and mill. She saw flood spreading, rapidly light sunrise, whole expanse Levels. She saw another flood bursting Humber, north-east, meeting swept by;-- she saw two floods swallowing field field, meadow meadow, splashing every house, surrounding all, roofs, stacks beside them, looked like many little islands. She saw things moment, heed till afterwards,--for, Oliver? Oliver safe, though rather wonder he so, considering his care his cap. Oliver orderly boy, accustomed take great care his things; occur let his cap go, he run his life. He part it, however. He flying it, another shout his father made look round; he saw wall water, he called it, rolling directly upon house. He gave prodigious spring across garden ditch, hill-side, escaped; wind immediately preceded flood blew down; clinging trunk tree saved him, his sister saved before. As was, his feet wet. Oliver panted trembled like his sister, he safe. Every one safe. Ailwin appeared upper window, exhibiting little George. Mr Linacre stood, folded arms, doorway his mill; his wife (he thankful remember) side high hill, far away. The children father knew, flood roaring them, thinking of; moment, miller his boy waved, one his hat, green bough, high joyously heads. Little George saw window, clapped his hands, jumped, Ailwin held window-sill. "Look Geordie!" cried Mildred. "Do look him! Do not think hear now?" This happy mood could last long, however, waters, instead going down, evidently rising every moment. From first, flood deep rapid allow miller crossing his mill his house. He poor swimmer; swimmer, he thought, could avoided carried away wide marsh, help. Then, instead stream slackening, rushed furiously rose,--rose first wall yard, fourth--fifth--sixth step mill-ladder, almost branches apple-trees garden. "I hope mind hungry, Mildred," said her brother, time silence. "We likely dinner to-day, I think." "I do not mind that, much," said Mildred, "but think get away, great river us home?" "We shall see father does," said Oliver. "He still, side." "But water? When go away?" "I afraid embankments burst. And yet weather fine enough lately. Perhaps sluices broken up." Seeing Mildred understand he said, he explained-- "You know, Levels watery grounds once; wet carr yonder. Well,--great clay banks made keep Humber waters, there, north-east, west north-west yonder, keep two three rivers overflowing land. Then several canals ditches cut, drain land; great gates put up, there, let waters out, wanted. I afraid gates gone, clay banks broken down, sea rivers pouring water have." "But over? Will ever run again? Shall ever get home again?" "I know anything it. We must wait, watch father do. See! What coming?" "A dead horse!" exclaimed Mildred. "Drowned, I suppose. Do not think so, Oliver?" "Drowned, course.--Do know, Mildred," he continued, silence, he looking towards sheds yard, his sister's eyes following body horse swept along, whirled round eddy, going clear hedge carr,--"do know, Mildred," said Oliver, "I think father completely ruined flood." "Do you?" said Mildred, quite know ruined. "How? Why?" "Why, bad enough much gypsum spoiled yesterday. I afraid whole quarry spoiled. And I doubt whether harvest ruined Levels: I pretty sure nothing growing garden waters gone. That horse went by; horse may drowned, cow, sow, everything." "Not fowls," said Mildred. "Look them, row top cow-she would. They drowned, rate." "But may starved. O dear!" he continued, start recollection, "I wonder whether Ailwin thought moving meal grain up-stairs. It rotted spoiled water runs it." He shouted, made signs Ailwin, his might; vain. She could hear word he said, make anything his signs. He vexed, said Ailwin always stupid. "So she is," replied Mildred; "but signify now. Look water pouring parlour-window. The meal grain must wet long ago. Is pretty waterfall? A waterfall parlour-window, upon tulip-bed! How odd!" "If one could think feed poor animals," said Oliver,--"and fowls! If anything one could get them! One might cut little grass cow;--but nothing else." "Only leaves trees, blackberries, ripe," said Mildred, looking round her, "and flowers,--wild-flowers, mother planted." "The bees!" cried Oliver. "Let us save them. They feed themselves. We save bees." "Why, do not think drowned?" said Mildred. The bees drowned; danger Mildred supposed. Their little she would placed side Red-hill, overlook flowery garden. The waters stood among posts she would; hives shook every wave rolled along. "You cannot it, Oliver," cried Mildred, her brother crept slope back she would. "You never get round, Oliver. You slip in, Oliver!" Oliver looked round nodded, use speaking noise. He presently showed he mean go round front she would. That would never done; flood washed away soil there, left nothing stand upon. He broke away boards back bee-she would, old loosely fastened. He glad he come; bees bustling great confusion distress, evidently aware something great matter. Oliver seized one hives, board stood on, carried it, steadily he could, sunny part hill, he put grass. He went another, asking Mildred come part way receive second hive, put first, he saw moment lose. She so; she trembled much, probable she would let hive fall, ever her hands. It never was, however. The soil melting away water, Oliver stood firmly minutes before. He take great care, change his footing every instant; without slipping sliding, wet feet, he brought away second hive. Mildred saw hot he was, he sat resting, hive, climbing bank, begged he would try more. "These poor bees!" exclaimed Oliver, beginning move again, thought bees drowned. But he done he could. The water boiled she would bank, lifted whole structure, swept away. Oliver hastened put second hive beside first; he returned, saw posts sunk, boards floating away, remaining hive sailing stream. "How rocks!" cried Mildred. "I wish would turn quite over, poor things might get out, fly away." "They never will," said Oliver. "I wish I thought bees little sooner. It odd not, Mildred." "I do not know think anything," said Mildred, dolefully; "it odd frightful!" "Well, do not cry, help it, dear," said her brother. "We shall see father do. He will not cry;--I sure that." Mildred laughed: she never seen her father cry. "He far crying yesterday, though," said Oliver, "when he saw poor hen lying dead. He looked--but, O Mildred! What become Redfurns? We have, thinking bees; never remembered Redfurns. Why, tent scarcely bigger hives; I sure could stand minute flood." While he spoke, Oliver running part hill commanded widest view carr, Mildred following his heels,--a good deal startled hares leaped across her path. There seemed hares hill she seen her life before. She could ask hares, however, she saw brown tent, piece it, flapping water, great way off, sweeping along current. "Hark! What that? Did hear?" said Oliver, turning pale. "I thought I heard child crying great way off," said Mildred, trembling. "It child, dear. It shriek,--a woman's shriek, I afraid. I afraid Nan Redfurn, somewhere carr. O dear, drowned, nobody help them!" "No, no,--I do not believe it," said Mildred. "They got somewhere,--climbed something,--that bank something." They heard nothing more, amidst dash flood, fancied could see figures moving ridge bank, far carr. When tired straining eyes, looked them, saw, smoother piece water near hill, dog swimming, seeming labour much. "It got something fastened it," cried Mildred;--"something tied round neck." "It somebody swimming," replied Oliver. "They get safe now. Cannot help them? I wish I rope! A long switch may do. I get long switch." "Yes, cut long switch," cried Mildred: she pulled tugged long tough thorny bramble, minding pricking her fingers tearing her frock. She could help starting immense number large birds flew out, rabbits ran away her feet, she it; she never left hold, dragged long bramble part hill dog seemed trying reach. Oliver already there, holding slip ash, he sometimes cut fishing-rod. "It Roger, I believe; I see nothing others," said he. "Look his head, bobs down. Is Roger?" "O dear! I hope not!" cried Mildred, tone despair. "What shall he comes?" "We must see afterwards: must save first. Now it!" As Oliver spoke, dog ducked, came without Roger, swimming lightly bank, leaping ashore bark. Roger there, however,--very near, supposed, exhausted, he seemed fall back, sink, catching hold Oliver's switch, jerk twitched boy's hand. "Try again!" shouted Oliver, he laid Mildred's bramble along water. "Do not let go, Mildred." Mildred let thorns run deep her fingers without leaving her hold. Roger grasped end: pulled, without jerking, strength, till he reached bank, could help hands. "Oh, I glad safe, Roger!" said Oliver. "You might found something better thorny switch throw me," said Roger. "My hands blood spikes." "Look hers!" cried Oliver, intending show state his sister's hands in, Roger's sake; Mildred pulled away her hands, hid behind her she retreated, saying,-- "No, no. Never mind now." Oliver saw drenched poor boy looked, forgave whatever he might say. He asked Mildred go back place standing, opposite house; he would come her presently. He begged Roger slip his coat trousers, might wring wet them. He thought would soon dry sun. But Roger pushed away his shoulder, said he knew he wanted;--he wanted see he got him. He would knock anybody touched his pockets. It plain Roger choose helped way; Oliver soon ran off, joined Mildred, he promised. "I like leave him, wet, tired I could knock little finger," exclaimed Oliver. "But he will not trust thing." "There father again! Tell him," cried Mildred. Both children shouted Roger here, pointed behind them; plain father could make word said, though never called loud lives. Roger heard them, however, judged seeing skulking among trees behind, watching use making his name. The children thought father growing anxious. He still waved his hat them, then, he looked way; saw gazing abroad, surprised rush waters abate. They observed glance often round sky, signs wind; longed know whether he thought wind would good harm. They saw bring out, third time, rope he seemed think short use; appeared case, first. Then he stooped down, make mark side white door-post (for water time quite hidden steps); Oliver thought make out, certain, whether flood regularly rising not. They could imagine he examined closely saw door lintel, window-frame. It occur them, him, mill might break force current. At last clear he saw Roger; moment, he scarcely took his eyes his children. Oliver put his arm round Mildred's neck, said her ear,-- "I know father watching us for. He afraid Stephen too, one take care us;--not even Ailwin." "Perhaps Stephen here,--in wood," cried Mildred, terror. "I wish water would make haste run away, let us get home." "It cannot run faster does. Look waves dash along! That worst it:--it shows quantity is, came from. But I do not believe Stephen here. I good mind ask Roger, make tell me." "No, do not, Oliver! Stephen may drowned. Do put mind." "Why, see he care anything. He teasing live thing minute,--there, ground." Oliver forgot everything live animals his eyes, he saw many trees. The grass swarming mice, moles, small snakes; rabbits cocked little white tails, directions, partridges flew every bush, hares started every hollow boy looked into. "All soaked holes;--do not know themselves;-- fine sport mind it," said Roger, he lay ground, pulling back little mouse long tail, often tried run away. "You mind sport to-day, I suppose, Roger. I think anybody has." "I do not know;--I am rarely hungry," said boy. "So we; forgot again. Father mill there..." "You need tell that. Do not I see him?" "But think he looking Stephen." "He will not find him," said Roger, low voice; low Oliver sure he said. "He hill, then, Roger?" "On hill,--no! I do not know he is, woman either. I suppose drowned, I was, nearly. If swim I did, must drowned: could hardly that, I dog." The children looked other; looks told thought Roger shocked sorry, though he tried appear so. "There might boat, perhaps, carr. Do not think country-people hills would get boats saw flood spreading?" "Boats, no! The hill-people three boats among all. There three near ponds; like nut-shells. How boat live flood that? Why, flood would sweep ship sea minute. You need think boats, I tell you." "But will not anybody send boat us?" inquired Mildred, drawn near listen. "If do not send boat, flood goes on, do? We cannot live here, nothing eat, beds, shelter, rain." "Are beginning cry that? Are beginning find out, time?" said Roger, contemptuously. "I thought get away," sobbed little girl. "I thought boat something would come." "A pretty silly thing must be!" exclaimed Roger. "If she silly, I silly too," declared Oliver. "I sure silly look boat. There plenty coast there." "They dashed pieces long ago," decided Roger. "And let flood take good care do not get it,--you, outlanders. It along I scrape. But shameful give us notice;--it bad catch us trap you. If uncle drowned, I ever get alive, I revenged them." Mildred stopped crying, well she could, listen; she felt like Oliver he said,-- "I do not know word mean." "I dare say not. You foreigners never know anything like people." "But will not tell us? Who made flood?" "To sure, were not meant know this. It would done show way trap. Why--the Parliament Committee Lincoln ordered Snow-sewer sluice pulled to-day, drown king's lands, get rid his tenants. It good battle gained them." The children aghast wickedness deed. They would believe it. It would tyrannical cruel obliged settlers, interested quarrel king England his people, enlist, shot war. They would complained tyrannical cruel. But living peace quiet farms, paying rents, inclined show good-will everybody, pull flood-gates, let sea rivers drown lived king's lands, cruelty dreadful believed. Oliver Mildred believe it. They sure father would believe it; mother, ever she return her home family, would bring different account--that whole misfortune would turn accidental. So felt assured: fact Roger said. The Snow-sewer sluice pulled up, orders Committee Parliament, sitting Lincoln: done destroy king's new lands, deprive support his tenants. The jealous country-people round hoped also would prevent foreigners coming live England, however much might want refuge. Some sufferers knew misfortune happened. Others might thankful not; thought malice enemies must bitter fear ruin death. CHAPTER FOUR. A HUNGRY DAY. "We shall see father does," still consolation Oliver kept his sister's fears. He confidence his father's knowing best done occasions, he felt watch him, imitate whatever he might attempt. They remained quiet island now, hungry tired were, he remained mill, seemed expect water subside. The fearful thought dark, get home that. They supposed, last, father thinking too; he began move about, sun near setting, he done afternoon. They saw go carefully stream, proceed cautiously way--till water his chin. Then he buffeted terribly Mildred could bear look. Both Oliver Roger sure, he ventured, way he pulled back last steps, he tied rope seen measure. It certainly short good purpose; he go back, wetted skin. They saw yellow light west shone upon water. In minutes could distinguish longer, though mill stood black sky, midst gleaming flood. "Father wet, cold night!" said Mildred, crying. "If I could swim," exclaimed Oliver, "I would get somehow, carry rope house. I sure must rope long enough somewhere yard. If I could swim, I would get him." "That would not," said Roger. "Your father swim; he? Because nobody could swim across stream. It torrent. It would carry stout man carr; would better twig middle it." "I afraid torrent slacken," said Oliver, thoughtfully. "I afraid hollow near keep current." "What mean that?" "They say Holland, floods sometimes, water flows hollow, gets current, keeps way. Oh! The quarry!" he cried, sudden recollection. "Mildred, let us go, look side dark." They ran round hill; saw indeed flood tumbling quarry, like water boiling pot. When rushed out, carried white earth it, made long streak flood, explained stream house mill whiter muddy hill house. At occurred Roger stream hill house probably less rapid other; he said so. Oliver ran back; Mildred, pleased bare idea getting house. Once arrived opposite house, saw strange sight. The mill longer stood right place. It moved good way towards carr. Not that, still moving. It sailing away like ship. After first exclamation, even Roger stood still death watch it. He neither moved spoke till mill sight dusk. When Mildred burst loud cry, Oliver threw down, hiding his face ground, Roger spoke again. "Be quiet--you must," he said, decidedly, little girl. "We must bestir now, instead stopping see folks do." "Oh, father! Father drowned!" cried they. "You do not know that. If he drifts Humber, likely, way he going, ship may pick up--or he may light upon high ground. We cannot settle now, however; clear thing he would not wish us starve, whether he drowns not. Come, get up, lad!" said he, stirring Oliver his foot. "Do not lie there, Oliver; get up!" begged Mildred. Oliver rose, Roger bade him. "You say long rope somewhere house," said Roger. "Where it?" "There one cow-she would, I know." "And I cannot get there, one house?" "In lumber-room," said Mildred. "The spare bed tied round round long rope--I do not know long." "I wish set hour ago," muttered Roger, "instead waiting dark. A pretty set fools lose daylight! I say, lad, think anyway making fire? Here sticks enough, one could set alight." "To cook supper?" asked Mildred. "No; I mean sup within doors; must work first." Oliver steel knife; dark look flint, plan fire would do. "Well, do not plague fire," said Roger, "but listen me. Can climb tree? I will bound cannot: you will die cannot." "I can," said Oliver; "but Mildred do?" "We will see afterwards. Which trees stands nearest nearest yon upper windows?" Oliver Mildred pointed young ash, quite bent water. "That strong enough," said Roger, shaking tree, finding loosened roots. "Show stouter one." A well-grown beech next nearest. Roger pulled Oliver arm, made stand directly tree, his sister beside him. He desired move were, give loud halloo together, shriek (or anything might heard furthest)--about minute hour come, unless hear rope fall tree, anywhere near them. They watch rope, use endeavours catch it. There would weight end, would make easier catch. Oliver must tie rope trunk tree, stretching tight, his strength, tying securely weight would unfasten it. "Mind that," said Roger. "If do not, drowned, that is all. Do I tell you, you will see see." Roger whistled his dog, snatched Oliver's black ribbon his neck, fastened round dog's neck, hold by. He showed dog house, forced water, following, till children could longer see became them. "What think he means?" asked poor Mildred, shivering. "I do not know exactly. He cannot mean climb rope. I think I could that; I sure could not." "Oh, no, no! Let us stay here! Stay trees, here, Oliver." "Why, would much comfortable home fire. You shivering now, already, winter: night long, nothing eat." "But Roger gone; I do not like he is,--he rude boy! How he snatched ribbon, pulled about! And he calls `lad,' he might well say `Oliver.'" "We must mind things now, dear. And must get home, he show us how. Think glad Ailwin George be: I sure father would wish it, mother too. You must cry now, Mildred; indeed must not. People must time this. Come, help shout. Shriek loud long ever can." "I wish I might say prayers," said Mildred, presently. "Do, dear. Kneel here;--nobody sees us. Let us ask God save father,--and us too, George Ailwin, pleases Him;--and Roger." They kneeled down, Oliver said aloud God his heart. It great comfort both; knew human eye saw starlight, tree, God heard words, understood hearts. "Now again!" said Oliver, stood up. They raised cry minute, nearly could guess: given many thirty shouts, began find hard work, anything happened show use. Then something struck tree heads, pattered among leaves, touching Oliver's head last. He felt about, caught end rope, without climb tree, search it. They set shout different kind now; really glad. This shout answered gentle tug rope: Oliver held fast, determined let anything pull precious line his hand. "What here?" said he, he felt parcel tied rope, little way end. He gave Mildred untie open; she trouble, wishing evening dark. It tinder-box. "There now!" said Oliver, "we shall soon know about. Do know tree cut down, day?" "Close by? Yes." "Well; bring lapful chips,--quick; dry sticks find. We get twice fast light; see house manage." In minutes, fire blazing near tree. The rope must come straight house, without dipping water; flint steel safe, tinder within, cloth box done in, quite dry. "Roger clever fellow,--that certain," said Oliver. "Now fastening rope. Do take care fire keeps up. Do not spare chips. Keep good fire till I done." Oliver gave his strength pulling rope tight, winding round trunk beech, large knob stem. It seemed rope stretched pretty evenly, far he could see,--not slanting either down; sill upper window must upon level great knob beech-trunk. Oliver tied knot upon knot, till rope left knot. It still hung slack, meant bridge. He think he could ever cross water rope would keep dangling every move: he pulled tight his force, he could more. When he tied last knot, he Mildred stood front fire, raised one great shout, waving arms--sure seen well heard. "Look! Look!" cried Oliver, "it moving;--the rope slack! They tightening it. How much tighter I could pull it! That must Ailwin's strong arm,--together Roger's." "But still I never creep across way," declared Mildred. "I wish would try. Oliver. Do stay me!" "I leave you, dear: know mean us yet. There! Now rope shaking! We shall see something. Do see anything coming? Do not look flashing water. Fix eye rope, light upon it. What see?" "I see something like basket,--like one clothes' baskets,-- coming along line." It one Mrs Linacre's clothes' baskets, slung upon rope; Roger it. He stay minute. He threw Oliver line fastened end basket, he might pull over, window tree, emptied Roger. He put Mildred basket, carefully keeping hold line, order pull back his sister safely landed. Ailwin held line fastened end basket, pull way. Oliver overjoyed. He said he never seen anything clever; he asked Mildred whether she could possibly afraid riding safe little carriage. He told her help her passage pulling herself along bridge-rope, he called it, instead hindering her progress clinging rope she sat basket. Taking care let go line moment, he examined knots longer rope, found fast. In minutes he began hauling his line, empty basket came easily. "How shall I get in?" asked Mildred, trembling. "Here," said Oliver, stooping his back her. "Climb upon back. Now hold tree, stand upon shoulders. Do not afraid. You light enough. Now, cannot step in?" Feeling much depended upon this, little girl managed it. She tumbled basket, took lesson Oliver help her passage, earnestly begged take care his line, nothing might prevent his following her immediately. Then came great tug, she felt herself drawn back darkness. She like all. The water roared louder ever she hung it; light cast upon fire showed rapidly shooting beneath. Then she saw Oliver go, throw chips twigs fire; she knew he could see her longer. She worked hard she could, putting her hands one behind along rope: her hands weak, her head dizzy. She nothing eat since breakfast, quite tired out. While still keeping her eyes upon Oliver, she felt jerk. The basket knocked something; made her quite sick. She immediately heard Ailwin's voice saying, "it is one them, that is certain. Well! If I did not think vile conjuring trick, moment!" The poor dizzy child felt strong arm passed round her waist, found herself carried near fire room. She faltered out, "Ailwin, get something Oliver eat. He presently." "That I will: first. You shall drop cherry-brandy too." Mildred said she rather draught milk; Ailwin said milk. She able reach cow, milk her. What poor little George done, then?--He left morning. Ailwin added she sorry,--she could tell she came forgetful; she never thought able milk cow afternoon, drunk George left milk; her regular dinner drowned kitchen. Neither she remembered bring anything eatable up-stairs her flood drove her lower rooms. The flour grain water. The vegetables were, doubt, swimming cellar; meat would flour was, moment, Roger, said he mind starved, somehow fished joint mutton. This stewing fire; little likely good; besides vegetables, salt melted, water none best. Indeed, water bad could drunk alone: good Ailwin pressed drop her cherry-brandy. Mildred, however, preferred cup broth, which, poor was, better loaf--the loaf bread--being boiled it. Just Mildred thought she could stand window, watch Oliver, Oliver came window. He tired his wits him, Ailwin said;--wits, she added, worth hers. He brought dry wood him,--as much basket would hold; thinking peat-stack probably afloat, wood-heap wetted through. All pleased prospect keeping fire strange night. All agreed bridge-rope must left was, flood lasted. There wild animals birds enough Red-hill last food long while; alone could get fuel. "You cannot catch game without dog," cried Roger, surlily, Ailwin; "and dog shall not put his nose ground, do not feed well: he shall I am,--mind that." As he spoke, he opened door admit dog, Ailwin put upon stairs, sake her pet hen chicks room. The hen fluttered beam ceiling, appearance dog, chicks cluttered about, till Ailwin Mildred caught them, kept laps. They glanced timidly Roger, remembering fate white hen, day before. Roger heed them. He taken his knife, forked mutton kettle, cut best half his dog. Probably Oliver thinking Roger deserved best could give him, his late services; he said,-- "I sure, Roger, Mildred I shall never forget,--nor father mother either, ever know, it,--what done us to-night. We might died Red-hill you." "Stuff!" muttered Roger, he sat, swinging his legs, his open knife his hand, his mouth crammed,--"Stuff! As I cared whether she sink swim! I like sport that is all." Nobody spoke. Ailwin helped children poor broth, remains meat, shaking her head begged her take some. She whispered good deal Oliver cherry-brandy; he replied aloud looked smelled good; time he tasted it, made rather giddy; he wish giddy to-night;--there much think about; he sure flood got height. He said more, though his mind full his father. Neither he Mildred could mention father Ailwin to-night, even Roger way. Roger probably thought Oliver say silly; he sat laughing he heard it, time after. Half hour later, Ailwin passed near him, she laying bed Oliver, might together night alarm, she thought strong smell brandy. She flew her bottle, found empty,--not drop left. Roger drained all. His head soon dropped upon his breast, he fell his chair drunken sleep. Mildred shrank back horror; Ailwin Oliver rolled corner room, his dog lay beside him. Ailwin could refrain giving kick, he lay thus powerless, sneering his face he could see her. "Do not, Ailwin,--do not!" said Oliver. "Mildred I him." "And I terrified wits, two hours past, lost cherry-brandy, him. Mercy! I shall never forget his popping his face window, sending his dog him. I sure death flood making, come me, carried master, I thought, two." "Why, Ailwin, nonsense!" cried Mildred her bed,--trembling she spoke. "How could boy make flood?" "And see he done, instead carrying us off," observed Oliver. "Well, almost worth cherry-brandy see lie so,--dead drunk,--only would better still see really dead.--Well, may wicked thing say; wicked things he done;--and I mortally afraid him!" "I wish would say prayers, Ailwin, instead saying things: then, perhaps, would find afraid anybody." "Well, almost good pastor preached it. I hang chicks hand-basket, fear dog; say prayers, go sleep, please God. I sure want it." Oliver chose examine first high water stood lower rooms. He lighted piece wood, found two steps lower flight stairs remained dry. Ailwin protested earnestly waters risen two three hours, he thought might lie sleep. Ailwin he ones could keep watch. He think Ailwin's watching would worth much; he tired he think he could keep awake; he felt he much fit business lay next day, he could get good rest now. So he kissed little George, he lay beside him, soon sound asleep his companions. CHAPTER FIVE. SUNRISE OVER THE LEVELS. All party slept hours, quietly unconsciously little George himself. If children weary dreadful uncertainty father's fate could keep awake, probable knowledge danger might failed disturb them. But little idea George extent peril in. They know Levels surrounded hills every side towards sea; or, knew, consider this, hills great way off. But, whether far near, circle hills waters rising great height Levels, defences kept sea rivers broken down. As hills prevented overflowing waters running three sides, clear waters must rise level sea rivers flowed in. They reached height children lay rest, though Ailwin sure worst over; danger increased slept; slept soundly even dream accidents. The first disturbance child. Oliver became aware, his sleep, little George moving laughing. Oliver murmured, "Be quiet, George. Lie still, dear," child quiet minute. Presently, however, he moved again, something like dabbling water heard, while, moment, Oliver found his feet cold. He roused start, felt his bed wet, turning out, ankles water. By light embers, he saw floor pond, shoes floating it. His call woke Ailwin Mildred once. Roger stir, though good deal bustle noise. Mildred's bed high floor still quite dry. Oliver told her stay till he settle done next: he took child put Mildred, asking her strip his drenched clothes, keep warm. All apparel taken luckily top chest, far water. Oliver handed his sister, bidding her dress herself, well child. He carefully put fire together, make much light possible, told Ailwin must bestir themselves, fire would presently drowned out. Ailwin quite ready bestir herself; she idea beyond mounting chests, chairs, drawers; unless, indeed, she thought beam crossed ceiling, she seen cast her eyes, envying chicks hung there, hen still slept, her head beneath her wing, present reach flood. Oliver disapproved plan mounting furniture room. It might well, he said, nothing better done. But, time water would reach top chests, would impossible get door. He thought would wisest reach roof house could, carry comforts could collect, might removed dry condition. Ailwin agreed, going throw open door, Oliver stopped her hand. "Why, Oliver," she cried, "you will not let one anything; say, time, minute lost." Oliver showed her water streaming sides door, good way higher stood floor. He said door defence present,--that water higher stairs room, would great rush soon door opened. He wished, therefore, bedding, clothes drawers, else could remove top house, bundled up, placed highest chest drawers, water let in. They must borrow line clothes' basket, tie round George's waist, might lose confusion. One thing must done: must rouse Roger, he might drowned. Ailwin anxious last piece duty omitted:--not she exactly wished Roger drowned,--at least, her means; she, ignorant she was,--had superstitious feeling Roger his family caused flood, he could save well enough, though he appeared sunk drunken sleep. She indulged Oliver, however, far help seize lad, neck heels, lay him, dripping he was, upon table. Before bedding clothes tied up, door room shook threaten burst in, latch giving way. It struck everybody person open would run risk suffocated, terribly knocked about; yet, hardly wise wait bursting. Oliver, therefore, tied string knob bolt, slipped bolt, keep door fastened he lifted tied latch. The door shook more; so, set window wide open, he made haste scramble Mildred was, wound cord George's waist round his arm, bade Mildred hold child fast, gave notice he going open door. It strange party, boy could help noting moment,--the maid standing bed, hugging bed-post, staring frightened eyes; Roger snoring table, sleeping hen beam; three children perched top high chest drawers. George took play,-- new sash he bolting door, climbing scrambling. He laughed kicked, his sister could scarcely hold him. "Now it!" cried Oliver. "Oh, Oliver, stop minute!" cried Ailwin. "Do not hurry drown us all, Oliver. Stop moment, Oliver." Oliver knew, however, way drown stop. At first pull bolt gave way, door burst open, would break hinges, great body water dashed in. The first thing wave wash Roger table; next, put fire fizz,--so light dawn, advancing. The waters next dashed wall opposite door; rebound, less force, drawers children sat. It leaped window, leaving troubled surface half height room. Above noise, Ailwin heard lamenting, chicks cluttering, hen fluttering, George laughing clapping his hands. "You George safe?" said Oliver. "Very well! I believe get out. There Roger's head water; I do not think neck; though everybody laughs short boy." He stepped upon chair, cautiously water. It nearly his chin. "That do," said he, cheerfully. "Now, Ailwin, tallest;--please carry George roof house, stay till I come." Ailwin made many lamentations step water; she took good care child, carrying quite high dry. Oliver followed, see he tied securely balustrade roof. While he this, Ailwin brought Mildred way. Mildred wanted use below; her brother told her best thing she could watch amuse George, stand ready receive things saved chambers,--she tall enough service four feet water. It strange forlorn feeling Mildred,--the left house-top cold grey morning, hour she always hitherto asleep bed. The world itself, she looked round her, seemed unlike one she hitherto lived in. The stars sky; dim,--fading light morning. There fields, gardens, roads seen;--only grey water, far away every side. She could see nothing beyond grey water, except towards east, line low hills stood her brightening sky. Poor Mildred felt dizzy, much moving water her eyes, her ears sound current below. The house shook trembled, too, force flood: she glad fix her sight steady line distant hills. She spoke George occasionally, keep quiet; she ready receive every article handed stairs below: but, intervals, she fixed her eyes distant hills. She thought easy would reach ridge, she bird; hard would pine away house-top, sink death waters, want wings inferior creatures had. Then she thought superior creatures wings too: she longed angel. She longed trouble fear; considered would worth drowned, free bird angel. She resolved remember this, frightened, water rise rise, till sweep her quite away. She thought might befallen her mother yesterday. No boat seen waters direction Gainsborough; sign reached family one thinking distance, trying save them: Oliver Mildred agreed likely Mrs Linacre heard report pulling sluices, might her way home flood overtook drowned her. If so, she might angel. If angel, Mildred sure her first thought would be, ever been, her home her children; little girl looked see whether anything like shadow wings her dim stars. She saw nothing; still, kind hope, she softly breathed words, "O, mother! Mother!" "Mother! Mother!" shouted little George, he overheard her. Oliver leaped stairs, inquired whether boat,--whether mother coming. "No, Oliver, no. I thinking mother; so, I suppose, George. I afraid disappointed;--I sorry." Oliver bit his lip prevent crying, could speak directly; seemed gazing carefully around waste. He said, last, he many times thought his mother might come boat: he thought she might still, unless... "Unless she angel now," whispered Mildred,--"unless she died yesterday; she might us now, moment, though cannot see her;--might she?" "Yes, I believe so, dear. And, one thing, I almost wish she may come boat. Who tell her father carried away waters, without spoken one word us?" "If dead, think together now?" asked Mildred. "Certainly. Pastor Dendel says love one another well enough live together, never die more." "And I sure did," said Mildred. "If see us now," said Oliver, "it must make great difference whether frightened miserable, whether behave ought do. Let us try frightened, sakes, dear." "And us while, God is," whispered Mildred. "O, yes; God knows ... God expect..." "Surely He feel way us," said Mildred, remembering repeating verse Pastor Dendel taught her. "`Like father pitieth his children, Lord pitieth fear him.'" "`For he knoweth frame; he remembereth dust.'" So Oliver continued psalm. "There comes sun!" exclaimed Mildred, happy greet one familiar object amidst strange scene. The scene hardly appeared sun, first peeping hills like golden star, flamed full size, cast broad glittering light wide waters, eyes children. They felt warmth too, immediately; cheering. The eastern hills almost disappeared sun's blaze; west shone clearly; southern ridge near Gainsborough, looked really little way off. The children knew, however, three full miles land, except Red-hill, hillocks peeped flood Levels: sign boat, far near. Oliver checked sigh, he convinced this; began look become people knew Levels. Neighbour Gool's dwelling stood low; nothing seen dark speck, might top chimney. It possible whole family might escaped; Gool his wife Haxey yesterday; might hear mischief intended done sluices, time save rest household. Some roofs hamlet Sandtoft stood waters; whole upper part chapel used foreigners; many might easily found refuge there. Further off, conspicuous object elegant crocketed spire one beautiful Lincolnshire churches, standing high, inviting dismayed come save air dangers waters. Oliver wondered whether sufferers watching sunrise long ridge church-roof, windows spire. One curious sights fleets haystacks sailing along courses currents. As smaller stacks sometimes shot forward rapidly, whirled round eddy, large stately stack followed forwards, performing turns voyage, Mildred compared duck her ducklings pond, Oliver great ship voyaging fleet small craft. They saw sights far sorrowful this. They grieved fine large trees--some full leaf--that saw tumbling torrents cut stiller waters; yet worse see dead cows, horses, pigs, sheep carried past--some directly garden, spot mill stood. There also thatched roofs carried away entire; many chest, chair, cow-rack--showing destruction gone night. While distant scene bright lovely sunrise, nearer objects, thickly strewn muddy waters, ugly dismal; Oliver saw his sister good watch them. He started, said must idle longer. Just Ailwin called stairs,-- "I say, Oliver, cow alive. I heard her low, I am certain." "I afraid George," said Mildred. "He lowing like cow, minute ago." "That might he heard real cow," cried Oliver, new hope. "I rather save cow anything. I see I cannot get one upper rooms looks towards yard. We might bridge-rope windows one. Where Roger? What he fit for? Is he awake?" "Awake! Yes, indeed," whispered Ailwin, coming close children. "There mischief boy think for. He stairs, mice, rats, spiders, creeping things I ever saw days. We like devoured stand feet; say nothing become us lie down." Mildred looked her brother great terror. "We must get rid them, really us hurt," said Oliver, decidedly, though anxious look. "We must drown them, mischievous. We that, know--at least larger things. They cannot get away us." "Drown away!" said Ailwin, mysteriously. "Drown away! The drown come up. Why, never hear plagues Egypt?" "Yes, sure. What then?" "I take plague Egypt boy brought upon us. It his doing; see that, look I stand, watch making friends all." Mildred's eyes her brother's face he stood Ailwin desired him, watching Roger. After looking thoughtful moments, he turned exclaimed,-- "There one word sense all, Mildred. There wonderful number live things there, sure; here, too, roof--if look. But Roger making friends them. He teasing them--hurting he get hold of. I think creatures come water driven holes; would quite many Roger drowned carr. They nothing Roger, plagues Egypt, Mildred. Do not believe word it." "Then I wish Ailwin would say things," replied Mildred. Ailwin persisted time would show Roger was--to agreed. Oliver observed meanwhile Ailwin, oldest person among them, try frighten little girl, youngest all, except George. Ailwin said she keep her thoughts; though, sure, she need always say everybody. "About cow," thought Oliver, aloud. "We must plan way feed her." "Take care!" exclaimed Mildred, he began descend stairs. But words scarcely her mouth her brother called her water sunk. She ran see, saw, her eyes, water quite come wet mark left wall stairs. Ailwin thought little it--it trifle; Oliver allowed might mere accident, arising flood found new vent house; still, water sunk; sight full hope. "Have heard cow low, Roger?" asked Oliver. "Yes, sure. She may well low; she must hungry enough." "And wet cold enough, too, poor thing! I going see whether, I find exactly she is, whether cannot something her." Ailwin called down-stairs Oliver, say washtub floating room slept in. If he could find it, he might row that, chambers, instead always wading water, catching his death cold. Oliver took hint, presently appeared tub, rowing slip wood he brought Red-hill. Roger stared he rowed one chamber, opened door another, entering fine style. Roger presently followed see doing, perhaps try he liked voyage tub large chamber. "I see her," cried Oliver, window. "I see poor cow's head, ridge her back water." Roger came splashing window look, jumped tub, making sink good deal; held boys well. Roger thought cow stupid she get upon great dunghill behind her, would keep her whole body water. Oliver thought that, dunghill behind her, she could see it. He wished he could go, put her mind it. He thought he would try cross tub, he could connect window might drawn back, case his unable pass little current house ruins yard-buildings--of little remained. "I will go, too," said Roger. "Either go, I," said Oliver. "One must stay manage rope, case tub upsetting. You better let go, Roger, poor cow knows me." Roger, however, chose go. Oliver asked whether he could milk cow; milk must got George, possible. He said, gravely, his poor little brother would die, he thought, could get milk him. Roger laughed doubt whether he could milk cows. He every day his life, fishing fowling, his uncle, carr. Oliver guessed milk good cow sometimes unaccountably run short. Ailwin observed never happened Redfurns neighbourhood; she always insisted upon bewitched cow. Oliver knew she would say now. He said much, said seriously, necessity milk little George, he thought even Redfurn could heart drink milk. He gave Roger brown pitcher milk, helped, cleverly, fasten cord tub. They passed cord back heavy old-fashioned chair stood room, lest sudden pull throw Oliver window; he established window-sill, water, manage his line, watch Roger would do. Roger pulled skilfully;--much so, his strength practice, Oliver could done. He avoided logs wood, trees, heavy things floated past; nearly he till line quite run out, he could carried down. Then he began diligently working his way towards cow. He got half-way his object, he paused moment, changed his course--to Oliver's surprise; thing appeared attracted his attention small copper boiler. Plenty things swept past before, nobody thought wanting them. It plain, however, Roger fancy particular copper boiler; he carefully waylaid it, arrested his paddle. Oliver saw live animal leaped boiler tub. He saw Roger seize boiler, take tub; catch animal, whatever might be, nurse his arms; take something his pocket, stoop down. Oliver pretty sure he killing something his knife. Whatever Roger he soon done. By time he carried far line would allow; additional weight he board his tub made harder work paddle again. He it, however, brought his odd little boat still water, dunghill cow. After looking while, he threw boiler pitcher upon dunghill, seized pitchfork stuck upright it, and, his craft thus lightened, made ruins cart she would stable. Of buildings remained wrecks walls, beams rafters standing air, lying across other, without thatch cover them. Something must left inside, however; Roger busy his pitchfork. This something must valuable, too; Roger, carefully feeling depth, jumped tub, went filling it, he stood water. Oliver thought daring, till, glancing cow, he sure he saw her neck back; examining wall house, he perceived flood sunk inches since Roger began cross. When tub heaped looked like wet straw, Roger pushed towards cow, carefully feeling his way, never sinking much water his shoulders. "Capital! Now clever!" said Oliver, aloud, he sat window, saw Roger about. "He going lift her water. How she struggles help herself! She knows somebody caring her; she she herself." This true. Roger thrust straw he brought cow, his pitchfork. He bring three loads she could raise her whole body; she stood, poor thing! With her trembling legs water. Roger turned her head she saw dunghill behind her, encouragement, made one vigorous scramble reach it. She succeeded; Roger whipped pitcher, certainly trying milk her. She could not, however, prevented lying down. Oliver angry he almost ever his life, he saw Roger kick her repeatedly, different parts her body, pull her tail, haul her head rope he found stable. The poor cow never attempted rise; clear she wanted comfort, ill-usage. Oliver determined that, Roger came back, he would speak word him. Roger set returning presently, he found nothing could got cow. He took his boiler board, pulled line, without troubling paddle. When he came window, he threw pitcher, swearing trouble he taken good-for-nothing beast standing starving water till she drop milk give. He looked Oliver, rather surprised he speak; Oliver took notice him. It hare Roger his boiler,--a hare had, doubt, leaped boiler pressed still urgent danger sailing stream boat. Roger cut her throat his pocket-knife; she lay her blood. "Do not touch that," said Roger, he landed his booty upon window-sill. "If lay finger that, worse you. They mine--both puss boiler." Still Oliver speak. He wondered Roger meant things, nobody else touch them. Roger soon made clear his intentions were. He whistled his dog, scampered down-stairs top house; put dog, puss, boiler clothes' basket, pulled Red-hill, taking care carry tinder-box him. There he made fire, skinned cooked his hare, and, his dog, made feast it, tree. Nobody grudged his feast; though children sorry find one could selfish. Ailwin glad rid him, terms; and, soon Oliver sure he occupied time come, he would returning make mischief, he resolved go cow, give her something better kicks;--food, if, he thought, he could procure some. Saying nothing one, he tied tub-line bed-post, trustworthy still heavy chair, carried great knife meat cut evening before. He made stable first, joined rope he knew his line, make twice length before. He could reach field behind stable, corn, turning green yellow, standing high hour yesterday. He paddle carefully here, lest his tub knocked pieces stone wall. But wall, though altogether thrown down, many breaches made it, he found field, without exactly knowing whether he come gate-posts wall. He lost time digging his paddle; and, he hoped, he turned ears corn water, he could catch hold of, handful time, cut his knife. It tiresome, slow work; sometimes he near losing his paddle, sometimes his knife. He persevered, however: resting minute two, eating ears, thinking hungry people could swallow them, soaked bad water. He ate he would done, remembering he took now, less he want portion he meant carry house, he fed cow. He hoped obtain better food; but, flour had, vegetable this, would better none. When he reached cow, she devoured heads corn ravenously. She could appeared better satisfied sweetest spring grass. It pleasure see her eyes she lay, receiving her food Oliver's hand. He emptied he brought beside her, patted her, saying he hoped she would give George milk afternoon, return done her now. Oliver felt tired weak he got home his tub half full soaked corn ears, he felt he could anything more. He near crying he found morsel eat; water bad drink; fire, Roger carried tinder-box. But George crying hunger; made Oliver ashamed same, put upon thinking done next. Ailwin person who, strong Roger could got anything force; use asking Ailwin cross bridge-rope, anything would bring her nearer boy she feared much. Besides that, Roger carried clothes' basket without leaving line pull back by. Oliver felt he (if he little less hungry tired) could make trip sack, tub, even kettle; tall woman like Ailwin could cross nothing smaller missing clothes' basket. It clear Oliver alone could go; he must go tinder-box comfort had. He made his mind this, therefore; having, Ailwin's help, slung useful tub upon bridge-rope, he might start first moment Roger sight asleep, he rested window, watching passed Red-hill. He observed Roger seemed quite secure one could follow him, he carried basket. There he lay, near fire, eating meat he broiled, playing his dog. It seemed hungry watchers he meant lie day. After awhile, however, he rose, sauntered towards trees, among he disappeared, going side hill, play, set his dog upon game. Oliver off, sliding along bridge-rope his tub. He forget carry line bring back basket. It seemed Roger intended live Red-hill; none party objection. He swum house once, stream higher rapid now; he could come again, he found really want anything; nobody need anxious him. Meantime, one house desired his company. Oliver therefore took blanket rug, knife fork his accommodation. He alighted beech without difficulty, laid articles he brought tree, Roger would sure see them. He took flint tinder tinder-box, pocketed them, leaving steel box Roger's use, knives home, Roger might perhaps find flint hill. There plenty quarry. Oliver knew he must quick; he could help looking round something eat,--some one many animals birds he knew hill, heard moving every side. But he means catching any. The bones hare lying about, picked quite clean dog; morsel meat left sight. Something precious, however, caught Oliver's eye;--a great heap pebbly gravel thrown flood. The water Levels usually bad settlers filter it; Oliver knew water purer filtered gravel. He believed poor George could good drink water, least; he scooped his hands enough gravel half fill tub. It took long time heap much he could carry upon rug; hard work empty tub; he fancied every moment he heard Roger coming. It pity he know Roger fallen fast asleep sun, side hill; his dog lay winking beside him, thinking stirring. One thing must had;--chips fuel. When Oliver got enough these, sticks too, he found courage strength stay minutes more, make fire Roger would probably last till he discovered loss flint, prevent his without fire till he could find another flint. In order give broad hint, Oliver spread blanket ground, set tinder-box middle it, would sure invite attention. He climbed tub, glad off, drawing basket fire-wood him. "Here, Ailwin," said he, faintly, he reached window, "take flint tinder, wood basket, make fire. I brought nothing eat." "No need!" said Ailwin, uncommonly merry countenance. "You must broil green corn, unless manage get fowl across yard. But I really cannot go errands till I rested," said Oliver, dismally. "No need, Oliver dear!" said Ailwin again. "What think found eat?" cried Mildred, stairs.--"What matter him, Ailwin? Why he speak?" "He tired, he know do," said Ailwin. "No, do not get water again, dear. I will carry you. Put arm round neck, I will carry you." And good-natured woman carried roof, laid bundle bedding there, promising bring breakfast presently. She threw apron his head, cover hot sun, bade lie still, think anything till she came. "Only one thing," said Oliver. "Take particular care gravel tub." "Gravel!" exclaimed Ailwin. "The fowls eat gravel; I do not see can. However, shall way, Oliver." The tired boy asleep moment. He knew nothing till he felt vexed somebody is trying wake him. It Mildred. He heard her say,-- "How sound asleep he is! I cannot make stir. Here, Oliver,-- eat this, go sleep directly." He tried rouse himself, sat up; his eyes dim, light dazzling, he could see, first, Mildred her hands. It one her mother's best china plates,--one set kept closet up-stairs; upon nice brown toasted fish, steaming hot. "Is me?" asked Oliver, rubbing his eyes. "Yes, indeed, you?" said Ailwin, whose smiling face popped stairs. "Who deserves it, not, I like know? It good I could wished, though, Oliver. I could broil it, want butter everything; salt, know. But, come! Eat it, is. Come, begin!" "But got too?" asked hungry boy, he eyed fish. "Oh, yes,--George all," said Mildred. "We ate first, sound asleep, like wake you." "How long I asleep?" asked Oliver, beginning heartily upon his fish. "How could get nice fish? How busy must time I asleep!" "All time!" exclaimed Mildred. "Why, asleep half hour; hardly much. We lighted fire, cooked fish, fed Geordie, put sleep, got breakfast;--and long that,--we hungry! That done since went sleep." "It seems great deal half hour," said Oliver. "How good fish is! Where get it?" "I found stairs. Ah! I thought would believe it; shall find more, I dare say, water sinks; believe see." "On stairs! How get there?" "The way water got there, I suppose, poor little drowned pig lay close place. There whole heap fish washed turn stairs; enough us to-day. Ailwin said must eat first, pig keep. Such nice little clean sucking-pig!" "That puts mind poor sow," said Oliver. "I forgot her busy cow. I afraid she drowned starved this; must see it." "Not now," said Mildred. "Do go sleep now. There hurry was, waters going fast." "Are they, indeed?--Oh, I want sleep more. I quite wide awake now. Are sure flood going down?" "Only look! Look steep red bank Red-hill, green slope yesterday, covered water morning. Look little speck hillock, neighbour Gool's house was. We could see morning, I sure. And come down, find scarcely water upper rooms now. Geordie might play paddling there, he fond his tub. Ailwin thinks might sleep to-night, could get everything dried." "We might get many things dried night, sun this. How hot is!" Oliver ran down, convinced flood abating fast. It must swelled higher within house outside; sunk three feet upper rooms, two outer walls house. Now worst danger seemed past, children worked fresh spirit, making possible use sunshine drying bedding clothes, hopes sleeping chamber night, instead house-top, feared would necessary. Nothing could made believe, told sunrise, cheerfully would sit down, afternoon, rest talk, hope might, all, meet father mother soon, alive well. CHAPTER SIX. ROGER HIS OWN MASTER. There lay Roger tree, thinking nothing prevent his his way now, he going happy. He always thought hard he could his way entirely, unsatisfied much greater degree liberty people wish have. He hitherto led wandering life, home duties, school go to, trade work at,--no garden, pleasure, fix one spot. He gone, his uncle, sporting moors, one season year, sporting marshes another; and, wild way life, made his much wilder, he always wishing liberty still. When his aunt desired watch kettle, hung fire near tent, asked help her shaking bedding, cleaning utensils, he turned sulky, wished he lived alone, he need plagued people's affairs. When his uncle ordered attend certain spot hour, nets gun, he will not feel seized sudden desire wander opposite direction, lie half asleep sun, lazy work all. When he played truant, returned late tent, found nothing better left eat dry crust bread, cold remains mess fish, he frequently thought pleasant would best everything himself, his dog eat rest. So boy often felt thought; would many think feel, perhaps, many forlorn friendless he, one love loved by. Though he uncle aunt, he never friend. He knew cared he could help keep tent, take game; and, feeling this, irksome orders. The time come he often longed. He his master completely. There nobody near could order compel anything; he, his part, obedient servant his dog. The sky blue warm overhead, trees cast pleasant shade. The Red-hill island, he himself; richly stocked game, his food sport. Here he could his way, completely happy. Such Roger's idea he stole tinder-box, crossed hill; he said he cooked his meal, he lay grass, bees humming round him, sound waters pleasant ripple, instead rush roar yesterday. He desired his dog lie down, disturb him; he took opportunity change animal's name. Stephen Redfurn, taking quarrel day bishops, would dog called "Bishop," nothing else. Roger always wished call "Spy;" Bishop would never answer name Spy, even seem hear it. Now, however, Bishop Spy, one indulge dog his old name; Spy told many times over, devices could thought impressing fact his memory. This lesson given, Roger shut his eyes, thought he would sleep long he chose; but, first place, he found much heated sleep. He considered wonder, broiling making fire broil his hare. He wished animals ran ready cooked--as fruits grow sunny side trees. It bad bustle toil hour, get ready eaten ten minutes; passed his mind that, whatever Nan Redfurn might sometimes said done him, she usually saved trouble cooking, his meals ready whenever he chose tent meal times. He rose, thought he could find cooler place, trees. He so, lay down. Sleep began steal him; and, time, thought crept his mind he never see Stephen Redfurn. The ideas come one dropping asleep vivid; one startled Roger so, Spy found out, pricked his ears, alarm. This thought would go away; happened last words Stephen Roger spoken together angry ones. Stephen ordered Roger carry fry fished manure field, he promised deposit certain time. Roger sure fish would better lying sun longer, refused touch it. No matter right manure; wrong angry. Stephen said Roger young rascal, would never come good; Roger looked impertinently his uncle's face, whistling dog come him, make sport among water-fowl. It face--that countenance his uncle's, he last seen it, Roger's eyes now, he lay dozing. With came angry tones Stephen's voice, saying he would never come good. Mixed confused roar coming flood, question (how whence spoken he knew not) whether his uncle might possibly saved, he not, orders, carried away Bishop--for dog still Bishop his master's dreams. Roger started bolt upright, looked him. He felt tired; he thought he would lie yet. It odd he could get sound asleep, tired he was. If he sleep better night, he do? He wished he woman's cherry-brandy. He slept sound enough drinking that. It well Roger he within reach intoxicating liquors--the state his mind would probably made drunkard him. His mind ran strangely his uncle, his uncle's last looks words, even he stood wide awake, staring bee-hives. A rustle briars behind made jump he shot. It partridge taking wing. "Whirr away!" said Roger her. "You cannot go far. You light upon island. You belong me--you swarming creatures! You may run awhile, flutter away bit; belong last, Spy help me. I will sport, now. Here, Spy! Spy!" Spy disappeared, come called. A whistle brought him, however, last. He came thicket, licking his chops. Being commanded bring his game, he soon produced two rabbits. It easy work dog catch them; poor creatures holes here. They come raised ground warren way off, soaked holes. Spy praised everything answering his name. For he lectured, sent again, try he could find. He brought prey various kinds; he could stir among trees without starting some. During fun, Roger thought it, terrified birds fluttering among branches trees, scared animals bursting thicket, Roger resolved he would plague thoughts Stephen Nan. If drowned, none his doing; and, Stephen's anger yesterday, nothing new that; Stephen angry every day his life. He would scared his sleep nonsense. He would give his way see Stephen Nan trees; and, he got his way last, he would enjoy it. This mood went till heap dead animals, Roger began think whether he could skin all, clean skins, hot weather this, unfit use. As eating them, twenty times much food could eaten good. He remember children Ailwin, much probably wanted food; he settled business his; he going trouble leave his island anybody. He would call Spy, tie up; must game killed to-day. Spy come calling,--for anything short well-known whistle, Roger would utter name Bishop. Roger grew angry obeyed better this; his last whistle shrill dog seemed know threatened, refused answer long he dared, came unwillingly, fear every attitude. He gave low whine he saw his master; he good reason do. Roger tied tree, gave loose his passion. He thrashed dog switch till poor creature's whine heard pitied children Ailwin house-top; knowing long whipping might gone on, animal last turned furious, snapped Roger way made think giving over, finding something else his sovereignty. He found rather dull work, far, his way, island his own. At last, he bethought amusement he fond he lived much moors carrs. He bethought bird's-nesting. It late eggs; he thought bird-families might dispersed. Here plenty trees, must full birds; for, though silent to-day (he wish place quite silent!) sometimes sent warblings far carr, Nan Redfurn would mention tent. He would see ailed them, would give music to-day. By incessant cooing, he obtained answer one solitary pigeon; he took advantage climb tree, look nest. He found nest; nothing it. He climbed several trees, found abundance nests; deserted. Except his solitary pigeon (which presently vanished), appeared winged creature trees. The birds frightened away roar flood yesterday; and, perhaps, seeing fields, will not resort food, turned waste muddy waters. Roger threw ground every empty nest he found, common inability boy keep his hands bird's-nest. When he tired climbing trees, he picked scattered nests, laid long row grass. They looked dismal enough. It disagreeable see range houses left half-built (such may seen neighbourhood large towns), doorways gaping, window-spaces empty, roofs hardly covering dark inside; row houses less dismal Roger's array birds'-nests. There something make bird's-nest rouses thoughts blue red-spotted eggs, callow young birds, large hungry eyes beaks, twittering fledglings, training summer life pleasure. To see, instead these, silent empty habitations, extended long row, would enough make one dull sad. So Roger found. He kicked heap tree, thought would make fine crackling fire. He would burn them, every one. While he wondering whether birds would come back miss nests, struck he thought he pass night. It nothing new sleep open air. He liked best season. But he usually rug lie upon, tent him; blanket; or, worst, he sack creep into. The clothes he old thin; he looked them, made angry think he everything he liked it, all. Here he pass cold night, nothing hard ground. He thought gathering leaves, moss, high grass, roll in, like squirrel hole; trouble he like. He stood listlessly thinking much trouble would cost collect moss leaves purpose; and, he thinking, he went pelting his dog birds'-nests, seeing angry dog, unable get loose, snapped shook pieces nests fell within his reach. Roger knew he ought skinning dead animals, he really meant secure skins, late; also troublesome. Instead this, he went round hill, see Linacres about, resolving means appear see them, making signs window things back he carried away. On coming shade side hill, he surprised see smoke still going his fire, considering fire nearly he left it. Something strange met his eye he ran forward. There nice clean blanket spread ground, tinder-box middle. "Somebody here!" cried Roger, much offended. "What business anybody island? Coming back turned! If I heard coming meddle--!" Just then, his eye fell rug, blanket, knife fork left Oliver,--the accommodation he wishing for, more. When he felt thick warm rug, he gave his anger one entered his island without his leave, and, moment, felt pleased happy. But he saw bridge-basket gone-- people means coming upon pleased--he angry he day. "However," thought he, "I got house anyone else crossed water, I whenever I please. I swim Spy, bring away anything I like, busy side, good-for-nothing cow, something. That tit-for-tat." He doubly mistaken here. His going steal comforts Linacres would tit-for-tat Oliver's coming his father's hill, bring away his mother's clothes basket, leave comforts unwelcome visitor! Neither could Roger enter Linacres' dwelling he pleased, swimming stream. He saw he examined considered. The water sunk show inches top entrance-door lower windows. It high enough allow his getting upper window, he yesterday; high entrance below. The stream appeared rapid strong ever; shot force carr vehemently first; almost, quite deep ever. It worn away soil bottom channel, nearly quite depth sunk surface; still working walls foundation house, soil hill, much force first hour. When Roger examined red precipice he looked upon rushing stream, he perceived yard Linacres' garden could existence. That garden, flourishing vegetables, rare, gay, sweet flowers, laden fruit trees,--that garden he Stephen could help admiring, told everybody business middle carr,--that garden, earth plants, spread ruins marsh; instead would found, waters could dried up, deep, gravelly, stony watercourse, channel red mud. Roger wondered whether boy girl aware fate garden; whether supposed everything stood fast order waters. He wanted point truth them; looked chamber window, hopes might watching it. No one there, however. On glancing higher, he saw sitting within balustrade roof. They looking another way, appearing think all. He watched long while; never turned towards Red-hill. He could made hear calling; might think he wished them, wanted something them, instead understanding he desired tell pretty garden destroyed. So he began settle his dead game he would supper, fed his fire, order cook it. He thought he liked bird supper,--a pheasant partridge instead rabbit leveret; he plenty. He felt provoking he neither net gun, securing feathered game, much hill; he must put four-footed game, he rather bird. There bread either, vegetables; he minded less, neither hand, he often lived long time together animal food. During whole time his listless preparations cooking his supper, he glanced occasionally roof; he never saw party look his way. He thought odd care much less him, he knew Stephen he came carr. They neither seemed want fear to-day. At length he went set Spy loose, order feed him, companion, he felt rather dull, seeing busily party house-top talking. When he returned Spy, sun set, one house-top. A faint light chamber window told Ailwin children there. Roger wondered managed kindle fire, he tinder-box. He learned truth, soon after, upsetting tinder-box, he moved blanket. The steel fell out; flint tinder found absent. In his present mood he considered prodigious impertinence impose upon labour finding flint next day, choice whether make tinder bit his shirt, use shavings wood instead. He determined show, meanwhile, he plenty fire to-night, therefore heaped high, danger lower branches ash he sat would shrivel heat. No blaze he could make, however, could conceal his view cheerful light chamber window. There certainly good fire within; sat beside probably better companions Spy him. The dog dull would play; Roger soon felt tired, something, wish play. He could conceal he much like chamber light shone, even though cherry-brandy now. The stars beginning drop sky, waste waters still looked yellow bright west; Roger's first day his way quite long enough; he spread his rug, rolled his blanket night. Spy, invited, drew near, lay too. Roger still overheated, made enormous fire; he muffled his head his blanket, he afraid lest even his dog see he crying. CHAPTER SEVEN. ROGER NOT HIS OWN MASTER. More long night, Roger heard strange sounds; Spy repeatedly raised his head, seemed uneasy. Above constant flow stream, came occasionally sort roar, rumble splash, stream appeared flow faster. Once Roger rose belief house,--the firm, substantial, stone house,--was washed down. But so. There moon time night he looked forth; clear starlight; stood dark mass building midst grey waters. Roger vowed he would get his warm rug again, false alarm; lay till broad daylight, sometimes quite asleep, sometimes drowsily, resolving he would think uncle Stephen, except day-time. Soon sunrise, however, renewed rumble splash roused open his eyes wide. What he saw made jump up, run edge precipice, see he could. The greater part roof house gone; cracks solid stone walls yellow sunshine found way. One portion wall leaned in; another leaned towards water. At first Roger expected see whole building crumble stream, supposed inhabitants might swept quite away. He gazed strange feeling creature might left alive habitation. Roger's heart sank within idea his solitude, indeed case. He nothing fear his safety. The Red-hill would swept away. He could live he long time come; till steps taken repairing damage flood; till explorers arrive boat; he doubt would happen soon. It his safety Roger anxious; frightened think entirely alone place this, bodies he knew best lying waters every side him. If he could Oliver speak to, even little George, would make difference him. He really hoped left alive. When he began consider, he perceived bridge-rope remained, stretched tight ever. The chamber window, indeed wall house, looked firm safe; roof left part. This natural enough, violence flood much greater opposite side house garden side. The staircase safe. It laid open view curiously; stood upright steady: and, length, Roger's great relief, Mildred appeared upon it. She merely ran fetch something roof; her step, her run jump, was, Roger's mind, different would she great affliction fear. In his pleasure this, he snatched his cap his head, waved it: little girl busy, she see him. It odd, Roger said himself, Linacres always thinking everything him, formerly could never watch enough. After he descended bank, fill his boiler water. It necessary time drinking, order mud might settle. Even standing several hours, day before, water far clear; far sweet. This nothing new Roger, however, accustomed drink water like often he settled carr, though he occasionally allowed mix gin his uncle's bottle. He thirsty enough morning drink almost anything; he think water boiler looked particularly muddy disagreeable. Spy seemed thirsty himself, little disposed drink stream ran below. He pranced boiler, watching opportunity wet his tongue, his master turn his back minute. The opportunity soon came; Roger saw bridge-basket put window Ailwin; which, Oliver got it. Ailwin handed something, he pulled away Red-hill. With skip jump Roger ran beach await him. "Pull away! That is right! Glad see you!" exclaimed Roger. "Halloo, Spy! Down, sir! Pleased see you, Oliver." Oliver glad hear words. He know he might met abuse violence, carried home basket. "Would like milk?" asked Oliver, he came near. "Ay, I should," replied Roger. "Leave yonder water dog, then, drink this," said Oliver, handing small tin can. "You must let can, though. Almost kitchen things floated wall, breach see, night. You must give again, would like I bring milk afternoon. The poor cow badly, cannot feed her like: she given milk enough George morning, little spare us you. You seem like it," he added, laughing see Roger smacked his lips draught. "That I do. It good stuff, I know," said Roger, he drained last drop. "Then I bring afternoon, spare poor George's supper." "That is pity. You have enough do, I think. Suppose I come over. Eh?" "There something said that," replied Oliver, gravely. "We want keep ourselves. We got chest meal, morning." "A chest meal!" "Yes: large chest, wet all, except inch deep round outside. We caught floating by; like it, bread here: know, Roger, kicked poor cow she weak stand; carried away tinder-box knew fire. We do not want us things: I think I better bring meal here. And yet pity; broth Ailwin making good." "I will come over," said Roger. "I stronger you, I help feed cow, everything." "I that, Ailwin help: I sure Mildred much rather stay here, unless behave differently. And poor little George, too! He well, like he frightened." "I shall not frighten anybody, you will see. You better let come; Spy I bring lot game." "We do not want game, present. We plenty eat." "You better let come help you. I will not hurt George, anything. Come, I promise shall not repent good turn." "Then shall come, Roger. But remember Mildred little girl; consider poor Geordie too; he quite ill. You will not tease him? Well, here is line. Come soon please, I landed." Oliver basket, reach, conversation. He flung basket line, returned. Roger long following, his game, fire-wood, his dog. He left his bedding hidden thicket, tinder-box dry hole tree, he might come back his island time, case quarrel Linacres. Poor little George indeed look ill. He lying across Mildred's lap, fretful, his cheeks burning hot, his lips dry, his mouth sore. Ailwin put charm round his neck day before; he seem better it. Busy she was, she tied another moment she heard Oliver Roger coming. When Roger basket darkened window, Ailwin Mildred called once, "Here he is!" George turned his hot head way, repeated, "Here he is!" "Yes, I am! And here is I brought," said Roger, throwing two rabbits leveret. He took leveret presently, brought George, he might feel soft fur was. The child flinched first, persuaded, length, stroke leveret's back, play paws. "That boy good all," thought Ailwin, "unless trick. It trick, I will bound." "You tight dry enough here," said Roger, glancing round room. "By look house hill, I thought ruins." The minds Ailwin Mildred full events night; forgot Roger speaking told terrors been. Ailwin started middle night, run door; and, opening it, seen stars shining bright house. The roof side house clean gone. When Mildred looked place sunrise, she saw water spread almost her feet. The floor landing-place, ceiling one lower rooms broken up, planks floating about. "Where they?" asked Roger, quickly. "To sure let float off, along kitchen things got away wall?" Mildred know care taken planks. Roger see, saying might glad every foot plank could lay hands on. Ailwin Mildred saw either boys whole morning. They might looked discover doing, neither liked sight bare rafters overhead, watery precipice feet. So Ailwin went making cakes curious sort, she said; cakes meal, made milk water, without either yeast salt. They would spoiled water; could said them. The water filtered gravel turned quite good enough used cooking, even poor George drink, thirsty he was. While fowl simmered pot, cakes lay toasting hob, Ailwin busied herself making beds, rubbing, her strong arm, everything room, helping floor, walls, furniture dry wetting yesterday. From smell, she said, she thought everything house growing mouldy her face. They aware bad smell observed yesterday, growing worse every hour. Roger much struck moment he entered window. When boys length appeared, say hungry were, burst like two schoolfellows trying new game, little lads others depending subsistence midst heavy calamity. They made raft--a real stout, broad raft, would use (now currents slackening) anything attempted yet. Oliver told among many things current brought poor neighbour Gool's, lot harness his stables. Roger seen strong fastenings harness would make raft. They crossed stable, found suit harness hanging safe wall remained. They tied planks three stout beams, pulled ruined part house wall. It pretty hard work; raft secure, well fastened, moreover, door-post, long line; might row without always looking carried abroad carr. Oliver really thought almost good boat. Roger protested better, would hold goods: brother sister could think raft best two, remembered boat would carry them, perhaps, mother's arms. Oliver knew Mildred thinking he said,-- "We must dream getting away raft, dear. It would upset currents twenty times, place hills." "Well, that?" said Roger. "Who wants get hills? We got want good here. We take pleasure, live free wild-ducks pond nobody comes near." Roger quite spirits good humour. It may seem strange boy lazy day before, wish hares ran ready roasted, work hard day severe job making raft. But natural enough. There nothing interesting dull discontented person, alone, preparing meal his self eat: something animating planning clever job, set immediately--a ready willing companion hand help, talk with. There also something immediate gained finishing raft. One thing another floating every quarter hour, would worth seize bring home. As Roger saw, hay-cock, man's hat, float by, he worked harder harder, treasures possible might thus lost. Oliver felt much way, particularly his want hat cap. Ailwin made tie handkerchief round his head; heated him, without saving much scorching sun his head, glare waters his eyes. Ailwin looked compliments her cookery hungry boys; forgot, eagerness raft, treat days meal-cakes; ate talked, without thinking much putting mouths. When went see could find, told Mildred would liked go them. She want her dinner, Ailwin said two would sit comfortably. She mind precipice broken walls, staring rafters. She longed stand somewhere, see boys take prizes stream. She held poor George morning; he would let her put bed. Her back ached, her arms stiff, her heart sick his crying. He fretting wailing ever since daylight; Mildred felt she could bear one minute longer. Just she heard laugh boys outside; Ailwin began sing, she always putting away pots pans. Nobody seemed care: nobody seemed think her; Mildred remembered different would her mother there. Her mother would thinking poor George morning: her mother would thought her too; would remembered she must tired; cheered her talk, saying something hopeful poor baby. When Ailwin stopped her loud singing, moment, considering corner she set her stew-pan, she heard gentle sob. Looking round, she saw Mildred's face covered tears. "What is matter now, dear?" said she. "Is baby worse? No,--he do not seem worse me." "I do not know, I am sure. But, Ailwin, I tired, I do not know do; I cannot bear hear cry so. He crying way to-day; longest day I ever knew." "Well, I am sure I wish could think anything would quiet him. If his go-cart, now, his wooden lamb, white wool upon it, he fond ... But water below." "But could take little while, Ailwin, I glad! I would wash dishes you." "Take him! Oh, that is at! To sure I will; I might thought before,--only I pans things put away. I will wash hands directly, take him:--only, much use washing one's hands: foul damp smell seems stick everything one touches. It boy's doing, depend upon it. He bottom mischief.--Ay, Mildred, need object I say. After I saw yesterday morning, plague animals stairs, never persuade he league bad creatures, good way off. I do not half like Oliver's raft, stream there. That raft wonderfully ready made two slips boys." "They planks ready hands," said Mildred, trembling; "and leather harness ropes tie with. I think might said. What harm suppose happen, Ailwin? I sure Oliver would nothing wrong, making raft, anything else.--O dear! I wish George would cry so!" "Here, give me," said Ailwin, washed her hands, taken her cooking apron. "There, go finish dishes, play,--there is dear! And do not think George, Roger, raft, anything vex you,--there is dear!" Ailwin gave Mildred smacking kiss, she received little George her; and, though Mildred could not, she bid, put away vexing thoughts, she cheered Ailwin's good-will. She soon done washing plates used, though she washing greatest care, her mother's best china, brought Holland, kept up-stairs cupboard,--ready, seemed, serve present party, must otherwise gone without plates cups, common sets water,-- broken pieces, doubt, time.--George already quieter he day; Mildred felt less scruple going amuse herself,--or rather, watch her brother; she hardly dared take pleasure raft, Ailwin said; though she kept repeating herself nonsense, Ailwin often talked; Mrs Linacre said her children must neither believe laugh at. Mildred went top staircase, stood firm, though building fallen away almost every side it. It rather giddy affair first, sitting top stair spiral staircase part walls gone, bare rafters roof let water seen them. Mildred soon grew accustomed her place, however, fixed her eyes raft boys plying stream. She supposed caught hay-cock; cow eating, industriously,--no longer dunghill, slip ground left dry stable. The cow company share her good cheer: whether invited uninvited, saying. A strange pony there; sheep, well-grown calf. These animals pressed upon one another narrow space ground, thrusting heads one another's necks, snatch hay. "How hungry are!" thought Mildred, "and tease one another!" She remembered read men starving boat sea, became selfish animals snatching one another last remaining morsels food. She hoped she Oliver starved, last, middle flood: were, she believe Oliver she could ever snatch food other, help Geordie, whatever Roger might do, even Ailwin. Ailwin kind good-tempered; she apt hungry! However, occasion think want food yet. The meal wetted, round sides lid chest, served well feed fowls; seemed find something worth picking mud slime waters left behind sank. The poor sow farrowed too. She her little pigs found almost dead hunger wet: meal-chest come time save them. Ailwin said worth spare meal; little pigs, mother well fed, would give many good dinner. There occasion fear want food present. The boys raft middle stream, working away broad paddles, evidently wishing catch something floating down. Mildred could see small tree bobbing about, sometimes showing roots water, sometimes leafy branches. What could want young tree, well drier fire-wood would make? They determined it, clear; Roger threw his paddle neared tree, caught long rope, gave cast towards branching top rope went air, Mildred saw noose end. The noose caught:--the tree gave topple water, found stopped course jerk; boys set shout pulled house, hauling prize them. Mildred ran stairs far she dared,--almost brink water. There she near enough see hear doing. The tree apple-tree; though ripest apples gone, good many left, would treat cooked. The boys saw her watching them, Roger said fair she stand idle working like horses:--why she gather apples knocked off, instead keeping people stream girls' work? Oliver said she useful anybody day; she she liked now. He called Mildred; asked her whether she like gather apples tree, went see else could find. Mildred replied she like much, could bring tree place she was. Ailwin would find something her put apples in. Neither raft tree, however, could got breach wall. Oliver fetched tub, discarded since raft thought of. He rowed staircase tub, asked Mildred she afraid cross yards wall. He would find her nice seat wall, she could sit plucking apples, seeing raft. He would sure come, her, soon she make signal him. Meantime, tub would hold apples. Mildred great fancy sharing boys' adventures; though tub looked small, unsteady boat, she ventured slide it, sit it, her brother rowed her broken wall. She silent Oliver thought she frightened; she considering whether tell Ailwin's fears his raft Roger. Before she decided, come within hearing Roger, late. After finding steady broad stone wall her sit on, Oliver chose stay little while, cut break trunk branches fruit them. This would make Mildred's work much easier. Oliver also chose, spite Roger could say, leave her one paddles. He considered (though he say it) accident might possibly happen raft, prevent returning her: he declared Mildred oar row herself with, she mind join Ailwin, moment, instead waiting she was. So moored tub inside house wall, apple-tree outside, established Mildred good seat between, boys pushed again. Mildred found she undertaken wet dirty task. The branches apple-tree dripping, fruit covered slime; things must minded times flood. So she went on, often looking away, however, wonder things swept past her, watch proceedings boys. After while, she became bold consider curious thing would she, without raft, pick article valuable swum stream. This thought put her head seeing something occasionally flap upon surface muddy water, spread below. It looked her like tail coat, skirt petticoat. She fish her paddle, occurred her might clothing drowned person. She shrank back thought, first terror dead body near her, called Oliver's name. He hear; she would repeat call she saw busy he was. She tried think piece cloth; came perpetually her eyes, flap, flapping, till she felt would best satisfy herself once, was. She poked her paddle underneath flap, found caught held something heavy. She tugged hard it, raised blue cloth. She believe body now; she laid hold cloth drew in. It heavy itself, made wet, little girl set her foot stone wall, employ her strength, she could land cloth, yard yard, upon wall. It piece home-spun, probably laid grass field Levels, dyeing, carried away. When Mildred pulled vast quantity, resistance;--the rest would come. Perhaps something heavy lodged upon it, kept down. Again she used her paddle, setting her feet one stone, pressing her back another, give her power. In midst effort, stone behind her gave way. It her paddle now, resting support water, saved her popping water great stone. As was, she swayed upon her seat, nearly gone, heavy stone slid in, raised splash wetted her head foot, left her trembling every limb. She fancied, twice before, wall shook her: she persuaded shaking, would soon carried quite away. She screamed Oliver come save her. She must called loud; Ailwin, George her arms, staircase moment. There scuffle raft. It seemed Oliver paddling one hand, keeping Roger other. It terrible see them,--it like fighting, dangerous place. There splash. Mildred's eyes grew dim moment, she could see nothing: she heard Ailwin's voice,--very joyful,--calling Oliver,-- "Well done, Oliver! Well rid him! Pull away him, Oliver! He full able take care himself, depend upon it. He never made drowned. Come help Mildred, there is dear! Never mind Roger." Mildred soon saw raft approaching her, Oliver alone upon it. "Oh! Oliver, he? What done?" cried Mildred, her brother arrived wall. Oliver hot, his lips quivered he answered,-- "I do not know I done. I could help it. He wanted come screamed. He wanted catch chest instead. I tripped up--off water. He swim. But tub--give hold rope--quick! I send stream. He may meet it." Down went gathered apples water, within wall, went tub outside. Oliver fastened line round heavy stone wall. "I wish I never screamed!" exclaimed Mildred. "I sure I wish too. You _must_ leave screaming so, Mildred. I sure I thought water, middle splash, I hurry. If Roger drowned, doing, screaming so." Mildred scream now; she cried bitterly. It soon seen, however, Roger safe. He swimming still water opposite side, presently landed beside pony cow. He left wringing wet his hair clothes, shake his fists Oliver threatening way. "Oh, look him! He kill you!" cried Mildred. "I never scream again." "Never mind, long he safe," said Oliver. "I do not care his shaking his fists. It business save you, caring him, chests Levels. Never mind now, dear. You will not scream without occasion, I know. What made so? You cannot think shriek was. It went head." "Part wall fell; whole shakes so, I sure presently. I wish home. But shall ever Roger? He kill you, go near him: he cannot stay there." "Leave Roger me," said Oliver, feeling secretly his sister's fear consequences passed. He stepped wall, convinced shaking,--almost rocking. He declared quite unsafe, he must look remaining walls slept another night building. Mildred must get upon raft immediately. What heap blue cloth? Mildred explained, cloth declared valuable left behind. Two pairs hands availed pull end stuck water, children found possession whole piece home-spun. "May use it? We make it, buy it," said Mildred. "I thought too," replied her brother. "We see that. It business save it, rate; help it. How heavy water!" They pulled dozen apples, rowed away home prize. Ailwin said, she met stairs, she glad enough see home again; especially without Roger. "Roger must fetched, however," said Oliver, "and sooner better." "Oh yet!" pleaded Mildred. "He angry!" "That thing," said Oliver. "I want show I tripped over, anger, I could help it. He never believe malice, beginning end, I go directly." "But he thrash you. You know he can. He ever much stronger you; he passion, I know he may do." "What I do?" said Oliver. "I cannot leave there, standing dripping wet, cow pony." "Would use I go you, say fault?" asked Mildred, trembling. "No, no; must go." "I would go, water between, Mildred would take care baby," said Ailwin. "Oh do,--do go! You strong!" said children. "Why, see, I cannot abide going water, way, never could: without much boat." "But I row carefully," said Oliver, "as safely boat. You see often crossed, easy is. You cannot think care I take you, go." "Then there is coming back," objected Ailwin. "If I board raft Roger, shall go bottom, that is certain!" "How often I bottom? And yet I raft Roger, ever since made." "Well, think near Mildred going bottom, now. I declare I thought seen last her." "Roger nothing that, know well. But I tell manage. You carry pail over, and,--(never mind early)--you milking cow I bring Roger here; I come back you. That do,--will not it? Come,-- fetch pail. Depend upon best plan." Mildred remembered, great fear, plan Roger would left her George Oliver went fetch Ailwin home: she say word, feeling she caused mischief ought object Oliver's plan getting scrape. She need feared Oliver would neglect her feelings. Just he put Ailwin her milk-pail, he said his sister-- "I shall try set Roger somewhere, he cannot plague George; better bolt room up-stairs see us coming; account open door till I bid you." Mildred promised, sat George asleep her lap, watch event. She saw Ailwin make odd gestures she stood raft, balancing herself she thought boards would gape her feet. Oliver paddled diligently, looking behind oftener oftener, he drew near landing-place, learn Roger meant came within his reach. The moment boys within arm's length other, Roger sprang furiously upon Oliver, would thrown instant, Oliver expected this, upon his guard. Oliver managed jump ashore; boys fought fiercely. There could doubt beginning would beaten,--Roger much taller stronger two, much less peaceable his habits Oliver: yet Oliver made good fight time, he knocked completely. Roger give his fallen enemy kick stomach, Ailwin seized him, said she going see her young master killed her face, boy devil, whichever Roger might be. She tripped up; Oliver risen, Roger lay sprawling, Ailwin kneeling upon keep down. Roger shouted two one,--cowards, fight two one! "I sorry be," said Oliver, dashing away blood streamed his nose. "I wish I old tall you: I not. And fighting play, would signify I beaten every day week. Here Mildred baby; I take care till know become father mother: try prevent me, I get Ailwin, anybody thing I can, help me, sooner shall hurt. If father mother ever come back take care Mildred, I fight every day till I beat you, let nobody interfere: till then, I go Mildred often she calls, drown it, I showed morning." Roger answered fresh kicks struggles. Ailwin said aloud she saw nothing leaving spit land, starve dunghill. There would taking house temper. Roger vowed he would drown little pigs, hough cow. He done thing before; he would again; drop milk George. "That never do," said Oliver. "Ailwin, think could get Red-hill? He would plenty eat there, might he pleased, way cow's. I could carry his dog." Ailwin asked Oliver bring her cord raft, two could tie boy mischief. Oliver brought cord, he could bear think using so. "Come, now, Roger," said he, "you picked quarrel; may get moment. We do not want quarrel time this. Never mind happened. Only say will not meddle others flood lasts; shall help row home, I thank you. After all, fight day, like." More kicks Roger. No answer. So Oliver Ailwin tied his arms legs cord; Ailwin proceeded milk cow, Oliver, washing his face, give pony hay, see little pigs went on. The animals drooping, especially cow. Oliver wished given pigs her milk, poor sow seemed weak ill; cow gave little milk afternoon, none spare. Her legs trembled she stood milked; she lay again, soon Ailwin done. "The poor thing are not long world," said Ailwin. "Depend upon boy bewitched her. I do not believe she trembles way he side water." "You see morning," said Oliver. "Shall take raft now? I do not like carry tied so, fear he throw about, roll water. He would certainly drowned." "Leave him, Oliver: take word it, boy never made drowned." "You thought Stephen, know; he drowned, I afraid." "Neither I know that. I believe I see it," said Ailwin wise look. It Roger's mood lie like one dead. He move muscle he lifted, laid raft. Ailwin delighted see boy she afraid thus humbled, she could help giving his face splash rub muddy water stream he lay. "Ailwin, shame!" cried Oliver. "I fight next, so. You know durst not, his hands free." "To sure, Oliver, reason. One must take one's revenge one can. However, I will not notice till do." "Cannot set pail, help row?" asked Oliver. He quite tired. The raft heavy now; his nose left bleeding, his head ached sadly. Three pulls Ailwin brought nearer home Oliver's previous efforts. He observed must get round house, possible, stream ran garden, land Roger Red-hill. There much difficulty getting round, everything like fence long swept away. As passed near entrance-door garden, observed waters still sinking. They stood half-way door-posts. Oliver declared he little less tired, he would go lower rooms tub, see whether he could pick anything useful. He feared, however, almost everything must swept windows, water-falls Mildred thought pretty, first day flood. "There chest!" exclaimed Oliver, pointing little creek stout chest stuck. "Roger, I believe chest ... began quarrel about. Come, now, sign ought make up?" Roger would appear hear: his companions made short work it. They pulled shore Red-hill, laid Roger slimy bank:--for saw occasion carry one heavy sulky nice bed grass spread top red precipice waters cut Oliver knew knife Roger's pocket. He took out, cut cord tied his wrists, threw knife little distance, Roger could easily reach order free his legs; time overtake put again. Roger made one catch Oliver's leg, missing it, lay dead; Ailwin believed he yet stirred raft rounded house again, great chest tow. Mildred delighted see back, especially without Roger. She thought Oliver's face looked shocking, Oliver would say word this, anything else, till he found Roger's dog, gone basket, set ashore his master. "There!" said he, he stepped window accomplished, "we done business. There are, desert island, before. Now need think them, attend affairs." "Your face, Oliver! Pray do--" "Never mind face, dear, frighten poor Geordie. How poor Geordie?" "I think he better. I never saw fretful, hot ill. And he cries dreadfully!" CHAPTER EIGHT. NEW QUARTERS. Ailwin presently made George's supper, milk, little thickened meal. They child, watching he would take it, loud crack heard. "What that?" cried Oliver. "It crack," said Ailwin, "in wall somewhere. I heard one Mildred gone play, dinner." "And another away," said Mildred. "Some plaster fell time:--look here! In corner.--What matter, Oliver? What makes look frightened? What mean?" "It means, I afraid, house coming down. Look great zigzag crack wall!--and loose plaster hangs part ceiling! I really think,--I quite sure, ought stay longer." "But go? What shall do?" "We must think that, lose time. I think room fall soon." Mildred could help crying, saying could settle themselves, rest all. She never saw anything like it. They tired know do; work hard ever. She never saw anything like it. "No, dear, never," said her brother: "and thousands people, far older you, never saw anything like flood. But know, Mildred, must die, help it." This reminded Mildred set heavy tasks,--that bade thus labour preserve lives He gave. She silent. Oliver went on-- "If ever meet father mother again, shall mind ever much tired now. We shall like telling plans doings, please God ever sit fire-side." "Or whenever meet heaven, alive now," said Mildred. "Yes, dear; talk get Red-hill:--we must talk now, set work. However, I really think, Mildred, father mother still alive somewhere. I feel were." "But Red-hill," said Mildred, "what mean Red-hill? We going there, Roger is,--are we?" "We must, dear. There place. Roger unkind: floods falling houses unkinder still. Come, Ailwin, help raft. We must carry away dark. There house standing to-morrow morning, I afraid." "Sleep ground!" exclaimed Ailwin. "Without roof cover us! My poor grandfather little thought I ever come that." "If move beds, need sleep bare ground," said Oliver. "Now, Ailwin, do not begin cry. Pray do not. You grown-up woman, Mildred I children. You ought take care us, instead beginning cry." "That pretty true," said Ailwin: "but I little thought ever sleep without roof head." "Come, come, trees," said Oliver. "They something roof, leaves on." "And cloth," said Mildred; "that immensely long piece cloth. Would make tent, somehow?" "Capital!" cried Oliver. "How well shall cloth tent! It seems cloth sent purpose. It spoiled already, hardly harm. And I sure person wove would glad cover heads to-night. I shall carry across anything else--this minute. I run bring raft round door below. The water low enough get way.--Oh dear! I wish I tired! I hardly move. But I must forget that; stay here." While he gone, Mildred asked Ailwin whether she tired. "Pretty much; bad he," replied Ailwin. "Then think I could fetch good many things, he watches Geordie grass? If thought could row raft, I sure I could carry great many things down-stairs, land hill." Ailwin doubt she could row, narrow gentle stream ran garden. She made trial first Oliver board, several times Mildred, succeeding always well. Oliver extremely glad this; bridge-basket used much, sometimes heavy weights, wearing out, might break moment. The bridge-rope, too, stoutest cord had, useful tying raft trunk beech, could carried away. When rope well fastened, Oliver content rest grass beside Geordie, let strong Ailwin little Mildred work wished. It surprised him, well he knew Ailwin, see loads she could carry, bringing good-sized mattress bank easily he could carried pillow. She wrung wet long piece home-spun, spread sun, dry much could dark, seemed think Mildred washing her doll's petticoat. Mildred took charge lighter articles required care--her mother's china, one thing; found nothing made earthenware remained unbroken lower rooms. There pewter plates, lodged beech, together pots pans, knives forks, horn spoons. There table light enough moved, small one deal, Ailwin dragged water, legs broken: enough remained entire make preferable bare ground preparing food on, dry. There stool a-piece--not forgetting one Roger; Mildred took care Geordie his little chair. Not even Ailwin could carry chest drawers: she carried separate drawers, clothes family them. No one household ever seen carpet; matting floors. Ailwin pulled pieces this, protection damp insects ground. "It wet water now," said she; "but must quarrel anything to-day account; matting dry hill better home. If turns rotten, must try spare piece cloth overhead, lay underfoot: George feel like home, he bit matting trip his little foot against." So down-stairs went great bundle wet matting. "Will to-night?" asked Oliver, languidly, he saw Ailwin preparing put again, sun touching western hills. "You know put tent, get something eat go sleep; long, long day!" "As please," said Ailwin; "but said house would night; many things yet sorry without." "Never mind them:--let go, I sure want asleep anything else." "Sleep, indeed! Do suppose I shall sleep boy hid among trees? Not I, may rely upon it. Those may can: I watch." No one yet mentioned Roger, though felt his presence terrible drawback comfort establishment hill, might otherwise be, fine weather, tolerably pleasant one. It made Oliver indignant think stout lad, wished make welcome had, common adversity, skulking wood enemy, instead helping labours, circumstances friends. This thought made Oliver angry he choose speak Roger. When Ailwin offered seek out, her best tie his limbs again, carry away place children chose, Oliver begged her say it; observed better forget Roger altogether, could, unless he come make peace. There one, however, could moment forget late quarrel. Mildred unhappy thought mischief she done her shriek. Not her hard toil evening could console her. When cloth spread lower branches great ash, shelter party, careless way, one night (when time make proper tent), Ailwin heating something supper, Oliver dozing George one beds, Mildred stole away, consider whether anything she could cure Roger's anger. It her good, least, sit think it. She sat tree, bee-she would stood. The moon risen, bright, near full. The clouds seemed come sky, rest upon earth; white vapours, looking soft wreaths snow, hovering wide waste waters. Some gently floating curling, others brooded still, like large white birds hidden nests. It seemed Mildred's eye, however, clear path cut mists, Red-hill moon horizon, path strewed quivering moonbeams. She forgot, gazing, she looking upon carr,--upon muddy waters covered ruins many houses, hidden bodies drowned animals, perhaps people. She looked upon train trembling light, felt beautiful was, He whose hand kindled mild heavenly lamp, poured rays his children's eyes, would never forget forsake them. While everything made beautiful seem ordered pleasure men, lives common comforts could overlooked. So plain appear Mildred, she felt less less anxious fearful; and, time, she afraid nothing all, could never afraid again. She determined go seek Roger,--not wish like Ailwin's, he could bound force, carried away, alone miserable,--but much happier hope purpose. She think he would hurt her; but, he did, she rather he strike her Oliver he fight, day day, Ailwin whispered her meant do. She believe he could come blows Oliver again, she taken blame upon herself. So she set forth so. She went quickly enough she upon slope, full moonlight, blaze Ailwin's fire far her right hand. But she felt difference she entered shade trees. It rather chilly there, silent. There rustle grass brambles her feet, she disturbed small animals hidden there. When she thought she far enough away her party heard them, she began call softly, hoping Roger might presently answer, she go much darkness. But she heard nothing her voice, she called, "Roger! Where you, Roger? I want speak you." Further she went; still reply. Though she knew every inch her way, she tripped several times roots trees; she fell. She saw stars spaces wood, she looked up, knew she soon come upon grass again. But she so, she found almost dark wood, though moon shone waters afar. She still went calling Roger--now little louder, till she stumbled something root tree, warm, growled. "Bishop!" she exclaimed, alarm; next Roger, she always afraid Roger's dog. "Why do not call Spy?" said Roger's voice, ground her. "What business call his wrong name?--how he ever learn his name people come calling wrong one? Get away--will you? I know I will come here, spoiling dog." "I go back directly I said one thing. It fault Oliver quarrelled morning. I frightened, screamed I ought not; fault fire, getting supper us, tent. I sure, I wish there." "Very fine," said Roger. "He knows I thrashed him; he want it. But I will thrash long I live; I tell that." "Oliver know coming--he asleep tent," protested Mildred. "Nobody knows coming. I do not believe Oliver would let come, he known it. Only go look yourself; see he lies asleep grass. We know beat fighting, much bigger; I cannot bear he fight. It time; I know he never give up; I do not know long he big enough thrash you." "Long enough, I tell you: get away, let go sleep; I will thrash too." "How talk so, Roger, keep anger so, unhappy? I wonder much before, Ailwin help Oliver... That enough make anybody angry. But now, I come tell sorry I am, I know, I ask Oliver, he glad forget everything, come supper us, instead lying dark, nothing eat, I think ought forgive forget; forgive me, forget thrashing Oliver." Roger made answer. "Good-bye, Roger," said Mildred. "I sorry choose lie here, hungry cold, instead of..." "What business island?" interrupted Roger, fiercely. "How dared settle upon ground, mock fire supper? I will fire supper too." "I hope will, come ours. We obliged settle here--the house cracking, falling pieces. We sorry come,--we tired;--but dared stay house." Roger uttered exclamation showed new light broken upon him, causes removal. "Poor Geordie ill, sorry move him. The time come, Roger, though do not think now, vexed cannot tell whether father mother alive dead, whether George live die, put pain quarrels upon us too." "Well, get gone now!" said Roger, immediately discovering she paces her way home he said much. Mildred heard Ailwin calling her supper, she drew near tent. She say she been; perhaps she watch, consequence passed. She soon saw Roger sauntering trees; indeed she said, he saw together, altered Roger's mind. He hungry, tired alone sulky. He thinking comfortable fire steaming kettle looked, considering he make his approach, Mildred jumped up, came running him. "They do not know I came find you," said she. "Oliver think kind come friends! He pleased! And plenty supper everybody." She ventured put her hand his, lead forwards light. She told Oliver Roger willing forgive forget; Oliver said he quite willing too. Oliver set stool Roger, offered his basin broth. Ailwin held her tongue;--which could expected her. Roger quite know say do, he finished his supper, fed Spy. He swung his legs, he sat upon his stool, stared fire, began whistle. Roger's shrillest whistle, sometimes heard carr, anything agreeable: his low whistle, he thinking it, soft sweet. A gentle chuckle soon heard George, he lay across Mildred's knees. "He likes it! He likes whistle that!" exclaimed Mildred. Her eyes said Roger, "Do go on!" Roger went whistling, better better,--more softly, he drawing nearer, till he quite bent poor sick child, who, many signs pleasure, dropped sleep,--a quiet, sound sleep. "Thank you!" said Oliver, heartily. "Thank you, Roger!" "You to-morrow, you, he fretful?" said Mildred. Roger nodded. Then he made cloth drapery hang better pillows child laid,--so keep dew completely, he said. Then he nodded again, Oliver gave blanket: he nodded good night, he rolled neighbouring tree. CHAPTER NINE. ONE PRISONER RELEASED. In morning, appeared right remove Red-hill night before. Only fragments roof house remained. Some beams quantity rubbish fallen room party lived since flood came; heap rubbish lay spot Mildred would sleeping stayed. All saw considered awe. Roger looked first little girl, part ruin, imagining would her lying there, wondering see her standing here, alive unhurt. "Look wall stands out;" said Oliver. "The faster house falls, haste must make save can." "Oh! Cannot stay quietly to-day?" asked Mildred. "I think got really want; bustle hurry hard work every day tiresome! Cannot keep still rest to-day?" "To-morrow, dear," replied her brother. "To-morrow Sunday! And try rest. But knowing long may live place, middle waters; duty save everything I make George rest us comfortable colder weather comes on." "I wonder world about, nobody comes see us," said Mildred, sighing. "Out sight, mind, Mildred," said Ailwin. "That way, world over." "I sure not," said Oliver. "Mildred I say little father mother, do not imagine thing minds. I know Mildred never shuts her eyes, she sees mill floating away, evening, father standing..." He could go that. Presently he said, "When flood came, I suppose, boats had. It would take first day bring distance, get afloat. Then people would look round (as ought do) see could good. Nobody looked glass way, since day yesterday, saw rafters sticking air,--the house ruins is,--would suppose one could left alive here. From distance, hardly fancy even little mouse could help either drowned starved. This last spot Levels boat come to.--You see, Mildred, Red-hill, though everything us, speck compared grounds stood water since waters began sink. We better think anything living can, unless please God die." Roger want hear anything kind; he went George lying, began whistle softly him. The child altered his mother would hardly known him: he smiled he heard whistle; smile his own. He put his hand patted Roger's face, even pulled his hair good stout pull. Roger used nurse his dog, though little children. He took George his arms, laid comfortably across his knees, he whistled till little fellow looked full his face, puckered his poor white lips, he would whistle too. This made Roger laugh aloud; George laughed. Ailwin heard them, peeped corner tent were. She flew Oliver, tell Roger his tricks worse ever,--he bewitching baby. She angry Oliver telling his sister, he looked too, might glad them, bewitch poor baby manner, he crying sadly yesterday. Mildred, her part, ran thank Roger, say glad she able whistle he could. "How you?" said Roger,--"you never dog, caught sort bird life, I dare say." "No, I never could. One day, long ago, mother busy, I tired playing, she gave salt hand, told I might put upon birds' tails garden, catch them: I get one. At last, half salt spilt, half melted hand; dinner ready. I suppose joke mother's." "She wanted way; fool must find out! Why, birds could sillier, let put salt upon tails." "It long ago," pleaded Mildred. "Here, take him," said Roger, popping George her arms. "Show catch birds like. I cannot spend time longer here." "How he cries you!" exclaimed Mildred. It first time Roger ever known anybody sorry his going away. The child certainly crying him. He half turned back, turned again, saying-- "Cannot tell I come by-and-by? I must now." The truth was, Roger never forgotten chest--the oaken chest looked tempting he saw floating down, Oliver would stop catch it,--the stout chest he knew safe sound somewhere house, unless harm happened night. Oliver agreed importance bring chest shore: boys lost time it. Mildred came George watch proceedings, found Oliver already made one trip, brought articles use value. He came his sister, something he held carefully covered hands. He said gravely-- "Here, dear, put safe place,--where one know me." "A watch!--mother's watch!" "I found it, several things her cupboard, thrown wall breaking." "It seem hurt," observed Mildred. "And often wished watch!" "I think I shall never wish anything again," said Oliver. Mildred saw his face he turned away, began consider she could put watch, might safe, Roger might see it, Oliver reminded it. Ailwin Roger meantime disputing raft first,--Roger wanting secure chest, Ailwin insisting high time cow milked. Oliver said he master his father's absence, he would quarrels. All three go raft. Roger landed staircase, he could collecting he wanted bring over, Oliver proceeded set Ailwin ashore beside cow. By working number three, harmony, far would gained using strength fighting disputing. He care many times he crossed water day, he rowed would keep peace. He would willingly servant rowing, though he chose master deciding. Ailwin stared Oliver. It struck her, Mildred too, Oliver seemed grown many years older since flood came. He taller, stronger;--indeed he seemed to-day growing weaker fatigue; he timid boy he always appeared before. He spoke like man; spirit man his eyes. It singular instance. There cases timid boy made man of, sudden, protect, danger sorrow, weaker himself. Roger felt something truth; much making quiet tractable to-day his interest George, his liking live tent companions, rather open air alone. Ailwin short time gone. She came bank Mildred, swinging her empty milk-pail, sobbing, bottom her heart. Mildred think she ever seen Ailwin cry before; she could imagine nothing Oliver lost. She turned giddy moment she could see Ailwin, sick she could speak her. "So heard, Mildred,--you heard, I see white. Oliver says she dead ever many hours. I say, gone first thing, instead staring poking yon tumble-down house, might saved her. I shall never milk her again,--not drop!--nor either, far I see; saying shall ever get away. Here I drop milk give you, dear, though white wall." "Never mind," gasped Mildred, "if cow. I thought Oliver." "Oliver! Bless heart! There he busy house things, nothing happened; provoking caring nothing poor cow. There she lies, poor soul! Dead cold, half water, half out. She worth two put together, things,--I tell that." "Indeed I sorry," said Mildred; she saw George pulling empty can, she melted tears, would come faster faster till Oliver stood her side. She tried tell she afraid of, she thought she cried that;--or, least, much; she really could explain she felt, her sobs came thick. "I know exactly mean, dear," said Oliver; "but I understand must crying cow. I sorry,-- very. I rather lost anything left cow, George ill."--Here he bit his lip, looked away George, lest he cry like his sister. He went on, however, talking rather quickly first, becoming composed he proceeded. He said, "I thinking never us may near losing everything have, lives, all, grieve separate loss happens. When said prayers first night flood..." "How long ago seem!" exclaimed Mildred. "It does, indeed!" replied Oliver, glad hear her say something distinctly. "When said prayers night, whenever said since, begged might able bear dying flood,--to bear whatever pleased God do. Now, right way make minds everything, way pleases God. Let us try bear cheerfully, whether lose cow anything else first; whether die together. That way, Mildred!--And I die together, must way too." "I hope shall though." "I think likely; long. And useless unhappy anything lose here! People may near death need anxious that, like seem long live. So come, dear, see chest; help us settle done it." There nothing outside chest show whose might be. Everybody agreed ought opened immediately, lest contained spoiled wet. But open question; stout lock, strong hinges. After many attempts, found nothing short proper tools would answer purpose: Oliver went see his could reached. Through piles rubbish, puddle slimy water, he got spot he left them,--hidden behind straw, Redfurns might discover spoil them. The straw washed away, his beautiful lump alabaster reduced slime; his tools there,--in bright condition, safe. He hastened away spot; thoughts crowded upon his mind day he last used tools, way life he Mildred happy, seemed ever. He thought beautiful stone carvings doorway, Pastor Dendel said them. They fallen; knew become kind Pastor Dendel? The garden, fresh green gay blossoms, muddy stream; rank smells thick mists came meadows corn-fields; his father, whose manly voice daily heard singing mill, he? It would stay thinking things; Oliver hastened back his tools, heavy kitchen hammer, he also found. None would open chest. The party managed last heating large nail, drew shattered door-post, burning holes wood chest, close nails fastened hinges, loosen them, make drop out. The lid raised, great variety articles found within, nicely packed wet penetrated little way. Mildred looked thoughtfully; she saw Oliver paused contents lay open view. She looked her brother's face, said-- "I wonder chest belonged to?" "I thinking so," observed Oliver. "Never mind that," said Ailwin. "We may know, day other, may not. Meantime, ours. Come, make haste, see wrap poor baby in, cold nights." "We look something sort,--I sure might use thing that," said Oliver: "but..." "But," said Mildred, "I do not think things ours, ever were. Nobody ever gave us. They belonged somebody else;--to somebody may wondering moment are." "Nonsense, Mildred!" exclaimed Ailwin. "Who gave harness braces raft, meal living two days, I wonder: know somebody hungry, longing it, minute?" "I wish it, then," replied Mildred. "But, Oliver, wrong use meal? I never thought that." "Nor I: I think right enough there. The meal would spoiled presently; meal (and harness too) sort thing pay for, make way, ever meet people lost chest." "And George, us, might starved without it." "Yes: must take want eat, comes way, nobody ask leave of: and, ever get place, inquire lost meal-chest set harness, offer pay took. But I think different things." "So I," said Mildred. "Those table-cloths, embroidered cap,--somebody taken pains make them, might like sell them. And look! Look Roger! He pulled great heavy bag money." "Now, Roger, put bag found it," said Oliver. "It none yours." "How I know I shall find again, next time I look?" replied Roger, walking bag. Mildred afraid Oliver's following him, another quarrel happening. She put her arm within her brother's, he could easily guess why. "Do not afraid, dear," he said. "If Roger chooses dishonest thing, his affair. We warned him; it. We must honest ourselves,--that all." "Then I think better look chest," said Mildred; "only find something warm wrap Geordie in. The clothes look nice--we might fancy wanted things well without." "I much afraid that," replied her brother: "and would pity things spoil damp. They would dry hour warm sun; could pack away night." "Roger never let that," declared Ailwin. "Not rag he leave anybody do not stow away he sight. Never I see perverse children you, thankless God's gifts. I ashamed grateful He puts hands." Mildred looked her brother different face. She perplexed alarmed; she saw Oliver not. "Roger cannot carry anything," he replied. "He may bury hide he pleases; somewhere Red-hill; tell anybody comes fetch us whatever know goods." "Nobody ever come fetch us off," said Ailwin, beginning cry. "The people distance do not care straw becomes us; children hand perverse troublesome, I do not know bear life you." "If nobody comes save us," said Oliver, calmly, "I see good money fine clothes Roger you." "Roger me! Pray mean that?" "I mean he taking things belong us; Mildred I it. Only tell one thing, Ailwin. Do believe cloak stockings sent Nan Redfurn's way, she might take them? And think would perverse her run away them?" "Now, Oliver, nonsense talk! As I wanted rag things wear! As I would touch penny honestly got!" "So I always thought before; I shall think now, help Mildred dry whatever damp, pack away safely--all things may poor Geordie good." Roger long finding hole tree he could hide his bag money. He cut small cross bark he might know tree again, hastened back, see else he could secure. He found plenty pretty things hanging bushes, wait quite dry dress he never dressed before. With embroidered cap mentioned his head, scarlet waistcoat, worked silver thread, hanging loose his body, light blue coat, whose skirts reached his heels, he looked little like dirty ragged Roger, Geordie shrank back him, first sight, smile till he heard soft whistle again. After that, he seemed pleased finery rest party together. Ailwin glanced scornfully upon it, she disapproved beginning touched; Oliver Mildred looked grave. So much pleased Geordie gay waistcoat, Roger took his arms, he might able stroke it, play silver flowers. It little fatigue, now, except spirits, nurse poor George. He shrunk skin bone, light startle accustomed lift him. It grievous, however, look ghastly stretched features, flabby tremulous little arms, suffering expression countenance. To hear his feeble cry worse still. Oliver really glad take Mildred away seeing hearing him, long child would quiet Roger: he asked her filter water gravel. He begged her get ready great deal--enough drink, bathe George in; water becoming worse quality every day. It unsafe even live near; much drink. So he scraped quantity clean dry gravel ledges precipice first flood thrown it, helped Mildred press gravel worn old basket. This basket set across tub, first thoroughly cleaned. Mildred poured water upon gravel degrees; astonishing much purer better came tub went basket. When tub full, Ailwin heated water presently her large fire, made warm bath child. Roger unwilling give bath ready, new pleasant he find liked loved anybody--to power one, much easy delightful exercise force. But, bath ready, must left cool, Oliver beckoned away particular business. This business indeed pressing. All party complained bad smells Red-hill became really oppressive. They know great danger falling ill fever, consequence; every one felt languid uncomfortable. Oliver made circuit hill, discover whether evil could removed. He surprised find number dead animals lying holes corners, well heap Roger's game, actually putrefying sun. There also dead horse thrown up, side quarry was; horse swarms flies Oliver never seen. It consult pushing back horse stream, clearing away dead things could find, Oliver called Roger. Roger struck he observed. He saw difficulty clearing away game he ought never left lying heap sun. He believed, too, stout poles he Oliver could shove horse water; and, line tied head, tow still water current yet ran quarry. But troubled was, evidently mortality among animals hill. They dying directions; want proper food, put usual habits: others preyed upon stronger neighbours. Nothing seemed thrive ravenous birds came clusters, winging way waters, making great rustling pinions descended perch upon dead animal, pulling pieces eyes boys, stood consulting do. It horrid sight: brought horrid thought soon probably would game left food party; meantime might unwholesome. Oliver never imagined bold boy, Roger Redfurn, could look alarmed he moment. "Never mind, now, Roger," said he, "what likely become me. Wait, find by-and-by. What I afraid seeing Mildred look George now. Come, let us set work! Do not stand looking sky, way. Help me--do. Cannot Spy help? Call him; you?" "We cannot get away!" exclaimed Roger, now, first time, awakened his situation. "Those vile birds--they go like--nasty creatures--and cannot stir are!" "I wish singing birds back again, instead creatures," said Oliver. "Our shy, pretty, innocent little birds, used pleased pick twigs straws build nests with, satisfied worms slugs flies cleared away garden. I wish them, instead ugly, saucy, dirty birds. But birds happier somewhere else, I dare say; dry, pleasant place among hills, sweet flowers, cool clear running water." "They get there, cannot. We cannot get hot steaming place: hills look every day. I wish uncle dead he brought us moors last time. I wish he had, I know. If I moor now, plovers..." "Come, come; forget now, set work," interrupted Oliver. "If will not call Spy help, I see whether he mind me." Spy came, hesitation, answer whistle like his master's, exactly same. His master soon set work, began work himself, sort desperation. It astonishing clearance made short time. But good expected. There much vegetable decay region round, floating dead animals distance caused partial relief. While boys hard work disagreeable task, Mildred enjoying seeing George his warm bath. Ailwin held there, Mildred continued her useful business filtering water, talking child while. The poor little fellow soon left crying, moved his weak limbs tepid water, trying splash Ailwin, he will not splash his mother play, every morning she washed dressed him. "I sure great deal good," exclaimed Mildred. "I filter quantities water; he shall bath often ever good him. Suppose make well!" Ailwin shook her head. She saw impossible would even keep healthy child well absence proper food, unwholesome atmosphere, without sufficient shelter changes weather might come hour, must come soon. How unlikely sick baby recover circumstances, she well aware. Yet she little thought near end was. After his bath, Geordie lay, nicely covered up, mattress tent. One his nurses visited, every minutes; satisfied he comfortably asleep. The boys came dinner, last; Oliver went wash his hands clean water, Roger stooped child kiss him. Before so, however, he started back, asked Ailwin baby's eyes looked strangely. They half closed, seemed like neither sleep waking. Ailwin sat mattress, took her arms, Mildred ran call Oliver. The poor child stretched stiff across Ailwin's knees, breathed more. When Oliver Mildred came running back, Ailwin putting her cheek near child's mouth, feel indeed breath. She shook her head, her eyes ran tears. Oliver kneeled down, put his hand heart--it beat. He lifted wasted arm--it fell, never life it. There lay little body, still unmoved, face composed,--the eyes dim half closed, ear hearing nothing, tongue silent, calling little George say something he fond saying, hearken something he loved hear, and--all vain. "Whistle him, Roger!" exclaimed Mildred, her trembling. "Try he cannot hear that. Whistle softly." Roger tried; notice taken forced, irregular whistle best he could give moment. "Listen, dear! Hark, George! Only hear!" exclaimed Mildred Ailwin. "O hush! All you!" exclaimed Oliver. "Be quiet, Mildred dear! Our little brother dead." Roger threw grass, hid his face his arms. He moaned rocked about, that, even first moments grief, brother sister looked awe. "Come away me, dear," whispered Oliver his sister. "Ailwin, give George me. Let arms." "Bless you, dears; George longer. It poor little dead body. You must call George." "Give me," said Oliver. He took body Ailwin's arms, carrying gently anything could hurt now; he Mildred walked away towards spot bee-she would stood. Ailwin gazed them, dashing away tears back her hand, gathered she could see. Oliver Mildred walked till could descend bank little, sit, waters, knew sight everybody. This bank presented strange appearance, children wondering days, till Ailwin remembered she often heard say thick forest growing Levels spread, old trees were, every one, somehow underground. It appeared true. As earth washed away channel, cut along bank, large trunks trees seen lying along, black coal. Some others started bank; roots spread like network, holding soil together, keeping bank firm part. Upon one trunks, jutted out, Oliver took his seat; Mildred placed herself beside him. "Let lie knee now," said she. "Presently," said Oliver. "How easy quiet he looks!" "And quietly he died!" observed Mildred. "I think easy thing die,--or half easy us bear see." "The hard part come, dear. We glad see his pain--so comfortable he looks moment. The hard part hear his little voice more--never ... But must think now. I hope, Mildred, sorry George dead. I not, I think he may father mother already." "Already?" "Yes--if dead. Perhaps pitying poor baby time he ill, crying moaning sadly; he may them, quite happy, full joy meet again." "Then may seeing us now." "Yes; forget us, even first moment George's little spirit them. Do let see us sad, Mildred. Let see glad George, could nothing him." "But shall miss ... Oliver! He must buried!" "Yes. When done, shall miss sadly. We must expect that. But must bear it." "If die here," said Mildred, "it easy without, little while. But ever get away, grow old father mother, shall do, years, without hearing Geordie laugh, wake us morning? What long things people's lives are! It seem would never done, wait time see Geordie again." "I wish dead!" sighed Oliver. "I sure, I. And dying easy!" "The pastor always said nothing afraid of," said Oliver--"I mean, innocent people. And Geordie innocent, he fit go directly God." "If die here," said Mildred, "Roger must too. What matter now, think? Was he thinking that?" "He miserable something. Oh, Mildred, look! Did ever see Geordie look sweeter? Yes, may now." And Oliver quietly laid child Mildred's arms. "Yet," said he, sighing, "we must bury him." "Oh, when?" asked Mildred. "Better his face looks now. To-morrow Sunday. We work to-morrow, bury Geordie." "Where? How?" "We choose prettiest place find, quietest." "I wish pastor here," said Mildred. "I never saw funeral, except passing one road sometimes." "We need afraid wrong funeral, dear. We must make kind little coffin; Roger help dig grave, pastor say prayers, I know hearts shall thanking God taking little brother safe happy him." "And I may plant flowers upon his grave, may I? And bring bees humming it. How fond he going near hives, hear bees hum! Where shall his grave be?" "Under one trees, one shadiest." "Oh, dear--here comes Ailwin! I wish she would let us alone." Ailwin crying much speak. She took body Mildred's arms gentle force, kissing little girl she so. She covered baby's face her apron she walked away. The children went among trees fix spot grave. They found one liked; suddenly remembered ground hard, spade, tool could make deep hole. Oliver greatly disturbed this,--more he chose show he saw troubled his sister also was. After thinking time purpose,--feeling he could bear commit body foul flood, remembering horror many animals scratching earth Red-hill, ground hard, many odious birds prey hovering air, hours,--after thinking things heavy heart, he begged Mildred go home Ailwin, ask Roger come wood, consult must done. Mildred readily went: she hardly liked speak Roger she saw him. He watching, sulky air, Ailwin doing, she bent mattress. His eyes red crying; he seem gentle that. When Mildred given her message, he moved he thought great trouble go; Mildred suspected indeed truth,--that he unhappy child's death, ashamed appearing so, put gruff manner hide it. Seeing this, little girl ran him, he sauntered away, put her hand his, said,-- "Do help Oliver can. I know he would tried help George little brother." "It Is he been," muttered Roger. "I am sure I sorry." "Are you, indeed?" said Mildred, her eyes filling tears. Roger could bear see that; he hastened away. Mildred found great change she looked baby's face again. The eyes quite closed, Ailwin tied bandage round his head,--under chin, among thick hair used curl prettily, hung straight damp since he ill. He strangely dressed, laid straight stiff. He look like Geordie; Mildred began know dreary feelings death brings families. She longed Oliver come home; would gone see he about, she like leave tent body Ailwin busy elsewhere, case. When, length, boys returned, reported that, many reasons, could grave trees, would liked. They hopes making one would save body flood, would serve least till day (if day ever came) might removed churchyard. They tools dig deep hole with; hole, must deep: found could excavate space bank, trunk one large buried forest-trees. They could line hole hewn stones brought shattered wall house, could close also stone,--thus making space coffin grave, secure beast bird prey vault church-wall. Oliver found among ruins one beautiful carved stones he always admired surmounted doorway home. With he meant close little vault. At future time, one wish disturb remains, ivy might led face bank, sculptured stone; then, he thought, even loved little George could wish better grave. CHAPTER TEN. GRAVES IN THE LEVELS. Oliver much wished next day (Sunday, day his little brother's funeral) one rest decent quiet, he worked extremely hard, long light lasted, glad help rest party could give. To make excavation large enough body difficult task;-- earth soft, easily removed trunks, roots, branches buried trees, seemed run interior bank. But five stones grave lined considerable thickness; Oliver chose nicely fitted in, living creature able enter place sacred dead. How astonished find already place dead! While Ailwin holding one stones one end excavation, Oliver striking fixing great hammer, Roger emptying soil end. He exclaimed he come upon large thing made leather. "I dare say have," said Ailwin. "There manner things found dig Levels--except useful things, I mean. No one ever knew anything useful come odd places." "You wrong there," said Roger. "I got useful things carr, brought money fish fowl I ever took ponds it. Uncle I found old red earthenware things..." "Old red earthenware!" exclaimed Ailwin. "As old earthenware better fish fowl, much new now-a-days! My uncle sailor, always going Holland; he says quantity ware bring year hold victuals Lincolnshire. And Dutch ware cost half grandfather's time: do not telling wonderful tales, Roger. We shall not believe them." "Well, do not. But I say again, uncle Stephen I took gold old red ware got deep hole carr." "Very likely, indeed. I wonder gold throw away manner. However, I do not say may such. `Fools money soon parted,' folks say." "Who gave gold?" asked Oliver. "You may ask that," said Roger; "but may believe I tell you. You know Earl Arundel comes sometimes parts. Well,--it he." "When? Why?" "He often comes see Trent, care forests upon it: one time he stopped near here, his way Scotland, business. They say he castle full wonderful things somewhere." "What sort things?" asked Ailwin. "Horn spoons pewter drinking-mugs his old red earthenware?" "Perhaps," replied Roger, "But I heard nothing them. What I heard old bricks, stone figures, manner stone jars. Well, gentleman belonging Earl Arundel chanced come across us, found pitcher two moss; he made us go Earl..." "You do not mean ever saw lord speak to!" exclaimed Ailwin, turning sharp round upon Roger. "I tell I did, uncle too." Ailwin muttered she believe word it; her altered manner towards Roger moment, ever after, showed she did. "He asked us manner questions Levels," continued Roger:--"I mean things lie moss. He seem care settlers crops, otherwise way business. All he earthenware plainly his pleasure. He bought could find spot; he said found curiosities time, ... But I cannot stand talking more." And Roger glanced suspicious eyes piece leather (as he called it) he met bank Oliver. He wanted sole benefit new discovery. "And do, found anything more?" asked Ailwin. "One might easily bury ware uncle brings, keep moss till well wetted; earl might give one gold it. Come, Roger, tell findings. You owe tell me; considering people got away cloak warm stockings." "Look moss,--you better," said Roger. "You find nowhere." Not word would he say his concerns. Oliver want hear more. On told Earl Arundel's statues vases, he had, moment, longed see them, wondered whether alabaster cups collection; his thoughts presently George again. He remembered Mildred left long enough alone body; he dismissed Ailwin, saying he soon done, growing dark. As he worked silently thoughtfully, Roger supposed he observing nothing; therefore ventured, turning his back Oliver, investigate little closely leathern curiosity he met with. He disengaged earth more, drew something out, started he saw. "You _have_ found curiosity," observed Oliver, quietly. "That mummy." "No--it is man," exclaimed Roger, agitation. "At least something like man. Is like arm, hand end it?--a little dried, shrunk, ugly arm. It Is stiff, neither. Look! It cannot Uncle Stephen, sure--or Nan!" "No, no: mummy--a human body buried hundreds thousands years." Roger never heard mummy; great wonder that, even Oliver rightly know meaning word. All animal bodies (and human bodies) remain dry, means, instead putrefying, called mummies. "What mean hundreds thousands years?" said Roger. "Look here, arm bends, wrist! I believe I could make fingers close mine," he continued, stepping back--evidently afraid remains lay him. "If I sure now, Stephen Nan ... But peat water wonders, say, whatever lies it." "So does. It preserves bodies, I told you. I show minute nobody ever known." And Oliver took Roger's hand slip wood he working, began clear soil figure. "Do not, do not now!" exclaimed Roger. "Do not uncover face! If do, I go away." "Go, then," replied Oliver. It appeared bold boy timid one changed characters. The reason Roger disagreeable thoughts connected Stephen Nan Redfurn. He never forgot, images him, died midst angry contemptuous feelings him. Oliver, hand, religious. Though, easy times, afraid he ought dishonest violent persons, he yet enough trust God support his spirits his hope trial, seen: death grave, world, he believed dead went meet Maker Father, he fear all. Nothing Roger said, therefore, made desist, till he uncovered half dried body. "Look here!" said he--for Roger gone away he threatened--"come closer look, see nothing dusk. Did either Stephen Nan wear hair way? And dress anything like Ailwin's cloak? Look long black hair hanging round little flat brown face. And dress: skin beast, hair left on--a rough-edged skin, fastened bit something like coal left shoulder. I dare say wooden skewer. I wonder long ago body alive. I wonder sort country live in, day." Roger's fear departed, his habitual feelings prevailed. "I say," said he, returning spot, wrenching tool Oliver's hand; "I say--do not meddle more. The curiosity mine, know. I found it, it is mine." "What it?" asked Oliver, saw that, even now, Roger rather shrank touching limbs, turned away open eyes body. "It make show. If I do not happen see earl, get gold it, I will make people give penny piece see it; good gold presently." "I wish would bury it," earnestly exclaimed Oliver, thought occurred time might come, though perhaps hundreds years hence, dear little George's body might found like manner. He could endure idea body ever made show of. Of course, Roger would hear giving his treasure; Oliver walking away, Roger called him-- "Do not go yet, Oliver. Wait minute, I come you." Oliver proceeded, however, thinking Roger would acquire courage yet he could carry his mummy show. Oliver going Mildred--to let her see, quite dark, done, found. When returned, Roger standing distance bank, apparently watching his mummy lay cleft he cleared. He started he heard Mildred's gentle voice exclaiming small dark-coloured. She next wondered old was. After boys examined ground again, put together heard ancient condition Levels, agreed person must buried, died alone woods, district became marsh. Pastor Dendel told Oliver thick forest covered lands Romans invaded Britain; inhabitants fled woods, hid Roman soldiers cut woods get them; trees, falling across courses streams, dammed up, surrounding soil turned swamp; mosses water-plants grew fallen trees, became matted together, vegetation grew top that, till ancient forest was, length, quite buried carr. Oliver reminded his sister this: looked kind veneration form supposed probably ancient Briton, who, flying invaders, recesses forest, perished alone. There appearance his buried. No earthen vessels, remains, usually found graves ancients, appeared contained bank. If he died lying along ground, his body would decayed like bodies, devoured wild beasts. Perhaps he drowned one ponds streams forest, body, immediately washed sand mud, thus preserved. "What use guessing guessing?" exclaimed Roger. "If people dig George's bones, bank, thousand years hence, find lying sort oven, would call it, fine carved stone one six sides, think could ever guess things came here?" "This way burying accident, one would think guessing," said Oliver, sighing. "And dried body may here, sure, accident know nothing about. I really wish, Roger, would cover corpse again; least, till know whether shall die together here." This Roger could never bear hear of. He always ran away it: he now. Dark growing, he passed house, mounted staircase (which stood firm ever, looked something like self-supported ladder). While he vainly looking abroad boats, shadows evening would prevented his seeing hundreds, brother sister speculated one thing more, connection spectacle powerfully excited imaginations. Mildred whispered Oliver-- "If old man George lie together here, I wonder whether spirits know it, come together heaven." They talked time difference must thoughts ancient Briton, skin-clothed, hunter wolf, living acorns wild animals forest, mind little child, reared Levels, nourished amused farm-yard garden. Yet agreed must things two different thought felt alike. The sky heads both, air around them, grass spread feet:--both, too, had, doubt, relations, beloved: saying many things may become known alike all, entering upon life death. Oliver Mildred resolved ever see Pastor Dendel again, would ask he thought this. They agreed would offer help Roger seek curiosities, make show of; would give him, his own, could find, he would consent bury body again, decently, beside little George. The supper eatable to-night; breakfast Sunday morning; yet Roger scarcely touched anything. Oliver heard tossing muttering night, sure he ill. He ill. He would allow he so, however; dressed fine clothes he taken chest. It plain, his shaking hand his heavy eye, he weak, his head aching much able work; therefore Ailwin helped Oliver finish grave. Roger inquired work proceeded: appeared he meant attend funeral, he found afternoon. His companions believe able: he doubted his heart, resolved he refuse believe ill, long he could keep thought. He found excuse, however, lying grass others engaged grave. Oliver hinted him, gently, Mildred he rather see dressed shabbiest clothes his own, following little brother his grave fine things could consider stolen. Roger was, reality, ashamed; he pretended angry; made use pretence stay behind. While he lay, ill miserable, remembering little George alone seemed love him, George dead, he believed impossible one mourn child he his heart. Oliver took something chest--carefully reverently; carefully reverently he put back night. There Bible, Dutch; Prayer-book. He carried these, Ailwin carried body, wrapped cloth, another piece hanging it, like pall. As Oliver took Mildred's hand, saw pale sorrowful she looked (though quite patient), he felt much need consolations hopes speak mourners book he held. Ailwin understand Dutch; Oliver thought kindest best say English he read, Bible Prayer-book. He read short portion Saint Paul says dead rising again. Then three assisted closing tomb, firmly completely; kneeled down, Oliver read prayer mourners his book. They sing; he sure Mildred could go hymn. He made sign her stay Ailwin went home; two sat grass bank, read together part Scripture Jesus desires his followers let hearts troubled, believe God him. Mildred soon quite happy; Oliver cheered see her so. He even began, time, talk future. He pointed waters sunk, leaving now, he supposed, three feet depth, besides mud slime. This mud would make soil fertile ever been, remainder flood could means drawn off. He thought his father might return, drain his ground, rebuild house. Then bank sat would overlook beautiful garden ever yet possessed. The whole land well _warped_ (that is, flooded fertilising mud) everything planted would flourish. They might get finest tulip-roots Holland, bed them; another choice auriculas, George's tomb; honeysuckles might trained round it, attract bees. Mildred liked hear this; she said so; she added she like better still to-morrow, perhaps. She felt strangely tired now, she could listen more, even she liked hear. "Are going ill, think, dear?" "I do not know. Do not think Roger ill?" "Yes; I dare say shall fever, damps bad smells place." "Well--never mind me, Oliver. I very, tired yet." "Come home, lie down, I sit beside you," said Oliver. "You patient, I know, dear. I try I patient, I see ill." He led her home, laid her down, scarcely left her many hours. It plain fever seized upon them; would stop, could tell? During night he Ailwin watched turns beside sick companions. This would necessary Mildred; Roger sometimes little delirious; afraid his frightening Mildred his startings strange sayings. When Ailwin came, dawn, take Oliver's place, she patted shoulder, bade go sleep, hurry rouse again; he would wanted anything he sleep till noon. Oliver tired enough; one thing he great mind he slept. He wished look staircase, sun risen, see whether moving speck wide waters--no promise help threatened his extremity. Ailwin thought perverse; oppose his going he said he sure he sleep better it. She soon, therefore, saw his figure among ruins roof, standing her brightening sky. CHAPTER ELEVEN. MORE HARDSHIP. This morning unlike mornings Oliver watched since flood came. There glowing sky towards east; he saw would broad train light waters, dazzle his eyes almost prevent his seeing anything else. It stormy-looking sunrise. Huge piles clouds lay eastern horizon, seemed impossible rays sun pierce. The distant church-spire looked black amidst grey flood: houses chapel Sandtoft, stood high water, dark dismal air. Oliver would rather glad believe would sunshine day, he feared would storm. He learned, days, associate reeking fogs putrid smells hot sunshine, shady day would relief: come tempest, could done sick members party? It dangerous stand trees thunderstorm; poor tent would soaked quarter hour's rain. He thought would best take tent, wrap Mildred Roger cloth; pile mattresses, one upon another, foot thickest tree could find; might chance one bed left dry poor Mildred. While arranging his mind, Oliver anxiously looking abroad moving speck grey waters. Seeing none, perceiving clouds slowly mounting sky, moving onwards, he felt he ought going hill, make preparations possible first raindrops fall. Slowly sadly he turned away so, when, casting one glance eastwards, he perceived something moving--a dark speck, leaving ruined roof dwelling stood half-way hamlet. There could doubt speck boat; came nearer, Oliver saw was--a large boat, quite full. He could distinguish figures it, heavy seemed mass people, goods, crowded. It came on, however; Oliver's heart beat faster came. How he wished he kept flag flying spot he stood! How he wished he signal fix height! Though boat-people still far distinguish figures, signal might catch eye. If he went Red-hill flag, boat might gone away his return. Trembling haste, he stripped his shirt, swung air. He even mounted top stone, which, surrounded wall, defence, hung waters below. Oliver would said, half hour before, he could stood alone perilous point: now, he stood there, waved his white signal his strength. Did anybody notice it? He thought he saw might oar lifted air; he sure. He presently certain something else--that boat moving away, direction approached, southwards. He tried, long he could, disbelieve this; went--away--away--and Oliver come his stone, put his clothes again, find thirsty he was. There hope still, he felt--great hope: he must keep Mildred, condition bear disappointment hope. He doubted whether Ailwin could control her tongue her countenance, possessed news. It would hard able tell one filled his thoughts; he resolved see first state Roger in. When he reached tent, Roger there. Ailwin could tell he was. He staggered away, like drunken person, she said-- he seemed giddy; she could leave Mildred see him, though he spoken lord; indeed could true boy like him. Ailwin looked clouds, every moment, she spoke; Mildred shivered, she missed morning sunshine. Oliver saw he must make ready storm, he prepared might follow. He Ailwin pulled long piece cloth support, doubled again, put Mildred middle it. Oliver longed lay her leafy tree; he dared not, account lightning, already beginning flash. He Ailwin set deal table sort penthouse her; busied themselves, her sight, piling together everything else had, keep many articles possible spoiling. Oliver thinking he might slip away seek Roger, he saw Mildred sobbing, heap cloth laid upon her. In moment he her side, saying-- "What matter, dear? Are afraid storm? I never knew afraid thunder lightning; perhaps may now, ill." "No," sobbed Mildred. "I cannot help glad storm," continued Oliver, "though disagreeable, time, people house go to. I hope clear air, freshen it; thing want, make better." "It that, Oliver. I do not mind storm all." "Then makes cry so, dear? Is Geordie?" "Yes. Something I do not think know; something I shall never bear think of. It make miserable long I live. Do know, I tired nursing him, hearing cry; I gave up--the thing I could him! I asked Ailwin take him. And two days he dead; I could never anything more." Here burst grief stopped her voice. Her brother said, solemnly,-- "Now, Mildred, listen me,--to little I say--for know I cannot, place, stay talk like, might done home. I think almost always kind Geordie; I sure he loved dearly. But I heard mother say worst part losing dear friends blame ourselves, less, behaviour them,--even loved most. So I flatter you, dear: though I do not wonder tired hearing Geordie cry day. I say whether right wrong; put mind may always ask pardon. Remember, too, may meet Geordie again; perhaps kinder ever one another here. Now I go, come back soon." "Stop one minute," implored Mildred. "I dreamed went away hill, left alone." As she said this, she looked her brother, painful wistfulness, he saw she fever-dream, yet quite clear remains. He laughed, something ridiculous; Mildred seemed like: he reminded her gravely, could get away place would. If opportunity occur, he assured her he would leave hold her hand. Nothing make step boat without her. Poor Mildred fancied, bewildered she morning, Oliver knew she done George, he would think justified leaving her perish hill; yet she could help telling him. Her mind relieved, present, she let go. He found Roger he first looked him,--near mummy. The poor lad ill stand; he lay slimy bank, poking grubbing, stick his fingers, deep soft soil he could penetrate. Oliver saw he found curiosities;--bunches nuts,--nuts ripening tree many hundreds seasons ago; hand plucked till now. Oliver could neither wonder admire, moment: he vexed (as he might another time) Roger's crawling hither, pursuit gain, made ill every breath he drew stooping rank mud. "Do not afraid, Roger," said Oliver. "I going touch findings, meddle you. I want change clothes,--to put finery,--and let know bag money took chest." Roger stared. "I going pack chest again; I want see everything it, may ready boat come." "Boat!" exclaimed Roger. "Yes: boat may come, know; must detain it, thing happen. If die without restoring money, Roger, sin upon soul: tell is, easy mind, I advise you. That good thing, live hundred years." "There boat now! You going leave behind!" cried Roger, scrambling his feet, falling weakness, two three times. "I knew it," he continued; "I dreamt last night; going come true to-day." "Mildred dreamed thing; ill," said Oliver. "Lean upon me--as heavily like--and I go home you, slowly will, tell money-bag is. You find boat now, whatever may by-and-by: tell money-bag is, I shake now, leave here. It another person's money: I must it." Roger said he would tell, Oliver would promise leave alone island. Oliver assured danger whatever deliverers party leaving others perish. He owned he bound make his sister his first care, Ailwin his next. As boys, Roger must satisfied thought last; he hoped neither ill turn other. He asked Roger ever received ill turn him. "That thing," said Roger, sorrowfully: "and many mine!" "I sure I forgive all, said that," cried Oliver. "I forgive forget all: would father, he heard you." "No! Would he? And he said he his would scorn like mine." "Did hear say that? You used hear every word said one another, I think." "It Ailwin threw teeth." "Father would say now: never Geordie knees made fond you, did." "Do really think so?" "I almost sure it. But he could help thinking badly keep money." "I going keep it. Do go find it, like, I cannot. It hollow elm stands two beeches, side wood. There little cross cut bark, south side--that help find it. But do not go till got tent." Oliver helped home, amidst lightning splashing rain, explaining went tent down, thinking best say nothing boat one weak-spirited Roger now. He ran off, found money-bag. He wished weather would clear, he might look again: but, meanwhile, he felt he losing time collecting together goods hill; tempest darkened filled air, he knew he could seen furlong distance, he his perch moment. He wore his mother's watch his pocket, feeling promised he meet her again, put back her hands. "Now, Oliver," said Ailwin, "I vexed sleep might, growling, splashing weather came on, something shelter head. If do not go sleep minute tempest over, I must see I must you: fever else; become me, among all, I like know? I wish would creep mattresses tree, never think storm, go sleep like good boy. It hardly likely lightning strike particular tree, it." "But chance find cinder, thought time waking, Ailwin--would bad fever?" "Oliver! How talk so? How dare think shocking thing?" "You put head, Ailwin. But come--let tell thing I want do, I away stops raining. Here Roger's old clothes, safe dry beds. When leaves raining, make pull his wet finery, put his dry things; keep finery somewhere his way, I may put back chest, ought lying now. Will this, Ailwin?" "Why, I will see. If I quite sure he nothing storm, I might manage I could boy." "Anybody may manage to-day, little kindness. He ill weak-spirited; touch his heart word. If remember George cried him, gentle him, I know." "Well, that is true: I doubt whether lord would spoken him, he dangerous he seems sometimes. Now, dinner to-day, Oliver--I really do not like give Mildred food game island is. I sure downright unwholesome. Bird beast, dying faster kill them." "The fowls done, I hope. I thought meal-fed fowls left." "Just two; all: truth is, I do not like part two poor things, enjoying meal-picking together; then, last wholesome food." "Then let us wholesome. Boil one to-day, make broth nice Mildred. We cook to-morrow." "And next day?" "We see day comes. Oh dear! When clouds emptied themselves? Surely cannot pour rate long." "The thunder lightning over, that is comfort," said Ailwin. "You might stand tree, now, Oliver; go wandering about, duck heart, loved rain." Ailwin might wonder, Oliver indeed restless. While waiting moment he might cross staircase, he could even stand still tree. The secret his seen boat heavy one borne he longer busy. He felt he tell, he remained beside his sister Ailwin; he wandered off, wood, try far he could see waters south, tempest passing away. Through trees he saw one--a tall person, walking grass water-side. He ran--he flew. There boat lying bank, two three men walking towards wood. The foremost Pastor Dendel. Oliver sprang his arms, clung round his neck moment, fainted away. CHAPTER TWELVE. NEWS. Oliver soon recovered. The strong, manly caress pastor seemed revive him, even water others threw his face. His first word "Mother." "She safe, boy: she well I take her. Are alone here, Oliver?" "Alone! O no! Do not let men go startle Mildred rest--" "Thank God!" exclaimed Pastor Dendel. The two men seemed raise shout, wave hats, pastor forbade gesture. He whispered Oliver,-- "Mildred, else, dear? We know nothing, aware. Your father--?" "He carried mill,--out Humber--" Oliver stopped, he saw men exchange look awe, took his breath away again. "We something like news father too, Oliver. There rumour makes us hope he may safe distance. Your mother believes it, she tell you. Is possible alive, calamity this?" "George dead, sir. We buried yesterday. Ailwin here, Mildred me; Roger Redfurn." One men observed he hoped, one good would come flood, Levels rid Redfurns. "Do say that," said Oliver. "Roger helped us many things; he kind little George. Let go, sir. I walk well: I want tell come." "Go, boy: gently, Oliver,--gently." "That I want, sir,--that see hear you: Mildred ill,--and Roger too. Please keep sight till I come you. So mother safe,--really?" "Really, take her." Mildred, lying uncomfortably soaked cloth (for rain penetrated everything), yet dozing,--now starting calling out. Oliver took her hand, wake her up, asked her, smile, she opened her eyes, whether she dreaming boat again. Mildred believed not, her head sadly confused; much so, she heard boat really come, pastor her parents, without showing surprise pleasure. Little ceremony necessary strong Ailwin; one men made short work Roger, lifting carrying boat. Oliver said word pastor seeing George's grave, chest money-bag belonged somebody might want much. The pastor took charge bag, declared everything else must left another trip, leisure time. Mrs Linacre waiting,--and state expectation! While two stout rowers pulling rapidly away Red-hill, direction Gainsborough, pastor explained party wanted know. Mrs Linacre heard rumour alarmed her day flood, locked her she would, set homewards waters gushed her road, compelled her turn back. Like multitude others, anxious miserable herself, she ever since wandering search boat, imploring aid every one she met. For three days, appeared really boats district. Some certainly swamped broken rush flood: great difficulty bringing round coast could fishermen. Some farmers hill lent oxen, bring boats hills; others, men row them; time save many lives. What number lost, impossible yet say; cleverness hopefulness multitude struggled life, five days hardship peril wonderful admirable. Mrs Linacre trusted power God gives his children extremity, persuaded throughout (except short moments despair), she see her husband children again. In persuasion she sustained pastor, moment his finding her, his escape. Of his escape pastor would say nothing present. The children's minds full tales wonder horror must hear hereafter. Neither would he permit word origin flood. He said must think little could wicked deeds men, hour God's mercy. One prayer, every heart, God would forgive evil-minded men,--one prayer let be; then, disturbing thoughts enemies hour preservation. Oliver could trust ask, presence strangers, rumour was, pastor mentioned, his father. The pastor apt understand stirring people's hearts; he knew Oliver's moment. He explained sailor declared, landing Hull, ship he spoken Dutch vessel, Humber, night, light lanterns only, voice heard, deck Dutchman, crying out, "Will one charity tell wife Linacre Levels he saved?" The sailors fears voice--thought message odd--fancied voice like suppose ghost's be; length, persuaded one another came, ship, air overhead; message meant Linacre dead, his soul saved. When came ashore, however, found befallen Levels, began doubt whether not, all, voice flesh blood man called them. When pastor heard miller floated his mill, he little doubt good man picked Humber, vessel sailing Holland, could stop set ashore, contained him, safe well. Within two months, he would heard seen, might fairly hoped. Mrs Linacre kindly taken care farm-house, near spring-- farm-house she often taken her copper money changed silver: she little within doors, day night. She paced day brink flood; long moon up, sat night rising ground, looking waters towards Red-hill. She discovered mill gone, eyes could distinguish nothing far off. No one glass lend her-- so, least, said; whispered glass might procured, thought she could see would distress her, nothing could her good. She brink water boat came near. She would thrown herself meet her children, neighbour hold her back. Oliver's first words her were, he believed his father safe his way Holland, would soon coming back. The pastor's first words were, he placed Mildred her arms-- "Two children restored you. Will patiently resign little one?" The speechless mother hurrying away, Mildred her bosom, drawing Oliver hand, she clasped convulsively, he said-- "Mother, help keep promise I made. Here Roger Redfurn-- ill. I promised would forsake him. Let go us, till he well." "Whatever will, boy; leave me, Oliver,--not moment." "Go on," said pastor. "We bringing Roger you. We shall home soon you." "Home," friendly farm-house. There, end day, Oliver learned his morning signal seen large boat; reason large boat rowed away was, full, waters shallow Red-hill small craft. Before end day Mrs Linacre seen look like herself more; Ailwin told wondering neighbours tale days, seemed like years look back upon. She told even Oliver observed miserable state place refuge, would soon place death. Scarcely breathing thing, she said, left alive: and, going boat, she seen soaked bee-hives upset, chilled bees lying about, spirit left them. She shuddered she thought Red-hill. Then she stimulated farm-house people take care Roger,--a task Oliver left little do. They willing enough, however; Ailwin told though Roger odd boy his time, owing his brought queer people, yet, considering people drowned gone, Roger noticed lord, she doubt he might turn well, pleased God. How closely Mildred clasp her mother's neck evening! Knowing nothing else, feeling strangely, she yet understood she place shelter comfort, felt her head rested her mother's bosom--on pillow something far better warmth softness. By degrees she began aware cool fresh water, sweet-smelling flowers, she tenderly bathed, laid rest bed neither wet tree. There surprising silence round her, she felt, she grew stronger, one yet attempted explain her; her mother smiled her happily, she supposed she recovering. Mrs Linacre look happy, even midst her tears her poor baby. Mildred _was_ recovering, Oliver ate slept, whistled window--like light-hearted boy, he amused carving every piece hard wood he could find. It clear he escaped fever; every day refreshed his colour, filled his thin face again, brought nearer hour his father's return.
