 THE LITTLE LAME PRINCE AND HIS TRAVELING CLOACK CHAPTER I. Yes, he beautiful Prince ever born. Of course, prince, people said this: true besides. When he looked candle, his eyes expression earnest inquiry quite startling new-born baby. His nose--there much certainly, seemed aquiline shape; his complexion charming, healthy purple; he round fat, straight-limbed long--in fact, splendid baby, everybody exceedingly proud him. Especially his father mother, King Queen Nomansland, waited happy reign ten years--now made happier ever, subjects, appearance son heir. The person quite happy king's brother, heir-presumptive, would king one day, baby born. But his Majesty kind him, even rather sorry him--insomuch Queen's request he gave dukedom almost big county,--the Crown Prince, he called, tried seem pleased also; let us hope he succeeded. The Prince's christening grand affair. According custom country, chosen four-and-twenty godfathers godmothers, give name, promise utmost him. When he came age, he choose name--and god-father godmother--that he liked best, rest his days. Meantime, rejoicing. Subscriptions made among rich give pleasure poor: dinners town-halls working men; tea-parties streets wives; milk bun feasts children schoolrooms. For Nomansland, though I cannot point map, read history, was, I believe, much like many another country. As Palace--which different palaces--it clean "turned windows," people say, preparations going on. The quiet place room which, though Prince six weeks old, his mother Queen never quitted. Nobody said she ill, however; would inconvenient; she said nothing herself, lay pale placid, giving trouble anybody, nobody thought much her. All world absorbed admiring baby. [Illustration: "_All people palace lovely too--or thought so, ...from ladies-in-waiting ..._"] [Illustration: "_The poor little kitchenmaid ... her pink cotton gown ... thought doubtless, never pretty girl._"] The christening-day came last, lovely Prince himself. All people palace lovely too--or thought so, elegant new clothes queen, thought everybody, taken care give them, ladies-in-waiting poor little kitchenmaid, looked herself her pink cotton gown, thought, doubtless, never pretty girl she. By six morning royal household dressed best; little Prince dressed his best--his magnificent christening-robe; proceeding his Royal Highness like all, kicked screamed like common baby. When he little calmed down, carried looked Queen his mother, who, though her royal robes brought laid upon bed, was, everybody well knew, quite unable rise put on. She admired her baby much; kissed blessed him, lay looking him, she hours sometimes, he placed beside her fast asleep; she gave gentle smile, saying "she hoped he would good, would nice christening, guests would enjoy themselves," turned peacefully her bed, saying nothing anybody. She uncomplaining person--the Queen, her name Dolorez. Everything went exactly she present. All, even King himself, grown used her absence, she strong, years joined gaieties. She always her royal duties, pleasures, could go quite well without her, seemed so. The company arrived: great notable persons neighboring countries; also four-and-twenty godfathers godmothers, chosen care, people would useful his Royal Highness, he ever want friends, seem likely. What want could possibly happen heir powerful monarch Nomansland? They came, walking two two, coronets heads--being dukes duchesses, prince princesses, like; kissed child, pronounced name given him. Then four-and-twenty names shouted great energy six heralds, one other, afterwards written down, preserved state records, readiness next time wanted would either his Royal Highness's coronation his funeral. Soon ceremony over, everybody satisfied; except, perhaps, little Prince himself, moaned faintly his christening robes, nearly smothered him. In truth, though knew, Prince coming chapel met slight disaster. His nurse--not his ordinary one, state nursemaid, elegant fashionable young lady rank, whose duty carry chapel, occupied arranging her train one hand, she held baby other, she stumbled let fall, foot marble staircase. To sure, she contrived pick next minute, accident slight seemed hardly worth speaking of. Consequently, nobody speak it. The baby turned deadly pale cry, person step two behind could discover anything wrong; afterwards, even he moaned, silver trumpets loud enough drown his voice. It would pity let anything trouble day felicity. So, minute's pause, procession moved on. Such procession! Heralds blue silver; pages crimson gold; troop little girls dazzling white, carrying baskets flowers, strewed way nurse child,--finally four-and-twenty godfathers godmothers, proud possible, splendid look would quite extinguished small godson--merely heap lace muslin baby-face inside--had canopy white satin ostrich feathers, held wherever he carried. [Illustration: "_The procession moved on. Such procession! Heralds blue silver; pages crimson gold._"] Thus, sun shining painted windows, stood; King his train one side, Prince his attendants other, pretty sight ever seen fairyland. "It is like fairyland," whispered eldest little girl next eldest, she shook last rose her basket; "and I think thing Prince wants fairy godmother." "Does he?" said shrill soft unpleasant voice behind; seen among group children somebody--not child--yet bigger child: somebody nobody seen before, certainly invited, she christening clothes on. She little old woman dressed grey: grey gown, grey hooded cloak, material excessively fine, tint seemed perpetually changing, like grey evening sky. Her hair grey her eyes also; even her complexion soft grey shadow it. But nothing unpleasantly old her, her smile sweet childlike Prince's own, stole his pale little face instant she came near enough touch him. "Take care. Do not let baby fall again." The grand young lady nurse started, flushing angrily. "Who spoke me? How anybody know?--I mean, business anybody--?" Then, frightened, still speaking much sharper tone I hope young ladies rank habit speaking--"Old woman, kind enough say 'the baby,' 'the Prince.' Keep away; his Royal Highness going sleep." "Nevertheless, I must kiss him. I his godmother." "You!" cried elegant lady nurse. "You!!" repeated gentlemen ladies waiting. "You!!!" echoed heralds pages--and began blow silver trumpets, order stop conversation. The Prince's procession formed returning--the King his train already moved towards palace--but, topmost step marble stairs, stood, right front all, little old woman clothed grey. She stretched herself tiptoe help her stick, gave little Prince three kisses. "This intolerable," cried young lady nurse, wiping kisses rapidly her lace handkerchief. "Such insult his Royal Highness. Take way, old woman, King shall informed immediately." "The King knows nothing me, more's pity," replied old woman indifferent air, she thought loss his Majesty's side hers. "My friend palace King's wife." "Kings' wives called queens," said lady nurse, contemptuous air. "You right," replied old woman. "Nevertheless, I know her Majesty well, I love her her child. And--since dropped marble stairs (this she said mysterious whisper, made young lady tremble spite her anger)--I choose take own. I his godmother, ready help whenever he wants me." "You help him!" cried group, breaking shouts laughter, little old woman paid slightest attention. Her soft grey eyes fixed Prince, seemed answer look, smiling causeless, aimless fashion, babies smile. "His Majesty must hear this," said gentleman-in-waiting. "His Majesty hear quite enough news minute two," said old woman sadly. And stretching little Prince, she kissed forehead solemnly. "Be called new name nobody ever thought of. Be Prince Dolor, memory mother Dolorez." "In memory of!" Everybody started ominous phrase, also terrible breach etiquette old woman committed. In Nomansland, neither king queen supposed Christian name all. They dropped coronation-day, never mentioned till engraved coffins died. "Old woman, exceedingly ill-bred," cried eldest lady-in-waiting, much horrified. "How could know fact passes comprehension. But even know it, dared presume hint her gracious Majesty called Dolorez?" "_Was_ called Dolorez," said old woman tender solemnity. The first gentleman, called Gold-stick-in-waiting, raised strike her, rest stretched hands seize her; grey mantle melted fingers like air; and, anybody time anything more, came heavy, muffled, startling sound. The great bell palace--the bell heard death Royal family, many times he she years old--began toll. They listened, mute horror-stricken. Some one counted: One--two--three--four--up nine twenty--just queen's age. It was, indeed, Queen. Her Majesty dead! In midst festivities she slipped away, her new happiness her old sufferings, neither small. Sending away her women see sight--at least, said afterwards, excuse, she done so, like her it--she turned her face window, whence one could see tops distant mountains--the Beautiful Mountains, called--where she born. So gazing, she quietly died. When little Prince carried back his mother's room, mother kiss him. And, though he know it, would mother's kiss more. As his Godmother--the little old woman grey called herself so--whether she melted air, like her gown touched it, whether she flew chapel window, slipped doorway among bewildered crowd, nobody knew--nobody ever thought her. Only nurse, ordinary homely one, coming Prince's nursery middle night search cordial quiet his continual moans, saw, sitting doorway, something she would thought mere shadow, she seen shining two eyes, grey soft sweet. She put her hand her own, screaming loudly. When she took away, old woman gone. CHAPTER II. Everybody kind poor little Prince. I think people generally kind motherless children, whether princes peasants. He magnificent nursery, regular suite attendants, treated greatest respect state. Nobody allowed talk silly baby language, dandle him, kiss him, though, perhaps, people surreptitiously, he sweet baby difficult help it. It could said Prince missed his mother; children his age cannot that; somehow she died everything seemed go wrong him. From beautiful baby he became sickly pale, seeming almost ceased growing, especially his legs, fat strong. But day his christening withered shrank; he longer kicked either passion play, when, he got nearly year old, his nurse tried make stand upon them, he tumbled down. This happened many times last people began talk it. A prince, able stand his legs! What dreadful thing! misfortune country! Rather misfortune also, poor little boy! nobody seemed think that. And when, while, his health revived, old bright look came back his sweet little face, his body grew larger stronger, though still his legs remained same, people continued speak whispers, grave shakes head. Everybody knew, though nobody said it, something, impossible guess what, quite right poor little Prince. Of course, nobody hinted King his father: tell great people anything unpleasant. And besides, his Majesty took little notice his son, his affairs, beyond necessary duties his kingdom. People said he would miss Queen all, she long invalid: he did. After her death he never quite same. He established her empty rooms, rooms palace whence one could see Beautiful Mountains, often observed looking he thought she flown away thither, his longing could bring her back again. And curious coincidence, nobody dared inquire into, he desired Prince might called, four-and-twenty grand names given his godfathers godmothers, identical name mentioned little old woman grey,--Dolor, his mother Dolorez. Once week, according established state custom, Prince, dressed his best, brought King his father half-an-hour, his Majesty generally ill melancholy pay much heed child. Only once, he Crown Prince, exceedingly attentive his royal brother, sitting together, Prince Dolor playing corner room, dragging his arms rather his legs, sometimes trying feebly crawl one chair another, seemed strike father right his son. "How old his Royal Highness?" said he suddenly nurse. "Two years, three months, five days, please Majesty." [Illustration: _"How old his Royal Highness?" said he suddenly nurse._] "It please me," said King sigh. "He ought far forward he now, ought he not, brother? You, many children, must know. Is something wrong him?" "Oh, no," said Crown Prince, exchanging meaning looks nurse, understand all, stood frightened trembling tears her eyes. "Nothing make Majesty uneasy. No doubt his Royal Highness outgrow time." "Outgrow--what?" "A slight delicacy--ahem!--in spine; something inherited, perhaps, his dear mother." "Ah, she always delicate; she sweetest woman ever lived. Come here, little son." And Prince turned round upon his father small, sweet, grave face--so like his mother's--his Majesty King smiled held his arms. But boy came him, running like boy, wriggling awkwardly along floor, royal countenance clouded over. "I ought told this. It terrible--terrible! And prince, too! Send doctors kingdom immediately." They came, gave different opinion, ordered different mode treatment. The thing agreed pretty well known before: prince must hurt he infant--let fall, perhaps, injure his spine lower limbs. Did nobody remember? No, nobody. Indignantly, nurses denied accident happened, possible happened, faithful country nurse recollected really happened, day christening. For unluckily good memory others scolded her severely she peace her life, soon after, influence young lady nurse carried baby fatal day, sort connection Crown Prince, his wife's second cousin removed, poor woman pensioned off, sent Beautiful Mountains, whence she came, orders remain rest her days. But King knew nothing, for, indeed, first shock finding his son could walk, seemed never likely walk, he interfered little concerning him. The whole thing painful, his Majesty never liked painful things. Sometimes he inquired Prince Dolor, told his Royal Highness going well could expected, really case. For worrying poor child perplexing one remedy another, Crown Prince, wishing offend differing doctors, proposed leaving nature; nature, safest doctor all, come his help, done her best. He could walk, true; his limbs mere useless additions his body; body strong sound. And his face ever--just his mother's face, one sweetest world! Even King, indifferent he was, sometimes looked little fellow sad tenderness, noticing cleverly he learned crawl, swing his arms, his awkward way he active motion children his age. "Poor little man! he his best, he unhappy; half unhappy I, brother," addressing Crown Prince, constant ever his attendance upon sick monarch. "If anything befall me, I appointed Regent. In case death, take care poor little boy?" "Certainly, certainly; let us imagine misfortune. I assure Majesty--everybody assure you--that least likely." He knew, however, everybody knew, likely, soon actually happen. The King died, suddenly quietly Queen done--indeed, her room bed; Prince Dolor left without either father mother--as sad thing could happen, even Prince. He now, though. He king. In Nomansland, countries, people struck grief one day revived next. "The king dead--long live king!" cry rang nation, almost his late Majesty laid beside queen splendid mausoleum, crowds came thronging parts royal palace, eager see new monarch. They see him--the Prince Regent took care should--sitting floor council-chamber, sucking his thumb! And one gentlemen-in-waiting lifted carried him--fancy, carrying king!--to chair state, put crown his head, he shook again, heavy uncomfortable. Sliding foot throne, he began playing golden lions supported it, stroking paws putting his tiny fingers eyes, laughing--laughing he last found something amuse him. "There is fine king you!" said first lord-in-waiting, friend Prince Regent's (the Crown Prince used be, who, deepest mourning, stood silently beside throne his young nephew. He handsome man, grand clever looking). "What king! never stand receive his subjects, never walk processions, who, last day his life, carried like baby. Very unfortunate!" "Exceedingly unfortunate," repeated second lord. "It always bad nation king child; child--a permanent cripple, worse." "Let us hope worse," said first lord hopeless tone, looking towards Regent, stood erect pretended hear nothing. "I heard sort children large heads great broad foreheads staring eyes, are----well, well, let us hope best prepared worst. In meantime----" "I swear," said Crown Prince, coming forward kissing hilt his sword--"I swear perform duties regent, take care his Royal Highness--his Majesty, I mean," grand bow little child, laughed innocently back again. "And I humble best govern country. Still, country slightest objection----" But Crown Prince generalissimo, whole army his beck call, he could begun civil war time; country had, course, slightest objection. So king queen slept together peace, Prince Dolor reigned land--that is, his uncle did; everybody said fortunate thing poor little Prince clever uncle take care him. All things went usual; indeed, Regent brought his wife her seven sons, established palace, rather better usual. For gave splendid entertainments made capital lively, trade revived, country said flourishing century. Whenever Regent his sons appeared, received shouts--"Long live Crown Prince!" "Long live Royal family!" And, truth, fine children, whole seven them, made great show rode together seven beautiful horses, one height another, youngest, his tiny black pony, bigger large dog. [Illustration: "_And, truth, fine children, whole seven them._"] [Illustration: "_They made great show rode together seven beautiful horses._"] As child, his Royal Highness Prince Dolor--for somehow people soon ceased call his Majesty, seemed ridiculous title poor little fellow, helpless cripple, head trunk, legs speak of--he seen seldom anybody. Sometimes, people daring enough peer high wall palace garden, noticed there, carried footman's arms, drawn chair, left play grass, often nobody mind him, pretty little boy, bright intelligent face, large melancholy eyes--no, exactly melancholy, his mother's, she means sad-minded, thoughtful dreamy. They rather perplexed people, childish eyes; exceedingly innocent yet penetrating. If anybody wrong thing, told lie instance, would turn round grave silent surprise--the child never talked much--that every naughty person palace rather afraid Prince Dolor. He could help it, perhaps he even know it, better child many children, something made bad people sorry, grumbling people ashamed themselves, ill-natured people gentle kind. I suppose, touched see poor little fellow least know befallen him, lay him, living his baby life happy day long. Thus, whether he good himself, sight his affliction made people good, and, all, made everybody love him. So much so, his uncle Regent began feel little uncomfortable. Now, I nothing say uncles general. They usually excellent people, convenient little boys girls. Even "cruel uncle" "The Babes Wood" I believe quite exceptional character. And "cruel uncle" I telling was, I hope, exception too. He mean cruel. If anybody called so, he would resented extremely: he would said he done entirely good country. But he man always accustomed consider first foremost, believing whatever he wanted sure right, and, therefore, he ought it. So he tried get it, got too, people like often do. Whether enjoy it, another question. Therefore, he went one day council-chamber, determined making speech informing ministers country large young King failing health, would advisable send time Beautiful Mountains. Whether he really meant this; whether occurred afterwards would easier way attaining his great desire, crown Nomansland, point I cannot decide. But soon after, he obtained order council send King away--which done great state, guard honour composed two whole regiments soldiers--the nation learnt, without much surprise, poor little Prince--nobody ever called king now--had gone much longer journey Beautiful Mountains. He fallen ill road died within hours; least, declared physician attendance, nurse sent take care him. They brought his coffin back great state, buried mausoleum his parents. So Prince Dolor seen more. The country went deep mourning him, forgot him, his uncle reigned his stead. That illustrious personage accepted his crown great decorum, wore great dignity, last. But whether he enjoyed not, evidence show. CHAPTER III. And little lame prince, everybody seemed easily forgotten? Not everybody. There kind souls, mothers families, heard his sad story, servants palace, familiar his sweet ways--these many time sighed said, "Poor Prince Dolor!" Or, looking Beautiful Mountains, visible Nomansland, though people ever visited them, "Well, perhaps his Royal Highness better he even there." They know--indeed, hardly anybody know--that beyond mountains, sea, lay tract country, barren, level, bare, except short stunted grass, patch tiny flowers. Not bush--not tree--not resting-place bird beast dreary plain. In summer, sunshine fell upon hour hour blinding glare; winter, winds rains swept unhindered, snow came down, steadily, noiselessly, covering end end one great white sheet, lay days weeks unmarked single footprint. [Illustration: "_One large round tower rose center plain._"] Not pleasant place live in--and nobody live there, apparently. The sign human creatures ever near spot, one large round tower rose centre plain, might seen it--if anybody see, never was. Rose, right ground, grown itself, like mushroom. But mushroom-like; contrary, solidly built. In form, resembled Irish round towers, puzzled people long, nobody able find when, whom, purpose made; seemingly use all, like tower. It circular, firm brickwork, neither doors windows, near top, could perceive slits wall, one might possibly creep look out. Its height nearly hundred feet high, battlemented parapet, showing sharp sky. As plain quite desolate--almost like desert, without sand, led nowhere except still desolate sea-coast--nobody ever crossed it. Whatever mystery tower, sky plain kept secret themselves. It great secret indeed--a state secret--which none clever man present king Nomansland would ever thought of. How he carried out, undiscovered, I cannot tell. People said, long afterwards, means gang condemned criminals, set work, executed immediately done, nobody knew anything, least suspected real fact. And fact? Why, tower, seemed mere mass masonry, utterly forsaken uninhabited, all. Within twenty feet top, ingenious architect planned perfect little house, divided four rooms--as drawing cross within circle see might easily done. By making skylights, slits walls windows, raising peaked roof hidden parapet, dwelling complete; eighty feet ground, inaccessible rook's nest top tree. A charming place live in! got there, never wanted come again. Inside--though nobody could looked inside except bird, hardly even bird flew past lonely tower--inside furnished comfort elegance imaginable; lots books toys, everything heart child could desire. For inhabitant, except nurse course, poor little solitary child. One winter night, plain white moonlight, seen crossing great tall black horse, ridden man also big equally black, carrying saddle woman child. The woman--she sad, fierce look, wonder, she criminal sentence death, her sentence changed almost severe punishment. She inhabit lonely tower child, allowed live long child lived--no longer. This, order she might take utmost care him; put equally afraid his dying his living. And yet he little gentle boy, sweet sleepy smile--he tired his long journey--and clinging arms, held tight man's neck, he rather frightened, face, black was, looked kindly him. And he helpless, his poor small shrivelled legs, could neither stand run away--for little forlorn boy Prince Dolor. [Illustration: "_He rather frightened, face, black was, looked kindly him._"] He dead all--or buried either. His grand funeral mere pretence: wax figure put his place, he spirited away charge two, condemned woman black man. The latter deaf dumb, could neither tell repeat anything. When reached foot tower, light enough see huge chain dangling parapet, dangling half way. The deaf-mute took his saddle-wallet sort ladder, arranged pieces like puzzle, fitted together lifted meet chain. Then he mounted top tower, slung sort chair, woman child placed drawn up, never come long lived. Leaving there, man descended ladder, took pieces packed his pack, mounted horse, disappeared across plain. Every month used watch him, appearing like speck distance. He fastened his horse foot tower climbed it, before, laden provisions many things. He always saw Prince, make sure child alive well, went away following month. While his first childhood lasted, Prince Dolor happy enough. He every luxury even prince could need, one thing wanting--love, never known, he miss. His nurse kind him, though she wicked woman. But either she quite wicked people said, she grew better shut continually little innocent child, dependent upon her every comfort pleasure his life. It unhappy life. There nobody tease ill-use him, he never ill. He played room room--there four rooms--parlour, kitchen, his nurse's bed-room, his own; learnt crawl like fly, jump like frog, run all-fours almost fast puppy. In fact, he much like puppy kitten, thoughtless merry--scarcely ever cross, though sometimes little weary. As he grew older, he occasionally liked quiet awhile, he would sit slits windows, were, however, much bigger looked bottom tower,--and watch sky ground below, storms sweeping sunshine coming going, shadows clouds running races across blank plain. By-and-by he began learn lessons--not his nurse ordered teach him, she partly amuse herself. She stupid woman, Prince Dolor means stupid boy; got well, his continual entreaty "What I do? find do?" stopped; least hour two day. It dull life, he never known other; anyhow, he remembered other; he pity all. Not long time, till he grew quite big little boy, could read easily. Then he suddenly took books, deaf-mute brought time time--books which, acquainted literature Nomansland, I cannot describe, doubt interesting; informed everything outside world, filled intense longing see it. From time change came boy. He began look sad thin, shut hours without speaking. For his nurse hardly spoke, whatever questions he asked beyond ordinary daily life she never answered. She had, indeed, forbidden, pain death, tell anything himself, he was, he might been. He knew he Prince Dolor, she always addressed "my prince," "your royal highness," prince he least idea. He idea thing world, except he found his books. He sat one day surrounded them, built round like little castle wall. He reading half day, feeling read things never see like hearing beautiful dinner starving. For almost first time his life he grew melancholy: his hands fell his lap; he sat gazing window-slit upon view outside--the view he looked every day his life, might look endless days more. Not cheerful view--just plain sky--but he liked it. He used think, he could fly window, sky plain, nice would be! Perhaps he died--his nurse told anger he would never leave tower till he died--he might able this. Not he understood much dying meant, must change, change seemed blessing. "And I wish I somebody tell it; many things; somebody would fond me, like poor white kitten." Here tears came his eyes, boy's one friend, one interest his life, little white kitten, deaf-mute, kindly smiling, took his pocket gave him--the living creature Prince Dolor ever seen. For four weeks his constant plaything companion, till one moonlight night took fancy wandering, climbed parapet tower, dropped disappeared. It killed, he hoped, cats nine lives; indeed, he almost fancied he saw pick scamper away, he never caught sight more. "Yes, I wish I something better kitten--a person, real live person, would fond kind me. Oh, I want somebody--dreadfully, dreadfully!" As he spoke, sounded behind slight tap-tap-tap, stick cane, twisting round, he saw--what think he saw? Nothing either frightening ugly, still exceedingly curious. A little woman, bigger he might been, his legs grown like children, she child--she old woman. Her hair grey, her dress grey, grey shadow her whereever she moved. But she sweetest smile, prettiest hands, she spoke softest voice imaginable. "My dear little boy,"--and dropping her cane, bright rich thing her, she laid two tiny hands his shoulders--"my little boy, I could come said wanted me, want me, I am." [Illustration: "_She laid two tiny hands his shoulders--'My little boy, I could come said wanted me.'_"] "And welcome, madam," replied Prince, trying speak politely, princes always books; "and I exceedingly obliged you. May I ask are? Perhaps mother?" For he knew little boys usually mother, occasionally wondered become his own. "No," said visitor, tender, half-sad smile, putting back hair his forehead, looking right his eyes--"No, I mother, though she dear friend mine; like her ever be." "Will tell her come see then?" "She cannot; I dare say she knows you. And she loves much--and I; I want help I can, poor little boy." "Why call poor?" asked Prince Dolor surprise. The little old woman glanced his legs feet, he know different children, his sweet, bright face, which, though he knew either, exceedingly different many children's faces, often fretful, cross, sullen. Looking him, instead sighing, she smiled. "I beg pardon, prince," said she. "Yes, I prince, name Dolor; tell yours, madam?" The little old woman laughed like chime silver bells. "I got name--or rather, I many names I do not know choose. However, I gave yours, belong days. I godmother." "Hurrah!" cried little prince; "I glad I belong you, I like much. Will come play me?" So sat together, played. By-and-by began talk. "Are dull here?" asked little old woman. "Not particularly, thank you, godmother. I plenty eat drink, lessons do, books read--lots books." "And want nothing?" "Nothing. Yes--perhaps--If please, godmother, could bring one thing?" "What sort thing?" "A little boy play with." The old woman looked sad. "Just thing, alas, I cannot give you. My child, I cannot alter lot way, I help bear it." "Thank you. But talk bearing it? I nothing bear." "My poor little man!" said old woman tenderest tone her tender voice. "Kiss me!" "What kissing?" asked wondering child. His godmother took her arms embraced many times. By-and-by he kissed her back again--at first awkwardly shyly, strength his warm little heart. "You better cuddle even white kitten, I think. Promise never go away." "I must; I leave present behind me--something good amuse you--something take wherever want go, show wish see." "What it?" "A travelling-cloak." The Prince's countenance fell. "I do not want cloak, I never go out. Sometimes nurse hoists roof, carries round parapet; all. I cannot walk, know, she does." "The reason ride; besides, travelling-cloak----" "Hush!--she is coming." There sounded outside room door heavy step grumpy voice, rattle plates dishes. "It is nurse, she bringing dinner; I do not want dinner all--I want you. Will her coming drive away, godmother?" "Perhaps; little. Never mind; bolts bars world could not keep out. I would fly window, chimney. Only wish me, I come." "Thank you," said Prince Dolor, almost whisper, he uneasy might happen next. His nurse his godmother--what would say one another? would look one another?--two different faces: one, harsh-lined, sullen, cross, sad; other, sweet bright calm summer evening dark begins. When door flung open, Prince Dolor shut his eyes, trembling over: opening again, he saw he need fear nothing; his lovely old godmother melted away like rainbow sky, he watched many time. Nobody his nurse room. "What muddle Royal Highness sitting in," said she sharply. "Such heap untidy books; what is rubbish?" kicking little bundle lay beside them. "Oh, nothing, nothing--give me!" cried prince, darting it, he hid his pinafore, pushed quickly his pocket. Rubbish was, left place she sat, might something belonging her--his dear, kind godmother, already he loved his lonely, tender, passionate heart. It was, though he know this, his wonderful travelling-cloak. CHAPTER IV. And travelling-cloak? What sort cloak it, good Prince? Stay, I will tell it. Outside commonest-looking bundle imaginable--shabby small; instant Prince Dolor touched it, grew smaller still, dwindling till he could put his trousers pocket, like handkerchief rolled ball. He once, fear his nurse see it, kept day--all night, too. Till his next morning's lessons he opportunity examining his treasure. When he did, seemed treasure all; mere piece cloth--circular form, dark green colour, is, colour all, worn shabby, though dirty. It split cut centre, forming round hole neck--and shape; shape, fact, cloaks South America called _ponchos_--very simple, graceful convenient. Prince Dolor never seen anything like it. In spite his disappointment he examined curiously; spread floor, arranged his shoulders. It felt warm comfortable; exceedingly shabby--the shabby thing Prince ever seen his life. [Illustration: "_Prince Dolor never seen anything like it. In spite his disappointment he examined curiously._"] "And use me?" said he sadly. "I need outdoor clothes, I never go out. Why given me, I wonder? world I it? She must rather funny person, dear godmother mine." Nevertheless, she his godmother, given cloak, he folded carefully put away, poor shabby was, hiding safe corner his toy-cupboard, his nurse never meddled with. He want her find it, laugh it, his godmother--as he felt sure she would, she knew all. There lay, by-and-by he forgot it; nay, I sorry say, that, child, seeing her again, he almost forgot his sweet old godmother, thought her he angels fairies he read his books, her visit mere dream night. There times, certainly, he recalled her; early mornings like morning she appeared beside him, late evenings, grey twilight reminded colour her hair her pretty soft garments; all, when, waking middle night, stars peering his window, moonlight shining across his little bed, he would surprised see her standing beside it, looking beautiful tender eyes, seemed pleasantness comfort different anything he ever known. But she never came, gradually she slipped his memory--only boy's memory, all; something happened made remember her, want her he never wanted anything before. Prince Dolor fell ill. He caught--his nurse could tell how--a complaint common people Nomansland, called doldrums, unpleasant measles complaints; made restless, cross, disagreeable. Even little better, he weak enjoy anything, lay day long his sofa, fidgetting his nurse extremely--while, her intense terror lest he might die, she fidgetted still more. At last, seeing he really getting well, she left himself--which he glad of, spite his dulness dreariness. There he lay, alone, quite alone. [Illustration: "_Even little better, he weak enjoy anything, lay day long his sofa, fidgetting his nurse extremely._"] Now irritable fit came him, he longed get something, go somewhere--would liked imitate his white kitten--jump tower run away, taking chance whatever might happen. Only one thing, alas! likely happen; kitten, he remembered, four active legs, he---- "I wonder godmother meant she looked legs sighed bitterly? I wonder I cannot walk straight steady like nurse--only I would not like her great noisy, clumping shoes. Still, would nice move quickly--perhaps fly, like bird, like string birds I saw day skimming across sky--one other." These passage-birds--the living creatures ever crossed lonely plain; he much interested them, wondering whence came whither going. "How nice must bird. If legs good, cannot one wings? People wings die--perhaps: I wish I dead, I do. I tired, tired; nobody cares me. Nobody ever care me, except perhaps godmother. Godmother, dear, quite forsaken me?" He stretched wearily, gathered up, dropped his head upon his hands; he so, he felt somebody kiss back his neck, turning, found he resting, sofa-pillows, warm shoulder--that little old woman clothed grey. How glad he see her! How he looked her kind eyes, felt her hands, see she real alive! put his arms round her neck, kissed her he would never done kissing! "Stop, stop!" cried she, pretending smothered, "I see forgotten teachings. Kissing good thing--in moderation. Only, let breath speak one word." "A dozen!" he said. "Well, then, tell happened since I saw you--or rather, since saw me, quite different thing." "Nothing happened--nothing ever happen me," answered Prince dolefully. "And dull, boy?" "So dull, I thinking whether I could jump bottom tower like white kitten." "Do not that, white kitten." "I wish I were!--I wish I anything I am!" "And cannot make different, I either. You must content stay are." The little old woman said this--very firmly, gently, too--with her arms round his neck, her lips his forehead. It first time boy ever heard one talk like this, he looked surprise--but pain, her sweet manner softened hardness her words. "Now, prince--for prince, must behave such--let us see do; much I you, show yourself. Where travelling-cloak?" Prince Dolor blushed extremely. "I--I put away cupboard; I suppose still." "You never used it; dislike it?" He hesitated, wishing impolite. "Do not think it is--just little old shabby, prince?" The old woman laughed--long loud, though sweetly. "Prince, indeed! Why, princes world craved it, could not get it, unless I gave them. Old shabby! It is valuable thing imaginable! Very ever it; I thought I would give you, because--because different people." "Am I?" said Prince, looked first curiosity, sort anxiety, his godmother's face, sad grave, slow tears beginning steal down. She touched his poor little legs. "These like little boys." "Indeed!--my nurse never told that." "Very likely not. But time told; I tell you, I love you." "Tell what, dear godmother?" "That never able walk, run, jump, play--that life quite different people's lives: may happy life that. Do afraid." "I afraid," said boy; he turned pale, his lips began quiver, though he actually cry--he old that, and, perhaps, proud. Though wholly comprehending, he began dimly guess his godmother meant. He never seen real live boys, he seen pictures them; running jumping; he admired tried hard imitate, always failed. Now he began understand he failed, he always fail--that, fact, he like little boys; use his wishing did, play played, even he play with. His separate life, he must find new work new pleasures himself. The sense _the inevitable_, grown-up people call it--that cannot things want be, are, must learn bear make best them--this lesson, everybody learn soon late--came, alas! sadly soon, poor boy. He fought while, then, quite overcome, turned sobbed bitterly his godmother's arms. She comforted him--I know how, except love always comforts; she whispered him, her sweet, strong, cheerful voice--"Never mind!" "No, I do not think I mind--that is, I _won't_ mind," replied he, catching courage her tone speaking like man, though he still mere boy. "That right, prince!--that like prince. Now know exactly are; let us put shoulders wheel and----" "We Hopeless Tower" (this name, name), "and wheel put shoulders to," said child sadly. "You little matter-of-fact goose! Well godmother called----" "What?" he eagerly asked. "Stuff-and-nonsense." "Stuff-and-nonsense! What funny name!" "Some people give me, intimate friends. These call me--never mind what," added old woman, soft twinkle her eyes. "So know me, know well, may give name please; does not matter. But I godmother, child. I godchildren; I love dearly, find greatest blessing world." "I well believe it," cried little lame Prince, forgot his troubles looking her--as her figure dilated, her eyes grew lustrous stars, her raiment brightened, whole room seemed filled her beautiful beneficent presence like light. He could looked her ever--half love, half awe; she suddenly dwindled little old woman grey, malicious twinkle her eyes, asked travelling-cloak. "Bring rubbish cupboard, shake dust it, quick!" said she Prince Dolor, hung his head, rather ashamed. "Spread floor, wait till split closes edges turn like rim round. Then go open sky-light--mind, I say _open skylight_--set middle it, like frog water-lily leaf; say 'Abracadabra, dum dum dum,' and--see happen!" The prince burst fit laughing. It seemed exceedingly silly; he wondered wise old woman like his godmother talk nonsense. "Stuff-and-nonsense, mean," said she, answering, his great alarm, his unspoken thoughts. "Did I tell people called name? Never mind; does not harm me." And she laughed--her merry laugh--as child-like she prince's age instead her own, whatever might be. She certainly extraordinary old woman. "Believe not, does not matter," said she. "Here cloak: want go travelling it, say _Abracadabra, dum dum dum_; want come back again, say _Abracadabra, tum tum ti_. That is all; good-bye." A puff pleasant air passing him, making feel moment quite strong well, Prince conscious of. His extraordinary godmother gone. "Really now, rosy Royal Highness's cheeks grown! You seem got well already," said nurse, entering room. "I think I have," replied Prince gently--he felt kindly gently even his grim nurse. "And let dinner, go sewing usual." The instant she gone, however, taking her plates dishes, first time since his illness he satisfactorily cleared, Prince Dolor sprang his sofa, one two his frog-like jumps, graceful convenient, he reached cupboard he kept his toys, looked everywhere his travelling-cloak. Alas! there. While he ill doldrums, his nurse, thinking good opportunity putting things rights, made grand clearance his "rubbish," she considered it: his beloved headless horses, broken carts, sheep without feet, birds without wings--all treasures his baby days, he could bear part with. Though he seldom played now, he liked feel there. They gone! travelling-cloak. He sat floor, looking empty shelves, beautifully clean tidy, burst sobbing his heart would break. But quietly--always quietly. He never let his nurse hear cry. She laughed him, he felt she would laugh now. "And fault," he cried. "I ought taken better care godmother's gift. O, godmother, forgive me! I will never careless again. I do not know cloak exactly, I sure something precious. Help find again. Oh, do not let stolen me--do not, please!" "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed silvery voice. "Why, travelling-cloak one thing world nobody steal. It use anybody except owner. Open eyes, prince, see shall see." His dear old godmother, he thought, turned eagerly round. But no; he beheld, lying corner room, dust cobwebs, his precious travelling-cloak. Prince Dolor darted towards it, tumbling several times way,--as he often tumble, poor boy! pick again, never complaining. Snatching his breast, he hugged kissed it, cobwebs all, something alive. Then he began unrolling it, wondering minute would happen. But happen curious I must leave another chapter. CHAPTER V. If reader, big little, wonder whether meaning story, deeper ordinary fairy tale, I is. But I hidden carefully smaller people, many larger folk, never find out, meantime book may read straight on, like "Cinderella," "Blue-Beard," "Hop-of-my Thumb," interest has, amusement may bring. Having said this, I return Prince Dolor, little lame boy many may think exceedingly pitied. But seen he sat patiently untying his wonderful cloak, done tight perplexing parcel, using skilfully his deft little hands, knitting his brows firm determination, his eyes glistened pleasure, energy, eager anticipation--if beheld thus, might changed opinion. When see people suffering unfortunate, feel sorry them; see bravely bearing sufferings, making best misfortunes, quite different feeling. We respect, admire them. One respect admire even little child. When Prince Dolor patiently untied knots, remarkable thing happened. The cloak began undo itself. Slowly unfolding, laid carpet, flat ironed; split joined little sharp crick-crack, rim turned round till breast-high; meantime cloak grown grown, become quite large enough one person sit it, comfortable boat. The Prince watched rather anxiously; extraordinary, say frightening thing. However, he coward, thorough boy, who, he like boys, would doubtless grown daring adventurous--a soldier, sailor, like. As was, he could show his courage morally, physically, afraid nothing, boldly his narrow powers do. And I sure way he showed real valour he six pairs proper legs. He said himself, "What goose I am! As dear godmother would ever given anything hurt me. Here goes!" So, one his active leaps, he sprang right middle cloak, he squatted down, wrapping his arms tight round his knees, shook little his heart beat fast. But he sat, steady silent, waiting might happen next. Nothing happen, he began think nothing would, feel rather disappointed, he recollected words he told repeat--"Abracadabra, dum, dum, dum!" He repeated them, laughing while, seemed nonsense. And then--and then---- Now, I do not expect anybody believe I going relate, though good many wise people believed good many sillier things. And seeing's believing, I never saw it, I cannot expected implicitly believe myself, except sort way; yet truth it--for people. The cloak rose, slowly steadily, first inches, gradually higher higher, till nearly touched skylight. Prince Dolor's head actually bumped glass, would done so, he crouched down, crying, "Oh, please do not hurt me!" melancholy voice. Then he suddenly remembered his godmother's express command--"Open skylight!" Regaining his courage once, without moment's delay, he lifted his head began searching bolt, cloak meanwhile remaining perfectly still, balanced air. But minute window opened, sailed--right clear fresh air, nothing cloudless blue. Prince Dolor never felt delicious sensation before! I understand it. Cannot you? Did never think, watching rooks going home singly pairs, oaring way across calm evening sky, till vanish like black dots misty grey, pleasant must feel there, quite noise din world, able hear see everything below, yet troubled nothing teased one--all alone, perfectly content. Something like happiness little lame Prince he got Hopeless Tower, found first time pure open air, sky earth below. True, nothing earth sky; houses, trees, rivers, mountains, seas--not beast ground, bird air. But even level plain looked beautiful; glorious arch sky, little young moon sitting west like baby queen. And evening breeze sweet fresh, kissed like his godmother's kisses; by-and-by stars came out, first two three, quantities--quantities! that, he began count them, he utterly bewildered. [Illustration: "_By-and-by stars came out, first two three, quantities!_"] By time, however, cool breeze become cold, mist gathered, he had, he said, outdoor clothes, poor Prince Dolor comfortable. The dews fell damp his curls--he began shiver. "Perhaps I better go home," thought he. But how?--For his excitement words his godmother told use slipped his memory. They little different first, slight difference importance lay. As he repeated his "Abracadabra," trying ever many syllables it, cloak went faster faster, skimming dusky empty air. The poor little Prince began feel frightened. What his wonderful travelling-cloak keep thus travelling, perhaps world's end, carrying poor, tired, hungry boy, who, all, beginning think something pleasant supper bed? "Dear godmother," he cried pitifully, "do help me! Tell I will never forget again." Instantly words came rushing his head--"Abracadabra, tum, tum, ti!" Was it? Ah, yes!--for cloak began turn slowly. He repeated charm again, distinctly firmly, gave gentle dip, like nod satisfaction, immediately started back, fast ever, direction tower. He reached skylight, he found exactly he left it, slipped in, cloak all, easily he got out. He scarcely reached floor, still sitting middle his travelling-cloak--like frog water-lily leaf, his godmother expressed it--when he heard his nurse's voice outside. "Bless us! become Royal Highness time? To sit stupidly window till quite dark, leave skylight open too. Prince! thinking of? You silliest boy I ever knew." "Am I?" said he absently, never heeding her crossness; his anxiety lest she might find anything. She would clever person done so. The instant Prince Dolor got it, cloak folded tiniest possible parcel, tied knots, rolled accord farthest darkest corner room. If nurse seen it, she did not, she would taken mere bundle rubbish worth noticing. Shutting skylight angry bang, she brought supper lit candles, her usual unhappy expression countenance. But Prince Dolor hardly saw it; he saw, hid corner nobody else would see it, his wonderful travelling-cloak. And though his supper particularly nice, he ate heartily, scarcely hearing word his nurse's grumbling, to-night seemed taken place her sullen silence. [Illustration: "_She brought supper lit candles, her usual unhappy expression ... he saw his wonderful travelling-cloak._" _Page 58._] "Poor woman!" he thought, he paused minute listen look her, quiet, happy eyes, like his mother's. "Poor woman! _she_ has not got travelling-cloak!" And he left alone last, crept his little bed, he lay awake good while, watching he called his "sky-garden," planted stars, like flowers, his chief thought was, "I must early to-morrow morning get lessons done, I will go travelling world beautiful cloak." So, next day, he opened his eyes sun, went good heart his lessons. They hitherto chief amusement his dull life; now, I afraid, he found also little dull. But he tried good--I do not say Prince Dolor always good, he generally tried be--and his mind went wandering dark dusty corner lay his precious treasure, he resolutely called back again. "For," he said, "how ashamed godmother would I grew stupid boy." But instant lessons done, he alone empty room, he crept across floor, undid shabby little bundle, his fingers trembling eagerness, climbed chair, thence table, unbar skylight--he forgot nothing now--said his magic charm, away window, children say, "in minutes less time!" Nobody missed him. He accustomed sit quietly always, his nurse, though next room, perceived difference. And besides, she might gone dozen times, would same; she never could found his absence. For think clever godmother did? She took quantity moonshine, equally convenient material, made image, she set window-sill reading, table drawing, looked like Prince Dolor, common observer would never guessed deception; even boy would puzzled know image himself. And happy little fellow away, floating air his magic cloak, seeing sorts wonderful things--or seemed wonderful him, hitherto seen nothing all. First, flowers grew plain, which, whenever cloak came near enough, he strained his eyes look at; tiny, beautiful--white saxifrage, yellow lotus, ground-thistles, purple bright, many others names I know. No Prince Dolor, though he tried find recalling pictures he seen them. But he far off; though pleasant enough admire brilliant patches colour, still he would liked examine all. He was, little girl I know said playfellow, "a _examining_ boy." "I wonder," he thought, "whether I could see better pair glasses like nurse reads with, takes care of. How I would take care too! I pair!" Immediately he felt something queer hard fixing bridge his nose. It pair prettiest gold spectacles ever seen; looking downwards, he found that, though ever high ground, he could see every minute blade grass, every tiny bud flower--nay, even insects walked them. "Thank you, thank you!" he cried gush gratitude--to anybody everybody, especially his dear godmother, he felt sure given new present. He amused ever long, his chin pressed rim cloak, gazing upon grass, every square foot mine wonders. Then, rest his eyes, he turned sky--the blue, bright, empty sky, he looked often seen nothing. Now, surely something. A long, black, wavy line, moving distance, chance, clouds move apparently, deliberately, alive. He might seen before--he almost thought he had; he could tell was. Looking his spectacles, he discovered really alive; long string birds, flying one other, wings moving steadily heads pointed one direction, steadily little ship, guided invisibly unerring helm. "They must passage-birds flying seawards!" cried boy, read little them, great talent putting two two together finding he could. "Oh, I like see quite close, know come from, whither going! How I wish I knew everything world!" A silly speech even "examining" little boy make; because, grow older, know, find know. And Prince Dolor blushed he said it, hoped nobody heard him. Apparently somebody had, however; cloak gave sudden bound forward, presently he found high air, middle band ærial travellers, magic cloak travel on--nothing except wings. Yet were, making fearless way sky. Prince Dolor looked them, one glided past him; looked him--those pretty swallows, changing necks bright eyes--as wondering meet mid-air extraordinary sort bird. [Illustration: "_They looked ... wondering meet mid-air extraordinary sort bird._" _Page 62._] "Oh, I wish I going you, lovely creatures!" cried boy. "I am getting tired dull plain, dreary lonely tower. I want see world! Pretty swallows, dear swallows! tell looks like--the beautiful, wonderful world!" But swallows flew past him--steadily, slowly, pursuing course inside little head mariner's compass, guide safe land sea, direct place desired go. The boy looked envy. For long time he followed his eyes faint wavy black line floated away, sometimes changing curves little, never deviating settled course, till vanished entirely sight. Then he settled centre cloak, feeling quite sad lonely. "I think I will go home," said he, repeated his "Abracadabra, tum, tum, ti!" rather heavy heart. The he had, he wanted; always one everything one wants--at least, exact minute one craves it; even though one prince, powerful beneficent godmother. He like vex her calling her, telling her unhappy he was, spite her goodness; he kept his trouble himself, went back his lonely tower, spent three days silent melancholy without even attempting another journey his travelling-cloak. CHAPTER VI. The fourth day happened deaf-mute paid his accustomed visit, Prince Dolor's spirits rose. They always did, he got new books, which, relieve his conscience, King Nomansland regularly sent his nephew; many new toys also, though latter disregarded now. "Toys indeed! I am big boy," said Prince disdain, would scarcely condescend mount rocking-horse, come, somehow other--I cannot expected explain things exactly--packed back other, great black horse, stood fed contentedly bottom tower. Prince Dolor leaned looked it, thought grand must get upon back--this grand live steed--and ride away, like pictures knights. "Suppose I knight," he said himself; "then I obliged ride see world." But he kept thoughts himself, sat still, devouring his new books till he come end all. It repast unlike Barmecide's feast read "Arabian Nights," consisted elegant empty dishes, supper Sancho Panza "Don Quixote," where, minute smoking dishes came table, physician waved his hand taken away. Thus, almost ordinary delights boy-life taken away from, rather never given to, poor little Prince. "I wonder," he would sometimes think--"I wonder feels like back horse, galloping away, holding reins carriage, tearing across country, jumping ditch, running race, I read see pictures. What lot things I like do! But first, I like go see world. I will try." Apparently his godmother's plan always let try, try hard, he gained anything. This day knots tied his travelling-cloak usually troublesome, he full half hour he got open air, found floating merrily top tower. Hitherto, his journeys he never let go sight home, dreary building, all, home--he remembered other; he felt sick look his tower, round smooth walls level battlements. "Off go!" cried he, cloak stirred slight slow motion, waiting his orders. "Anywhere--anywhere, I away here, world." As he spoke, cloak, seized suddenly new idea, bounded forward went skimming air, faster fastest railway train. "Gee-up, gee-up!" cried Prince Dolor great excitement. "This good riding race." And he patted cloak horse--that is, way he supposed horses ought patted; tossed his head back meet fresh breeze, pulled his coat-collar his hat down, he felt wind grow keener colder, colder anything he ever known. "What matter though?" said he. "I am boy, boys ought mind anything." Still, his good-will, by-and-by he began shiver exceedingly; also, he come away without his dinner, he grew frightfully hungry. And add everything, sunshiny day changed rain, high up, midst clouds, he got soaked minutes. "Shall I turn back?" meditated he. "Suppose I say 'Abracadabra?'" Here he stopped, already cloak gave obedient lurch, expecting sent home immediately. "No--I cannot--I cannot go back! I must go forward see world. But oh! I shabbiest old rug shelter rain, driest morsel bread cheese, keep starving! Still, I do not much mind; I am prince, ought able stand anything. Hold on, cloak, we will make best it." It curious circumstance, sooner he said he felt stealing his knees something warm soft; fact, beautiful bearskin, folded round quite naturally, cuddled closely he cub kind old mother-bear owned it. Then feeling his pocket, suddenly stuck marvellous way, he found, exactly bread cheese, even sandwiches, packet delicious food he ever tasted. It meat, pudding, combination both, served excellently both. He ate his dinner greatest gusto imaginable, till he grew thirsty he know do. "Could not I one drop water, did not trouble much, kindest godmothers." For he really thought want beyond her power supply. All water supplied Hopeless Tower pumped difficulty, deep artesian well--there things known Nomansland--which made foot it. But around, miles upon miles, desolate plain perfectly dry. And it, high air, could he expect find well, get even drop water? He forgot one thing--the rain. While he spoke, came another wild burst, clouds poured passion crying, wetting certainly, leaving behind, large glass vessel he never noticed before, enough water quench thirst two three boys least. And fresh, pure--as water clouds always is, catch soot city chimneys defilements--that he drank it, every drop, greatest delight content. Also, soon empty, rain filled again, he able wash his face hands refresh exceedingly. Then sun came dried time. After he curled bearskin rug, though he determined wide-awake boy imaginable, exceedingly snug warm comfortable, Prince Dolor condescended shut his eyes, one minute. The next minute he sound asleep. When he awoke, he found floating country quite unlike anything he ever seen before. Yet nothing children see every day never notice it--a pretty country landscape, like England, Scotland, France, land choose name. It particular features--nothing grand lovely--was simply pretty, nothing more; yet Prince Dolor, never gone beyond his lonely tower level plain, appeared charming sight imaginable. First, river. It came tumbling hillside, frothing foaming, playing hide-and-seek among rocks, bursting noisy fun like child, bury deep still pools. Afterwards went steadily while, like good grown-up person, till came another big rock, misbehaved extremely. It turned cataract went tumbling over, fashion made Prince--who never seen water before, except his bath his drinking-cup--clap his hands delight. "It active, alive! I like things active alive!" cried he, watched shimmering dancing, whirling leaping, till, windings vagaries, settled respectable stream. After went along, deep quiet, flowing steadily on, till reached large lake, slipped, ended course. [Illustration: "_After windings vagaries, settled respectable stream._"] All boy saw, either his naked eye, his gold spectacles. He saw also picture, beautiful silent, many things, struck wonder, especially grove trees. Only think, lived his age (which he know, he know his birthday) never seen trees! As he floated oaks, seemed him--trunk, branches, leaves--the curious sight imaginable. "If I could get nearer, touch them," said he, immediately obedient cloak ducked down; Prince Dolor made snatch topmost twig tallest tree, caught bunch leaves his hand. Just bunch green leaves--such see myriads; watching bud, grow, fall, kicking along ground worth nothing. Yet, wonderful are--every one little different. I do not suppose could ever find two leaves exactly alike, form, colour, size--no could find two faces alike, two characters exactly same. The plan world infinite similarity yet infinite variety. Prince Dolor examined his leaves greatest curiosity--and also little caterpillar he found walking one them. He coaxed take additional walk his finger, greatest dignity decorum, it, Mr. Caterpillar, important individual existence. It amused long time; sudden gust wind blew overboard, leaves all, he felt quite disconsolate. "Still, must many live creatures world besides caterpillars. I like see them." The cloak gave little dip down, say "All right, Prince," bore across oak forest long fertile valley--called Scotland strath, England weald--but call tongue Nomansland I know. It made cornfields, pasturefields, lanes, hedges, brooks, ponds. Also, Prince desired see, quantity living creatures, wild tame. Cows horses, lambs sheep, fed meadows; pigs fowls walked farmyards; and, lonelier places, hares scudded, rabbits burrowed, pheasants partridges, many smaller birds, inhabited fields woods. [Illustration: "_It made cornfields, pasturefields, lanes, hedges, brooks, ponds._"] [Illustration: "_In Prince desired see, quantity living creatures._"] Through his wonderful spectacles Prince could see everything; but, I said, silent picture; he high catch anything except faint murmur, aroused his anxiety hear more. "I good two pairs eyes," he thought. "I wonder godmother would give second pair ears." Scarcely he spoken, he found lying his lap curious little parcel, done silvery paper. And contained--what think? Actually, pair silver ears, which, he tried on, fitted exactly his own, he hardly felt them, except difference made his hearing. There something listen daily never notice. I mean sounds visible world, animate inanimate. Winds blowing, waters flowing, trees stirring, insects whirring (dear me! I quite unconsciously writing rhyme), various cries birds beasts--lowing cattle, bleating sheep, grunting pigs, cackling hens--all infinite discords somehow make beautiful harmony. We hear this, accustomed think nothing it; Prince Dolor, lived his days dead silence Hopeless Tower, heard first time. And oh! seen his face. He listened, listened, he could never done listening. And he looked looked, he could gaze enough. Above all, motion animals delighted him: cows walking, horses galloping, little lambs calves running races across meadows, treat watch--he always quiet. But, creatures four legs, he two, difference strike painfully. Still, by-and-by, fashion children--and, I fear, many big people too--he began want something he had, something would quite fresh new. "Godmother," he said, begun believe that, whether he saw her not, he could always speak her full confidence she would hear him--"Godmother, creatures I like exceedingly--but I like better see creature like myself. Could not show one little boy?" There sigh behind him--it might wind--and cloak remained long balanced motionless air, he half afraid his godmother forgotten him, offended asking much. Suddenly, shrill whistle startled him, even his silver ears, looking downwards, he saw start behind bush common, something-- Neither sheep, horse, cow--nothing upon four legs. This creature two; long, straight, strong. And lithe active body, curly head black hair set upon shoulders. It boy, shepherdboy, Prince's age--but, oh! different. Not he ugly boy--though his face almost red his hands, his shaggy hair matted like backs his sheep. He rather nice-looking lad; seemed bright, healthy, good-tempered--"jolly" would word, I sure one elegant language Nomansland--that little Prince watched great admiration. "Might he come play me? I would drop ground him, fetch here. Oh, nice would I little boy play me!" But cloak, usually obedient his wishes, disobeyed now. There evidently things his godmother either could would give. The cloak hung stationary, high air, never attempting descend. The shepherd lad evidently took large bird and, shading his eyes, looked it, making Prince's heart beat fast. However, nothing ensued. The boy turned round, long, loud whistle--seemingly his usual way expressing his feelings. He could make thing exactly--it rather mysterious affair, trouble much--_he_ "examining" boy. Then, stretching himself, he evidently half asleep, he began flopping his shoulders his arms, wake warm himself; his dog, rough collie, guarding sheep meanwhile, began jump upon him, barking delight. "Down Snap, down! Stop that, I will thrash you," Prince heard say; though rough hard voice queer pronunciation difficult make words out. "Hollo! Let us warm race." They started together, boy dog--barking shouting, till doubtful made noise ran fastest. A regular steeple-chase was: first across level common, greatly disturbing quiet sheep; tearing away across country, scrambling hedges, leaping ditches, tumbling ploughed fields. They seem anything run for--but it, them, mere pleasure motion. And pleasure seemed! To dog course, scarcely less boy. How he skimmed along ground--his cheeks glowing, his hair flying, his legs--oh, pair legs he had! Prince Dolor watched great intentness, state excitement almost equal runner himself--for while. Then sweet pale face grew trifle paler, lips began quiver eyes fill. "How nice must run like that!" he said softly, thinking never--no, never world--would he able same. Now he understood his godmother meant she gave his travelling-cloak, he heard sigh--he sure hers--when he asked see "just one little boy." "I think I rather look again," said poor little Prince, drawing back centre his cloak, resuming his favourite posture, sitting like Turk, his arms wrapped round his feeble, useless legs. "You are good me," he said, patting mournfully. "You never good me. I wonder I all; I wonder I born all, since I grow like little boys. _Why_ not?" A question, strange, sad, yet often occurring form other, world--as find, children, older--that even he put his mother she could answered it, answer many difficult things, simply saying, "I do not know." There much know, cannot understand--we big folks, little ones. We accept accept anything parents may tell you, even though do not yet see reason it. You may time exactly tell you, content wait. Prince Dolor sat good thus, appeared good while, many thoughts came went his poor young mind--thoughts great bitterness, which, little though he was, seemed make grow years older minutes. Then he fancied cloak began rock gently fro, soothing kind motion, he somebody is arms: somebody speak, loved comforted without need words; deceiving false encouragement hope, making see plain hard truth, hardness, thus letting quietly face it, till grew softened down, seem nearly dreadful all. Through dreary silence blankness, he placed he could see nothing sky, taken his silver ears, well his gold spectacles--what use either he legs walk run?--up rose delicious sound. You heard hundreds times, children, I. When I child I thought nothing sweet; I think still. It song skylark, mounting higher higher ground, till came close Prince Dolor could distinguish quivering wings tiny body, almost tiny contain gush music. "O, beautiful, beautiful bird!" cried he; "I dearly like take cuddle you. That is, I could--if I dared." But he hesitated. The little brown creature loud heavenly voice almost made afraid. Nevertheless, also made happy; he watched listened--so absorbed he forgot regret pain, forgot everything world except little lark. It soared soared, he wondering would soar sight, world he gone, suddenly closed wings, larks do, mean drop ground. But, instead dropping ground, dropped right little boy's breast. What felicity! If would stay! A tiny soft thing fondle kiss, sing day long, his playfellow companion, tame tender, rest world wild bird air. What pride, delight! To something nobody else had--something his own. As travelling-cloak travelled on, he little heeded where, lark still stayed, nestled his bosom, hopped his hand his shoulder, kissed dainty beak, loved him, Prince Dolor forgot his grief, entirely happy. But he got sight Hopeless Tower, painful thought struck him. "My pretty bird, I you? If I take room shut there, you, wild skylark air, become you? I used this, not. You miserable, suppose nurse find you--she cannot bear sound singing? Besides, I remember her telling nicest thing she ever ate her life lark pie!" The little boy shivered thought. And, though merry lark immediately broke loudest carol, saying derisively he defied anybody eat _him_--still Prince Dolor uneasy. In another minute he made his mind. "No, bird, nothing dreadful shall happen I help it; I would rather without altogether. Yes, I will try. Fly away, darling, beautiful! Good-bye, merry, merry bird." Opening his two caressing hands, which, protection, he folded it, he let lark go. It lingered minute, perching rim cloak, looking eyes almost human tenderness; away flew, far blue sky. It bird. But, time after, Prince Dolor eaten his supper--somewhat drearily, except thought he could possibly sup lark pie now--and gone quietly bed, old familiar little bed, he accustomed sleep, lie awake contentedly thinking--suddenly he heard outside window little faint carol--faint cheerful--cheerful, even though middle night. The dear little lark! flown away all. And truly extraordinary bird, for, unlike ordinary larks, kept hovering tower silence darkness night, outside window roof. Whenever he listened moment, he heard singing still. He went sleep happy king. CHAPTER VII. "Happy king." How far kings happy I cannot say, could Prince Dolor, though he king himself. But he remembered nothing it, nobody tell him, except his nurse, forbidden upon pain death let know anything his dead parents, king his uncle, or, indeed, part his history. Sometimes he speculated himself, whether he father mother little boys had, like, he never seen them. But, knowing nothing them, he miss them--only twice, reading pretty stories little children mothers, helped difficulty, comforted sick, he, feeling ill dull lonely, wondered become his mother, she never came see him. Then, his history lessons, course, he read kings princes, governments different countries, events happened there. And though he faintly took this, still he take in, little, worried his young brain it, perplexed his nurse questions, she returned sharp mysterious answers, set thinking more. He plenty time thinking. After his last journey travelling-cloak, journey given much pain, his desire see world somehow faded away. He contented reading his books, looking tower windows, listening his beloved little lark, come home day, never left again. True, kept way; though his nurse sometimes dimly heard it, said, "What horrid noise outside?" she never got faintest chance making lark pie. Prince Dolor his pet himself, though he seldom saw it, he knew near him, he caught continually, odd hours day, even night, fragments delicious song. All winter--so far ever difference summer winter Hopeless Tower--the little bird cheered amused him. He scarcely needed anything more--not even his travelling-cloak, lay bundled unnoticed corner, tied innumerable knots. Nor his godmother come near him. It seemed she given treasures left alone--to use them, lose them, apply them, misapply them, according his choice. That children, grow big children, old enough distinguish right wrong, old forced either. Prince Dolor quite big boy. Not tall--alas! he never could that, his poor little shrunken legs; use, encumbrance. But he stout strong, great sturdy shoulders, muscular arms, upon he could swing almost like monkey. As compensation his useless lower limbs, nature given extra strength activity. His face, too, handsome; thinner, firmer, manly; still sweet face his childhood--his mother's face. How his mother would liked look him! Perhaps she did--who knows! The boy stupid boy either. He could learn almost anything he chose--and he choose, half battle. He never gave his lessons till he learnt all--never thought punishment he work them, cost deal trouble sometimes. "But," thought he, "men work, must grand man;--a prince too; I fancy princes work harder anybody--except kings. The princes I read generally turn kings. I wonder"--the boy always wondering--"Nurse"--and one day he startled her sudden question--"tell me--shall I ever king?" The woman stood, perplexed beyond expression. So long time passed since her crime--if crime--and her sentence, she seldom thought either. Even her punishment--to shut life Hopeless Tower--she gradually got used to. Used also little lame prince, her charge--whom first she hated, though she carefully everything keep alive, since upon her life hung. But latterly she ceased hate him, and, sort way, almost loved him--at least, enough sorry him--an innocent child, imprisoned till he grew old man--and became dull, worn-out creature like herself. Sometimes, watching him, she felt sorry even herself; then, seeing she looked less miserable ugly woman, he shrink her usual. He now. "Nurse--dear nurse," said he, "I do not mean vex you, tell me--what king? shall I ever one?" When she began think less herself child, woman's courage increased. The idea came her--what harm would be, even he know his history? Perhaps he ought know it--for various ups downs, usurpations, revolutions, restorations Nomansland, countries. Something might happen--who could tell? Changes might occur. Possibly crown would even yet set upon pretty, fair curls--which she began think prettier ever she saw imaginary coronet upon them. She sat down, considering whether her oath, never "say word" Prince Dolor himself, would broken, she take pencil write told. A mere quibble--a mean, miserable quibble. But she miserable woman, pitied scorned. After long doubt, great trepidation, she put her finger her lips, taking Prince's slate--with sponge tied it, ready rub writing minute--she wrote-- "You king." [Illustration: "_After long doubt ... she put her finger her lips, taking Prince's slate ... wrote--'You king.'_"] Prince Dolor started. His face grew pale, flushed over; his eyes glistened; he held erect. Lame he was, anybody could see he born king. "Hush!" said his nurse, he beginning speak. And then, terribly frightened while--people done wrong always frightened--she wrote hurried sentences his history. How his parents died--his uncle usurped his throne, sent end his days lonely tower. "I, too," added she, bursting tears. "Unless, indeed, could get world, fight rights like man. And fight also, prince, I may die desolate place." "Poor old nurse!" said boy compassionately. For somehow, boy he was, he heard he born king, he felt like man--like king--who could afford tender he strong. He scarcely slept night, even though he heard his little lark singing sunrise, he barely listened it. Things serious important taken possession his mind. "Suppose," thought he, "I she says, go world, matter hurts me--the world people, active people, active boy I saw. They might laugh me--poor helpless creature I am; still I might show I could something. At rate, I might go see anything do. Godmother, help me!" It long since he asked her help, he hardly surprised he got answer--only little lark outside window sang louder louder, sun rose, flooding room light. Prince Dolor sprang bed, began dressing hard work, he used it--he always accustomed depend upon his nurse everything. "But I must learn independent," thought he. "Fancy king dressed like baby!" So he best he could--awkwardly cheerily--and he leaped corner lay his travelling-cloak, untied before, watched unrolling itself--which rapidly, hearty good-will, quite tired idleness. So Prince Dolor--or felt he was. He jumped middle it, said his charm, skylight immediately. "Good-bye, pretty lark!" he shouted, he passed wing, still warbling carol newly-risen sun. "You pleasure, delight; I must go work. Sing old nurse till I come back again. Perhaps she will hear you--perhaps she will not--but her good same. Good-bye!" But, cloak hung irresolute air, he suddenly remembered he determined go--indeed, he know, nobody tell him. "Godmother," he cried, much perplexity, "you know I want--at least, I hope do, I hardly myself--take I ought go; show whatever I ought see--never mind I like see," sudden idea came his mind he might see many painful disagreeable things. But journey pleasure--as before. He baby now, nothing play--big boys always play. Nor men neither--they work. Thus much Prince Dolor knew--though little more. And cloak started off, travelling faster he ever known do--through sky-land cloud-land, freezing mountain-tops, desolate stretches forest, smiling cultivated plains, great lakes seemed almost shoreless sea--he often rather frightened. But he crouched down, silent quiet; use making fuss? and, wrapping his bear-skin, waited happen. After time he heard murmur distance, increasing till grew like hum gigantic hive bees. And, stretching his chin rim his cloak, Prince Dolor saw--far, far him, yet his gold spectacles silver ears on, he could distinctly hear see--What? Most us sometime visited great metropolis--have wandered network streets--lost crowds people--looked tall rows houses, grand public buildings, churches squares. Also, perhaps, peeped miserable little back alleys, dirty children play gutters day half night--or men reel tipsy women fight--where even young boys go picking pockets, nobody tell wrong, except policeman; he simply takes prison. And wretchedness close behind grandeur--like two sides leaf book. An awful sight large city, seen anyhow, anywhere. But, suppose see upper air; where, eyes ears open, could take everything once? What would look like? How would feel it? I hardly know myself. Do you? Prince Dolor need king--that is, boy kingly nature--to able stand sight without utterly overcome. But he much bewildered--as bewildered blind person suddenly made see. He gazed city him, put his hand his eyes. "I cannot bear look it, beautiful--so dreadful. And I do not understand it--not one bit. There nobody tell it. I wish I somebody speak to." "Do you? Then pray speak me. I always considered good conversation." The voice squeaked reply excellent imitation human one, though came bird. No lark time, however, great black white creature flew cloak, began walking round round edge dignified stride, one foot other, like unfeathered biped could name. "I have not honour acquaintance, sir," said boy politely. [Illustration: "_One half people seemed happy busy._" _Page 90._] [Illustration: "_The half wretched miserable._" _Page 90._] "Madam, please. I mother bird, name Mag, I shall happy tell everything want know. For I know great deal; I enjoy talking. My family great antiquity; built palace hundreds--that say, dozens years. I intimately acquainted King, Queen, little princes princesses--also maids honour, inhabitants city. I talk good deal, I always talk sense, I dare say I exceedingly useful poor little ignorant boy like you." "I prince," said gently. "All right. And I magpie. You find respectable bird." "I doubt it," polite answer--though he thought his mind Mag must good opinion herself. But she lady stranger, so, course, he civil her. She settled herself his elbow, began chatter away, pointing one skinny claw she balanced herself other, every object interest,--evidently believing, doubt inhabitants did, capital world like great metropolis Nomansland. I seen it, therefore cannot describe it, take upon trust, suppose be, like every fine city, finest city ever built. "Mag" said so--and course she knew. Nevertheless, things surprised Prince Dolor--and, he said, he could understand all. One half people seemed happy busy--hurrying full streets, driving lazily along parks grand carriages, half wretched miserable. "Cannot world made little level? I would try I king." "But you are king: little goose boy," returned magpie loftily. "And I am explain things, show them. Shall I show royal palace?" It magnificent palace. It terraces gardens, battlements towers. It extended acres ground, rooms enough accommodate half city. Its windows looked directions, none particular view--except small one, high towards roof, looked Beautiful Mountains. But since Queen died there, closed, boarded up, indeed, magpie said. It little inconvenient, nobody cared live it. Besides, lower apartments, view, magnificent--worthy inhabited his Majesty King. [Illustration: "_It terraces gardens, battlements towers ... rooms enough accommodate half city._"] [Illustration: "_Its windows looked directions ... except small one, high towards roof, looked Beautiful Mountains._"] "I like see King," said Prince Dolor. But followed important I must take another chapter tell in. CHAPTER VIII. What, I wonder, would people's idea king? What Prince Dolor's? Perhaps splendid personage, crown his head, sceptre his hand, sitting throne, judging people. Always right, never wrong--"The king wrong" law laid olden times. Never cross, tired, sick, suffering; perfectly handsome well-dressed, calm good-tempered, ready see hear everybody, discourteous nobody; things always going well him, nothing unpleasant ever happening. This, probably, Prince Dolor expected see. And he see? But I must tell he saw it. "Ah," said magpie, "no levée to-day. The King ill, though his Majesty wish generally known--it would inconvenient. He cannot see you, perhaps might like go take look him, way I often do? It amusing." Amusing, indeed! The Prince much excited talk much. Was he going see King his uncle, succeeded his father, dethroned himself; stepped pleasant things he, Prince Dolor, ought had, shut desolate tower? What he like, great, bad, clever man? Had he got things he wanted, another ought had? And he enjoy them? "Nobody knows," answered magpie, she sitting inside Prince's heart, instead top his shoulder. "He king, that is enough. For rest nobody knows." As she spoke Mag flew palace roof, cloak rested, settling great stacks chimneys comfortably ground. She pecked tiles her beak--truly she wonderful bird--and immediately little hole opened, sort door, could seen distinctly chamber below. [Illustration: "_She pecked tiles her beak ... little hole opened ... 'Now look in, Prince. Make haste, I must soon shut again.'_" _Page 92._] "Now look in, prince. Make haste, I must soon shut again." But boy hesitated. "Is not rude?--will not think us--intruding?" "O dear no! there is hole like every palace; dozens holes, indeed. Everybody knows it, nobody speaks it. Intrusion! Why, though Royal family supposed live shut behind stone walls ever thick, world knows live glass house everybody see them, throw stone them. Now, pop knees, take peep his Majesty." His Majesty! The Prince gazed eagerly down, large room, largest room he ever beheld, furniture hangings grander anything he could ever imagined. A stray sunbeam, coming crevice darkened windows, struck across carpet, loveliest carpet ever woven--just like bed flowers walk over; nobody walked it; room perfectly empty silent. "Where King?" asked puzzled boy. "There," said Mag, pointing one wrinkled claw magnificent bed, large enough contain six people. In centre it, visible silken counterpane--quite straight still--with head lace pillow--lay small figure, something like waxwork, fast asleep--very fast asleep! There quantity sparkling rings tiny yellow hands, curled little, helplessly, like baby's, outside coverlet; eyes shut, nose looked sharp thin, long grey beard hid mouth, lay breast. A sight ugly, frightening, solemn quiet. And silent--two little flies buzzing curtains bed, audible sound. "Is King?" whispered Prince Dolor. "Yes," replied bird. He angry--furiously angry; ever since he knew his uncle taken crown, sent him, poor little helpless child, shut life, he dead. Many times boy felt if, king he was, he like strike him, great, strong, wicked man. Why, might well struck baby! How helpless he lay! his eyes shut, his idle hands folded: work do, bad good. "What matter him?" asked Prince again. "He dead," said Magpie croak. No, least use angry now. On contrary, Prince felt almost sorry him, except he looked peaceful, his cares rest. And dead? So, even kings died? "Well, well, he had not easy life, folk say, his grandeur. Perhaps he glad over. Good-bye, Majesty." With another cheerful tap her beak, Mistress Mag shut little door tiles, Prince Dolor's first last sight his uncle ended. He sat centre his travelling-cloak silent thoughtful. "What shall now?" said Magpie. "There is nothing much done his Majesty, except fine funeral, I shall certainly go see. All world will. He interested world exceedingly he alive, he ought he is dead--just more. And since he cannot hear me, I may well say that, whole, his Majesty much better dead alive--if get somebody his place. There will row city presently. Suppose float again, see all. At safe distance, though. It fun." "What fun?" "A revolution." Whether anybody except magpie would called "fun," I do not know, certainly remarkable scene. As soon Cathedral bell began toll, minute guns fire, announcing kingdom without king, people gathered crowds, stopping street corners talk together. The murmur rose shout, shout roar. When Prince Dolor, quietly floating upper air, caught sound different opposite cries, seemed whole city gone mad together. "Long live King!" "The King dead--down King!" "Down crown, King too!" "Hurrah Republic!" "Hurrah Government all." Such shouts travelled travelling-cloak. And began--oh, scene! When children grown men women--or before--you hear read books called revolutions--earnestly I trust neither I may ever see one. But happened, may happen again, countries beside Nomansland, wicked kings helped make people wicked too, unrighteous nation sprung rulers equally bad; or, without either causes, restless country fancied change better change all. For me, I do not like changes, unless pretty sure good. And good come absolute evil--the horrible evil went night Prince Dolor's eyes--soldiers shooting people hundreds streets, scaffolds erected, heads dropping off--houses burnt, women children murdered--this I understand. But things find history, children, must by-and-by judge right wrong them, far anybody ever judge. Prince Dolor saw all. Things happened fast one another quite confused his faculties. "Oh, let go home," he cried last, stopping his ears shutting his eyes; "only let go home!" even his lonely tower seemed home, dreariness silence absolute paradise this. "Good-bye, then," said magpie, flapping her wings. She chatting incessantly day night, actually thus long Prince Dolor hovering city, neither eating sleeping, terrible things happening his eyes. "You have enough, I suppose, seeing world?" "Oh, I have--I have!" cried Prince shudder. "That is, till next time. All right, Royal Highness. You do not know me, I know you. We may meet sometime." She looked her clear piercing eyes, sharp enough see everything, seemed changed bird's eyes human eyes, eyes his godmother, he seen ever long. But minute afterwards she became bird, screech chatter spread her wings flew away. Prince Dolor fell kind swoon, utter misery, bewilderment, exhaustion, he awoke he found his room--alone quiet--with dawn breaking, long rim yellow light horizon glimmering window panes. CHAPTER IX. When Prince Dolor sat bed, trying remember he was, whither he been, he seen day before, he perceived his room empty. Generally, his nurse rather worried breaking his slumbers, coming "setting things rights," she called it. Now, dust lay thick upon chairs tables; harsh voice heard scold getting immediately--which, I sorry say, boy always do. For he enjoyed lying still, thinking lazily, everything nothing, that, he tried hard it, he would certainly become like celebrated "Two little men Who lay bed till clock struck ten." It striking ten now, still nurse seen. He rather relieved first, he felt tired; besides he stretched his arm, he found his dismay he gone bed his clothes. Very uncomfortable he felt, course; little frightened. Especially he began call call again, nobody answered. Often he used think nice would get rid his nurse live tower himself--like sort monarch, able everything he liked, leave undone he want do; seemed really happened, he like all. "Nurse--dear nurse--please come back!" he called out. "Come back, I best boy land." And she come back, nothing silence answered his lamentable call, he nearly began cry. "This will not do," he said last, dashing tears his eyes. "It is like baby, I am big boy--shall man day. What happened, I wonder? I will go see." He sprang bed--not his feet, alas! his poor little weak knees, crawled room room. All four chambers deserted--not forlorn untidy, everything seemed done his comfort--the breakfast dinner-things laid, food spread order. He might live "like prince," proverb is, several days. But place entirely forsaken--there evidently creature solitary tower. A great fear came upon poor boy. Lonely his life been, he never known absolutely alone. A kind despair seized him--no violent anger terror, sort patient desolation. "What world I do?" thought he, sat middle floor, half inclined believe would better give entirely, lay die. This feeling, however, last long, he young strong, I said before, nature courageous boy. There came his head, somehow other, proverb his nurse taught him--the people Nomansland fond proverbs:-- "For every evil sun There remedy, there is none; If one, try find it-- If is not, never mind it." "I wonder--is remedy now, could I find it?" cried Prince, jumping looking window. No help there. He saw broad bleak sunshiny plain--that is, first. But, by-and-by, circle mud surrounded base tower he perceived distinctly marks horse's feet, spot deaf-mute accustomed tie his great black charger, he ascended, lay remains bundle hay feed corn. "Yes, that is it. He come gone, taking nurse away him. Poor nurse! glad she would go!" That Prince Dolor's first thought. His second--was not natural?--was passionate indignation her cruelty--at cruelty world towards him--a poor little helpless boy. Then he determined--forsaken he was--to try hold last, die long he could possibly help it. Anyhow, would easier die world, among terrible doings he beheld. From midst which, suddenly struck him, deaf-mute come--contrived somehow make nurse understand king dead, she need fear going back capital, grand revolution, everything turned upside down. So, course she gone. "I hope she will enjoy it, miserable woman--if do not cut her head too." And kind remorse smote feeling bitterly towards her, years she taken care him--grudgingly, perhaps, coldly; still, she taken care him, even last: for, I said, his four rooms tidy possible, his meals laid out, he might trouble could helped. "Possibly she mean cruel. I will not judge her," said he. And afterwards he glad he determined. For second time he tried dress himself, everything he could himself--even sweeping hearth putting coals. "It is funny thing prince do," said he laughing. "But godmother said princes need never mind anything." And he thought little his godmother. Not summoning her, asking her help him--she evidently left help himself, he determined try his best it, proud independent boy--but he remembered her, tenderly regretfully, even she little hard upon him--poor, forlorn boy he was! But he seemed seen learned much within last days, he scarcely felt like boy, man--until he went bed night. When I child, I used often think nice would live little house self--a house built high tree, far away forest, half way hillside,--so deliciously alone independent. Not lesson learn--but no! I always liked learning lessons. Anyhow, choose lessons I liked best, many books read dolls play ever I wanted: all, free rest, nobody teaze, trouble, scold me, would charming. For I lonely little thing, liked quietness--as many children do; children, sometimes grown-up people even, cannot always understand. And I understand Prince Dolor. After his first despair, he merely comfortable, actually happy his solitude, everything himself, enjoying everything himself--until bedtime. Then, he like all. No more, I suppose, children would liked imaginary house tree, sufficient company. But prince bear it--and he bear it--like prince: fully five days. All time he got morning went bed night, without spoken creature, or, indeed, heard single sound. For even his little lark silent: his travelling-cloak, either he never thought it, else spirited away--for he made use it, attempted so. A strange existence was, five lonely days. He never entirely forgot it. It threw back upon himself, himself--in way us learn grow up, better it--but somewhat hard learning. On sixth day, Prince Dolor strange composure his look, he grave, thin, white. He nearly come end his provisions--and happen next? Get tower he could not; ladder deaf-mute used always carried away again; been, could poor boy used it? And even he slung flung down, miraculous chance came alive foot tower could he run away? Fate hard him, seemed. He made his mind die. Not he wished die; contrary, great deal he wished live do; he must die, he must. Dying seem dreadful; even lie quiet like his uncle, he entirely forgiven now, neither miserable naughty more, escape horrible things he seen going outside palace, awful place called "the world." "It is great deal nicer here," said poor little Prince, collected his pretty things round him: his favourite pictures, he thought he like near he died; his books toys--no, he ceased care toys now; he liked he done child. And he sat calm patient, like king his castle, waiting end. "Still, I wish I done something first--something worth doing, somebody might remember by," thought he. "Suppose I grown man, work do, people care for, useful busy liked me, perhaps even forgot I lame. Then, would nice live, I think." A tear came little fellow's eyes, he listened intently dead silence hopeful sound. Was one--was his little lark, he almost forgotten? No, nothing half sweet. But really something--something came nearer nearer, mistaking it. It sound trumpet, one great silver trumpets admired Nomansland. Not pleasant music, bold, grand, inspiring. As he listened boy seemed recall many things slipped his memory years, nerve whatever might going happen. What happened this. The poor condemned woman wicked woman all. Perhaps her courage wholly disinterested, she done heroic thing. As soon she heard death burial King, changes taking place country, daring idea came her head--to set upon throne Nomansland rightful heir. Thereupon she persuaded deaf-mute take her away him, galloped like wind city city, spreading everywhere news Prince Dolor's death burial invention concocted his wicked uncle--that he alive well, noblest young Prince ever born. It bold stroke, succeeded. The country, weary, perhaps, late King's harsh rule, yet glad save horrors last days, still horrors rule all, particular interest young princes, jumped idea Prince, son late good King beloved Queen Dolorez. "Hurrah Prince Dolor! Let Prince Dolor sovereign!" rang end end kingdom. Everybody tried remember dear baby he was--how like his mother, sweet kind, his father, finest looking king ever reigned. Nobody remembered his lameness--or, did, passed matter consequence. They determined reign them, boy he was--perhaps he boy, since case great nobles thought able liked country. Accordingly, fickleness confined people Nomansland, sooner late King laid his grave pronounced usurper; turned his family palace, left empty reception new sovereign, went fetch great rejoicing; select body lords, gentlemen, soldiers, travelling night day solemn procession country, reached Hopeless Tower. There found Prince, sitting calmly floor--deadly pale indeed, he expected quite different end this, resolved he die, die courageously, like prince king. But hailed prince king, explained matters stood, went knees him, offering crown (on velvet cushion, four golden tassels, nearly big his head)--small though he lame, lameness courtiers pretended notice--there came glow his face, dignity his demeanour, he became beautiful, king-like. "Yes," he said, "if desire it, I king. And I best make people happy." Then arose, inside outside tower, shout never yet heard across lonely plain. Prince Dolor shrank little deafening sound. "How shall I able rule great people? You forget, lords, I little boy still." "Not little," respectful answer. "We searched records, found Royal Highness--your Majesty, I mean--is precisely fifteen years old." "Am I?" said Prince Dolor; his first thought thoroughly childish pleasure he birthday, whole nation keep it. Then he remembered his childish days done. He monarch now. Even his nurse, whom, moment he saw her, he held his hand, kissed reverently, called ceremoniously "his Majesty King." "A king must always king, I suppose," said he half sadly, when, ceremonies over, he left ten minutes, put his boy's clothes, re-attired magnificent robes, he conveyed away his tower Royal Palace. He could take nothing him; indeed, he soon saw that, however politely spoke, would allow take anything. If he king, he must give his old life ever. So he looked tender farewell his old books, old toys, furniture he knew well, familiar plain levelness, ugly yet pleasant, simply familiar. "It new life new world," said he himself; "but I will remember old things still. And, oh! I go, I could see dear old godmother." While he spoke, he laid bed minute two, rather tired his grandeur, confused noise trumpets kept playing incessantly below. He gazed, half sadly, skylight, whence came pouring stream sun-rays, innumerable motes floating there, like bridge thrown heaven earth. Sliding it, she made air, came little old woman grey. [Illustration: "_There came pouring stream sun-rays ... like bridge ... Sliding it, she made air, came little old woman grey._"] So beautiful looked she--old she was--that Prince Dolor first quite startled apparition. Then he held his arms eager delight. "O, godmother, forsaken me!" "Not all, son. You may seen me, I seen you, many time." "How?" "O, never mind. I turn anything I please, know. And I bear-skin rug, crystal goblet--and sometimes I changed inanimate animate nature, put feathers, made comfortable bird." "Ha!" laughed Prince, new light breaking upon him, he caught infection her tone, lively mischievous. "Ha, ha! lark, instance?" "Or magpie," answered she, capital imitation Mistress Mag's croaky voice. "Do suppose I always sentimental never funny?--If anything makes happy, gay grave, do not think likely come old godmother?" "I believe that," said boy tenderly, holding his arms. They clasped one another close embrace. Suddenly Prince Dolor looked anxious. "You leave I king? Otherwise, I rather king all. Promise never forsake me?" The little old woman laughed gaily. "Forsake you? impossible. But possible may forsake me. Not probable though. Your mother never did, she queen. The sweetest queen world lady Dolorez." "Tell her," said boy eagerly. "As I get older I think I understand more. Do tell me." "Not now. You could not hear trumpets shouting. But come palace, ask long-closed upper room, looks upon Beautiful Mountains; open take own. Whenever go there, always find me, talk together sorts things." "And mother?" The little old woman nodded--and kept nodding smiling herself many times, boy repeated sweet words he never known understood--"my mother--my mother." "Now I must go," said she, trumpets blared louder louder, shouts people showed would endure delay. "Good-bye, Good-bye! Open window I fly." Prince Dolor repeated gaily musical rhyme--but tried hold his godmother fast. Vain, vain!--for moment knocking heard his door, sun went behind cloud, bright stream dancing motes vanished, little old woman them--he knew where. So Prince Dolor quitted his tower--which he entered mournfully ignominiously, little helpless baby carried deaf-mute's arms--quitted great King Nomansland. [Illustration: "_So Prince Dolor quitted his tower ... quitted great King Nomansland._" _Page 111._] The thing he took away something insignificant, none lords, gentlemen, soldiers escorted triumphant splendour, could possibly notice it--a tiny bundle, he found lying floor bridge sunbeams rested. At he pounced upon it, thrust secretly his bosom, dwindled small proportions, might taken mere chest-comforter--a bit flannel--or old pocket-handkerchief! It his travelling-cloak. CHAPTER X. Did Prince Dolor become great king? Was he, though little boy, "the father his people," kings ought be? Did his reign last long--long happy?--and principal events it, chronicled history Nomansland? Why, I answer questions, I write another book. And I am tired, children, tired--as grown-up people sometimes are; though always play. (Besides, I small person belonging me, who, though she likes extremely listen word-of-mouth story book, grumbles much writing it, run house clapping her hands joy mamma told her nearly finished. But neither there.) I related, well I could, history Prince Dolor, history Nomansland I yet unacquainted. If anybody knows it, perhaps he she kindly write another book. But mine done. However, I sure, Prince Dolor made excellent king. Nobody ever anything less well, even commonest duty common daily life, godmother little old woman clothed grey, whose name is--well, I leave guess. Nor, I think, anybody less good, less capable work enjoyment life, little unhappy his youth, Prince been. I cannot take upon say he always happy now--who is?--or he cares; show person quite free them! But, whenever people worried bothered him--as sometimes, state etiquette, state squabbles, like, setting pulling neighbours--he would take refuge upper room looked Beautiful Mountains and, laying his head his godmother's shoulder, become calmed rest. Also, she helped difficulty occurred--for never wise old woman. When people Nomansland raised alarm--as sometimes did--for people exist without little fault-finding?--and began cry out, "Unhappy nation whose king child," she would say gently, "You child. Accept fact. Be humble--be teachable. Lean upon wisdom others till gained own." He so. He learned take advice attempting give it, obey he could righteously command. He assembled round good wise his kingdom--laid affairs them, guided opinions he maturely formed his own. This he did, sooner anybody would imagined, know his godmother his travelling-cloak--two secret blessings, which, though many guessed at, nobody quite understood. Nor understand he loved little upper room, except his mother's room, window which, people remembered now, she used sit hours watching Beautiful Mountains. Out window he used fly--not often; he grew older, labours state prevented frequent use his travelling-cloak; still he use sometimes. Only less his pleasure amusement see something, investigate something, good country. But he prized his godmother's gift dearly ever. It comfort his vexations; enhancement his joys. It made almost forget his lameness--which never cured. However, cruel things foreboded happen. His misfortune heavy one all. It proved much less inconvenience, even himself, feared. A council eminent surgeons mechanicians invented wonderful pair crutches, help which, though he never walked easily gracefully, he manage walk, quite independent. And love his people bore never heard sound his crutch marble palace-floors without leap heart, knew good coming whenever he approached them. Thus, though he never walked processions, never reviewed his troops mounted magnificent charger, things make show monarch much appreciated, he able duties great many pleasures his rank. When he held his levées, standing, seated throne, ingeniously contrived hide his infirmity, people thronged greet him; he drove city streets, shouts followed wherever he went--every countenance brightened he passed, his own, perhaps, brightest all. [Illustration: "_When he drove city streets, shouts followed wherever he went._" _Page 116._] First, because, accepting his affliction inevitable, he took patiently; second, because, brave man, he bore bravely; trying forget himself, live himself, people. Therefore people grew love well, I think hundreds his subjects might found almost ready die poor lame King. He never gave queen. When implored choose one, he replied his country his bride, he desired other. But, perhaps, real reason he shrank change; wife world would found perfect, lovable, tender his weaknesses, his beautiful old godmother. His four-and-twenty godfathers godmothers, many still alive, crowded round soon he ascended throne. He civil all, adopted none names given him, keeping one he always known, though almost lost meaning; King Dolor one happiest cheerfullest men alive. He good many things, however, unlike men kings, little astonished his subjects. First, he pardoned condemned woman his nurse, ordained henceforward thing punishment death Nomansland. All capital criminals sent perpetual imprisonment Hopeless Tower, plain round it, could harm anybody, might time little good, woman done. Another surprise he shortly afterwards gave nation. He recalled his uncle's family, fled away terror another country, restored honours own. By-and-by he chose eldest son his eldest cousin (who dead year), educated royal palace, heir throne. This little prince quiet, unobtrusive boy, everybody wondered King's choosing him, many more; he grew fine young fellow, good brave, agreed King judged wisely they. "Not lame prince neither," his Majesty observed one day, watching affectionately; he best runner, highest leaper, keenest active sportsman country. "One cannot make oneself, one sometimes help little making somebody else. It well." This said, his great lords ladies, good old woman--his first homely nurse--whom he sought far wide, last found, her cottage among Beautiful Mountains. He sent her visit year, treated her great honour she died. He equally kind, though somewhat less tender, his nurse, who, receiving her pardon, returned her native town grew great lady, I hope good one. But she grand personage now, little faults she show. [Illustration: "_But she grand personage now, little faults she show._" _Page 118. Thus King Dolor's reign passed, year year, long prosperous. Whether he happy--"as happy king"--is question human decide. But I think he was, he power making everybody happy, too; also he his godmother's godson, could shut her whenever he liked, quiet little room, view Beautiful Mountains, nobody else ever saw cared see. They far off, city lay low. But were, time. No change ever came them; I think, day throughout his long reign, King would sooner lost his crown lost sight Beautiful Mountains. In course time, little prince, his cousin, grown tall young man, capable duties man, his Majesty one extraordinary acts ever known sovereign beloved his people prosperous his reign. He announced he wished invest his heir royal purple--at rate, time--while he went away distant journey, whither he long desired go. Everybody marvelled, nobody opposed him. Who could oppose good King, young king now? And, besides, nation great admiration young Regent--and, possibly, lurking pleasure change. So fixed day, people would hold, assembled great square capital, see young Prince installed solemnly his new duties, undertaking his new vows. He fine young fellow; tall straight poplar tree, frank handsome face--a great deal handsomer King, people said, others thought differently. However, his Majesty sat his throne, his grey hair falling underneath his crown, wrinkles showing spite his smile, something his countenance made his people, even shouted, regard tenderness mixed awe. [Illustration: "_All people ... assembled see young Prince installed solemnly his new duties undertaking his new vows._" _Page 119._] He lifted his thin, slender hand, came silence vast crowd immediately. Then he spoke, his accustomed way, using grand words, saying he say simplest fashion, though clearness struck ears like first song bird dusk morning. "My people, I tired: I want rest. I long reign, done much work--at least, much I able do. Many might done better I--but none better will. Now I leave others. I tired, tired. Let go home." There rose murmur--of content discontent none could well tell; died again, assembly listened silently more. "I anxious you--my people--my children," continued king. "You prosperous peace. I leave good hands. The Prince Regent fitter king I." "No, no, no!" rose universal shout--and sometimes found fault shouted louder anybody. But he seemed he heard not. "Yes, yes," said he, soon tumult little subsided; his voice sounded firm clear; old people, boasted seen child, declared his face took sudden change, grew young sweet little Prince Dolor. "Yes, I must go. It time go. Remember sometimes, people, I loved well. And I going long way, I think I shall come back more." He drew little bundle his breast pocket--a bundle nobody ever seen before. It small shabby-looking, tied many knots, untied instant. With joyful countenance, he muttered half-intelligible words. Then, suddenly even nearest his Majesty could tell came about, King away--away--floating right air--upon something, knew what, except appeared safe pleasant wings bird. And sprang bird--a dear little lark, rising whence one could say, since larks usually build nests pavement city squares. But was, real lark, singing far heads, louder clearer, joyful, vanished blue sky. Shading eyes, straining ears, astonished people stood, whole vision disappeared like speck clouds--the rosy clouds overhung Beautiful Mountains. Then guessed see beloved king more. Well-beloved he was, he always somewhat mystery them, he remained. But went home, and, accepting new monarch, obeyed faithfully his cousin's sake. King Dolor never beheld heard his country. But good he done lasted years years; he long missed deeply mourned--at least, far anybody could mourn one gone happy journey. Whither he went, went him, impossible say. But I believe his godmother took him, his travelling-cloak, Beautiful Mountains. What he there, he now, tell? I cannot. But one thing I quite sure of, that, wherever he is, he perfectly happy. And so, I think him, I. THE END. The author little book, Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, woman modest, sweet, wholesome story itself. She lived England, her writings endeared her people world. Some American ladies went call upon her her home, Wildwood Cottage, Hampstead, near London, describe her wearing black silk gown plain linen collar, her brown hair drawn smoothly back open brow, her face, gracious winning unusual degree, bearing look one tasted sorrow. This she already well-known writer, her place literature hard faithful work; probably she dream, even then, she would come recognized as, next Dickens, widely-read novelist her time. She born April 20, 1826, Stoke-upon-Trent, one chief manufacturing towns Staffordshire, England. Staffordshire central county England, many curious interesting features. It forms sloping base long chain hills, countless ages sea, sometimes covering land driven away upheaval great body earth stone, worn grit limestone rock clay. Did know clay mud made washing away rocks? Just think many hundreds years took make little ball clay model with! Well, people lived country found out, eighteen hundred years ago, could mould clay pots basins, even could make things grow it; dug clay, shaped hands, baked sun, making jars, bowls, useful things sold farmers exchange food. About time came marching thickly wooded land, companies Roman soldiers, took clay bowls wanted use, showed potters make better ones. They also compelled make floors, roofs, wall ornaments clay baked hot ovens, called kilns. Much old Roman pottery was, course, broken lost, still, ever go there, would find pieces banks little rivers brooks near clay pits, pieces thousand years old. Because full clay--dark blue clay, red yellow ochres, used coloring painting, well red black chalk--the country seems made potteries. Besides this, used always plenty wood keep kilns hot, great forest covered nearly land. This continuation Forest Arden, read day, well Sherwood Forest, sheltered Robin Hood his merry men.--Have heard yet?--Later, better fuel needed, two great coal fields discovered underlying county, one twenty miles long two broad. Here, then, perfectly prepared his work, natural greatest potter modern times, one greatest times, born--Josiah Wedgwood, lived many years town Mrs. Craik born. He loved make dishes jars kinds perfect possible, shut long illness he studied chemistry arithmetic needed his trade. In years hard labor close study he mastered his trade he made science art. He, other, turned county one busiest places world, thousands men work morning till night supply whole world every sort thing made clay. Perhaps bottom plates home may find printed words "Staffordshire, England." Before Wedgwood's time--in 1653, accurate--Stoke-upon-Trent small group thatched houses two pot-works, gathered around ancient parish church. In 1762, thirty-two years Wedgwood's birth, population 8,000, 7,000 employed, one way another, pottery trade. The whole country-side black smoke many factories. At one time, potters used salt glaze ware--that is, put bright polish it--they used open huge ovens every Saturday morning, hours eight twelve, cast salt. It would melt, run surface clay jugs things inside, leave smooth, shining surface. If let salt water, strong salt, boil old crock mother's, fire making stove red-hot, see works. Indeed, accidental boiling-over sort salt-glaze discovered. On Saturdays, salt cast kilns, made great clouds smoke vapor, filling streets houses, spreading far country, heavy travelers town lost way, persons street ran other. Here lived, preached, argued, laid law, brilliant, enthusiastic Irishman, named Thomas Mulock, father woman wrote book. He minister, one agree ministers around him. He warm, eager nature, temper match, second twenty-two children must exercised his early childhood power domineering made Lord Byron nickname "Muley Mulock." By name he known half Europe, he much loved admired, moved circle Byron, Scott, Southey, Wordsworth. From him, Mrs. Craik undoubtedly inherited her gifts writer. Her mother daughter Mr. Mellard, tanner member Reverend Thomas Mulock's congregation. She one three sisters used talk young minister wall separated gardens. There legend he went white wedding, his shoes white satin; likely picturesque bit gossip, kept alive fact Mr. Mulock quite romantic enough independent enough done thing happened strike his fancy. His wife frail little woman, troubles soon beset her husband account his strong, new opinions, hard her bear, also way he, like hot-blooded Irishman, sure he right rest world wrong, marched straight thick theological fight might going on. Dinah, last, although merely inexperienced girl, persuaded her mother go her London, seek little peace quiet, leaving father fight his battles alone country place he found--or made--so full strife. This tremendous responsibility young girl means speak ordinarily good education, given young ladies girls' schools days. At school she seems great favorite, described always center bevy girls, hung round her lovingly, she prophesied wonderful things. She always sure great abilities, seemed quite unconscious she herself gifted all, would remembered forgotten. Even she came London, she made friends among girls, spite her unceasing exacting work, seems always time enjoy make enjoy her. She twenty years old when, 1846, she went London, undertook main support her mother two young brothers soon joined them. She everything her pen could find do, writing stories fashion books periodicals, satisfaction, finally, knowing she succeeded caring her aged mother end her life. Of two brothers, elder, Thomas, Jr., true son his father, took part act rebellion studying Royal Academy. His father sided principals school approved son's expelled, his heart aching, probably, he he thought his duty. The son's heart, turn, sore he must thought unloving conduct father's part. At rate, he decided soon go Australia, and, he board ship, fell quay killed. This heavy blow brave young sister, left younger brother. He musician photographer mean rank time persons thought photography art. Though he never proved support her, always leaning her motherly care getting many scrapes she pull he nevertheless joy his sister's life. In London Miss Mulock made friends whose assistance, later, worth great deal her. She published, 1849, her first novel, _The Ogilvies_, brought her recognition, made men women real power world letters seek her out. When knew her personally, her simple cordiality, friendliness, and, all, her thorough goodness heart, made her warm friends. When she found herself able take cottage--the "Wildwood Cottage" already spoken of--she quickly gathered around her brightest best people great city. From time on, her books came steadily great numbers. In all, she wrote forty-six works, including many novels, essays, two three volumes poetry. The greatest her novels _John Halifax, Gentleman_, considered many best story English middle-class life ever written. This novel translated French, German, Italian, Greek, Russian, still one frequently called books public libraries. Her poems, _Douglas, Douglas, Tender True_, _Philip My King_, known wherever English spoken. There interesting story connected latter poem. Philip Bourke Marston, boy refers, son one Miss Mulock's London friends, Westland Marston, famous dramatic poet critic. When his little son born, August 13, 1850, he asked Miss Mulock Philip's godmother, traces her deep affection gifted child found among her writings. _A Hero_ written him, him, evidently, lovely little poem, _A Child's Smile_, refers. The boy lost his sight three years old. The said much belladonna, given prevent scarlet fever. For many years enough sight remained enable him, his words, see "the three boughs waving wind, pageant sunset west, glimmer fire upon hearth." Shut thus inner world thought feeling, Philip indulged imaginative series wonderful adventures, long daydreams excited music. Perhaps his blindness, coupled his vivid imagination, reason beautiful poems he wrote he grew older show wonderfully vivid power portraying nature. When he saw tree-bough waving wind, he saw dimly his outward eyes, he sat dreaming afterward, became real bough likely become everyday, hearty boy saw many trees, many branches, he hardly noticed all. It must great comfort godmother Miss Mulock--a real fairy godmother, could weave magic spells interesting stories, heal aches his poor heart sweet little poems. It Wildwood Cottage Miss Mulock formed close acquaintance George Lillie Craik finally led her marriage him. Mr. Craik met serious railroad accident near her house, she promptly gave him, she staying friend near by; long days convalescence learned know thoroughly. The marriage singularly happy. Mr. Craik man letters well publisher, every taste common. Their life together beautiful full deep peace. Although children own, adopted daughter, Dorothy, she _The Adventures Brownie_ written. It probably Mrs. Craik's devotion love her little book free self-consciousness, evidently written wholeheartedly "as told child." Mrs. Craik's death, took place 1887, was, like her life, full self-sacrificing affection obedience duty. She ill, beyond attacks heart-trouble one considered serious. By blessed chance, morning her last day earth, her husband took especially loving farewell her--so much Dorothy laughed him, Mrs. Craik, smiling happily, reminded her that, although long married, lovers still. It within weeks Dorothy's marriage sudden heart failure came, Mrs. Craik's one wish she might permitted live four weeks longer, her death might overshadow her daughter's wedding. She resigned even unselfish wish she saw God's will. The beauty her character, may supposed, quite much peculiar merit her writings, led Queen Victoria, always tried reward uprightness life well unusual skill art, bestow upon Mrs. Craik mark recognition her power. This small pension, although she often criticised keeping sum money she need, many less fortunate writers need it, she retained her right, use her conscience dictated. She set aside struggling authors would accept help queen's bounty would refuse her private funds. Other writers may brilliant profound Mrs. Craik, her tales simple goodness bring, sense rest relief reader, also new desire put goodness his daily life. In her stories Mrs. Craik makes goodness lovely really is. There sad things them, sadness always made sweet last courage patience kindliness.
