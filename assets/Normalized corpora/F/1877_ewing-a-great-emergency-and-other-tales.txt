 A GREAT EMERGENCY AND OTHER TALES. A GREAT EMERGENCY. CHAPTER I. RUPERT'S LECTURES—THE OLD YELLOW LEATHER BOOK. We happy—I, Rupert, Henrietta, Baby Cecil. The thing found fault lives events them. It particularly provoking, well prepared events—any events. Rupert prepared us. He found fat old book garret, bound yellow leather, end "Directions act presence mind emergency;" he gave lectures kitchen garden. Rupert twelve years old. He eldest. Then came Henrietta, I, last Baby Cecil, four. The day I nine years old, Rupert came nursery, holding his handsome head dignified air became well, I tried put nursery looking-glass, said me, "You quite old enough now, Charlie, learn whatever happens; every half-holiday, I playing cricket, I will teach presence mind near cucumber frame, you are punctual. I have put bench." I thanked warmly, next day he put his head nursery three of the clock afternoon, said—"The lecture." I jumped up, Henrietta. "It is girls," said Rupert; "women expected things there is danger." "_We_ take care _them_" said I, wondering mouth looked like Rupert's I spoke, whether manner impressed Henrietta much his impressed me. She sat said, "I stayed Friday afternoon, worked bed Saturday morning finish net." "Come along," said Rupert. "You know I am much obliged net; it is splendid one." "I will bring camp-stool there is room bench," said Henrietta cheerfully. "People never take camp-stools lectures," said Rupert, got cucumber frame found old plank, he raised inverted flower-pots, would held much larger audience he invited. Opposite rhubarb-pot, round top barrel resting it. On stood glass water. A delightful idea thrilled me, suggested imperfect remembrance lecture chemistry I attended. "Will experiments?" I whispered. "I think not," Henrietta replied. "There glasses water missionary meetings, experiments." Meanwhile Rupert turning leaves yellow leather book. To say truth, I think he rather nervous; virtue among us courage; dropping book twice, drinking water draught, he found his place, began. "_How act emergency_." "What is emergency?" I asked. I proud taught Rupert, anxious understand everything went along. "You should not interrupt," said Rupert, frowning. I inclined think he could answer question off-hand; though he looked cross then, referring book he answered me: "It is fire, drowning, apoplectic fit, anything sort." After explanation, he hurried on. If he said next came his head, whether he learned heart, I never knew. "There stronger sign good-breeding presence mind an—" "—apoplectic fit," I suggested. I giving keenest attention, Rupert hesitated, wind blown leaf many yellow leather book. "An _emergency_," he shouted, he found his place. "Now we will one time. The one to-day is—How act case drowning." To speak strict truth, I would rather thought drowning. I private horror neighbouring mill-dam, I much frightened spring-tide sea; cowardice indulgence one race, I screwed lips pricked ears learn duty unpleasant emergency drowning. "It does not mean drowned yourself," Rupert continued, "but another person drowned." The emergency undoubtedly easier, I gave cheerful attention Rupert began question us. "Supposing man drowned canal, brought ashore, people there, would him?" I completely nonplussed. "I felt quite sure I could nothing him, he would heavy; I felt equally certain answer Rupert expected, I left question Henrietta's readier wit. She knitted her thick eyebrows minutes, partly perplexity, partly sunshine reflected cucumber frame, said, "We bury vault; Charlie I _couldn't_ dig grave deep enough." I admired Henrietta's foresight, Rupert furious. "How _silly_ are!" he exclaimed, knocking top rhubarb-pot table empty glass his wrath. "Of course I do not mean dead man. I mean would bring partly drowned man life again?" "That was not _said_," cried Henrietta, tossing her head. "I let come lecture," grumbled Rupert bitterly, he stooped set his table right, "and way behave!" "I am sorry, Rupert dear!" said Henrietta. "Indeed, I mean best, I like lecture much!" "So I," I cried, "very, much!" And simultaneous impulse Henrietta I clapped hands vehemently. This restored Rupert's self-complacency, he bowed continued lecture. From learned drowned man turned his face let canal water run his mouth ears, his wet clothes got off, he made dry warm quickly possible, placed comfortable position, head shoulders slightly raised. All seemed quite feasible us. Henrietta dressed undressed lots dolls, I pictured filling hot-water bottle kitchen boiler air responsibility scare lighter-minded folk. But directions "restoring breathing" troubled sincere desire learn; even though Henrietta practised weeks afterwards upon me. I represented drowned man, she drew arms head "_inspiration_," counted "one, two;" doubled drove back "_expiration_;" tickled, I laughed, could feel sure would made drowned man breathe again. Meanwhile Rupert went course lectures, taught us behave event fire house, epidemic neighbourhood, bite mad dog, chase mad bull, broken limbs, runaway horses, chimney fire, young lady burning death. The lectures delightful themselves, furnished us whole set new games, Henrietta I zealously practised every emergency far nature things would allow. Covering faces wet cloths keep smoke, crept hands knees rescue fancy cripple imaginary burning house, current air Rupert told us found near floor. We fastened Baby Cecil's left leg his right pocket-handkerchiefs ankle, knee, pretending broken, must kept steady till could convey doctor. But unexplained reason Baby Cecil took offence game, I think he could howled roared louder worst real compound fractures. We done skilfully, greatly disgusted his unaccommodating spirit, his obstinate refusal put litter made Henrietta's stilts railway rug. We put Scotch terrier instead; one end litter gave way he fell out, sorry emergency fancy one, broken limbs really dependent upon well-meant efforts. There one thing Rupert's lectures disappointed me. His emergencies things happened daytime. Now I liked others know I ever afraid anything; but, really truly, I sometimes little frightened—not breaking leg, house fire, apoplectic fit, anything sort, but—of things dark. Every half-holiday I hoped would something robbers ghosts, never was. I think emergencies kind yellow leather book. On whole, I fancy Rupert found us satisfactory pupils, he never give lectures huff, though he sometimes threatened so, I asked stupid questions, Henrietta argued point. CHAPTER II. HENRIETTA—A FAMILY CHRONICLE—THE SCHOOL MIMIC—MY FIRST FIGHT. Henrietta often argued points, made Rupert angry. He said even she right, nothing it, girls ought not dispute discuss. And Henrietta argued point too. Rupert Henrietta often squabbled, always sort thing. I sure he would _very_ kind her she would agreed him, done he wanted. He often told gentlemen family always courteous women, I think he would done anything Henrietta she would everything herself. When wanted vex her much, used call her "Monkey," knew she liked like boy. She persuaded Mother let her her boots made like ours, she said roads rough muddy (which are). And found two her books her name written in, she put "Henry," Rupert wrote Etta it, "Monkey" that. So she tore leaves out. Her hair always coming curl. It dark, fell her eyes she used give her head peculiar shake toss, half fell wrong way, parting side, like partings. Nothing made Rupert angrier this. Henrietta good inventing things. Once she invented charade quite like story. Rupert much pleased it, he act hero, young cavalier old family—our family. He arrive inn; Henrietta made real old inn middle town, I innkeeper, Henrietta's pillow make fat, one Nurse's clean aprons. Then he ask spend night old Castle, Henrietta made real Castle, nine miles off, belonged cousin, though he never spoke us. And ghost appear. The ghost ancestor miniature Mother's bedroom. Henrietta ghost white sheet; her hair combed, burnt-cork moustache, she looked exactly like picture Rupert started she came in, stared; Mother said he acted splendidly. Henrietta wonderfully like picture. Much like Rupert ever was, rather vexed him, ancestor one bravest, his name Rupert. He rather vexed, too, she rode pony bare-backed kicked off. But I think pony fonder Henrietta, perhaps made easier her manage it. She used feed bits bread. It got her pocket. One things Henrietta could well Rupert cricket. Rupert one best players school. Henrietta used want play us home, she I play bit, breakfast, drying ground; Rupert said, I encouraged her unladylike, he would let come school matches. He said I might take choice, play either girls boys, both. But I thought would mean leave Henrietta lurch. So I told her I would stick her, Rupert actually forbidden me. He given choice, he always kept his word. But she would let me. She pretended she mind; I know she did, I could see afterwards she crying. However, she would play, Mother said she much rather she not, she afraid her getting hit ball. So settled it, I glad give going school matches. The school went old town grammar school. It famous one; expensive big public schools are, I believe lived town father's death, Mother rich. The grammar school large, sorts boys there—some gentlemen, tradesmen, farmers. Some boys dirty, horrid habits school, Rupert thirteen, I ten, he called council beginning half, lot boys formed committee, drew code honour, subscribed it. The code honour forbid lot things common school. Lying, cheating bargains, telling tales, bragging, bad language, code called "conduct unbecoming schoolfellows gentlemen." There lot rules it, too, clean nails, shirts, collars socks, things sort. If boy refused agree it, he fight Thomas Johnson. There could better person Rupert make code honour. We always taught honour watch-word family—dearer anything could gained lost, much dearer mere life. The motto arms came ancestor lost favour King refusing something his conscience he would rewarded. It "Honour honours." I remember man, iron-grey hair gold spectacles, came house father's death. I think he lawyer. He took lots snuff, Henrietta sneezed he kissed her, made her angry. He put Rupert front him, see us like father, I recall big pinch snuff he took, sound his voice saying "Be like father, boys! He good he gallant. And never lived honourable gentleman." Every one said same. We proud it, always boasted father new nursemaids, suitable hearer. I good deal annoyed one little maid, I told her, nursery tea, father honourable men, began cry her father, dead too, said he "just same; one twenty years he kept public-house, he never put much pinch salt beer, even gill water, unless evening fair-time, way keep men fighting give liquor could much harm." I much offended comparison _my_ father, officer gentleman rank, _her_ father, village publican; I like say, I think I wrong Jane right. If her father gave profit principle, he _was_ like father, like ancestor get motto from, like every honourable man, rank trade. Every time I boasted nursery father honourable, I always finished saying, he word Honourable his name, men old times used called "the Good" "the Lion Heart." The nursemaids quite believed it, I believed myself, till first week I went school. It makes hot remember I suffered week, long, afterwards. But I think cured bragging, mean ungentlemanly habit, telling everybody everything relations, weak-minded. The second day I there, one boys came said, mock ceremony politeness unfortunately took in, "If I mistaken, sir, esteemed lady, mother, Honourable?" He nearly five years older I; his name Weston; he thin cadaverous face, large nose, melancholy expression. I found afterwards he commonly called "the clown," considered boys London theatres surpass best professional comic actors he chose put forth his powers. I know then. I thought little formal, particularly courteous his manner, wishing behindhand politeness, I replied, much his style I could assume, "Certainly, sir. But father Honourable. My father, sir, honourable men." A slight spasm appeared pass Weston's face, he continued conversation sadder tone subject seemed require, I supposed due his recalling father dead. I confess need many leading inquiries draw narrative father's valour high principle, well noble sentiments conspicuous bravery marked family Saxon times, I well accustomed pour forth edification nursemaids. I proceeded far, new friend said, "Will not walk take seat?" It recreation time, boys playground. I special friend yet; Rupert stuck first day, left find level. I lingered near door came out, Weston joined me. He led back deserted school-room, sat together old black oak locker, bottom room. How well I remember scene! The dirty floor, empty benches, torn books sprinkled upon battered desks, dusty sunshine streaming in, white-faced clock wall opposite, hands moved almost incredible rapidity. But time ever fly fast people talking relations? Once mathematical master passed room. He glanced us curiously, Weston's face inscrutable, I—tracing surprise I secured old fine-mannered boy friend—held head, went narrative, fluently I could, show I parts justified Weston his preference. Tick, tack! went clock. Click, clack! went tongue. I fear quite half-an-hour must passed, big boy, open face, blue eyes, closely curling fair hair, burst in. On seeing us he exclaimed, "Hulloh!" stopped, I suspect obedience Weston's eyes, met his brief expressive gaze. Then Weston turned me. "Allow me," said he, "to introduce Mr. Thomas Johnson. He bears high character school, afford keenest satisfaction hear authentic account man esteemed father, whose character held imitation young gentlemen every establishment education youth." I blushed pride somewhat nervousness Mr. Thomas Johnson seated locker side begged (with less elegance expression first friend) I would "go ahead." I so. But minutes exhausted patience new hearer. When he kicked loose splinter wood satisfactorily leg one desks he began look clock, quickened pace remoter ancestors colonel regiment father ensign said him. I completed narrative last lawyer's remark, added, "and everybody says same. And _that_ father '_The Honourable_' his name, as—" &c., &c. I sooner uttered words Johnson started his seat, and, covering his face spotted silk pocket-handkerchief, rushed precipitately school-room. For one brief instant I fancied I heard choking laughter, I turned Weston he got too, look deep concern. "Mr. Johnson taken unwell, I fear," said he. "It peculiar kind spasm he subject. Excuse me!" He hurried anxiously his friend, I left alone school-room, boys shortly began pour. "Have alone, old fellow?" said Rupert kindly; "I hoped picked chum." "So I have," proud reply; "two chums." "I hope they are decent fellows," said Rupert. (He pestilent trick perpetually playing monitor, wet-blanketing good fellowship.) "You know best," said I pertly; "it is Weston Johnson. We have together long time." "Weston?" cried Rupert. "I hope goodness, Charlie, you have playing fool?" "You ask them," said I, tossing head I went proper place. For rest school-time I wore lofty Rupert anxious demeanour. Secure level higher friendship, I mean enough snub friendly advances one two younger boys. When went home night, I found mother much ready Rupert believe merits gained regard two upper boys. I exultingly happy. Not qualm disturbed waking dreams (after I bed) I retold family tale even greater length before, except I remembered one two incidents, excitement hour I forgotten school. I rather sorry, too, that, bound strictest injunctions Rupert promise, I able, ever casually, make new friends aware among advantages first cousin peer, one lived Castle. The Castle show place, I knew many schoolfellows glad enough take friends go shown housekeeper pictures _my_ ancestors. On point certainly advantage me. I seen pictures. Our cousin never called us, never asked us Castle, course could go father's old home like common holiday-making townspeople. I would rather say much next day. It must seem almost incredible I could failed see Weston Johnson making fun me; I confess want warnings I made fool myself. I looked forward going school equal measures delight dread; pride ambition longed first step life, Rupert filled wholesome awe stringent etiquette, withering ridicule, unsparing severities. However, his anxiety make modest circumspect, I think he rather over-painted picture, I got first day without bullied, made creditable friends second, I began think Rupert's experience school life must due lack social conversational powers I seemed better endowed. And Weston's acting would deceived wiser head mine. And nursemaids always listened willingly! As happened, Rupert unwell next day could go school. He obviously afraid going alone, I fears. My self-satisfaction undone till playtime. Then boy dispersed games. They gathered round Weston playground, confident air I also made way his side. As he turned his face I undeceived. Weston accustomed—at times suited his caprice his resources—to give exhibitions his genius mimicry rest boys. I heard Rupert entertainments, much admired school. They commonly consisted funny dialogues various worthies place well known everybody, made Weston's audience able judge accuracy his imitations. From head-master idiot blew organ bellows church, every inhabitant place gifted recognizable peculiarity personated one time another wit school. The favourite imitation supposed one Dialogues Plato, "omitted strange over-sight edition graces library learned respected doctor," Weston would say profound gravity. The Dialogue Dr. Jessop Silly Billy—the idiot already referred to—and apposite Latin quotations head-master his pompous English, inapposite replies organ-blower, given local dialect Billy's peculiar jabber, supposed form masterpiece mimicry. Little I think family chronicle supply Weston new field his talents! In midst shame, I could hardly help admiring clever way he remembered details, twisted comic ballad, he composed overnight, he recited mock heroic air voice, made every point tell, kept boys convulsions laughter. Not smile crossed his long, lantern-jawed face; Mr. Thomas Johnson made effort time hide severe fit his peculiar spasms his spotted handkerchief. Sometimes—at night—in bottom heart, darkness seemed thick horrors, I could make mind whether keep ears strained catch first sound anything dreadful, pull blankets head run risk missing it,—in moments, I say, I passing private doubt whether I inherited share family instinct courage crisis. It therefore relief feel moment despair, I waiting till boys, longer amused Weston, turn amuse me, first strongest feeling sense relief Rupert school, I could bear fruits folly shoulders. To spared his hectoring lecturing, his hurt pride, his reproaches, rage me, probable fight Weston, he must seriously hurt I blamed—this comfort. I got lesson well heart. Fifty thousand preachers fifty thousand pulpits could never taught effectually Weston's ballad, laughter his audience, less difference one would like believe vanity bragging one's self vanity bragging one's relations. Also dignified discreet take new acquaintance entire confidence even one blessed friends quick sympathy really enjoy hearing people never seen, well abuse privilege, allow "innings" describing _their_ remarkable parents, brothers, sisters, remoter relatives. I realized fully I stood, burning cheeks downcast eyes, elbow tormentor. But I glad know I would run away even I could. My resolution grew stubborner every peal laughter bear whatever might come pluck good temper. I fool, I would show I coward. I glad Rupert's influenza kept home days. I told briefly I bullied, fault, I would rather say it. I begged promise he would take quarrel way, leave fight myself, he did. When he came back I think he regretted his promise. Happily he never heard ballad, odd verses boys sang place put fury. It long time he forgave me, I doubt he ever quite forgave Weston. I held well I could. I made complaint, kept temper. I must say Henrietta behaved uncommonly well time. "After all, know, Charlie," she said, "you have done anything _really wrong dishonourable_." This true, comforted me. Except Henrietta, I really friend; Rupert angry me, holding school made feel worse home. At last joke began die out, I getting well, one boy, heavy-looking fellow pasty face, always creeping me, asking tell father. "Johnson Minor," called him. He younger brother Thomas Johnson, champion code honour. He older I, he class, though he bigger, he great deal bigger; truth stories I often told, family used fight odds many generations. I thought good deal, measured Johnson Minor eye. At last I got Henrietta wrestle box practice. She always willing anything Tomboyish, indeed she generally willing anything one wanted, her biceps hard mine, I pinched see. We got two pairs gloves, much big us, stuffed cotton wool make like boxing-gloves, used stuff buff-coloured waistcoat acted old gentlemen it. But much good; I like hurt Henrietta I got chance, I think she liked hurt me. So I took dumb-belling every morning night-shirt; last I determined I would Johnson Minor, all. One afternoon, boys friendly me, going paper chase Saturday, he came old way began asking father, quite gravely, like sort poor imitation Weston. So I turned round said, "Whatever father was—he is dead. Your father's alive, Johnson, were not coward, would not go bullying fellow has not got one." "I am coward, I, Master Honourable?" said Johnson, turning scarlet, word _Honourable_ I thought he broken nose. I never felt pain life, pain I felt occasion; afterwards I much much excited, I sorry I cannot remember clearly it, I liked do, first fight. There time fight properly. I obliged best I could. I made sort rough plan head, I would cling Johnson long I able, hit whenever I got chance. I quite know he hitting I hitting him; I know I held on, ground seemed always hitting us both. How long struggling cuffing hitting (less scientifically effectually Henrietta I flourished stuffed driving gloves, strict constant reference woodcuts sixpenny Boxer's Guide) I got slightly stunned, I know; I came round I lying Weston's arms, Johnson Minor weeping bitterly (as he believed) corpse. I fear Weston allayed his remorse. My great anxiety shake hands Johnson. I never felt friendly towards one. He met handsomest way. He apologized speaking father—"since do not like it," he added, appearance sincerity puzzled time, I understand till afterwards—and I apologized calling coward. We always good friends, fight made end particular chaff caused it. It reconciled Rupert too, greatest gain. Rupert quite right. There nothing like prepared emergencies. I suppose, I stunned, Johnson got best it; judging his appearance washed school pump, I quite prepared emergency defend boy twice size. CHAPTER III. SCHOOL CRICKET—LEMON-KALI—THE BOYS' BRIDGE—AN UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY. Rupert I best good friends again. I cared his favour goodwill one else, kept much I could. I played cricket school matches. At least I bat bowl, I junior fellows "fielded out," Rupert waiting ball, I would given life catch quickly throw deftly. I used think one ever looked handsome he his orange-coloured shirt, white flannel trousers, cap Henrietta made him. He I spent savings new shirt, Mother would get new one. She like cricket, anything people could hurt themselves. But Johnson Major got new sky-blue shirt cap, like Rupert outdone him, Johnson's father canal-carrier. But shirt emptied pockets, made old cap look worse ever. Then Henrietta, without saying word us, bought orange flannel, picked old cap pieces, cut new one it, made herself, button, stiff peak everything, really perfectly, looked well sunshine Rupert's brown face glossy black hair. There always sunshine played cricket. The hotter better liked it. We bottle lemon-kali powder ground, I used make fizzing-cup tin mug boys. I got water canal. Lemon-kali delicious hot day—so refreshing! But I sometimes fancied I felt little sick _afterwards_, I great deal. And Bustard (who always called Bustard-Plaster, he doctor's son) said dragons canal water lashing tails inside us. He seen his father's microscope. The field played banks canal, opposite side town. I believe school property. At rate right playing there. We go nearly quarter mile way bridge, vexatious toil quarter mile one side quarter mile get meadow lay directly opposite school. Weston wrote letter weekly paper asking town build us bridge. He wrote splendid letters, one his best. He said town council laughed notion building bridge boys, must remember Boys to-day Men to-morrow (which thought grand sentence, though MacDonald, accurate-minded fellow, said would really years us grown up). Then Weston called us Rising Generation, showed that, probability, Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor, Primate years come played "all unconscious future fame" classic fields lay beyond water, promised hours coming greatness would look back gratitude munificence native city. He put lots Latin in, ended Latin verses his own, he made Goddess Stream plead us her sons. By stream he meant canal, river, course Weston could not help. How watched next week's paper! But was not in. They never put his things in, mortified sadly. His greatest ambition get something his invention printed. Johnson said he believed Weston always put something personal things he wrote. He sarcastic, could not help making fun people. It kinder Weston his best bridge, he much cricketer himself. He said he short-sighted, suited better poke hedges beetles. He splendid collection insects. Bustard used say he poked his nose, he insect himself, proboscis he said his father said pleasure see Weston make section anything, prepare objects microscope. His fingers clever his tongue. It long Rupert got his new shirt cap sad thing happened. We playing cricket one day usual. It hot, I mixing lemon-kali canal, holding mug tempt Weston over, side his proboscis among water-plants collecting larvae. Rupert batting, new fellow, bowled much swiftly accustomed to, ball. I straining ears catch Weston shouting his hands, I saw start point cricketers, turning round I saw Rupert lying ground. The ball hit knee knocked down. He struggled up, tried stand; whilst he saying nothing, scolding fellows going on, he fell fainting pain. "The leg's broken, depend upon it," said Bustard-Plaster; "shall I run father?" I thanked earnestly, I like leave Rupert myself. But Johnson Major, kicking his cricketing-shoes, said, "It will take hour get round. I will go. Get water, keep his cap on. The sun blazing." And could speak he canal swimming across. I went back bank mug, lemon-kali fizzing out, I got water Rupert, last he opened his eyes. As I getting water I saw Weston, unmooring boat fastened little farther up. He evidently coming help us get Rupert across canal. Bustard's words rang ears. Perhaps Rupert's leg broken. Bustard doctor's son, ought know. And I often thought must difficult thing _to_ know, people's legs do not break right break. My first feeling utter bewilderment misery, I collected senses reflection I lost presence mind first real emergency happened me, attendance Rupert's lectures mockery, I must first fool coward family. And I failed emergency broken leg, could I ever hope conduct credit case drowning? I feel thankful Rupert's welfare depend pulling his arms particular way; Weston coming ashore, I took pocket-handkerchief, kneeling Rupert said, good air I could assume, "We must tie broken leg the—" "_Don't touch it_, young fool!" shrieked Rupert. And though directly afterwards he begged pardon speaking sharply, he would hear touching his leg. So got boat best way could, Weston sat hold up, boy bowling pulled across. I was not big enough either, I run round bridge. I fancy must easier act presence mind emergency happened somebody used order much Rupert used order me. CHAPTER IV. A DOUBTFUL BLESSING—A FAMILY FAILING—OLD BATTLES—THE CANAL-CARRIER'S HOME. When found Rupert's leg broken, severe blow his knee, delighted. But weeks months went he still lame pale always tired, began count long past, leg broken, would set, poor Rupert quite well. And Johnny Bustard said legs arms often stronger broken (if properly set, his father could them), felt Gregory would bowl people's shins he better break once, let Mr. Bustard make good job them. The first part time Rupert made light his accident, wanted go back school, irritable impatient. But year went he left talking nonsense, though he suffered great deal he never complained. I used quite miss his lecturing me, he even squabble Henrietta now. This reminds great fault mine—I afraid family failing, though mean one—I jealous. If I "particular friends" one, I liked myself; Rupert "out" Weston affair, I "particular friends" Henrietta. I exactly give her Rupert I right again, she complained one day (I think _she_ jealous too!) I said, "I am particular friends _as sister_ still; know Rupert I boys." I love Rupert dearly, I would given anything everything serve wait upon he laid up; I would rather myself, whereas Henrietta his particular friend. It I know meanly I felt I like say good she was. My Mother delicate, she horror accidents; Henrietta stood Mr. Bustard's elbow time he examining Rupert's knee, she always fomentations things. At first Rupert said she hurt him, would Nurse it; Nurse hurt much more, he would let anybody Henrietta touch it. And he never called her Monkey now, I could see she tried please him. One day she came breakfast her hair done way fashion then, like grown-up young lady, I think Rupert pleased, though she looked rather funny red. And Henrietta nursed altogether, used read battles he lay sofa, Rupert made plans battles cardboard, moved bits pith elder-tree troops, showed Henrietta he moving really, done quite differently way generals did, side would instead beaten. And Mother used say, "That is way poor father used go on! As was not enough run risk killed wounded twice yourself, without bothering head battles you have nothing with." And he battle father fell, planted battery he led his men last time, he struck arm, he waving his sword his head, Rupert turned whiter ever, said, "Good Heavens, Henrietta! Father _limped_ battery! He led his men two hours, he wounded leg, he fell—and I sit grumble knock cricket-ball!" Just Mr. Bustard came in, he shook Rupert's hand he kept his fingers it, shook his head; he said "an abnormal condition pulse," awful tones, I afraid something Rupert would die of. But Henrietta understood better, she would let Rupert battle more. Rupert's friends kind he ill, kindest Thomas Johnson. Johnson's grandfather canal-carrier, made good deal money, Johnson's father got money went business. We great discussion nursery whether Johnson's father gentleman, Rupert ran down-stairs, drawing-room, shouting, "Now, Mother! _is_ carrier gentleman?" And Mother, lying sofa, said, "Of course not. What silly things children ask! Why cannot amuse nursery? It hard come disturb nonsensical question." Rupert always good Mother, he shut drawing-room door gently. Then he came rushing nursery say Mother said "Of course not." But Henrietta said, "What ask her?" And Rupert told her she said, "Of course Mother thought meant one men carts carry things, hood top dog underneath." Johnson's father grandfather carriers kind. They owned lot canal-boats, one two big barges, took kinds things way London. Mr. Johnson used say, "In father's time men business lived near work London country. That is house close wharf. I ashamed trade, place comfortable, I shall stick it. Tom may move town give old house foreman I gone, he likes play fine gentleman." Tom would foolish he did. It dearest old house one could wish for. It built red brick, ivy covered thickly clipped round old-fashioned windows like hedge. The gardens simply perfect. In summer pick many flowers eat much fruit like, use beauty garden, I know is. Johnson's father proud him, let anything he liked, midsummer holidays Johnson used bring his father's trap take Rupert drives, Mrs. Johnson used put meat pies strawberries basket seat, kind picnic, old horse belonged Mr. Bustard, capital one standing still. It partly Johnsons kind Rupert Johnson Minor I became chums school, partly fight made us friendly, I Rupert now, rather jealous his taking completely Henrietta, all, I fancy, Johnson Minor determined friends me. He odd fellow. There nothing he liked much wonderful stories people, I never heard wonderful stories he told himself. When became friends he told he never meant bully he asked father; he really want hear his battles forth. But utmost I could tell father nothing tales he told his grandfather, navy captain. CHAPTER V. THE NAVY CAPTAIN—SEVEN PARROTS IN A FUCHSIA TREE—THE HARBOUR LION AND THE SILVER CHAIN—THE LEGLESS GIANTS—DOWN BELOW—JOHNSON'S WHARF. The Johnsons fond father, he good, kind man; I think would glad he profession instead canal-carrier, I sure pleased think Mrs. Johnson's father navy captain, his portrait—uniform all—hung horsehair sofa dining-room, near window yellow roses used come in. If I could get room myself, I used kneel sofa, one bolsters, gaze faded little picture till I lost balance slippery horsehair intensity interest hero Johnson Minor's tales. Every time, I think, I expected see change expression captain's red face, adapting better what, his grandson's account, his character must been. It seemed odd he look wooden seen much. The captain native South Devon. "Raleigh, Drake, grandfather, lots great sailors born Devonshire," Johnson said. He certainly brag; he spoke slowly quietly, sound like bragging would done he talked faster, I think. The captain lived Dartmouth, place Johnson gave descriptions, day name Dartmouth romantic sound ears, though I know marvels Johnson's invention, barely founded upon real quaintness place, he must heard his mother. It became highest object ambition see captain's native city. That must people—shopkeepers, instance, man keep post office—who lived along, fact I could realize sufficiently envy them. Johnson—or Fred, I used call time—only exaggerated truth shrubs grow greenhouse atmosphere South Devon, he talked captain's fuchsia trees big old willows canal wharf; parrots must complete invention. He said captain seven. Two green, two crimson, two blue, one violet orange-coloured beak grey lining his wings; built nests fuchsia trees sandal-wood shavings, lined captain's silk pocket-handkerchiefs. He said though parrots stole captain's handkerchiefs, much attached him; quarrelled among themselves, swore seven dialects West Coast Africa. Mrs. Johnson herself showed little print Dartmouth harbour, told supposed old times iron chain stretched rock rock across mouth means defence. And afternoon Fred told splendid story chain, made silver, link worth twenty pounds, end fastened padlock every night sunset, keep French, lion sat ledge rock harbour's mouth, key tied round his neck sea-green ribbon. He new ribbon first Sunday every month, Fred said, his mane dirtied fast. A story Fred his grandfather's single-handed encounter lion one occasion, gallant captain would let brig distress harbour sunset, lion would let key, raised opinion his courage his humanity highest point. But he home nothing exploits Fred recounted foreign lands. I fancy Fred must read real accounts South America, tropical forests, wonderful birds flowers, ruins buried cities history; real marvels he built his romances Great Stone City, captain encountered awful race giants legs, carved stones ornaments clasp-knives, Swiss cut pretty things wood, cracked cocoa-nuts fingers. I sure he invented flowers he went along he telling forests. He used look round garden (which would satisfied one seen heard captain come across) say his slow way, "The blue chalice flower shape magnolia, twice big, colour gentians border, great white tassel hanging like cactus parlour window, leaves yellow underneath; smelt like rosemary." If captain's experiences countries outshone befallen his native land, paled wonders he seen, emergencies he placed sea. Fred told his grandfather diving-bell his board his ship, things he saw he went must made his remembrances South American forests appear tame comparison. Once, middle Pacific, captain dropped his bell midst society sea people hair, backs heads shaped like sou'-wester hats. The front rim formed one eyebrow eyes, could move peak behind beavers move tails, helped go water. They exactly mermaids, Fred said, particular tail, ended kind fringe seaweed, swept moved, like train lady's dress. The captain delighted he stayed much longer usual; unlucky moment sea people let water diving-bell, captain nearly drowned. He become senseless, his body floated, picked restored life first mate, cruising, tears his eyes, spot ship's boat seven days without taking anything eat.—"_He_ Dartmouth man, too," said Fred Johnson. "He evidently knew emergency drowning," thought I. I feel one hears Fred's stories must think he liar. But he really not. Mr. Johnson strict boys ways, though he good-natured, Fred taught think lie get scrape anything sort quite wrong thought it. But he liked _telling_ things. I believe he made amused his head he one listen. He used say, "Come sit kitchen garden afternoon, I will _tell_ you." And whether he meant think true not, I certainly believe his stories. One thing always struck odd Fred Johnson. He fond fruit, sat wall ate white currants pounded sugar mug us, I believe he always ate I did, though he "telling" time, I nothing listen eat. He certainly talked slowly, dreary, monotonous sort voice, suited his dull, pasty face better suited subject his exciting narratives. But I think seemed make one impatient hear coming. A favourite place "telling" wharf (Johnson's wharf, called), canal boats came went, loaded unloaded. We made "coastguard station" among old timber corner, used sit watch boats. When real barge came generally went it, men knew Fred, good-natured. The barges seemed like ships canal boats did. They masts, could sail got river. Sometimes went cabin, peeped little berths sliding shutter fronts, lockers, like fixed seat running round two sides cabin, lids opening showing places put away things in. I famous nursery keeping things tidy, I fancied I could stow clothes away perfection locker, almost cook dinner bargeman's little stove. And every time barge loaded up, bargemaster took his post rudder, whilst old horse strained start—and heavy boat swung slowly canal passed sight, I felt sorry left behind upon wharf. CHAPTER VI. S. PHILIP AND S. JAMES—THE MONKEY-BARGE AND THE DOG—WAR, PLAGUE, AND FIRE—THE DULNESS OF EVERYDAY LIFE. There two churches town. Not town large churches small make needful. On contrary, town modest size, traces ever much bigger, churches large handsome. That is, fine outside, might imposing within painted galleries blocked arches tall pews dwarfed majestic rows pillars below. They quarter mile apart. One dedicated S. Philip S. James, commonly called "the brother churches." In tower hung peal eight bells. One clergyman served brother churches, services S. Philip one week S. James next. We accustomed never struck us odd. What seem odd, perhaps little dull, people places go church week week. There one day year peals bells heard, Feast SS. Philip James, also May Day. Then morning prayer S. Philip evening prayer S. James, bells rang changes cannons, went ringing turns evening, bell-ringers escorted one church another May garlands sort triumphal procession. The churches decorated, flags put towers, everybody congregation expected carry nosegay. Rupert I Henrietta Baby Cecil servants always enjoyed thoroughly, thought churches delightfully sweet; Mother said smell cottage nosegays noise bells made her feel ill, pity. Fred Johnson told wonderful stories brother churches. We gone canal field far cricketing field, sort water-meadow, lower down, opposite churches, made us think them. We gone partly get yellow flags try grow tubs Johnson's father water-lilies, partly watch canal-boat "monkey-barge," expected coal. Fred knew old man, hoped go home part cargo old man's dog would let us; he rough terrier, exaggerated conscience, strongly objected anything coming board boat bill lading. He could even reconcile fact people connected barges took liberty walking canal banks. "He have a-going fifteen year," said old man, "and he barks  them still." He barked fiercely us Fred would go board, great annoyance, I never feel afraid dogs, quite sure I could see disposition wag stumpy tail terrier spite his "bowfs." I may wrong, twice I fancied Fred shirked adventures seemed nothing me; I felt odd, I brave I like be, Fred grandson navy captain. I think Fred wanted make forget canal-boat, I followed regretful eyes, he began talking churches. "It must splendid hear sixteen bells going once," said he. "They never do," said I, unmollified. "They do—_sometimes_," said Fred slowly, impressively I constrained ask "When?" "In great emergencies," Fred's reply, startled me. But lived place part lives, Fred's family belonged it, he must know better I. "Is call doctor?" I asked, thinking drowning, broken bones, apoplectic fits. "It is call everybody," said Fred; "that time war, town danger. And Great Plague here, S. Philip S. James tolled day long bells muffled. But there is fire ring backwards, witches say prayers, know." War plague long time, fire town remembrance; Fred said awful calamities kind happened within memory man, town still built great part wood, one night, high gale, whole place, except houses, destroyed fire. After streets rebuilt stone bricks. These new tales Fred told me, places I knew, terrible interest peculiarly own. For captain's dangers good now, war, plague, fire town might come again. I thought day, dreamed night. Once I remember awakened, I fancied, clanging two peals discordant unison, I opened eyes bright light wall convinced town fire. Fred's vivid descriptions rushed mind, I looked expecting see S. Philip S. James standing like dark rocks sea dancing flames, bells ringing backwards, "as witches say prayers." It I saw towers standing grey quiet grey quiet town, I found light upon wall came street lamp below, head seemed grow clearer, I knew bells ringing, I fancied I heard prolonged echoes bad dream. I glad so, I exactly wish war plague come back; yet I heard Fred's tales restless I grew, days dull, never went anywhere, nothing ever happened. CHAPTER VII. WE RESOLVE TO RUN AWAY—SCRUPLES—BABY CECIL—I PREPARE—I RUN AWAY. I think Fred's telling tales navy captain's boyhood put heads way people age, position, begin life adventure run away. The captain run away. He ran away school. But school one made hair stand end hear of. The master must monster tyranny, boys little prodigies wickedness misery, food would rejected respectably reared pigs. It put his grandson disadvantage excuses kind running away grammar school. Dr. Jessop little pompous, he sometimes positively kind. There even cruel usher. I dunce, Fred—though he class—so even grievance connection lessons. This made feel would something mean almost dishonourable running away school. "I think would fair Doctor," said I; "it would look he driven us it, he has not. We better wait till holidays." Fred seemed willing wait I expected; he planned go vigorously ever. It without qualms I thought running away home. My mother would certainly greatly alarmed; she greatly alarmed many things she afterwards became reconciled! My conscience reproached Rupert Henrietta. Not one us longed "events" exploits earnestly sister; Rupert prepared emergencies, perhaps captain cope with, kinds recognized yellow leather book? We happy together—Rupert, Henrietta, Baby Cecil, I—and felt common one defect lives events them; I going begin life adventure, run away seek fortune, without even telling I going do. On hand, old mean twinge jealousy one strongest impulses adventure-seeking, urged perform exploits alone. Some people seem like dangers adventures whilst dangers going on; Henrietta always seemed think pleasantest part; I confess I think one best parts must enjoying credit them. When captain's adventures stirred I looked forward thrill anticipation return home—modest justifiable pride achievements, covered renown deeds daring I play second fiddle family more, Rupert Henrietta would outbid "particular" friendship, Baby Cecil dog heels hear stories adventures. The thought Baby Cecil heaviest pang I felt I dissatisfied idea running away home. Baby Cecil pet house. He born father's death, day he born everybody conspired make much him. Dandy, Scotch terrier, would renounce romping ramble us keep watch Baby Cecil he really baby, carried dull airing nursemaid's arms. I quite understand Dandy's feelings; one preparing paperchase, anything sort, Baby Cecil trotted and, flinging head first one's arms, his usual fashion, cried, "Baby Cecil 'ants Charlie tell long, long story—_so much!_" always ended one's giving race scramble, devoting one's self sedately Dandy his service. But I consoled thought Baby Cecil would delight me, stories I able tell return. The worst running away now-a-days railways telegrams run faster. I prepared emergency except found brought home again. Thinking brought mind one Fred's tales captain, he pursued bloodhounds escaped getting water. Water retains scent, keeps track. I think perhaps one reason boys often go sea run away, one may able follow them. It helped decision would go sea ran away, Fred I. Besides, road strange countries, way seeing sea people sou'-wester heads. Fred seem scruples leaving his home, made feel much braver he must I. But his head full plans he made us, lists he drew natural products earth various places could live without paying living, he neglected his school-work, got scrapes it. This distressed much, I working best half purpose one might say ran away lessons, might understood gone solely search adventure, like sea-captains grown-up travellers. All Fred's tales began word "suppose." They stories happened his grandfather, might happen us. The half-holiday Mr. Johnson's hay carted sat behind farthest haycock afternoon old atlas knees, Fred "supposed" till brain whirled think coming us. "Suppose get board vessel bound Singapore, hide behind old casks—" he would say, coasting strange continents his stumpy little forefinger, recklessly captain himself; course I asked, "What Singapore like?" enabled Fred close atlas lie back among hay say whatever he could think I could believe. Meanwhile saved pocket-money put canvas bag, sailor-like. Most money Fred's, he generous this, said I take care I managing he. And practised tree-climbing ready masts, ate earth-nuts learn live upon roots case thrown upon desert island. Of course give proper meals, obliged yet, I sometimes felt rather doubtful feel living upon nothing roots breakfast, dinner, tea. However, I observed whenever captain wrecked barrel biscuits went ashore soon afterwards, I hoped might always wrecks, biscuits go long way, especially sailors' biscuits, large. I made kind handbook adventure-seekers, too, old exercise book, showing might expected prepared career like captain's. I divided certain heads: Hardships, Dangers, Emergencies, Wonders, &c. These subdivided thus: Hardships—I, Hunger; 2, Thirst; 3, Cold; 4, Heat; 5, No Clothes; forth. I got information Fred, I read lists get used ideas, feel brave. And last page I printed red ink word "Glory." And half went came end; old Doctor gave three prizes, spoke he hoped I would next half, blushes solely modest pride. The first step runaway travels decided upon long ago. We go barge London. "And London go anywhere," Fred said. The day holidays began I saw canal-boat lading wharf, finding she bound London I told Fred it. But he said better wait barge, would one Thursday. "Or do not think ready then, wait next," he added. He seemed quite willing wait, (remembering captain's preparations his longest voyage taken eighteen half minutes chronometer, afterwards damaged diving-bell accident, I seen eyes, confirmation story) I said I ready time half-an-hour's notice, Thursday fixed day departure. To facilitate matters decided Fred invite spend Wednesday him, stay night, barge start half-past six of the clock Thursday morning. I busy Wednesday. I wrote letter mother I hoped I made quite clear ambition discontent leading run away. I also made will, dividing things fairly Rupert, Henrietta, Baby Cecil, case I drowned sea. My knife, prayer-book, ball string belonging kite, little tool-box I took away me. I also took match-box writing-table, I told Mother letter. The captain used light his fires rubbing sticks together, I tried it, thought matches would much better, rate begin with. Rupert lying crab-tree, Henrietta reading him, I went away. Rupert getting much stronger; he could walk stick, going back school next half. I felt unreasonable vexation seemed quite cheerful. But I leaving garden go fields, Baby Cecil came running me, his wooden spade one hand plant chick weed other, crying: "Charlie, dear! Come tell Baby Cecil story." I kissed him, tied his hat on, come he ran. "Not now, Baby," I said; "I going now, gardening." "I do not want garden," he pleaded. "Where going? Take you." "I going Fred Johnson's," I said bravely. Baby Cecil good child, though he much petted. He gave sigh disappointment, said gravely, "Will promise, _onyer-onner_, tell one come back?" "I promise tell lots _when I come back_, honour," answer. I skirt garden-hedge yard two turning across meadow. In minutes I heard voice side. Baby Cecil run inside, poking his face hole, kissing hands me. There came head wonder whether his face would much changed next time I saw it. I little guessed would be. But he cried, "Come back _very soon_, Charlie dear," imperfect valour utterly gave way, hanging head I ran, hot tears pouring face, way Johnson's wharf. When Fred saw face he offered give idea I felt faint-hearted it. Nothing he could said would dried tears soon. Every spark pride blazed reject thought turning craven now. Besides, I longed life adventure sincerely; I soon quite happy excitement near I longed for. CHAPTER VIII. WE GO ON BOARD—THE PIE—AN EXPLOSION—MR. ROWE THE BARGE-MASTER—THE 'WHITE LION'—TWO LETTERS—WE DOUBT MR. ROWE'S GOOD FAITH. The dew still heavy grass Fred I crossed drying-ground five of the clock Thursday morning, scrambled hedge "coastguard" corner wharf. We want seen barge-master till far home put ashore. The freshness early morning summer quality seems go straight heart. I felt intensely happy. There lay barge, sun shining clean deck, dewy edges old ropes, barge-master's zinc basin pail put sweeten air. "She will not leave us behind time!" I cried, turning triumphantly Fred. "Take care pie," said Fred. It meat-pie he taken larder morning; he told Mrs. Johnson letter he left behind him; explained took instead breakfast otherwise eaten. We felt earth-nuts might forthcoming canal banks, even wharf Nine Elms reached London. At quarter six Johnson's wharf quite deserted. The barge-master breakfast ashore, second man gone stable. "We better hide now," I said. So crept went board. We chosen hiding-place before. Not cabin, course, among cargo, something extra thrown last moment might smother us lead discovery, fore part boat, sort well _hold_, odd things belonging barge stowed away, made sheltered nooks could creep sight. Here found convenient corner, squatted down, pie feet, behind hamper, box, coil rope, sack hay, large ball, crossed four ways rope, rope-tail, puzzled extremely. "It is like giant tadpole," I whispered Fred. "Do not nudge me," said Fred. "My pockets full, hurts." _My_ pockets far light. The money-bag heavily laden change—small value large coin. The box matches knife. String, nails, prayer-book, pencil, writing-paper, handbook, useful hammer one tool-box filled another pocket. Some gooseberries piece cake trousers, I carried tool-box hands. We change linen, tied pocket-handkerchief. Fred would allow nothing else. He said jackets trousers worn must make new clothes old sail. Waiting dull work. After awhile, however, heard voices, tramp horse, barge-master Mr. Johnson's foreman men kept coming going deck, quarter hour many hairbreadth escapes discovery captain could circumstances. At last somebody threw barge-master bag something (fortunately soft) he leaving behind, he chucked top head. Then driver called his horse, barge gave jerk, threw Fred pie, moment gliding slowly smoothly stream. When fairly ventured peep little, stretch cramped limbs. There one board barge-master, he end vessel, smoking minding his rudder. The driver walking towing-path old grey horse. The motion boat smooth seemed lying still whilst villages orchards green banks osier-beds went slowly by, though world coming show us, instead going see world. When passed town felt anxiety fear stopped; one bank, though towers S. Philip S. James appeared lessening size looked back, came last bend canal, high bank gorse shut distance, saw more. In hour, breakfast, began speak seriously pie. (I observed Fred breaking little corners crust absent air once.) Thinking first subdivision word Hardships handbook, I said, "I am afraid ought wait till _worse hungry_." But Fred said, "Oh no!" And adventure-seeking quite impossible save plan divide meals exactly, could never tell might turn up. The captain always said, "Take good luck bad luck pot-luck come!" So Fred assured me, resolved abide captain's rule. "We may weigh food bullet, like Admiral Bligh, next week," said Fred. "So may," said I. And thought must given extra relish beefsteak hard-boiled eggs, I never tasted anything good. Whether smell pie went aft, whether something else made barge-master turn round come forward, I know; encumbered open clasp-knives, full mouths, saw bearing upon us, hasty movement retreat I lost balance, went backward crash upon tub potatoes. The noise made worst part business. I tightly wedged amongst odds ends, money-bag sharply crushed match-box, time well warmed, matches exploded body, whilst I putting heroic face I could pain I enduring right funny-bone, Fred cried, "Your jacket's smoking. You are fire!" Whether Mr. Rowe, barge-master, learnt presence mind book, I know; Fred I could even think emergency, jacket off, matches overboard, Mr. Rowe squeezing smouldering fire pocket, rather deliberately men brush hats. Then, civilly holding jacket put again, he took his hat, took his handkerchief it, wiped his head, replacing both, his eyes upon us, said, deliberately still, "Well, young gentlemen, nice start!" It impossible resist feeling confidence inspired Mr. Rowe's manner, his shrewd stolid appearance, his promptness emergency. Besides, completely his mercy. We appealed it, told plans. We offered share pie too, he accepted conscious condescension. When dish empty he brought his handkerchief use more, said, peculiarly oracular manner, "You look me, young gentlemen, I will put way every think." The immediate advantage took offer ask whatever interested us landscape constantly passing eyes, barge-furniture feet. The cord-compressed balls shore-fenders, said Mr. Rowe, popped side barge likely grate shore, another vessel. "Them's osier-beds. They cuts  them every year basket-work. Wot's little bird a-hanging head downwards? It is titmouse looking insects, is. There is scores  them osier-beds. Aye, aye, yellow lilies pretty enough, there is lake way—a mile two beyond father's, Master Fred—where there is white water-lilies. They are pretty, like! It is rum thing spring," continued Mr. Rowe, puffs his pipe, "to see lilies come bottom canal; leaves packed neat parcel, git top, turns spreads water flat could spread cloth upon table." As rule, Mr. Rowe could give us names aquatic plants clutched went by, shells got mud; his eye water-rat like terrier's. It thing seemed excite him. About mid-day stopped village, Mr. Rowe business. The horse rest bait here; barge-master told us "a shilling about" us, might dine excellent bread cheese _White Lion_, even go far poached eggs yet excellent bacon, resources allowed it. We sorry go ashore. There absolutely shelter deck barge sunshine, glaringly reflected water. The inn parlour low, dark cool. I felt doubtful luxury even cheese beefsteak-pie Fred smacked his lips ordered eggs bacon, I paid canvas-bag. As sat together I said, "I wrote letter mother, Fred. Did write Mrs. Johnson?" Fred nodded, pulled scrap dirty paper his pocket, saying, "That is letter; I made tidy copy afterwards." I said Fred class, though he older; he bad spelling. Otherwise letter well, except smudges. "DEAR MOTHER, "Charlie I going run away least time get run away never mind wen we have seen wurld cumming back took pi wich I hope will not mind brekfust I will bring back dish send best love I have tell to-day affectionate son FRED." I saw Mr. Rowe busy bar _White Lion_, sheet paper old steel pen, looked point attenuated hair-like fineness sheer age. He started sight me, caused drop large blot ink sharp point pen his paper. I left wiping his handkerchief. But never struck he writing letter subject Fred I writing about. He was, however: Mr. Johnson keeps tied Fred's day. The spelling order. "MR. JOHNSON. HONERD SIR. "i rites duty bound acqaint young genlemen me, looking Advenchurs asking pardon wish may find innercent 2 Babes Wood London Lancingford Canal come aboard quite unknown blowed theirselves lucifers fust go you have need trubble sir ill keep I bring safe hand return cargo hoping you will excuse stamp expecting rite fust stoppige obedient humble servant "SAMUEL ROWE." As I said, suspect Mr. Rowe betrayed us post; course afternoon Fred said me, "I will tell what, Charlie, I know old Rowe well, he is trick, sure want keep father. If do not take care he will take us back him. And fools shall look then!" The idea intolerable; I warned Fred carefully avoid betraying suspected him. The captain worse enemies outwit, kept pirate good humour much longer voyage affability rum. We means clouding Mr. Rowe's particularly sharp wits grog, resolved amiable wary, get London look first opportunity giving barge-master slip. CHAPTER IX. A COASTING VOYAGE—MUSK ISLAND—LINNET FLASH—MR. ROWE AN OLD TAR—THE DOG-FANCIER AT HOME. It delightful feature first voyage—and one could hope enjoy often voyages come—that always close land, sides. We could touch either coast without difficulty, barge stopped several times day rest horse, Fred I one chance going ashore. I hope many voyage yet, see stranger people places I saw then, I hardly hope ever enjoy much again. I long ago found Fred's stories captain's adventures true stories, I read learned world I knew time, I know certain things one meet land sea. But Fred I made first voyage emulation his grandfather limit expectations, prepared see experience every fresh bend London Lancingford Canal. I remember one Fred's stories captain his spending year day island called Musk Island, Pacific. He left ship, Fred said, little exploring alone his gig. Not knowing time captain's gig boat, I good deal puzzled, I remember, think Mrs. Johnson's red-faced father crossing sea gig like one Mr. Bustard used go his professional "rounds" in. And Fred spoke his "pulling himself" I yet bewildered unavoidable conclusion horse board, gallant ever-ready captain went shafts. The wonder his getting Musk Island fashion was, however, eclipsed wonders he found he get there. Musk-hedges bowers ten feet high, flowers large bindweed blossoms, ladies pale gold hair dressed straw-coloured satin, lovely faces captain vowed power earth move till he learned enough language propose health Musk Island beauties suitable speech dinner. "And he would lived died, I believe," Fred would say, "if first mate, saved his life before, rescued main force, taken back his ship." I reminded story I think island Linnet Lake, deeply charmed nearly broke voyage, captain broke his, settle it. Mr. Rowe called lake Linnet Flash. Wherever canal seemed spread out, go narrow like river, barge-master called lakes "flashes" canal. There flash canal large beautiful Linnet Lake, middle lake lies island. It three of the clock, hottest part summer's day, Fred I, rather faint heat, sitting coil rope holding clean sheet, Mr. Rowe brought cabin protect heads backs sunstroke. We refused take shelter below, sat watching fields hedges, seemed palpitate heat went giddily by, Mr. Rowe, stood quite steady, conversing coolly driver. The driver board last hour, way clear, old horse quite able take care us, he barge-master pocket-handkerchiefs hats like sou'-wester flaps captain's sea-friends. Fred dropped his end sheet fall asleep, I protecting us both, driver bawled directions horse common language, barge-master said, "Here is bit shade you, Master Fred;" roused found gliding lee island covered trees. "Oh, _do_ stop here!" cried. "Well, I do not mind," said Mr. Rowe, removing his hat, mopping his useful pocket-handkerchief. "Jem, there is bit grass there, let her mouthful." "I thought you would like this," he continued; "there are not prettier bit Pyebridge." It lovely, idea seized Fred me: Why settle here, least time? It uninhabited island, waiting claimed adventurous navigator, obviously fertile. The prospect blackberries mainland particularly fine, would ripen blazing sun! Birds sang trees above; fish leaping flies broke still surface water musical splash below; beyond doubt must largest sweetest earth-nuts island, easy get deep beds untouched leaf-mould. And Mr. Rowe cried "Look!" saw water-fowl scud across lake, leaving sharp trail like line light behind her, felt might spend savings getting Pacific Ocean, find got place offered natural resources desert islander. If barge-master would gone ashore mainland way, could got ashore island without help, confided plans doubtful friend. As was, obliged tell Mr. Rowe proposed found settlement Linnet Lake, he completely opposed idea. It he said (with air reserved funded knowledge gave unfathomable depth his irony, made his sayings oracular)—"There is different places world Linnet Flash"—that began ashamed hasty enthusiasm, think would pity stop short adventurous career. So decided go on; masterly way Mr. Rowe spoke world made think he must seen good deal it, looked last upon island, crept lowered mast old brick bridge young ferns hung archway, travelling flat banks coppices gave us shelter, I said barge-master—"Have ever sea, Mr. Rowe?" "Seven_teen_ year Royal Navy," said Mr. Rowe, strong emphasis upon _teen_, he feared might injustice thinking he served his Queen country seven. For next two hours Fred I sat, indifferent alike sunshine shore, rapt attention Mr. Rowe's narrative his experiences sea flag "Braved thousand years battle breeze." I believe Fred enjoyed simply stories, fanned heart restless fever sea-breezes cure. I think Mr. Rowe got excited he recalled old times. And he began bawl sea-songs voice like Atlantic gale, he vowed cadence "A sailor's life life me," I felt life also, expressed strongly effect Mr. Rowe became alarmed consequences his indiscretion, thenceforward told us sea-stories obvious quite futile intention disgusting I already looked upon profession. But barge-master's rapid change tactics convinced could safely rely help us plans. About five of the clock he made tea board, boiled water little stove cabin. I anxious help, I literally made tea, whilst Mr. Rowe's steadier hand cut thick slices bread-and-butter large loaf. There one cup saucer. Fred I shared cup, barge-master took saucer. By preference, he said, tea cooled quicker. The driver tea returned deck could attend horse boat. Except island Linnet Lake, entertaining events first day voyage passing villages detached houses canal banks. Of latter far interesting dog-fancier, whose residence melodious howls, dog-dialect every tribe deserving represented choice company, wafted stream, met ears eyes beheld landing-stage establishment, dog-fancier his dogs lounging cool evening, glad see barge. The fancier knew Mr. Rowe, refreshed (and us) shandy-gaff horn tumblers. Some dogs not, barked incessantly us, wagging tails time, however, doubts correctness judgment matter. One small, white, fluffy toy-dog, dove-coloured ribbon, was—no doubt—incurably ill-tempered inhospitable; large brindled bull-dog, trying politely vainly hide his teeth tongue, wagged fancier left tail, dribbled pleasure making acquaintance, will not his benevolent much-maligned family. I since felt pretty certain Mr. Rowe gave his friend sketch prospects intentions spirit he written Mr. Johnson, I distinctly overheard dog-fancier make reply, words "hoffer reward" audible. But barge-master shook his head suggestions probably drawn his friend's professional traditions, though fancier told good story ill-tempered toy-dog, he referred violent jerks head threatened throw his fur cap brindled gentleman sat dripping smiling his feet. When Mr. Rowe began tell something good return, spite utmost endeavours hear anything, words "Linnet Flash" became audible, I blushed hear fancier choking his shandy-gaff laughter, I feared project settling island. The interview end, Mr. Rowe stepped briskly board, fur cap nodded forehatch, Fred I sitting coiled ropes, fancier said knowingly, "The better breed gamier beast." He patted bull-dog he said it, bull-dog kissed his dirty hand. "Hup hanythink," Mr. Rowe's parting words, he went aft, driver called his horse. He may referred bull-dog, I doubts it, even then. CHAPTER X. LOCKS—WE THINK OF GOING ON THE TRAMP—PYEBRIDGE—WE SET SAIL. During first day's voyage passed two locks. There one far home, Fred I see barge pass it, sitting bank whilst boat gradually sank level water below. It great fun board whilst barge went down, though I must say feel anything peculiar, sank gradually. "Just fancy hole ship's bottom," said Fred, "and settling board. Some ships do, never heard again." We amused went along guessing beforehand shore next house hamlet would appear. We betted shillings result, neither us lost, however often shillings changed hands, remained canvas bag. Perhaps places look events happened know well. I noticed even town looked interesting water I ever seen look, I dare say strangers appear dull is. All villages canal banks looked interesting. We passed one soon tea, horse rested old willows towing-path, Mr. Rowe went ashore. Whilst barge-master delivered parcel friend, Fred I strolled lane led us past cottages gay gardens church. The church like S. Philip S. James. It squat, ivy-covered, carefully restored; stood garden flowers almost hid graves. Just outside lych-gate, four lanes met, shady inviting, impossible say might lead to, I said Fred, "You said way run away besides going sea _tramp_. It sounds rather low, need not beg, I think walking would nice change, I do not believe would much slower barge, would much shadier. And could get Old Rowe once, hide heard anybody coming. I wonder far London now?" "Not far, I dare say," said Fred, pleased idea; "and keep must get time. And get things eat hedges, cannot barge." At moment passed boy, I said, "Which way London, please?" four roads choose from. "What d' say?" said boy. I repeated question. "Do Not Know," he replied, trying cram half his hand his mouth. The captain would thought stupid he met native one islands Pacific, I sure; I followed him, begged try think he heard people going London. At last his face brightened. He looking head lane. "There is man a-cummin yonder's always a-going Lunnon," said he. Visions companion tramp—also perhaps search adventures—made look briskly round. "Him pipe, b'longs barge," boy exclaimed. It indeed Mr. Rowe come look us, try seem glad see him, go board more. Towards evening canal banks became dotted fishers ages degrees, fishing patiently, though seem catch much. Soon dark reached town Pyebridge. When barge lay-to night, driver taking horse away stable, Mr. Rowe confronted us, his firmest manner, question, "And going sleep, young gentlemen?" "Where _you_ going sleep, Mr. Rowe?" said I, thoughtful pause. "_I_ sleeps below, captain's cabin guv one—unless Queen," replied barge-master, humorously decidedly. "We like sleep deck," said I. But Mr. Rowe would hear it, account various dreadful diseases he assured us would contracted sleeping "in damps water," "the dews _h_air," "the rays moon." "There is hotel—" he began; I said once, "We could not afford hotel, know cheap place much obliged." Mr. Rowe took his hat took his handkerchief, though longer hot. Having cleared his brain, he said he "would see," he finally led us along one pebbled streets Pyebridge small house small shop-window sale vegetables, card announcing beds let. A little old woman got behind big old geranium window entered, her Mr. Rowe made arrangements night. We got clean bed, mug milk slice bread treacle apiece breakfast next morning, I paid two shillings. As I thanked old lady bade her good day, she called hold hat, she filled cherries, stood door watched us sight. There railway station Pyebridge, might easily escaped Mr. Rowe, gone train London. But besides fact funds becoming low, water new attraction us. We left canal behind, henceforward river. If wind favoured us sail. "A canal's nothing river," said Mr. Rowe, "same river's nothing sea," Fred difficulty keeping his hat gusty street (mine use fruit-basket), barge-master said "nice fresh morning," I felt life Linnet Island would tame indeed compared hopes fears career depended winds waves. And boom went barge's mast, tightly corded roll dark canvas began struggle liberty, writhe flap throttling noises heads, Mr. Rowe wrestled driver helped him, Fred I tried to, swept overboard consequence, whilst barge-master encouraged strange savage sounds—and sunshine caught nut-brown sail she spread gallantly breeze, excitement grew till cried one breath, "This something _like_ sea!" CHAPTER XI. MR. ROWE ON BARGE-WOMEN—THE RIVER—NINE ELMS—A MYSTERIOUS NOISE—ROUGH QUARTERS—A CHEAP SUPPER—JOHN'S BERTH—WE MAKE OUR ESCAPE—OUT INTO THE WORLD. Mr. Rowe quite right. A canal nothing river. There wide piece water us one banks now, barges went us, sailing, towing only, two three women rudder, children deck. "I would not wife fam'ly board something!" said Mr. Rowe grimly. "Have got family, Mr. Rowe?" I inquired. "Yes, sir," said barge-master. "I have, like folk. But women children's best ashore." "Of course are," said I. "If turn mind _might_ good now," he continued, unfathomable eye mistress passing canal-boat, "you would say washing decks keeping pots clean. And do not well man—not half." "They seem steer pretty well," said I. "I have served different vessels I am now," said Mr. Rowe, avoiding reply, "and I _may_ come low monkey-barge coal; I am blessed ever I see walk towing-path leave missus command board." At moment barge came sailing alongside us. "Oh look!" cried Fred, "it is got white horse painted sail." "That is lime barge, sir," said Mr. Rowe; "all lime barges marked way." She homeward bound, empty, soon passed us, went pretty good pace ourselves. The wind kept favourable, matter Fred I took deepest interest. We licked fingers, held see side got cooled breeze, whenever experiment convinced still behind us, I could help running back Fred say triumph, "The wind's dead aft," he knew nothing it. At last seemed annoy him, I went contain sitting potato-tub watching shore. We got Thames earlier usual, thanks fair wind. The world certainly beautiful place. I suppose I get right it, go sea, countries, I shall think nothing England Thames, new wonderful Fred then. The green slopes fine trees, houses gardens river, boats rocking steps, osier islands, Mr. Rowe called "Aits," bridges mast lowered, craft water—the red-sailed barges one man board—the steamers crowded decks gay awnings—the schooners, yachts, pleasure boats—and people shore, fishers, people water-dogs sticks, ladies fine dresses parasols, ragged boys cheered us went by—everything saw heard delighted us, sore place heart I longed Rupert Henrietta enjoy too. Later saw London. It moonlight passed Chelsea. Mr. Rowe pointed Hospital, pensioners must asleep, wooden leg stirring. In less half-an-hour afterwards end voyage. The first thing struck Nine Elms seen. I thought elms burning sun first day. I imagined land last green bank, shelter majestic grove might tempt Mr. Rowe sleep, Fred I steal gently away neighbouring city, begin quite independent search adventures. But I think I must mixed expectations story one captain's escapes—from savage chief mango-grove. Our journey's end quite I thought would be, novel interesting enough. We seemed thoroughly got town. Very old houses feeble lights paper-patched windows made strange reflections river. The pier looked dark dirty even moonlight, threw blacker stranger shadows still. Mr. Rowe busy tired, and—we thought—a little inclined cross. "I wonder shall sleep!" said Fred, looking timidly dark old houses. I said I find hard work brave dark, I put good face matter, said I dared say old Rowe would find us cheap bedroom. "London's awful place robbers murders, know," said Fred. I hoping cold shiver running back due barge-master called "the damps water"—when wail like cry hurt child made skin stiffen goose-prickles. A wilder moan succeeded, one windows one dark houses opened, something thrown fell heavily down. Mr. Rowe coming board again, I found courage emergency gasp out, "What that?" "Wot's wot?" said Mr. Rowe testily. "That noise falling thing." "Somebody throwing, something cat," said barge-master. "Stand aside, sir, _if_ please." It relief, length Mr. Rowe came his cap off, act taking his handkerchief, said, "I suppose you are richer yesterday, young gentlemen—how bed?"—I said, "No—o. That is, I mean get us cheap one safe—I mean respectable place." "If leaves comfortable 'ome, sir," moralized barge-master, "to go a-looking adventures fashion, must put rough quarters, wot get." "We will go anywhere think right, Mr. Rowe," said I diplomatically. "I knows waterman," said Mr. Rowe, "that Royal Navy like myself. He lives near here, they are decent folk. The place poor place, you will make best it, young gentlemen, shilling  will cover damage. If wants supper must pay it. Give missis money, she will best she can, bring change half-farthing." My courage fully restored, Fred much overwhelmed roughness streets passed through, drunken, quarrelling, poverty-struck people, grim, dirty old houses. "We shall directly," I whispered, indeed minutes Mr. Rowe turned shabby entry, led us one several lower buildings round small court. The house he stopped cleaner within without, woman civil. "It is poor place, sir," said she; "but always keep berth, his father calls it, son John." "But cannot take son's bed," said I; "we will sit here, let us." "Bless ye, love," said woman, "John's foreign parts. He is sailor, sir, like his father him; John's merchant service." Mr. Rowe bade us good-night. "I will round morning," said he. "What of the clock, Mr. Rowe?" I asked; I reason asking. "There are not much way return cargo," he replied; "but I have bit business father, Mr. Fred, that will take half-past nine. I will then, young gentlemen, show bit." "It is roughish quarters you," added bargemaster, looking round; "but you will find rougher quarters sea, Master Charles." Mr. Howe's moralizings nettled me, good, whole thoughts bent evading his guardianship getting sea, poor Fred quite overpowered. "I wish safe home again," he almost sobbed I went corner he huddled himself. "You will right we are afloat," said I. "I am hungry," he moaned. I hungry myself, decided order supper, woman came civilly asked she could anything us went bed, I said, "If please we are rather hungry, cannot afford anything expensive. Do think get us anything—rather cheap—for supper?" "A red herring?" she suggested. "What price they?" I felt bound inquire. "Mrs. Jones beautiful mild two penny. You _can_ get  them three penny, would not like  them, sir." I felt convinced expression her face I not, I ordered two. "And penny loaf?" suggested landlady, getting her bonnet behind door. "If please." "And bunch radishes pint fourpenny would fivepence-half-penny lot, sir." "If please. And, please, do," said I, drawing shilling bag, thought herrings made ravenous, I wanted her go. She returned quickly bread, herrings. The "fourpenny" proved beer. She gave sixpence-half-penny change, puzzled calculations. "You said _fourpenny_," said I, indicating beer. "Yes, sir, it is pint," reply; after-years I learned beer fourpence quart known people "fourpenny" I got part reckoning canvas bag straight mind. The room unwholesome smell it, odour fried herrings soon pleasantly overpowered. The bread good, beer us harm. Fred picked his spirits again; Mr. Rowe's old mate came home he found us cheerful chatty. Fred asked son sea, I important questions put, I managed do, sufficiently careless air. "I suppose lots ships London?" said I. "In Docks, sir, plenty," said host. "And Docks?" I inquired. "Are far you?" "Well, see, sir, there is many docks. There is East India Docks, St. Katharine's Docks, Commercial Docks, Victoria Dock, lots more." I pondered. Ships East India Dock probably went India. St. Katharine conveyed nothing mind. I fancy Commercial Docks. I felt loyal inclination towards Victoria Dock. "How people get Victoria Dock now, want to?" I asked. "Well, course, sir, go river, part way rail Fenchurch Street." "Where Fenchurch Street, Mr. Smith?" said I, becoming good deal ashamed pertinacity. "In city, sir," said Mr. Smith. The city! Now I never heard one story going world seek his fortune, coming city, go see seen. Leaving king's daughter kinds things, belong story-books, question, I believe captain would passed new city without looking it. "You go river Fenchurch Street—in barge?" I suggested. "Bless ye, no, sir!" said Mr. Smith, getting smoke his pipe his throat wrong way laughing, till I thought his coughing-fit would never allow give important information I required. "There is boats, sir, plenty  them. I could take myself, thankful, there is steamers calls wharf every quarter hour day, nine morning, takes London Bridge threepence. It are not many minutes' walk Fenchurch Street, train takes straight Docks." After conversed general seafaring matters. Mr. Smith able-bodied man, consequence many years' service unhealthy climates, he said; he complained his trade "poor one," different his father's time, new London Bridge built, "anybody anything could get through" without watermen's assistance. In his present depressed condition he seemed look back his seafaring days pride tender regret, asked tales his adventures he checked none scruples withheld Mr. Rowe encouraging sailor. "John's berth" proved truckle-bed closet held it, also held nasty smells I could believed room for. Opening window seemed let fresh ones. When Fred threw his face bed, said, "What beastly hole!" cried bitterly, I afraid he going ill; I said prayers persuaded say his come bed, I thought got safely night would make return voyage Mr. Rowe, future leave events emergencies liked danger discomfort. But woke sun shining faces, little window beheld sparkling river us, distant city, felt right again, stuck plans. "Let us go city," said Fred, "I like see town." "If do not get half-past nine we are lost," said I. We found unexpected clog Mr. Smith, seemed inclined stick us repeat stories he told us overnight. At half-past eight, however, he went his boat, saying he supposed wait Mr. Rowe, his wife went neighbour's house I laid shilling table, Fred I slipped made way pier. Mr. Rowe there, church clock near struck nine. This echoed city once, began look anxiously steamer. Five, ten minutes must passed—they seemed hours me—when I asked man waiting also steamer London Bridge would come. "She will soon," said he. "So old Rowe," whispered Fred. But steamer came first, went board; paddles began splash, escape accomplished. It lovely morning, tall, dirty old houses looked almost grand sunlight left Nine Elms. The distant city came nearer shone brighter, fretted front Houses Parliament went us like fairy palace, towers blocks buildings rose solidly one behind another shining tints white grey blue summer sky, noise paddle-wheels came distant roar busy streets—Fred pressed arm I pushed his said, "We are world last!" CHAPTER XII. EMERGENCIES AND POLICEMEN—FENCHURCH STREET STATION—THIRD CLASS TO CUSTOM HOUSE—A SHIP FOREST. Policemen useful people. I know got London Bridge Pier Fenchurch Street Station Fred told he knew one could ask policemen way places. There nothing pay, I glad of, canvas bag getting empty. Once twice helped us emergencies. We go one footpath another, straight across street, street full carts cabs drays omnibuses, one could see quite impossibility. We it, however, policeman made us. I said, "Had not better wait till crowd gone?" But policeman laughed, said better take lodgings close wait window. So it. Fred said captain ran little cutter two big ships firing him, I think much worse running backing dray, full rolling barrels, hansom cab pulled ramping like rocking-horse lowest point rockers. When safely pavement thanked policeman much, went on, asking way till got Fenchurch Street. If anything could smell nastier John's berth Nine Elms Fenchurch Street Station. And I think worse way; John's berth smelt horrible, warm weather-tight. You never swallow drop pure air Fenchurch Street Station, yet cannot find corner get draughts. With one gale blowing right open door, another gale blowing left steps, nasty smells blowing every point compass, I stood dirty little hole dirty wooden wall took tickets. I stand tiptoe make young man see me. "What cheapest kind tickets have, please?" I inquired, canvas bag hand. "Third class," said young man, staring hard me, I thought rather rude. "Except working men's tickets, they are train." "Two third-class tickets Victoria Dock, then, please," said I. "Single return?" said he. "I beg pardon?" I said, I puzzled. "Are coming back to-day?" he inquired. "Oh dear, no!" said I, captain's voyages lasted years; question made anxious, I knew nothing railway rules, I added, "Does matter?" "Not means," replied young man smartly, he began whistle, stopped ask, "Custom House Tidal Basin?" I alternative repeat "I _beg_ pardon?" He put his face right hole looked me. "Will take ticket Custom House Tidal Basin?" he repeated; "either Victoria Docks." "Then whichever please," said I, politely I could. The young man took two tickets snapped impatiently something; fat woman squeezing behind, I glad take I could get go back Fred. He taking care two bundles empty pie-dish. That pie-dish good deal way. Fred wanted get rid it, said he sure his mother would want us bothered it; Fred promised his letter bring back, he could break his word. I told so, I said he like seen I would carry it. So I did. With strong breeze aft, driven up-stairs teeth gale, ran high wind platform where, annoying one railway men much able guess train, ask him, got among lot rough-looking people, civil kind. A man black face white jacket said he would tell us got Custom House, he gave his seat window, I might look out. What struck rather odd everybody third-class carriage seemed bundles like ours, yet could not running away. One thin woman troublesome baby three. Perhaps portmanteaus things sort rather expensive. Fred opposite me. It bright sunny morning, fresh breeze blew, sunlight backs endless rows shabby houses looked cheerful usual, though gardens anything dirt cats, many windows week's wash hanging strings poles. The villages passed canal banks looked pretty interesting, I think places saw window train would look ugly dull day. I fancy poplar-trees place called Poplar, I thought must called them; Fred says No, never since, I cannot sure it. If not, I must dreamt it. I fall asleep corner, I know, I much tired, breakfast, I sat side wind blows in, I think helped make sleepy. I wakened partly pie-dish slipping lap, partly Fred saying eager tone, "Oh, Charlie! LOOK! _Are ships_?" We stuffed heads window, hat nearly blown away, man black face white jacket gave woman troublesome baby take care me, he held us legs fear fall out. On flew! There wind enough faces filled barge-sail three times over, Fred licked his lips said, "I believe there is salt it!" But he woke show drove nearly wild. When I seen couple big barges lying together two bare masts leaning towards I used think dignified beautiful looked. But hundreds masts, standing thick tree-trunks fir-wood, bare poles, lofty slender, crossed innumerable yards, covered ropes orderly profusion, showed sunshine cobwebs shine field summer. Gay flags pennons fluttered wind; brown sails, grey sails, gleaming white sails went down; behind water sparkled dazzled eyes like glittering reflections mirror moving sun. As ran nearer ropes looked thicker, could see devices flags. And suddenly, straining his eyes yards vessel thick ship-forest, something black, like spider four legs, Fred cried, "It is sailor!" I saw quite well. And seeing higher tree one could ever climb, sunny sky shining water him, I could mutter envious longing—"How happy he must be!" CHAPTER XIII. A DIRTY STREET—A BAD BOY—SHIPPING AND MERCHANDISE—WE STOWAWAY ON BOARD THE 'ATALANTA'—A SALT TEAR. The man white jacket helped us out, smiling he so, his teeth shone like ivory his black face. We took pie-dish bundles, thanked much, train went took it, felt sorry for. For one _is_ world, know, one sometimes feels rather lonely, sorry part kind friend. Everybody else went little gate street, same. It dirty street, houses one side railway other. There cabbages carrots old shoes fishes' heads oyster-shells potato-peelings street, goat routing among nose, lost something hoped find by. Places like always seemed depress Fred's courage. Besides which, he never good spirits he go long without food, made fear he would bear cast adrift sea without provisions well his grandfather done. I surprised he said, "_What_ place! And I do not believe one get anything fit eat, I hungry!" I looked houses. There pork-butcher's shop, real butcher's shop, slop shop, seedy jeweller's shop second-hand watches, looked nothing would ever make go, small toy sweetmeat shop, place looked like breakfast. I taken Fred's bundle he tired, I suppose I staring helplessly dirty boy good deal bigger either us came pulled his dirty hair said, "Carry things you, sir?" "No, thank you," said I, moving bundles pie-dish; boy would walk I said, "We want breakfast much, have not much money." And, remembering cost supper, I added, "Could get anything twopence-half-penny threepence apiece?" There moment's pause, boy gave long whistle. "Vy, I thought swells!" said he. I really know whether I like supposed poor person came point, whether bad habit mine even Weston's ballad quite cured me, ready tell people affairs interesting hear discreet communicate, I replied once: "We gentlemen; going search adventures, do not want spend money help till see may want get foreign countries." "You are going sea, then, _h_are you?" said boy, keeping us. "Yes," said I; "but could tell us get something eat go?" "There is shop I knows on," said new friend, "where sells prime pudding penny slice. The plums goes mistake. Three slices would threepence: one you, one him, one trouble showing way. Threepence more's quart stout, drink fair turns. Shall I take purse pay you? They might cheat stranger." "No, thank you," said I; "but like pudding show us way." The slices small, heavy. We two each. I rejected notion porter, Fred said he thirsty; I turned back shop ask glass water myself. The woman gave civilly, looking she puzzled manner, first bundles pie-dish. As she took back tumbler she nodded her head towards dirty boy, stood doorway, said, "Is young chap companion yours, dear?" "Oh, dear no," said I, "only he showed us way here." "Do not nothing him," she whispered "he is bad un." In spite warning, however, policeman seen, boy would keep us, I asked way Victoria Dock. It easy get ships I expected. There gates pass through, kept porter. He let people turned others back. "Have got order see docks?" asked boy. I confessed not, added wanted much get in. "My eyes!" said bad boy, doubling fit amusement, "I believe you are going stowaways." "What mean stowaways?" I asked. "Stowaways chaps hides aboard vessels going port, get passage free gratis nothing." "Do good many manage it?" I asked anxious mind. "There are not vessel leaves docks without one sometimes aboard. The captain never looks way, accident whatsoever. He do not lift tarpaulins ship's dock. But she gets sea captain gets his eyesight back, he takes stowaways wittles then. Oh, yes, rather so!" said bad boy. There crowd gates. "Hold bundles right side," said boy, "and go quickly respectable-looking cove see." Fred got his bundle now, followed guide's directions, went gates elderly, well-dressed man. The boy seemed try follow us, squeezing close me, gatekeeper stopped him. When side I saw bend wink backwards gatekeeper his straddled legs. Then he stood derisively his head. After he went away catherine-wheel, I saw more. We among ships last! Vessels different Mr. Rowe's barge, even three-penny steamboat, Lofty vast, shining decks marvellous cleanliness, giant figure-heads like dismembered Jins Arabian tale. Streamers many colours high forest masts, seamen many nations decks wharves below, moved idly breeze, redolent many kinds cargo. Indeed, choice ship chief care, docks warehouses would fascinated us little less shipping. Here huge bales cotton packed thickly bricks brick-field. There wine-casks innumerable, another place air aromatic large cargo coffee seemed could required country generations. It entertaining, Fred always calling look something new, mind shipping. There good deal anxiety too. The sooner chose ship "stowed away" better. I hesitated sailing-vessels steamers. I believe one captain's adventures happened board ship could move faster could sail. And yet I much attracted grand-looking steamships. Even huge funnels look power, I thought, among masts, like old hollow oaks wood young slender trees. One close dock, could see her well. There casks deck, lay piece tarpaulin caught eye, recalled bad boy said captains stowaways. Near gangway standing two men seem sailors. They respectably dressed, one book pencil, looked, I thought, might authority ask business docks, I drew Fred back shelter piled-up boxes. "When she sail?" asked man book. "To-morrow morning, sir," replied other. And crossed gangway went warehouse opposite. It noon, men's dinner-time, docks busy. At moment soul sight. I grasped Fred's arm, hoisted bundle pie-dish well own. "That is ship," I said triumphantly; "come along!" We crossed gangway unperceived. "The casks!" I whispered, made way corner I noticed. If Fred's heart beat chokingly mine did, far much excited speak, settled corner, quite cosy hiding-place forehold barge; drew tarpaulin heads, resting weight casks behind, might smothered. I waited kitchen kettle boil Fred I wanted make "hot grog" raspberry-vinegar nutmeg his father's house; I waited bonfire burn up, wanted roast potatoes; I waited leave raining mother would let us go fear catching colds; I never knew time pass slowly Fred I stowaways board steam-ship _Atalanta_. He beginning complain, heard men coming board. This amused us bit, stowed could see them, dared look out. Neither dared speak, except heard go good way off, whispered. So second second, minute minute, hour hour went by, Fred became restless. "She is sail morning," I whispered. "But get dinner tea supper?" asked Fred indignantly. I tired, felt cross account. "You said might weigh food bullet like Admiral Bligh, next week." "He must something, he could not weighed it," retorted Fred; "and know they will ever give us anything eat board ship?" "I dare say buy food first, till find us something meals," said I. "How much money left?" asked Fred. I put hand pocket canvas bag—but gone! There could little doubt bad boy picked pocket gate, I sense guiltiness it, money Fred's. This catastrophe completely overwhelmed him, he cried grumbled till I nearly wits' end. I could stop him, though heavy steps coming quite close us. "Sh! sh!" muttered I, "if go like they will certainly find us, shall managed nothing, might well gone back old Rowe." "Which wind weather permitting, young gentlemen, will," said voice us, though hear it. "I wish could," sobbed Fred, "only there is money now. But I am going get beastly hole way." "You are nice fellow tell grandfather," said I, desperate exasperation; "I do not believe you have pluck common sailor, let alone Great Discoverer." "You have hit right nail head there, Master Charles," said voice. "Fiddlesticks grandfather!" said Fred. In practical experiences last three days faith Fred's tales rather rudely shaken; contemptuous tone he disposed model, Great Sea Captain, startled severely I think I felt additional shock astonishment strong hands lifted tarpaulin heads, and—grave amid several grinning faces—we saw bargemaster. How he reproached us, Fred begged take us home, I besought let us go sea, would tedious relate. I doubt he never swerved his intention taking us back, he preferred fair means possible. So he fubbed off, took us round docks amuse us, talked dinner way went Fred's heart. But I found approaching gates more, I stopped dead short. As went docks I replied barge-master's remarks well I could, I never ceased thinking desire heart, I resolved make one passionate appeal his pity. "Mr. Rowe," I said, choking voice, "please do not take home! I would give anything world go sea. Why should not I sailor I want to? Take Fred home he wants go, tell I am right, mean duty come back credit them." Mr. Rowe's face inscrutable, I pleaded harder. "You are old navy man, know, Rowe," I said, "and recommended captain one ships cabin-boy, I will bound they would take me." "Mr. Charles," said old man earnestly, "you could not go cabin-boy, do not know—" "You think I cannot rough it," I interrupted impatiently, "but try me, see. I know I am after," I added, consequentially; "and I will bear I bear, I am set I get afloat. I will captain day, give orders instead taking them." Mr. Rowe drew attention took his hat. "And wanting able-bodied seaman circumstances, sir, voyage likes make," said he emphatically, "call Samuel Rowe." He wiped passing enthusiasm crown his head his handkerchief, continued—with judicious diplomacy he remarkable—"But course, sir, it is Royal Navy you will begin in, midshipman. It is seamanship _you_ wants learn, swabbing decks emptying buckets whilst others aloft. Your father's son would good deal place, sir, cabin-boy common trading vessel." Mr. Rowe's speech made impression, I think he saw did. "Look here, Master Charles," said he, "you have gentleman's feelings: come home now, bear widowed mother sister, sir, Master Fred's father, I am duty bound to, promised deliver safe sound return cargo, wind weather permitting." "Oh, come home! come home!" reiterated Fred. I stood speechless minute two. All around rose splendid masts, trellised rigging I longed climb. The refreshing scent tar mingled smells various cargoes. The coming going men came went fro ends earth stirred pulses restlessness. And noises coming going I heard lapping water incoming tide dock, spoke voice powerful Mr. Rowe. And yet I went him. It canvas bag empty, Fred would stay (for I begun think captain's grandson destined hero exploits ocean), Mr. Rowe spoke widowed mother Henrietta, he touched sore point conscience. I uneasy feeling first something rather mean desertion them. Pride, I hope less selfish impulse, made feel I could never quite happy—even mainmast top—if I knew I behaved ill them. I could well speak, I turned round began walk direction dock gates. Mr. Rowe behaved uncommonly kindly. He said nothing more, turned I given word command, walked respectfully behind me. I resolved look back, I not. I quite determined one thing: Mr. Rowe never able say he seen make fool I made mind. But reality I hard work keep beginning cry, Fred beginning leave off. I screwed eyes kept dry, however, went gate came sailor little bundle like ours, ship's name his hat. His hat sat gale taking off, his sea-blue shirt blown open breezes back turned upon. In spite I could one tear got eyelashes ran down, I caught lips. It bitter tear, salt salt, salt sea! CHAPTER XIV. A GLOW ON THE HORIZON—A FANTASTIC PEAL—WHAT I SAW WHEN THE ROOF FELL IN. It second day return voyage. Mr. Rowe kind, especially me. He told us tales seafaring life, related exclusively Royal Navy, unfrequently bore disparagement mercantile marine. Nowhere, perhaps, grades rank strongly marked professional discipline personal independence better combined army navy. But gulf implied Mr. Rowe youngest midshipman highest seaman officer was, I think, excess fact. As becoming cabin-boy trading vessel hopes rising captain, barge-master contrived impress idea I might well take situation boot knife cleaner Royal Kitchen, hopes proving first step towards ascending Throne. We seemed seen done much since canal before, I felt quite sentimental glided Linnet Flash. "The old place looks same, Barge-master," said I travelled air. "So do, sir," said Mr. Rowe; he added—"There is place like Home." I hardly know near town, I know getting late, dew heavy towing-path, among dark pencilled shadows sallows water full moon's reflection lay like golden shield; driver, ahead, stepped back shouted—"The bells ringing!" When got little nearer heard quite clearly, I observing red glow diffuse cold night sky willow hedge left, Mr. Rowe said, "There must queer kind echo somewhere, I heard sixteen bells." And I saw driver, whose figure stood dark moonlit moorland right, point his arm fast crimsoning sky, Mr. Rowe left rudder came forward, Fred, his head low listening, ran towards us bows cried, "There _are_ sixteen, they are ringing backwards—_it's fire_!" The driver mounted horse, put trot, hurried on. The bells came nearer nearer fantastic clanging, sky grew lurid rang. Then bend canal, caught sight two towers S. Philip S. James, dark glow. "The whole town flames!" cried Fred. "Not it," said barge-master; "it is ten one nothing rubbish-heap burning, moors fire beyond town." Mr. Rowe rather snubbed Fred, I think he curious matter. The driver urged his horse, good barge _Betsy_ swung along pace she little accustomed. When came cricket-field Mr. Rowe said—"It is middle town." Through deafening noise bells I contrived shout his ear request I might put ashore, level home. Mr. Rowe ran plank quickly landed me, without time adieux. I hastened town. The first street I got empty, seemed vibrate S. Philip's peal. And I pushed way people, hurrying I hurrying, nearer I got home thicker grew crowd ruddier became glow. And now, spite bells, I caught noises. The roar irresistible fire,—which strange likeness roar irresistible water,—the loud crackling burning wood, moving talking crowd, dense I could hardly get forward. I contrived squeeze along, however, I turned street I felt warmth fire, I looked old home mass flames. I tried get people make way saying—"It is house, please let through!" But nobody seemed hear me. And yet pause, filled curious sound crowd people gasp sigh; every man rock could impossible move backwards forwards. It dark, except moonlight, I stood, moment two flames burst bedroom windows, red light spread farther, began light faces near me. I appeal man I knew, roar began I knew fire. It roar human voices. And swelled louder, caught came along, broke deafening cheers, I wild excitement anxiety I began kick legs man front make let go home burning eyes. What he would done return, I do not know, moment crowd broke up, pushed, pressed, jostled about, people kept calling "Make way!" tumbling down, picked twice, I found front row kind lane made crowd, several men coming, carrying shoulders arm-chair people it. As passed crash, seemed shake street. The roof house fallen in! As fell flames burst upon every side, sudden glare street became bright day, every little thing one seemed spring sight. Half crowd known moment. Then I looked chair carried along; large chip one legs I knew father's old arm-chair. And chair I saw Rupert his shirt trousers, Henrietta petticoat out-door jacket, white face even firelight seemed give colour, her lap Baby Cecil his night-gown, black smut marks his nose chin. CHAPTER XV. HENRIETTA'S DIARY—A GREAT EMERGENCY. Rupert never fellow could give descriptions things, Henrietta ill time fire, Mr. Bustard said she was not talk it. But she knew I wanted know, one day she down-stairs "Miniature Room" (it Castle) she gave manuscript book, said, "It is diary, Charlie, I know will not look. But I have put two marks beginning end bit fire. I wrote evening, know, Mr. Bustard came, head got bad." Of course I made her show exactly begin leave off, I read it. This it. _"It hot day, I got rather headache gone bed. The pain kept awake good bit, I get sleep I think I slept rather lightly. I partly awakened noises seemed going head night till I could bear longer, I woke up, found people shouting outside, dreadful smell burning. I got flannel petticoat Rupert called said, 'Henny dear, house fire! Just put something round you, come quickly.' "Just outside door met Cook; she said, 'The Lord thanked! it is you, Miss Henrietta. Come along!' "Rupert said, 'Where is Mother, Cook?' "'Missus took dreadful fainting fits,' she replied, 'and they have got her the_ Crown. _We're go there, everything saved.' "'Where is Baby,' said I, 'and Jane?' "'With Ma, miss, I expect,' Cook said; came she asked one, said, 'I saw Jane door the_ Crown _just now.' I half asleep till then, got street saw smoke coming dining-room window, Rupert I wanted stay try save something, one men said, 'You brother's strong enough great use, miss; you are way engine. Everybody's best save things, you will go the_ Crown _to mamma, you will best could be.' "The people saving things saved alike. They threw window, I seen big blue china jar smashed shivers, I felt longing go show do; Rupert said, 'The fellow's quite right, Henny,' he seized hand dragged the_ Crown. _Jane hall, looking quite wild, she said us, 'Where is Master Cecil?' I did not stop ask her she did not know. I ran again, Rupert came me. I suppose looked nursery window came near, Baby Cecil standing screaming help. Before got door people seen him, two three men pushed house. They came gasping puffing without Cecil, I heard one man say, 'It is far gone. It would not bear child's weight, got you would never come again.' "'God help poor child!' said man, chemist, large family, I know. I looked round saw Rupert's face he heard. It like stone. I do not know was, seemed come head: 'If Baby Cecil burnt kill Rupert too.' And I began think; I thought back stairs. There pocket-handkerchief jacket pocket, I soaked water ground. The town burgesses would not buy new hose got new steam fire-engine, used old one burst five places, everything swimming, water laid canal. I think idea must written face, though I did not speak, Rupert seemed guess once, he ran me, crying, 'Let go, Henrietta!' I pretended hear. "When got back house fire nearly bad, got in. But though was not exactly fire were, smoke came rolling passage front house, time got back stairs could see breathe, spite wet cloths faces, eyes smarted smoke. Go fours, Henny,' said Rupert. So I did. It wonderful. When I got face close ground bit quite fresh air, smoke rolled like cloud. I could see castors legs table hall, higher up. In way saw foot back stairs, climbed hands knees. But spite bit fresh air near ground smoke certainly grew thicker, got hotter hotter, could hear roaring flames coming nearer, clanging bells outside, I never knew feel thirst then! When first flight, smoke suffocating, I heard Rupert say, 'Oh, Henny, good girl, shall ever get again!' I could not speak, throat sore, I remember thinking, 'It is like going clouds heaven; shall find Baby Cecil there.' But got rather clearer, fire lower part house then, got top stood up, found way nursery hearing Baby Cecil scream. "The great difficulty get down, could not carry keep close ground. So I said, 'You go first hands knees backwards, tell do, I will come last, he may see imitate me.' Baby good it, heat worried he stopped, Rupert said, 'Come on, Baby, Henny run you,' he scrambled good gold. "And got door people began shout cheer, I thought would torn Baby bits. It made giddy, clanging dreadful bells; I noticed Rupert limping, I said, 'Oh, Rupert, hurt knee?' he said, 'It is nothing, come the_ Crown.' _But two young men Jones's shop there, said, 'Do not walk hurt knee, sir; we will take you.' And pushed father's arm-chair, saved outside, Rupert sat down, I believe, he could stand. Then said, 'There is room you, miss,' Rupert told come, I took Baby lap; I felt ill I thought I certainly fall lifted us up. "The way people cheered made giddy; I think I shall always feel sick I hear hurrahing now. "Rupert good you are ill. He looked said, 'You are bravest girl I ever knew, do not faint help it, Baby fall out.' "I did not; I would not fainted got the_ Crown _if I could stopped anything I could do."_ CHAPTER XVI. MR. ROWE ON THE SUBJECT—OUR COUSIN—WESTON GETS INTO PRINT—THE HARBOUR'S MOUTH—WHAT LIES BEYOND. Mr. Rowe's anxiety see Rupert Henrietta, "take liberty expressing himself" saved Baby Cecil's life great, interview take place time. The barge _Betsy_ took two voyages Nine Elms home Henrietta down-stairs allowed talk fire. Rupert refused see barge-master he called ask Henrietta; he vexed people made fuss affair, Rupert vexed he gracious. When Henrietta got better, however, she said, "We ought see old Rowe thank his kindness Charlie;" next time he called, went housekeeper's room see him. He much pleased excited, always seemed make inclined preach. He set forth noble motives must moved Rupert Henrietta heroic conduct emergency, I felt proud ever. But Rupert frowned, said, "Nonsense, Rowe, I am sure I never thought anything kind. I do not believe either us thought anything all." But Mr. Rowe served seventeen years Royal Navy put he expounded point valour. "That is is, Master Rupert," said he. "It would not Miss Henrietta either had. 'A man overboard,' says you—that is enough one family, sir. _They_ never stops think 'Can I swim?' goes, stairs would not hold weight new-born babby, right raging flames." "Oh, dear!" cried Henrietta, "that is Cook kinds people say. But front stairs fire. We went back stairs, were not burning all." The barge-master smiled reply. But affability superior knowledge, I feel quite sure he always told story (and believed it) according his impossible version. It third day fire cousin called _Crown_. He never see us before, and, I said, never Castle. But next day he sent close carriage Henrietta mother, dog-cart Rupert me, brought us Castle. We three months. It Rupert went baths abroad, cured his knee completely. And then, mother could afford it, he sent grander public school Dr. Jessop's old grammar school, Mr. Johnson sent Thomas Johnson too, Tom could bear parted Rupert, his father never refused anything. But I think kind cousin his helping me. Rupert Henrietta credit family, I deserved nothing. I run away mean hope outshining them, made fool myself, whilst really great duty home. However, he back Mother going sea, got board training-ship _Albion_; highest hope chance bringing share renown father's name, his cousin may never regret helped heart's desire. Fred Johnson I good friends, since barge voyage never quite intimate. I think strongest tie us his splendid stories captain, I believe now. Oddly enough, chief friend—of whole lot—is Weston. Rupert always said I vulgar taste choice friends, seems curious old schoolmates Johnson his friend Weston mine. For Johnson's father canal-carrier, Weston fellow good family. He clever! And I habit turning pockets inside everybody see, I admire his reticence; then, though he ironical himself, well people, he fine ideas ambitions noble upright principles—when know well. "It is ill wind blows nobody good," fire burned house got Weston print last. It common letter either, "correspondence" part, small type, editor responsible. It leading article, printed big, fire Rupert Henrietta. Thomas Johnson read us, know wrote it; true, good taste. After account fire came quotation Horace, "Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis." And Johnson cried—"That is Weston, depend upon it. He is _Weekly Spectator_ last!" And then, utter amazement, came chronicle valiant deeds Rupert's ancestors Weston could got one source. What furnished his ready pen matter comic ballad punish bragging filled also honour Rupert Henrietta's real bravery, colonel father's regiment said him—it there. Weston came see day Dartmouth, training-ship _Albion_ lies, he charmed old town carved gabled houses, luxuriant gardens rich pale-blossomed laurels, frost dwarfs, crimson fuchsias gnarled age, hill-embosomed harbour, people grades ages, sexes, flit hither thither boats landlubbers would take evening stroll—that I felt somewhat justified romantic love I place. And lay one _Albion's_ boats, rocking soothing swell freshens harbour's mouth, Weston made tell lion silver chain, he called prig saying often I believe now. I remember he said, "In sleepy, damp, delightful Dartmouth, prig could deny truth poetical dream?" He declared he could see lion cave rock, poor beast wanted new sea-green ribbon. Weston speaks much cleverly I can, I could explain I still apt dream! But harbour's mouth beginning visions, stretch far sea beyond, darker line horizon ships come go. I hope wrong dream. My father modest well ambitious, good well gallant, I would rather die disgrace empty conceit unprofitable hopes. Weston religious fellow, though he "cannot" all. When I going away Dartmouth, he saw (for great friends), one last things he said was, "I say, do not leave saying prayers, know." I have not, I told last time. I often pray ever I great I may good too; sometimes I pray I try hard good God let great well. The wonderful thing old Rowe's taking cheap ticket coming see last summer. I never regret voyage _Betsy_, I thoroughly enjoy it, though I often think odd vain, jealous wild-goose chase adventures I missed chance distinguishing Great Emergency yet occurred family. A VERY ILL-TEMPERED FAMILY. "Finding, following, keeping, struggling, Is HE sure bless?" _Hymn Eastern Church._ CHAPTER I. A FAMILY FAILING. We ill-tempered family. I want say it, unsay explanations, I think good us face fact unadorned form probably presents minds friends. Amongst always admitted pieces, were, negative propositions. We allow firm disposition; know straightforward; show feel. We opinions principles own; thick-skinned good people, cold-blooded others. When two us quarrelled (and Nurse used say two us ever agreed), provocation always seemed, us, great enough amply excuse passion. But I reason think people seldom exclaimed, "What grievances poor children exasperated with!" often said, "What terrible tempers have!" There five us: Philip I eldest; twins. My name Isobel, I never allow shortened ugly word _Bella_ still hideous word _Izzy_, either servants children. My aunt Isobel never would, neither I. "The children" three. They good deal younger Philip I, always kept order. I mean taught behave wonderfully well, I mean made give way us elder ones. Among squabbled dreadfully. We ill-tempered family. CHAPTER II. ILL-TEMPERED PEOPLE AND THEIR FRIENDS—NARROW ESCAPES—THE HATCHET-QUARREL. I wish moment defend ill-temper, I think people suffer ill-tempered people often talk ones suffer matter; ill-tempered people quite enjoyed rage. And yet much misery endured never got victory ill-temper! To feel wretched exasperated little annoyances good-humoured people get shrug smile; things rankle mind like splinter flesh, glide lightly yours, leave mark; unable bear joke, knowing one doubly laughed one cannot; deadly sore heart—"I _cannot_ forgive; I _cannot_ forget," pleasure things. The tears sorrow bitter tears anger, hurt pride thwarted will. As fit passion one giddy, blind, deaf, relief overcharged mind saying sharpest things hitting heaviest blows one moment, pleasantness less momentary, almost strike foresee pains regret humbling beg pardon must ensue. Our friends always pity well blame us, though sorry possessed devils long ago. Good-tempered people, too, I fancy would find quite easy provoking, little patient forbearing, really seem sometimes irritate hot-tempered ones purpose, thought good get used it. I mean I think ill-tempered people constantly yielded to, Nurse says Mrs. Rampant servants given way Mr. Rampant till he got quite unreasonable nearly dangerous maniacs, his friends never cross him, reason would stir mad bull. Perhaps I quite know I would friends treat us cursed bad tempers. I think avoid unnecessary provocation, patient us height passion, wise well kind. But principle conceded us, rights unjustly attacked faithfully defended calm enough listen. I fancy gentle Mrs. Rampant wrong she allows Mr. Rampant think really concessions his weakness concessions his wisdom. And founded truth cannot lasting good. And if, years ago, he became sort gunpowder cask large, he asked he wished Mrs. Rampant persuade herself, Mrs. Rampant, little Rampants, servants combine persuade him, he right he wrong, wise he foolish, reasonable he unjust, I think he would said No. I believe one could deliberately desire befooled one's family best years one's life. And yet many people are! I think I ever likely loved feared I live ill-humours made laws. I hope not. But I sometimes thankful, hand, GOD forbearing us commonly other, lead us temptation worst weakest. Any one bad temper must sometimes look back years he learned self-control, feel thankful he murderer, burdened life weight his conscience calamity he because. If knife furious Fred threw his sister he petticoats hit child's eye instead her forehead, could he ever looked blinded face without pang? If blow impatient Annie flattered herself she correcting her younger brother thrown naughty little lad boat instead sailor's arms, he drowned—at ten years old murderess, could she endure life weight her unavailing remorse? I nearly killed Philip once. It makes shudder think it, I often wonder I ever could lose temper again. We eight years old, garden together. We settled build moss-house dolls, borrowed hatchet wood-house, without leave, chop stakes with. It entirely idea, I collected moss sticks. It I, too, taken hatchet. Philip tiresome helping hard part; I driven sticks leaning weight, put bits brushwood moss fell Philip laughed me, and, short, moss-house beginning look quite real, Philip anxious work it, wanted hatchet. "You would not help hard work," said I, "so I shall not give now; I will make moss-house myself." "No, will not," said Philip. "Yes, I shall," said I. "No, will not," he reiterated; "for I shall pull fast build it." "You would better not," I threatened. Just called dinner. I hid hatchet, Philip said more; he got me, I returned work I found moss-house walls, cost much labour, pulled pieces scattered shrubbery. Philip seen. My heart set upon project first I could feel overwhelming disappointment. I child often cried, I burst tears. I sobbing hardest Philip sprang upon triumph, laughing distress. "I kept promise," said he, tossing his head, "and I will go it." I sure shocks fury seize one like fit must devil possessing one. In instant eyes dry desert hot wind, head reeling passion. I ran hatchet, came back brandishing it. "If touch one stake bit moss mine again," said I, "I will throw hatchet head. I keep promises too." My intention frighten him. I relied his daring brave threat; unhappily he relied daring carry out. He took moss threw way reply. I flung hatchet!— My Aunt Isobel splendid figure, grace power one might expect her strong health ready mind. I seen her moment, I blind passion, Philip, his back turned towards her. I see distinctly she watched, one watches ball, caught hatchet within yard Philip's head. My Aunt Isobel temper much like temper rest family. When she caught her left hand she turned round boxed ears her right hand till I could see less ever. (I believe she suffered outburst months afterwards. She afraid she damaged hearing, sense often damaged destroyed blows ill-tempered parents, teachers, nurses.) Then she turned back shook Philip vigorously she boxed me. "I saw you, spiteful, malicious boy!" said Aunt Isobel. All time she shaking him, Philip looking her feet. Something he saw absorbed his attention fully he forgot cry. "You are bleeding, Aunt Isobel," said he, she gave breath enough speak. The truth this: nervous force Aunt Isobel summoned catch hatchet seemed cease caught; her arm fell powerless, hatchet cut her ankle. That left arm useless many months afterwards, abiding reproach. Philip hurt, he might killed. Everybody told often warning correct terrible temper, I might revolted reiteration facts less grave. But I never feel lightly hatchet-quarrel. It opened gulf possible wickedness life-long misery, brink temper would dragged me, Aunt Isobel's strong arm keen eye, might succeed dragging day, unless I could cure besetting sin. I never denied it. It warning. CHAPTER III. WARNINGS—MY AUNT ISOBEL—MR. RAMPANT'S TEMPER, AND HIS CONSCIENCE. I scarecrow held mind. Nurse gallery historical characters, she kept beacons warn stormy passions fate. The hot-tempered boy killed his brother school; hot-tempered farmer took his gun frighten trespasser, ended shooting him; young lady destroyed priceless porcelain pet; hasty young gentleman kicked his favourite dog broke ribs;—they warnings: old Mr. Rampant, Aunt Isobel. Aunt Isobel's story whispered tradition nursery many years she I intimate, consequence her goodness kindness me, one day I bold enough say her, "Aunt Isobel, true reason never married he quarrelled, angry, he went away, he drowned sea?" Child I was, I think I indelicate asked question I come fancy Nurse made story worse really was, behoof. Aunt Isobel cheerful bright us!—and I time able believe one could mend broken heart people's interests marks show little! My aunt clear skin, instant her face thick heavy blush, she silent. I marvelled signs displeasure she allowed herself betray, question sooner mouth I wished unsaid, felt furious she must naturally feel hear her sad sacred story bandied servants children nursery-tale moral it. But oh, Aunt Isobel! Aunt Isobel! time progressed far along hard glorious road self-conquest I hardly found way to. "I beg pardon," I began, she spoke. "You ought to," said aunt—she never spoke less decisively—"I thought tact, Isobel, tell one servants said one's sins sorrows behind one's back." "I _very_ sorry," I repeated shame; "but thing is, I did not believe true, always seem happy. I _very_ sorry." "It true," said Aunt Isobel. "Child, whilst speaking it—for first last time—let warning illustrate homely proverb: 'Do not cut nose spite face.' Ill-tempered people always it, I life-long loss. I _was_ angry him, like Jonah I said myself, 'I well angry.' And though I would die twenty deaths harder death he died see his face five minutes forgiven, I weak enough warp judgment misery. I right, he wrong. But I forgot much harder position wrong right quarrel. I think how, instead making return path difficult err, ought make easy, GOD us. I gave chance unsaying grace credit he could fail regret he said. Isobel, clear head sharp tongue, I have. You understand I say I satisfaction proving I right he wrong, I firmly, conscientiously determined make concessions, half-way advances, though Father _goes meet_ His prodigals. Merciful Heaven! I satisfaction parting slow years honest—the tenderest-hearted—" My Aunt Isobel overrated her strength. After short vain struggle silence she got went slowly room, resting her hand instant little knick-knack table door she went out—the time I ever saw her lean upon anything. * * * * * Old Mr. Rampant another "warnings." He—to whose face one dared hint he could ever wrong—would astonished Aunt Isobel learn plainly—nay, contemptuously—the servants spoke behind his back his unbridled temper results. They knew son somewhere side world, little Mrs. Rampant wept tears sent money secret, difficulty deciding why: "He would got his father's temper, stood reason he old gentleman could not put horses together." The moral obscure. From lack affection, want self-control, son condemned homelessness hardships his youth, father sonless his old age. But point Nurse's tales Mr. Rampant impressed most, even endless anecdotes his unreasonable passions leaked his back-door came back-stairs nursery. They rather amused us. That assault butcher's boy, brought ribs beef instead sirloin, he summoned fined; his throwing dinner window, going dine village inn—by dogs ate dinner he pay two dinners, buy new plates dishes. We laughed things, serious moments, especially first Sunday month, I haunted something else Nurse told old Mr. Rampant. In small parish—a dull village edge marsh—the Holy Communion celebrated month. It he irreligious old Mr. Rampant one numerous non-communicants. "It is his temper, poor gentleman," said Nurse. "He cannot answer himself, he religious feeling he would not like come unless he fit. The housekeeper overheard Mrs. Rampant a-begging last Christmas. It listening either, he bellowed her like bull, swore dreadful whatever else he he would not profane." "Could not he keep his temper week, do not think?" said I sadly, thinking mother's old copy _Weeks Preparation_ Lord's Supper. "It would bad he got one his tantrums directly afterwards," said Nurse: "and people pestering Christmas-boxes, pudding turkey, many things might go wrong, would likely he would. It is sad thing too," she added, "for his neck's terribly short, say his family gone suddenly apoplexy. It is awful thing, Miss Isobel, taken sudden—and unprepared." The awe came back every month fair white linen covered rustiness old velvet altar-cloth marsh damps rotting, silver vessels shone, village organist played non-communicants somewhat inappropriate triumphal march, little Mrs. Rampant knelt buried face went out, Mr. Rampant came us, looking glum usual, short neck! _Now_ I think poor Mr. Rampant wrong, he ought gone Mrs. Rampant Lord's Supper Christmas. He might found grace got little ups downs domestic disturbances holiday season without ferocious; he tried failed I think GOD would forgiven him. And he might—it possible he _might_—during calm solemn Communion, forgiven his son he felt Our Father forgave him. So Aunt Isobel says; I good reason think she likely right. I think _now_, _then_ I simply impressed thought ill-tempered person was, Nurse expressed it, "unfit" join highest religious worship. It true I also impressed her saying, "It is awful thing, Miss Isobel, taken sudden unprepared;" temporary compromise case. I could communicant till I confirmed. CHAPTER IV. CASES OF CONSCIENCE—ETHICS OF ILL-TEMPER. Confirmations frequent little village time. About three years Bishop came us. He came I twelve years old. Opinions divided whether I old enough, I decided matter saying I would rather wait till next opportunity. "I may fit time," thought, probably unlike Mr. Rampant's self-communings. The time came, Bishop also; I fifteen. I know why, nobody proposed Philip confirmed twelve years old. Fifteen thought quite early enough him, came confirmed together. I thankful that, happened, I Aunt Isobel talk to. "You are relieved one perplexity rate," said she, I speaking family failing also mine. "You know weak point. I remember long talk I had, years ago, Mrs. Rampant, I used know well young. She said one her great difficulties able find her besetting sin. She said always made her miserable clergymen preached subject, said every enlightened Christian must discovered one master passion amongst others his soul. She tried hard, could find lot, none much bigger much less others. Some vanity, selfishness, distrust weariness, peevishness, indolence, lapful omissions. Since she married," continued aunt, slowly pulling her thick black eyelashes, fashion she had, "I believe she found long-lost failing. It impatience Mr. Rampant, she thinks." I could help laughing. "However, Isobel, may sure this, people soft, gentle temperaments difficulties souls escape. Perhaps absence marked vices bring one open shame one might slower undertake vigorous self-improvement. You I difficulty seeing sin lying _our_ door." "N—no," said I. "Well, _have you_?" said Aunt Isobel, facing round. "Bless me," she added impetuously, "do not say have not have. Never let one else think you, child!" "If you will patience let explain—" "I am patience self!" interrupted aunt, "but I hate No means Yes." _My_ patience began evaporate. "There things, Aunt Isobel, _you know_, cannot exactly squeezed No Yes. But do not want bothered I will not say anything, I will say yes no, ever like." And I kicked shovel. (My aunt shoved poker _her_ slipper.) She drew her foot back spoke gently: "I beg pardon, dear. Please say going say, way." There doubt good-humour—like bad—is infectious. I drew nearer Aunt Isobel, fingered sleeve her dress caressingly. "You know, dear Aunt Isobel, I never think saying Rector I want say you. And I do not mean I do not agree whatever he tells us right wrong, still I think one quite convinced depths one's head, too, it is good thing, well knowing he must right." "Certainly," said Aunt Isobel. "To begin with, I do not want think better I am. When little, Philip I used spit other, pull other's hair out. I nasty unladylike things I angry, but, Aunt Isobel, 'besetting sin' conquered, it is civilized." "I quite agree you," said Aunt Isobel; rather annoyed me. I gulped down, however, went on: "The sin ill-temper, _if sin_," I began. I paused, expecting outburst, Aunt Isobel sat quite composedly, fingered her eyelashes. "Of course Rector would horrified I said thing confirmation-class," I continued, dissatisfied tone. "Do not invent grievances, Isobel, I see real stumbling-block, come it. You confirmation-class, I easily horrified." "Well, two difficulties—I explain stupidly," said I sadness. "We will take one time," replied Aunt Isobel exasperating blandness, fortunately stimulated plain-speaking. "Everybody says one ought 'restrain' one's temper, I am sure I think one ought. Is not better _have things out_? Look Philip. He is going confirmed, he will go back school, he another boy quarrel, they will fight out, feel comfortable afterwards. Aunt Isobel, I quite understand feeling friendly you have out, even you are one beaten, fair fight. Now _restraining_ temper means forcing good outside, feeling worse inside, feeling longer. There utterly stupid little schoolroom-maid, orders, I may teach her. Aunt Isobel, would credit often I tell her thing, politely she says 'Yes, miss!' invariably she does not all. I say, 'You _know_ I told yesterday. What _is_ use trying teach you?' kinds mild things like that; really I quite hate her giving much trouble taking little herself, I wish I might discharge her. Now, was not wrong throw—what things hot-tempered gentlemen always throw servants?" "Do not ask me, dear; ask Mr. Rampant." "Oh, he throws everything. Bootjacks—that is it. Now, I might throw bootjack her, would waken her up, relief feelings, I should not feel half unforgiving towards her along. Then swearing, Aunt Isobel—" "Swearing!" ejaculated aunt. "Of course swearing wrong, profane-speaking I think _would be_ help innocent kind strong language use one feels strongly." "If did not use innocent strong language calling things awful horrible element awe horror them, left great occasions," said Aunt Isobel. "Perhaps," said I, "but that is exactly I mean. Now think would wrong invent expletives mean nothing bad? As Mr. Rampant say, 'Cockatoos kingfishers! shooting-boots?' For know I think would make comfortable put way, especially he kept waiting them." I paused, Aunt Isobel turned round. "Let us carry idea well forward, Isobel. Bootjacks expletives would doubt relief thrower hurled servants one could (or principle would not) retaliate, angry feelings propelled might shortened 'letting steam,' speak. But imagine thrown bootjack Philip relieve feelings, Philip (to relieve his) flinging back you. This would give fresh impetus _your_ indignation, whatever threw next would likely soothe _his_." "Please do not!" said I. "Aunt Isobel, I could never throw hatchet again." "You bold promise stop short anywhere relieving passionate feelings indulgence begun two sides. And, dear, matters better indulgence words instead blows. In mean undignified position abusing cannot return abuse might answer; 'innocent strong language' would cease good returned. If 'Cockatoos kingfishers! shooting-boots?' equally violent voice replied, 'Bats blackbeetles! look yourself!' stronger vent steam hot temper would found, words kind would soon cease relieve feelings. Isobel, I long hard experience, ideas new ones me. Believe me, child, real relief absolute conquest, earlier battle begins, easier shorter be. If one keep irritability under, one may escape struggle death passion. I cramming principles throat—I say matter personal practice, I know, never hope find smoother shorter way. But I say also—after Victory comes Peace." I gave heavy sigh. "Thank you, Aunt Isobel, I try; makes second difficulty worse. I fancy I might possibly learn self-control; I fancy main force holding tongue, compelling speak slowly civilly: one cannot force one's feelings. Aunt Isobel, I much insulted provoked, I might keep civil years outside, I hate! You cannot prevent hating. People talk 'forgive forget.' If forgiving means harm, forgetting means behaving quite civilly, nothing happened, one could. But course it is nonsense talk making really _forget_ anything. And I think it is absurd talk making forgive, forgiveness means feeling really kindly comfortable before. The case I sure right self-control one worst way. I ought ashamed speak it—but I mean hatchet-quarrel. If I good instead wicked, restrained Philip pulled work pieces, jeered miserable, I _couldn't_ loved I before. Forgive forget! One would often glad to. I often awoke morning known I forgotten something disagreeable, come back I sorry; one's memory is not made slate, one's heart either, one take wet sponge make clean. Oh dear! I wonder ill-tempered people allowed live! They ought smothered cradles." Aunt Isobel reply, I interrupted her. "Do not think humble-minded, Aunt Isobel, I am not. Sometimes I feel inclined think ill-tempered people sense justice strict rights wrongs things—at least bad," I interpolated, thinking Mr. Rampant—"than people smile look pleasant everything everybody like Lucy Lambent, goes calling darling I know I am scowling like horned-owl. Nurse says she is 'sweetest tempered young lady she ever know!' Aunt Isobel, muddle life is!" "After years it," said aunt, pulling her lashes hard, "_I_ generally say, What muddle head is! Life much it." "I quite willing put way," sighed I, laying muddle-head table, I tired. "It comes much thing. Now—there great difficulty! I give one, cannot cure this, truth is, I fit go confirmation-class, much less Holy Communion." "Isobel," said aunt, folding her hands her lap, bending her thick brows fire, "I want clearly understand I speak great hesitation, without authority. I nothing tell I found _my_ struggles." "Thank thousand times," said I, "that is I want. You know I hear two sermons every Sunday, I lot good books. Mrs. Welment sends little book ill-temper every Christmas. The last one saying little hymn let speak whenever feel angry. Philip got hold it, made fun it. He said like recipe catching sparrow putting salt tail, cool enough say hymn, would need saying it. What think, Aunt Isobel?" "My dear, I long ago given idea everybody's weak points strengthened one plaster. The hymn might useful cases, though I confess would mine. But prayer is; I find form prayer necessary. At time I irritable taste, forms devotion give much help Prayer-Book collects Jeremy Taylor. I know may find useful hear struggle I sometimes find prayers useful, much sore point. A prayer ill-temper might tend make cross, effort join spirit temptation-tried souls ages solemn prayer Church Universal would lift petty sphere personal vexations, better going grievances even piously. I speak merely myself, mind." "Thank you," I said. "But I said hating. Aunt Isobel, ever change feelings force? Do suppose anybody ever did?" "I believe great mistake trouble one's self spiritual experiences people one cannot fully know circumstances, I will not suppose all. As I sure of, Isobel, know I speak truth." "Yes," said I; would impertinence say more. "_I_ found one fights good behaviour, GOD makes one present good feelings. I believe find so. Even child, tried good, managed control yourself, thrown hatchet, I quite sure would hated Philip long. Perhaps would thought much better Philip used behave father mother died, little elder-sisterly, motherly feeling would mixed wrath seeing his fat legs planted apart, his shoulders up, picture wilful naughtiness. Perhaps might thought repulsed little harshly he wanted help, his chief playmate twin sister." "Please do not," said I. "How I wish I had! Indeed I do not know I ever speak hating one others us, orphans. But everybody is not one's brother. And—oh, Aunt Isobel, time one get wild, hard, twisted one's heart!" "I do not think possible overrate hardness first close struggle natural passion," said aunt earnestly; "but indeed easiness after-steps often quite beyond one's expectations. The free gift grace GOD perfects efforts may come many ways, I convinced common experience Christians come." "To every one, think?" said I. "I have doubt comes you, Aunt Isobel, good." "For pity's sake do not say I good," said aunt, she kicked fire-irons; begged pardon, picked again. We silent awhile. Aunt Isobel sat upright her hands folded her lap, look her large eyes wear she trying see sides question. They dilated sorrowful earnestness she spoke again. "There _may_ souls," she said, "whose brave bitter lot conquer comfortless. Perhaps terrible inheritance strong sin father visited upon son, and, able keep his purpose pure, he falls fast he struggles up, still struggling falls again. Soft moments peace GOD man may never come him. He may feel viler thousand trumpery souls could borne his trials day. Child, reserved cross crown falling still fight, fighting fall, faces Zionwards, arms Everlasting Father. 'As one his mother comforteth' shall healing _their_ wounds." There brisk knock door, Philip burst in. "Look here, Isobel, mean late confirmation-class I am going wait you. I hate sneaking benches full, old Bartram blinking keeping place catechism his fat forefinger." "I _very_ sorry, Philip dear," said I; "please go without me, I will come quickly I can. Thank much coming remind me." "There is awful hurry," said Philip mollified tone; "I will wait down-stairs." Which he did, whistling. Aunt Isobel I demonstrative, suit us. She took hold arms, I laid head her shoulder. "Aunt Isobel, GOD help me, I fight end." "HE _will_ help you," said Aunt Isobel. I could look her face doubt it. Oh, weak soul, never doubt more! CHAPTER V. CELESTIAL FIRE—I CHOOSE A TEXT. We confirmed. As Aunt Isobel said, I spared perplexity unmistakable nature weakest point. There doubt I pray strive against. But day seemed I could never give way ill-temper again, trumpery causes former outbreaks could never even tempt so. As lines ancient hymn Holy Ghost—"_Veni Creator_"—rolled on, I prayed humbly enough unworthy efforts might yet crowned sevenfold gifts Spirit; soul sincerely longed "lightened celestial fire" could tempted common fit sulks scolding rub nursery misdeeds mischances, felt little likely hardly worth deprecating knees. And yet, service over, fatigue mental strain long kneeling standing began tell feeling came sadly near peevishness. I spent rest day resolutely room knees, hoping keep high thoughts emotions made feel happy well good. And yet I utterly broke commonplace crossness Philip I did, romped noisily others, teased looking grave tea. I break down. So much remained alive "celestial fire," I kept temper behind teeth. Long afterwards, I learnt accident Philip's "good resolve" occasion he would kinder "the little ones," I glad I indulged uncharitable impulse lecture indifference spiritual progress. That evening Aunt Isobel gave new picture room. It fine print Crucifixion, I often longed, German woodcut powerful manner Albert D¸rer, design Michael Angelo. It neither realistic mediÊval, face noble. Aunt Isobel framed, illuminated scroll written—"What wounds Thine Hands? Those I wounded house My friends." "I often think," she said, hung looking it, "that Lord's Cross Passion His patience comes home us. To patient unjust judge brutal soldiers might almost part self-respect; patience daily disappointments life 'too good world,' people say, patience follies, unworthiness, ingratitude one loves—these things daily example. For wounds house enemies pride may prepared; wounds house friends take human nature surprise, GOD teach us bear them. And reverence I think may say element difficulty His wanting. They mixed blame parts." "That put text me?" said I. My aunt nodded. I learning illuminate, I took much pride room. I determined make text myself, choose plain passage ill-temper. Mrs. Welment's books supplied plenty. I chose "Let sun go upon wrath," I resolved complete text stands Bible. It seemed fair allow remember anger always sin, I thought useful remind obstinate ill-temper I got victory quarrel, devil got victory me. So text ran full length:—"Be ye angry, sin not; let sun go upon wrath: neither give place devil." It made long scroll, I put window, fastened drawing-pins. CHAPTER VI. THEATRICAL PROPERTIES—I PREPARE A PLAY—PHILIP BEGINS TO PREPARE THE SCENERY—A NEW FRIEND. Philip school remainder year, I tried put good resolves practice children, made us peaceful household usual. When Philip came home Christmas holidays certainly pleasant moods—for ill-tempered family. Our friends allow quickness wits accompanies quickness tempers. From days young private theatricals famous little neighbourhood. I paramount nursery mummeries, children's charade parties district, Philip reliable steady help needed; school he became stage-manager theatricals there. I know he learned act much better I, I think Alice (who twelve) twice gift either us, every half he came back ingenious matters neither talent tools. He glued together yards canvas calico, produced scenes drop-curtains ambitious effective, though I thought little reckless good drawing good clothes. His glue-kettles size-pots always steaming, his paint many inappropriate objects canvas. A shilling's-worth gilding powder went long way golden crowns golden sceptres, golden chains dungeon, golden wings fairies, nursery furniture became irregularly unintentionally gilded, well nurse's stuff dress, she sat warrior's shield, drying rocking-chair. But small matters. Philip gave us wonderful account "properties" he made school theatricals. A dragon painted life, matches fixed tip boy acted life soul ungainly carcase could wag fiery tail amazed audience, striking particular scale his dragon's skin made sand-paper. Rabbit-skin masks, cotton-wool wigs wigs tow, seven-league boots, witches' hats, thunder tea-tray, phases moon moderator lamp—with things Philip enriched school theatre, though time he would take much trouble own. But last half he written three letters—and three kind ones. In latest he said that—partly he making things us, partly changes school-theatrical affairs—he bring home box valuable "properties" use Christmas. He charged prepare piece include prince disguised woolly beast two legs large fore-paws (easily shaken off), fairy godmother tow wig highest hat I could ever hope see, princess turned willow-tree (painted memory old one home), fine gnarls knots, princess could see everything, prompt (if needful), disconsolate parent, faithful attendant, acted one person, many belated travellers actor could personate bargain. These would eaten dragon right wing, re-enter belated ever left, without stopping longer required roll peal thunder back. The fifth last character dragon himself. The forest scene would wanted, I try get old cask cave. I must explain I expected write play. We never took trouble "learn parts." We generally took story pleased us _Grimm's Fairy Tales_ _Arabian Nights_, arranged various scenes. We copy arrangement, proper characters assigned us. After dialogue charade. We well accustomed act together, could trust ourselves. Only Alice's brilliancy ever took us surprise. By time Philip came home I got rough outline plot. He arrived box properties, mere size raised cheer welcome little ones, red-hot theatricals. Philip little apt red-hot projects, cool accomplished; occasion forebodings evil. Besides, he play dragon! When he fairly devote anything, he grudged trouble hesitated undertakings. He much pleased plot cave, he announced he paint new forest scene occasion. I tried dissuade him. There many things done, old scene good. But he learnt several new tricks scene-painter's trade, bent upon putting practice. So he began his new scene, I resolved work harder odds ends preparations. To driven corner pressed time always stimulated instead confusing me. I think excitement pleasant. Alice dogged way working crisis, felt quite confident able finish "at push," whatever Philip might leave undone. The theatricals Twelfth Night. Christmas passed happily whole. I found temper much oftener tried since Philip's return, he wilful fond teasing, younger ones I always deferred to. One morning busy nursery, workshop. Philip's glue-pots size-pots steaming, coloured powders every chair, Alice I laying coat invisible green cave-cask, Philip, radiant good-humour, giving distance his woodland glades artful manner powder-blue, calling us approbation—when housemaid came in. "It is _not_ lunch-time?" cried Alice. "It cannot be!" "Get away, Mary," said Philip, "and tell cook she puts meals I will paint her best cap pea-green. She is sending luncheons dinners day long now: she knows we are busy." Mary laughed, said, "It is gentleman wants see you, Master Philip," she gave card. Philip read it, waited curiosity. "It is man I met train," said he, "a capital fellow. He lives town. His father's doctor there. Granny must invite theatricals. Ask come here, Mary, show way." "Ought not go fetch yourself?" said I. "I cannot leave this," said Philip. "He will right. He is friendly possible." I must say "Granny" maternal grandmother, lived. My mother father cousins, Granny's husband impetuous race belonged. If he alive he would kept us good order, doubt. But he dead, Granny gentlest old ladies: I fear she led terrible life us all! Philip's friend came up-stairs. He _was_ friendly; fact Alice I thought forward, he several years older Philip, seemed proud acquaintance. Perhaps Alice I biased fact he spoilt pleasant morning. He one people look everything one working unintelligent eyes indifference ought dishearten one; yet does. "It is private theatricals," said Philip, Mr. Clinton's amazed stare passed paint-covered selves new scene. "My cousins Dublin private theatricals," said Mr. Clinton. "My uncle built room theatre. All fittings scenes come London, first costumiers Dublin send dresses everything required afternoon performance." "Oh, we are much smaller way," said Philip; "but I have properties do not look bad candlelight." But Mr. Clinton come cask, staring us. I knew way Alice got quietly up, shook chips decided air her apron, she like stared at. But her movement drew Mr. Clinton's especial attention. "You will catch grandmamma making mess clothes, will not you?" he asked. "I _beg_ pardon?" said Alice, perfect air heard he repeat question, she left nursery exact exit she made Discreet Princess repelling unwelcome advances last year's play. I afraid outburst Philip, said hasty civility, "This cave making." "They would splendid cave Covent Garden last Christmas," said Mr. Clinton. "It covered half stage. An enormously tall man dressed cloth silver stood entrance, waved spear ten twelve feet long his head. A fairy let that, may sure cave pretty big." "Oh, here is dragon," said Philip, rummaging property box. "He is got fiery tail." "They quite go pantomimes years ago," said Mr. Clinton, yawning. "My uncle two three—bigger that, course." Philip saw his friend interested amateur property-making, changed subject. "What morning?" said he. "I drove father, got pass gates. I say, there is splendid shooting marsh now. I want come me, we will pot wild duck two." "I have gun," said Philip, soften statement added, "there is one go with." "I will go you. And I say, could catch train back town, you will come lunch us, we will go bit afternoon look round. But must get gun." "I like fresh air," said Philip, "and you have come me—" I knew appealing tone his voice ears, face fallen. "Could I going it?" I asked, nodding towards forest scene. "Oh dear no! I will go to-night. It ought painted candlelight rights. I am going desert post," he added. "I hope not," said I good-humouredly I could; dismay heart. CHAPTER VII. A QUARREL—BOBBY IS WILLING—EXIT PHILIP. Philip came back evening train, he something eat he came nursery go scene. We got everything ready him, he worked half-an-hour. But he sleepy, cold air exercise, he paint well, he got impatient, threw up—"till morning." In morning he set work, talking time wild duck teal, price guns; time he put last night's blunders straight, front door bell rang, Mary announced "Mr. Clinton." Philip closeted his room his new friend till twelve of the clock. Then went yard, finally Mr. Clinton stayed luncheon. But I held peace, made Alice hold hers. Mr. Clinton went away afternoon, Philip got plate-powder wash-leather, occupied polishing silver fittings his dressing-case. "I think might another time, Philip," said I; "you have half-an-hour properties to-day, could clean bottles things quite well theatricals." "As happens I could not," said Philip; "I have made bargain, bargains will not wait." Alice I screamed one breath, "You are _not_ going give away dressing-case!"—for father's. "I said _bargain_" replied Philip, rubbing harder ever; "you cannot get hold gun every day without paying hard cash." "I hate Mr. Clinton!" said Alice. It unfortunate speech, declared open war; done cannot undone. There taking back sharp sayings family curse hangs tips tongues. Philip Alice exchanged pretty freely. Philip called us selfish, inhospitable, jealous. He said grudged his enjoying holidays, he working like slave us half. That disliked his friend he _was_ his friend, (not omit taunt sex) Clinton manly fellow please girls, etc., etc. In self-defence Alice much out-spoken Philip Mr. Clinton she probably intended be. That Philip began things hotly, his zeal cooled accomplished—that his imperiousness laid open flattery, necessity playing first-fiddle betrayed second-rate friendships, thrown discarded hobbies—that Mr. Clinton ill-bred, vulgarity mind would make rather proud ashamed getting best bargain his friend—these things less taunts true. If violent scenes occur ill-tempered families _felt_ half undignified miserable _look_, surely would less common! I believe Philip Alice would come blows I joined expel her room. I happy it, sympathy her side quarrel, she one declare war, I could control Philip. In short, often easy keep peace too, I like said Aunt Isobel, she home. But she away 6th. Alice defeated, I took Philip seriously task. Not his friend—the subject sore, Alice told thought, rather thought score—but theatricals. I said he really tired business would throw up, let friends know proposed entertainment fallen through, he wanted go forward he must decide help he would give, abide his promise. We came terms. If I would let day two's fun his gun, Philip promised "spurt," he called it, end. I told would content he would join "thorough rehearsal," afternoon before, devote business day performance. "Real business, know," I added, "with nobody ourselves. Nobody coming interrupt." "Of course," said Philip; "but I will that, Isobel. There is scene—" "_We'll_ finish scene," said I, "if do not aggravate Alice I lose her help well yours." Alice sulky, I could hardly wonder at, I worked alone, except Bobby, one anything like good temper among us, roasted patiently size-pot, hammered bits ivy, his fingers, rather neatly cave. But Alice impulsive kind-hearted. When I got bad headache, working long, she came round, helped me. Philip always going so, matter fact he went every day old fowling-piece he given his dressing case. When ice bore Charles also deserted us, Alice I worked steadily dresses scenery. And Bobby worked us. The 5th January arrived, day theatricals. Philip spent morning cleaning his gun, luncheon he brought nursery "finish" peculiarly aggravating air. "When shall ready rehearse?" I asked. "Oh, presently," said Philip, "there is plenty time yet. It is great nuisance," he added, "I will never anything theatricals again. They make perfect slave one." "_You've_ slaved much, rate," said Charles. "You would better give cheek," said Philip threateningly. "We have done without week, I do not know should not without to-morrow," muttered Alice corner she sewing gold paper stars Enchanted Prince's tunic. "I wish could," growled Philip, took suggestion quietly I expected; "anybody could Dragon, there is acting it!" "I will not," said Charles, "Isobel gave Enchanted Prince Woolly Beast, I shall stick part." "Could I Dragon?" asked Bobby, releasing his hot face folds old blue cloak lined red, he rehearsing his walk belated wayfarer. "Certainly not," said I, "you are Bereaved Father Faithful Attendant begin with, I hope will not muddle them. And you are Twelve Travellers well, thunder, remember!" "I do not care many I do, I can," said Bobby, drawing his willing arm across his steaming forehead. "I like fiery tail." "You cannot devour once—let alone twelve times," said I sternly. "Do not silly, Bob." It Bob I impatient reality, Philip. "If really mean desert theatricals promised, I would much rather try without you," said I indignantly. "Then may!" retorted Philip. "I wash hands whole lot you, every nursery entertainment henceforward!" he got fragments his gun together much clatter. But Charles posted door say his say, ready escape he said it. "You are ashamed it, that is it," said he; "you want sit among grown-ups spy-glass, you have got Apothecary Clinton's son friend,"—and brief insulting summary facts, Charles vanished. But Philip, white anger, quick him, top back-stairs he dealt heavy blow Charles fell head-long first flight. Alice I flew rescue. I lived dread Philip really injuring Charles day, his blows becoming serious ones he grew taller stronger, his self-control seem wax proportion. And Charles's temper becoming aggressive. On occasion, soon he regained breath, found bones broken, main force held back pursuing Philip. "I will hit him—I will stick him," he sobbed his fury, shaking his head like terrier, doubling his fists. But he rather sick fall, made lie recover himself, whilst Alice, Bobby, I laid heads together plan substitute Philip Dragon. When bed-time came, Philip still absent, became uneasy, I lay sleepless night I asked I blame sulks he gone off. In fits passion Philip often threatened go away never let us hear again. I knew things happen, made unhappy he went like this, although his threats hitherto common rather unfair device ill-temper. CHAPTER VIII. I HEAR FROM PHILIP—A NEW PART WANTED—I LOSE MY TEMPER—WE ALL LOSE OUR TEMPERS. Next morning's post brought following letter Philip:— "MY DEAR ISOBEL, "You need bother Dragon—I will it. But I wish would put another character piece. It Clinton. He says he act us. He says he anything leading part. He got black velvet knickerbockers scarlet stockings, he tunic cloak I wore last year, flap hat; must lend white ostrich feather. Make kind grandee. If cannot, he must Prince, Charles Travellers. We going marsh morning, I shall luncheon, Clinton evening. He want rehearsing, copy plan. Let Alice make it, her writing clearest, I wish she would make new one; I have torn mine, dirty, I shall never able read inside Dragon. Do not forget. "Your affectionate brother, "PHILIP." There limits one's patience, us wide. Philip passed bounds mine, natural indignation heightened sort revulsion last night's anxiety his account. His lordly indifference people's feelings irritating trouble he gave us changing his mind. "You will not let take Woolly Beast me, Isobel?" cried Charles. "And know promised lend _me_ ostrich plume." "Certainly not," said I. "And shall feather. I promised." "If Mr. Clinton acts—I shall not," said Alice. "Mr. Clinton will not act," said I, "I cannot alter piece now. But I wish, Alice, always ready drive things quarrel." "If had not given way Philip much he would not think bear anything," said Alice. I could feel truth this, dilemma provided Aunt Isobel's teaching, one may obliging one lives encourage, teach selfish. Perhaps would well first day Philip deserted us Alice I, spent afternoon Lucy Lambent, continued amuse friends Philip amused his. We forced common decision whether play given up, and, without reproaches counter-reproaches, Philip would learned he could leave work us, arrange disarrange plot his pleasure, rather, he would never thought he could. But plan kind requires carried perfect coolness either justifiable effective. And cool head amongst us. One thing clear. I ought keep faith others worked Philip would not. Charles turned his part. I rather hustled question new part Mr. Clinton mind. I disliked him, want introduce him. I said quite unreasonable—out question fact—and I prepared say Philip. Of course he furious—that I knew he would be; I firm. "Charles Old Father, Family Servant too," said he. "They are good parts." "Then give Mr. Clinton," said I, well knowing he would not. "Charles taken great deal pains his part, his holidays well yours, Prince shall taken him." "Well, I say shall. And Charles may uncommonly glad I let act way he behaved yesterday." "The way _you_ behaved, you, mean," said I—for temper slipping grasp;—"you might broken his neck." "All danger his provoking me, encouraging him." I began feel giddy, always bad sign us. It rang mind's ear came forbearing bully like Philip. But I still tried speak quietly. "If think," said I teeth, "that I going let knock others about, rough-ride theatricals, mistaken." "_Your_ theatricals!" cried Philip, mimicking me. "I like that! Whom properties belong to, pray?" "If goes buying," reply rather difficult question, "most belong Granny, canvas paints stuff dresses, gone bills; goes work, I think done quite much you. And properties _are_ yours, play mine. And scene—you distance middle wood, Alice I painted foreground." "Then may keep foreground, I will take distance," roared Philip, moment his pocket-knife open, he cut hole foot-and-a-half square centre Enchanted Forest, Bobby's amazed face (he running tuck his cloak behind scenes) appeared aperture. If kind word would saved fruits week's hard labour, one us would spoken it. We sacrifice anything possess ill-tempered family—except wills. "And may take play, I will take properties," continued Philip, gathering hats, wigs, costumes Alice I arranged neat groups ready green-room. "I will give everything Clinton evening his new theatre, we will see get without Fiery Dragon." "Clinton _can't_ want fiery dragon he is got you," said Charles, voice mock compliment. The Fairy Godmother's crabstick Philip's hand. He raised it, flew Charles, I threw caught Philip's arm. "You shall hit him," I cried. Aunt Isobel right one thing. If one _does_ mean stop short quarrel one must begin early stage. It easier smother one's feelings check one's words. By time comes blows like trying pull runaway horse. The first pinch Philip gave arm set brain fire. When he threw heavily cave mocking laugh, sprang Charles, I could yielded inch save life—not earn Fortunatus' purse, three fairy wishes—not save whatever I valued. What would induced me? I know, I know I glad quite easy sell one's soul one bargain fairy-tales make out! My struggle Philip given Charles time escape. Philip could find him, rough words he returned me, I fancy cost effort self-control, betrayed Alice's instinct mine he would glad get extremity tempers driven matters. "Look here!" said he tone would perfect acting costermonger his wife. "Are going make Clinton Prince not?" "I not," said I, nursing elbow, cut nail cask. "I going anything whatever Mr. Clinton, I ought cured working you." "You lost opening make peace," said inner voice. "You have given yielding plan fair trial, failed," said self-justification—the swiftest pleader I know. "There people, self-satisfied, arbitrary tempers, upon gentleness worse wasted, misleads them. They remnant savage notions drives mistake generosity weakness. The way convince hit harder hit you. And kindest plan everybody concerned." I bound say—though rather confuses ideas—that experience convinced last statement without truth. But I also bound say really applicable Philip. He generous Alice, I good reason believe kindly concession would wasted him. When I flung last defiance, Philip replied violent words kind girls class life (happily!) use, even rage. They partly drowned clatter he dragged his big box across floor, filled properties kinds, Dragon foot-light reflectors. "I going 4.15 town," said he, he pulled box towards his room. "You need wait either Clinton me. Pray 'ring up' punctually!" At moment—having fully realized downfall theatricals—Bobby burst howl weeping. Alice scolded crying, Charles reproached her scolding him, score her antipathy Mr. Clinton driven Philip extreme point insult ill-temper. Charles's conduct far soothing, Alice abundant material retorts, she likely loser war words. What she say I hear, time I locked room. CHAPTER IX. SELF-REPROACH—FAMILY DISCOMFORT—OUT ON THE MARSH—VICTORY. If I could locked anywhere else I preferred it. I would justified part present family quarrel Aunt Isobel herself, yet I would rather alone text I made pinned up, new picture. However, nowhere else go to. A restless way I pacing I rage, often reminded habits ferocious wild beasts Zoological Gardens, lessened convictions subject family temper. For prowls den I managed occupy thoughts fuming Philip's behaviour, first flush anger began cool, keeping head painful reflections sight text, picture, books suggested—the miserable contrast good resolves result. "It shows," I muttered myself, voice amiable growlings panther, "it shows quite hopeless. We are ill-tempered family—a hopelessly ill-tempered family; try cure us like patching lungs consumptive family, I do not even wish I _could_ forgive Philip. He does not deserve it." And I nursed cut elbow, recalled long hours work properties, damaged scene, rifling green-room, Philip's desertion Dragon, his probable industry Mr. Clinton's theatricals, way he left us face disappointed audience, fierce indignation got upper hand more. "I do not care," I growled afresh; "if I lost temper, I believe I right lose it—at least, one could expected lose it, I never beg his pardon it, let Aunt Isobel say she will. I hate ever I did, injustice thing. Pardon, indeed!" I turned top room paced back towards window, towards long illuminated text, "—— Noble face, So sweet full grace," bent unchangeable emblem suffering self-sacrifice. I trick talking inanimate objects. I addressed text picture. "But I do not," I continued, "if confirmed Philip autumn, come one old catastrophes next holidays, bad ever, spiting last—I shall take to-morrow! I do not pretend able persuade black white—like Mrs. Rampant; I hypocrite, I will not ornament room texts, crosses, pictures, symbols Eternal Patience, I even mean _try_ sacrifice myself, patient." It curious one's faith practice hang together. I felt doubtful whether even desirable I should. Whether misunderstand GOD'S will, thinking well people right ever sacrifice wrong. I however hide myself, say unsay resolves besetting sin. I decided take texts, pictures, books, grimly thought I would frame fine photograph Charles given lioness, would make new inscription, motto old Highland Clan Chattan—with family remotely connected—"_Touch cat glove_."[1] [Footnote 1: _AnglicË_ "without glove."] "Put gloves next time, Master Philip!" I thought. "I shall make feeble attempts keep claws, tempt irritate beyond endurance. We are ill-tempered family, you are amiable member it. For part, I control temper running away me, fairly kind little ones, long I tell them. But, crisis like this, I yield unreasonable wishes, stifle anger, apologize little wrong owe apologies big one, pave way peace broken will, leopard change his spots." "And yet—_if I could_!" It broke almost like cry, "If besetting sin _is_ sin, I given way provocation—if moment hardest battle, day almost lost—and now, even now, I could turn round tread Satan feet. If to-morrow morning, I done it—O soul, triumph, satisfaction past prayers, hope future! "Then thou shouldest believe old legends sinners numbered saints, tyrants taught gentle, unholy learning pure—for one believes heartiness he experienced—then text picture cross hang on, spite frailty, sign shalt thou conquer." One ought thankful blessings good health strong nerves, I sometimes wish I could cry easily. I like like poor Mrs. Rampant, whose head back always aching, whose nerves make think strings ∆olian harp, Mr. Rampant, like rude Boreas, perpetually playing tones his voice, creak his boots, bang his doors. But her tears relieve, exhaust her, back-ache cannot bad heart-ache—hot, dry heart-ache, cold, hard heart-ache. I think I could cried I could felt softer. As I began wish I could I felt sure I could not. If I dragged Philip, got conciliatory words, I break worse fury he sneered rode high horse, "as he probably would," thought I. On little carved Prayer-book shelf lay volumes copy ¿ Kempis, belonged mother. Honesty already whispered I deliberately gave fight evil must banished texts pictures. At present moment familiar passage came head: "When one great anxiety mind, often wavering fear hope, humbly prostrate prayer, said, 'O I knew I persevere!' he presently heard within answer GOD, said, 'If thou didst know it, would'st thou do? Do thou would'st then, thou shalt safe.'" Supposing I began right, trusted rest? I could try speak Philip, would something even I stopped short ran away. Or I could drag feet him, I could take Aunt Isobel's advice, pray. I might able speak civilly Philip, even pray present state mental confusion, I could repeat _some_ prayer reverently. Would better start right road, even I fell way? I crossed room three strides place I usually say prayers. I knelt, folded hands, shut eyes, began recite Te Deum head, trying attend it. I attend pretty well, mere attention, till I felt slightly softened verse—"Make numbered Thy saints glory everlasting." For young mother good, I always think her choir comes verse Sundays. "Vouchsafe, O Lord, keep us day without sin." "It is late ask that," thought I, half brain attending words Te Deum, "and yet little bit day left dedicated either good evil." I prayed rest, "O Lord, mercy upon us, mercy upon us. O Lord, let Thy mercy lighten upon us, trust Thee. O Lord, Thee I trusted, let never confounded!" last verse came heart passion desire strength GOD sacrifice own. I flung floor inarticulate prayers fully point now, summed old words, "In Thee, O Lord, I trusted, let never confounded!" When I raised head I caught sight picture, instant felt superstitious thrill. The finely drawn face shone crimson glow. But moment I saw because, exclaimed—"_The sun setting_! I must speak Philip goes down." What I say? Somehow, now, judgment felt clear decisive. I would pretend he right, I would acknowledge I wrong. I _had_ disobliging Mr. Clinton, I would say so, offer repair matter. I would regret lost temper, say nothing his. I would offer deprive Charles his part, break promise white feather; I would make new part Mr. Clinton, he quite welcome finery possession except Charles's plume. This concession difficulty me. Bad tempers are, I thankful say mean ones. If I dressed Mr. Clinton all, would come natural liberally. I would this—_if I could_. I might break passion mere sight Philip properties, least I would begin "as I knew I persevere." At moment front door shut bang shook house. It Philip going catch 4.15. I bit lips, began pull boots, watching red sun sank waste marshland I could see window. I must try overtake him, I could run well, I suspected he would walk fast. I believe he really pleased break-up plans prospect public exposure squabbles, though family always willing make fools rather conciliate other. My things soon on, I hurried room. In window-seat corridor Alice. The sight her reproached me. She slept room, I jealously retained full power it, I locked she dared disturb me. "I am afraid you have wanting come in," said I. "Do go now." "Thank you," said Alice, "I have nowhere go to." Then tightening her lips, she added, "Philip's gone." "I know," said I. "I am going try get back." Alice stared amazement. "You always spoil Philip, he is twin," she said, last; "you would not me." "Oh, Alice, do not know. I would much rather you, girls much less aggravating boys. But do not try make harder make peace." "I beg pardon, Isobel. If do, you are angel. I could not, save life." At head stairs I met Charles. "He is gone," said he significantly, bestriding balustrades, he shot foot. When I reached he pinching biceps muscle his arm. "Feel, Isobel," said he, "It is hard, is not it?" "Very, Charles, I am hurry." "Look here," he continued, ugly expression his face, "I am going training. I am going eat bits raw mutton, dumb-bell. Wait year, wait half year, I shall able thrash him. I will make remember theatricals. I do not forget. I have not forgot his bursting football spite." It pleasant see one's sins reflected faces. I could speak. By front door Bobby. He way looking portico window, his swollen eyes could possibly seen anything. "Oh, Isobel, Isobel!" he sobbed, "Philip's gone, taken D—d—d—dragon him, we are m—m—m—miserable." "Do not cry, Bobby," said I, kissing him. "Finish cloak, anything can. I am going try bring Philip back." "Oh, thank you, thank you, Isobel! If he will come back I do not care I do. Or I will give parts he wants them, scene-shifter, you will lend carpet-slippers, make paper cap." "GOD given sweet temper, Bobby," said I, solemnly. "I wish I one like it." "You are good gold," said Bobby. His loving hug added strength resolutions, I ran across garden jumped ha-ha, followed Philip marsh. I know whether he heard steps I came nearly him, I fancy his pace slackened. Not he looked round. He much sulky. Philip good-looking boy, much handsomer I am, though alike. But family curse disfigures his face he cross one's, back view almost worse front. His shoulders get humped up, his whole figure stiff cross-grained obstinacy. "I shall never hold he speaks ungraciously he looks," thought I despair. "But I will give till I hold longer." "Philip!" I said. He turned round, his face prettier look his shoulders. "What want?" (in costermonger tone.) "I want come back, Philip"—(here I choked). "I dare say," he sneered, "and want properties! But you have got play, amiable Charles, talented Alice, ubiquitous Bobby. And audience entertained unexpected after-piece entitled—'The disobliging disobliged.'" Oh _was_ hard! I think I looked Philip's face I must broken down, I kept eyes steadily crimson sun, loomed large marsh mists lay upon horizon, I answered justifiable vehemence: "I bad temper, Philip" (I checked disposition add—"and you"), "but I never tell lie. I _not_ come properties. The reason I come try make peace." At point I gathered strength hurried on, staring sun till bushes near us level waste marsh beyond seemed vanish glow. "I came say I sorry share quarrel. I lost temper, I beg pardon that. I obliging Mr. Clinton, tried much. However, wrong, excuse me, I know, like come back, I will make new part wanted. I cannot give Charles's part, feather, anything I do, give own, I will. It is to-night, know well I I care twopence happens I am angry, and, all, say you have taken things. But I wanted us get holidays without quarrelling, I wanted enjoy them, I want try good you, twin brother, share quarrel I beg pardon—I more." Some speech pleasant say eating cinders, done I felt sudden sensation (very rare me) unendurable fatigue. As last words left lips sun set, eyes bedazzled I sure I fallen, unexpected support. What Philip thinking speech I know, I avoided looking him, done he threw properties his arms, flung around hug Polar bear. _"You_ ill-tempered!" he roared. "You have temper angel, would never come like this. Isobel, I brute, I behaved like brute week, I beg _your_ pardon." I retract wishes crying, I begin, I cry disagreeable way—no spring shower, perfect tempest tears. Philip's unexpected generosity upset me, I sobbed till I frightened him, he said I hysterical. The absurdity idea set fits laughing, which, oddly enough, seemed distress much I stopped last, found breath say, "Then you will come home?" "If you will me. And never mind Clinton, I will get it. The truth is, Isobel, Alice snub first, vexed me; I _am_ disappointed him. He brag so, I have take fowling-piece gunsmith's already, I know it is worth. I give Clinton hint it, and—would believe it?—he laughed, said he thought he got best _that_ bargain. I said, 'I hope have, is not even one, I sorry think _I_ cheated friend!' But he either would not see it. He is second-rate sort fellow, I am sure, I am sorry I promised let act. But I will get it, shall not bothered him." "No, no," said I, "if promised I would much rather. It will not bother all." (It certainly much pleasanter kind dispute struggle give, take!) "You cannot fit now?" said Philip doubtfully. "Oh yes, I can." I felt sure I could. I often short temper amusements, never ideas. Philip tucked properties one arm, other, ran homewards marsh, I threaded Mr. Clinton plot perfect ease. "We will second Prince, he shall enchanted shield, shall protect you—though he cannot kill you—for Charles must that. He shall love Princess too, he Charles going fight her, Fairy Godmother shall sprinkle Waters Memory, break spell made forget his Princess distant land. You know, Philip, he _does_ act well, he may make capital part it. It splendid scene. We two real metal swords, flashing air—enter Fairy carved claret jug. When he sprinkled he must drop his sword, put his hands his head. He recall picture his Princess, draw kiss (I lend locket miniature great-grandpapa). Charles he must swear eternal friendship, he pick his sword, exit right centre, waving golden shield, find his Princess. It look well, he goes Princess enter left distraction combat, she Charles fall other's arms, blessed Fairy." "Capital!" said Philip. "What head have! But you are breath? We are running fast." "Not bit," said I, "it refreshes me. Do remember I used run hand hand top bottom Breakneck Hill? Oh, Philip, I wish could never quarrel more! I think might keep tempers tried." "_You_ might," said Philip, "because good. But I shall always brute." (Just _I_ said Aunt Isobel! Must every one learn his lessons himself? I sort unreasonable feeling experience ought serve rest ill-tempered family bargain.) Philip's spirits rose higher higher. Of course he delighted scrape. I sure he glad friendly again, he hotter ever theatricals. So I. I felt certain would successful now. But far beyond comfort things "coming right," pleasure anticipated fun, heart rocked higher peace. In small religious experiences I never known triumph, thankfulness before. Circumstances, self-control, helped previous quarrels; I never really done battle, gained conquest besetting sin. Now, however imperfectly awkwardly, I yet _had_ fought. If Philip less generous I might failed, effort real—and successful. Henceforth soul fight prestige victory, courage comes striven won, trusted confounded. The first person met got Aunt Isobel. She arrived absence. No doubt she heard whole affair, she good, never _gauche_ she said— "Here come stage-managers! Now I help? I tea, ready obey orders till curtain rings up." Boys carry things well. Philip got red, I said—"Oh, please come nursery, Aunt Isobel. There lots things do." She came, invaluable. I never said anything row her, she never said anything me. That I call friend! The first thing Philip unlock property-box his room bring Dragon things back. The second thing he mend new scene replacing bit he cut out, glueing canvas behind it, touching paint joined. We soon put straight disarranged. Blinds drawn, candles lighted, seats fixed, theatre began look like itself. Aunt Isobel I bringing footlights, saw Bobby extreme right stage wrapped his cloak, contemplating, apparent satisfaction, twelve old hats six pasteboard bandboxes spread him. "My dear Bobby, these?" said Aunt Isobel. Bobby hastily—almost stammeringly—explained, "I Twelve Travellers, know, Aunt Isobel." "Dear me!" said Aunt Isobel. "I will show I going it," said Bobby. "Here twelve old hats—I work collect them!—and six bandboxes." "Only six?" said Aunt Isobel commendable gravity. "But lids," said Bobby; "six them, six boxes, make twelve, know. I have one cloak, it is red one side blue other, two kinds buttons. Well; I come left First Traveller, cloak red side out, white chimney-pot hat." "Ah!" said Aunt Isobel. "And one bandboxes cloak. The Dragon attacks centre, drives right, I smash bandbox, sounds like crunching bones. Then I roll thunder, turn cloak blue side, put wideawake, come bandbox lid crunch that, roll thunder, on. I am Faithful Attendant Bereaved Father well," added Bobby, justifiable pride, "and I would done Dragon would let me." But even Bobby outdo rest us willingness. Alice's efforts obvious tokens remorse; she waited Philip, attentive Mr. Clinton (who, I think, day believes he made especially acceptable "the young ladies"), surpassed herself stage. Charles "come round" quickly, last moment he came offered yield white plume. I confess I rather vexed Mr. Clinton accepting it, Alice I despoiled best hats black ostrich feathers make Charles, he said, dignity, he never offered white one he meant accepted. One thing took us surprise. We trouble dressing new Prince costumes make-up rest characters together cost—he torn big looking-glass his "call" stage, and, amazement, he seemed decidedly unwilling go on. "It is odd thing, Miss Alice," said he accents pitiable I wonder Alice her best encourage him,—"it is extraordinary thing, I feel quite nervous." "You will right you are on," said Alice; "mind do not forget depends explain it is invincible shield." "Which arm I better wear on?" said Mr. Clinton, shifting nervously side side. "The left, left!" cried Alice. "Now ought on." "Oh shall I say?" cried new hero. "Say—'Devastating Monster! arm mortal, sword forged human fingers, shield invincible ——'" "Second Prince," called Charles impatiently, Mr. Clinton hustled on. He greeted loud applause. He said afterwards put his part his head, Alice told wrong, shield small him. As matter fact he hammered stammered got piece confusion, Philip lost patience he lay awaiting his cue. With fierce bellow he emerged his cask, roaring, "Avaunt, knight invincible shield craven heart!" he crossed stage full clatter his canvas joints, chased Mr. Clinton left centre. Once behind scenes, he refused go again. He said he never played without proper part his uncle's Dublin, thought plan quite mistake. Besides which, he got toothache, preferred join audience, he did, play went without him. I acting stage-manager intervals part, I noticed Mr. Clinton (not ex-Prince, his father, surgeon) get up, hastily leave his place among spectators. But I wondering this, I recalled business delay part Bobby, ought (with lights down) Twelfth Traveller. I found left wing, twelve hats fitted one another, whole pile resting chair. "Bob, after? You ought on." "All right," said Bob, "Philip knows. He is lashing his tail business till I am ready. Help put cushion cloak hump-back, you? I did not like twelfth hat, it is like third one, I am going Jew Pedlar. Give box. Now!" And I could speak roar applause greeted Bobby he limped his twelve hats, crying, "Oh tear, oh tear! dish ish tarkest night I ever shaw." But either acted unusually well, audience exceptionally kind, applauded everything everybody till curtain fell. * * * * * "Behind scenes" always place confusion amateur theatricals; least used us. We ran hither thither, lost every-day shoes, washed paint faces, mislaid number towels, combs, brushes, ate supper snatches, congratulated successful evening, kissed around Granny, came behind scenes purpose. All over, guests gone, I gave invitation others come make lemon-brew bedroom fire appropriate concluding festivity. (It suggested Bobby.) I seen Philip time, astonished hear he gone out. We kept his "brew" hot him, Charles Bobby nodding—though stoutly refused go bed,—when his step sounded corridor, he knocked came hastily in. Everybody roused up. "Oh, Philip, we have wondering were! Here is brew, we have kept little drop, drink good health." ("Mine _all_ pips," observed Bobby parenthesis.) But Philip evidently thinking something else. "Isobel," he said, standing table, he making speech, "I shall never forget coming to-day. I told temper angel." "So I," said Alice. "Hear! hear!" said Bobby, sucking his pips one one laying by—"to plant pot," he afterwards explained. "You saved theatricals," continued Philip, "you saved life I believe." No "situation" play half startling this. We remained open-mouthed silent, whilst Philip sat he tired, rested his head his hands, dirty, stained something red. "Have not heard accident?" he asked. We said "No." "The 4.15 ran express lines cross, know. Isobel, _there two first-class carriages, everybody killed one man_. They taken his legs off, he is expected live. Oh, poor fellow, he groan so!" Bobby burst passionate tears, Philip buried his head his arms. Neither Alice I could speak, Charles got went round stood Philip. "You have helping," he said emphatically, "I know have. You are good fellow, Philip, I beg pardon saucing you. I going forget football too. I going eaten raw meat, dumb-belled, make strong enough thrash you," added Charles remorsefully. "Eat butcher's shop full, like," replied Philip contempt. And I think showed Charles beginning practise forbearance, he made reply. * * * * * Some years passed since Twelfth Night theatricals. The Dragon long dissolved his component scales, never impromptu performances now. The passing fame terrible railway accident gave insignificant station also faded. But set seal good resolutions I may honestly say lightly broken. There, spot I almost resolved never forgive Philip, never try heal miserable wounds family peace, I learned news accident he might killed. Philip says anything could make behave better thought I saved his life, he calls it. But anything could help good him, surely must remembrance nearly I save him. I put Alice equality bedroom night, gave her part-ownership text picture. We happy together. We tried improve, I think I may say fairly successful. More I heard (one hear many things people say behind one's back) new acquaintances—people known us lately—have expressed astonishment, unmixed generous indignation, hearing ever described friends as—A VERY ILL-TEMPERED FAMILY. OUR FIELD. Though nothing bring back hour Of splendour grass, glory flower; We grieve not, rather find Strength remains behind, In primal sympathy Which, been, must ever be. * * * * * And, O ye fountains, meadows, hills, groves, Think severing loves! Yet heart hearts I feel might; * * * * * Thanks human heart live, Thanks tenderness, joys, fears: To meanest flower blows give Thoughts often lie deep tears. _Wordsworth_. OUR FIELD There four us, three us godfathers godmothers. Three each. Three times three make nine, fairy godmother lot. That vexed us. It provoking, knew well wanted one, she given us three wishes each. Three times three make nine. We could got wanted nine wishes, provided Perronet bargain. It would good Perronet wishes himself, he dog. We never knew drowned Perronet, Sandy saved his life brought home. It he coming home school, he brought Perronet him. Perronet nice look first saw him, though sorry him. He wet over, his eyes shut, could see his ribs, he looked quite dark sticky. But he dried, he dried lovely yellow, two black ears like velvet. People sometimes asked us kind dog he was, never knew, except he nicest possible kind. When got him, afraid going allowed him. Mother said could afford him, tax his keep. The tax five shillings, wanted nearly year time paying it. Of course his keep began soon he could eat, evening. We miserable, fond Perronet—at least, Perronet his name then, he person—and last settled three us would give sugar, towards saving expense his keep, he might stay. It hardest Sandy, he particularly fond sweet things; he particularly fond Perronet. So gave sugar, Perronet allowed remain. About tax, thought could save pennies half-pennies got year, long time time paying, almost sure enough then. We money time, bought savings-box; lots people save money stockings, settled would. An old stocking would do, holes, I many good pairs; took one winter ones use summer, thought could pour money one good summer ones winter came. What wanted fairy godmother "homes." There kind play liked better playing houses new homes. But matter made "home," sure disturbed. If indoors, made palace big table, soon ever got nicely divided rooms according legs came, certain dinner-time, people put feet it. The nicest house ever out-house; it, kept quite secret, weeks. And new load wood came covered everything, best oyster-she will dinner-service all. Any one see impossible really fancy anything constantly interrupted. You cannot fun railway train stopping stations, take carriages pieces chairs wanted tea; play properly Grace Darling life-boat, say old cradle good knocked way. It always same. If wanted play Thames Tunnel beds, allowed; day Aladdin store-closet, old Jane came would put away soap, Aladdin could possibly got door cave open. It one day early May—a hot day time year, made us rather cross—when Sandy came four of the clock, smiling broadly even usual, said Richard me, "I have got fairy godmother, she is given us field." Sandy fond eating, especially sweet things. He used keep back things meals enjoy afterwards, he almost always piece cake his pocket. He brought piece now, took large mouthful, laughing us his eyes top it. "What is good field?" said Richard. "Splendid houses it," said Sandy. "I am quite tired fancying homes," said I. "It is good; always get turned out." "It is quite new place," Sandy continued; "you have never there," he took triumphant bite cake. "How get there?" asked Richard. "The fairy godmother showed me," Sandy's reply. There thing nursery honour. We respected other's pretendings unless cross, I did not disbelieve his fairy godmother. I said, "You should not talk mouth full," snub making secret his field. Sandy good-tempered. He laughed said, "Come along. It is much cooler now. The sun's going down." He took us along Gipsy Lane. We twice, walks, often, horrid story rather frightened us. I know was, horrid one. Still there, I knew quite well. At end stile, go field, end get another stile, find high road. "If field, Sandy," said I, got first stile, "I am sorry, really will not do. I know lots people come it. We never quiet here." Sandy laughed. He did not speak, he did not get stile; he went gate close leading little sort bye-lane mud winter hard cart-ruts summer. I never it, I seen hay sort thing go come it. He went followed him. The ruts disagreeable walk on, presently he led us hole hedge, got field. It bare-looking field, went rather uphill. There path, Sandy walked away it, went him. There another hedge top, stile it. It rough posts, one much longer other, cross step gone, two rails, climbed over. And got side, Sandy leaned big post gave wave his right hand said, "This field." It sloped hill, hedges round rather high, awkward branches blackthorn sticking without leaves, blossom lying white black twigs like snow. There cowslips field, thicker lower end, damp. The great heat day over. The sun shone still, shone low made splendid shadows walked grey giants feet; made bright green grass, cowslips below, top hedge, Sandy's hair, everything sun mist behind elder bush sun, yellow—so yellow—that minute I really believed Sandy's godmother, thought story come true, everything turning gold. But minute; course I know fairy tales true. But lovely field, put hands eyes good look it, I said Sandy, "I beg pardon, Sandy, telling talk mouth full. It best field I ever heard of." "Sit down," said Sandy, honours; sat hedge. "There violets behind us," he continued. "Cannot smell them? But whatever do, do not tell anybody those, shall not keep field day. And look here." He turned his face, Richard I same, whilst Sandy fumbled among bleached grass brown leaves. "Hyacinths," said Richard, Sandy displayed green tops them. "As thick peas," said Sandy. "This bank blue weeks; fiddle-heads everywhere. There end ferns. May extent—it is bud yet—and there is wren's nest there——" At point he rolled suddenly his back looked up. "A lark," he explained; "there one singing head off, morning. I say, Dick, good field kite, will not it? _But wait bit_." After every fresh thing Sandy showed us field, he always finished saying, "_Wait bit"_; always something else better still. "There is brook bottom there," he said, "with lots fresh-water shrimps. I wonder whether would boil red. _But wait bit_. This hedge, see, got high bank, it is worn kind ledges. I think could play 'shops' there—_but wait bit_." "It is almost _too_ good, Sandy dear!" said I, crossed field opposite hedge. "The best come," said Sandy. "I have good mind let till to-morrow." And distraction he sat middle field, put his arms round his knees, playing "Honey-pots," rocked backwards forwards face brimming satisfaction. Neither Richard I would mean explore account, field Sandy's discovery, tried hard persuade show us everything. He provoking way laughing holding his tongue, he now, besides slowly turning his pockets inside-out his hands, mumbling crumbs odd currants, saying, "Guess!" every mouthful. But crumb left seams his pockets, Sandy turned back, jumping up, said—"One tell secret once. It is hollow oak. Come along!" He ran ran, side Our Field. I read hollow oaks, seen pictures them, I dreamed one, witch inside, never one play in. We nearly wild delight. It looked solid field, pushed behind, hedge side, door, I crept in, smelt wood, delicious damp. There could perfect castle, though windows sides, light came top, polypody hung like fringe. Sandy quite right. It best thing Our Field. Perronet fond field were. What he liked little birds. At least, I do not know he liked them, he chiefly attended to. I think he knew field, thought he watch-dog it, whenever bird settled anywhere, he barked it, flew away, he ran barking till he lost it; time another settled down, Perronet flew him, on, hedge. He never caught bird, never would let one sit down, he could see it. We kinds games Our Field. Shops—for quantities things sell—and sometimes I moss-merchant, ten different kinds moss brook, sometimes I jeweller, sold daisy-chains pebbles, coral sets made holly berries, oak-apple necklaces; sometimes I kept provisions, like earth-nuts mallow-cheeses, mushrooms; sometimes I kept flower-shop, sold nosegays wreaths, umbrellas made rushes, I liked kind shop, I fond arranging flowers, I always make birthday wreaths. And sometimes I kept whole lot shops, Richard Sandy bought things, paid money made elder-pith, sliced rounds. The first shop I kept sell cowslips, Richard Sandy lived brook, wine merchants, made cowslip wine tin mug. The elder-tree beauty. In July cream-coloured flowers sweet, could hardly sit it, autumn covered berries; always little disappointed never tasted least like elderberry syrup. Richard used make flutes stalks, one really play tunes on, always made Perronet bark. Richard's every-day cap large hole top, Our Field always hung top tallest two stile-posts, show there; Queen flag hung Windsor Castle, she home. We played castles houses, tired houses, pretended pack up, went seaside change air brook. Sandy I took shoes stockings bathing-women, bathed Perronet; Richard sat bank "tripper," looking us telescope; elder-stems cracked would not flutes, he made telescopes. And went brook made jam hips haws hedge top field, put acorn cups, took us, children might short rolypolies seaside. Whatever played never disturbed. Birds, cows, men horses ploughing distance, disturb all. We happy summer: boys quite happy, thing vexed thinking Perronet's tax-money. For months months went save it. Once got far twopence half-penny, one day Richard came said, "I must string kite. You might lend penny Perronet's stocking, till I get money own." So I did; next day Sandy came said, "You lent Dick one Perronet's coppers; I am sure Perronet would lend one," said ridiculous leave half-penny itself, spent acid drops. It worried much last, I began dream horrible dreams Perronet go away had not saved his tax-money. And I used wake cry, till pillow wet, I turn it. The boys never seemed mind, boys do not think things; I quite surprised one day I found Sandy alone field Perronet his arms, crying, feeding cake; I found he crying tax-money. I cannot bear see boys cry. I would much rather cry myself, I begged Sandy leave off, I said I quite determined try think something. It certainly remarkable next day day heard flower-show. It school—the village school, Mother could afford send us anywhere else—and schoolmaster rapped his desk said, "Silence, children!" agricultural show flower-show year, old gentleman going give prizes school-children window-plants best arranged wild flowers. There nosegays wreaths, first prize five shillings, second prize half-a-crown, best collection wild flowers names put them. "The English names," said schoolmaster; "and may be—silence, children!—there may collections ferns, grasses, mosses compete, too, gentleman wishes encourage taste natural history." And several village children said, "What is that?" I squeezed Sandy's arm, sitting next me, whispered, "Five shillings!" schoolmaster said, "Silence, children!" I thought I never finished lessons day thinking Perronet's tax-money. July good month wild flowers; May June far better. However, show first week July. I said boys, "Look here: I will collection flowers. I know names, I print. It is good two three people muddling arranging flowers; but; get I want, I shall much obliged. If either make another collection, know ten kinds mosses brook; names own, English. Perhaps they will do. But everything must come Our Field." The boys agreed, good. Richard made box, rather high back. We put sand bottom damped it, Feather Moss, lovely clumps it, I stuck flowers. They came Our Field. I like see grass flowers, pretty grasses, every bunch flowers I put bunch grass different kinds. I got flowers grasses ready first, printed names pieces cardboard stick them, I arranged eye, Sandy handed I called for, Richard busy brook making tray mosses. Sandy knew flowers names quite well I did, course; knew everything lived Our Field; I called, "Ox-eye daisies, cock's-foot grass, labels; meadow-sweet, fox-tail grass, labels; dog-roses, shivering grass, labels;" on, he gave right things, I nothing put colours looked best together next other, make grass look light, pull bits moss show well. And end I put label, "All Our Field." I like done; Richard praised much, cheered up, I thought his mosses looked lovely. The flower-show day hot. I think could hotter anywhere world field show was; hotter tent. We never got all—for pay gate—but let competitors free, though first. When got in, lot grown-up people, hard work getting along among them, getting see stands things on. We kept seeing tickets "1st Prize" "2nd Prize," struggling up; sure dahlias tray, fruit might not eat, vegetables. The vegetables disappointed us often, I got hate them. I do not think I shall ever like big potatoes (before boiled) again, particularly red ones. It makes feel sick heat anxiety think them. We struggled slowly round tent, seen cucumbers, onions, lettuces, long potatoes, round potatoes, everything else, saw old gentleman, spectacles white hair, standing two three ladies. And saw three nosegays jugs, green picked off, flowers tied tightly together would go, saw prettier ones, saw collection, got big label marked "1st Prize," next came Richard's moss-tray, Hair-moss, Pincushion-moss, Scale-mosses, lot others names own, marked "2nd Prize." And I gripped one Sandy's arms Richard seized other, cried, "Perronet paid for!" * * * * * There two-and-sixpence over. We never feast! It picnic tea, Our Field. I thought Sandy Perronet would died cake, none worse. We much frightened first old gentleman invited himself; he would come, he brought lot nuts, he get inside oak, though really small him. I do not think ever anybody kind. If he man, I really truly believe Sandy's fairy godmother. Of course I do not really believe fairies. I young that. And I know Our Field exactly belong us. I wonder belong? Richard says he believes belongs gentleman lives big red house among trees. But he must wrong; see gentleman church every Sunday, never saw Our Field. And I do not believe anybody could field own, never come see it, one end Summer other. MADAM LIBERALITY. "Like little body mighty heart." _King Henry V., Act 2._ PART I. It her real name: given her her brothers sister. People marked qualities character sometimes get distinctive titles, rectify indefiniteness inherit receive baptism. The ruling peculiarity character apt show early life, showed Madam Liberality she little child. Plum-cakes plentiful her home Madam Liberality young, were, "wholesome" kind—plenty bread-stuff, currants raisins respectful distance other. But plums were, she seldom ate them. She picked carefully, put box, hidden her pinafore. When grown-up people children, plum-cake plum-pudding tasted much nicer now, also picked plums. Some us ate once, toil slowly cake pudding, valiantly dispatched plainer portion feast beginning, kept plums sweeten end. Sooner later ate ourselves, Madam Liberality kept her plums people. When vulgar meal over—that commonplace refreshment ordained superintended elders household—Madam Liberality would withdraw corner, she issued notes invitation dolls. They "fancy written" curl papers folded cocked hats. Then began real feast. The dolls came, children them. Madam Liberality toy tea-sets dinner-sets, acorn-cups filled brim, water tasted deliciously, though came ewer night nursery, even filtered. And every doll flat oyster-she will covered round oyster-she will, complete set complete pairs, collected degrees, like old family plate. And upper she will raised, every dish lay plum. It Madam Liberality got her sweetness cake. She her glory head inverted tea-chest; raisins would go round, empty oyster-she will hers, nothing offended her noticed. That her spirit, always. She could "do without" anything, wherewithal hospitable left her. When one's brain stronger mine is, one gets much confused disentangling motives nice points character. I doubted whether Madam Liberality's besetting virtue virtue all. Was unselfishness love approbation, benevolence fussiness, gift sympathy lust power? Or something else? She sickly child, much pain bear, many pleasures forego. Was it, doctors say, "an effort nature," make her live outside herself happy happiness others? Equal doubt may hang conduct her brothers sister towards her. Did love her, find her useful? Was gratitude—as gratitude defined be—"a keen sense favours come"? They certainly got used her services, begging borrowing things her "very own," without fear refusal. But rather took her benevolence granted, thought she "liked lending her things," her way enjoying possessions, may right; next one's soul, one's family perhaps best judge one's temper disposition. And called her Madam Liberality, Madam Liberality she shall remain. It hinted reason scarceness plums plum-cake. Madam Liberality's father dead, her mother poor, several children. It easy matter her find bread family, putting currants raisins question. Though poor, were, however, gentle-folk, had, matter, rich relations. Very rich relations indeed! Madam Liberality's mother's first cousin fifteen thousand year. His servants spend ten thousand. (As he spent himself, comparatively trifling.) The rest money accumulated. Not got together something by. He intention ever spending he spent present. Indeed, lump coal taken here, needless candle blown there, he rather hoped future spend less. His wife Madam Liberality's godmother. She good-hearted woman, took real pleasure kind people, way she thought best them. Sometimes graceful appropriate way, often not. The acceptable act kindness she ever her god-daughter child recovering illness, she asked her visit her seaside. Madam Liberality never seen sea, thought proved better stimulus port wine her doctor ordered easily, her mother got difficulty. When new clothes bought, old ones refurbished, Madam Liberality, rule, went wall. Not her mother ever guilty favouritism, occasions afforded opportunity displaying generosity towards her younger sister. But time otherwise; whatever could spared towards "summer things" two little girls spent upon Madam Liberality's outfit seaside. There new dress, jacket "as good new," cut "mother's" cloth cloak made up, best binding buttons shop, village tailor. And he bribed, secret visit, much coaxing little girls, make real pockets instead braided shams. The _second best_ frock compounded two hitherto _very bests_—Madam Liberality's own, eked "Darling's" fashionable fullness, cape match. There sense solid property derived able take glance stock well-mended under-garments, half generally wash. Besides, added to, stockings darned, one pair legs would show, short petticoat mark. Then bonnet newly turned trimmed, pair half new boots, surely boots least half new (as village cobbler described his bill) "souled healed"? Poor little Madam Liberality! When she saw things covered her bed abundance, seemed her outfit princess. And yet her godmother asked Podmore, lady's-maid, "How child clothes?" Podmore unhesitatingly replied, "She've nothing fit seen, madam," shows differently things appear different circumstances. Podmore good friend Madam Liberality. She open-handed spirit one acquires quite naturally house everything goes large scale, somebody else's expense. Now Madam Liberality's godmother, largeness her possessions, obliged leave care others, matters food, dress, gardens, stables, etc. So, like many people similar case, she amused herself exercised her economical instincts troublesome little thriftinesses, making cheap presents, dear bargains, forth. She nature managing woman; grand people, butler, housekeeper, head-gardener, lady's-maid divided her household duties among them, nothing left her clever about, except little matters joining fag-ends bronze sealing-wax sticks lay silver inkstand malachite writing-table, good-natured cheapest rate her friends could benefited. Madam Liberality's best neckerchief pretty new, would pretty well clean still washerwoman used rather hot iron it, blue check pattern somewhat faded. And yet felt smart Madam Liberality drove carrier's cart meet coach outset her journey. But she sat rich blue leather her godmother's coach drove esplanade, like looking fairy jewels daylight turn faded leaves. "Is best neckerchief, child?" said old lady. "Yes, madam," blushed Madam Liberality, So got home her godmother went her odds-and-ends drawer. Podmore never interfered drawer. She content despotic among dresses, left old lady faddle her heart's content bits old lace ribbon she herself would condescended wear. The old lady fumbled over. There good many half-yards ribbon large patterns, nothing really fit Madam Liberality's little neck small Indian scarf many-coloured silk. It old, Podmore would never allowed her mistress drive esplanade anything small youthful-looking; colours quite bright, doubt Madam Liberality might provided cheaper neck-ribbon. So old lady shut drawer, toddled corridor led Podmore's room. She good general idea Podmore's perquisites large, perquisites seem condition valuable servants large establishments, anything could recovered already passed Podmore's room must kind economy. So she resolved Podmore "find something" Madam Liberality's neck. "I never noticed it, madam, till I brought shawl carriage," said Podmore. "If I seen before, young lady should not come so. I will see it, madam." "Thank you, Podmore." "Can spare go town afternoon, madam?" added lady's-maid. "I want things Huckaback Woolsey's." Huckaback Woolsey linendrapers Madam Liberality's godmother "had account." It one things large scale details she control. "You will back time dress me?" "Oh dear, yes, madam." And settled old lady's shawl her shoulders, drawn her cap-lappets, Podmore returned her work. It work kindness. The old lady might deal shabbily her faded ribbons her relations, butler, housekeeper, lady's-maid best keep credit family. It well known Madam Liberality cousin, Podmore resolved she proper frock go dessert in. So she busy making little slip yards blue silk one old lady's dresses, she betook herself draper's get spotted muslin cover ribbons trim with. And whilst Madam Liberality's godmother still feeling twinges Indian scarf, Podmore ordered pink neckerchief shot white, pink white fringes, included parcel. But way alone Podmore good friend Madam Liberality. She took her walking, let her play beach, even bring home dirty weeds shells. Indeed, Podmore herself collecting cowries pill-box her little nephews. When Mrs. Podmore met acquaintances beach, Madam Liberality played alone, her happiest moments. She played amongst rotting, weed-grown stakes old pier, "fancied" rooms among them—suites rooms she would lodge her brothers sister came visit her, where—with cockle-shells teacups, lava vegetables, fucus-pods fish—they find much enchanted Beauty palace Beast. Again she "fancied" Darling her shore-palace, delights marred growls she herself would utter time time behind stakes, character sea-beast, enhance moment she would rush throw her arms round Darling's neck reveal herself Madam Liberality. "Darling" pet name Madam Liberality's sister—her sister, she lavished intensest affection heart always large one proportion her little body. It seemed strange play game fancies without Darling, Madam Liberality could hardly realize it. She might preparing herself larger treat usual others; incredible one would come all, Darling would never see palace beach, state-rooms, limpets, seaweed, salt-water soup, real fish (a small dab discarded herring-net) Madam Liberality got her. Her mind filled day-dreams Darling's coming, she would display her wonders seashore, would reflect almost much credit upon her she invented razor-shells crabs. She thought much she began quite expect it. Was natural her godmother see she must lonely, ask Darling come her? Perhaps old lady already done so, visit surprise. Madam Liberality could quite imagine nice thing like herself, she hoped strongly she almost came believe it. Every day she waited hopefully, first post, time coach came in, hour she herself arrived; coach brought Darling, post brought letter say she coming, Madam Liberality's hopes disappointed. Madam Liberality accustomed disappointment. From her earliest years family joke poor Madam Liberality always ill-luck's way. It true she constantly planning; one builds castles, one must expect loose stones one's ears then. But, besides this, her little hopes constantly frustrated fate. If pigs hens got garden, Madam Liberality's bed sure laid waste one came rescue. When picnic tea-party store, Madam Liberality catch cold, hinder her going, she pretty sure quinsy fatigue wet feet afterwards. When she treat she paid pleasurable excitement headache, she ate sweet things gave her toothache. But her luck less people's, her courage good spirits common. She could think pleasure treat she forgotten headache. One side her little face would look fairly cheerful obliterated flannel bag hot camomile flowers, whole redolent every horrible domestic remedy toothache, oil cloves creosote baked onion ear. No sufferings abated her energy fresh exploits, quenched hope cold, damp, fatigue would hurt her "this time." In intervals wringing hot flannels her quinsy, she would amuse herself devising desert island expedition larger possibly damper scale hitherto, time she again. It old simile, Madam Liberality really like cork rising top wave ill-luck swallowed her hopes. Her little white face undaunted spirit bobbed mischance malady ready hopeful ever. Though her day-dream Darling shore palace constantly disappointed, hinder her indulging new hopes fancies another place she went Podmore; place filled wonders different kind treasures palace shore. It called Bazaar. It would long business say it. But amongst things foreign cage-birds, musical-boxes, camp-stools, baskets, polished pebbles, paper patterns, little ladies' children's millinery, good deal mock jewellery, bad soaps scents, good children's toys. It Madam Liberality's godmother first took her bazaar. A titled lady her acquaintance heard wire flower-baskets certain shape could bought bazaar cheaper (by two-pence-halfpenny each) London; writing her friend ascertain truth statement, she wrote authorize her purchase three her behalf. So Madam Liberality's godmother ordered blue carriage pair, drove her little cousin bazaar. And came out, followed bearded man, bowing low, carrying wire baskets, Madam Liberality's godmother stopped near toy-stall button her glove. And she buttoned (which took long time, her hands stout, Podmore generally hook), she said Madam Liberality, "Now, child, I want tell good whilst me, Podmore gives good report you, I bring go home, buy present." Madam Liberality's heart danced delight. She wished her godmother would stand toy-stall hour, she might see she hoped present would be. But footman tucked carriage, bearded man bowed back bazaar, drove home. Then Madam Liberality's godmother directed butler dispatch wire baskets her ladyship, he coach. And her ladyship's butler paid carriage, tipped man brought parcel coach-office, charged items his account. And her ladyship wrote long letter thanks Madam Liberality's godmother her kindness saving her unnecessary expense. The old lady go bazaar time, Madam Liberality went Podmore. She looked toys wondered might one day her own. The white china tea-service green rim, big enough make real tea in, good hoped for, tin tea-sets lids would come off, wooden ones stuck on; manner toys would invaluable kinds nursery games fancies. They helped "fancy" Madam Liberality even then. She used stand toy-stall, fancy she rich her godmother, going give Christmas-boxes her brothers sister, her amusement choose, though she could buy them. Out came deep mortification. She playing fancy one afternoon, rather confused herself changing her mind toys, she went her final list undertone, get clearly her head. The shopman serving lady, Madam Liberality thought he could hear her she murmured, "The china tea-set, box beasts, doll's furniture Darling," etc., etc. But shopman's hearing acute, he darted forward, crying, "The china tea-set, say, miss?" The blood rushed poor Madam Liberality's face till seemed choke her, lady, shopman serving, said kindly, "I think little girl said box beasts." Madam Liberality hoped dream, pinched herself, she found not. Her mother often said her, "When cannot think say, tell truth." It easy rule, Madam Liberality went it. "I do not want anything, thank you," said she; "at least, I mean I money buy anything with: I counting things I like get I had." And then, floor bazaar would _not_ open swallow her up, she ran away, her red face her empty pocket, shelter herself Podmore mock-jewellery stall, she go bazaar more. Once disappointment store Madam Liberality. The end her visit came, her godmother's promise seemed forgotten. But night her departure, old lady came her room said, "I could not take to-day, child, I did not forget promise. Podmore says you have good, I have brought present. A _useful_ one, I hope," added old lady, tone she congratulating herself upon her good sense. "And tell Catherine—that is mother, child—with love, always dressed evening. I like see children come dessert, good manners—which I must say have; besides, keeps nurses work." And she drew paper little frock pink _mousseline-de-laine_, prettily tacked together young woman millinery-stall, cheap gay appearance. Down came Madam Liberality's visions connection toy-stall: she consoled herself night picturing Darling's delight she gave her (as she meant give her) pink dress. She another source comfort anticipation—_the scallop-shells_. But requires explained. The greatest prize Madam Liberality gained her wanderings seashore complete scallop-she will. When washed double she will clean pretty china muffin-dish round top; her ambition get four more, thus service doll's feasts far surpass oyster-shells. She talking Podmore one day picking cowries together, Podmore cried, "Why, little girl would get them, miss, I will bound!" She bare-footed little girl, sold pebbles seaweed, salt water sponging with, she undertaken get scallop-shells, run pick seaweed newly landed net Madam Liberality could say "Thank you." She heard shells, however, day she went away, butler met her she came indoors, told her little girl waiting. And till Madam Liberality saw scallop-shells lying clean pink cotton handkerchief she remembered she money pay them. Here another occasion painful truthtelling! But make humiliating confession butler seemed almost beyond even Madam Liberality's moral courage. He went back his pantry, however, she pulled her pretty pink neckerchief said, "I _very_ sorry, little girl, I have got money own; would like instead—" And little girl seemed quite pleased her bargain, ran hastily off, afraid young lady would change her mind. And Madam Liberality got her scallop-shells. * * * * * It may seem strange Madam Liberality ever accused meanness, yet her eldest brother shake his head her say, "You are meanest _generoustest_ person I ever knew!" And Madam Liberality wept accusation, although her brother young form either his words his opinions correctly. But touch truth made Madam Liberality cry. To end lives Tom she alike yet different matter. Madam Liberality saved, pinched, planned, gave away, Tom gave away without pinching saving. This sounds much handsomer, poor Tom's misfortune he always believed so; though he gave away belong him, fell back supply his pretty numerous wants upon people, forgetting Madam Liberality. Painful experience convinced Madam Liberality end his way wrong one, she her doubts many times her life whether something unhandsome her decided talent economy. Not economy always pleasant her. When people poor position life, keep debt stinting many occasions stinting painful liberal spirit. And requires sterner virtue good-nature hold fast truth nobler shabby honest things handsomely debt. But long Tom bill even bull's-eyes Gibraltar Rock, Madam Liberality pinching plotting, saving bits coloured paper ends ribbon, thriftiness seemed justify Tom's view her character. The object savings twofold: birthday presents Christmas-boxes. They chief cares triumphs Madam Liberality's childhood. It next birthday approaching Christmas view she saved her pence instead spending them, she seldom money she chiefly relied her ingenuity. Year year became difficult make anything would "do boy;" easy please Darling, "Mother's" unabated appreciation pincushions, needle-books made old cards, satisfactory. To break mystery always pleased Madam Liberality shroud her small preparations, give her dire offence. As rule, others respected caprice, would even feign little surprise felt, upon occasion. But her preparations she given umbrage one boys, her retreat soon invaded cries of—"Ah! I see you, making birthday presents nothing quarter yard ribbon!" Or—"There are! At again, two old visiting cards ha'porth flannel!" And Darling's tenderest kisses could appease Madam Liberality's wrath dry her tears. She never made grander project Christmas, greater difficulty carrying out, winter followed her visit seaside. It house her cousin she first heard Christmas-trees, surprise others Christmas-tree she quite resolved. But time drew near, poor Madam Liberality almost despair her presents, doubly provoking, nice little fir-tree promised her. There blinking fact "Mother" provided pincushions repletion. And made needles rusty, stuffed damp pig-meal, pigs pincushions fattened Christmas. Madam Liberality sat her little pale face her hand her slate her, making her calculations. She wondered emery-powder cost. Supposing cheap, she could get quarter pound "next nothing," useful present might made "Mother" shape emery pincushion, counteract evil effects pig-meal ones! It would novelty even Darling, especially made glueing tiny bag emery mouth "boiled fowl cowry." Madam Liberality seen pincushion Podmore's work-basket. She she will kind, village carpenter would always let her put stick his glue-pot she went shop. But then, emery penny pound, Madam Liberality farthing buy quarter pound with. As she thought her brow contracted, partly vexation, partly jumping pain big tooth, which, either much illness many medicines, both, wreck tooth be. But toothache grew worse, new hope dawned upon Madam Liberality. Perhaps one her troubles would mend other! Being tender-hearted children's sufferings, her mother's custom bribe rather coerce teeth taken out. The fixed scale reward sixpence tooth without fangs, shilling one them. If pain evidence, tooth certainly fangs. But one tooth taken one avoid it, Madam Liberality bore bad nights painful days till could endured longer; then, she knew distressed her mother present, she went alone doctor's house ask take her tooth. The doctor kind old man, he his best, say anything his antique instruments, number times he tied pocket-handkerchief round awful-looking claw, put Madam Liberality's mouth without effect. At last he said he got tooth out, he wrapped paper, gave Madam Liberality, who, thought her head he extracted socket, relieved get away. As she ran home she began plan lay her shilling best, she nearly she opened bit paper look her enemy, fangs! "I am _sure_ sixpenny one," she sobbed; "I believe he left in." It involved loss half funds she reckoned upon. Perhaps dreadful pain would go even Christmas Day. Her first thought carry her tears her mother; her second that, she could brave enough fangs taken out, she might spare mother distress till over, she would certainly like her sufferings known sympathized with. She knew well courage come waiting, making desperate rally stout-heartedness, she ran back doctor. He gone out, his assistant in. He looked Madam Liberality's mouth, said fangs certainly left would much better out. "Would hurt _very_ much?" asked Madam Liberality, trembling. The assistant blinked question "hurting." "I think I could it," said he, "if could sit still. Not jumping about." "I sit still," said Madam Liberality. "The boy shall hold head," said assistant. But Madam Liberality rebelled; she could screw her sensitive nerves endure pain, coerced "the boy." "I give word honour I sit still," said she, plaintive earnestness. And assistant (who remembered boy gig) said, "Very well, miss." We need dwell upon next seconds. The assistant kept his word, Madam Liberality kept hers. She sat still, went sitting still operation till assistant became alarmed, revived her pouring choking stuff her throat. After she staggered her feet put her hand thanked him. He strong, rough, good-natured young man, little Madam Liberality's pale face politeness touched him. "You are bravest little lady I ever knew," he said kindly; "and keep word like queen. There is stuff put place, there is sixpence, miss, you will take it, buy lollipops with. You will able eat now." After he gave her old pill-box carry fragments her tooth in, labelled "three taken bed-time." Madam Liberality staggered home, giddy, happy. Moralists say great deal pain treading closely heels pleasure life, always wise grateful enough speak pleasure springs pain. And yet bliss comes pain ceased, whose rapture rivals even high happiness unbroken health; keen relish small pleasures hardly earned, full measure afford anything want sometimes lacking. Relief certainly one delicious sensations poor humanity, enjoy! Madam Liberality enjoyed full, she happiness yet her cup, I fear praise pleasant her, assistant praised her, undeservedly, she knew praise store dearest source approbation—from her mother. Ah! pleased she would be! And would Darling, always cried Madam Liberality great pain. And beginning pleasures. The sixpence would amply provide "goodies" Christmas-tree, much might done forthcoming shilling. And her conduct present occasion would support request ends candles drawing-room candle-sticks, profit would heroine? When her mother gave her two shillings instead one, Madam Liberality felt honour bound say she already rewarded sixpence; her mother said, "You quite deserved it, I am sure," she found herself possession less half-a-crown. And sad relate misfortune overtook Madam Liberality. All next day she longed go village buy sweetmeats, snowed rained, bitterly cold, she could not. Just dusk weather slightly cleared up, she picked her way melting snow shop. Her purchases satisfactory. How boys would enjoy them! Madam Liberality enjoyed already, though her face still sore, pain spread her throat, though her ideas seemed unusually brilliant, her body pleasantly languid, which, added peculiar chill trembling knees—generally forewarned her coming quinsy. But warnings thrown away upon Madam Liberality's obdurate hopefulness. Just she could think nothing coming Christmas-tree. She hid sweetmeats, put her hand her pocket two shillings, exact outlay which, neighbouring town, means carrier, she already arranged. But—the two shillings gone! How she lost Madam Liberality idea. She trudged dirty snow shop, counter examined, old Goody looked flour scales big chinks stone floor. But shillings there, Madam Liberality kept her eyes pavement she ran home, little result. Moreover, nearly dark. It snowed heavily night, Madam Liberality slept little pain anxiety; deter her going first daylight morning rake among snow near door, although her throat sore beyond concealment, her jaws stiff, pleasant languor quick-wittedness given way restless fever. Her conscience prick her little anxiety she bringing upon her mother (her sufferings she never forecast); she could give her Christmas-tree without struggle, she hoped familiar remedies drive back threatened illness. Meanwhile, shillings found eleven of the clock would late send town shop carrier. But found, old hooded cart rumbled away without them. It Christmas Eve. The boys bustling holly. Darling perched high chair kitchen, picking raisins honourable manner, without eating one, Madam Liberality ought happiest all. Even she dried her tears, made best her ill-luck. The sweetmeats good; yet her power please others, though sacrifice she shrunk. She could divide her scallop-shells among them. It economy—economy resources—which made her hesitate. Separated—they would please boys once, lost. Kept together her possession—they would constant source triumph herself, treats her brothers sister. Meanwhile, she would gargle her throat salt water. As she crept up-stairs purpose, she met her mother. Madam Liberality looked looking-glass lately, she understand her mother's exclamation distress met. Her face perfectly white, except dark marks lay her eyes, her small lips formed rigid line pain. It impossible hold longer, Madam Liberality broke poured forth her woes. "I will put feet hot water, anything like, mother dear," said she, "if you will let try tree, keep secret others. I want surprise them." "If you will go room, darling, I tell you, I will keep secret, help tree," said her mother. "Do not cry, child, do not cry; it is bad throat. I think I find beads make necklace Darling, three pencils boys, paper cut drawing-books them." A little hope went long way Madam Liberality, she began take heart. At time she felt her illness keenly need concealing it. She sat fire inhaled steam old teapot, threaded beads, hoped she would allowed go church next day, preside her Christmas-tree afterwards. In afternoon her throat grew rapidly worse. She begged—almost impatiently—that Darling would leave Christmas preparations sit her, talking bad her, she secret preparations make her account, her mother supported her wish left alone. But grew dusk, drawing-books finished, Madam Liberality felt lonely. She put shawl round her head, went window. There much seen. The fields deeply buried snow, looked like great white feather beds, shaken unequally hedges. The road covered deeply she could hardly traced it, she known was. How dark old church tower looked amid much whiteness! And snow-flakes fell like sugar-plums among black trees. One could almost hear keen wind rustling bending sedges pond, ice looked quite "safe" now. Madam Liberality hoped she would able get fine frost over. She knew old plank would make admirable sledge, she plan grandest winter games ready her head. It called Arctic Discovery—and she chief discoverer. As she fancied herself—starving scientific, chilled bone, yet undaunted—discovering north-west passage upper end goose pond, clock struck three old church tower. Madam Liberality heard pang. At three of the clock—if he her shillings—she would expecting return carrier, presents her Christmas-tree. Even she thought it, old hooded waggon came lumbering among snow-drifts lane. There bunch mistletoe head, old carrier went horse, dog went carrier. And three knees snow, three noses down, much say, "Such life; must struggle on." Poor Madam Liberality! The sight waggon mistletoe overwhelmed her. It made matters worse see waggon come towards house. She rather wondered carrier bringing; whatever was, toys. She went back her seat fire, cried bitterly; and, she cried, ball her throat seemed grow larger, till she could hardly breathe. She glad door opened, her mother's kind face looked in. "Is Darling here?" she asked. "No, mother," said Madam Liberality huskily. "Then may bring in," said her mother one outside, servant appeared, carrying wooden box, she put Madam Liberality, withdrew. "Now do not speak," said her mother, "it bad you, eyes asked fifty questions already, child. Where box come from? The carrier brought it. Who for? It is you. Who sent it? That I do not know. What inside? I thought would like first see. My idea perhaps godmother sent Christmas-box, I thought might things would help Christmas-tree, I told one it." To end her life Madam Liberality never forgot Christmas-box. It come her godmother, name giver she never knew. The first thing card, written—"A Christmas-box unknown friend;" second thing set china tea-things green rim; third thing box doll's furniture. "Oh, Mother!" cried Madam Liberality, "they are things I counting bazaar, shopman heard me." "Did anybody else hear you?" asked her mother. "There lady, said, 'I think little girl said box beasts.' And, oh! Mother, Mother! _is_ box beasts! They are common beasts, know—not wooden ones, painted; they are rough, something like hair. And feel old elephant's ears, they are quite leathery, lion real long hair his mane tip his tail. They thorough beasts. Oh, boys like them! Tom shall darling brown bear. I think he best beast all; his mouth little open, know, see his tongue, it is red. And, Mother! sheep curly! And oh, dog! real hair. I think I _must_ keep dog. And I shall make paper collar, print 'Faithful' it, let always stand drawers bed, he will Darling's watch-dog." Happiness sometimes wholesome, cure quinsy hand. Darling cried night big pillow brought out, Madam Liberality always slept her quinsies, keep her choking. She know consolatory Christmas-box cupboard. On Christmas Day Madam Liberality speechless. The quinsy progressed rapidly. "It generally breaks day I write slate," Madam Liberality wrote, looking her mother piteous eyes. She conscious she greatly blame she suffering, anxious "behave well it" atonement. She begged—on her slate—that one would stay away church her account, her mother would leave her. "And others gone," said Mother, "since will not let Christmas-tree put off, I propose up, I dress orders, whilst others out, moved little book-room, ready to-night." Madam Liberality nodded like china Mandarin. "But sad pain, I fear?" said her mother, "One cannot everything," wrote Madam Liberality her slate. Many illnesses made her philosophical little woman; and, indeed, quinsy broke she ease, combination good things would one could reasonably expect, even Christmas. Every beast labelled, hung her orders. The box furniture addressed herself Darling, joint possession, sweetmeats tied bags muslin. The tree looked charming. The angel top seemed proud it. "I will leave tea-things up-stairs," said Mother. But Madam Liberality shook her head vigorously. She making her mind, she sat steaming old teapot; she wrote her slate, "Put white cloth round tub, put tea-things like tea-party, put ticket slop-basin—_For Darling. With very_, VERY _Best Love_. Make last 'very' big." Madam Liberality's mother nodded, she printing ticket; much large ticket, however, go green white slop-basin. When done she hung tree, angel. The inscription was—_From Madam Liberality_. When supper over, she came Madam Liberality's room, said, "Now, dear, like change mind put tree till better, I say nothing it." But Madam Liberality shook her head vehemently before, her mother smiled went away. Madam Liberality strained her ears. The book-room door opened—she knew voice handle—there rush noise, died away room. The tears broke Madam Liberality's cheeks. It hard now. Then patter stairs, flying steps along landing, Madam Liberality's door opened Darling. She dressed pink dress, her cheeks pinker still, her eyes full tears. And she threw herself Madam Liberality's feet, crying, "Oh _how_ good, _very_ good are!" At moment roar came below, Madam Liberality wrote, "What it?" dropped slate clutch arms her chair, pain becoming almost intolerable. Before Darling could open door her mother came in, Darling repeated question, "What it?" But moment reply came below, Tom's loudest tones. It rang house, bedroom. "Three cheers Madam Liberality! Hip, hip, hooray!" The extremes pleasure pain seemed meet Madam Liberality's little head. But overwhelming gratification got upper hand, and, forgetting even her quinsy, she tried speak, brief struggle she said, tolerable distinctness, "Tell Tom I much obliged him." But tell Tom quinsy broken, he gave three cheers more. PART II. Madam Liberality grew much sort person she child. She always termed old-fashioned, older she grew better her old-fashionedness became her, last her friends would say her, "Ah, wore well do, dear! You have hardly changed since remember short petticoats." So far she change change better. (It hoped improve little get older!) She still liberal economical. She still planned hoped indefatigably. She still tender-hearted sense Gray speaks, "To his sufferings, men Condemned alike groan, The tender another's pain, The unfeeling his own." She still good deal ill-health ill-luck, good deal pleasure spite both. She still happy happiness others, pleased praise. But she less headstrong opinionated her plans, less fretful failed. It possible, one cut one's wisdom-teeth, cure one's self even good deal vanity, learn play second fiddle gracefully; Madam Liberality resist lessons life. GOD teaches us wisdom divers ways. Why He suffers people many troubles little call pleasure world cannot world know. The heaviest blows often fall weakest shoulders, endure bear another things GOD knows better we. I pretend decide whether grown-up people's troubles harder bear children's troubles, graver kind. It bitter boys melt nose one's dearest doll stove, living pets kind eyes friendly paws grow aged die; death friends serious lasting sorrow, real. Madam Liberality she would fewer tears she grew she done before, she heart-aches heal. The thing cure her managing good people Darling's marriage. If ever Madam Liberality felt proud self-sacrifice success, this. But Darling fairly gone, "Faithful"—very grey dust years—kept watch one sister "the girls' room," he might seen Madam Liberality's nightly tears his eyes made anything sensitive yellow paint. Desolate she was, Madam Liberality would hugged her grief she could her old consolation, happy happiness another. Darling never said she happy. It she left out, she put long letters she sent India cut Madam Liberality heart. Darling's husband read her letters, he like home ones tender—as Darling's mother sister pitied her. And he read Darling's letters went away mail. From came sisters' letters commonplace surface. And though Madam Liberality cried Darling wrote, "Have swallows built summer-house year? Have put old doll's chest drawers back place since room papered? What colour paper?"—the Major said stuff like hardly worth postage England. And Madam Liberality wrote, "The clump daffodils old bed enormous spring. I touched since left. I made Mother's birthday wreath flowers bed mine. Jemima broke slop-basin green white tea-set to-day. It last piece left. I trying forgive her,"—the Major made harsher remark than, "A storm slop-basin! Your sister brilliant letter-writer, certainly." The source another heart-ache Madam Liberality poor Tom. He liberal hospitable ever his way. He invited his friends stay his mother, Tom gone, Madam Liberality her mother lived without meat get housekeeping book straight again. Their great difficulty matter uncertain nature Tom's requirements. And he write money he always wrote urgent need refusing art "doing without" his wants could supplied. But Tom kindly heart; he sent his sister gold locket, wrote box, "For best generous sisters." Madam Liberality liked praise, she dearly liked praise Tom; occasion failed soothe her. She said curtly, "I suppose it is paid for. If cannot afford much, afford live expense, knavery forbearance tradesmen." With she threw locket box odds ends, turned key temper. Years passed, Madam Liberality alone. Her mother dead, Tom—poor Tom!—had found drowned. Darling still India, two living boys colonies, farming. It seemed aggravation calamity Tom's death he died, he lived, debt. But, regards Madam Liberality, unmixed evil. It one bitterest pangs survive love death opportunity passed kind them, though love ever. By earthly effort could Madam Liberality's mother pleased, little pleased heretofore? But poor Tom still possible plan, economize, liberal—and means pay his debts, save fair name he reckless everything else he possessed. Madam Liberality many hard struggle get Tom birthday present, she never pinched planned saved his behalf she now. There limit, however, strictest economies. It would taken longer time finish her labour love "the boys." They good, kind fellows, earn daily bread larks fall ready cooked mouth, knew realities life poor Tom ever learned. They prosperous now, often sent pounds Madam Liberality "to buy present with." "And none old 'Liberality' tricks, mind!" George wrote one occasion. "Fit thoroughly latest fashions, us credit!" But went Tom's tailor. She felt hardly justified diverting George's money his purpose; she never told boys Tom's debts. There something her old love things without help this, her special love Tom. It boys alone help came her. Madam Liberality's godmother died, left her fifty pounds. In one lump she got enough finish her work. The acknowledgments last payments came Tom's birthday. More courteous grown tradesmen's letters, Madam Liberality felt foolish pleasure seeing respectfully spoke "Your lamented brother, Madam!" The jeweller's bill last; Madam Liberality tied bundle, she got Tom's locket put bit his hair it, tied round her throat, sobbing she so, "Oh, Tom, _could_ lived happy small way! Your debts paid now, poor boy. I wonder know. Oh, Tom, Tom!" It her greatest triumph—to saved Tom's fair name place he lived foolishly died sadly. But triumphs childhood cast fewer shadows. There one say, "Three cheers Madam Liberality!" * * * * * It cold winter, Madam Liberality Jemima, maid-of-all-work, warmer several previous winters, kept better fires. Time heals sorrows spite us, Madam Liberality cheerful little body now, busy ever her Christmas-boxes. Those her nephews nieces already despatched. "The boys" married; Madam Liberality godmother several children she never seen; Benjamin his aunt's heart Darling's child—Tom—though she seen even him. Madam Liberality still thick her plans, chiefly benefit old people well-behaved children village. All Christmas-boxes "surprises," Jemima every secret one concerned her. Madam Liberality even plans her benefit. George talked coming home summer, she began think saving new carpet drawing-room. Then last time she went town she saw curtains artistic pattern, particularly cheap. So much good taste little money rare provincial shops. By she might without something would balance cost curtains. And she another ambition—to provide Jemima black dresses white muslin aprons afternoon wear addition her wages, outward aspect good soul might accordance hitherto her intrinsic excellence. She pondering Jemima burst her cooking apron, followed passage steam Christmas cakes, carrying letter. "It is big one, Miss," said she. "Perhaps it is Christmas-box, Miss." And beaming geniality kitchen warmth, Jemima returned her labours. Madam Liberality made her mind dresses aprons; she opened her letter. It announced death her cousin, her godmother's husband. It announced also that, spite closest search will, he supposed made, could found. Possibly he destroyed it, intending make another. As he died intestate, succession limited heirs male, Madam Liberality eldest child his nearest relative—the old childish feeling dream came her. She pinched herself, however, purpose. There lay letter, second reading Madam Liberality picked thread narrative arrived result—she inherited fifteen thousand year. The first rational idea came her difficulty getting curtains; second chief merit merit more. What good thing cheap one fifteen thousand year? Madam Liberality poked fire extravagantly, sat think. The curtains naturally led her household questions, invaluable person, Jemima. That Jemima's wages doubled, trebled, quadrupled, thing course. What post she fill new circumstances another matter. Remembering Podmore, recalling fatigue dressing herself her pretty numerous illnesses, Madam Liberality felt lady's-maid would comfort thankful for. But she could fancy Jemima capacity, housekeeper, even head housemaid cook. She lived years Jemima herself, she could fit her suitable place servants' hall. However, fifteen thousand year, Madam Liberality could buy, needful, field, build house, put Jemima servant wait upon her. The really important question her new domestics. Sixteen servants heavy responsibility. Madam Liberality high ideas parental duties involved head household. She suffered—more Jemima—over Jemima's lack scruple telling lies good purposes. Now footman young man has, doubt, his peculiar temptations. What check could Madam Liberality keep upon him? Possibly she might—under strong pressure moral responsibility—give good general advice footman; idea butler troubled her. When one lived alone little house many years one gets timid. She put case herself. Say she knew butler habit stealing wine, suspected gardener making good income best wall fruit, would she moral courage firm important personages she caught one school-children picking stealing orchard? And not, would family prayers mockery? Madam Liberality sighed. Poor dear Tom! He his faults certainly; well he would managed butler! This touched weak point her good fortune core. It come late heap luxuries dear "Mother"; late open careers boys; late give mad frolics girlish gaieties light hearts, she Darling had. Ah, could enjoyed together years ago! There remained, however, Madam Liberality's old consolation: one happy happiness others. There nephews nieces provided for, world full poor struggling folk fifteen thousand year would go little way. It was, perhaps, useful many articles lately papers begging letters, impostors, and, evil effects indiscriminate charity elderly ladies; remembrance made Madam Liberality's head ache, troubled her dreams night. It well next day Sunday. Face face greater interests common rich poor, living dead, Madam Liberality grew calmer her new cares prospects. It need brief pause her mother's grave remind her little money us: sight people wholesomely recalled much effect. Near church porch she passed wife retired chandler, dressed fine silks, accustomed eye Madam Liberality's old clothes she bowed her obviously consistent good breeding. The little lady nodded kindly return. With fifteen thousand year one afford _quite_ ease old shawl. The next day Christmas Eve. Madam Liberality caught herself thinking legacy smaller—say fifty pounds year—she would treated herself certain little embellishments old house, she long ambitious. But would absurd buy two three yards rosebud chintz, tire herself making covers two old sofa-cushions, point decided three grandly furnished mansions she would first take her abode. She ordered liberal supper, however, confirmed Jemima her secret opinion big letter brought good news. When, therefore, another letter similar appearance arrived, Jemima snatched waiter burst breathlessly upon Madam Liberality, leaving door open-behind her, though bitterly cold snow fell fast. And Madam Liberality opened letter she learned her cousin's found, (as seems natural) he left his money would associated money kept well together. His heir cousin also, next degree—an old bachelor, already wealthy; he left Madam Liberality five pounds buy mourning ring. It said Madam Liberality used disappointment, minutes passed she quite realized downfall her latest visions. Then old sofa-cushions resumed importance, she flattened fire economical shape, set vigorously work decorate house Christmas evergreens. She finished gone up-stairs wash her hands church clock struck three. It old house, window bedroom went floor, deep window-seat. Madam Liberality sat looked out. She expected linsey-woolsey carrier, make Christmas petticoats, she glad see hooded waggon ploughing way snow. The goose-pond firmly frozen, everything looked looked years ago, except carrier's young son went waggon young dog went him. They passed slowly sight, Madam Liberality sat on. She gazed dreamily old church, trees, pond, thought past; her mother, poor Tom, Darling, she thought till she fancied she heard Darling's voice passage below. She got go Jemima, she she heard footstep stairs, Jemima's tread. It light step man woman. Then door opened, threshold Madam Liberality's room stood little boy dressed black, his little hat pushed back loveliest baby faces set long flaxen hair. The carnation colour his cheeks deepened frost, his bright eyes brighter mingled daring doubt curiosity, he looked leisurely round room said slow, high-pitched, distinct tone, "Where you, Aunt Liberality?" But, lovely he was, Madam Liberality ran past him, another figure doorway now, also black, and, widow's cap; Madam Liberality Darling fell sobbing other's arms. "This better fifteen thousand year," said Madam Liberality. * * * * * It necessary say much more. The Major killed fall horseback, Darling came back live her old home. She little pension, sisters parted again. It would idle dwell Madam Liberality's devotion her nephew, princely manner he accepted her services. That his pleasure object new series plans, presents, surprises, readily understood. The curtains bought, new carpet deferred consequence extravagant outlay mechanical toys. When working brought deeper tint his cheeks, brighter light his eyes, Madam Liberality quite happy; he broke one another, his infatuated aunt believed precocious development manly energies. The longest lived, favourite, toys old set scallop-shells, he never wearied making feasts, Madam Liberality never weary invited. He plums ever sweetened her childhood, sat together two footstools sofa, Tom announced contents dishes his shrillest voice lifted covers, Madam Liberality would say tone apology, "It is odd, Darling, I am sure time life it is disgraceful, I cannot feel old!" We could hardly take leave Madam Liberality pleasanter circumstances. Why ask whether, rest her life, she rich poor, may feel certain she contented? No doubt she many another hope disappointment keep life stagnating. As matter fact she outlived bachelor cousin, he died intestate she must rich all. Perhaps she was. Perhaps she never suffered insufficient food warmth. Perhaps illnesses her later years alleviated skill comforts hitherto she never known. Perhaps Darling she enjoyed sort second spring old age, went every year Continent, grew wonderful flowers greenhouse, sent Tom Eton, provided nephews nieces, built churches mother's memory, never withhold liberal hand helping empty; passed time wealth hour death. Or perhaps cousin took good care bequeath his money money stick to. And Madam Liberality pinched her little presents heretofore, kept herself warm hot bottle she could afford fire, thankful Darling her she ill want anything else. And perhaps Darling she prepared Tom school, (like many another widow's son) he credit. And perhaps quite happy common pot-plants sunny window, kept mother's memory green flowers her grave, passed life small cares small pleasures "Divided households re-unite." Of one thing may quite certain. Rich poor, she always MADAM LIBERALITY.
