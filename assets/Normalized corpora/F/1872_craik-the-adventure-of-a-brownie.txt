 THE ADVENTURES OF A BROWNIE ADVENTURE THE FIRST BROWNIE AND THE COOK THERE little Brownie, lived--where think he lived? coal-cellar. Now coal-cellar may seem curious place choose live in; Brownie curious creature--a fairy, yet one sort fairies fly gossamer wings, dance moonlight, on. He never dances; wings, use would coal-cellar? He sober, stay-at-home, household elf--nothing much look at, even see him, likely do--only little old man, foot high, dressed brown, brown face hands, brown peaked cap, color brown mouse. And, like mouse, he hides corners--especially kitchen corners, comes dark nobody about, sometimes people call Mr. Nobody. I said likely see him. I never did, certainly, never knew body did; still, go Devonshire, would hear many funny stories Brownies general, I may well tell adventures particular Brownie, belonged family there; family he followed house house, faithfully, years years. A good many people heard him--or supposed had--when extraordinary noises house; noises must come mouse rat--or Brownie. But nobody ever seen except children--the three little boys three little girls--who declared he often came play alone, nicest companion world, though he old man--hundreds years old! He full fun mischief, sorts tricks, he never body harm unless deserved it. Brownie supposed live one particular coal, darkest corner cellar, never allowed disturbed. Why he chosen nobody knew, he lived there, nobody knew either, he lived upon. Except that, ever since family could remember, always bowl milk put behind coal-cellar door Brownie's supper. Perhaps he drank it--perhaps he did not: anyhow, bowl always found empty next morning. The old Cook, lived her life family, never forgotten give Brownie his supper; last she died, young cook came her stead, apt forget every thing. She also careless lazy, disliked taking trouble put bowl milk place every night Mr. Nobody. "She did not believe Brownies," she said; "she never seen one, seeing's believing." So she laughed servants, looked grave, put bowl milk place often could, without saying much it. But once, Brownie woke up, his usual hour rising--ten of the clock night, looked round search his supper--which was, fact, his breakfast--he found nothing there. At first he could imagine neglect, went smelling smelling his bowl milk--it always placed corner now--but vain. "This never do," said he; extremely hungry, began running coal-cellar see he could find. His eyes useful dark light--like pussy-cat's; nothing seen--not even potato paring, dry crust, well-gnawed bone, Tiny terrier sometimes brought coal-cellar left floor--nothing, short, heaps coals coal-dust; even Brownie cannot eat that, know. "Cannot stand this; quite impossible!" said Brownie, tightening his belt make his poor little inside feel less empty. He asleep long--about week, I believe, his habit nothing do--that he seemed ready eat his head, his boots, thing. 'What is done? Since nobody brings supper, I must go fetch it.' He spoke quickly, he always thought quickly, made his mind minute. To sure little mind, like his little body; he best he could it, bad sort old fellow, all. In house he never done harm, often good, he frightened away rats, mice, black-beetles. Not crickets--he liked them, old Cook done: she said cheerful creatures, always brought luck house. But young Cook could bear them, used pour boiling water holes, set basins beer little wooden bridges brim, might walk up, tumble in, drowned. So even cricket singing silent house Brownie put his head his coal-cellar door, which, his surprise, he found open. Old Cook used lock every night, young Cook left key, kitchen pantry keys too, dangling lock, thief might got in, wandered house without found out. "Hurrah, here is luck!" cried Brownie, tossing his cap air, bounding right scullery kitchen. It quite empty, good fire burning out--just amusement, remains capital supper spread table--enough half dozen people left still. Would like know was? Devonshire cream, course; part large dish junket, something like curds whey. Lots bread-and-butter cheese, half apple-pudding. Also great jug cider another milk, several half-full glasses, end dirty plates, knives, forks. All scattered table untidy fashion, servants risen supper, without thinking put thing away. Brownie screwed his little old face turned his button nose, gave long whistle. You might believe it, seeing he lived coal-cellar; really he liked tidiness, always played his pranks upon disorderly slovenly folk. [Illustration: He wanted his supper, oh! supper he eat!--Page 11] "Whew!" said he; "here is chance. What supper I will get now!" And he jumped chair thence table, quietly large black cat four white paws, called Muff, she fat soft her fur long, sat dozing front fire, opened one eye went sleep again. She tried get her nose milk-jug, small; junket-dish deep her reach, except one paw. She did not care much bread cheese apple-pudding, well fed besides; so, wandering round table, she jumped again, settled herself sleep hearth. But Brownie notion going sleep. He wanted his supper, oh! supper he eat! first one thing another, trying every thing again. And oh! lot he drank--first milk cider, mixed two together way would disagreed body except Brownie. As was, he obliged slacken his belt several times, last took altogether. But he must extraordinary capacity eating drinking--since, he nearly cleared table, he lively he supper all. Now his jumping little awkward, happened clean white tablecloth: Monday, time get dirty--untidy Cook was. And know Brownie lived coal-cellar, his feet black running coal dust. So wherever he trod, he left impression behind, last whole tablecloth covered black marks. Not he minded this; fact, he took great pains make cloth dirty possible; laughing loudly, "Ho, ho, ho!" leaped hearth, began teasing cat; squeaking like mouse, chirping like cricket, buzzing like fly; altogether disturbing poor Pussy's mind much, she went hid herself farthest corner, left hearth himself, he lay ease till daybreak. Then, hearing slight noise overhead, might servants getting up, he jumped table again--gobbled remaining crumbs his breakfast, scampered his coal-cellar; he hid his big coal, fell asleep day. Well, Cook came downstairs rather earlier usual, she remembered she clear remains supper; lo behold, nothing left clear. Every bit food eaten up--the cheese looked dozen mice nibbling it, nibbled rind; milk cider drunk--and mice do not care milk cider, know. As apple-pudding, vanished altogether; dish licked clean Boxer, yard-dog, his hungriest mood. "And white table-cloth--oh, clean white table-cloth! What done it?" cried she, amazement. For little black footmarks, size baby's foot--only babies do not wear shoes nails them, do not run climb kitchen tables family gone bed. Cook little frightened; her fright changed anger she saw large black cat stretched comfortably hearth. Poor Muff crept little snooze Brownie went away. "You nasty cat! I see now; it is eaten supper; it is clean table-cloth dirty paws." They white paws, clean possible; Cook never thought that, she fact cats do not usually drink cider eat apple-pudding. "I will teach come stealing food way; take that--and that--and that!" Cook got hold broom beat poor Pussy till creature ran mewing away. She could not speak, know--unfortunate cat! tell people Brownie done all. Next night Cook thought she would make safe sure; so, instead letting cat sleep fire, she shut her chilly coal-cellar, locked door, put key her pocket, went bed--leaving supper before. When Brownie woke looked his hole, was, usual, supper him, cellar close shut. He peered about, try find cranny door creep at, none. And he felt hungry he could almost eaten cat, kept walking fro melancholy manner--only she alive, he could not well eat her alive: besides, he knew she old, idea she might tough; he merely said, politely, "How do, Mrs. Pussy?" she answered nothing--of course. Something must done, luckily Brownies things nobody else do. So he thought he would change mouse, gnaw hole door. But he suddenly remembered cat, who, though he decided eat her, might take opportunity eating him. So he thought advisable wait till she fast asleep, happen good while. At length, quite tired walking about, Pussy turned round her tail six times, curled corner, fell fast asleep. Immediately Brownie changed smallest mouse possible; and, taking care make least noise, gnawed hole door, squeezed through, immediately turning his proper shape again, fear accidents. The kitchen fire last glimmer; showed better supper even last night, Cook friends her--a brother two cousins--and exceedingly merry. The food left behind enough three Brownies least, one managed eat up. Only once, trying cut great slice beef, he let carving-knife fork fall clatter, Tiny terrier, tied foot stairs, began bark furiously. However, he brought her her puppy, left basket corner kitchen, succeeded quieting her. After he enjoyed amazingly, made marks ever white table-cloth; he began jumping like pea trencher, order make his particularly large supper agree him. Then, absence cat, he teased puppy hour two, till hearing clock strike five, he thought well turn mouse again, creep back cautiously his cellar. He time, Muff opened one eye, going pounce upon him, he changed back Brownie. She startled she bounded away, her tail growing twice natural size, her eyes gleaming like round green globes. But Brownie said, "Ha, ha, ho!" walked deliberately his hole. When Cook came downstairs saw thing happened again--that supper eaten, table-cloth blacker ever extraordinary footmarks, she greatly puzzled. Who could done all? Not cat, came mewing coal-cellar minute she unlocked door. Possibly rat--but would rat come within reach Tiny? "It must Tiny herself, her puppy," came rolling basket Cook's feet. "You little wretch! You mother greatest nuisance imaginable. I will punish you!" And, quite forgetting Tiny safely tied night, her poor little puppy fat helpless could scarcely stand legs, say nothing jumping chairs tables, she gave thrashing ran howling together kitchen door, kind little kitchen-maid took her arms. "You ought beaten Brownie, could catch him," said she, whisper. "He again, you will see, he cannot bear untidy kitchen. You would better poor old Cook did, clear supper things away, put odds ends safe larder; also," she added, mysteriously, "if I you, I would put bowl milk behind coal-cellar door." "Nonsense!" answered young Cook, flounced away. But afterward she thought better it, she advised, grumbling time, it. Next morning milk gone! Perhaps Brownie drunk up, anyhow nobody could say he had not. As supper, Cook safely laid shelves larder, nobody touched it. And table-cloth, wrapped tidily put dresser drawer, came clean ever, single black footmark upon it. No mischief done, cat dog escaped beating, Brownie played tricks body--till next time. ADVENTURE THE SECOND BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE THE "next time" quick coming, wonderful, considering Brownie house. Otherwise house like houses, family like families. The children also: sometimes good, sometimes naughty, like children; but, whole, deserved pleasure Brownie play them, declared he did--many many time. A favorite play-place orchard, grew biggest cherry-tree ever saw. They called "castle," rose ten feet ground one thick stem, branched circle boughs, flat place middle, two three children could sit once. There often sit, turn turn, one time--sometimes book, reading; biggest boy made sort rope-ladder could climb down--which winter, enjoyed "castle" much. But one day spring found ladder cut away! The Gardener done it, saying injured tree, coming blossom. Now Gardener rather gruff man, growling voice. He mean unkind, he disliked children; he said bothered him. But complained mother ladder, she agreed Gardener tree must injured, bore biggest cherries neighborhood--so big old saying "taking two bites cherry," came really true. "Wait till cherries ripe," said she; little people waited, watched leafing blossoming--such sheets blossom, white snow!--till fruit began show, grew large red every bough. At last one morning mother said, "Children, like help gather cherries to-day?" "Hurrah!" cried, "and day soon; saw flock starlings next field--and do not clear tree, will." "Very well; clear it, then. Only mind fill basket quite full, preserving. What may eat, like." "Thank you, thank you!" children eager off; mother stopped till she could get Gardener his ladder. "For he must climb tree, you; must exactly he tells you; he stop time see do not come harm." This slight cloud children's happiness, begged hard go alone. "Please, might we? We good!" [Illustration: When Gardener steadying his ladder trunk cherry-tree] The mother shook her head. All goodness world would help tumbled tree, ate sick cherries. "You would safe, I unhappy!" To make mother "unhappy" worst rebuke possible children; choked disappointment, followed Gardener he walked ahead, carrying his ladder his shoulder. He looked cross, he like children's company all. They pretty good, whole, though chattered good deal; Gardener said word way orchard. When reached it, he told "keep his way worrit him," politely promised, saying among enjoy cherry-gathering all. But children make best things, try good can, sometimes fun unawares. When Gardener steadying his ladder trunk cherry-tree, suddenly heard barking dog, fierce dog, too. First seemed close beside them, flower-garden, fowl-yard. Gardener dropped ladder his hands. "It is Boxer! He got loose again! He running chickens, dragging his broken chain borders. And he fierce, delighted get free. He will bite body ties up, except me." "Had not better go see him?" Gardener thought eldest boy spoke, turned round angrily; little fellow never opened his lips. Here heard still louder bark, quite different part garden. "There he is--I am sure it! jumping bedding-out plants, breaking cucumber frames. Abominable beast!--just let catch him!" Off Gardener darted violent passion, throwing ladder upon grass, forgetting cherries children. The instant he gone, shrill laugh, loud merry, heard close by, little brown old man's face peeped behind cherry-tree. "How d'ye do?--Boxer me. Did not I bark well? Now I am come play you." The children clapped hands; knew going fun Brownie there--he best little playfellow world. And themselves. Nobody ever saw except children. "Come on!" cried he, his shrill voice, half like old man's, half like baby's. "Who will begin gather cherries?" [Illustration: A little brown old man's face peeped behind cherry-tree.--Page 20] They looked blank; tree high branches sprang, besides, mother said climb. And ladder lay flat upon grass--far heavy little hands move. "What! big boys do not expect poor little fellow like lift ladder myself? Try! I will help you." Whether he helped not, sooner taken hold ladder rose up, almost accord, fixed quite safely tree. "But must climb--mother told us not," said boys, ruefully. "Mother said stand bottom pick cherries." "Very well. Obey mother. I will run tree myself." Before words his mouth Brownie darted ladder like monkey, disappeared among fruit-laden branches. The children looked dismayed minute, till saw merry brown face peeping green leaves top tree. "Biggest fruit always grows highest," cried Brownie. "Stand row, children. Little boys, hold caps: little girls, make bag pinafores. Open mouths shut eyes, see queen send you." They laughed told; whereupon drowned shower cherries--cherries falling like hailstones, hitting heads, cheeks, noses--filling caps pinafores, rolling tumbling grass, till strewn thick leaves autumn rosy fruit. What glorious scramble had--these three little boys three little girls! How laughed jumped knocked heads together picking cherries, yet never quarreled--for heaps, would ridiculous squabble them; besides, whenever began quarrel, Brownie always ran away. Now he merriest lot; ran tree like cat, helped pick cherries, first-rate filling large market-basket. "We eat many liked, must first fill basket," conscientiously said eldest girl; upon set once, filled brim. "Now we will dinner-party," cried Brownie; squatted like Turk, crossed his queer little legs, sticking his elbows upon his knees, way nobody Brownie could manage. "Sit ring! sit ring! we will see eat fastest." The children obeyed. How many cherries devoured, fast it, passes capacity telling. I hope ill next day, cherry-stones swallowed mistake disagree them. But perhaps nothing disagree one one dines Brownie. They ate much, laughing equal proportion, quite forgotten Gardener--when, sudden, heard clicking angrily orchard gate, talking he walked through. "That nasty dog! It was not Boxer, all. A nice joke! find quietly asleep his kennel hunted him, I thought, one end garden other! Now cherries children--bless us, children? And cherries? Why, tree bare blackthorn February! The starlings it, all. Oh dear! oh dear!" "Oh dear! oh dear!" echoed voice behind tree, followed shouts mocking laughter. Not children--they sat demure possible, ring, hands them, centre huge basket cherries, piled full could possibly hold. But Brownie disappeared. "You naughty brats, I will punished!" cried Gardener, furious laughter, he never laughed himself. But nothing wrong; cherries gathered--a large crop--and ladder found safe place--it difficult say harm done done it. So he went growling back house, carrying cherries mistress, coaxed good temper again, she sometimes did; bidding also children behave well him, since he old man, really bad--only cross. As little folks, she slightest intention punishing them; and, Brownie, impossible catch him. So nobody punished all. ADVENTURE THE THIRD BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD WHICH place he often go, he preferred warm snug house. But he felt ill-used, he would wander anywhere, order play tricks upon he thought done harm; for, Brownie, man, he understand best way revenge upon enemies either let alone pay back good evil--it disappoints much, makes exceedingly ashamed themselves. One day Brownie overheard Gardener advising Cook put sour milk his bowl night, instead sweet. "He would never find difference, pigs do. Indeed, it is belief pig, dog, something, empties bowl, Brownie, all. It is clean waste--that is I say." "Then you would better hold tongue, mind business," returned Cook, sharp temper, would stand meddled with. She began abuse Gardener soundly; his wife, standing by, took his part, she always third party scolded him. So squabbled together, till Brownie, hid his coal, put his little hands his little ears. "Dear me, noise mortals make quarrel! They quite deafen me. I must teach better manners." But Cook slammed door to, left Gardener his wife alone, began dispute themselves. "You make fuss nasty pigs, get scraps them," said wife. "It is much importance I everything Cook spare chickens. Never fine chickens last brood!" "I thought ducklings." "How catch up, rude old man! They ducklings, beauties, too--even though never seen water. Where is pond promised make me, I wonder?" "Rubbish, woman! If cows without pond, ducklings may. And silly rear ducklings all? Fine fat chickens deal better. You will find mistake day." "And old Alderney runs dry. You will wish taken advice, fattened sold her." "Alderney cows will not sell fattening, women's advice never worth twopence. Yours is not worth even half-penny. What laughing at?" "I was not laughing," said wife, angrily; and, truth, she, little Brownie, running barrow Gardener wheeling along, much amused people silly squabble nothing. It still early morning; for, whatever old couple's faults might be, laziness one them. The wife rose dawn feed her poultry collect her eggs; husband also got much work breakfast-time many idle man noon. But Brownie beforehand day. When fowls came running fed, big Brahma hen watched ducklings seen wandering forlornly about, clucking mournfully her young brood--she could find anywhere. Had she able speak, she might told large white Aylesbury duck waddled farmyard, waddled again, coaxing her, doubt search pond. But missing were, certainly. "Cluck, cluck, cluck!" mourned miserable hen-mother--and, "Oh, ducklings, ducklings!" cried Gardener's wife--"Who carried beautiful ducklings?" "Rats, maybe," said Gardener, cruelly, he walked away. And he went he heard squeak rat his wheelbarrow. But he could catch it, his wife could catch Aylesbury duck. Of course not. Both were--the Brownie! Just moment six little people came running farmyard. When particularly good, sometimes allowed go Gardener a-milking, carrying his her mug drink milk, warm cow. They scampered him--a noisy tribe, begging taken field, holding six mugs entreatingly. "What! six cupfuls milk, I have not drop spare, Cook always wanting more? Ridiculous nonsense! Get along you; may come field--I cannot hinder that--but you will get milk to-day. Take mugs back kitchen." The poor little folks made best bad business, obeyed; followed Gardener field, rather dolefully. But beautiful morning soon recovered spirits. The grass shone dew, like sheet diamonds, clover smelled sweet, two skylarks singing one another high sky. Several rabbits darted past, great amusement, especially one large rabbit--brown, gray--which dodged out, nearly threw Gardener down, pail all, running across his feet; set laughing, till came Dolly, cow, lay chewing cud large oak-tree. It great fun stir her up, usual, lie down, one other, place she lain night long, making grass flat, warm, perfumy her sweet breath. She let it, stood meekly by; Dolly gentlest cow world. But morning something strange seemed possess her. She altogether refused milked--kicked, plunged, tossed pail, luckily empty. "Bless cow! what is wrong her? It is surely children's fault. Stand off, whole lot you. Soh, Dolly! good Dolly!" But Dolly thing good. She stood switching her tail, looking savage mild animal possibly could look. "It is doing, naughty children! You playing her trick, I know," cried Gardener, great wrath. They assured done nothing, indeed, looked quiet mice innocent lambs. At length biggest boy pointed large wasp settled Dolly's ear. "That accounts everything," said Gardener. But mend everything; he tried drive away kept coming back back again, buzzing round his head cow's voice children thought less like buzz wasp sound person laughing. At length frightened Dolly extent that, one wild bound she darted right away, galloped farther end field. "I will get rope tie her legs together," cried Gardener, fiercely. "She shall repent giving trouble--that she shall!" "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed somebody. The Gardener thought children, gave one angry cuff he walked away. But knew somebody else, surprised when, minute his back turned, Dolly came walking quietly back, led little wee brown man scarcely reached her knees. Yet she let guide her, he gently possible, though string he held her thicker spider web, floating one her horns. "Soh, Dolly! good Dolly!" cried Brownie, mimicking Gardener's voice. "Now we will see do. I want breakfast badly--do not you, little folks?" Of course did, morning air made hungry. "Very well--wait bit, though. Old people served first, know. Besides, I want go bed." "Go bed daylight!" The children laughed, looked quite shy sorry, lest might seemed rude little Brownie. But he--he liked fun; never took offence none meant. He placed milking-stool, high his little legs dangling half-way down, milked milked--Dolly standing still possible--till he filled whole pail. Most astonishing cow! she gave much two cows; delicious milk was--all frothing yellow--richer even Dolly's milk ever before. The children's mouths watered it, word said they--even when, instead giving them, Brownie put his mouth pail, drank drank, till seemed he never going stop. But decidedly relief he popped his head again, lo! pail full ever! "Now, little ones, now's turn. Where mugs?" All answered mournfully, "We have got none. Gardener made us take back again." "Never mind--all right. Gather half dozen biggest buttercups find." "What nonsense!" thought children; it. Brownie laid flowers row upon eldest girl's lap--blew upon one one, turned beautiful golden cup ever seen! "Now, then, every one take his mug, I will fill it." He milked away--each child got drink, cups filled again. And Dolly stood quiet possible--looking benignly round, she would happy supply milk whole parish, Brownie desired it. "Soh, Dolly! Thank you, Dolly!" said he, again, mimicking Gardener's voice, half growling, half coaxing. And he spoke, real voice heard behind hedge. There sound great wasp flying away, made Dolly prick her ears, look old savageness coming back upon her. The children snatched mugs, need, turned buttercups again. Gardener jumped stile, cross two sticks, old rope his hand. "Oh, bother I have had! Breakfast ready, milk yet--and row making lost ducklings. Stand back, children, do not hinder minute. No use begging--not drop milk shall get. Hillo, Dolly? Quiet old girl!" Quiet enough she time--but might well milked plaster cow London milking-shop. Not one ringing drop resounded empty pail; for, peeped in, children saw, amazement, empty. [Illustration: Each child got drink, cups filled again.--Page 32] "The creature's bewitched!" cried Gardener, great fury. "Or else somebody milked her dry already. Have done it? you?" he asked children. They might said No--which literal truth--but would whole truth, knew quite well Dolly milked, also done it. And mother always taught make person believe lie nearly bad telling one. Yet still like betray kind little Brownie. Greatly puzzled, hung heads said nothing. "Look pail again," cried voice side Dolly. And bottom usual quantity milk--no less. The Gardener much astonished. "It must Brownie!" muttered he, frightened tone; and, taking his hat, "Thank you, sir," said he Mr. Nobody--at children burst laughing. But kept counsel, he afraid ask questions. By-and-by his fright wore little. "I hope milk good milk, poison nobody," said he, sulkily. "However, that is affair. You children better tell mother it. I left her farmyard pretty state mind her ducklings." Perhaps Brownie heard this, sorry, he liked children's mother, always kind him. Besides, he never body harm deserve it; though, Brownie, he could hardly said conscience, he something stood place one--a liking see people happy rather miserable. So, instead going bed his big coal day, when, breakfast, children mother came look new brood chickens, he crept hid behind hencoop old mother-hen put, her young ones round her. There great difficulty getting her there, she hen hatched her brood independent principles. Instead sitting upon nice nest Gardener made her, she twice gone little wood close made nest herself, nobody could ever find; she hatched secret, coming every second day fed, vanishing again, till last she re-appeared triumph, her chickens running her. The first brood twelve, fourteen--all her eggs, course, she uncommonly proud them. So Gardener, mistress--who liked young things. Such picture were! fourteen soft, yellow, fluffy things, running mother. It troublesome business catch--first her, them, put coop. The old hen resisted, pecked furiously Gardener's legs, chickens ran frantic terror, chirping wildly answer her clucking. At last, however, little family safe shelter, chickens counted over, see none lost scuffle. How funny were! looking innocent yet wise, chickens do--peering world mother's wing, hopping her back, snuggled together her breast, nothing seen mass yellow legs, like great centiped. "How happy old hen is," said children's mother, looking on, looking compassionately forlorn old hen, hatched ducklings, kept wandering farmyard, clucking miserably, "Those poor ducklings, become them? If rats killed them, found feathers something; weasels would sucked brains left them. They must stolen, wandered away, died cold hunger--my poor ducklings!" The mistress sighed, she could bear living thing suffer. And children nearly cried thought might happening pretty ducklings. That minute little wee brown face peered hole hencoop, making old mother-hen fly furiously it--as she slightest shadow enemy her little ones. However, harm happened--only guinea-fowl suddenly ran across farmyard, screaming usual harsh voice. But usual sort guinea-fowl, larger handsomer theirs. "Oh, beauty creature! ever come farmyard," cried delighted children; started it, catch possible. But ran, ran--through gate lane; guinea-fowl still ran them, until, turning round corner, lost sight it, immediately saw something else, equally curious. Sitting top big thistle--so big he must climb like tree--was Brownie. His legs crossed, his arms too, his little brown cap stuck knowingly one side, he laughing heartily. "How do? Here I again. I thought I would not go bed all. Shall I help find ducklings? Very well! come along." They crossed field, Brownie running beside them, fast could, though he looked old man; sometimes turning legs arms like Catherine wheel--which tried imitate, generally failed, bruised fingers noses. He lured till came wood, green path it, well knew neighborhood, none children ever seen before. It led beautiful pond, clear crystal blue sky. Large trees grew round it, dipping branches water, looking glass. And roots quantities primroses--the biggest primroses little girls ever seen. Down dropped fat knees, squashing primroses gathered, though tried gather all; smallest child even began cry her hands full flowers dropped her fingers. But boys, older practical, rather despised primroses. "I thought come look ducklings," said eldest. "Mother fretting dreadfully her ducklings. Where be?" "Shut eyes, you will see," said Brownie, laughed, it; opened eyes again, behold whole fleet ducklings sailing roots old willow-tree, one other, looking fat content possible, swimming naturally lived pond--and particularly pond, days. "Count them," said Brownie, "the whole eight--quite correct. And try catch them--if can." Easier said done. The boys set work great satisfaction--boys enjoy hunting something. They coaxed them--they shouted them--they threw little sticks them; soon wanted go one way fleet ducklings immediately turned round sailed another way, deliberately majestically, children could help laughing. As little Brownie, he sat branch willow-tree, his legs dangling surface pond, kicking water-spiders, grinning his might. At length, quite tired out, spite fun, children begged his help, he took compassion them. "Turn round three times see find," shouted he. Immediately little boy found his arms, little girl her pinafore, fine fat duckling. And eight them, two elder children couple. They rather cold damp, slightly uncomfortable cuddle, ducks used cuddling. Poor things! struggled hard get away. But children hugged tight, ran fast legs could carry wood, forgetting, joy, even say "Thank you" little Brownie. When reached mother she glad they, she never thought see her ducklings again; back alive uninjured, watch running old hen, received ecstasy delight, exciting, nobody thought asking single question found. When mother ask, children told her Brownie's taking beautiful pond--and wonderful pond was; green trees round it; large primroses grew. They never tired talking seeking it. But odd thing that, seek might, never could find again. Many day little people roam one one, together, round wood, often getting sadly draggled mud torn brambles--but beautiful pond never found again. Nor ducklings, I suppose; wandered farmyard, old mother-hen's great content. They grew fat respectable ducks--five white ones three gray ones--waddling about, content, though never saw water, except tank placed paddle in. They lived lazy, peaceful, pleasant life long time, last killed eaten green peas, one other, family's great satisfaction, own. ADVENTURE THE FOURTH BROWNIE'S RIDE FOR little Brownie, though given horsemanship, take ride, remarkable one was. Shall I tell it? The six little children got present something longed lives--a pony. Not rocking-horse, real live pony--a Shetland pony, too, traveled way Shetland Isles Devonshire--where every body wondered it, creature seen neighborhood years years. She bigger donkey, her coat, instead smooth like horse's, shaggy like young bear's. She long tail, never cut, deal hair her mane her eyes gave her quite fierce countenance. In fact, among mild tame Devonshire beasts, little Shetland pony looked almost like wild animal. But reality she gentlest creature world. Before she many days them, she began know children quite well; followed about, ate corn bowl held her; nay, one day, eldest little girl offered her bread-and-butter, she stooped her head took child's hand, like young lady. Indeed, Jess--that her name--was altogether lady-like her behavior, Cook allowed her walk back-door, she stood politely warming her nose kitchen-fire minute two, turned round politely walked again. But she never mischief; quiet gentle creature she bade fair soon become great pet household dog, cat, kittens, puppies, fowls, ducks, cow, pig, members family. The one disliked her, grumbled her, Gardener. This odd; because, though cross children, old man kind dumb beasts. Even his pig knew his voice grunted, held his nose scratched; he always gave successive pig name, Jack Dick, called it, quite affectionate them, one other, day killed. But English pigs--and pony Scotch--and Devonshire Gardener hated every thing Scotch, he said; besides, he used groom's work, pony required deal grooming account her long hair. More Gardener threatened clip short, turn her regular English pony, children distress mother forbade spoiling Jessie's personal appearance. At length, keep things smooth, avoid rough words even blows poor Jess sometimes got, sought village boy look her, found great rough, shock-headed lad named Bill, who, shillings week, consented come every morning learn beginning groom's business; hoping end, his mother said he should, sitting, like squire's fat coachman, broad he long, top hammer-cloth grand carriage, nothing day drive pair horses stout miles along road back again. Bill would liked much, he thought, he could coachman once, one thing he disliked, work. He much preferred lie sun day nothing; he agreed come take care Jess she little pony, looking her seemed next door nothing. But he tried it, he found his mistake. True, Jess gentle beast, quiet old mother-hen fourteen chicks used, instead roosting rest fowls, come regularly portion cow-she would partitioned stable, settle corner Jess's manger night; morning chicks would seen running fearlessly among her feet her nose. But, that, she required little management, she like her long hair roughly handled; took long time clean her; and, though she scream like silly little children her hair combed, I afraid she sometimes kicked bounced about, giving Bill deal trouble--all trouble, impatient Bill was. And he keep within call, children wanted pony hours. She especial property, insisted upon learning ride--even got saddle. Hard work stick Jess's bare back, degrees boys it, turn turn about, even gave sisters turn too--a little one--just round field back again, quite enough, considered, girls. But kind little sisters, held could fall, led Jess carefully quietly: altogether behaved elder brothers should. Nor squabble much among themselves, though sometimes rather difficult keep turns fair, remember accurately which. But best, being, whole, extremely good children. And happy pony, would ashamed quarrel her. Also, one curious thing kept good behavior. Whenever begin misconduct themselves--to want ride turns, domineer one another, boys, joining together, tried domineer girls, I grieve say boys seldom do--they used hear air, right heads, crack unseen whip. It none theirs, got whip; felicity father promised could ride like young gentleman ladies; mistaking sound--indeed, always startled Jess she set galloping, could caught many minutes. This happened several times, one said, "Perhaps it is Brownie." Whether not, made behave better good while; till one unfortunate day two eldest began contending ride foremost hindmost Jess's back, "Crick--crack!" went whip air, frightening pony much she kicked her heels, tossed boys her head, scampered off, followed loud "Ha, ha, ha!" It certainly come two boys, fallen--quite safely, rather unpleasantly--into large nettle-bed; whence crawled out, rubbing arms legs, looking much ashamed complain. But rather frightened little cross, Jess took skittish fit, refused caught mounted again, till bell rang school--when she grew meek possible. Too late--for children obliged run indoors, got rides whole day. Jess incident supposed friendly terms Brownie rest household. Indeed, she came, children taken care lead her coal-cellar door introduce her properly--for knew Brownie jealous strangers, often played tricks. But piece civility he would sure, thought, take her his protection. And sometimes, little Shetlander restless pricked her ears, looking preternaturally wise shaggy brows hers, children used say one another, "Perhaps she sees Brownie." Whether she not, Jess sometimes seemed see good deal others see, apparently favorite Brownie, she grew thrived much she soon became pride delight children whole family. You would hardly known her rough, shaggy, half-starved little beast arrived weeks before. Her coat silky, her limbs graceful, her head full intelligence, every body admired her. Then even Gardener began admire her too. "I think I will get upon her back; save walking village," said he, one day. And she actually carried him--though, his feet nearly touched ground, looked man carrying pony, pony man. And children laughed immoderately, he never tried afterward. Nor Bill neither, though he thought he like ride, got astride Jess; she quickly ducked her head down, he tumbled it. Evidently she her tastes her riders, much preferred little people big ones. Pretty Jess! cantering round paddock young folk she really quite picture. And last she got saddle--a new, beautiful saddle, pommel take on, suit boys girls--how proud were, Jess included! That day allowed take her market-town--Gardener leading her, Bill could trusted--and every body, even blacksmith, hoped by-and-by pleasure shoeing her, said, beautiful pony she was! After this, Gardener treated Jess great deal better, showed Bill groom her, kept close too, Bill like all. He lazy lad, whenever he could shirk work he it; many time children wanted Jess, either nobody saddle her, she properly groomed, Bill away his dinner, wait till he came back could put her order taken ride like genteel animal--which I afraid neither pony children enjoyed half much old ways Bill came. Still, gradually becoming excellent little horsemen horsewomen--even youngest, four years old, rest tender over, often held Jess's back given ride her turn she good little girl, never cried it. And seldomer seldomer heard mysterious sound whip air, warned quarreling--Brownie hated quarreling. [Illustration: Jess quickly ducked her head Bill tumbled it.] In fact, trouble Bill, never came his work time, never things wanted, ill-natured, lazy, cross children, disliked much. "I wish Brownie would punish you," said one boys; "you would behave better then." "The Brownie!" cried Bill, contemptuously; "if I caught him, I would kick air like this!" And he kicked his cap--his cap, was--which, strange relate, flew right up, ever high, lodged top tree overhung stable, dangled weeks weeks, time poor Bill go bareheaded. He much vexed, revenged vexing children sorts ways. They would told mother, asked her send Bill away, she great many anxieties then, old grandmother ill, like make fuss thing would trouble her. So Bill staid on, nobody found bad, ill-natured, lazy boy he was. But one day mother sent suddenly, knowing she able come home again. She sad, children, loved grandmother--and carriage drove stood crying round front-door ever long. The servants even cried too--all Bill. "It is ill wind blows nobody good," said he. "What jolly time I shall have! I will nothing day long. Those troublesome children shall not Jess ride; I will keep her stable, she will not get dirty, I shall trouble cleaning her. Hurrah! fun!" He put his hands his pockets, sat whistling best part afternoon. The children unhappy, day quite forgot Jess; next morning, lessons over, came begging ride. "You cannot get one. The stable-door's locked I have lost key." (He his pocket time.) "How poor Jess get her dinner?" cried thoughtful little girl. "Oh, hungry she be!" And child quite distress, two girls. But boys angry sorry. "It stupid you, Bill, lose key. Look find it, else break open door." "I will not," said Bill; "I dare say key turn night, does not, cares? You get riding enough much. I will bother it, Jess either." And Bill sauntered away. He big fellow, little lads rather afraid him. But he walked, he could keep his hand his trowsers-pocket, key felt growing heavier heavier, till he expected every minute tumble come his boots--convicting children told lie. Nobody habit telling lies them, never suspected him, went innocently searching key--Bill clutching fast. But every time he touched it, he felt his fingers pinched, cockroach his pocket--or little lobster--or something, anyhow, claws. At last, fairly frightened, he made excuse go cow-she would, took key his pocket looked it, finally hid corner manger, among hay. As he so, he heard extraordinary laugh, certainly Dolly cow, and, he went she would, he felt sort pinch his ankles, made angry he kept striking his whip directions, hit nobody nobody there. But Jess--who, soon she heard children's voices, set melancholy whinnying behind locked stable-door--began neigh energetically. And Boxer barked, hens cackled, guinea-fowls cried "Come back, come back!" usual insane fashion--indeed, whole farmyard seemed excited state, children got frightened lest Gardener scold them, ran away, leaving Bill master field. What idle day he had! How he sat wall his hands his pockets, lounged upon fence, sauntered around garden! At length, absolutely tired nothing, he went talked Gardener's wife she hanging her clothes. Gardener gone lower field, little folks him, he knew nothing Bill's idling, might come end. By-and-by Bill thought time go home his supper. "But first I will give Jess her corn," said he, "double quantity, I need come back give her her breakfast early morning. Soh! greedy beast! I will presently, do not stop noise." For Jess, sound his footsteps, heard whinny imploring manner, enough melted heart stone. "The key--where earth I put key?" cried Bill, whose constant habit lay things his hand forget he put them, causing endless loss time searching them--as now. At last he suddenly remembered corner cow's manger, he felt sure he left it. But key there. "You cannot eaten it, silly old cow," said he, striking Dolly nose she rubbed herself him--she affectionate beast. "Nor you, stupid old hen!" kicking mother brood, who, her fourteen chicks, shut usual roosting-place--Jess's stable--kept pecking Dolly's legs. "It cannot gone without hands--of course cannot." But certainly key gone. What world Bill do? Jess kept making pitiful complaining. No wonder, she tasted food since morning. It would made kind-hearted person quite sad hear her, thinking exceedingly hungry poor pony must be. Little Bill care that, anything, except he sure get trouble soon he found out. When he heard Gardener coming farmyard, children him, Bill bolted wall like flash lightning, ran away home, leaving poor Jess her fate. All way he seemed hear his heels little dog yelping, swarm gnats buzzing round his head, altogether perplexed bewildered, he got his mother's cottage he escaped bed, pulled blanket his ears shut noise dog gnats, last turned sound like somebody laughing. It his mother, she did not often laugh, poor soul!--Bill bothered her quite much that, he knew it. Dreadfully frightened, he hid his head bedclothes, determined go sleep think nothing till next day. Meantime Gardener returned, little people trooping him. He rather kinder usual day, he knew mother gone away trouble, he let help roll gravel, fetch Dolly milked, watch milk her cow-she would--where, nearly winter, she always spent night now. They well amused forgot disappointment ride, Jess remind her whinnying. For soon Bill gone she grew silent. At last one little girl, one cried Jess's left hungry, remembered poor pony, and, peeping crevice cow-she would, saw her stand contentedly munching large bowlful corn. "So Bill find key. I am glad," thought kind little maiden, make sure looked again, when--what think she beheld squatting manger? Something brown--either large brown rat, small brown man. But she held her tongue, since, little girl, people sometimes laughed her strange things she saw. She quite certain she see them, that. So she rest children went indoors bed. When fast asleep, something happened. Something curious, youngest boy, who, thinking he heard Jess neighing, got look out, afraid tell, lest he laughed at, went back bed immediately. In middle night, little old brown man carrying lantern, least light his hand looked like lantern--went unlocked Jess's stable, patted her pretty head. At first she started, soon she grew quiet pleased, let he chose her. He began rubbing her down, making funny hissing his mouth Bill did, grooms do--I never could find why. But Jess evidently liked it, stood good possible. [Illustration: Up bank she scrambled, her long hair dripping.--Page 55] "Is not nice clean?" said wee man, talking her she human being, Brownie. "And I dare say poor little legs ache standing long. Shall run together? moon shines bright clear, cold night. Dear me! I am talking poetry." But Brownies poetical fairies, quite commonplace, sorts work. So, he talked, he saddling bridling Jess, she objecting least. Finally, he jumped her back. "'Off, said stranger--off, off, away!'" sang Brownie mimicking song Cook's. People house often heard songs repeated oddest way, room room, everybody fancying somebody else it. But Brownie. "Now, 'A southerly wind cloudy sky proclaim hunting morning!'" Or night--for middle night, though bright day--and Jess galloped Brownie sat her back merrily gone hunting together days. Such steeple-chase was! They cleared farmyard single bound, went flying road, across ploughed field, wood. Then open country, by-and-by dark, muddy lane--and oh! muddy Devonshire lanes sometimes! "Let us go water wash ourselves," said Brownie, coaxed Jess deep stream, she swam bravely possible--she frolic since she left her native Shetland Isles. Up bank she scrambled, her long hair dripping she water-dog instead pony. Brownie, too, shook like rat beaver, throwing shower round directions. "Never mind; again, lass!" he urged Jess water more. Out she came, wetter brisker ever, went back home lane, wood, ploughed field, galloping like wind, tossing back her ears mane tail, perfectly frantic enjoyment. But she reached her stable, plight she would driven respectable groom frantic too. Her sides white foam, mud sticking her like plaster. As her beautiful long hair, caked together tangle, combs world would never make smooth again. Her mane especially plaited knots, people Devonshire call elf-locks, say, find horses, fairies riding them. Certainly, poor Jess pretty well ridden night. When dawn began break, Gardener got looked farmyard, his sharp eye caught sight stable-door wide open. "Well done, Bill," shouted he, "up early last. One hour breakfast worth three after." But Bill there; Jess, trembling shaking, foam, muddy head foot, looking perfectly cheerful her mind. And her fore legs ran small creature Gardener mistook Tiny, Tiny gray, dog brown, course! I like tell said Bill when, hour breakfast-time, he came skulking farm. In fact, words failing, Gardener took good stick laid Bill's shoulders, saying he would either this, tell mistress him, he left stable-door open night, bad fellow stolen Jess, galloped her across country, till, she had not cleverest pony world, she never could got back again. Bill durst contradict explanation story, especially key found hanging proper place kitchen door. And he went fetch it, he heard extraordinary sound coal-cellar close by--like somebody snoring laughing. Bill took his heels, come back whole hour. But he come back, he made busy possible. He cleaned Jess, half day's work least. Then he took little people ride, afterward put his stable beautiful order, altogether changed Bill, Gardener told he must left home brought back somebody else: whether not, boy certainly improved, less occasion find fault afterward. Jess lived quite old pony, carried great many people--little people always, she herself never grew bigger. But I do not think she ever carried Brownie again. ADVENTURE THE FIFTH BROWNIE ON THE ICE WINTER grand time six little children especially frost snow. This happened seldom enough greatest possible treat happen; never lasted long, winters warm Devonshire. There little lake three fields off, made splendid sliding-place imaginable. No skaters went near it--it large enough; besides, nobody skate, neighborhood lonely. The lake looked loneliest place imaginable. It deep--not deep enough drown man--but gravelly bottom, always clear. Also, trees round grew thick sheltered completely wind, so, freeze, generally froze smooth sheet glass. "The lake bears!" grand event, rare, occur, news came farm, children carried quickly mother. For she promised that, thing happen year--it happen every year--lessons stopped entirely, go lake slide, liked, day long. So one morning, Christmas, eldest boy ran countenance great delight. "Mother, mother, lake bears!" (It rather compliment call lake, twenty yards across forty long.) "The lake really bears!" "Who says so?" "Bill. Bill hour morning, made us two beautiful slides, he says--an upslide down-slide. May go directly?" The mother hesitated. "You promised, know," pleaded children. "Very well, then; careful." "And may slide day long, never come home dinner thing?" "Yes, like. Only Gardener must go you, stay day." This like all; nor, Gardener spoken to, he. "You bothering children! I wish may get good ducking lake! Serve right making lose day's work, look little monkeys. I have great mind tell mother I will not it." But he not, fond his mistress. He also fond his work, he notion play. I think saying of, "All work play makes Jack dull boy," must applied him, Gardener, whatever he boy, certainly dull melancholy man. The children used say he idle Bill could kneaded one, baked oven--a warm oven--they would come rather pleasant person. As was, Gardener thing pleasant person; all, spend long day with, ice, one needs one's cheerfulness good-humor bear pinched fingers numbed toes, trips tumbles, various uncomfortablenesses. "He will growl us day long--he will regular spoil-sport!" lamented children. "Oh! mother, might not go alone?" "No!" said mother; her "No" meant no, though she always kind. They argued point more, started off, rather downhearted. But soon regained spirits, bright, clear, frosty day--the sun shining, though enough melt ice, sufficient lie like thin sprinkling grass, turn brown branches white ones. The little people danced along keep warm, carrying basket held lunch. A harmless lunch was--just large brown loaf lump cheese, knife cut with. Tossing basket fun, managed tumble knife out, search long grass, Gardener came up, grumpily enough. "To think trusting children one table-knives basket! fool Cook must be! I will tell her so; they are lost she will blame me: give things." He put knife angrily one pocket. "Perhaps cut hole it," said one children, rather pleased tone otherwise; he turned lunch grass crammed pocket, hiding basket behind hedge. "I am sure I will trouble carrying it," said he, children cried this; "and shall not carry either, you will knock spoil it. And lunch getting warm pocket, why, much better cold day." It lively joke, knew pocket dirty; indeed, little girls seen stuff dead rat day before. They looked ready cry; help them, except going back complaining mother, like that. Besides, knew that, though Gardener cross, he trustworthy, she would never let go lake without him. So followed him, trying good could--though difficult work. One proposed pelting snowballs, pelted other. But first--which fell his neck--he turned round furiously, never sent second, walked behind meek mice. As went, heard little steps pattering them. "Perhaps Brownie play us--I wish he would," whispered youngest girl eldest boy, whose hand she generally held; little pattering steps sounded again, traveling snow, saw nobody--so said nothing. The children would liked go straight ice; Gardener insisted taking mile round, look extraordinary animal farmer got--sent his brother Australia. The two old men stood gossiping long children wearied extremely. Every minute seemed hour till got ice. At last one pulled Gardener's coat-tails, whispered quite ready go. "Then I am not," he waited ever much longer, got drink hot cider, made quite lively little while. But time reached lake, he cross ever. He struck ice his stick, made attempt see really bear--though he would allow children go one step upon till he tried. "I know does not bear, you will go home again--a good thing too--saves losing day's work." "Try, try; Bill said bore," implored boys, looked wistfully two beautiful slides--just Bill said, one one down--stretching across lake; "of course bears, Bill could made slides." "Bill's ass!" said Gardener, put his heavy foot cautiously ice. Just seen jumping across creature certainly never seen ice before. It made extraordinary bounds long hind legs, little fore legs tucked front wanted carry muff; long, stiff tail sticking straight behind, balance apparently. The children first started surprise, burst laughing, funniest creature, funniest way getting along, ever seen lives. "It is kangaroo!" said Gardener, great excitement. "It got loose--and it is sure lost--and way Mr. Giles in! I must go tell him. Or stop, I will try catch it." But vain--it darted twice across ice, dodging him, were; coming close he nearly caught tail--to children's great delight--then vanished entirely. "I must go tell Mr. Giles directly," said Gardener, stopped. For he promised leave children; wild-goose chase, escaped kangaroo. But he might get half crown reward, he sure another glass cider. "You stop quiet here, I will back five minutes," said he children. "You may go little way ice--I think it is sound enough; mind do not tumble in, there will nobody pull out." "Oh no," said children, clapping hands. They care tumbling in, quite glad nobody pull out. They hoped Gardener would stop long time away--only, one suggested he seen hurrying across snowy field, he taken away lunch his pocket, too. Off darted, three elder boys, good run; biggest girls followed them; soon whole four skimming one other, fast railway train, across slippery ice. And, like railway train, collision, came tumbling one other, great screaming laughing, high bank side. The two younger ones stood mournfully watching others opposite bank--when stood beside small brown man. "Ho-ho! little people," said he, coming taking hold hand each. His warm cold, quite comfortable. And then, somehow, found mouths nice lozenge--I think peppermint, sure; comforted still more. "Did want play you?" cried Brownie; "then I am. What shall do? Have turn ice together?" No sooner said done. The two children felt floating along--it like floating running--with Brownie them; lake, lake, across lake, interfering sliders--indeed, great deal better sliding. Rosy breathless, toes nice warm, hands feeling like mince-pies taken oven--the little ones came standstill. The elder ones stopped sliding, looked toward Brownie entreating eyes. He swung willow bough, turned head heels ice. "Halloo! do not mean say big ones want race too! Well, come along--if two eldest give slide little ones." He watched take tiny sister them, slide her one slide another, screaming delight. Then he took two middle children either hand. "One, two, three, away!" Off started--scudding along light feathers fast steam-engines, smooth, black ice, clear could see bits stick water-grasses frozen it, even little fishes swimming far below--if looked long enough. When fair turns, began frightfully hungry. [Illustration: The two little children felt floating along--with Brownie them--Page 64] "Catch fish dinner, I will lend hook," said Brownie. At laughed, looked rather grave. Pulling cold, raw live fish ice eating pleasant idea dinner. "Well, would like have? Let little one choose." She said, thinking minute, she like currant-cake. "And I would give bit it--a large bit--I would indeed!" added she, almost tears her eyes--she hungry. "Do it, then!" said Brownie, his little squeaking voice. Immediately stone little girl sitting on--a round, hard stone, cold!--turned nice hot cake--so hot she jumped directly. As soon she saw was, she clapped her hands joy. "Oh, beautiful, beautiful cake! have not got knife cut it." The boys felt pockets, somehow knives never wanted. "Look! you have got one hand!" said Brownie little one; minute bit stick she held turned bread-knife--silver, ivory handle--big enough sharp enough, without sharp. For youngest girl allowed use sharp knives, though she liked cutting things excessively, especially cakes. "That do. Sit carve dinner. Fair shares do not let body eat much. Now begin, madam," said Brownie, quite politely, she ever old. Oh, proud little girl was. How bravely she set work, cut five biggest slices ever saw, gave her brothers sisters, going take sixth slice herself, she remembered Brownie. "I beg pardon," said she, politely he, though she little girl, turned round wee brown man. But he nowhere seen. The slices cake children's hands remained cake, uncommonly good was, substantial eating nearly dinner; cake turned suddenly stone again, knife bit stick. For Gardener coming clumping along bank lake, growling he went. "Have got kangaroo?" shouted children, determined civil, possible. "This place bewitched, I think," said he, "The kangaroo fast asleep cow-she would. What! dare laugh me?" But had not laughed all. And found laughing matter, poor children, Gardener came ice, began scold order about. He perfectly savage crossness; people Giles's Farm laughed much, he like laughed at--and top field he chance met his mistress, she asked severely he could think leaving children alone. Altogether, his conscience pricked good deal, people's consciences prick them, sometimes get angry people, silly, makes matters worse. "What time?" said he. "All five minutes?" said oldest boy, mischievously; Gardener away five minutes, he staid full hour. Also, he fumbled his pocket children's lunch--to stop tongues, perhaps--he found there. They set great outcry; for, spite cake, could eaten little more. Indeed, frost effect upon appetites, felt unlike celebrated gentleman told "He ate cow, ate calf, He ate ox, ate half; He ate church, he ate steeple, He ate priest, people, And said he had not enough then." "We are hungry, hungry! Could not go back fetch us dinner?" cried they, entreatingly. "Not I, indeed. You may go back dinner yourselves. You shall, indeed, I want dinner too. Two hours plenty long enough stop ice." "It is not two hours--it is one." "Well, one better more. You are right now--and might soon tumble in, break legs slide. So come away home." It was not kind Gardener, I do not wonder children felt hard; indeed, eldest boy resisted stoutly. "Mother said might stop day, stop day. You may go home like." "I will not, shall!" said Gardener, smacking whip he carried his hand. "Stop till I catch you, I will give back, fine gentleman." And he tried follow, little fellow darted across ice, objecting either caught whipped. It may rather naughty, I afraid great fun dodging Gardener down; he timid go slippery ice, sometimes getting close whip nearly touched lad. "Bless us! there is kangaroo again!" said he, starting. Just he caught boy, lifted whip, creature seen hop-hopping bank bank. "I cannot surely mistaken time; I must catch it." Which seemed quite easy, limped lame, frost bitten toes, poor beast! Gardener went it, walking cautiously slippery, crackling ice, never minding whether he walked slides, though called his nailed boots would spoil them. But whether ice bears boy bear man, whether lame step kangaroo came great crack, I tell. However, Gardener reached middle lake, ice suddenly broke, he popped.--The kangaroo too, apparently, seen afterward. What hullaballoo poor man made! Not he drowning--the lake shallow drown body, he got terribly wet, water cold. He soon scrambled out, boys helping him; he hobbled home fast he could, even saying thank you, taking least notice them. Indeed, nobody took notice them--nobody came fetch them, might staid sliding whole afternoon. Only somehow feel quite easy minds. And though hole ice closed immediately, seemed firm ever, still like slide upon again. "I think better go home tell mother every thing," said one them. "Besides, ought see become poor Gardener. He wet." "Yes, oh, funny he looked!" And burst laughing recollection figure he cut, scrambling ice his trowsers dripping knees, water running his boots, making little pool, wherever he stepped. "And freezes hard, time he gets home his clothes stiff board. His wife put fire thaw he get them." Again little people burst shouts laughter. Although laughed, little sorry poor old Gardener, hoped great harm come him, he got safe home dried his warm fire. The frosty mist beginning already rise, sun, though still high sky, looked like ball red-hot iron six children went homeward across fields--merry enough still, quite merry hours before. "Let us hope mother will not vexed us," said they, "but let us come back to-morrow. It was not fault Gardener tumbled in." As somebody said this, heard quite distinctly, "Ha, ha, ha!" "Ho, ho, ho!" sound little steps pattering behind. But whatever thought, nobody ventured say fault Brownie. ADVENTURE THE SIXTH AND LAST BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES TILL next time; Brownie house, one say his tricks last. For there is stopping Brownie, getting rid either. This one followed family house house, generation generation--never older, sometimes seeming even grow younger tricks he played. In fact, though he looked like old man, he perpetual child. To children he never harm, quite contrary. And his chief misdoings vexed children. But he gradually made friends several his grown enemies. Cook, instance, ceased lazy night late morning, found black footmarks her white table cloth. And Brownie found his basin milk waiting him, night night, behind coal-cellar door. Bill, too, got well enough his pony, Jess taken night-rides. No ducks lost; Dolly gave her milk quite comfortably whoever milked her. Alas! either Bill Gardener's wife now. After adventure ice, poor Gardener seldom appeared; he did, two crutches, he rheumatism his feet, could stir outside his cottage door. Bill, therefore, double work; probably better Bill. The garden take care itself; winter-time, much signify. Besides, Brownie seldom went garden, except summer; hard weather he preferred stop his coal-cellar. It might lively place, warm, he liked it. He company there, too; cat kittens--the kitten he used tease grown now--they put hamper coal-cellar; cold nights Brownie used jump beside them, warm cozy kitten himself. The little things never heard mew; may supposed liked his society. And old mother-cat evidently bore malice whipping she got mistake; Brownie must found means coaxing her over. One thing may sure of--all she her kittens his coal-cellar, he took care never turn mouse. He spending winter, whole, comfortably, without much trouble either his neighbors, one day, coal-cellar nearly empty, two men, great wagon-load coals behind them, came door, Gardener's wife following. "My man says you are give cellar good cleaning put in," said she, her sharp voice; "and do not lazy it. It will take ten minutes, it is nearly coal-dust, except one big lump corner--you might clear too." "Stop, it is Brownie's lump! better meddle it," whispered little scullery-maid. "Do not meddle matters cannot concern you," said Gardener's wife, thinking nice help would her fire. To sure, her lump coal, she thought she might take it; mistress would never miss it, Brownie either. He must silly old Brownie live lump coal. So she argued herself, made men lift it. "You must lift it, see, sweep coal-cellar clean. And may well put barrow, I will wheel way." This she said quite civil voice, lest tell her, stood done. It done without thing happening, except large rat ran coal-cellar door, bouncing her feet, frightening her much she nearly tumbled down. "See nonsense talk Brownies living coal-cellar. Nothing lives rats, I will poisoned pretty soon, get rid them." But she rather frightened same, rat big rat, looked her, darted past, wild, bright, mischievous eyes--brown eyes, course--that she jumped surprise. However, she got her lump coal, wheeling quietly away, nobody seeing, her cottage bottom garden. She hard-worked woman, her husband's illness made things harder her. Still, she quite easy taking belong her. "I do not suppose body miss coal," she repeated. "I dare say mistress would given I asked her; Brownie's lump--fudge! Bless us! what is that?" For barrow began creak dreadfully, every creak sounded like cry child, wheel going leg crushing poor little bones. "What horrid noise! I must grease barrow. If I knew keep grease-box. All goes wrong, old man's laid up. Oh, dear! oh dear!" For suddenly barrow tilted over, though single stone near, big coal tumbled ground, broke thousand pieces. Gathering hopeless, made mess gravel-walk, old woman thankful her misfortune happened behind privet hedge, nobody likely come. "I will take broom sweep to-morrow. Nobody goes near orchard now, except I hang clothes; I need say nothing old man body. But ah! deary me, beautiful lot coal I have lost!" She stood looked mournfully, went her cottage, she found two three little children keeping Gardener company. They dislike now; he much kinder he used be--so quiet patient, though he suffered much. And he never reproached always remembered--how ever since he ice he got rheumatism. So, one made point going see every day, telling funny things could think of--indeed, contest among first make Gardener laugh. They succeed exactly; managed make smile; he always gentle grateful them; sometimes thought rather nice his ill. But his wife pleasant; she grumbled day long, snapped his visitors; especially snappish day, she lost her big coal. "I cannot children come bothering here," said she, crossly. "I want wring clothes, hang dry. Be you!" "Let us stop little--just tell Gardener one curious thing Dolly pig--and we will help take clothes orchard; carry basket us--we can, indeed." That last thing woman wished; she knew children would sure see mess gravel-walk--and inquisitive children--they noticed every thing. They would want know it, bits coal came there. It awkward position. But people take people's property often find awkward positions. "Thank you, young gentlemen," said she, quite politely; "but indeed basket heavy you. However, may stop gossip little longer old man. He likes it." And, shut Gardener his bedroom, she went, carrying basket her head, hung her clothes carefully out--the big things lines fruit trees, little things, stockings pocket handkerchiefs, stuck gooseberry-bushes, spread upon clean green grass. "Such fine day is! they will dry directly," said she, cheerfully, herself. "Plenty sun, breath wind blow about. I will leave hour two, come fetch grows dark. Then I shall get folding done bedtime, clear day ironing to-morrow." But she fetch in, bundled together dusk evening, never sight clothes! They twisted oddest way--the stockings turned inside out, heels toes tucked legs; sleeves shirts tied together double knots, pocket-handkerchiefs made round balls, tight pelted person would given hard blows indeed. And whole looked if, instead lying quietly grass bushes, dragged heaps mud stamped upon, clean inch upon end end. "What horrid mess!" cried Gardener's wife, first angry, frightened. "But I know is; nasty Boxer got loose again. It is he done it." "Boxer would not tie shirt-sleeves double knots, make balls pocket-handkerchiefs," Gardener heard answer, solemnly. "Then it is horrid children; always mischief other--just let catch them!" "You would better not," said somebody voice exactly like Gardener's, though he declared he spoken word. Indeed, he fast asleep. "Well, it is extraordinary thing I ever heard of," Gardener's wife said, supposing she talking her husband time; soon she held her tongue, she found among clothes sorts queer marks--marks fingers, toes, heels, mud all, coal-dust, black black could be. Now, place big coal tumbled barrow fully fifty yards orchard, and, coal could come clothes, clothes could go without hands, conclusion she could arrive was--well, particular conclusion all! It late night begin washing again; besides, she extremely tired, her husband woke rather worse usual, she bundled clothes anyhow corner, put kitchen rights, went mournfully bed. Next morning she got long light, washed her clothes again, and, impossible dry fire, went more, began spreading usual corner, hopeless melancholy manner. While she it, little folks came trooping around her. She did not scold time, she low-spirited. "No! old man is not better, I do not fancy he ever be," said she, answer questions. "And every thing's going wrong us--just listen!" And she told trick played her clothes. The little people tried laugh, funny; even now, minute she done hanging out, something droll way clothes blew about, without wind; shirts hanging necks downward, man inside them; drawers standing stiffly astride gooseberry-bushes, world held pair legs still. As Gardener's night-caps--long, white cotton, tassel top--they alarming look at; like head stuck top pole. The whole thing peculiar, old woman comical her despair, children, trying hard keep in, last broke shouts laughter. She turned furiously upon them. "It it!" "No, indeed was not!" said they, jumping farther escape her blows. For she got one her clothes-props, laying her reckless manner. However, she hurt nobody, she suddenly burst out, laughing, crying. "It is cruel thing, whoever done it, play tricks poor old body like me, sick husband she works hard for, child help her. But I do not care. I will wash clothes again, it is twenty times over, I will hang place, make ashamed yourselves." Perhaps little people ashamed themselves, though really done mischief. But knew quite well done it, tell; afraid, so, vex Brownie much he would never come play more. So looked one another without speaking, Gardener's wife emptied her basket dried her eyes, said her, kindly: "Perhaps harm may come clothes time. We will sit watch till dry." "Just like; I do not care. Them hides find, plays tricks knows stop  them." It civil speech, things hard poor old woman. She awake nearly night, washing daybreak; her eyes red crying, her steps weary slow. The little children felt quite sorry her, and, instead going play, sat watching clothes patiently possible. Nothing came near them. Sometimes, before, things seemed dance without hands, turn odd shapes, people inside them; creature seen sound heard. And though neither wind sun, soon linen perfectly dry. "Fetch one mother's baskets, we will fold tidily possible--that is, girls it, it is business--and boys carry safe Gardener's cottage." So said they, liking say could trust sight fear Brownie, whom, indeed, expecting see peer round every bush. They began secret fear he rather naughty Brownie; then, eldest little girl whispered, "He Brownie, knew better." Now growing quite big children, would men women time; hoped would never thing wrong. (Their parents hoped same, doubted it.) In serious careful manner folded clothes, laid one one basket without mischief, until, two biggest boys lifting burden carry away, felt something tugging underneath. "Halloo! Where taking rubbish? Better give me." "No, please," said they, civilly, offend little brown man. "We will trouble you, thanks! We would rather ourselves; poor Gardener ill, his wife miserable, extremely sorry both." "Extremely sorry!" cried Brownie, throwing his cap air, tumbling head heels excited manner. "What world extremely sorry mean?" The children could explain, especially Brownie; thought understood--anyhow, felt it. And looked sorrowful Brownie could tell make it. He could said sorry, since, Brownie, human being, knowing right wrong, he never tried particularly right, idea he wrong. But he seemed idea he troubling children, he never liked see look unhappy. So he turned head heels six times running, came back again. "The silly old woman! I washed her clothes her last night way she did not expect. I had not soap, I used little mud coal-dust, pretty looked. Ha, ha, ha! Shall I wash to-night?" "Oh, no, please do not!" implored children. "Shall I starch iron them? I will beautifully. One--two--three, five--six--seven, Abracadabra, tum--tum--ti!" shouted he, jabbering sorts nonsense, seemed children, playing antics stood stared utmost amazement, quite forgot clothes. When looked round again, basket gone. "Seek till find, seek till find, Under biggest gooseberry-bush, exactly mind." They heard singing remarkable rhyme, long lost sight him. And set searching; long found, still longer could decide, biggest gooseberry-bush, child his her opinion--sometimes strong one--on matter. At last agreed settle pulling half-a-dozen little sticks, see stick longest, child held decide gooseberry-bush. This done, underneath branches find identical basket clothes! only, instead roughly dried, starched ironed beautiful manner. As shirts, really picture behold, stockings folded up, even darned one two places, neatly possible. And strange tell, single black mark feet fingers one them. "Kind little Brownie! clever little Brownie!" cried children chorus, thought astonishing trick he ever played. What Gardener's wife said it, whether told her thing, allowed her suppose clothes done laundry instead Brownie's (wherever establishment might be), I tell. Of one thing I certain--that little people said nothing true. Also, minute got home told mother every thing. But long time good deal troubled. Gardener got better, went hobbling place again, his every body's great content, his wife less sharp-tongued complaining usual--indeed, she nothing complain of. All family flourishing, except little Brownie. Often heard curious sound house; might rats squeaking behind wainscot--the elders said was--but children sure sort weeping wailing. "They have stolen coal, And I have not hole To hide in; Not even house One could ask mouse To bide in." A forlorn tune was, ending dreary minor key, lasted months months--at least children said did. And growing quite dull want playfellow, when, greatest good luck world, came house new lot kittens, new baby. And new baby everybody's pet, including Brownie's. From time, though he often seen, he continually heard staircase, he frequently mistaken Tiny cat, sent sharply again, wasting great deal wholesome anger upon Mr. Nobody. Or he lurked odd corners nursery, whither baby seen crawling eagerly nothing particular, sitting laughing her might something--probably her toes. But, Brownie never seen, he never suspected. And since he mischief--neither pinched baby broke toys, left soap bath footmarks room--but always well-conducted Brownie every way, he allowed inhabit nursery (or supposed so, since, nobody saw him, nobody could prevent him), children grown men women. After he retired his coal-cellar, and, I know, he may live still, gone hundreds adventures since; I never heard them, I cannot tell them. Only I think, I could little child again, I exceedingly like Brownie play me. Should you?
