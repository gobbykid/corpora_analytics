 A FLAT IRON FOR A FARTHING Some Passages Life Son A FLAT IRON FOR A FARTHING CHAPTER I MOTHERLESS When children clamour story, wife says me, "Tell bought flat iron farthing." Which I gladly do; three reasons. In first place, myself, I take interest it. Secondly, one dear me, appear hereafter. Thirdly, original story somewhat limited collection, I naturally rather proud favour invariably received. I think foolish fancy dear wife children combined veracious history committed paper. It either because--being unused authorship--I notion composition, troubled tyro tendency stray subject; part played flat iron, though important, small; I affairs chiefly interesting writer, family readers; combination reasons together, tale outgrew first title add second, call "Some Passages Life Son." Yes, I son. I child also, speaking world speaks, Wordsworth's "simple child" spoke. But let rather use "little maid's" reckoning, say I have, rather I had, sister. "Her grave green, may seen." She peeped world, called her Alice; she went away took mother her. It first great, bitter grief. I remember well day I led much mysterious solemnity see new sister. She week old. "You must quiet, sir," said Mrs. Bundle, new member establishment, "and account make noise disturb dear, pretty mamma." Repressed accumulation negatives, well size dignity Mrs. Bundle's outward woman, I went a-tiptoe her large shadow see new acquisition. Very young children always pretty, sister beautiful beyond will not babies. It old simile, she like beautiful painting cherub. Her little face wore expression seldom seen except faces lately come world, go it. The hair gilded pink head I allowed kiss one shade paler made great aureole pillow pale face "dear, pretty" mother. Years afterwards--in Belgium--I bought old medi√¶val painting Madonna. That Madonna stiffness, deadly pallor, thinness face incompatible strict beauty. But thin lips smile word lovely enough; eyes pure far-seeing look, hardly imagined except one painted (like Fra Angelico) upon his knees. The background (like many religious paintings date) gilt. With look smile mother's face shone mass her golden hair day she died. For I bought picture; I keep still. But go back. I liked Mrs. Bundle. I taken her evening she arrived red shawl, several bandboxes. My affection her established next day, she washed face dinner. My nurse bony, her hands knuckles, she washed face she scrubbed nursery floor Saturdays. Mrs. Bundle's plump palms like pincushions, she washed face baby's. On evening day I first saw Sister Alice, I took tea housekeeper's room. My nurse evening, Mrs. Cadman village party, neither cakes conversation flagged. Mrs. Cadman hollow eyes, (on occasion) hollow voice, impressive. She wore curl-papers continually, caused ask nurse she ever took out. "On Sundays she do," said Nurse. "She is religious then, I suppose," said I; I really think great compliment she paid first day week. I four years old time--an age one apt ask inconvenient questions make strange observations--when one struggling understand life mist novelties one, additional confusion falsehood common speak insinuate without scruple young children. The housekeeper Mrs. Cadman conversed time tea without diverting attention new box bricks Mrs. Bundle (commissioned father) brought town me; I put round arches pairs pillars, made successful "Tower Babel" cross layers bricks tapering towards top, I leisure look round listen. "I never know'd one look lived," Mrs. Cadman saying, her hollow tone. "It took notice first. Mark words, madam, sweeter child I never saw, it is _too_ good _too_ pretty long world." It difficult say exactly much one understands four years old, rather far one quite comprehends things one perceives part. I understood, felt, enough I heard, sympathetic sighs followed Mrs. Cadman's speech, make stumble Tower Babel, present Mrs. Cadman's knee question-- "Is mamma pretty good world, Mrs. Cadman?" I caught her elderly wink quickly housekeeper, directed. I completely deceived her answer. "Why, bless his dear heart, Master Reginald. Who he think I talking about, love?" "My new baby sister," said I, without hesitation. "No thing, lovey," said audacious Mrs. Cadman; "housekeeper talking Mrs. Jones's little boy." "Where Mrs. Jones live?" I asked. "In London town, dear." I sighed. I knew nothing London town, could prove Mrs. Jones existence. But I felt dimly dissatisfied, spite slice sponge-cake, put bed (for treat) papa's dressing-room. My sleep broken uneasy dreams, Mrs. Jones figured face Mrs. Cadman her hollow voice. I sensation night house never went rest. People came pretentious purpose awaking me. My father never came bed. I felt convinced I heard doctor's voice passage. At last, yet dark, I seemed sleeping waking, waking falling asleep crib weeks, father came strange look upon his face, took his arms, wrapped blanket round me, saying mamma wanted kiss me, I must good make noise. There little fear that! I gazed utter silence sweet face whiter sheet it, hair shone brighter ever candlelight. Only I kissed her, she laid her wan hand head, I whispered father, "Why mamma cold?" With smothered groan he carried back bed, I cried sleep. It true, then. She good pretty world, sunrise she gone. Before day ended Sister Alice left us also. She never knew harder resting-place mother's arms. CHAPTER II "THE LOOK"--RUBENS--MRS. BUNDLE AGAIN My widowed father I terribly lonely. The depths his loss lovely lovable wife his constant companion nearly six years I could fathom time. For part, I quite miserable I ever since, I doubt I shall ever feel overwhelming desolation again, unless sorrow befalls befell him. I "fretted"--as servants expressed it--to extent affect health; I fancy father's attention called fact I fast fading mother sister whose death (and loneliness) I bewailed, he roused his grief comfort mine. Once I "dressed" tea. Of late bony nurse thought necessary go ceremony, I crept crape-covered frock breakfast bedtime. Now I came dessert again, though I think empty place end table gave father fresh shock I took old post him, yet I fancy lonely evening less lonely presence. From his intense indulgence I think I dimly gathered he thought ill. I combined mind speech nurse's I overheard, gave horrors time--"He is got _the look_! It is his poor again!"--and I felt sort melancholy self-importance uncommon children health. I may say nurse quality common amongst uneducated people. She "sensational;" her custom going circumstances mother's death funeral (down price black paramatta her dress composed) her friends, she took walking, tended make happier cheerful. That night I ate father's plate I eaten weeks. As I lay dinner head upon his breast, he stroked curls tender touch seemed heal griefs, said, almost tone remorse, "What papa you, poor dear boy?" I looked quickly his face. "What would Regie like?" he persisted. I quite understood now, spoke boldly desires heart. "Please, papa, I like Mrs. Bundle nurse; I much want Rubens." "And Rubens?" asked father. "Oh, please, it is dog," I said. "It belongs Mr. Mackenzie school. And it is little dear, red white; licked face nurse I yesterday, I put hand mouth, rolled back, it is got long ears, followed way home, I gave piece bread, sit up, and"-- "But, little man," interrupted father--and he absolutely smiled catalogue marvels--"if Rubens belongs Mr. Mackenzie, wonderful fellow, I am afraid Mr. Mackenzie will not part him." "He would," I said, "but--" I paused, I feared barrier insurmountable. "But what?" said father. "He wants ten shillings him, Nurse says." "If that is all, Regie," said father, "you I go buy Rubens to-morrow morning." Rubens little red white spaniel much beauty sagacity. He prettiest, gentlest, winning playfellows. With side, I ran merrily about, instead creeping moodily heels nurse her friends. Abundantly occupied testing tricks he knew, teaching new ones, I less leisure listen open-mouthed cadaverous gossip Cadman class. Finally, I bidden good-night hundred times, absolutely fraternal embraces, I soothed light weight his head resting foot. He seemed chase hideous fancies hitherto passed nurse's daytime conversation trouble night visions, he would chase water-fowl reedy marsh, I slept--as he did--peacefully. Nor all. My wish also fulfilled, without vexations beforehand. It certain air tone nurse suddenly assumed towards me, difficult describe word "heighty-teighty," also dark hints changes she hoped (but seemed far believing) would good, finally, downright lamentations tragic inquiries she done parted her boy, "could her chickabiddy heart drive away his loving faithful nursey," I learned contemplated supersede her one else, she know I blame matter, she rate believed influence enough obtain reversal decree. That Mrs. Bundle her successor I gathered allusions "your great fat bouncing women would eat heads off; cleaning nursery--let see!" But her masterly stroke certain conversation Mrs. Cadman carried hearing. "Have ever notice, Mrs. Cadman," inquired bony nurse her less bony visitor--"Have ever notice stout people looks good-natured butter would not melt mouths wicked cruel underneath?" And followed series nurse's ghastly anecdotes, relative fat mothers ill-treated children, fat nurses nearly death unfortunate charges, fat female murderers, fat acquaintance her own, "taken" apoplexy fit rage her husband. "What warning! moral!" said Mrs. Cadman. She meant pious observation, I felt warning moral me. And even presence Rubens could dispel darkness dreams night. Alternately goaded caressed nurse, laid aside habit she beating tattoo her knuckles head I naughty, intense confusion irritation brain, I last resolved beg father let her remain us. I felt was--as she pointed out--intense ingratitude part wish part her, I said much I went dessert evening. Morever, I lived vague fear terrible qualities lay hidden beneath Mrs. Bundle's benevolent exterior. "If nurse teasing matter," said father, frown, "that would decide get rid her, I decided before. As liking Mrs. Bundle now--My dear little son, must learn know mind. You told wanted Mrs. Bundle--by good luck I able get hold her, she comes must make best her." She came next day, bony nurse departed. She wept indignantly, I wept remorsefully, waited terror manifestation Mrs. Bundle's cruel propensities. I waited vain. The reign Mrs. Bundle reign peace plenty, loving-kindness good things. Moreover reign wholesomeness, body mind. She give cheese beer her supper she good temper, pound unfortunate head her knuckles I displeased her. She strict maintenance certain old-fashioned nursery etiquette, obliged put away chair meals, fold clothes bedtime, put away toys I done them, say "please," "thank you," grace meals, prayers night morning, hymn bed, Church Catechism Sunday. She snubbed maids alluded presence things I could understand, she directed her conversation me, matters suitable age, instead talking childish head her gossips. The stories horror crime, fore-doomed babies, murders, mysterious whispered communications faded untroubled brain. Nurse Bundle's tales young masters misses she known. Her worst domestic tragedy boy broke his leg chair he failed put away breakfast. Her romances good old Nursery Legends Dick Whittington, Babes Wood, forth. My dreams became less like columns provincial newspaper. I imagined another Marquis Carabas, Rubens boots. I made desert island garden, lacked geography-book peculiarity "water round" it. I planted beans fond hope would tower skies take them. I became--in fancy--Lord Mayor London, Mrs. Bundle shared civic throne dignities, gave Rubens six beefeaters barge wait upon his pleasure. Life, short, utterly changed me. I grew strong, stout, well, happy. And I loved Nurse Bundle. CHAPTER III THE DARK LADY--TROUBLE IMPENDING--BEAUTIFUL, GOLDEN MAMMA So two years passed away. Nurse Bundle still me. With her I "did lessons" fashion. I learned read, I many Psalms good deal poetry--sacred secular--by heart. In old-fashioned, slow thorough manner, I acquired first outlines geography, arithmetic, etc., Mrs. Bundle taught I repeated Rubens. But I do not think he ever learned "capital towns Europe," though studied together oak tree. We happy two years together Bundle dynasty, trouble came. I never fond demonstrative affection strangers. The ladies lavish kisses flattery upon one's youthful head eating papa's good dinner--keeping sharp protective eye silk dresses, perchance pricking one brooch pushing curl one eye kid-gloved finger--I held unfeigned abhorrence. But natural instinct unloving fondling drawing-room visitors, I special peculiar antipathy Miss Eliza Burton. At first, I think I rather admired her. Her rolling eyes, black hair plastered low upon her forehead,--the colour high, never changeable delicate--the amplitude rustle her skirts, impressiveness her manner, her positive matureness, crude taste childhood apt fascinated by. She sister father's man business; she her brother visiting home. She really looked well morning, "toned down" fresh, summer muslin, womanly anxiety relieve father trouble making tea breakfast. "Dear Mr. Dacre, _do_ let relieve task," she cried, her ribbons fluttering sugar-basin. "I never like see gentleman sacrificing his guests breakfast. You enough dinner, carving large joints, jointing terrible birds. At breakfast gentleman trouble cracking his egg reading his newspaper. Now let me!" Miss Burton's long fingers almost tea-caddy; moment father quietly opened it, began measure tea. "I never trouble lady visitors this," he said, quietly. "I well accustomed it." Child I was, I felt well satisfied father would let one fill mother's place. For was, Miss Burton's efforts failed put her, even moment, head his table. I quite know I began realize her effort. I remember hearing scrap conversation respectable respectful butler housekeeper--"behind scenes"--as former worthy came breakfast-room. "And how is new missis morning, Mr. Smith?" asked housekeeper, bitterness softened prospect possible dethronement. "Another try tea-tray, madam," replied Smith, "but it is go." "A brazen, black-haired old maid!" cried housekeeper. "To think her taking place sweet angel, Mrs. Dacre (and she barely two years her grave), pretending act mother's part poor boy all. I have patience!" On one excuse another, Burtons contrived extend visit; prospect marriage father Miss Burton discussed openly behind his back fail hear it. Then Nurse Bundle subject hardly exercised her usual discretion withholding servants' gossip, servants' gossip me. Her indignation strongly aroused, I difficulty connecting her tearful embraces, her allusions dead mother, misfortune believed impending. [Illustration: The lank lawyer wagged hand morning, said, "And Miss Eliza's little beau?"] At first I admired Miss Burton's bouncing looks. Then head turned extent her flattery, establishment objectionable domestic jokes, parody love affairs connection children. Miss Burton called her little sweetheart, sent messages, vowed I quite little man world, sure I desperate flirt. The lank lawyer wagged hand morning, said, "And Miss Eliza's little beau?" And I laughed, looked important, talked rather louder, escaped often I could nursery, endeavoured act character assigned much grace √Üsop's donkey trying dance. I must become perfect nuisance sensible person period, indeed father interview Nurse Bundle subject. "Master Reginald seems troublesome he used be, nurse," said father. "Indeed say true, sir," said Mrs. Bundle, glad reply; "but it is drawing-room nursery it. Miss Burton always begging allowed stay nights lunch dining-room, come morning, half-holiday afternoon; and, saving better knowledge, sir, it is bad thing break regular ways children. It are not happiness, one else's." "You perfectly right, perfectly right," said father, "and shall occur again. Ah! poor boy," he added irrepressible outburst, "you suffer lack mother's care. I I can, man cannot supply woman's place child." Mrs. Bundle's feelings soliloquy may imagined. "You might knocked feather, sir," she assured butler (unlikely seemed!) describing scene afterwards. She found strength, however, reply father's remark. "Indeed, sir, mother's place never filled child one whatever. Least mother he dear lady. But he is boy, sir, girl, reason father he will chiefly look year two. And meanwhile, sir, I ask you, could Master Reginald look better behave better he afore company come? It is natural smart ladies knows nothing whatever children, brought up, what is good, think kindness spoil them. Any one may see lady notion children, would ruin Master Reginald she much him; company's gone, sir, he is left quiet his papa, you will find good young gentleman needs be, you will excuse freedom speaking, sir." Whatever father thought Mrs. Bundle's freedom speech, he said, "Master Reginald quite orders future, Nurse," dismissed her. And Mrs. Bundle "said her say," withdrew say confidence housekeeper. As me, vanity stronger good taste while, quickness childish instinct soon convinced Miss Burton real affection me. Then I puzzled her spasmodic attentions father room, her rough repulses I "bothered" her less appropriate moments. I got tired her, too, sound her voice, her black hair unchanging red cheeks. And day I caught her beating Rubens lying edge her dress, I lived terror her. Those rolling black eyes pleasant look lady temper. And she really new mistress house? To take place fair, gentle, beautiful mother? That wave household gossip ever surges behind master's back always breaking now, expressions pity motherless child "the dear lady dead gone." "I do not like black hair," I announced one day luncheon; "I like beautiful, shining, golden hair, like poor mamma's." "Do not talk nonsense, Reginald," said father, angrily, shortly afterwards I dismissed nursery. If I childish memory trust to, I think I could kept clear remembrance mother I had. But father's dressing-room hung water-colour sketch his young wife, me--her first baby--on her lap. It happy portrait. The little one nestled her arms, she herself looking bright smile happiness pride. That look came full spectator, perhaps lifelike I (ever since I could remember) indulged curious freak childish sentiment nodding picture saying, "Good-morning, mamma," whenever I came room. Such little superstitions become part one's life, I freely confess I salute portrait still! I remember, too, time went I lost sight fact I lay mother's lap, always regarded two Mamma Sister Alice--that ever-baby sister I kissed, more. I generally saw least day, privilege play father's dressing-room part his toilet, stereotyped joke us reference his shaving, always ended receiving piece creamy lather tip nose. But one evening shadow hanging household deepest upon me, I slipped unobserved drawing-room Miss Burton "performing" mother's piano, crept slowly sadly upstairs. I went slowly, partly heavy grief, partly I carried Rubens arms. Had lawyer kicked he lay upon pedal? I resolved insult he much trouble walking upstairs. So I carried him, I went I condoled him. "Did nasty man kick him? My poor Ru, darling, dear Ru! The pedal yours, his, whole house yours, his Miss Burton's; oh, I wish would go!" As I whined, Rubens whined; I kissed he licked me, result unfavourable balance, I obliged sit step. And I sat I wept, I wept overpowering mother-need came me, drives even little ragamuffin gutter carry his complaints "mother" comfort redress. And I took Rubens arms again, sobbing, saying, "I shall go Mamma!" weeping darkness crept dressing-room. I could see nothing, I knew well "Mamma" was, standing picture, I sobbed incoherent complaint. "Good-evening, Mamma! Good-evening, Sister Alice! Please, Mamma, it is Rubens." (Sobs part, frantic attempts Rubens lick every inch face once.) "And please, Mamma, we are miser-r-r-r-rable. And oh! please, Mamma, do not let papa marry Miss Burton. Please, please do not, dear, beautiful, golden Mamma! And oh! wish could come back! Rubens I." My voice died away wail dismally echoed Rubens. Then, suddenly, darkness came sob purely human, I clasped woman's arms, covered tender kisses soothing caresses. For one wild moment, excitement, boundless faith childhood, I thought mother heard me, come back. But Nurse Bundle. She putting away clothes father's bedroom, drawn dressing-room hearing voice. I think scene decided her take active steps. I feel convinced way her influence letter invitation despatched following day Aunt Maria. CHAPTER IV AUNT MARIA--THE ENEMY ROUTED--LONDON TOWN Aunt Maria father's sister. She married wealthy gentleman, large family children. It her originally got Nurse Bundle; anecdotes her cousins, wonderful accounts London (where lived), long figured conspicuously Mrs. Bundle's nursery chronicles. Aunt Maria came, Uncle Ascott came her. It altogether without reason I speak order. Aunt Maria active partner establishment. She clever, vigorous, well-educated, inartistic, kindly, managing woman. She exactly "meddling," she thought her duty interfere matter, delicacy scruples, nervousness baulked directness her proceedings. When she sweeping uncompromising, Uncle Ascott would say, "My dear Maria!" But generally spasm nervous cowardice, deliberate wish interrupt Aunt Maria's course action. He trusted her entirely. Aunt Maria shrewd, long interview Nurse Bundle her room hardly needed acquaint her condition domestic politics establishment. She "took in" Burtons one glance. The ladies "fell out" following evening. The Burtons left Dacrefield next morning, lunch Aunt Maria "pulled pieces" little remorse cook would pluck partridge. I never saw Miss Eliza Burton again. Aunt Maria fondle spoil me. She might perhaps shown tenderness her brother's motherless child; but, Miss Burton, fault right side. She kindly interest me, she showed asking pay her visit London. "It child good, Regie," she said father. "He children, London sights new him. I take every care him, must come fetch back. It good too." "To sure!" chimed Uncle Ascott, patting good-naturedly head; "Master Reginald fancy Fairy Land. There Zoological Gardens, Madame Tussaud's Waxwork Exhibition, Pantomime, one knows besides! We shall make quite home! He Helen age, I think, Polly's year younger, eh, mamma?" "Nineteen months," said Aunt Maria, decisively; she turned father, upon she urging certain particulars. It unfeigned joy I heard father say, "Well, thank you, Maria. I think good. And I will certainly come look Robert myself." There one drawback pleasure, much anticipated time first visit London came. Aunt Maria like dogs; Uncle Ascott said "they rural nice country, did not town house. Besides which, Regie," he added, "such pretty dog Rubens would sure stolen. And would not like that." "I take good care Rubens, boy," added father; promise I obliged content myself. The excitement pleasure various preparations visit treat. There domestic discussion suitable box clothes, matter quickly settled. There happened box exactly convenient size house, proposed pack things Nurse Bundle's one larger cases. This disappointment dignity; I ventured hint I "should like trunk myself, like grown-up gentleman," without, however, much hope wishes would fulfilled. The surprise pleasanter when, day departure, arrived carrier's cart nearest town small, daintily-finished trunk, lock key it, initials brass nails upon outside. It parting gift father. "I like young ladies gentlemen things nice  them," Nurse Bundle observed, prepared pack trunk. "Then takes pride things, stands reason takes care  them." To excellent sentiment I gave heartiest assent, proceeded illustrate fastidious care I selected folded clothes I wished take. As I examined socks signs wear tear, folded ingenious process grasping heels turning inside out, imitation Nurse Bundle, idea struck me, based upon late reading approaching prospects travel. "Nurse," said I, "I think I like learn darn socks, because, know, I might want know how, I cast away desert island." "If ever find desolate island, Master Reginald," said Nurse Bundle, "just write straight me, I will come kind things you." "Well," said I, "only mind bring Rubens, I have not got him." For I dim ideas Robinson Crusoe adventures might befall I returned home present expedition. My father's place sixty miles London. Mr. Mrs. Ascott come carriage, return way. I go them, Nurse Bundle also. She sit rumble carriage behind. Every particular new arrangement afforded great amusement; I could hardly control impatience eventful day arrive. It came last. There early breakfast us dining-room. No appetite, however, I; cruel I thought Aunt Maria insisting I swallow certain amount food, condition allowed go all. My enforced breakfast over, I went look Rubens. Ever since day first settled I go, dear dog kept close, close heels. That depressed aimless wandering always afflicts dogs household family going away home strong upon him. After new trunk came room, Rubens took his head fancy lying upon it; though brass nails must uncomfortable, though bed always free him, box he determined be, box he lay hours together. It box I found him, portico, despite cords added fresh discomfort his self-chosen resting-place. I called him, though he wagged his tail he seemed disinclined move, lay curled one eye shut one fixed carriage door. "He is trying get carriage, sir," said butler. "You want go too, poor Ruby, do not you?" I said; I went search meats console him. He accepted good breakfast hands gratitude, curled one eye watchful before. The reason his proceedings finally made evident his determined struggles accompany us last; till he forcibly shut coach-house able start. My grief parting lessened distraction another question. Of places equipage, I preferred riding postilion. Short that, I anxious sit behind rumble nurse. This favour length conceded, long farewell father, gilded sovereign pocket, I was, mountain wraps, consigned care Nurse Bundle back seat. The dew still ground, birds sang loudest, morning air fresh delicious, driven five miles way I could eaten three breakfasts one I rejected six of the clock. In first two villages drove people seemed getting beginning day's business. In one two "genteel" houses blinds still down; reference I resolved _I_ grew I would waste best part day bed, sun shining, birds singing, flowers opening, country people going business, beyond closed windows. "Nurse, please, I like always breakfast six of the clock. Do hear, Nursey?" I added, Mrs. Bundle feigned absorbed contemplating flock sheep driven past us. "Very well, dear. We will see." That "we will see" Nurse Bundle's sort moral soothing-syrup she kept allay inconvenient curiosity over-pertinacious projects nursery. I soon reason decide I breakfast six, luncheon would unacceptable half-past ten, time I lost sight scenery confined attention worsted workbag Nurse Bundle store acceptable buns. Halting shortly water horses, glass milk got wayside inn, door hung small gate, whose bars following legend painted:-- "This gate hangs well And hinders none. Refresh pay, And travel on." "Did put up?" I inquired man brought milk. "No, sir. It is long enough," his reply. "What 'hinders none' mean?" I asked. The man looked back, considered question. "It means it is way nothing. It do not hinder nobody," he replied last. "It could not wanted to," said I; "for does not reach across road. If did, I suppose would tollbar." "He is rum little chap, that!" said waiter Nurse Bundle, he taken back empty glass. And he unmistakably nodded me. "What rum little chap, Nurse?" I inquired fairly started more. "It is low language," said Mrs. Bundle, indignantly; fact depressed several miles. At half-past eleven rattled Farnham, stopped lunch "The Bush." I delighted get perch, stretch cramped legs running charming garden behind celebrated inn. Dim bright memories still long-windowed parlour opening garden verdant grass, stately yew hedges, formal clipped trees; gay, too, bright flowers, mysterious walk winding arch yew hedge distant bowling-green. On one side arch admirably-carved stone figure broadcoat ruffles played perpetually upon stone fiddle equally spirited shepherdess hoop high heels, ever posed dancing posture upon her pedestal never danced away. As I wandered round garden whilst luncheon prepared, I greatly taken figures, wondered might enchanted prince princess turned stone wicked witch, envious happiness peaceful garden amid green alleys fragrant flowers. As I ate luncheon I felt I consuming property, pondered supposition day spell might broken, stone-bound couple came high pedestals, go dancing fiddling Farnham streets. They showed symptoms moving whilst remained, and, duly refreshed, proceeded way. I rejected offer seat inside carriage scorn, Nurse I clambered back perch. No easy matter either us, way!--Nurse Bundle much large, I much small, compass feat anything approaching ease. I greatly pleased dreary beauties Bagshot Heath, Nurse Bundle (to whole journey familiar) enlivened part way anecdotes Dick Turpin, celebrated highwayman, she deemed suitable amusement. With interest I gazed little house roadside Turpin will not lodge, where, arriving late one night, he demanded beef-steak supper terms peremptory that, none house, old woman acted his housekeeper obliged walk, there, nearest town procure it! This various incidents robber's career I learned Nurse Bundle, told traditions his exploits character still fresh neighbouring villages. At Virginia Water dined changed horses. We stayed longer necessary, I might see lake ship; Uncle Ascott gave sixpence old man wooden leg told us it. And still I declined inside place, went back Nurse Bundle rumble. Early rising long drive began make sleepy. The tame beauties valley Thames drew little attention weary eyes; I remember much place next halted, except tea tasted hay, bread butter good. I gazed dreamily Hounslow, despite fresh tales Dick Turpin; successive "jogs" Nurse called incapable attention lamplighters, shops, bottles chemists' windows, Hyde Park, failed rouse intelligent appreciation great city, I reached it. After long weary dream rattle bustle, dim lamps, houses stretching upwards like Jack's beanstalk chilly foggy darkness, carriage stopped one final jolt quiet partially-lighted square; I lifted down, staggered house light abundant overpowering feeble inefficient without, and, cramped limbs, smothered shawls, I could beg utter weariness put bed. Aunt Maria always sensible, generally kind. "Bring his room, Mrs. Bundle," she said, "and get his clothes off, I bring hot wine water rusks." As dream, I undressed, face hands washed, prayers said somewhat perfunctory fashion, evening hymn commuted consideration fatigues beautiful verse, "I lay peace, take rest," etc.; time I sank luxuriously clean sheets, I almost sufficiently restored appreciate dainty appearance room. Then Aunt Maria brought hot wine water flavoured sleep-giving cloves, Nurse folded clothes, tucked up, left me, friendly reflection lamps without keep company. I think I really sleep, I believe I dozing, I fancied I heard familiar sound Rubens lapping water toilette jug room home. Just conscious I there, Rubens could here, sound began trouble me. At first I sleepy care look round. Then I became awake sound less distinct, I felt fidgety frightened, last called faintly Nurse Bundle. Then sound stopped. I could hardly breathe, resolved upon making brave sally assistance, when--plump! _something_ alighted bed, and, wildly impossible seemed, Rubens waggled pillow, began licking face his life depended laying nose projecting parts countenance flat cheeks. How he got London never knew. As he made easy escape coach-house Dacrefield, always supposed he simply followed carriage, wit hide stopped road. He terribly tired. He might well thirsty! I levied large contributions box rusks Aunt Maria left bedside, his benefit, he supped well. Then he curled his proper place feet. He intensely self-satisfied, expressed his high idea his exploit self-gratulatory "grumphs," describing many mystic circles, scraping fair Marseilles quilt plan his own, he brought his nose tail together satisfactory position his nest, passed first night London dreamless profound sleep. CHAPTER V MY COUSINS--MISS BLOMFIELD--THE BOY IN BLACK My first letter father work several days, penmanship rapid order, cost good deal trouble. When finished ran thus: MY DEAR PAPA, I hope quite well. quite well. Rubens he quite well. We do not he got verry glad. Ant Maria said well he cannot sent back he sleeps bed like London kweer place houses big like cussens pretty well gals nozes big like Polly. Nurse quite well good-bye. loving son, REGINALD DACRE. Though I cannot defend spelling document, I must say leave much added portrait cousins. But polite introduce separately, presented me. I heard them, bye, I saw them. It whilst I dressing, morning arrival, I heard sounds room below, interpreted Nurse "Miss Maria her music." The peculiarity Miss Maria's music scramble notes, suggestive one running get impetus jump, ear waited impatiently consummation, Miss Maria baulked her leap, speak, got farther, began scramble again, stuck more, on. And as, whilst finding running passage quite much one hand, she struggled different phrase hand time, instead practising two hands separately, her chances final success seemed remote indeed. Then I heard performance peculiar circumstances. Nurse Bundle opened window, two minutes cousin commenced her practice, organ-grinder street began his. The subject poor Maria's piece knew completion, she stuck halfway; organ-grinder's melodies stopped touch mechanism, Black-Eyed Susan passed Old Hundredth, awkwardly, hardly perceptible pause. The effect joint performance first ludicrous, degrees maddening, especially come Old Hundredth, familiar connection words Psalm. "Three four and--" began poor Maria afresh, desperate resolution; she went key-board; "one two three four and, one two three four and--" "--joy--His--courts--un--to," ground organ inevitable pause. And cousin took courage made another start--"Three four one two and," etc.; old place nasal notes instrument evoked "al--ways," memory; Maria pausing despair, Old Hundredth finished triumphantly, "For--it--is--seemly--so--to--do." At half-past eight Maria stopped abruptly middle her run, Nurse took school-room breakfast. The school-room high narrow, old carpet, old piano, books, two globes, good deal feminine rubbish way old work-baskets, unfinished sewing, etc. There two long windows, lower halves covered paint. This mattered less view backyards, roofs, chimneys. Living I did, much alone father, I first oppressed number petticoats room--five girls ages ranging twelve six, grown-up lady spare brown stuff dress spectacles. As entered she came quickly forward shook Nurse hand. "How do, Mrs. Bundle? Very glad see again, Mrs. Bundle." Nurse Bundle shook hands first, curtsied afterwards. "I am well, thank you, madam, hope you are same. Master Reginald Dacre, madam. This lady Miss Blomfield, Master Reginald; I hope you will behave properly, give lady trouble." "I am governess, dear," said Miss Blomfield, emphatically. (She always "made point" announcing her dependent position strangers. "It best avoid awkwardness," she will not say; I saw glances smiles exchanged occasion girls.) Miss Blomfield kind me. Indeed she kind every one. Her peculiarities conscientiousness fidgets, tendencies fine crochet, calomel, Calvinism, abiding quality harassing harassed, I may say is, I convinced, common unfortunate atmosphere much process education girls upper middle classes England. At moment aunt came in. "Good morning, Miss Blomfield." "Good morning, Mrs. Ascott," governess hastily interposed. "I hope you are well morning." "Good morning, girls. Good morning, Nurse. How you, Regie? All right morning? Bless me, there is dog! What extraordinary affair is! Mr. Ascott says he shall send 'Gentleman's Magazine.' Well, he cannot sent back now, I suppose he will stop. And must keep mischief, Regie. Remember, he is come drawing-room. Mrs. Bundle, see that? Miss Blomfield, kindly speak Signor Rigi he comes to-morrow--" "Certainly, Mrs. Ascott," interposed governess. "--about piece Maria's? She does not seem get bit." "No, Mrs. Ascott." "And I am sure she is practising long time." "Yes, Mrs. Ascott." "Mr. Ascott says makes his hand quite unsteady he is shaving morning, hear her always break one place." The lines harass Miss Blomfield's countenance deepened visibly, her crochet-needle trembled her hand, whilst despondent stolidity settled Maria's face. "Certainly, Mrs. Ascott. I am glad you have spoken. Thank mentioning it, Mrs. Ascott. It distressed greatly, great trouble mind time. I spoke seriously Maria last Sabbath subject" (symptoms sniffling poor Maria's part). "I believe she wishes her duty, I may say I anxious mine, position. Of course, Mrs. Ascott, I know you have right expect improvement, I shall happy rise half hour earlier, give her longer practice young ladies, consider duty governess, Mrs. Ascott. I have felt great trouble, I cannot imagine Maria improve her music Jane does, I give equal attention exactly; makes singular still Maria good her sums--I fault find whatever. But I regret say case Jane. I told her Wednesday I wish make complaint; I feel duty, Mrs. Ascott, let know her marks arithmetic right expect." Here Miss Blomfield paused wiped her eyes. Not she weeping, her short-sightedness she troubled dimness vision, afflicted her times others. As she habit endeavouring counteract evils constantly laborious sedentary life, anxious desponding temperament, large doses calomel, her malady increased painfully rapid strides. On particular morning she busy since five of the clock, neither she girls (who rose six) anything eat, somewhat faint want breakfast cooling table. Meanwhile "humming head," _she_ subject, rendered Maria mercifully indifferent proposal add extra half-hour her distasteful labours; Miss Blomfield corrugated her eyebrows, conscientiously distressed really puzzled Mother Nature give different gifts her children, mother teachers according flesh particular afford equality "advantages." "Signor Rigi told Maria got good ear Jane," said Mrs. Ascott. "However, perhaps well let Maria practise half hour, Jane half hour her arithmetic Saturday afternoons." "Certainly, Mrs. Ascott." "And now," said aunt, "I must introduce girls Reginald. This Maria, eldest cousin, nearly double age, she twelve. This Jane, two years younger. This Helen; she nine, tall Jane, see. This Harriet, eight. And Mary--Polly, papa calls her--and she nineteen months younger you, terrible tomboy already; do not make her worse. This cousin, girls, Reginald Dacre. You must amuse among you, do not tease him, he used children." We "shook hands" round, I liked Polly's hand best. It least froggy, cold, spiritless. Then Mrs. Ascott departed, Maria (overpowered humming) "flopped" her chair fashion would certainly drawn rebuke Miss Blomfield access eye-dimness carried her her seat little grace. Uncle Ascott large nose, cousins image other. They plain, lady-like, rather bouncing girls, aquiline noses, voices family _twang_ slightly nasal, long feet terribly given chilblains, long fingers, turns practised exercises old piano successive mornings breakfast. When became intimate, I used keep watch clock benefit one practising. At half-past eight she released, shutting book bang would scamper off, summer stretch herself, winter warm her hands toes. I used watch fingers childish awe, wondering thin pieces flesh bone hit hard blows notes without cracking, also somewhat puzzled run good luck seemed direct weak random-looking skips jumps keys aimed. I seen tears "music," called, generally persevering, winter (so I afterwards discovered) invariably blue. It till finished breakfast Miss Blomfield became fairly conscious presence Rubens, she her alarm great. Considering she suffered her proper peculiar worries, seemed melancholy add her burdens hourly expectation outbreak hydrophobia. In vain I testified sweetness Rubens' temper. It undeniable dogs sometimes bite least expect it, bites end hydrophobia; long Miss Blomfield became reconciled new inmate school-room. The girls, contrary, delighted dog; ground became friendly. My particular affection Polly also probably due discovery incomparably stolid expression countenance she passing highly buttered pieces bread table Rubens breakfast. Polly chief companion. The girls good-natured, constantly occupied school-room, hours nominally "lesson time" given preparing tasks next day. By great unusual concession, Polly's lessons shortened she might bear company. For day two decided I lonely, Cousin Polly's holiday brought much satisfaction her; filled poor Miss Blomfield's mind disquietude, scruples, misgivings. In middle square uncle aunt lived garden, trees, grass, gravel-walks; Polly I played hide seek, ran races, chased Rubens. The garden free dwellers square, several children besides will not play there. One day I strolling about, little boy I seen came walk crossed grass. He seemed year two older myself, caught eye immediately his remarkable beauty, depth mourning he wore. His features exquisitely cut, and, child, one disposed complain effeminacy. His long fair hair combed--in royal fashion--down his back, style time unusual; his tightly-fitting jacket breeches black, bordered deep crape; even white collar relieved his sombre attire, his fair face shone doubly fair contrast. "Polly! Polly!" I cried, running find companion guide, "who beautiful boy black?" "That is little Sir Lionel Damer," said Polly. "Good-morning, Leo!" she nodded he passed. The boy touched his hat, bent his head melancholy yet half-comical dignity, walked on. "Who is he mourning for?" I asked. "His father mother," said Polly. "They drowned together, he Sir Lionel." I looked sudden intense sympathy. His mother his father too! This indeed sorrow deeper mine. Surely his mother, like mine, must fair beautiful, much beauty fairness descended him. "Has he sisters, Polly?" I asked. Polly shook her head. "I do not think he anybody," said she. Then he also son! CHAPTER VI THE LITTLE BARONET--DOLLS--CINDER PARCELS--THE OLD GENTLEMAN NEXT DOOR--THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS The next time I saw Sir Lionel two days afterwards, afternoon, elder girls gone drive carriage Aunt Maria, others, myself, playing garden; Miss Blomfield seated camp-stool reading terrible article "Rabies" Medical Dictionary. Rubens I strolled away rest, I exercising his tricks little baronet passed us his accustomed air mingled melancholy, dignity, self-consciousness. I good deal fascinated him. Beauty strong attraction children, depth his weeds invested melancholy interest, also great charms young. Then, crown all, he mourned loss young mother--and I. I involuntarily showed Rubens he approached, he lingered watched us. By sort impulse I took little hat, I taught strangers. He lifted his dismal grace moved on. But he walked I could see he kept looking Rubens I played upon grass, last he came sat near us. "Is dog?" he asked. "Yes he is dog," I answered. "He seems clever," said Sir Lionel. "Did teach tricks yourself?" "Very nearly all," said I. "Rubens, shake hands Sir Lionel." "How know name?" he asked. "Polly told me," said I. "Do know Polly?" Sir Lionel inquired. I stared, forgetting course he know I was, answered-- "She is cousin." "What is name?" he asked. I told him. "Do like Polly?" he continued. "Very much," I said, warmly. It ludicrous imitation grown-up person's manner he added, perfect gravity-- "I hope love her?" "Oh, dear no!" I cried, hastily, I enough joke Miss Eliza Burton. "Then right," said little baronet; "let us friends." And friends became. "Call Leo, I will call Reginald," said little gentleman; was. I think justice I say this, first friendship, I faithful devoted. Leo, his part, always affectionate, he admiration Rubens went long way Rubens' master. But he little spoiled capricious, and, like many people rather small capacities (whether young old), he often unintentionally inconsiderate. In days affection waited willingly upon his; I know quiet amiable way he selfish. I blessed easy temper, time ample opportunities accommodating whims friend Leo cousin Polly. Not Polly like Sir Lionel way whatever. But she quick-tempered resolute. She much clever her age I mine. She decided rapid her views proceedings, generous affectionate also, selfish. But her qualities Leo came thing far I concerned. I invariably yielded both. Between themselves, I may say, squabbled systematically, never either friends enemies two days together. Polly I never quarrelled. I her behests manfully, general rule; her sway became intolerable, I complained bewailed, she relented, easily moved pity wrath. As weather grew chill, seldom went except morning. In afternoon Polly I (sometimes accompanied Leo) played nursery top house. Now girls would come up, "play dolls" Polly. On occasions treatment I experienced certainly hard. They soon absorbed dressing undressing, sham meals, sham lessons, domestic romance doll-life, which, according poor abilities, I happy taken part. But, unwarrantable assumption "boys could play dolls," part assigned puppet comedy take dolls' dirty clothes imaginary wash miniature wheelbarrow. I time assume character dolls' medical man considerable success; vaccinated kid arm one patients deeply certain occasion big pin, she suffered severely loss bran I voted practitioner old school, dismissed. I need hardly say harsh decision proved ruin professional prospects, I sent back wheelbarrow. It tired ordinary amusements, week wet weather, Polly I devised new piece fun enliven monotony hours shut town nursery top house. Outside nursery-windows iron bars--a sensible precaution Aunt Maria accidents "the little ones." One day window slightly open, Polly I hanging window-ledge, attitudes fully justified precautionary measure grating, bit paper rolled Polly's hand escaped her grasp, floated street. In moment Polly I standing window-ledge, peering down--to best ability--into square area depths below. Like snow-flake summer, saw paper-twist lying pavement; delight rose ecstasy portly passer-by stooped picked document carefully examined it. Out incident arose systematic amusement, which, advance age, called "the parcel post." By shoving aside fire-guard absence nurses, obtained cinders, repaired post window, thus illustrating natural proclivity children places danger bane parents guardians. Here fastened little fragments cinder pieces writing-paper, secured tidily string, dropped parcels iron bars post-office. It breathless moment fell space like shooting stars. It triumph cleared area. But aim end labours see one missives attract notice passer-by, excite his curiosity, finally--if he opened it--rouse his unspeakable disgust disappointment. Like tricksters, game lasted long ever-green credulity "public." In ever-fresh stream human life daily flowed beneath windows, sure one pedestrians who, varying expressions conscientious responsibility, unprincipled appropriation, mere curiosity, would open parcels, either ascertain trinket restored owner, keep got, see seen. One day dropped one parcels feet lady going by, she nonplussed us effectually ringing bell handing footman "something accidentally dropped one upper windows." Fortunately us parcel reach Aunt Maria; Polly intercepted it. As passers-by never wearied parcels, I know got tired share fun, occurrence brought amusement suddenly end. One afternoon made neatest little white-paper parcels, worthy come jeweller's, I clambered window-seat I might drop successfully (and quite clear area) street. Just I dropped it, passed elderly gentleman precisely dressed, gold-headed cane, well-brushed hat. Pop! I let cinder parcel fall his beaver, rebounded his feet. The old gentleman looked quickly up, eyes met, I felt convinced he saw I thrown it. I called Polly, she reached side old gentleman untied examined parcel. When he came cinder, he looked more, Polly jumped window prolonged "Oh!" "What is matter?" I asked. "Oh, dear!" cried Polly; "it is old gentleman next door!" For several days lived unenviable suspense. Every morning expect summoned school-room scolded Aunt Maria. Every afternoon dreaded arrival "the old gentleman next door" make his formal complaint, and, whenever front-door bell rang, Polly I literally "shook shoes." But several days passed, heard nothing it. We given practice fright, thoughts beginning again, harm come us. One evening (by odd coincidence, birthday morrow) Polly I putting away playthings preparatory dressed go dessert, large brown-paper parcel brought nursery addressed jointly cousin. "It is birthday present you, Regie!" Polly cried. "But there is name it, Polly," said I. "It must mistake," said Polly. But she looked much pleased, nevertheless; so, I doubt, I. We cut string, tore first thick covering. The present, whatever might be, securely wrapped second time finer brown paper carefully tied. "It is _very_ carefully done up," said I, cutting second string. "It must something nice," said Polly, decisively; "that is it is taken care of." If Polly's reasoning just, must something nice indeed, second wrapper third, third fourth, fourth fifth, fifth sixth, sixth seventh. We point giving despair came box. With difficulty got lid open, took one two folds paper. Then lot soft shavings, brittle toys gimcracks often packed in, among shavings was--a small neatly-folded white-paper parcel. _And inside parcel cinder._ We certainly looked foolish stood present. I think people taken looked thoroughly completely so. We eve crying, ended laughing. Then Polly--in trenchant tones recalled Aunt Maria forcibly one's mind--said, "Well! quite deserve it." The "parcel-post" discontinued. We doubt played us trick. It old gentleman next door. He wealthy, benevolent, rather eccentric old bachelor. It his custom take early walk good his health garden square, he sometimes took evening stroll place pleasure. Somehow he made speaking acquaintance Miss Blomfield, afterwards discovered he made needful inquiries names, etc., Polly her--she, however, quite innocent drift his questions. I certainly selected old gentleman's hat drop best parcel to, I known he was. I likely forget his face now. I soon got know neighbours sight. On one side us old gentleman, whose name Bartram; side lived Sir Lionel Damer. He staying his guardian, old Colonel Sinclair; father came town he Colonel Sinclair discovered old school-fellows, Leo I looked upon good omen friendship. Polly I Nurse Bundle became learned gossip one else lives town, constantly looking window. We knew (bird's-eye) appearance everybody side square, servants, cats dogs, carriages, even tradesmen. If one neighbours changed his milkman, came much new muffin man square, agog. One day I saw Polly upon perch, struggling get her face close glass, much hindered size her nose. I felt sure _something_ below--at least new butcher's boy. So I surprised she called "come look." "Who it?" said Polly. "I do not know," said I. And stared on, downright hard looking could discover name gentleman come steps Colonel Sinclair's house. He short slight man, young, sandy hair. Neither us seen before. Having good fortune see return Colonel Sinclair's house, two hours later, I hurried news Polly; resolved get see Leo soon possible, satisfy curiosity respecting stranger. So afternoon sent message invite come play us square, received answer "Sir Lionel engaged." Later he came square, stranger him. Polly I Rubens together seat; Leo saw us he gave scanty nod went opposite direction, leaning arm stranger apparently absorbed talking him. I rather hurt his neglect us. But Polly said positively, "That Leo's way. He likes new friends. But he treats like that, I speak week afterwards." That evening cab carried stranger, next day Leo came us square, smiles friendliness. "I have wanting see you!" he cried, devoted tones. But Polly took her doll, her impressive nose air, walked house. I could quarrel Leo myself, soon friendly ever. "I want tell news, Regie," he said. "Colonel Sinclair decided I tutor." "Are glad?" I asked. "Yes, very," said Sir Lionel. "You see I like much--I mean tutor. He yesterday. You saw me. He going clergyman. He Cambridge, he plays flute." For long time Leo enlarged upon merits his tutor be; I went back Polly news I impart served atone joined her snubbing capricious Sir Lionel. As him, he restless Polly's displeasure, finally apologized, Polly gave sound scolding, which, surprise, he took utmost good part, best possible friends. That visit London era life. It certainly enjoyable, world good, body mind. When father came up, enjoyed still more. He coaxed holidays girls even Aunt Maria, took us (Leo all) places amusement. With went Zoological Gardens. The monkeys attracted indescribably, I seriously proposed father adopt one two brothers me. I felt convinced properly dressed taught would quite companionable, I said so, father's great amusement, scandal Nurse Bundle, us. "I fear would never teach talk, Regie," said father; "and friend could neither speak understand spoke would poor companion, even he could dance top barrel-organ crack hard nuts." "But, papa, babies cannot talk first," said I; "they taught." Now good luck argument stood near us country woman child her arms she holding biscuit, repeating she so, "Ta!" expectant tone supposed encourage childish efforts pronounce abbreviated form thanks. "Now look, papa!" I cried, "that is way I teach monkey. If I hold bit cake him, say, 'Ta,'"--(and I spoke I highly intelligent little gentleman sat close bars cage his eyes face, he well aware question deep importance discussed)-- "He would probably snatch hand without ceremony," said father. And, dashing his skinny fingers bars, was, I regret say, precisely little gentleman did. I quite taken aback; turned round, infinite delight, undutiful baby snatched biscuit mother's hand fashion remarkably similar burst laughing, I shouted triumph, "Now, papa! children too." "Well, Regie," he answered, "I think made good case. But question remains is, whether Mrs. Bundle young friends nursery." But Mrs. Bundle's horror remarks great admit her even entering joke. The monkeys somewhat driven mind wit wisdom elephant, condescension displayed large animal accepting light refreshment penny buns. After he several, Leo began tease him, holding bun snatching away again. As he holding fourth fifth time, elephant extended his trunk usual, instead directing towards bun, he deliberately snatched black velvet cap Leo's head swallowed grunt displeasure. Leo first frightened, good deal annoyed universal roar laughter his misfortune occasioned. But he good-tempered boy, soon joined laugh himself. Then, could buy new cap Gardens, he obliged walk rest time bare-headed; many people turned round look second time beautiful boy long fair hair--a fact Master Lionel quite unconscious, I think. My aunt kindly pressed us remain her Christmas. I longed see pantomime, heard much cousins Leo delights--and harlequin, columbine, clown. But father wanted home again, he took Rubens Nurse Bundle end November. CHAPTER VII POLLY AND I RESOLVE TO BE "VERY RELIGIOUS"--DR. PEPJOHN--THE ALMS-BOX--THE BLIND BEGGAR I must forget speak incident considerable influence character time. The church uncle his family "attended," called, one dreary places worship common time, London elsewhere. It ugly outside, outside ugliness nothing compared ugliness within. The windows long bluntly rounded top, sunlight modified scanty calico blinds, which, yellow age smoke, _toned_ light rather agreeable manner. Mouldings pattern one sees common fireplaces ran everywhere praiseworthy impartiality. But great principle ornamental work throughout principle prevalent date particular church last "done up." It imitations things really there, would quite place there. For instance, pillars looped-up curtains painted flat walls, pretentious shadows, reference real direction light. At east end Hebrew letters, executed journeymen painters usually execute them, less cheerful look highly-coloured lion unicorn gallery front. The clerk's box, reading-desk, pulpit, piled one another, symmetrical effect, umbrella-shaped sounding-board gave distant resemblance Chinese pagoda. The things gave warmth colour interior whole cushions pew curtains. There plenty them, mostly red. These curtains added sense isolation, already sufficiently attained height pew walls doors bolts. I think this--and fact that, congregation took outward part prayers except listening them, Polly I nothing do--and could even hear old gentleman usually "read prayers"--which led us reprehensible habit "playing houses" Uncle Ascott's gorgeously furnished pew. Not left tightly stuffed seats one moment, sat stood, unable see anything beyond bombazine curtains (which, intervening us distant parson, made hearing he said next impossible), amused mentally "pretending" good deal domestic drama, pew represented house; related respective "plays" afterwards went home. Wrong was, intend irreverent, though I grace feel slightly shocked cheerfully lighted evening service, claims missionary society enforced, Polly confided me, triumph her tone, "I pretended theatre, man going round box upstairs, I pretended oranges gallery." I felt uneasy proceedings, I told Polly I thought right, ought "try attend." I rather expected her resent advice, she said she "sometimes thought wrong" herself; resolved behave better future, indeed really give unseasonable game. Few religious experiences fill one shame self-reproach large results small efforts right direction. Polly I prospered efforts "attend." I may say that, child I was, I began find satisfaction pleasure going church, though place hideous, ritual dreary, minister mumbling. When chance nice hymn, as, "Glory Thee," "O GOD, help ages past," quite happy. We also tried manfully "attend" sermons, which, considering length abstruseness them, was, I think, creditable us. I fear felt so, time began proud texts knew, punctilious propriety family pew, resolve taken accordance proposal Polly-- "Let us religious." One Saturday Miss Blomfield good deal excited certain clergyman preach church next Sunday, services matter interest us, Polly I excited too. I troubled toothache week, better, I quite able go church rest family. The general drift sermon, even text, long since faded mind; I remember contained highly coloured peroration Day Judgment terrors Hell, horror distress knew bounds; sermon ended, began sing, "From lowest depths woe," I burst passion weeping. The remarkable part incident that, rest party sat noses air quite undistressed terrible eloquence preacher, Aunt Maria never moment guessed real tears. But soon carriage (it rainy evening, driven church), she said-- "That poor child never minute's peace tooth's his head. Thomas! Drive Dr. Pepjohn's." Polly say, "Is bad, Regie?" But Aunt Maria answered me--"Cannot see it is bad, child? Leave alone." I ashamed confess real outburst, suffered disingenuousness Dr. Pepjohn's consulting-room. "Show Dr. Pepjohn is, Regie," said aunt; and, tears become simply hysterical, I pointed tooth ached. "Just allow touch it," said Dr. Pepjohn, inserting his fat finger thumb mouth. "I will not hurt you, little man," he added, affable mendaciousness his craft. Fortunately rather loose, couple hard wrenches doctor's expert fingers brought out. "You think cruel, now, do not you, little man?" said jocose gentleman, taking leave. "I do not think you are cruel," I answered, candidly; "but I think tell fibs, _did_ hurt." The doctor laughed long loudly, said I quite original, puzzled extremely. Then he gave sixpence, I much pleased, parted good friends. My father us following Sunday, he go church Aunt Maria went to. I went one he went. This church well built appropriately decorated. The music good, responses congregation hearty, service altogether much better adapted awaken sustain interest child I hitherto London. "You know _couldn't_ play houses church Papa goes," I told Polly return, I anxious she go us evening service. She go, I bound confess she decided loyal preference service she accustomed, and, like sensible people, agreed differ tastes. "There is clerk church, know," said Polly, gap threefold ministry clerk, reader, preacher, symbolized "three-decker" pulpit, ill atoned chanting choir. In quite different way, I much impressed sermons new church I cost tooth. One sermon especially upon duties visiting sick imprisoned, feeding hungry, clothing naked, made impression years efface. I made earnest resolutions active deeds kindness "when I man," and, troubled considerations political economy, I began charitable career dividing pocket money I hand amongst street-sweepers mendicants nearest square. I soon converted Polly way thinking; put money-box nursery, imitation alms-box church. I ashamed confess I guilty meanness changing sixpence I dedicated "charity-box" twelve half-pence, I might satisfaction making dozen distinct contributions fund. But, despite follies, vanities, imperfections (and human efforts good stained folly, vanity, imperfection?), benevolence without sincerity self-denial, brought invariable reward increased willingness more; according deep wisdom poet-- "In knowledge won: To see yet remains undone." We really forego many toy treat add charitable store; I began habit taxing money I possessed, taking fixed proportion "charity," I never discontinued, advantages I heartily testify. When self-indulgent civilization goads classes live beyond incomes, tempts include duty almsgiving expenditure incomes, well remove due proportion one beyond reach ever-growing monster extravagance; and, decided upon unbiased calm moment, less likely much one's domestic claims, little one's religious duty. It frees one ever grudging often comical spasm meanness attacks many even wealthy people asked give, because, among large "expenses" goods willingly made liable, expense giving alms goods never fairly counted item less needful, less imperative, less felt deduction remainder, less life-long daily, expenses rent, dress, dinner-parties. We had, I say, knowledge political economy, must confessed objects charity one occasion unworthy. "Oh, Regie, dear," Polly cried one day, rushing she returned walk (I cold, nursery), "there poor, poor man corner ---- Street. I think ought give that is left box. He is quite blind, he reads book queer letters. It is one Gospels, he says; he must good, he reads day long. And he cannot home, he sits street. And he is got ticket his back say 'Blind,' 'Taught Blind School.' And I passed he reading quite loud. And I heard say, 'Now Barabbas robber.' Oh, he _is_ poor man! And know, Regie, he _must_ good, _we_ do not sit reading Bibles day long." I gave consent box emptied favour poor pious man; first opportunity Polly took money her _prot√©g√©_. "He much pleased!" she reported her return. "He seemed quite surprised get much. And he said, 'GOD bless you, miss!' I wish you would there, Regie. I said, 'It is me.' He _was_ much pleased!" "How he know _miss_, I wonder?" said I. "I suppose voice," said Polly, pause. As soon I could go out, I went see blind man. As I drew near, he was--as Polly told me--reading aloud. The regularity rapidity his fingers ran line line, he rubbing something slate, striking; I stood beside I distinctly heard read verse, "Now Barabbas robber." It startling coincidence find still reading words Polly overheard, especially way remarkably adapted subject prolonged meditation. Much living alone grown-up people had, I think, helped towards acquiring habit I "brown studying," turning things over, brewing them, speak, mind. I stood pondering peculiarities object charity moments, he elaborately occupied turning leaf his book. Presently I said-- "What makes say loud read?" He turned his head towards me, blinking rolling his eyes, replied impressive tones-- "It is pleasure I takes it, sir." Now he blinked I watched his eyes mingled terror, pity, curiosity. At moment stout charitable-looking old gentleman passing, blind friend I standing. And he passed he threw blind man coppers. But moment he so, seemed possibility his passing without I suspect customary dole, sharp expression came scarcely visible pupils blind man's half-shut eyes (never suspecting his blindness feigned, moment convinced he seen old gentleman) I exclaimed, without thinking absurdity inquiry-- "Was Blind School learnt see well blind eyes?" The "very poor man" gave unpleasant glance his "sightless orbs," taking his stool, muttering something time go home, he departed. Some time afterwards I learnt led believe he best possible reason able "see well his blind eyes." He blind all. CHAPTER VIII VISITING THE SICK I quite prepared find Polly willing convert charitable schemes, I expected find Cousin Helen strong ally she proved. But ideas novelty her, soon discovered. In truth, nine years old, she bit enthusiast. She read avidity religious biographies furnished Miss Blomfield. She delicate health, reticent resolute character. She ready amount self-sacrifice. She contributed liberally box; I fancy she Polly continued I gone back Dacrefield. My new ideas laid aside return home. To best ability I given Nurse Bundle epitome sermon alms--deeds taken fancy, I reason believe she proud precocious benevolence. Whilst subject discussion betwixt us, she related many anecdotes good deeds "young gentlemen ladies" certain clergyman's family she lived nursemaid her younger days; imagination fired dreams soup-cans, coal-clubs, linsey petticoats comforting rheumatic limbs aged women, opportune blankets winter, Sunday-school classes, etc., etc. "My dear!" said Nurse Bundle, almost tears her eyes, "you are world dear mamma again. Keep notions, dear, you are grown gentleman, there will blessing do. For reason it is that will look pa's property tenants time." My father, though adept details commonly called "parish work," liberal kind-hearted. He liked knowing names his tenants, taking interest families. He well pleased respond substantial help Nurse Bundle I pleaded sick woman unshod child, mother pleaded old days. As Nurse Bundle, she code virtues "young ladies gentlemen," such, charity poor among them. Though I confess I think she regarded light grace adorning certain station, duty incumbent upon men. So I came know villagers; quaint child, lively amusing curiosity, little refinement good-breeding stayed degenerating impertinence, I was, I believe, popular. One afternoon, spring followed return London, I strolled Rubens, bowling hoop towards one lodges poor woman passed drive (which public road park), her apron her face, weeping bitterly. I stopped her, asked matter, finally made she sale farmhouse near, certain large blanket "gone for" five shillings. That she scraped five shillings together, intended bid it, (with eminent stupidity) managed way blanket sold; gone sum she could afforded, another woman would part six sixpence--eighteenpence price she paid it. The poor woman wept, said she hard work "raise" five shillings, could possibly find one sixpence more. And yet she want blanket badly, she boy sick bed, his throat bad--he suffered deal cold, was not decent "rag blanket" her house. I quite follow her long story, I gathered one sixpence would put end her troubles, offered fetch her money. "Where live?" I asked. "The white cottage beyond gate, love," she answered. "I bring money," said I. For say truth, I rather pompous important charitable deeds, dislike playing part Sir Bountiful cottages. In case, too, kindness take woman back hall, she left sick child alone; I arrived cottage money he complained bitterly idea her leaving get blanket. "Let go minute, love, I will fetch Mrs. Taylor sit thee till I get blanket." "I do not want blanket," fretted child; "I hot it is. I do not want 'lone." "If you will minute, I will stop him," said I; kindness offer, I really afraid boy his heavy angry eyes fever petulance. The woman gladly accepted it, hurried off, despite child's fretful tears, his refusing see "the young gentleman's" condescension honour his mother pointed out. No doubt she meant "a minute," Mrs. Taylor's dwelling was, knowledge, near; I suppose she tell, her friends hear, whole history sale, her disappointment subsequent relief, preliminary measure. After probable Mrs. Taylor look her pie oven, attend similar pressing domestic duty she could leave her house; nearly half hour came relief. And time sick boy tossed moaned, cried water. I gave mug table, much precocious gift sick nursing (for I simply "frightened wits"), imperative tone his demand forced involuntarily he wanted. He grumbled, us spilt water his clothes, then, soothed seconds, he lay down, till fever, like possessing demon, tossed more, his throat became parched ever, he moaned "a drink," repeated process. This time mug emptied, he called third time I could say, "The mug's empty." "There is pot behind door," he muttered, impatiently; "look sharp!" Now food, drink, necessaries life came without effort seeking, I little accustomed rich man's son forage supplies; occasion circumstances forced helpfulness necessity early teaches poor. I became dimly cognizant fact water spring spontaneously carafes, take delicate colour flavour toast-and-water jugs itself. I found water-pot, replenished mug, went back patient. By time his mother returned I become quite clever checking spasmodic clutches spilt cold water his neck. From Mrs. Taylor said her friend, evident she disapproved way presence, boy's mother replied her whispered remonstrances, "I _that_ put out, I never thought;" I doubt strictly true. As I afterwards learnt, she got blanket, never ceased laud generosity. I rather proud myself, without complacency I recounted Nurse Bundle first essay "visiting sick." But complacency last feeling narrative awoke Mrs. Bundle. She alarmed presence mind; her indignation woman requited kindness allowing go house infected fever knew bounds. She pity spare her news reached us child dead. Nothing came time. Days passed, almost forgotten, I became decidedly ill-tempered. A captious irritability possessed me, alternating fits unaccountable fatigue. At time I always either tired cross, sometimes both. I must made Nurse Bundle uncomfortable. I little happy, share, day's headache I put bed invalid, delicious relief acknowledged ill, throw clothes occupation, shut eyes nursed. This happiness lasted half hour. Then I began shiver, and, lack blankets teeth soon chattering bed shaking me, village boy. But succeeded burning heat, intolerable, consuming restlessness, I would glad shiver again. And mind wandered restlessness intolerable tossing body; boundaries time, place, person became confused indefinitely extended, hot hours like ages, I thought I boy, would wait upon him; sensible words I spoke cries drink; fever got fairly clutches. CHAPTER IX "PEACE BE TO THIS HOUSE" I appreciate father Nurse Bundle must suffered dangerous illness. It common tie bound father's affections life. Not I his son, I his son. Moreover, I living child beloved wife his youth--all remained fair mother. Then I heir his property, hope his family, and, without undue egotism, I may say, I told, I quaint, original, (thanks Mrs. Bundle) ill-behaved child, that, least, I much missed daily life household. Mrs. Cadman told me, long afterwards, exactly many days nights Nurse Bundle passed sick chamber, "and never her clothes off;" wearing clothes one sharpest torments Inquisition, Mrs. Cadman could spoken hollower tone, thrown gloom round announcement. That, humanly speaking, good loving nurse saved life, I must ever remember deep gratitude. There stages fever, when, say, "a nurse everything;" little laziness, selfishness, inattention Nurse Bundle's part would probably death-warrant. But night day she never relaxed her vigilance one instant crisis malady. She took nothing granted, would trust one else, herself saw every order doctor carried out, and, certain stage, fed every ten minutes, will, coaxing obedience, never losing heart temper one instant. And although petulance infrequent assurances I wished preferred die--"I tired"--within sick room, father's despair bitter groan he would sacrifice every earthly possession keep alive, outside it, would caused many people lose heads. In hour many foolish, gossiping, half-educated woman, absolute faithfulness small details her trust, complete laying aside personal needs personal feelings, rises sublimity duty, and, ministering wants another unselfish vigilance almost perfect, earns meed praise men, time time persists, grateful hyperbole, liken her sex angels. My poor father, whose irrepressible distress led his forbidden enter room, powerless help, therefore without alleviation his anxiety, simply hung upon Nurse Bundle's orders reports, relied utterly her. Fortunately his health, she gained sufficient influence insist, almost peremptorily case, upon his taking food. Often afterwards she describe he Rubens sat outside door allowed enter; she used declare she came out, Rubens, well father, turned anxious expectant countenance towards her, alike seemed await understand her report condition. Only Nurse Bundle's self-possession threaten fail her. It repeated urgent request "have clergyman pray me." Mrs. Bundle, like uneducated people, rather regarded visitation sick parish clergyman sort extreme unction last sacrament. And send parson seemed her tantamount dismissing doctor ringing passing bell. My father equally averse idea grounds. Moreover, old rector gone, lately-appointed one stranger, rather eccentric stranger, accounts. For part, I strong interest new rector. His Christian name own, I felt constitute sort connection; tales I heard village his peculiarities woven sort ecclesiastical romance mind. He come out-of-the-way parish west England, his people, thoroughly used his ways, took matter course. It his scrupulous custom conform minutely possible canons Church, well rubrics Prayer Book, point wearing shoes instead boots. He learned man, naturalist, antiquarian. His appearance remarkable, his hair prematurely white, yet thick, his eyes grey expressive, thick dark eyebrows, actually met them. For rest, he tall, thin, dressed obedience canons. I much interested I heard him, since illness I often thought unqualified note praise I heard sounded his favour one village matron, "He is beautiful sick-room." It one occasion I heard I also heard he accustomed entering house pronounce appointed salutation, words Prayer Book, "Peace house, dwell it." And came that, importunity anxiety subject overcome scruples father nurse, decided let way rather increase malady fretting, new rector came room, first eager question was, "Did say that--about Peace, know--when came in?" "I did," said rector; he spoke one his merits became obvious. He pleasing voice. "Say again!" I cried, petulantly. "Peace house, dwell it," he repeated slowly, slightly upraised hand. "That is Rubens all," comment. As I wished, rector prayed bedside; I think he must rather astonished fact points struck I rather groaned said, "Amen." The truth is, I happened go cottage old rector praying bed sick old man--a Methodist--who groaned "Amen" certain points manner greatly impressed me, I likewise, imitativeness childhood helped lead fancy surrounding sick bed circumstances I seen heard cases village. For reason I (to her hardly concealed distress) given Nurse Bundle, time time, directions wishes event death. I remember especially, I begged she would fail cover furniture white cloths, allow friends come see coffin. Thus also I groaned said "Amen"--"like poor person"--at I deemed suitable points, rector prayed. He less wise sick room Mrs. Bundle herself. He contrived quieten instead exciting me, sound his melodious voice reading soothing monotone favourite book Bible--the Revelation St. John Divine--I finally fell asleep. When inspired description New Jerusalem ended, dream began, I never knew. As I dreamed, seemed wonderful beautiful vision, though I could ever remember waking hours sheerest nonsense. And beginning acquaintance Rev. Reginald Andrewes. CHAPTER X CONVALESCENCE--MATRIMONIAL INTENTIONS--THE JOURNEY TO OAKFORD--OUR WELCOME On day I first left sick room, moved sofa poor mother's boudoir, father put fifty pounds Nurse Bundle's hand, sent another fifty Mr. Andrewes communion vessels church, rector set his heart. They thank-offerings. "I owe son's recovery GOD, you, Mrs. Bundle," said father, certain elaborateness speech he given important occasions. "No money could purchase care bestowed him, money reward it; farther favour allow think that, sickness ever overtake longer together, little sum, laid by, may come useful, afford comforts." That first evening convalescence quite jubilant; afterwards many weary days weakness, irritability, _ennui_ part, anxiety disappointment father's. Rubens great comfort period. For his winning ways formed interest, served little vary monotony hours I weak bear definite amusement occupation. It must time long cogitation led following conversations Nurse Bundle father:-- "How old you, Nurse?" I inquired, one forenoon, she neatly arranged tray containing chop, wine, etc., chair. "Five-and-fifty, love, come September," said Nurse Bundle. "Do people ever marry five-and-fifty, papa?" I asked evening, I lay languid weary sofa. "Yes, dear boy, sometimes. But want know?" "I think I shall marry Nurse Bundle I old enough," I said, almost melancholy gravity. "She is good deal older I am; I love her much. And she would make comfortable. She knows ways." My father often told he would laughed aloud, sad air utter weariness helpless figure, painful, unchildlike anxiousness thin face, old-fashioned air attitude. I quite forgotten occurrence. At last trying time over, fever left taller, weaker, much need doctors call "tone." All concerned care unanimous declaring I must "change air." There little difficulty deciding go. Another visit Aunt Maria question. Even London suitable place, fear infection cousins made thought of. "Where would _you_ like go, Nurse?" I inquired one evening, sat boudoir discussing topic day. "I like go wherever it is best good health, Master Reginald," Nurse Bundle's answer, which, though admirable spirit, settlement matter found difficult decide. "But would like go yourself?" I persisted. "Where would go going away, nobody else?" "Well, dear, going away myself, I think I go sister's Oakford." This reply drew catechism questions Oakford, Nurse Bundle's sister, Nurse Bundle's sister's husband, children; father came sit I long history Oakford Nurse Bundle's relatives fingers' ends, full new fancy, strong upon me, go stay awhile Oakford Mr. Mrs. Benjamin Buckle. "Nurse says sometimes let lodgings," I said; "and I like Nurse see her sister; and," I candidly added, "I like see her myself." My father's uppermost wish please me; Oakford known healthy, doctor favoured proposition, decided according wishes. If stayed long, father go backwards forwards, he fetch us went away. His anxiety still great, led watch manner fidgeted much, I think doctor glad place sufficiently near induce leave care Nurse Bundle. We went coach Oakford. I allowed sit outside journey. It short one, however; and, truth say, I feel strong enough feats energy, went meekly enough stuffy hole, inside! Before following me, Nurse Bundle gave directions driver, kind could effectual reference small place everybody known. "Coachman! Oakford! And drop us Mr. Buckle's, please, saddler." "High Street, is not it?" said fat coachman, looking Mrs. Bundle exactly parrot looks his perch. "To sure; three doors 'Crown.'" With Mrs. Bundle gathered her skirts, her worsted workbag, clambered coach. There two "insides." One never spoke journey. The spoke once, he seems impelled thereto three hours' contemplation contrast slim, wasted little figure, Nurse Bundle's portly person, sat opposite him. He Scotchman, I fancy "in business." "You are weel matched sit one side," his remark. Once, I feeling faint, he opened window without spoken, acknowledged thanks silent nod. When coach stopped High Street Oakford, Nurse Bundle descended, he far relaxed, he handed worsted workbag, indulge his national thirst general information inquiring remark: "You will staying 'Crown' night, mem?" "No, sir. We stop here," said Nurse Bundle. I caught his keen blue eye window whilst coach delayed getting luggage. I think he missed one feature welcome threshold saddler's shop. I feel sure Scotchmen greatly profit habit "absorbing constitutions," speak, facts every kind come within ken. They "go general information," like Tom Toddy Mr. Kingsley's 'Water Babies;' hard heads have, fortunately, likeness turnips. This, however, digression. Mr. Benjamin Buckle, Mrs. Benjamin Buckle, Jemima Buckle, daughter, Mr. Buckle's apprentice, "general girl," maid-of-all-work, shop receive us. I believe cat living creature house there. But cats seldom exert unnecessarily behalf people, she awaited arrival upstairs. I severe undignified struggle string I could get hat off. Then I advanced, and, holding hand Mr. Buckle, said, "Mr. Buckle, I believe?" "The you, sir, many them," said Mr. Buckle, hastily; being, I fancy, rather put touch frail hand, certainly unlike leather he handled daily. He saw his mistake, added quickly, "Your servant, sir. I hope health's better, sir?" "Very well, thank you," said I (all children make answer, I think). "What little gentleman!" said Mrs. Buckle, audible "aside" nurse. She good-natured woman Mrs. Bundle herself, less brains. She lived chronic state surprises superlatives. "You Nurse's sister, are not you, please?" I asked, going her, tendering hand. "I wanted see much." "Now think that, Jemima! ever?" cried Mrs. Buckle. "La!" said Jemima; acknowledgment striking remark, I bent head, said, "How do, Jemima?" adding, almost without instant's pause, "Please take away, Nurse! I tired." By one immediate unbroken action, Mrs. Bundle cut her way hospitable friends scattered rolls leather trade accessories shop, conveyed arm-chair sitting-room upstairs, I sat, tears running face weakness. I longed novelty residence saddler's shop; now, weary new experiences, I conscious stairs narrow, room dingy vulgar rooms home, I wept I wished I never come. At day, I glad I courtesy restrain feelings, damp delighted welcome Nurse her friends insulting avowal disappointment. I really spoilt child; indeed, insolent undisciplined egotism many children "now-a-days," often tolerated past generation. As I sat silent sad, Nurse Bundle ransacked her bag, muttering, "What fool I be, sure!" anon produced flask wine, she filled wine-glass big leg, one chimney ornaments. I emptied obedience her orders, minutes tears ceased, I began take cheerful view wallpaper antimacassars. "What pretty cat!" I said, last. The said cat, beauty, lying hearthrug. "Is not beauty, love?" said Nurse Bundle; "and look, dear, little dog lying good gold rocking-chair, much looking puss." Rubens _quite_ deserve panegyric. He lay his chair without touching puss, true; he kept his eye firmly constantly fixed upon her, restrained attack known objection proceedings, immovable composure good lady herself. Half movement encouragement part, half movement flight cat's, Rubens would her. All plainly expressed his attitude, I burst laughing. Rubens chose take sound chase, peremptory orders could I induce keep quiet. As cat, I saw one convulsive twitch tip her tail, eloquent wrath; otherwise she never moved. "Now, dear," said Mrs. Bundle, "suppose come upstairs bed, get good night's rest. I hear Jemima a-shaking coals warming-pan now, stairs." Warming-pans much used home, I greatly interested brazen implement Jemima wielded dexterously. "It is like ironing cloth," comment I got sheets. I often warmed hands table Nurse ironed collars home. Rubens duly came bed; I fell asleep, well satisfied whole Oakford saddler's household. CHAPTER XI THE TINSMITH'S--THE BEAVER BONNETS--A FLAT IRON FOR A FARTHING--I FAIL TO SECURE A SISTER--RUBENS AND THE DOLL Oakford large town. It boasted one street, "to called street," Mr. Buckle phrased it, though two three lanes, less pretentious rows houses, forth, ran right angles High Street. The High Street steep hill. It tolerably broad, clean, pebbled picturesque. The "Crown Inn" old house historical legend attached it. Several shops also old houses, overhanging upper stories comfortable window seats. Mr. Buckle's one these. The air place keen, healthy, I seemed gain strength every hour stay. With strength, interest novelty situation woke afresh, I delighted everything, especially shop. On subject saddlery business, I must confess difference opinion existed excellent nurse. She jealously maintained position "young gentleman" lodger, familiarity Buckles I fell common consent. She served meals separate state, kept Jemima well herself attendance wants. She made sitting-room comfortable she could, her wish I sit, house, "like young gentleman." My wish, contrary, shop, much possible like grown-up saddler. It seem delightful always working nice-smelling leather, able make oneself unlimited straps, whips, masculine appendages. I perfectly happy spare fragments, cutting miniature saddles straps, stamping lines, punching holes, mislaying good saddler's tools efforts; whilst thoughts occupied many childish plan inducing father apprentice worthy Mr. Buckle. I good deal taken Mr. Buckle's apprentice, rosy-cheeked young man, whose dress manners I endeavoured much possible imitate. I strutted imitation his style walking High Street, time Nurse Bundle will not say she "could not think come to" hat, "always stuck one side." Pondering history Dick Whittington fair Alice, I said one day Jemima Buckle, "I suppose Andrew marry, Mr. Buckle dies shop?" "Me marry 'prentice!" said Miss Jemima. And I discovered little I knew shades "caste" Oakford. Jemima used often take Nurse Bundle otherwise engaged, always good friends. One day, I remember, she going shop half way High Street, I obtained leave go her. Mrs. Bundle busy superintending cooking special delicacy her "young gentleman's" dinner, Jemima I set forth errand. It tinsmith's shop, bath ordered accommodation. Ah! many years steep street, clean, sunny stones, irregular line quaint old buildings, distant glimpse big trees within palings passed top, town touched outskirts gentleman's place, remained mind like picture! Getting little vague years, perhaps little altered, fancy almost involuntarily supplied defects memory; still steep street, tinsmith's shop--_the_ features Oakford! I since thought Jemima must special attraction tinsmith's, her errands many, took much time. This occasion may divided three distinct periods. During first, I waited state vacant patience whereby one endures people's shopping. During second, I walked round cans, pans, colanders, graters, took fancy tin mug. It neither valuable handsome silver mug dragon handles given Indian godfather, novelty. When I looked closer, however, I found marked, plain figures, fourpence, time beyond means; I walked door, I might solace third period looking street. As I looked, came hill fine, large, sleek donkey, led old man-servant, back called Spanish saddle, two little girls sat side side, whole party jogging quietly along foot's pace sunshine. I may say experience little girls almost entirely confined cousins, I overwhelmed impressed loveliness two children, quaint, queenly little ways, time dimmed one line picture made upon mind. I see clearly I saw then, I stood tinsmith's door High Street Oakford--let see, many years ago? ("Never mind," says wife; "go story, dear," I go on.) The child looked older, was, I afterwards discovered, younger two, also less pretty. And yet she sweet little face, hair like spun gold, blue-grey eyes dark lashes. She wore grey frock warm material, peeped her indoors dress blue. The outer coat quaint cape like coachman's, relieved broad white crimped frill round her throat. Her legs cased knitted gaiters white wool, her hands comical miniatures gloves. On her fairy head she wore large bonnet grey beaver, frill inside. (My wife explains "cap-front," adorned little bunches ribbon, cap attached it, whole put separately bonnet. Details seem amuse little daughters, less interest sons.) But her sister shone young eyes like fairy vision. She looked delicate, brilliant, utterly lovely, anywhere fairy-land. She ought kept tissue-paper, like loveliest wax dolls. Her hair true flaxen, fairest fair. The purity vividness tints red white her face I never seen equalled. Her eyes speedwell blue, looked meant always less brimming tears. To say truth, her face half character gave force little damsel, certain helplessness gave peculiar charm. She dressed exactly like other, one exception; her bonnet white beaver, she became like queen. At tinsmith's door stopped, old man-servant, unbuckling strap seemed support saddle, lifted little miss turn ground. Once pavement, little lady grey beaver shook herself out, proceeded straighten disarranged overcoat her companion, then, taking her hand, two clambered step shop. The tinsmith's shop boasted two seats, one she grey beaver difficulty climbed. The eyes fast filling tears, her lofty perch sister caught sight man-servant, stood doorway, she beckoned wave her tiny finger. "Lift her up, please," she said, his approach. And child placed chair. The shopman appeared know them, though he smiled, he said respectfully, "What article I show morning, ladies?" The fairy-like creature white beaver, fumbling her miniature glove, timidly laid farthing counter, turning her back shyness shopman, raised one small shoulder, inclining her head towards it, gave appealing glance her sister pale-blue eyes. That little lady, thus appealed to, firmly placed another farthing board, said tiniest decided voices, "TWO FLAT IRONS, IF YOU PLEASE." Hereupon shopman produced drawer counter, set them. What contained I tall enough see, he took several tiny flat irons triangular shape, apparently made pewter, alloy tin. These grey beaver examined tried upon corner her cape inimitable gravity importance. At last she selected two, keeping one herself, gave her sister. "Is nice one?" little white-beavered lady inquired. "Very nice." "_Kite_ nice yours?" she persisted. "Just same," said other, firmly. And glanced corner see farthings duly deposited, she rolled abruptly her seat, scrambled backwards, manoeuvre child accomplished difficulty. The coats capes put tidy before, two went shop together hand hand. Then old man-servant lifted Spanish saddle, buckled strap, away went steep street, brow hill, trees palings began show, beaver bonnets nodding together consultation flat irons. CHAPTER XII THE LITTLE LADIES AGAIN--THE MEADS--THE DROWNED DOLL "Mr. Buckle, sir, oblige eight farthings twopence?" I closely copied form speech apprentice, whose ways, I said, I endeavoured every way imitate. Thus, twopence time extent resources, I went days adventure tinsmith's worldly wealth pocket farthings, pondering many matters. [Illustration: She rolled abruptly her seat scrambled backwards.] I began doubts saddlery profession. Truth say, want beyond cutting punching leather begun stir within me. I wished sister. Somehow I never desired adopt one cousins relation, even dear friend Polly; since I seen little lady white beaver, I felt nice would sister play with, I heard sisters brothers playing together. Then I fancied showing her possessions home, begging like her indulgent father. I pictured new interest old toys would derive exhibited her. I thought I would beg exhibition magic lantern, garden her like own, several half-holidays. It delighted imagine presenting her whatever she admired, like Eastern potentate fairy godmother. But I could connect her mind saddlery business. I felt possess dainty elegant little lady sister incompatible apprenticeship Mr. Buckle. Meanwhile I kept watch High Street Mr. Buckle's door. One morning I saw donkey, man, Spanish saddle, beaver bonnets come brow hill, I forthwith ran Nurse Bundle, begged leave go alone tinsmith's, invest one eight farthings flat iron. It yards off, she consented; but, I submit dressed, time I got little ladies already shop, seated two chairs. My fairy beauty looked round I came in, recognizing me, gave little low laugh, put her head her shoulder, peeped again, smiling sweetly I fairly loved her. The deeply engaged poking fumbling farthings her glove permit herself distracted anything anybody. This process slow shopman came asked I wanted. I took well-warmed farthing handful I carried, laid counter, saying-- "A flat iron, please." He put several me, making show testing end comforter, I selected one random. I know I half air little grey-beavered lady thrown proceeding, I hardly deserved scornful tone she addressed one particular remark, "He business flat irons. He is boy." She evidently expected reply, without pause she proceeded count five farthings counter, saying she so, "A frying-pan, gridiron, dish, two plates, please." On which, astonishment, miniature specimens articles, made material flat irons, produced box whence come. I bewildered severity little lady's remarks, wonderful things she obtained her farthings, I dropped remaining seven shop floor, still grubbing dust, children finished shopping, came backwards seats usual. They passed doorway, hand hand. The little lady white beaver next me, she passed she gave shy glance, her face dimpled smiles. Unspeakably pleased her recognition, I abandoned farthings fate, jumping up, I held dusty hand little damsel, saying hastily civilly I could, "How do? I hope you are pretty well. And oh, please, _will_ sister?" Having begun, I felt quite equal full explanation position prospect toys treats us both. I even prepared, generous excitement moment endow new sister joint partnership possession Rubens, explain advantages little lady would derive brother, I stopped changed expression her pretty face. I suppose sudden movement startled her, her smiles vanished look terror, she clung her companion, opened wide her eyes, shaking her grey beaver vehemently, said, "We do not know you, Boy!" Then fled side old man-servant fast white-gaitered legs would carry them. I watered dusty floor shop tears vexation I resumed search farthings, found I went back saddler's, pounding hot hand, bitterly disappointed. I do not suppose Rubens understood feelings gave extra warmth caresses, I hugged arms, exclaiming, "_You_ are not afraid me, dear thing!" But he responded sympathetically, tongue tail. I frightened little ladies away High Street, seemed. I saw two days later. They usual, trifling mischance happened Spanish saddle, called Mr. Buckle's door repairs. I shop, could see two little maidens sat hanging strap, doll dressed much like them. I crept nearer door, quick grey eyes younger one caught sight me, I heard her say her peculiarly trenchant tones-- "Why, there is Boy again!" I slipped little one side, took tool bit leather pretence working, hoping sight, yet able look little white-beavered fairy, fancy way abated. But her keen-eyed sister saw still, her next remark rang uncompromising distinctness-- "He is shop still. He is working. He must shop-boy!" I dropped tools, rushed away sitting-room. My mortification complete, kind Rubens could understand. Fortunately me, he simply went humour, without particular reason it, like tenderest women. A day two afterwards I went Rubens Jemima Buckle walk. Our way home lay flat green meads, crossed stream, which, turn, crossed little rustic bridge. As came fields met man whose face seemed familiar, though I could first recall I seen him. Afterwards I remembered he tinsmith, Jemima stayed chat minutes, Rubens I strolled on. It seemed odd coincidence that, seconds meeting tinsmith, I meet little white-beavered lady. She crossing bridge. Her sister her, donkey, man-servant. She walking nurse, she carried big doll her arms. The doll, I said before, "got up" wonderfully like mistress. It miniature coat cape frills, leggings, white plush bonnet (so wife enables affirm), hair colour little lady's locks. As she crossed bridge, she seemed much pleased running water beneath her feet, saying, "Please let Dolly 'ook," her pretty broken tones, she pushed her doll rustic work, holding sash. But, alas! doll heavy, sash insecurely fastened. It gave way, doll plunged stream. Once sweet little face convulsed look terror distress. As doll floated side bridge, she shrieked wrung her hands. As me, I ran edge stream, calling Rubens me, pointing doll. Only glad excuse plunge, he dashed, soon brought unfortunate miss shore one her gaitered legs. It triumph I carried dripping doll little mistress, heard nurse admonish her to-- "Thank young gentleman, dear." I often since heard faces "like April sky," I never saw one resemble turns bright overcast, tears smiles struggling together, fear pleased recognition, face little blonde white beaver bonnet. It she held her hand time, I took she said, "'ank 'erry much." "It Rubens' doing, mine," said I. "Rubens! shake hands, sir!" But little lady frightened. She shrank away warm greeting Rubens, I obliged shake hands satisfy his feelings. The nursemaid wringing doll's clothes little lady, moved together. "Dood-bye!" said little lady, smiling waving her hand. I waved mine, Jemima, parted tinsmith, came up, went home. I never saw beaver bonnets again. CHAPTER XIII POLLY--THE PEW AND THE PULPIT--THE FATE OF THE FLAT IRON By time father came fetch us away, I wonderfully improved health strength. I even wanted go back outside coach; allowed. I forget little lady white beaver, even return Dacrefield. I fond drawing, I made seemed rather striking portrait her (at least colouring), wore tied bit string round neck. It unromantic confess fell last washhand basin, reduced pulp. I brought farthing flat-iron home me, long favourite plaything. I used sprinkle corners pocket-handkerchief water, I seen Nurse Bundle "damp fine things" ironing them. But all, "play" kind dull work played alone. I glad Polly came. It weeks return father proposed ask Cousin Polly pay us visit. I think aunt said something letter her well, visit supposed benefit her health. She ill long Dacrefield. My "lessons" slight description yet, spent time doors. The fun showing Polly farm grounds quite satisfactory dream flaxen-haired sister promised. I quite prepared yield Cousin Polly things before; she, doubt deference position host, met halfway unusual affability graciousness. Country life exactly suited her. I think she profoundly happy exploring garden, making friends cows horses, feeding rabbits chickens, "playing haunted castles" barn. Her vigour daring climbed trees together objects constant admiration. Tree-climbing Polly's favourite amusement, various fancies she "pretended" connection it, credit her imaginative powers. Sometimes she "pretended" Jack Beanstalk; sometimes she pretended mast-head ship sea; sometimes upper story fairy-house; sometimes escaping bear; sometimes (with recollections London) bear pole, monkey Zoological Gardens; top Monument St. Paul's. Our common game, however, time-honoured drama "houses." Each branch constituted story, used emulate exploits high climbing, formula ran thus:-- "Now I am area" (the lowest branch). "Now I am dining-room floor" (the next), on, ending with, "And I am poor person garret." There two trees stood near other, equal difficulty. We used climb one, started together, one first became "very poor person garret" held winner game. We allowed climb trees Sunday, severe exercise Polly's principles. One Sunday afternoon, however, much amazement, she led away shrubbery, saying, "My dear Regie! I have found two trees I am sure may climb Sundays." Much puzzled, I nevertheless yielded her, quite accustomed trust her proceedings. I enlightened appearance trees, much like others ladder-like peculiarities. They old Portugal laurels cut good deal various times. They looked easy climb, seem boast many "stories." I see anything adapted Sunday amusement particular. But Polly soon explained herself. "Look here, Regie," said she; "this tree got three beautiful branches, one clerk, one reading-desk, one pulpit. I am going get top one preach sermon; you are sit tree--it makes capital pew. I am sure it is quite Sunday game," added Polly, mounting pulpit her accustomed energy. I seated tree; Polly, consuming time "settling herself," appeared ready; she still hesitated, finally burst laughing. "I beg pardon," she added, rubbing her hands her laughing mouth, composing herself. "Now I am going begin." But she still giggled, led say-- "Never mind text, you are laughing. Begin without." "Very well," said Polly. There another break down, she seemed fairly grave. "My dear brethren," she began. "There is one us," I ventured observe. "Now, Regie, must not speak. The congregation never speaks clergyman he is preaching." "It is small congregation," I pleaded. "Well, then, I will not preach all, go like that," said Polly. But, I saw she getting cross, I intention offending her, I apologized, begged her proceed her sermon. So she began accordingly-- "My dear brethren." But she paused; moments expectation part, silence Polly's, she said-- "Is pew comfortable, Regie dear?" "Very," said I. "How like pulpit?" "Very much indeed," said Polly; "but I do not think I preach without cushion. Suppose talk." Thus sermon abandoned; Polly refused let try luck pulpit, she remained considerably higher level I was. At last I became impatient fact, began climb higher. "Stop!" cried Polly; "you must not leave pew." "I am going gallery," happy thought enabled say. Polly made answer. She seemed meditating step; presently I saw her scramble ground her rapid fashion. "Regie dear, promise get pulpit till I come back?" she begged. I gave promise; and, without answering questions she going do, she sped towards house. In five minutes she returned something held skirt her frock, seemed greatly incommode her climbing. At last she reached pulpit, she stay there. Up she went, much hindered her burden. "Polly! Polly!" I cried. "You must not go higher pulpit. You know is not fair. The pulpit top one, must stay there. The clergyman never goes gallery." "I am going gallery," she gasped; she went topmost large branches. There she paused, her lap she drew forth dinner-bell. "I am belfry," she shouted tones triumph, "and I am going ring bell service." Which she accordingly did, hearty goodwill Nurse Bundle several others household came see matter. My father laughed loudly, Mrs. Bundle seriously displeased. "Master Reginald would never thought thing Sunday afternoon you, Miss Polly," she said, partiality her "own boy" offended sense justice. "I climbed tree too, Nurse," I said, emphatically. "And Sunday kind climbing," Polly pleaded. But Nurse Bundle refused see force Polly's idea; ignominiously dismissed nursery, thenceforward obliged, before, confine tree-climbing exploits six working days week. And Portugal laurels bore names Pulpit Pew ever afterwards. * * * * * I showed flat iron Polly, she much pleased I greatly regretted I brought away one Oakford. I given her, connection little white-beavered lady. We played it; suggestion Polly's, gave quite new character "wash" (or rather "ironing," omitted earlier processes laundry). We used cut small models clothes white paper, iron farthing iron. How nobly domestic implement duty till luckless day Polly became uneasy "put fire get hot!" "Nurse does not like us play fire," I conscientiously reminded her. "It is playing fire; it is putting iron hob," said Polly. And unworthy evasion I yielded, and--my arm longer Polly's--put flat iron top bar nursery grate hand. Whilst iron heating went back scissors paper. "You cut white petticoats, Regie dear," said Polly, "and I make iron-holder;" she calmly cut several inches end her sash, began fold purpose. Aunt Maria's nursery discipline firm, her nature independent, almost aggressiveness; Polly inherited enough latter counteract repression former. Thus Cousin Polly's proceedings direct, and, necessary, daring. When she cut her sash, I exclaimed--"My dear Polly!" Uncle Ascott will not times cry--"My dear Maria!" "I would nothing else make of," said Polly, calmly. "It is better cutting pocket-handkerchief, shortens little, Mamma often cuts ends little sashes ravel. How many petticoats done, dear?" "Four," said I. "Well, we have three skirts. Those long strips Uncle Reginald's neckties. You cut last sheet two pieces, we will pretend they are tablecloths. And I think you would better fetch iron. Here is holder." "Oh! Polly dear! It fun!" I cried; I drew near fireplace words died away lips. My flat iron gone. At first I thought fallen hearth; looking nearer I saw blob button lead upon bar grate. There resisting conviction forced upon me: flat iron melted. Polly much distressed. Doubly she misfortune. As examining shapeless lump metal, she said, "It is like little lump silver Miss Blomfield hanging her watch chain;" determined hole made remains flat iron, same. "Papa promised watch next birthday," I added. Polly I happy merry together; her visit came end last. Aunt Maria came fetch her. She brought her she came, stayed one night. On occasion she stayed Saturday Monday. Aunt Maria never allowed girls travel alone, never allowed visit without her relations' houses. One consequence was, grew up, large young women large noses, helpless creatures railway-station I ever beheld. Whilst Aunt Maria us, she "spoke seriously," called, father education. I think she shocked discover thoroughly Polly I "running wild" Polly's visit. Whether father given rash assent proposals studying together, Aunt Maria may made her last visit, not, I know. Anyway, aunt seemed shocked, enlarged father waste time involved allowing run wild long. My father apt "take things easy," I fancy he made vague promises education, satisfied aunt time. Polly I parted much grief sides. Aunt Maria took her back her lessons, I left loneliness. I felt Polly's loss much, especially father happened good deal engaged then, Nurse Bundle busy superintending new arrangements nursery premises. I think she missed Polly herself; quiet weeks. We almost felt dull. "Of course country place _is_ quiet," Mrs. Bundle said one evening housekeeper, tea change. "Anybody feels ever lived town, people always dropping in." "What is 'dropping in,' Nurse?" I asked. "Well, dear, calling anybody's house, sitting friendly way, exchange weather pass time like." "That must nice," I said. "Like Oakford," Mrs. Bundle continued, "and I could drop in, might afternoon, take seat sister's ask good healths." "I wish could," said I. The idea fermented brain, ideas will not do, large share solitary hours fell lot. The result following adventure. CHAPTER XIV RUBENS AND I "DROP IN" AT THE RECTORY--GARDENS AND GARDENERS--MY FATHER COMES FOR ME One fine morning, father busy farm-bailiff, Mrs. Bundle "sorting" clothes, I took best hat wardrobe, deliberately, difficulty put clean frill, fastened boots, calling Rubens me, set forth hall unnoticed family. Rubens jumped inquiring fashion went along. He could imagine going. I knew quite well. I making Rectory, road I knew. I often thought I like go see Mr. Andrewes, Mrs. Bundle's remarks housekeeper suggested idea calling upon him. We near neighbours, though live town. I resolved "drop in" Rectory. It lovely morning, Rubens I quite enjoyed walk. He became much excited difficulty I withheld chasing ducks pond Mr. Andrewes' farm-yard, went it. (The parson little farm attached his Rectory.) Then I difficulty unlatched heavy gate leading drive, fastened scrupulous care country squire's son. The grounds exquisitely kept. Mr. Andrewes first-rate gardener fair farmer. That neatness, without brightest flowers "show themselves" (as gardeners say), full justice every luxuriant shrub, set pale, delicately-beautiful border snowdrops crocuses edged road, clumps daffodil, polyanthus, primrose flowers dotted hither thither. I surprised hear chorus birds head, one parson's "oddities" he would birds shot his premises. When I came flower-garden, exquisite neatness, bright spring flowers, thinly scattered comparison summer blossoms, shining brightly rich dark mould. And turf lying gardening-tools, busy among tools flower-beds two men--the Rev. Reginald Andrewes his gardener. It took several seconds distinguish master man. They straw hats shirt sleeves, I recognised parson his trousers. His hat older two, means "canonical." Having found him, I went bed he busy, sat grass near him, without speaking. (I accustomed respect father's "busy" moments, yet him.) Rubens followed example, sat silence also. He smelt parson before, wagged his tail faintly he saw him. But he reserved his opinion gardener, seemed rather disposed growl he touched wheelbarrow. "Bless me!" said Mr. Andrewes, startled, he well might be, appearance. "Why, dear boy, you?" "Very well, thank you," said I, getting offering hand; "I have dropped in." "Dear me!" said Mr. Andrewes; "I mean, I am glad see you! Will not come in? You must not sit grass." "What pretty garden have!" I said, walked slowly towards house. Mr. Andrewes turned round. "Well, pretty well. It amuses me, know," he said, mock humility real horticulturist. And he looked round his garden unmistakable glance pride affection. "Have garden, Reginald?" he inquired. "Yes," I said. "At least, I have two beds border. The beds shaped like R D. But I have not touched since I ill. The gardener tidied I Oakford, I think he dug plants. At least I could not find Bachelor's Button, London Pride, Pansies, I saw Lavender-bush rubbish-heap." "So do--so always do!" said parson, excitedly. "The way keep garden them, let nothing go wheelbarrow see.--Jones! may go dinner. I watch Jones like dragon, he sweeps tap-root then, same; yet he is better them. Some flowers especially apt take leave one's beds borders," Mr. Andrewes went on. He talking rather time. "Fraxinellas, double-grey primroses, ay, pink white ones too. And hepaticas, red, blue, white." "What hepaticas like?" I asked. "Let show you," said Mr. Andrewes, crossing garden. "Look here! pretty little things. I seen growing wild Canada--single ones, is. The leaves dull green, fade, whole plant hardly distinguished Mother Earth--at least, gardener's eye. If promise let gardener meddle them, unless look him, I give plants beds borders, boy." "Oh, thank you," I said; "I like gardening much. I like garden like you. I have got spade, hoe, fork, I rake, it is lost. But I know papa give another; I tidy beds, gardener need touch them; wheelbarrow small enough wheel, I could take weeds away myself, know." And I chattered garden, for, like children, I apt "take up" things warmly, imitation people; Mr. Andrewes already fired imagination dreams little garden perfect order beauty, tended hands alone; I talked garden, parson talked his, wandered border border, finding good company, Rubens walking demurely heels. A great many Mr. Andrewes' remarks, though I sure instructive, beyond power understanding; he closed lecture various flowers promise root, cutting, sucker, seedling, bulb, case might be, I attentive well-satisfied listener. I much admired daffodils, Mr. Andrewes began pick bunch me. "Is not pity pick them?" I said, politely. "My dear Regie," said Mr. Andrewes, "if ever see anybody good garden flowers grudges picking his friends, may quite sure he learnt half his flowers teach him. Flowers generous enough. The take give. And yet I seen people beds glowing geraniums, trees laden roses, grudged pluck them, knowing would bloom better luxuriantly culled." "Do daffodils flower better flowers picked off?" I asked, full share childish propensity asking awkward candid questions. Mr. Andrewes laughed. "Well, no. I must confess quite like geraniums respect. And spring flowers precious, one may excused quite cutting like summer flowers. But would not generous costs one nothing. Eh, Regie?" I laughed said "No," I expected say, thanked parson daffodils. He pulled his watch. "My dear boy, it is luncheon time. Will come something eat me?" I hesitated; Mrs. Bundle spoken meal connection ceremony "dropping in," but, hand, I certainly like lunch Rectory, I thought. And, indeed, I hungry. "Oh, must come," said Mr. Andrewes, leading away without waiting answer. "I am sure must hungry, dog too. What is his name, eh?" "Rubens," said I. "Does he paint?" Mr. Andrewes inquired. But I knew nothing Painter Peter Paul Rubens his works, I puzzled, said he knew good many tricks I taught him. "We will see he beg chicken-bones," said parson, hospitably; indoors went. Mr. Andrewes said grace, though words I accustomed, sat together, Rubens lying chair. I endeavoured conduct strictest propriety, I believe succeeded, except trifling mischance spilling bread-sauce jacket. Mr. Andrewes saw this, however, wanted fasten table-napkin round me, I objected. "Too like pinafore, eh?" said he, sly laugh. "I do not think I ought wear pinafores now," I said, grave injured tone. "Leo Damer does not, he is much older I am. But I think," I added, candidly, "he rather he likes, he is got nobody look him." The parson laughed, gave heavy sigh. "I wish mother could come back, tie pinafore round neck!" he exclaimed, abruptly. Then I believe he suddenly remembered I lost mother vexed his hasty speech. I saw nothing inconsiderate remark, however, said, "Is mother dead?" "Yes, boy. Many years ago," said Mr. Andrewes. "Did father marry anybody else?" I inquired. "My father died mother." "Dear me," said I; "how sad! Leo's father mother died together. They drowned his father's yacht." I middle history friend Leo, visit London, bell pealed loudly house. "Somebody is hurry," said Mr. Andrewes; "that is front-door bell." In three minutes dining-room door opened, servant announced "Mr. Dacre." It would untrue say I feel little guilty father walked room. And yet I really thought "any harm" expedition. I think I chiefly annoyed ignominious end it. It trying, "dropping in" "taking luncheon" like grown-up gentleman, fetched home lost child. "What could make run away like this, Regie?" said poor bewildered parent. "Mrs. Bundle nearly mad fright. It naughty you. What thinking of?" "I thought I would drop in," I explained. And pause resulting father's astonishment absurd old-fashioned demeanour, I proceeded Nurse Bundle's definition well I could recollect confusion, speak impending tears. "So I came, Rubens came, Mr. Andrewes garden, sat down, change weather, pass time like, Mr. Andrewes garden, he gave flowers, Mr. Andrewes asked in, I came in, he gave luncheon he asked Rubens bones, and--" "'Change weather pass time like,'" muttered father. "Servants' language! oh, dear!" In vexation things general, strong feeling within I wrong, I seized upon first grievance occurred excuse fretfulness, quoted Nurse Bundle. "It is quiet home," I whimpered, tears eyes, really sort connection dulness Hall, anything whatever offended pride vexation part. Ah! How many stab one gives childhood one's parents' tenderest feelings! I mean ungrateful, I measure pain father felt hint insufficiency he comfort pleasure home. Mr. Andrewes knew better, said, hastily, "Just love novelty, Mr. Dacre. We children ourselves." My father sighed, sitting down, drew towards one hand, stroking Rubens other, acknowledgment his greeting wagging tail. Then I saw he hurt. Indeed, I fancied tears his eyes he said, "So poor Papa home dull--too quiet, eh, Regie? And yet Papa he his boy." My fit ill-temper gone moment, I flung arms round father's neck--Rubens taking flying leaps join embrace, fashion common dogs, decidedly dangerous eyes, nose, ears. And I kissed father, kissed Rubens, I gave candid account expedition. "No, dear papa. It was not that. Only Nurse said country places quiet, towns people dropped in, passed time, changed weather, she Oakford she would drop see her sister. And I said would nice. And I thought morning Rubens I would drop see Mr. Andrewes. And did; did not tell wanted come alone, fun." With explanation fullest harmony restored; father sat whilst Mr. Andrewes I finished luncheon Rubens his. I gave account garden terms glowing enough satisfy pride warmest horticulturist, father promised new rake, drank glass sherry success "gardening without gardener." But going away I overheard saying Mr. Andrewes, "All same, boy cannot nurse ever. She every good quality, except good English. And he baby now. One forgets time passes. I must see tutor." CHAPTER XV NURSE BUNDLE IS MAGNANIMOUS--MR. GRAY--AN EXPLANATION WITH MY FATHER Naturally enough, I best give Nurse Bundle faithful account attempt realize her idea "dropping in," came it. My garden projects, arrival father, he said occasion. From childish confused account, I fancy Nurse Bundle made pretty correctly state case. Being "grown-up person," she probably guessed, without difficulty, meaning father's concluding remarks. I think good, faithful, tender-hearted nurse, she was, must suffer mother's feelings, first decided "her boy" beyond petticoat government. Nurse Bundle cried bitterly matter, chivalrous feelings roused, I vowed "Papa should not say things vex dear Nursey." But Mrs. Bundle loyal. "My dear," said she, wiping her eyes her apron, "depend upon it, whatever papa settles right. He knows what is suitable young gentleman; it is likely young gentleman born bred outgrow beyond old woman like him. Though there is tutors none ever love better poor Nurse Bundle, deary. And there is one ever loved better, dear, ever will--always excepting dear mamma, dead gone." All stirred feelings uttermost, I wept too, vowed unconquerable fidelity Nurse Bundle, (despite her remonstrances) unconquerable aversion tutor be. I furthermore renewed proposals marriage Mrs. Bundle,--the wedding take place "when I old enough." This set her fits laughing; regained her good spirits, she declared "she would not have, no, young squire himself, unless he eddicated accordingly;" this, evident could brought good offices tutor. And prospective tutor (though he her rival) she magnanimously favourable, whilst I, part, warmly opposed thought him. But neither her magnanimity unreasonable objections put test then. Several days passed since I Rubens "dropped in" Rectory, I one morning labouring diligently garden, I saw Mr. Andrewes, his canonical coat shoes, coming along drive, carrying something his hand puzzled me. As he came nearer, however, I perceived small wheelbarrow, gaily painted red within green without. At respectful distance behind walked Jones, carrying garden-basket full plants his head. Both wheelbarrow plants me--a present good-natured parson. He helping plant flower-roots, giving lecture sparing use wheelbarrow, father joined us, I heard say Mr. Andrewes, "I like word you, liberty." I know made think talking me. I did, however, watched anxiously, passed drive close consultation. At last I heard Mr. Andrewes say-- "The afternoon would suit best; say hour luncheon." This remark closed conversation, came back me. But I overheard another sentence Mr. Andrewes' lips, filled disquiet, "I know one suit you; capital little fellow." So tutor actually decided upon. "'A capital little fellow.' That means nasty fussy little man!" I cried myself. "I hate him!" For rest day, next, I worried thoughts new tutor. On following morning, I standing near one lodges father, looking silver pheasants, Mr. Andrewes rode by, called father. Now, living I did, chiefly servants, spending much leisure desirable stables housekeeper's room, sense honour certain subjects quite delicate ought been. With many merits, uneducated people servants not--as class--strict ideas absolute truthfulness honourable trustworthiness matters. A large part plans, hopes, fears, quarrels uneducated people founded overheard folk intended hear it, told matter told confidence. Nothing surer mark good breeding careful "upbringing" (as Scotch call it) delicacy little points trusted one's honour. But refinement matters easily blunted one lives much people think little meanness fair found out. I really saw harm trying overhear I could conversation father Mr. Andrewes, though I aware, manner, I meant hear it. I lingered near father, therefore, pretended watching pheasants, certain instinct made feel I like father see listening. He one highly, scrupulously honourable gentlemen, whose face impossible say anything unworthy mean. He spoke low tones, I lost he said; parson's voice peculiarly clear one, though he lowered it, I heard good deal. "I saw yesterday," Mr. Andrewes' first remark. ("That is tutor," thought I.) My father's answer I lost; I caught fragments Mr. Andrewes' next remarks, full information important matter. "Quite young, good-tempered--little boy fond him, nothing would induced part him; going abroad." Which sounded well; I suspected parson good deal officious advice long sentence, I caught words, "Cannot begin early." I felt convinced, too, I heard something "use whip," put fever indignation. Just Mr. Andrewes riding off, father asked question, reply was--"Gray." My head full tutor I could enjoy stroll father usual, sorry get back Nurse Bundle, I confided I heard future teacher. "He is nasty little man," said I, "not nice tall gentleman like Papa Mr. Andrewes. And Mr. Andrewes saw yesterday. And Mr. Andrewes says he is young. And he says he is good-natured; makes use whips? And his name Mr. Gray. And he says little boy fond him, I do not believe it," I continued, breaking point tears, "and they have gone abroad (sobs) I wish--boohoo! boohoo--they would taken _him_!" With trouble Nurse Bundle found meaning rather obscure speech. Her wrath thought whip connection her darling quite great own. But she persisted taking hopeful view Mr. Gray, trusting loyally father's judgment, she succeeded softening grief time. When I came dessert evening I pretended quite happy comfortable, nothing mind. But happily children clever pretending true, I constantly thinking "that dreadful tutor," puzzling scraps conversation I heard see anything could made them, father soon found something amiss. "What matter, Regie?" he asked. "Nothing, Father," I replied, poor imitation cheerfulness approach truth. "My dear boy," said father, frowning slightly (a thing I always dreaded), "do say untrue, reason. If want tell troubles you, say, 'I would rather tell you, please,' like man, I persecute it. But do not say nothing matter little head quite full something bothers much. As I said, I press you, I love you, wish help every way I can, I think better tell me." Now, though I really thought I wrong listening conversation I meant hear, _something_ one calls conscience made feel ashamed whole matter. I feeling wrong, apt make one vexed fretful, this, quite much fear grave father, made colour rush face, tears eyes. "Come, Regie," he said, "out it. Do not cry, whatever do; that is like baby. Have something wrong? Tell it. Confession half way forgiveness. Do not afraid me. For heaven's sake, do not afraid me!" added father, impatient sadness, frown deepening rapidly his face tears flowed proportion. (How sad helpless struggles widowed father young children, I could appreciate. How seldom successful alternative second marriage, become proverbial excess truth.) My father patient many men. He dismiss tears nursery despair. With insight tenderness mother he restrained himself, unknitting his brows, held his hands said kindly, "Come tell poor Papa it, darling." On I jumped chair, rushing him, threw arms his neck sobbed out, "Oh, Papa! Papa! I do not want him." "Do not want _whom_, boy?" "M-m-m-m-r. Gray," I sobbed. "And earth Mr. Gray, Regie?" inquired perplexed parent. "The tutor--the new tutor," I explained. "But _whose_ new tutor?" cried distracted gentleman, whose confusion seemed way lessened I added, "Mine, Papa; one you are going get me." And gleam intelligence yet brightened his puzzled face, I added, doubtfully, "You going get one, are not you, Papa?" "What put idea head, Regie?" asked father, pause. And I explain, feeling uncomfortable I so, I overheard words Rectory, words lodge, I patched hearsays together made certain little man coming tutor, previously tutor somewhere else, his name Gray. And time father help bit word sign. By time I got end story I heard, I guessed, Nurse Bundle I made out, I need one tell listen one intended hear thing ashamed of. My cheeks ears red, I felt small indeed. "Now, Regie," said father, "I will not say I think listening Mr. Andrewes me, order find I choose tell you. You shall tell think, boy. Do think nice thing, gentlemanly thing, upright, honest, worthy Papa's son, sneak listening meant hear. Now do not begin cry, Reginald," he added, rather sharply; "you nothing cry for, it is either silly ill-tempered whimper I show you have done wrong. Anybody may wrong; think have, say you are sorry, like man, do not more." I made strong effort restrain tears shame vexation, said heartily-- "I am sorry, Papa. I did not think it is wrong." "I quite believe that, boy. But see it is right now, do not you?" "Oh yes!" I exclaimed, "and I will not listen more, father." We made lovingly, Rubens flying frantically heads join kisses reconciliation. He anxiously watching us, well aware something amiss. "I do not mean tell Mr. Andrewes I _were_ talking about," said father, "because I wish hear. But I tell made bad guess secret. We talking tutor, dreaming one, vexed nothing. However, I think serves right listening. But will not talk more." I think Nurse Bundle disposed blame much I blamed myself; she invariably loyal father's decisions, never magnified her indulgence nursery pitying I got scrapes drawing-room. "My dear," said she, "your Pa's gentleman, every inch him. You listen him, try he does, you will grow another, pride blessing you." But rejoiced rate fears unfounded reference much-dreaded Mr. Gray. CHAPTER XVI THE REAL MR. GRAY--NURSE BUNDLE REGARDS HIM WITH DISFAVOUR My feelings may therefore "better imagined described" when, ten of the clock following morning, father called downstairs, said, odd expression his face, "Regie, Mr. Gray come." Not one instant I mind accuse father deceiving me. My faith implicit he well deserved be. Black might white, two two might make five, impossible things might possible, father could wrong. It evident I must misunderstood last night. I looked crestfallen indeed. My father, however, seemed particularly cheerful, even inclined laugh, I thought. He took hand went front door, heart beating wildly, I delicate unrobust lad yet, far easily upset excited. More like girl, fact, comparison insult sturdy maids Cousin Polly. Outside found man-servant bay horse, holding little white pony, which, I supposed, little tutor riding. But he seen. I tried hard manly calm, much struck appearance pony, who, I came steps, turned towards gentlest intelligent faces, splendid long curly white forelock streaming his kind dark eyes, I asked-- "Is Mr. Gray's pony, father?" "What think it?" said father. "Oh, it is little dear," emphatic answer, pony unmistakably turned his head me, I met his friendly advances going him, another moment arms round his neck, he rubbing his soft, strong nose shoulder, kissing fondling happy forgetfulness everything sudden friendship, whilst man-servant (apparently Irishman) firing ejaculations like crackers fifth November. "Sure, now, ever anyone see like--just look baste--sure he knows it is young squire entirely. Och, young gintleman's well acquainted horses myself--sure he would make friends unicorn, animal; it is unicorn would proud let him, too!" "It used boys, I think?" said father. "Ye may say that, yer honour. It likes boys better man, woman, child, it is every baste ye say for." "A good many beasts reason think differently, I fear," said father. "And _that's_ true word honour ever spoke," assented groom. Meanwhile possible ground consolation beginning suggest mind. "Will Mr. Gray keep his pony here?" I asked, "The pony live here," said father. "Oh, think," I asked, "do think, I good, lessons well, Mr. Gray sometimes let ride him? He _is_ darling!" By I meant pony, Mr. Gray. My father laughed, put his hand shoulders. "I teasing you, Regie," he said. "You know I told tutor case. Mr. Andrewes I talking pony, Mr. Andrewes said _grey_, he spoke colour pony, anybody's name." "Then pony yours?" I asked. My father looked eager face pleased smile. "No, boy," he said, "he yours." The wild delight I received announcement, way I jumped danced, Rubens jumped danced me, gratitude father's satisfaction, renewed amenities pony, his obvious knowledge fact I his master, running commentary Irishman, I attempt describe. The purchase pony indeed one father's many kind thoughts welfare amusement. My odd pilgrimage Rectory search change society, pettish complaints dulness monotony home I urged account freak "dropping in," seemed without certain serious foundation. Except walks farm him, stolen snatches intercourse grooms, dogs, horses stables (which he Nurse Bundle discouraged), I little amusement proper boy age. I well content sit Rubens Mrs. Bundle's apron-string, I was, use expressive word, _moped_. My father taken counsel Mr. Andrewes, end I found master charming ponies, exciting prospect learning ride. The thought invigorated me. Before Irish groom went away I asked new steed "could jump." I questioned father's men earliest age young gentlemen ever allowed go hunting, within knowledge. I went bed dream rides wild Mazeppa's, hairbreadth escapes, feats horsemanship would amazed Mr. Astley. And hopes schemes wild I dared bring test father's ridicule, I poured pride Nurse Bundle's sympathetic ear. Dear, good, kind Nurse Bundle! She indeed mother me, mother's anxieties disappointments her portion. The effect her watchful constant care early years me, whatever good health manners. The effect her was, I believe, she never thoroughly happy I her sight. In circumstances, seemed hard infantile diseases over, I becoming intelligent (the best company possible, Mrs. Bundle declared), I wore clothes reasonably, exchanged cries exercise one's lungs infancy rational conversation nursery fireside, I drawn away nurse nursery almost entirely. It right natural, hard. Nurse Bundle felt so, she never complained. When she felt most, she said, "It is be." And was. Boys ducklings must wander time, mothers hens never kind! The world wide, duck-ponds deep. The young ones must go alone, tremble safety cannot follow take care them. I really shrink realizing Nurse Bundle must suffered whilst I learning ride. The novel exercise, stimulus risk, "put new life me," her many daily grounds sad probability death. "Every blessed afternoon I look see brought home shutter, his precious neck broken, poor lamb!" she exclaimed one afternoon, overpowered sight climbing pony's back, performance I brought her downstairs witness, endeavoured render entertaining creditable secretly stimulating pony restlessness, hopping one foot stirrup, I fancied knowing manner. "Why, dear Mrs. Bundle," said father, smiling, "you kill least three hundred sixty-four times oftener course year need. If he break his neck, he once, bewail his loss every day." "Now, Heaven bless young gentleman, sir, meaning disrespect, do not ye go tempt Providence joking it, perhaps brought hopeless corpse side door evening," said Mrs. Bundle, her red cheeks absolutely blanched vision she conjured up. Why, I cannot say, she fully made her mind I brought home dead, she believed that, sooner later, I pretty sure be, I brought side-door. Now "the side-door," called, little door leading garden, less used, perhaps, door house. Mrs. Bundle, I believe, decided tragedy she constantly rehearsing, men find body would avoid front-door, spare father sudden shock meeting corpse. The side-door, too, nursery windows. Mrs. Bundle herself, would, probably, first hear knocking it, she naturally pictured herself taking prominent part terrible scene she often fancied. It perhaps good thing, whole, she chose door preference constant use, otherwise every ring knock front back door must added greatly her anxieties. I fear I much relieve them. I rather aggravated them. Partly I believe conceit showing skill daring, partly way "hardening" Mrs. Bundle's nerves. When knowledge, longer custom, stronger health nerves, placed us beyond certain terrors afflict people, apt fancy that, insisting upon submitting mind, nervous friends ought forced unconcern feel ourselves; is, perhaps, little like dosing patient happens agree doctor. Thus I fondled pony's head dawdled ostentatiously his heels Nurse Bundle full fears his biting kicking. But I feel sure this, tricks I played show firmness "seat," made seem her certain that, recklessness, I must day bitten, kicked, thrown. I several falls, one two narrow escapes serious accidents, which, moment, made father white Mrs. Bundle. But he wise enough know present risks I ran fearlessness nothing future risks complete confidence horseback would ensure me. And ordinary mishaps, days hours unspeakable healthy happiness, I learnt ride well know horses. And poor Mrs. Bundle, sitting safely home her rocking-chair, endured fears I free. "Now look, deary," said she one day; "do not go turning sweet face round look nursery windows you are riding off. I see curls, bless them! that is enough me. Keep still, love, look you are going, reason you have plenty that. And do not go waving precious hand, gives turn think you have let go, got one hand hold with, turning corner too, pony shaking tail, shifting back legs, till do not slip one side passes altogether." "Why, do not think I hold hands, you?" I cried. "And hold with?" said Mrs. Bundle. "Many's light cart I have rode in, never let go hold, unless one hand, save bag bandbox. And though it is jolting, I am sure light cart's nothing pony-back starts unexpectedness." I tried vain make Nurse Bundle like pony. "I have seen plenty ponies!" she said, severely; she meant she seen many, she seen enough. "My brother-in-law's first cousin one--a little red-haired beast--as vicious wild cat. It many races, death last, according expectations everybody. He brought home shutter his family, pony grazing close ditch nothing happened. Many's time I have seen expecting death little yourself, he refused twenty pound Tuesday fortnight he killed. But I his wife that is his widow body brought." By time I heard anecdote I happily good rider frightened it; I wish Mrs. Bundle's relative died death formed melancholy precedent her mind. The strongest obstacle, however, chance nurse's looking favour new pet her profound ignorance horses ponies general. Except colour length tail, she recognized difference one another. As distinctions "play" "vice," fidgety animal determined kicker, friendly nose-rub malicious resolve bite, discernible Mrs. Bundle's unaccustomed eyes. "I have seen plenty ponies," she would repeat; "I know are, dear," she invariably followed statement rehearsing fate her brother-in-law's cousin, sometimes adding-- "He much giving racing, horses. He little man, suffered deal quinsies autumn." "What pity he did not die quinsy instead breaking his neck!" I felt compelled say one day. "He might lived done had not pony," said Mrs. Bundle emphatically. CHAPTER XVII I FAIL TO TEACH LATIN TO MRS. BUNDLE--THE RECTOR TEACHES ME I soon discover whole father's plans Mr. Andrewes benefit. Not decided I pony, learn ride, also settled I go daily Rectory "do lessons" Rector. I greatly pleased. I already begun Latin father, vainly endeavoured share educational advantages Mrs. Bundle, teaching her first declension. "Musa, amuse," she repeated occasion. "Musae, muse," I continued. "_Of amuse!_ There is sense that, dearie," said Mrs. Bundle; ideas well defined subject muses, Mrs. Bundle's even less genders, numbers, cases, I reluctantly gave her decision "Latin well young gentlemen, good plain English best suited likes her." She greatly delighted, however, Latin valentine I prepared her ensuing 14th February, caused delivered housemaid, envelope old stamp, postmarks made pen penny. The design simple; heart traced outline peppermint lozenge shape, came ounce "mixed sweets" village shop. The said heart painted red I wrote largest clearest handwriting, _Mrs. B. Amo te_. When Latin translated her, her gratification great. At first she put two Latin words three English ones, she got difficulty last always reading thus:-- "A mo te, I love thee." My Latin advanced much beyond stage I began go Mr. Andrewes every day. Thenceforward I progressed rapidly learning. Mr. Andrewes good scholar, (quite another matter) good teacher; I fancy I wanting quickness willingness work. But Latin, arithmetic, geography, marvellous improvement he soon made handwriting, small parts indeed I owe good friend childhood. I suppose that--other things equal--children learn love best, I soon found I object strangely strong affection new teacher. The chief I know, learnt death put end, life, happy intercourse. But I child's complacent appreciation fact I favourite, strength I haunted Rectory hours, confident welcome. I turned Rector's books, culled his flowers, joined his rides, made tell stories, tyrannized docile playfellow fashion astonished many grown-up people awed repelled his reserve eccentricities, never knew his character I knew till he could known more. But I fancy worthy men who, shy reserved, intimately known children love. I may say I owe much mere learning Mr. Andrewes, regular lessons small part even his teaching. "It always seems me," he said one day, father I together Rectory, "that two kinds learning neglected education young. Religious knowledge, which, all, concerns worthiest part every man, longest share his existence (to say nothing matters now); knowledge call Nature, laws concern bodies, rule conditions life world. It is hobby mine, Mr. Dacre, I am afraid I ride hobbies rather like witch broomstick. But man must deal according his lights his conscience; I intrusted lad's education while, duty pleasure instruct religious lore natural science, far his age allows. To teach know his Bible (and I wish leisure taught read Scriptures original tongues). To teach know his Prayer-book, history. Something, too, history his Church, faith better men us proud live, even dared die." When Rector became warm conversation, his voice betrayed rougher accent commonly heard, excited he became broader his speech. It got broad point, father broke in. "I trust entirely you, sir," he said; "but, pardon me, I confess I fond religious prodigies--children quote texts teach elders duty; Reginald quite sufficient tendency towards over-excitement brain subjects." "I quite agree you," said Mr. Andrewes. "I think may trust me. I know well childhood, like states times ignorance, liable conceit egotism, foster religious self-importance easy, modesty moderation slowly taught. But youth time one specially apt self-conceited, surely, Mr. Dacre, also first, easiest, purest, zealous learn seldom learned good time." "I dare say right," said father. "People talk horror attacks faith sadly characteristic age," said Rector, walking study, seemingly forgetful presence, father's, "(which, by-the-bye, said every age turn), I fear real evil fixed faith attacked. It old, old story. From within, without. The armour early put on, grown growth, strength time trial, support sorrow, given grace joy, quickly discarded journals say old-fashioned worn-out. Life short every man prove his faith theoretically, given prove practical value experience, method proof cannot begun soon." "Very true," said father. "I do not know man's religious belief (which course ground his religious life) supposed come without trouble learning, body truths principles people act," Mr. Andrewes went on. "And yet religious instruction young people educated classes receive rule?--especially boys, girls get hold books, pick faith somehow, though often enough make miserable 'unsettled,' more. I often wonder," he added, sitting table laugh, "whether mass educated men know less concerns welfare souls, therewith connected, mass educated women concerns bodies, _therewith_ connected. I feel sure ignorances produce untold dire evil!" "So theology natural science Regie's first lessons?" said father, drawing him. "I have talking stilts, I know," said Mr. Andrewes, smiling. "We will use simpler terms,--duty GOD, duty Man. One cannot either without learning how, Mr. Dacre." I repeat conversation I heard father, since I grew could understand it. Mr. Andrewes' educational theories duly put practice benefit. In his efforts religious education, Nurse Bundle proved unexpected ally. When I repeated her solemn truth his reverent simple manner he explained me; tale he told good man, whose example followed; bit quaint practical advice he given me, perhaps hymn I learned his side, delight good old soul knew bounds. She said good sermon; she particularly fond sermons, compliment. She used beg carefully remember anything kind I heard, I repeated it, she generally her word advice add, wonderful tales point moral,--tales happy unhappy deathbeds, warnings, judgments, answers prayer. Tales, too, charities poor, happiness afflicted, triumphs deeply tempted, good wealthy, healthy, well-cared-for, listen to. Nurse Bundle's religious faith tinge superstition; Mr. Andrewes enlightened. But matter every-day life, hope fear, sorrow joy, plan, word deed, could separated. And however imperfectly, became me. Like children, I rather vivid idea day judgment. The thought death familiar me. (It seldom, I think, painful one childhood.) I fully realized couplet concluded certain quaint old rhyme honour four Evangelists Nurse Bundle taught repeat bed-- "If I die I wake, I pray Lord soul take." I used recite similar one I dressed morning-- "If soul depart to-day, A place Paradise I pray." When I particularly pleasant ride, enjoyed much day, I thanked GOD specially evening prayers. I remember whatever I wished I prayed for, complete belief readiest way obtain it. And would untruth childish experience add I never remember prayed vain. I also picked certain little quaint superstitions Nurse Bundle, cling still. Neither she I ever put anything top Bible, sometimes sat long comical uncomfortable silence neither us would "scare angel passing house." When first notes organ stirred swallows church eaves chirp aloud, I believed Mrs. Bundle joining Te Deum. And sunshine fell church windows service, I regarded "a blessing." The half Mr. Andrewes' plan neglected. From I learnt (and lore thankful for) use eyes. He good botanist, his knowledge medicinal uses wild herbs ranked next his piety raise Mrs. Bundle's esteem. When "lessons" over, often rode together. As rode lanes, he taught distinguish notes birds, observe crops grow certain soils, seasons different plants flower bear fruit. He made see eyes, hear ears, I shall ever grateful him. I fancy I hear his voice now, saying his curt cutting fashion-- "How silly sounds hear anybody head his shoulders say, 'I never noticed it!' What eyes for?" If I admired creeper-covered cottage, picturesquely old tumble-down, he would ask many rooms I thought contained--if I fancied roof would keep rain snow, far I supposed convenient comfortable man his wife six children live in. In practical problems he set me, I suppose labourer, nine shillings week, found sum would come half year, write slate I would spend money, best advantage, clothing feeding two grown-up people seven children various ages. As I knew nothing cost necessaries life, I went, Mr. Andrewes' advice, Nurse Bundle help. "What beef mutton cost?" first question, I sat important air nursery table, slate hand. "Now bless dear boy's innocence?" cried Mrs. Bundle. "You may leave beef mutton, love. It is much meat family gets that is reared nine shillings week." After series calculations oatmeal-porridge, onion-potage, modest dainties, Mrs. Bundle constantly fell back "bits things garden," I said decidedly-- "They cannot clothes, it is good thinking it." "Children cannot let go bare-backed," said Mrs. Bundle, equal decision. "She must take washing. For reason, boots cannot expected come nine shillings week, many mouths feed." "She must take washing, sir," I announced resigned air, old-fashioned gravity peculiar me, I returned Rectory next day. "Boots cannot come nine shillings week." The Rector smiled. "And suppose one boys catches fever, did; cannot people's clothes house, infection. And doctor's bill pay--what then?" By time I thoroughly realized position needy family, I forgotten real case, rather, special one meant. And I begged, tears eyes, I might apply contents alms-box paying doctor's bill. Many lesson like this, oft-repeated practical remarks healthy situations, proper drainage, roomy cottages, like, engraven constant repetition mind, bore fruit years, welfare many labourers families hands. It difficult convey idea learning I gained good friend, yet show free he priggishness, always playing schoolmaster. He simply charming companions, tried raise his level, interest he knew thought himself, instead coming me, talking patronizing nonsense often supposed acceptable children. Across years parted us life I fancy times I see his grey eyes twinkling thick brows more, hear his voice, slightly rough accent, saying-- "_Think_, dear lad, _think_! Pray learn think!" CHAPTER XVIII THE ASTHMATIC OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS RIDDLES--I PLAY TRUANT AGAIN--IN THE BIG GARDEN It perhaps partly because, like children, I accustomed grown-up people, I liked way Mr. Andrewes treated me, resented different style another friend father, always bantered playful, nonsensical fashion, he deemed suitable years. The friend question old gentleman, benevolent one. I think he fond children, I sure he kind. He never came without giving half-a-guinea he left, generally slipping back neck, hiding plate dinner, burying orange. He whole store funny tricks, would amused pleased I might enjoyed peace. But he never ceased teasing me, playing practical jokes me. And worst was, he teased Rubens also. Mr. Andrewes often afterwards told day I walked Rectory--my indignant air, he vowed, faithfully copied dog heels, without preface began: "I know I ought forgive trespass us, I cannot. He put cayenne pepper Rubens' nose." In justice ourselves, I must say neither Rubens I bore malice point, added anxiety I always felt get old gentleman's way. By I put riddles puzzle childish brains turn: "If herring half cost threehalfpence," etc. And I successfully accomplished calculation, I tripped unfair problem, "If grate dimensions, coals come to?" I hear his voice (hoarse combination asthma snuff-taking) he poked jocosely unmercifully "under fifth rib," he called it, crying-- "_Ashes_! little man. D'ye see? _Ashes_! _Ashes_!" After he took snuff, nearly choked laughing chagrin. Greatly Nurse Bundle puzzled night, I stood, ready bed, fumbling hands nightshirt, expression face becoming surgeon conducting capital operation. "Bless dear boy!" she cried. "What yourself, dear?" "How he _know_ fifth rib?" I almost howled vexation. "I do not believe _was_ fifth rib! I wish I _hadn't_ fifth rib! I wish I might hurt _his_ fifth rib!" I think old gentleman would choked laughter he could seen heard me. One day, father's horror, I candidly remarked, "It always makes think first April, sir, you are here." I mean rude. It simply true succession "sells" practical jokes Rubens I victims his visits recall tricks supposed sacred Festival All Fools. To old gentleman justice, he heartily enjoyed joke his expense; laughed took snuff extra proportions, gave whole guinea instead half one, saying I go live Fools' Paradise, little pigs ran ready roasted knives forks backs; adding banter nonsense kind, utter bewilderment brain. He occasion playing truant Rectory second time. Once, he expected, I took nightshirt pillow, followed Rubens, presented Rector he sat breakfast, saying, "Mr. Carpenter coming, cannot endure it. We really cannot endure it. And please, sir, give us bed night? And I am sorry is not clean one, Nurse keeps nightgowns top shelf, I did not want her know coming." Mr. Andrewes kept hours, he persuaded return meet old gentleman, saying due his real kindness bear his little jokes; I ought try learn make allowances, "put with" things quite mind. So I went back, partly efforts less easily annoyed, partly I older his latest visit, knew riddles, could see his jokes quickly, I got well him. Very glad I afterwards I gone back spent friendly evening kind old man; following spring his asthma became worse worse, he died. That visit his last us. He teased Rubens more. But I heard his death, I felt I said, I sorry. He kind his pokes jokes trifles look back upon. Mr. Andrewes kept his interest garden. Indeed, I soon got beyond childish way gardening; I ceased use watering-pot recklessly, take plants see getting on. I promoted little beds share large flower-garden. My father fond his flowers, greatly pleased find useful. Some happiest hours I ever spent I worked "the big garden;" Rubens lying sun, keeping imaginary guard father's coat. We friendly rivalry Rectory, I felt highest interest. Sometimes, however, I helped Mr. Andrewes himself, he rewarded plants good advice. The latter often quaint rhymes, "This rule gardening never forget, To sow dry, set wet." But time, deep regret, Mr. Andrewes gave care education. He said his duties parish allow his giving much time me; though father special wish press studies, anxious benefit Rector's influence, Mr. Andrewes last persuaded he ought get resident tutor prepare public school. By time I almost forgotten foolish prejudice imaginary Mr. Gray, sorry I could longer lessons Rector. I suppose answer inquiries he made father heard gentleman wanted situation ours. He heard Leo Damer's guardian, gentleman proved tutor I seen nursery windows Aunt Maria's house. He remained Leo ever since, Leo's guardian sent school, tutor liberty. In circumstances, I felt he quite stranger, prepared receive favourably. Indeed, his arrival close hand, Nurse Bundle I took hospitable pleasure looking arrangements his room, planning little details his comfort. He came last, father able announce Aunt Maria (who never approved she called "Mr. Andrewes' desultory style teaching") education placed hands resident tutor. CHAPTER XIX THE TUTOR--THE PARISH--A NEW CONTRIBUTOR TO THE ALMS-BOX Mr. Clerke small, slight, fair man. He short-sighted, caused carry round piece glass size penny his waistcoat pocket, time time stick his eye, he held ingenious, but, seemed me, dangerous fashion. It took quite fortnight get used eye-glass. It like policeman's bull's-eye lantern. I never knew might turned me. Then glass rim, edges looked quite sharp, reckless way tutor held squeezed his cheek eyebrow thing feared admired. I sitting Delectus one morning, unwillingly working page set punishment offence, hands buried pockets, fumbling halfpence treasures concealed, when, seeing tutor stick his glass his eye he went bookcase, I pulled halfpenny try I could hold cheek brow, he held his glass. After many failures, I triumphantly succeeded he caught sight reflection mirror, seeing halfpenny eye, chin air, face puckered must comical travesty his appearance, he concluded I mimicking him, defying his authority, coming quickly he gave sharp box ear. In explanation followed, he candid enough apologize handsomely "lost his temper," he said; remitted task atonement, took fishing him. We got well together. At first I think old-fashioned ways puzzled him, he also disconcerted questions I asked together. Perhaps he understood better he came know Mr. Andrewes, learned much I him. He high respect Rector. The first walk took together call Rectory. We stayed luncheon, Mr. Andrewes conversation tutor I hear. As came home, I anxious learn Mr. Clerke think dear friend "very nice." "Mr. Andrewes remarkable man," said tutor. And he constantly repeated this. "He remarkable man." After Mr. Clerke ceased put asking strange unchildish questions he always able answer. He often said, "We ask Mr. Andrewes he thinks;" part, I respected none less he often honestly confessed he could not, off-hand, solve problems exercised brain. He good general naturalist he fond geology, kind enough take "chipping" expeditions, start "collection" fossils. I already collection flowers, collection shells, collection wafers, collection seals. (People collect monograms old stamps young days.) These collections sore vexation Nurse Bundle. "Whatever gentleman like Rector thinking of, encourage rubbish, dear," said she, "it passes me! It is vexing enough see dirt bits should not be, take dust-pan clear  them away. But dead leaves, weeds, stones road brought day day, allowed much touch them, young gentleman things worth golden guineas play with, storing lot stuff could pick rubbish-heap field it is burned--if anybody you, dear, I could not abear it. And what is tutor for, I like know?" (Mrs. Bundle, time liked blaming her darling, acquired habit laying blame misdoings mine tutor, ground he "ought seen to" acting differently.) If Mr. Clerke discovered he could confess puzzled questions, without losing ground his pupil's respect, I soon found grown-up tutor altogether outlived boyish feelings. It dimly dawned he liked holiday quite well, better myself; grew intimate many race scramble game together, bookwork day. He rode badly, courage, mishaps he managed suffer riding quietest oldest father's horses food fun well me. He told he going clergyman, Sunday afternoons commonly engaged strong religious discussions. During fruit season also custom day visit kitchen-garden luncheon, ate gooseberries, settled theological differences. There little low, hot stone seat one cucumber frames I never seat without recollections flavour little round, hairy, red gooseberries, lengthy dispute I held Mr. Clerke, began saying I looked forward meeting Rubens "in better world." I distinctly remember I could bring forward little authority belief, tutor little it, adjourned common consent Rectory take Mr. Andrewes' opinion, taste his strawberries. I feel quite sure Mr. Clerke, well myself, strongly felt Rector's influence. He often said after-years much he owed raising his aims views sacred office he purposed fill. He looked forward clergyman profession towards his education college career tended, which, he hoped, would last secure comfortable livelihood interest his patrons. But intercourse Rector gave higher tone his ideas. He would clergyman high character otherwise, he aimed holiness; he would never idle one, his wish learn much he could do, well he could much people committed his charge. He means reticent man, he liked sympathy, soon got habit confiding want better friend. Thus he began take earnest interest parish work, schemes benefit people, Sunday conversations became less controversial, gossiped schools school-treats, cricket-clubs, drunken fathers, slattern mothers, spoiled children, evening hymn "went" sermon Sunday, like district visitors parish tea-party. What visions improvement amongst fellow-creatures saw wandered amongst gooseberry-bushes, Rubens following heels, eating double share lower branches, since his mouth emptied conversation! We often got parted either us wandered towards special favourite trees. Those bearing long, smooth green gooseberries like grapes, highly-ripened yellows, hairy little reds. Then shouted bits gossip, happy ideas struck us, across garden. And full youth hopefulness, sunshine summer Sundays, gave credit clear-sightedness opinions, promised success every plan, gratitude prot√©g√©s. Mr. Andrewes started Sunday School great success (Sunday Schools novelties then), Mr. Clerke teacher. At last, great delight, I allowed take youngest class, teach letters Catechism. About time I firmly resolved parson I grew up. My great practical difficulty head I must, course, live Dacrefield, yet I could Rector. My final decision I announced Mr. Andrewes. "Mr. Clerke I always curates, work you." On tutor would sigh, say, "I wish could so, Regie, I think I shall ever like place, church, people well again." At time alms-box well filled, thanks liberality Mr. Clerke. He taxed his small income I taxed pocket-money (a different matter!), though I sure he must sometimes inconveniently poor, he never failed put his share charitable store. Some brooding matter led say one Sunday, "You I, sir, like widow people lesson to-day: I put box pocket-money, living." The tutor blushed painfully; partly, I think, accurate comprehension difference worldly lots, partly sheer modesty realizing measure his self-sacrifice. When first he began contribute, he always kept back certain sum, he regularly sent away, I never knew. He briefly explained, "It good object." But last day came he announced, "I longer call upon me." And time he put black tie, looked grave several days, I judged poor relation, dead, object his kindness. He spoke subject, he thanked led put fixed sum purposes, added, "The person I accustomed send share money said worth double regularly." CHAPTER XX THE TUTOR'S PROPOSAL--A TEACHERS' MEETING I think Mr. Clerke first suggested take Sunday scholars teachers holiday trip. Such things matters course every parish, childhood considered marvellous idea rustic population. The tutor heard extraordinarily active parson done like his schools, partly real kindness, partly spirit emulation intrudes even upon schemes benevolence, he anxious Dacrefield "be behindhand" good works. Competition feeling children great sympathy, I warmly echoed Mr. Clerke's resolve would "be behindhand." "Let us go Rectory once," said I; "Mr. Andrewes said might big yellow raspberries, must ask it. It is splendid idea. But shall go?" The matter resolved question. The Rector quite willing treat. My father gave us handsome subscription; farmers followed Squire's lead. Mr. Andrewes behindhand. The tutor I considered object suitable one aid alms-box. There difficulty whatever. Only--where go? Finally, decided would go Oakford. It Oakford end consultation long ago, illness, Nurse Bundle voice matter, certain bullet-headed, slow-tongued old farmer, one teachers, voted going Oakford; persistently repeating his advice strong reasons seemed following it, he carried day. "I have know'd Oakford, man boy, twenty year," he repeated, intervals three minutes so, would called "teachers' meeting" school-room. In fact, Oakford his native place, though he passing his old age Dacrefield, he natural desire see again, natural belief spot he young strong, light-hearted, especial merits own. Even though nothing better propose, old Giles' love home would hardly decided us, he something add. There "gentleman's place" outskirts Oakford, sometimes, absence family, "shown" public: old Giles seen boy, picture he drew glories fairly carried us away, Rector tutor excepted. They shrugged shoulders faces comical despair old man, fairly taken lead, babbled "picters," "stattys," "yaller satin cheers" grand drawing-room; whilst teachers listened open mouths, evident growing desire see Oakford Grange. I half believe old Giles' wonders, yet I wished see place myself, learn much he described us true. I supposed "the family" must home I Oakford, Mr. Mrs. Buckle would surely taken see Grange. The Rector suggested family might home now, might expedition nothing; appeared old Giles' sister's grandson see his great-uncle fortnight ago, "come Tuesday," distinctly stated family "was furrin' parts," would months come. Moreover, he said rumour place sold, nobody knew next owner would allow "shown," even his absence. Thus evident wanted see Grange, must "now never." On hearing this, fattest richest farmer (he took upper class school deference his position rather scanty education accompanied it) rose addressed Rector follows:-- "Reverend sir. I takes liberty rising addressin' you, respex Mr. Clerke, young gentleman represents Squire I have a-been tenant to, man boy, thirty year proud name it." (Murmurs applause one two farmers present, father popular.) "Reverend sir. I began bird-scaring, penny pocket, would not held coppers holes, I had, clothes would scared themselves, letting alone clappers. The Squire knows much his land I hand now, reverence acquainted years I have churchwarden. "Reverend Sir. I proud rose exertions. I never iggerantly set _my_self improvements opportoonities." (Gloom upon face teacher fourth class, objected machinery, disbelieved artificial manures.) "_My_ mottor 'as allus been, 'Never lose chance;' that is I ses occasion; 'never lose chance.'" As churchwarden backed his advice offering lend waggons horses take us Oakford, farmers would same, his speech decided matter. We wanted go Oakford, Oakford decided go. CHAPTER XXI OAKFORD ONCE MORE--THE SATIN CHAIRS--THE HOUSEKEEPER--THE LITTLE LADIES AGAIN--FAMILY MONUMENTS The expedition successful, returned safety Dacrefield; rather, I think, astonishment good-wives village, looked upon one passed parish bounds traveller, thought jaunt Oakford "venturesome" almost "tempting Providence." It curious study observe things strike different people occasions kind. It house itself, though building remarkably fine (a modern erection site old "Grange"), natural features place, though especially beautiful, roused admiration teachers scholars. Somebody said house "a deal bigger Hall" (at Dacrefield), one two criticisms passed upon timber; noble park, grand slopes, lovely peeps distance, exquisite taste displayed grounds gardens house, drew little attention party. Within, succession big rooms became confusing. One two bits certain pictures pronounced farmers "as natteral life;" "stattys" rather scandalized them, historical legends attached housekeeper various pieces furniture fell upon ears little educated interested. But got big drawing-room yellow satin chairs gave general complete satisfaction. When old Giles said, "Here be!" felt he told us justified, come Oakford vain. We stroked them, adventurous sat upon them, echoed churchwarden's remark, "Yaller satin, sure enough, backs gilded like picter-frame." I cannot think housekeeper must friends visiting her day, made arrival inconvenient tried her temper--she cross. She ran hasty account room injured tones, she resented questions, refused explanations, particularly irritable anybody strayed exact order she chose marshal us house. A vein sarcasm her remarks quite overpowered farmers. "Please stand walls. There are not need crowd spacyous rooms like these, paper are not one cheap ones spotty pattern patched matched anywhere. It come direct Indies, butterflies dragons natteral life. 'Whose picter's last room?' You kept party, young woman, you would 'ave knowed. Parties do not keep party, wants information repeated, considered another party, must pay accordingly. Next room, white door left. Now, sir, we are a-waiting you! All together, please!" But spite good lady, I generally managed linger behind, run before, look things way. Once, she rehearsing history certain picture, I made way room, catching sight pretty things open door end passage, I went see I could see. Some others following housekeeper spied them, bustled up, angrily recalling us, room, found, private _boudoir_, one shown public. In brief glance, however, I seen something made try get information housekeeper, spite her displeasure. "Who little girls picture sofa?" I asked. "Please tell me." "I gives information reference public rooms," replied housekeeper, loftily, "as duty bound; private rooms instructions." And nothing could I get her explain picture seized upon fancy. It pretty painting--a modern one. Just heads shoulders two little girls, one her face other, whose little arms round her sister's neck. I knew instant. There mistaking look decision face protecting little damsel, wistful appealing glance eyes other. The artist caught happily; though fair locks I admired uncovered, I knew little ladies beaver bonnets again. Having failed learn anything housekeeper, I went old Giles asked name gentleman place belonged. "St. John," he replied. "I suppose he got children?" I continued. "Only one living," said old Giles. "They say he have buried six,  them galloping consumptions. It stand reason they have done  them gold could buy, afflictions, sir, heavy rich man poor; body's time come are not outlandish oils furrin parts cure  them." I wondered quaint little ladies died, whether taken her "furrin parts" her death; I thought grey-eyed little maid, sad helpless her little sister must be. "Only one left?" I said mechanically. "Ay, ay," said old Giles; "and he pretty bad, I fancy. They have got furrin parts sun shines along; say he wild get back home, that will be, his coffin, laid rest big vault. Ay, ay, affliction spares none, sir, yet death." So last St. John family boy. If little ladies his sisters, must dead; not, I know were. I felt angry housekeeper her sulky reticence. I also highly pleased her manner treating me, she evidently took one Sunday-school boys. I fear partly shabby pride point led "tip" her half-a-crown account taking leave. In moment she became civil slavishness, hoped I enjoyed myself, professed her willingness show anything place day "many school children crowging putting body out, sir. There is many common people comes, sir," she added, "I am quite wored out, need service, friends a-begging leave. I stays oblige Mr. St. John." It was, I think, chiefly way I thinking aloud I said, her, "I am sure I do not know makes keep you, badly. But perhaps you are respectable." The half-crown unexpected, blow fairly took away her breath. Before her rage found words, gone. I fail call Mr. Mrs. Buckle. The shop looked I Mrs. Bundle. One would said rolls leather used stand near door. The good people delighted see me, proud introduced Mr. Andrewes tutor. I brought little presents me, Nurse Bundle, gave great satisfaction. "And Jemima?" I asked, I sat nursing imposing-looking parcel addressed her, large toilette pincushion made ready furnished pins her Mrs. Bundle herself. "Now, ever!" cried Mrs. Buckle her old style; "to think young gentleman's remembering Jemima, she married Jim Espin tinsmith six months past." So tinsmith's I went, Jemima was, she expressed it, "that pleased she did not know put herself," visit. She presented small tin lantern I made remark, pleased well. I saw drawer farthing wares also, might flat iron I minded; I old want plaything, young yet take remembrance past. I asked Mrs. Buckle two little beaver-bonneted ladies, she help much. She remember them. They might Mr. St. John's little girls; he buried four. A many ladies wore beaver bonnets then. This she could say, I gave inquiries. It way Buckles join rest party Mr. Clerke caught sight quaint little village church, churches church services matters great interest us then, two parsons, churchwarden, five elder scholars got key sexton went examine interior. It old rather dilapidated building. The glass east window squares tint consistency "bottle glass," except one fragment technically known "ruby" bore witness stained window there. There dirty calico blinds duty stained glass moderating light; dirt, long gathered, blunted sharpness tracery old carved stalls chancel, wood-worms several generations eaten fresh patterns own, squat, solemn little carved figures seemed moulder one's eyes. In body church high pews painted white, four five old tombs life-size recumbent figures fitted oddly these, skimpy looking prayer-desk, pulpit, font, squeezed together half-rotten screen stone knight armour. "Pretty tidy," said churchwarden, tapping pews patronising finger; "but bless save us, Mr. Andrewes, sir, walls disgraceful dirty, ten shillings' worth lime labour would make  them white driven snow. The sexton says rate, so, do not whitewash paint bit, get rid rotten old seats, make things bit decent? You do not find many places beat Dacrefield, sir, go far will," he added complacently, air exhausted experience matter country churches. "Them old figures," he went on, "they puts mind one father used tell us about, Dacrefield Church. A man kind cap his face, his feet crossed, pointed toes, sword his side." "At Dacrefield?" cried Mr. Andrewes; "surely is not Templar Dacrefield?" "It old church came down," continued churchwarden, "in old Squire's time. There deal ancient rubbish cleared then, sir, I have heard, laid stackyard Hall. It father employed mason 'brick mortar Benson,' called him, repairs wall, short stones, chipped figure I telling of. My father allus said he knowed head put whole, many's time I have looked boy." I think Mr. Andrewes could endure churchwarden's tale former destructiveness longer, he abruptly called us come away. I running join rest door, eye fell upon modern tablet marble large cushioned pew. Like monuments church, sacred memory members St. John family, and, I found recorded names wife six children present owner estate. Very pathetic, record desolation, words Job (cut bas-relief bottom, which, gracefully, represented broken flower): "The LORD gave, LORD hath taken away: blessed name LORD." Mr. Clerke hurrying back church fetch I read text. I time see last two names names girls, I join him. Amy Lucy. Were indeed dainty little children short time ago living, busy like myself, happy tinsmith's toys, sad drenched doll? Wild speculations floated head I followed tutor, without hearing one word he saying tea teachers, reaching Dacrefield dark. I wished brother. Supposing so, I withering family doom, homesick sick unto death "in furrin parts!" My last supposition I thought aloud: "I suppose know old knights, people ruffs, sons daughters kneeling behind them, now. That is, good, went heaven." "_Who_ suppose know people ruffs?" asked bewildered tutor. "Amy Lucy St. John," said I; "the children died last." "Well, Regie, certainly _do_ say _the_ _sin_gular things," said Mr. Clerke. But speech he often made, emphasis given here. CHAPTER XXII NURSE BUNDLE FINDS A VOCATION--RAGGED ROBIN'S WIFE--MRS. BUNDLE'S IDEAS ON HUSBANDS AND PUBLIC-HOUSES I happy Mr. Clerke's sway, yet I glad go school. The tutor himself, "on foundation" Eton, helped fill anticipations public-school life. It decided I also go Eton, oppidan, becoming already partisan part school, I often disputed conclusions questioned facts tutor's school anecdotes, commonly tended sole glorification "collegers." I must omit mention interview period took place father Mrs. Bundle. It one morning Eton matter settled, nurse presented herself father's library, her face fatter redder usual swollen inflamed weeping. "Well?" said father, looking pleasantly his accounts. But he added hastily, "Why, bless me, Mrs. Bundle, matter?" "Asking pardon troubling you, sir," Nurse Bundle began choky voice, "but made mention yourself, sir, kindness is, young gentleman good gone school, eating bread idleness ever since tutor come, I wished know, sir, thought giving notice." "Give notice what?" asked father. "To leave service, sir," said Mrs. Bundle, steadily. "There is nurse wanted establishment now, sir." My father laid one hand Mrs. Bundle's shoulder, he drew forward miniature mother always hung standing frame writing-table. "It like scrupulous," he said; "but never speak leaving us, Mrs. Bundle. Please, her sake," added father, his voice faltering he looked towards miniature. As Nurse Bundle, her tears utterly forbade her get word. "If much do," father went on, "let young girl got relieve work troubles you; or, much wish home yourself, I right refuse that, though I wish could happy roof, I see one cottages near gate. But desert me--and Reginald--after many years." "The day I leave breaking heart," sobbed Nurse Bundle, "and ways I could useful--but take wages nothing, I could not, sir." "Mrs. Bundle," said father, "if wages matter importance me, I could afford even pay work, I still ask share home, comforts I offer, help far could, sake past. I must always obligation I never repay," added father, his rather elaborate style. "And useful, well, ahem, kindly continue superintend repair linen Master Reginald's ----" "Why, bless innocence, sir, meaning disrespect," said Mrs. Bundle, "but are not mending _your_ linen. There darning tutor's socks, give away half-a-dozen pair last Monday, sir, had not darn  them bigger pea." I think allusion "giving away" suggested idea father his perplexity employing Nurse Bundle. "Stay," he exclaimed, "Mrs. Bundle, way could greatest service me. I often feel loss lady head household must especially felt among poor people around us--additionally so, Mr. Andrewes married, lady either Rectory visit sick encourage mothers children. I fear I anything often wrong way, wrong objects." "Well, sir," said Mrs. Bundle, old grievance rushing her mind, "I thought making bold speak Tommy Masden give half-crowns to, tells one big lie top another, his father drinks every penny he earns, his mother back-door along scraps, throwed Christmas soup pig, said was not come workus yet; coat good new yours, sir, hanging door pawnshop, giving turn I thought legs would never carried home, till I found you would given Tommy, will not hand's turn sixpence, begs every house parish every week comes round, tells everybody, he tells yourself, sir, he never gets nothing nobody." "Well, well," said father, laughing, "you see I want somebody look real cases distress deserving poverty. Of course, I must speak Mr. Andrewes first, Mrs. Bundle, I sure he glad neither us wife undertake." I know Nurse Bundle glad reconcile her honest conscience staying Dacrefield; I think allusion lack lady head household decided her risks remove reason second Mrs. Dacre. Moreover, duties proposed her suited her tastes shade. Mr. Andrewes delighted. And thus came that, though father would horrified idea employing Sister Mercy, though Bible-woman district visitor names familiar simple parochial machinery, Mrs. Bundle work three great benefit poor neighbours. Not, however, satisfaction hitherto leant upon charity Hall. A certain picturesquely tattered man, living distance village, habit waylaying father certain points estate, well-timed agricultural remarks cunning affectation half-wittedness good-humour, got henceforward half-crowns his pains. "Mrs. Bundle knocked pensioners," father would laughingly complain. But he quite willing half-crowns taken direct man's wife children, instead passing his hands public-house. "Though really good woman--for I understand she excellent person--is singularly hard-favoured," father added, "and looks she thrashed old Ragged Robin he beat her, I hear he does." "Nothing inside, poker outside, makes many women they have wish sit picter," said Mrs. Bundle, severely, reply remark mine, reflecting, like father's, said woman's appearance. "And woman children, father brings home nothing kicks bad language, reason is not death ruin her, makes her she 'asn't much time spirits spare dropping curtseys telling long tales like people always scrap-seeking gentry's back-doors. But I knows clean place I takes unawares, clothes patch stuff, colour washed them, bruises hid, bad husband made best of, children knows behave themselves." The warmth Mrs. Bundle's feelings prompted tease her; chiefly "the fun working her up" I said-- "Ah, but, Nurse, know heard she went one night public-house, made row everybody. I do not mean he ought go public-house, still, I am sure I would wife came hunted she thought I ought indoors, I would--well, I would try teach her stay home. Besides, women ought gentle, perhaps she sweeter-tempered him, he would kinder her." "Do know she went for, Master Reginald?" said Nurse Bundle. "Not halfpenny he give her feed children with, everything house that is got she gets washing. And rich folk she washed kept her waiting her money--more shame  them; weeks run on, she borrowed bit, pawned bit, she went day said they would pay her, he would drawed money, drinking she went see she could get any, laughed her, sent her back children starving, neighbour she would borrowed called her thief threatened her up. Gentle! why, bless innocence, ever knowed gentleness good drunkard? She stood sooner, he would never got bad. She is kept his brute ways herself made his home comfortable her earnings, till he thinks he may anything never bring nothing. She lay his behaviour day, he beat her afterwards. But me, Master Reginald, I would money feed children, I would fought I would bit breath body." And respect Nurse Bundle, I bound say I think she would good her word. "Go tutor, dear," she continued, "and talk Latin Greek like, knows about; do not talk rubbish pretty looks ways woman tied drunkard, I cannot abear it. I seed enough husbands public-houses young days keep single woman missis. Not I have feelings like folk, plenty offers, besides young cabinet-maker high wages beautifullest complexion ever saw. But he overfond company; I went service, cried sleep every night three months; next I see he staggering along street, I says, 'I am sorry see like this, William,' he says, 'It is doing, Mary; No's drove glass.' And I says, 'Then it is best is. If one No drove glass, married life would not suit, there is plenty Noes there.' So I left wiping his eyes, he always cried he beer. And I says myself, 'I will go back place, I knows I am working for, leave do not suit.' And always same, dear. If nice-looking footman, he would his evening come home fresh; elderly butler put little by, he wanted set public line. So I kept myself, dear, I am short-tempered best, could never put abuse man liquor." I thoroughly converted side Ragged Robin's wife, I pressed charity money Mrs. Bundle her benefit; I tried dispute nurse's unfavourable view husbands instancing her worthy brother-in-law Oakford. "Ah, yes, Buckle," said Mrs. Bundle, tone seemed less justice saddler's good qualities deserved. "He is good, soft, easy body, Buckle." Whence I concluded Mrs. Bundle, like ladies, altogether easy please. I think last walk village Mr. Clerke left us, he I called Ragged Robin's wife. She thankful, communicative, eyes, deep set her bony discoloured face, seemed lost power lighting hope. "My dear Regie," said Mr. Clerke, turned homewards, "I never saw anything pitiable look woman's eyes; tone she said, 'There better world afore us all, sir--I will well then,' I said I hoped she would better happier now, quite went heart. I am afraid she never much comfort world, unless she outlives her lord master. Do know, Regie, she reminds much ill-treated donkey; her bones look battered, there is sort stubborn hopelessness her like poor Neddy thwacked tugged way that, work he never hard. Poor thing, she may well look forward Heaven," added tutor, whose kind heart sore subject, "and it is blessed thought make up, even life here!" "What make donkeys?" I asked, taking Mr. Clerke disadvantage standing subject dispute us--a "better world" beasts. But tutor said, "My dear Regie, _do_ say _the_ _sin_gular things!" which, I pointed out, argument, one way another. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bundle, best Robin's wife certain ill-treated women place. Mrs. Bundle could severe dirt discomfort "drove men public would stay home clean kitchen stay in, less nagging man screaming children never made decent husband well-behaved child yet." Yet certain cases undeserved brutality, like Robin's, I fear she sometimes counselled resistance, principle "could not make worse, might make better." I sure father never thought Mrs. Bundle acting sick nurse village; matters seemed develop themselves. She experienced capable she could hardly fail smoothe disordered bed-clothes, open window, clear room shiftless gossips flocked like ravens predict death, take control mismanaged sick-rooms. It came common thing wan child present door message "Missis Bundle she wants her things, mother bad, she says she will see her night." As herself, I doubt she ever happier her life. Her conscience ease, she certainly worked hard enough her wages, good see glow pleasure oft-repeated remark father's never failed bring her honest face. "Do not overwork yourself, Mrs. Bundle. What laid up?" CHAPTER XXIII I GO TO ETON--MY MASTER--I SERVE HIM WELL I went joyfully school first time, succeeding half less less willingness. And yet school-days happy ones, especially look back upon. "You tutor's house Lionel Damer," said father; "and I written ask befriend you." "Just sort idiotic thing parents do," said Sir Lionel, first meeting. "You may thank stars I do not pay it." Leo grown much taller since met, he lost none his beauty. I overpowered his noble appearance air authority he wore, gave hero-worship heart. It thrill delight I heard add, "However, I want fag, I dare say I take you. Any sock you?" "Oh, yes, Leo," said I, hastily; "a big hamper. And two cakes, pigeon pie, lots jam, macaroons turnovers, two bottles raspberry vinegar." "My name's Damer," said Leo. "Can cook?" "Not yet, Damer," said I, hoping answer conveyed willingness learn. For I quite prepared duties fag life Mr. Clerke's descriptions. And I prepared perform them, pending time I fag own. I must Leo justice. His tyranny merciful. I soon expert preparing his breakfast. I used fetch hot dishes shop. My cooking good, I made, he said, execrable coffee, led fling contents pot one morning, ruining shirt, trickling hot wet body clothes, giving infinite trouble cleaning his carpet. (As _his_ coffee, salad dressing he made, his cooking generally, he chose it, I never met anything like since. However, things taste well one's school-days.) Leo Damer one people seem able everything little better his neighbours, without attaining overwhelming superiority one line. The masters always complained he much school he might done, yet he stood well them. His conduct highest. I may say that, knowing intimately boyhood youth, I able assert his moral conduct always "without reproach." His freedom vice, tight hand he kept me, lived admire imitate him, benefit manifold temptations school-life I never forget. His self-respect amounted self-esteem, his love people's good opinion failing, he refined fastidiousness; I think characteristics helped towards exceptional character he bore. A keen sensitiveness pain discomfort, considerable natural indolence, tended keep scrapes adventurous spirit led many reckless boys. He never flogged, he said he never would be. "I would drown sooner," he said me. And dark touch wanting complete hero's portrait, given terrible threat, I put full faith. He dandy, his dressing-table plague life. Well I remember breaking invaluable toilette preparation it, fit rage he flung broken bottle head. He sorry his first wrath past, he bound head, gave pound sausages, superbly bound copy Young's "Night Thoughts," I still possess. I also retain white scar one eyes, common least eight every ten men I know. "Do ever hear cousin?" Sir Lionel asked one day careless tones. "Polly writes sometimes," said I. "You show next letter get," said Sir Lionel condescendingly; I accordingly did, thenceforward he saw letters her. I soon clever enough discover Leo liked asked his old friends, receive messages them, led write Polly, begging her always send "nice messages" Sir Lionel, he would treat well, perhaps give his smoked bacon breakfast. Her reply characteristic: "MY DEAR REGIE,--" I shall not send nice messages Leo. I sorry showed letter I said he handsome. Handsome handsome does, he treats badly he ugly, I hate him. If he does not give bacon, he is mean. You may tell I say. "I affectionate cousin, "POLLY." I obliged hide letter Leo; he asked I heard Polly I could lie him, he sent Coventry withholding letter. I bore day half his silence neglect; I could endure longer, showed letter. He less angry I expected. He coloured laughed, called little fool writing stuff Polly, said her answer like her. Then he gave bacon, good friends again. But seal friendship certain occasion I saved flogging he ever threatened. He unjustly believed concerned insolent breach certain orders, sentenced flogging really due another lad he proud betray. He would even condescend remonstrate boy meanly allowing suffer, betrayed his anguish matter little I doubt real culprit (who never week unflogged himself) idea punishment poor Leo. He hid us all; evening I got his room, I found him, pale silent, putting things little bag. "Little one!" he cried, "I know keep secret. I want help off. I am going run away." "Oh Damer!" I cried; "but supposing you are caught; it will much worse then." "They will not catch me," he said, his lip quivering. "I disguise myself. And I shall never come back till I am man. My guardian would bring again. He thinks man hardly gentleman unless he well flogged his youth. Look old fellow, I have left everything you. Keep mischief I have shown how, and--and--you will tell Polly I was not blame." I weeping bitterly. "Dear Damer," said I, "you cannot disguise yourself. Anybody would know you; you are good-looking. Damer," I added abruptly, "did ever pray things? I used home, know, always came true. Wait me, I will back soon," I concluded, rushing room, I flung knees, prayed heart averting this, young mind, terrible tragedy. I dared stay long, knowing Leo might do, stairs I met real culprit, house. To day I remember amusement flood speech which, excitement, I overwhelmed him. I painted his meanness darkest colours, universal contempt his friends. I made hero he took his burden his back. I dwelt forcibly Leo's bitter distress superior generosity. I bribed confess many-weaponed pocket-knife (the envy house). I darkly hinted threat "blabbing" myself, meanness telling tales would nothing his allowing Leo suffer his fault. Which argument prevailed I shall never know. I fancy Leo's distress knife them, he good-natured greedy. He told truth great effort, took his flogging complete indifference. Thenceforward Leo I brothers. He taught sketch, kept divers pets together, fused botanical collections. He cooked unparalleled dishes us, read poetry aloud exquisite justness delicacy taste I never heard surpassed. His praise nectar me. When he said, "I tell what, Regie, you have uncommon lot general information, I tell you," head quite turned. Whatever he seemed right me. When I first came school, hat duly peppered pickled boys replaced one unexceptionable shape. My shirts gave offence new master. "I suppose," he said, surveying deliberately, "a good many things made Mrs. Baggage?" "Nurse Bundle makes shirts, Damer," said I. "It is same," said Damer. "I knew connected _parcel_ somehow. Well, _Package_ patterns pretty, doubt, I think it is time properly rigged out." Which duly done; holidays came scandalized Mrs. Bundle asked I done "with bran-new fine linen shirts," "them rubbishing cotton rags" come I brought place, I could inform her, feeble imitation Leo's lofty coolness, I used first clean Damer's lamp, second "correct thing." One day I said him, "I do not know why, Damer, always make think vision one Greek heroes I see walking playing-fields." I believe simply-spoken compliment deeply gratified him; he said, like Mr. Clerke, "You _do_ say oddest things, little 'un!" CHAPTER XXIV COLLECTIONS--LEO'S LETTER--NURSE BUNDLE AND SIR LIONEL If Nurse Bundle hoped I went school end would put "collections" troubled her tidy mind, she much deceived. Neither Leo I bookworms, means devoted boys games athletics. But collections kinds fancy almost amounted mania. Our natural history manias respective directions came upon us like fevers. We "sickened" sight somebody else's collection, reading butterflies, birds' eggs, water-plants, case might be. When "the complaint" "at height," lived specimens; gave leisure, sleep, pocket-money collection; made notes memoranda grammars lexicons classical reference. We sent letters country newspapers never appeared, asked questions met reply. We apt, also, recover attacks, leaving Nurse Bundle burdened boxes folios dry, dusty broken fragments plants insects, touch, she strictly forbidden destroy. We pursued fancies holidays. I letter I got Damer fourth half: "London. "MY DEAR REGIE,-- "_Eureka_! What think? My poor governor collected moths. I bullied guardian till he let collection. Such specimens! No end foreign ones know nothing about, I case made. I found little book his notes in. We quite sea go flaring nets bruising specimens. The way dig chrysalises. Mind do; I envy you! For I horrid town, I long grubbing roots trees. Polly quite agrees me. She hates London; says happiest time her life she Dacrefield. My comfort go old bookstalls look books moths butterflies. Imagine! The day aunt out, I took Polly me. She said she would give anything earth go. So went. We went awful streets, oysters stall, came back carrying end books; got door aunt Lady Chelmsfield coming out. What rage aunt in! I tried take blame, she shut Polly fortnight. It is beastly shame, Polly says expedition worth it; her spirit splendid. I never wrote long letter life before, I blues, one talk to. I wish poor governor lived. I wish I country. I wish aunt moth. Would not I pin her cork! Mind work old Mother Hubbard sumptuous provision grub next half, do not forget grubs. Would I could dig thee them. _Vale_! "Thine ever, "LIONEL DAMER." Of course ended Leo's invited Dacrefield. He came, and, wonderful relate, got Polly too. My father invited her aunt visit us, came. As Leo said, Aunt Maria "behaved better expected." Indeed, Leo reason complain her treatment rule, he constantly Ascotts' house his holidays. And rambled scrambled together, Leo, Polly, I. And added largely collections, made fernery (the Rector helping us), rode country, thoroughly happy. We generally went nursery short time dressing dinner, teased coaxed Mrs. Bundle, ate large slices excellent species gingerbread called "parliament," she kept tin case cupboard. In return entertained her marvellous "tales school," rousing her indignation terrible narratives tyrannous cruel fagging, taking away her breath tales reckless daring, amusing impudence, wanton destructiveness common boys. Some afterwards confessed fables, told--as politely put it--to "see much she _would_ swallow." After dinner expected sit father Aunt Maria drawing-room. Then, also, poor Polly expected "give us little music," dutifully went performances certainly remarkable example much acquired way mechanical musical skill real feeling art absent. After politely offering turn leaves her music, Polly always declined (it key-note her energetic character she "liked everything herself"), father generally fell asleep. I whiled away time playing Rubens table, Aunt Maria "superintended" music way must made less stolid performer nervous, Leo apt try distract Polly's attention grimaces pantomime far respectful nature behind Aunt Maria's back. Sir Lionel favourite Nurse Bundle. I unfortunate enough give her prejudice him, nothing seemed wear out. Thinking his real, affected mistake her name good joke, strongest relish admiration his school-boy wit, I told Nurse Bundle his various versions her name; tried convey her comic nature scenes hat pickled, Leo condemned home-made shirts. But quite vain. Nurse Bundle's sense humour (if she any) moved things touched mine. She looked upon destruction hat shirts "a sinful waste," Leo's jokes-- "Called baggage, he?" said indignant Mrs. Bundle. "I will Sir Lionel I get chance. At time life, too!" And explanation amended matters. By time Leo come, Nurse Bundle somewhat recovered insult, he never favourite her. He "chaffed" her freely, Mrs. Bundle liked treated respect. Still fascination his beauty his jokes even she always proof. I seen her laugh fetch parliament box Leo followed her like dog walking hind legs, wagging old piece rope end his jacket tail, singing-- "Good Mother Hubbard, Pray what is cupboard? Could give poor dog bone?" And he got parliament he would "sit up" balance slice gingerbread his nose, till Polly I cheered delight, Rubens became frantic mockery his performances, Mrs. Bundle complained "Sir Lionel never knowed let nonsense be." But I think she something like housemaid "did bedrooms," complained bitterly additional trouble given Leo Dacrefield, equally pathetic dulness Hall returned school. "The young gentlemen deal trouble, keep bit life place, sure enough." CHAPTER XXV THE DEATH OF RUBENS--POLLY'S NEWS--LAST TIMES When one reached certain age time seems go fast. Then, also, one begins understand meaning terms "the uncertainty life," "changes," "loss friends," "partings," "old times," etc., ring sadly ears grown-up folk. After first half Eton, universal experience became mine. There never holiday time I find change; and, often, loss meet return. One first bitterest death Rubens. I anxious get home, yet somehow, less high spirits usual, made feel unnatural father's face unusually grave he came meet me. "I bad news you, dear boy," he said. "I fear, Regie, poor Rubens dying." "He have a-dying day, sir," said groom, stood last Rubens' side. "But he seems he could not go peaceable till come." He seemed gone. The beautiful curls limp tangled. He lay his side his legs stretched out; his eyes closed. But I stooped cried "Ruby!" his flabby ears pricked, he began struggle. "It is fit," said groom. But nothing kind. Rubens knew he about, last actually got his feet, when, swaying feebly moment, he staggered direction (he could see) literally fell arms, one last wag his dear tail. "They say care killed cat," said Mrs. Bundle, I went nursery, "but could cure dog, deary, dog would alive now. I never see Squire put since fever. He five of the clock morning, groom says, putting stuff corners mouth silver teaspoon, he have cow doctors see him, Dr. Gilpin he have every day, Mr. Andrewes same. And I would like know, deary, could done sick Christian doctor parson daily till he dies?" "A Christian would buried churchyard," said I; "and I wish poor dear Rubens could." But he could not, I made his grave churchyard wall skirted grounds Hall. "Perhaps, day, churchyard enlarged," I explained Rector, puzzled choice burying-place, "and Rubens _get taken in_." My father anxious get another pet. I might dog kind. Dogs priceless breeds, dogs sporting, ratting, petting; dogs use ornament. From bloodhound mastiff almost large enough ride, toy poodle would go pocket--I might chosen worthy successor Rubens, I could not. "I shall never care dog," I rash enough declare. But resolve melted away one day sight soft, black ball, like lump soot, arrived game-bag, proved retriever pup. He grew charming dog, much wisdom amiability. I called Sweep. Thus half half, holidays holidays, changes, ceaseless changes went on. Births, deaths, marriages furnished father "news" his letters I away, Nurse Bundle gossip I came back. I heard also intervals Polly. Uncle Ascott's wealth increased yearly. The girls grew up. Helen "was becoming Tractarian peculiar," annoyed Aunt Maria exceedingly. Mr. Clerke got curacy London, preached earnest sermons, Aunt Maria hoped would Helen good. Mr. Clerke worked hard, seemed like it; he said his happiest days Dacrefield days. "I quite agree him," Polly added. Then came letter:--"Oh, dear Regie, fancy! Miss Blomfield married. And whom, think? Do remember old gentleman sent us cinder-parcel? Well, it is him; he really jolly old man; thinks one world like Miss Blomfield. He told her he carefully observing her conduct affairs daily life eight years. My dear Regie, _fancy_ waiting eight years one's next door neighbour, one quite old begin with! You idea much younger better she looks home her own, handsome silk dress. Can fancy her always apologising happy? She thinks she much happiness, idle, knows what. It makes feel quite ill, Regie, she idle, much happiness, I, I had? Do remember days proposed religious? I sure it is way happy: I mean happy _always_, _underneath_. Leo says great mistake _too_ religious, people ought keep extremes, make ridiculous. But I think he is wrong. For seems heap people little religious never get good it. It is not enough make happy whatever happens, it is enough make uncomfortable play cards Sunday. I know I wish I really good, like Miss Blomfield, Mr. Clerke, Helen. * * *" It year Miss Blomfield's marriage Ragged Robin's wife died. We quite looked forward peace she would enjoy she widow, known delirium tremens surely shortening her husband's life. But she died him. Her children wonderfully provided for. They girls, Hall turns sort sub-kitchenmaid capacity, progressed higher offices, became first-class servants, "did well." "My dear," said Nurse Bundle, "there are not difficulty finding homes gals brought clean, they are bid. It is folk cannot thing set  them, take care thing gives  them, there is providing for." I almost shrink recording hardest, bitterest loss changeful years school-life brought me--the death Mr. Andrewes. It holidays, yet I he died. I think I noticed anything unusual beforehand. He well months, thought little it, he never dwelt upon himself. I fifth form time, almost grown up. Sweep middle-aged dog, wisest handsomest his race. The Rector always dined us Sunday, one evening he excused himself, saying he felt unwell come out, would prefer stay quietly home, especially he journey him; he going next day visit his brother Yorkshire change. But he asked father would spare come spend evening instead. I rightly considered Sweep included invitation, went together. As went drive (so familiar poor little Rubens!) I thought I never seen Rector's garden richer beauty, heard chorus birds he loved protected. Indeed border plants luxuriant almost disorder. It struck Mr. Andrewes gardening time. Perhaps idea led notice ill he looked I went indoors. But dinner seemed revive him, warm summer sunset strolled outside again. The Rector leant heavily arm. He made joke height, I remember. (I proud grown tall, secretly thought well general appearance tail-coat "fifth form.") With one arm I supported Mr. Andrewes, hung side, hand Sweep ever anon thrust his nose caressingly. "How well garden looks!" I said. "And birds giving farewell concert." "Ah! You think too?" said Rector, quickly. I puzzled. "You going to-morrow, not?" I said. "Yes, course. I see," said Rector laughing. "I thinking longer journey. How superstitions cling north-countrymen! We have terrible lot Paganism us yet, Christians are!" "What superstition now?" said I. "Oh, part belief occult sympathy animal world humanity, which, indeed, I means prepared give up." "I think not!" said I. "Though doubtless idea feel presage impending death man must counted fable." "Awful rot!" comment. "I say, sir, I am sure you are well, get stuff head." "It is that," said Rector. "When I boy, I far strong, rather bookish, I constantly overworking head. What weird fancies fads I then, sure! I haunted lot nervous plagues it is best explain people never tormented them. One least annoying sensation took possession everything I saw, heard, did, 'for last time.' I have often run back lane get another glimpse home, done something I finished--to break charm! The old childish folly plaguing last days. It strong to-night." "Then we will talk something else," said I. Eventually conversation became religious one. It like old days I went school. We much religious talk late years. To say truth, since I became Eton man religious fervour childhood died out. A strong belief practical power prayer (especially "when everything else failed") almost remained resolution Polly alluded her letter. In discussions her, I took Leo's view subject. I warned her common-sense way "religious overmuch" (not I definite religious measure mind); I laughed Helen; I indulged little cheap wit, made Polly furious, smart sneers women parsons. I puzzled her scraps old philosophy, theological difficulties venerable standing, proud discomfit her faith soul stake matter. I fairly drove her tears origin evil. Sometimes I would "Sunday talks" her different spirit, even she said I "did her good," I would believe she could "have anything repent of." I fancy Mr. Andrewes asked come evening greatly purpose "Sunday talk." My father wished confirmed home rather school, Bishops hold confirmations short intervals now, opportunity occurred. Mr. Andrewes preparing me, great annoyance his ill-health obliged go away middle his instructions. I think he feverish night. Every he spoke rapidly I could hardly follow him. Then pauses he seemed lost, abrupt changes subject, he could hardly control order his thoughts. And evident strain anxiety say everything he wished say appeared morbid fancy "the last time." After talked time he said, "Life goes wonderfully fast, Regie, though may think now. I well remember child myself. I eight years old, I think, I prayed money enough buy _Fuchsia coccinea_ (they England ten twelve years then). My brother gave half-a-crown, I got one. It seems one yonder must it. I began model father's house card-board one winter, too. Then I got bronchitis, finish it. I intending finish ever since, lies uncompleted box upstairs. So purpose neglect, till death comes like nurse take us bed, finds tasks unfinished, takes away toys!" Presently he went on: "Our mechanical arbitrary division time indeed false one. See one day drags along, quickly another passes. The true measure time makes man's life day, his day. The real night man work. Indeed, nothing true natural Eastern expressions. I remember things happened childhood one remembers one morning. What lot things I meant to-day! And one runs garden instead setting work, noon one knows he is, people take one's time, afternoon slips away, man's day need fifty times length he means ought do, run distractions devil sends well. So comes old age, evening one tired, it is hard make fresh start; we are pretty near end, 'the last feather shuttle,' say Yorkshire. I often think pitiful shortness life, compared man's hopes plans, almost proof enough must another, better fitted his aims capacities. And then--measure folly securing _that_! And talking proofs, Regie, whilst I am taking privilege season confirmation proffer little advice, things make mind believe, grounds believe it. Ask yourself, boy, believe articles Apostles' Creed real positive truths. Do think evidence facts, matters history? Are ever likely time talent test yourself? And, not, consider authority done so, staked everything upon truth, sufficient? Will receive Creed Church? Make mind, boy, things make mind! Have _some_ convictions, real opinions, worthy hopes; loyal to, earnest about, whatever pin faith to, I assure vagueness faith affects people's every-day conduct think. The sort belief takes man church Sunday would ashamed look he really praying, confessing real sins he gets there, small help balances right wrong. It truly, matter mere common sense, poor bargain, wretched speculation, half religious; get checks scruples it, real strength peace; and, may be, lose man's soul, even gain world. For dare promise Christ Judge, spent self-denying human youth example, loved us die us, accept youth indifference, dissatisfied death-bed part? And true, gratitude common sense, self-preservation, example advice great men, demand shall serve GOD powers, do not think devil must, speak, laugh his sleeve see us really conceited large-minded attend closely, begin attend early, best interests?" "Ah!" he added while, "my dear boy--dearer tell--the truth is, I covet unutterable blessing youth given GOD. What is, know, many man converted late life imagined heart-wrung envy: Augustine, already numbered Saints, Prodigal robed decked pardon, haunted yet dark shadows past, husks swine. My boy, unstained youth yet mould will, get elder son's portion--'Thou art ever Me, I thine.' And GOD abide Him, even here, describe? It is worth trying for, lad; would worth trying for, chance GOD fulfilling His promises, His Word open question. How well worth effort, struggle, you will know stand I stand to-night." We reached front steps house he said this. The last sentences spoken jerks, he seemed alarmingly feeble. I shrank understanding he meant his last words, though I knew he refer actual spot stood. The garden black gloaming. The reflection yellow light left sunset west gave unearthly brightness his face, I fancied something common voice he quoted: "Jesu, spes poenitentibus, Quam pius es petentibus! Quam bonus te quaerentibus! _Sed quid invenientibus_!" But I fanciful Sunday, his nervous "fads" infectious ones; also superstition strong to-night "the last time." CHAPTER XXVI I HEAR FROM MR. JONATHAN ANDREWES--YORKSHIRE--ALATHEA _alias_ BETTY--WE BURY OUR DEAD OUT OF OUR SIGHT--VOICES OF THE NORTH I sat short time father return. When I went bed, amazement Sweep absent, I could find anywhere. I like return Rectory, fear disturbing Mr. Andrewes' rest, I went bed without dog. I early next morning, I resolved go station see Mr. Andrewes off, though his train early one, I might disabuse his superstition meeting more. It secret sense relief, part, I saw arranging his luggage. Sweep, by-the-by, turned breakfast, me. "I have come see off," I shouted, "and break charm _last times_, Sweep come too." "Strange say, Sweep came back last night, left," said Rector, laughing; "and he added omen superstition sitting window I turned out, howling like Banshee." Sweep looked rather foolish he wagged his tail answer Rector's greeting. He air saying, "We little excited last night. Let pass." For part I felt quite reassured. The Rector his sunniest mood, he watched us window last, his face bright smiles, he hardly looked ill. For days Sweep I absent, fishing. When I returned, I found mantelpiece black-edged letter unfamiliar hand. But black I fancied bill. The writing called "commercial." I opened read follows: "North Side Mills, Blackford, Yorks. 4/8, 18--. "SIR, "I announce lamented Decease Brother--Reverend Reginald Andrewes, M.A.--which took place 3rd inst. (3.35 A.M.), Oak Mount, Blackford; rough Hospitality much Service, purpose attend Funeral. Deceased expressed wish follow remains; respected Father think accompanying you, Compliment give much pleasure Survivors. "Funeral party leave Oak Mount 4 P.M. Thursday next (the 8th inst.), D.V. "A line say may expected enable meet you, oblige, "Yours respectfully, "JONATHAN ANDREWES. "Reginald Dacre, Esq., June" It useless dwell upon bitterness blow. My father felt much I did, neither he I ever found loss repaired. One loses friends lifetime whose places never filled. We went funeral. Had journey less sad, I certainly enjoyed much. The railway ran beautiful scenery, long coach journey end admiration Rector's native county. I never seen anything like noble hills, grand slopes moorland stretching away side us drove valley river running us gave name. Not quiet, sluggish river, keeping flat pastures green, reflecting straight lines pollard willows, constantly flowing past gay villas country cottages, pretty, brawling river stony bed, yellow iron, brown peat, long distances running solitary race hills, made useful ugly mills built upon banks. Sometimes hamlet well mill. Tracts neighbouring moorland enclosed cultivated, fields divided stone walls, looked rude strange enough us. The cottages also built stone; drove village I could see, several open doors, rooms clean comfortably furnished, though without carpets, floors, like everything else, stone. It dark reached Blackford. The latter part journey coal iron district, glare furnace fires among hills like nothing I ever seen. At coach office met Mr. Jonathan Andrewes. He tall, well-made man, badly-fitting clothes, rather tumbled linen, imperfectly brushed hair hat, want fresh cleanliness finish general appearance went idea gentleman's outside. I found warm-hearted, cold-mannered man, clear, strong head, shrewdness observation recalled Rector mind once. The tones his voice made start sometimes, like voice I could never hear life. He spoke always broad dialect Rector will not relapse moments excitement. A carriage, better appointed owner, man-servant rather less so, waiting, took us Oak Mount. In hall host apologized absence Mrs. Andrewes, sea-side, health. "But Betty  will her best make comfortable, sir," he said father, turning middle-aged woman hard-featured, sensible face, golden hair tightly braided her head, already busy luggage, he added, "You have got something us eat, Betty, I suppose?" "T' supper  will ready you are ready it," said Betty, she finished her orders man taking things upstairs. "But folks come journey, they will glad wash 'ands, I have took hot water rooms." The maid's familiarity startled me. Moreover, I fancied reason she angry, judging form manner her reply; I since learned ordinary answers Scotch Yorkshire folk apt sound like retorts replies. In end I became friendly good woman. Her real name, I discovered, Betty. "They call Alathea," she said, meaning her name, "but I have allus gone name Betty." From her I learnt particulars dear friend's last illness, I never got brother. "He talked deal you," she said. "But see, you are t' age his son would he would lived." "His son!" I cried: "was Mr. Andrewes married?" "Ay," said she, "Master Reginald married going i' two year. It his wife's death made queer he could not abide business, he would allus great scholard, he went parson." Every detail I could get Alathea interesting me. Apart sadly interesting subject, she admirable powers narration. Her language (when become local comprehension) forcible racy degree, she checked reserve clogged Mr. Jonathan's lips. The following morning she came door drawing-room (a large dreary room, which, like rest house, handsomely _upholstered_ rather furnished), beckoned mysteriously door. I went her. "You would like see body afore fastens up?" she said. I bent head followed her. "He makes beautiful corpse," she whispered, passed room. It incongruous remark, stirred hysterical feeling driving laugh I felt sad amid grotesquely dreary preparations "burying." But, like sayings offend ears polite, merit truth. It beauty Rector's face death, however, noble was, alone drew cry admiration I stooped his coffin. From feet breast, utterly hiding grave clothes, tastefully grouped his last pillow, beautiful exotic flowers I ever beheld. Flowers lately introduced I never seen, flowers I knew rare, almost priceless--flowers gorgeous colours delicate hothouse beauty, lay profusion. "Mr. Jonathan sent  them," Betty murmured ear. "There is pounds pounds' worth lies there. He give orders accordingly. There warn't flower 'at warn't worth weight gowd a'most. Mr. Reginald fond flowers." I made answer. Bitterly ached heart think dear noble face buried sight; familiar countenance light sight Sweep. "He looks happy," I muttered, almost jealously. Alathea laid her hand upon arm. "Them sleeps Jesus rests well, dear. And, I said Master Jonathan morning, are not fit overbegrudge 'ats gone Home." I think naming Name, alone vanquish bitter victories death, recalled verse floating head ever since evening Rectory: "Jesu, spes poenitentibus, Quam pius es petentibus! Quam bonus te quaerentibus! _Sed quid invenientibus_!" The loneliness childhood given habit talking myself. I know I quoted verse old hymn aloud, till I discovered fact hearing afterwards, small surprise, Betty reported I "made beautiful prayer corpse." * * * * * The grim hideous pomp funeral oppressive, though abundance plumes mutes Mr. Jonathan had, graceful tribute flowers, honoured his brother nobly his manner, commercial one. It expensive "burying." Alathea tell "the gin whiskey mourners alone come to," though I forgotten. But lost sight ignoble features occasion sublime office Burial Dead began. When ended I understood one Betty's brusque remarks, puzzled came breakfast-time. "You will 'ave take ye get dinners, gentlemen," she said; "for singers meet three, I cannot pretend I can." The women mourners funeral (there few) wore large black silk hoods, completely disguised them; end service one pushed back, I recognized golden hair Alathea, she joined group rather formally collected one side grave. She looked round see ready, soprano voice one seldom hears, she "started" funeral hymn. It Old Psalm-- "O GOD, help ages past, Our hope years come; Our shelter life's stormy blast, And eternal home." I heard little chorus-singing kind; I know best I heard--that St. George's choir Windsor--voices systematically imported particular district. My experience village singing confined thin nasal unison psalmody school children, occasional rustic stave farmer agricultural dinner. Great, then, astonishment little group broke four-part harmony fine chorale. One rarely hears voices. Betty grand soprano, edge group stood little lad singing like bird, alto sweet pathos would made famous cathedral choir. Mr. Jonathan's head drooped lower lower. Affecting hymn ears, him, doubt, associations I could share. My father moved near him, impulse respectful sympathy. To one rich voice harmony spoke voice old teacher; I longed cry return, "I made mind. It _is_ worth trying for! It 'worth effort, struggle.' Our eternal home!" CHAPTER XXVII THE NEW RECTOR--AUNT MARIA TRIES TO FIND HIM A WIFE--MY FATHER HAS A SIMILAR CARE FOR ME The stone marks burying-place Andrewes family taught secret special love Rector bore me. It recorded deaths his wife Margaret, his son Reginald. The child born year myself. Mr. Jonathan Andrewes came Dacrefield business connected his brother's affairs, he accepted father's hospitality Hall. We seldom met afterwards, never intimate; but, slight was, tie friendship rather acquaintance. The next presentation Rectory Dacrefield father's gift. He held alternately Bishop, he owed Mr. Andrewes. He gave old tutor. Mr. Clerke's appointment rare merit pleasing everybody. After he settled us weeks, father said, "Mr. Clerke good enough grateful presenting living, I know grateful enough accepting it. I really cannot think I endured see Andrewes' place filled new broom sweeping away every trace dear friend his ways. Clerke's good taste matter delicate, admirable, pleasant feelings." The truth truer mourner old Rector new one. "I little thought I never see again," he cried me. "I often felt I half avail privilege knowing man, I here. I notes score matters, I purposed ask his good counsel, meet again. And never be." "I feel unworthy fill his place," he would say. "My comfort trying carry his plans, and, far I can, tread his steps." In spirit new Rector followed old one, even becoming expert gardener. He bought old furniture Rectory. Altogether, spared rude evidences change least painful parts loss ours. With parishioners, I convinced, Mr. Clerke popular Mr. Andrewes been. They liked first his reverence memory pastor loved well. I think he persuaded them, too, never could another Rector equal Mr. Andrewes. But reality I believe he acceptable. He much less able, also less eccentric reserved. He nearer mental calibre his flock, entering parish gossip discreet fashion. He less zealous his predecessor. When Aunt Maria came visit us she gladly renewed acquaintance Mr. Clerke, great favourite hers. I think she imagined he presented Dacrefield strength her approval. She used say me, "You know Reginald, I always told father Mr. Clerke spiritual preacher." But seeing Rector Dacrefield, she added, "He is getting much 'high.' Quite like extraordinary creature before. But it is always way young men." Uncle Ascott publicly undertake Mr. Clerke's defence, he told me: "I do not pretend understand matters Maria does, I tell I never liked London parsons I like Clerke. There is something I respect beyond anything feeling he late Rector. And ourselves, dear boy, I rather like nicely-conducted service." So Uncle Ascott Mr. Clerke best friends, uncle would go Rectory quiet smoke, always hospitably received. (Neither aunt father liked smell tobacco.) Aunt Maria's favour little withdrawn. She tried delicate remonstrance, though he courteous, mistaken Rector Dacrefield meant go his way: "the way better man I shall ever be," he said. Failing change his principles, guide his practice, aunt next became anxious find wife. "Medical men country parsons ought married," said she, "and settle him." She selected young lady neighbourhood, daughter medical man. "Most suitable," said aunt (by she meant _quite_ standard she would exacted son her own), "and little money." She patronised young lady, even took her us one day lunch Rectory; she said something Mr. Clerke subject, she found utterly obdurate. "What he expect, I wonder?" cried aunt, rather unfairly, Rector given utterance matrimonial hopes. She always said, "She never could feel Mr. Clerke behaved well poor Letitia Ramsay," used make downright Polly indignant. "He did not behave badly her. It mamma always took her everywhere he was; she could stand it, I do not know! He never flirted her, Regie." The next years life seemed whirl by. They happy ones. My dear father lived, mutual affection grew stronger time went on. Then, I man, gradually dawned upon me, many hints, father anxiety Aunt Maria Rector. He wished marry. At one time another fancy taken pretty girls, unsuitable every respect prettiness, failed return admiration. My dear father would dreamed urging marriage inclinations, he would preferred lady fortune his daughter-in-law. "Our family old one, dear boy," he said, "but estate much smaller great-grandfather's time. Do not suppose I would marry money alone; lady well portioned, sir, much better--so much better." At last he seemed set his heart upon one Aunt Maria's daughters. People live years years country estates without going much home apt sometimes fancy nothing like family circle. My father great objection, too, he called "modern young ladies." I think he thought that, girl left world like poor mother, I safer happier one cousins. They unexceptionably brought up, would considerable fortunes. But though I fond cousins, I wish choose wife them. They like sisters cousins childhood. At one time, true, I rather sentimental Helen. She one sisters positively pretty, her resolute character unusual tastes roused romantic interest while. When she twelve years old, she found one day Aunt Maria bedroom servant fallen ill, she attending utmost dexterity. She genius duties sick room, developed she grew up. There lady-doctors then, Helen determined hospital nurse. Strongly Aunt Maria object, Helen never defied her wishes matter. But she Mrs. Ascott's determination, patience. She waited long, she followed her vocation last. None girls special tastes. The laborious expensive education childhood lead anything worth name pursuit, much less hobby, one them. Of happiness learning, exciting interest intellectual hobby, knew nothing. With much pains labour drilled arts sciences, languages "the usual branches English education." But, apart social duties amusements, chief occupation lives needlework. I known many people never received proper instruction music drawing, yet, picked either art industry intelligence, nearly doubled happiness daily lives. But vain "the first masters" made cousins glib chromatic passages, dexterous tricks effects colours crayons. They played duets dinner, Aunt Maria sometimes showed water-colour copies school-room days, which, indeed, recopied bazaars; pleasure never touched note pencil. Perhaps real enjoyment comes one has, great extent, taught oneself. Helen her mistress art nursing, all-absorbing interest her. They nice girls, I think entirely blame small use put "advantages." They tall lady-like, aquiline-nosed pleasant-looking, without actual beauty. It took wonderful quantity tarlatan get ready ball, large carriage hold them, small amount fun make talkative happy. Except Maria, inherited aunt's firmness decision character. Maria, oldest largest, yielding. She Uncle Ascott her. CHAPTER XXVIII I BELIEVE MYSELF TO BE BROKEN-HEARTED--MARIA IN LOVE--I MAKE AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE, WHICH IS NEITHER ACCEPTED NOR REFUSED A phase life, I propose enter, left firmly resolved (as I said confidence Clerke) "I shall marry please governor. One does not go broken heart, know, is not _care_ second time." It shortly Maria her mother came stay Hall. A rather mysterious letter aunt led invitation. It benefit Maria's health. My father also invited Polly; she favourite him. Leo friends expected shooting. Our neighbours' houses well filling visitors, though I fancied disappointed man, I found spirits rising daily. My aunt Maria arrived first: Polly visiting elsewhere, join day two. I glad ladies house again, dinner I strolled grounds Maria. She looking delicate, improved her appearance, she quite pleased interest she seemed take place. But I seen Maria visit I paid London two months usual, quite surprised find her well versed Dacrefield matters. "It is uncommonly pleasant here," said I, leaned low wall garden. "I wonder become perfect barbarians, cut ladies' society. I am sure I wish would settle instead London. You would civilise Rectory Hall." I really thinking uncle taking house neighbourhood. I know Maria thinking of; she looked suddenly face, strange expression, half inclined speak. She said nothing, however, blushed deeply, began walking towards house. I puzzled minutes pathetic look blush, I could make nothing it, passed mind till next evening dinner, when, little ceremonious preamble, father asked "anything between" eldest cousin. In explanation vague question, he told Maria failing health spirits months; aunt's watchful observation experience led her conclusion Maria consumption, love. As, however, she kept her counsel, Mrs. Ascott could guess matter. From her feverish interest Dacrefield, her ill-concealed excitement visit proposed, improvement her health since she came, multitude small facts aunt ferreted patched together ingenuity amazed me, Maria supposed care me. "We good deal together town, sir," said I, "and Maria jolly me. But I sure I gave her reason think I love her, I do not believe she cares me. It is one aunt's mare's nests, depend upon it. The poor girl got horrid cough, and, course, she pleased get London smoke." "If care her," said father; "and, all, led her think did, course obvious, I doubt she would make excellent wife. Polly favourite, Maria year two older you. But she nice, sensible, well-bred woman. She eldest daughter, have--" "My dear father," said I, "Maria I friendly cousins, she idea brotherly relation. At least I think not," I added, look blush puzzled came back mind. "I mention I wished warn trifling cousin's affections mean nothing," said father. "I sorry trifle lady's affections, sir," reply. We said more. I sighed, thinking I fully believed blighted existence. My father sighed, thinking, I know, his vain wish see happily married. At last I could bear longer, calling Sweep, I went garden. It moonlight, Maria languidly pacing terrace. I joined her, strolled away shrubbery. I cannot say father's warning led shun Maria's society. My father aunt naturally talked together, circumstances almost forced us two _t√™te-√†-t√™tes_. I could fail see Maria liked me, I found task taking care her soothing I believed blighted feelings. We rode together (she admirable figure rode well), exercise her health great good. We often met Mr. Clerke rides, he seemed enjoy canter us, though he rode little better I first knew him. We took long walks Sweep, oldest tenant latest puppy, everything Dacrefield seemed interest fair cousin. I came last believe Aunt Maria right. When I come believe (and I think contemptible conceit made hasty so), thoughts followed. I firmly convinced young man experiences I could never feel I felt person shall nameless. But first bitterness agony undoubtedly over, I felt I might find sober satisfaction making father's declining years happy giving daughter-in-law, I perhaps hardly justified allowing Maria fall consumption I could prevent it. "There people," thought I, "with one could spend life happily quiet fashion; people would offend one's taste, greatly provoke one's temper, one feels one could please like manner. _Suitable_ people, fact. And fellow his great heart-ache it is over, doubt suitableness thing make married life happy.... Maria suitable." I remember well day I came conclusion. Our visitors yet arrived, Polly expected next day, Leo others shortly. "I may well get house full," I thought. But, vexation, I discovered father asked Mr. Clerke come dinner. "It is his fault I do not get another chance speaking," thought I. But, I strolled sullenly terrace (without Maria) note arrived Rector say he called away see sick man. I dashed drawing-room, gave letter father, seeing Maria there, I went conservatory. There moments even plain people look handsome. Notably self-consciousness quite absent, absorbing thought gives sentiment face, grace power figure. It moment Maria, stood gazing her, light falling artistically her glossy hair tall, elegant figure. At sound footsteps she started, colour flooded her face I came her. She sank seat close by, much agitated stand. "I something I want say you," said I, stooping her, speaking gentlest voice. "May I say it?" She moved her lips trying speak, sound, she nodded her head, drooped I could hardly see her face. "We known since children," I began. "Yes, Regie dear," murmured Maria. "We always good friends, I think," continued I. "Oh, yes, Regie dear." "Childhood happy time," said I, sentimentally. "Oh, yes, Regie dear." "But cannot children ever," I continued. "Oh, no, Regie dear." "Please take I going say kindly, cousin, whatever may think it." "Oh, yes, Regie dear." "I hope I may truthfully say happiness is, ought be, chief aim matter." Maria's response inaudible. "It is good beating bush," said I, desperately clothing sentiments slang, manner age; "the fellow gets wife, Maria, must uncommonly fortunate, I hope good husband, made wishes his first consideration, would unhappy married life yourself." Lower lower went her head, still she silent. "You say nothing," I went on. "Probably I altogether wrong, kind-hearted tell I impertinent puppy. It Dacrefield--the place only--that honour regard. You affection for--" Maria let finish sentence. She put her hands stop me, seemed she wished speak; one pitiful glance she buried her face her hands wept bitterly. I sure I read somewhere woman weeps she won. So Maria mine. I grim feeling I cannot describe. "I hope governor satisfied now," thought. However, nothing I hate see woman cry. To means making her cry intolerable. "Please, please, do not! Oh, Maria, brute make feel. _Please_ do not," I cried, raising cousin her Niobe-like attitude, I comforted her well I could. She said, "Oh, Regie dear, kind are," laid her sleek head arm air rest trustfulness touched generosity quick. What right I, all, accept affection I could make similar return? "However," thought I, "it is done now; say it is always one side other; least I am gentleman. I care one else, she shall never know chiefly please governor. I suppose come right." Whilst I pondered, Maria dried her eyes, sat up, gazing her, almost her old attitude. "I wonder, Regie dear," she said, presently--"I wonder found I--that we--that I _cared_--" "Oh, I do not know," said I, inanely, I could say nothing could plainer. "I always used think live neighbourhood would paradise," murmured Maria, looking sentimentally vacantly box seedling balsams. "I am glad like it," said I. I could make pretty speeches. An unpleasant conviction stealing mind I fool, one blame. I began think Maria would died consumption even I proposed her, doubt I really heartbroken I fancied. (Indeed society cousin, lady, time gone far cure sentiment one not, sensible enough marry man her rank life, father's great relief, and, I thought, life-long disappointment.) The whole affair seemed mockery, I wished dream. It thus father plighted his troth fair mother. This sort affection made happy short lives Leo's parents. The lemon-scented verbena I pounding fingers bitterly recalled little sketch monument memory Leo shown his Bible, he also pressed sprig verbena. Beneath sketch he written, "They lovely pleasant lives, death divided." I remembered his telling young married. How his father never cared one else, he would like same, marry one lady his love. I began, too, think Clerke right he replied confidences, "I am afraid, Regie, do not know love is." It whilst thoughts crowding vividly mind Maria said, impressively, unmistakable clearness, "After _all_, know, Regie, he is _thorough_ gentleman, he _is_ poor. I must say _that_! And he _has_ profession instead landed proprietor, it is _highest_ _noblest_ profession is." It seemed take away breath. But I standing almost behind Maria; she preoccupied, I presence mind. I opportunity realize fact I object Maria's attachment, I supposed. I poor, I profession, common avocations not, I fear, deserve called high noble. The description way fitted me. Further still, evident cousin dreamed I making her offer. She believed I discovered her attachment man, grateful sympathy. I undeceive her. After rapid review position, I said, "But dear Maria, though I penetrated fact secret, though I want beyond anything help comfort you, I yet know happy man is, remember." "Do not you?" said Maria, looking hastily, colour rushed her face before. "Oh, I thought knew Mr. Clerke. You know, he _is_ good, I have known long." At moment Aunt Maria's voice called drawing-room end conservatory. "Will give us little music, Maria? Mr. Clerke come all, Bowles brought tea." CHAPTER XXIX THE FUTURE LADY DAMER--POLLY HAS A SECRET--UNDER THE MULBERRY-TREE Polly came house, she always did, like sunbeam. Mrs. Bundle, getting old, apt depressed spirits time time, always revived "Miss Mary" paid us visit. A general look welcome greeted her appearance church Sunday. My father made secret his pleasure her society. I think she secret her sister's engagement, Maria looked comforted her coming. Our meals quite merry. We plenty family gossip, news neighbourhood chat over. "So Lady Damer coming Towers," Maria announced breakfast, authority letter she reading. "Leo coming shoot, is not he, Regie?" "We expect every day," said I; "but I never knew he engaged. Who it?" "Well, it is announced engagement," said Maria, "but everybody says be. She heiress, her father old friend his guardian's. And, by-the-bye, Regie, her sister coming too, beautifully you. She co-heiress, know. They are really rich, one lovely." "I am sure I am much obliged you," said I, "and dine Towers next week, I shall see heiresses. But suppose I take fancy wrong one?" "You cannot her," said Maria, laughing. "I tell she Leo, she clever strong-minded, he wants--a wife take care him." "Oh, deliver strong-minded lady!" I cried. "Damer quite welcome her." "Your one is not bit strong-minded," said Maria. "She pretty, her all. She leans completely Frances; I do not know she will she marries, orphans since quite children, never lived apart week." At point Polly broke even warmth directness speech usual, "Frances Chislett superior girl I ever knew. Men always laugh strong-minded women; I am sure I do not know why. I cannot think human duties responsibilities either useful agreeable weak-minded." And Polly contributed nonsensical conversation heiresses. After she came I forsook society Maria. I knew she wanted talk Rector parish. Besides, though Maria strongly interested Dacrefield Clerke's sake, she knew much less Polly, I revisited numberless haunts childhood, barns stables, fernery, "Pulpit" "Pew." I tell her romance Maria. I proud it. But sat together old apple-room stables, I confided her "unfortunate attachment," I sufficiently recovered offended her opinion, best ended had. I remember exactly I came know Polly--even Polly--had her private heart-ache. I think I took unfair advantage her strict truthfulness, I suspected she secret, insisted upon her confiding I done her. Nurse Bundle gave first hint. Mrs. Bundle, however, believed "Miss Mary" waiting ask her mistress Dacrefield Hall. And though she "never seen young lady good enough her boy," she graciously allowed I might "do worse marry Miss Mary." "My time's pretty near come, dear," said Mrs. Bundle, "but many's time I pray Lord let live put pin, lady dresses her wedding." But I fooled second time affectionate belief friends attractions. "My dear old Nursey," said I, squatting Sweep her easy chair, "I know dear girl Polly is, she wanted Mrs. Dacre she soon be. But you are quite mistaken there; she dear sister, always so, never anything else." "Well, well," said Nurse Bundle, "young folks know affairs better old ones, Lord knows what is good us all, I am great age, Squire's young, taking liberty name us together, deary, reason would blessing see happy lady fit take dear mother's place Miss Mary is. For let alone everything else, dear, servants used be, I am dead you will cheated house home, without one knows goes keeping family, do not." "Well, Nursey," said I, "I will try find lady please governor. But will not Polly, I know, I wish may one good." I bullied poor Polly sadly secret, confiding me. She far expert dissembling, never told untruth, I soon drove her corner. "I am rather disappointed, I must confess, one way," said I, found her unable flatly deny she "care for" somebody. "I always hoped, somehow, Leo would make together." "You heard Maria said," said Polly, shortly. "Oh, I do not believe heiress," said I, "unless you have refused him. He would never take blue-stocking lady her money-bags his old love would him." "I wish would not call her names," said Polly, angrily. "I tell she is best girl I ever knew. I do not care much girls; silly. I suppose you will say that is envy, I cannot help it, it is true. But Frances Chislett never bores me. She makes ashamed myself, long like her. When she is I feel rough, ignorant, useless, and--" "What soothing companion!" I broke in. "Poor Damer! So want marry her, one takes nasty medicine--all his good." "Want marry her!" repeated Polly, expressively. "No. But I satisfied he marry _her_. So long he really happy, his wife worthy him--and _she_ worthy him--" A light dawned upon me, I interrupted her. "Why, Polly, _is_ Leo care for!" We sitting old mulberry-tree near gate, kitchen garden, I said Polly jumped tried run away. I caught her hand detain her, standing much attitude couple certain sentimental print entitled "The Last Appeal," gate close us opened, father put his head garden, shouting "James! James!" I dropped Polly's hand, struck idea, blushed ludicrously; girls knew well I plans made behalf respective parents. "The men dinner, sir," said I, going towards father. "Can I anything?" "Not all--not all; do not let disturb you," said old gentleman, unmistakably pleased expression countenance. And turning blushing Polly, he added his gracious tones, "You look charming, dear, standing old mulberry-tree, pretty dress. It planted grandfather, great-grandfather, love, Regie's also. I wish I could painted so. Quite picture--quite picture!" Saying which, waving attempts follow him, he bowed shut door behind him. When he gone, Polly I looked other, burst laughing. "The plot certainly thickens," said I, sitting again. "I beg listen gratified parent whistling he retires. What shall do, Polly, could blush so?" "How could I help I saw get red?" said Polly. "We certainly wonderful family point," said I; "the whole lot us mess love affairs, aunt governor completely wrong scents." "Oh, I think everybody's same," said Polly, picking half-ripe mulberries flinging hither thither; "but does not make one better pleased oneself fool." "You are fool," said I, pulling her seat again; "but I wish would not cross you are unhappy. Look me. Disappointment made sympathetic instead embittering me. But, seriously, Polly, I am sure Leo come right, general rejoicing mother must let Clerke poor Maria happy. Even I might found consolation beautiful heiress I left find her merits myself; one gets rather tired young ladies suggested one attentive friends. The fact is, matrimony line. I feel awfully old. The governor years younger I am. Whoever saw _me_ trouble _my_ long legs back perform bow he gave now? I wish he would leave peace Sweep. Since day I came age, every old farmer place wound his speech something future Mrs. Reginald Dacre, I have quiet life her. Clerke too! I really think Clerke confirmed old bachelor, ecclesiastical grounds. I wish I would gone fishing Norway. I wish bit house would fall down. If governor busy real brick mortar, he would not build many castles air, perhaps." As I growled, Sweep, beneath feet, growled also. I believe sympathy, lest approach Aunt Maria (whom Sweep detested), Polly I thought well withdraw garden another gate. We returned house, I took her den find book divert her thoughts. I surprised long search ended her choosing finely-bound copy Young's "Night Thoughts." "I often feel ashamed knowing little standard poets," she remarked parenthetically. "Quite so," said I; "but I feel right mention marks mine." CHAPTER XXX I MEET THE HEIRESS--I FIND MYSELF MISTAKEN ON MANY POINTS--A NEW KNOT IN THE FAMILY COMPLICATIONS Leo came Hall. "His" heiress came Towers, "mine." She follow shortly. I could make matters stood Leo Polly. When Damer came, Polly three times _brusque_ us; he seemed dreamy, usual. We went dine Towers. We rather late. Leo, right his rank, took dowager position dinner. Our host led across room, introduced "Miss Chislett." [Illustration: It quiet dinner party, Miss Chislett brought her needlework.] She sort person I expected. It flashed across I understood something Polly's remark Frances Chislett making her feel "rough." My cousins ladies every sense term, Miss Chislett certain perfection courteous grace dignified refinement, every word, gesture, attitude, utterly natural her vigorous tread barefooted peasant girl, one meet (but means invariably) among women highest class England. Her dignity fell short haughtiness (which high breeding, easy assumption); her grace courtesy simple results constant skilful consideration people, self-respect sufficient dispense self-consciousness. The advantage wealth evident exquisite taste general effect her costume. She beautiful, yet I felt disposed angry argument cousins subject her looks. Her head nobly shaped, her figure tall beautiful, her grey eyes haunted one. I never took lady dinner gave little trouble. When together two minutes, I felt I known her years. "Well, think her?" said Polly, met drawing-room. Polly taken Mr. Clerke, neither paid much attention saying. Maria said "yes" "no" alternately observations elderly Honourable Mr. Edward Glynn; he deaf mattered less. "Was I right?" said Polly. "No," said I; "she is bit strong-minded." Polly laughed. "I will say one thing her," said I; "I do not mind often I take her dinner. She does not expect make conversation." "Why, dear Regie," said Polly, "you have talking whole dinner-time!" Leo seated heiress. Poor Polly's eyes kept wandering towards them, (I suppose, I heard much her) mine. It quiet dinner-party, Miss Chislett brought her needlework, gossamer lace affair, Leo leant sofa she sat, playing contents her workbox. Polly's eyes mine ones turned towards them. Ours interest future Lady Damer. Aunt Maria carried Polly piano "give us little music," I sat stultified album table, Frances Chislett chatted Sir Lionel. They close me, every word said audible. It veriest chit-chat, Leo's remarks little bunch charms knicknacks he found workbox seemed trivial foolishness. "I would idea Damer empty-headed," I thought, I rather despised Miss Chislett smiling his feeble conversation. "I often wonder what is use farthings," I heard say he turned one bunch knicknacks. "They will not buy anything (unless it is box matches). They help tradesmen cheat they are 'selling off.'" "I beg pardon," said Miss Chislett, "I bought charming things farthing each." "So I," said I, turning round chair, joining conversation, seemed less purposeless I began take part it. Leo looked us puzzled air. "Frying-pans, instance," said Miss Chislett. "--and gridirons," said I. "Plates, knives, forks," said heiress. "--and flat irons," I concluded; playing involuntarily blob lead still hung watch-chain. Polly finished her performance, standing near us. She understood allusion, laughed. "Do _you_ know they are talking about?" asked Sir Lionel, going her. I sat heiress. "Were ever Oakford?" she asked, turning her grey eyes me. She spoke almost abruptly, touch imperiousness suddenly recalled I seen eyes before. "Certainly," said I, "and tinsmith's." "What there?" she asked, years mistaking accent gesture little lady grey beaver. Before she well begun her apology question, I answered it, "BUYING A FLAT IRON FOR A FARTHING." * * * * * "Well, you have gone hard to-night, old fellow," said Damer, drove away Towers. "You Miss Chislett county talk six months come." "Nonsense," said I, "we knew years ago, good deal talk about." But Polly, parted night corridor, I said, "My dear child, add family complications, I am head ears love future Lady Damer." CHAPTER XXXI MY LADY FRANCES--THE FUTURE LADY DAMER--WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER AT LAST It true. My theories disappointment went winds. We common acquaintances social interests talk about, yet time spent together never seemed long enough fluent conversation. We always thousand things say met, feeling together lives, I felt also utterly restless wretched I her. Of course, I learnt her history. She her sister little ladies I seen childhood. The St. John family cousins, boy, mention made, die Madeira, property eventually came Frances Chislett her sister. The estate sold, co-heiresses. Adeline, sister, soon came Towers. She like her old self Frances. The exquisitely, strangely fair hair, pale-blue eyes, gentle helpless look, same. She lovely, Frances like woman I ever seen before, ever met since. I resolved ask Lionel Damer matters really stood them, and, he engaged her, try luck. One day she us Hall I decided upon this. I told Lionel library, went seek him. As I opened door I saw standing front Polly, standing also. He speaking energy rare him, tone voice quite strange me. "It is like say what is true," he saying. "You _not_ well, _not_ happy. You may deceive every one else, Polly, never deceive me. All years, ever since I first knew you--" I stole out, shut door, went seek Frances. I found her Rubens' grave, plighted troth. * * * * * It evening day Polly I met hall, way attempt difficult task dressing dinner five minutes. The grey-eyed lady love left purpose, I singing, I do not know what, top voice pure blitheness heart. Polly I fairly rushed other's arms. "My dear child!" said I, swinging her madly round, "I delirious delight, Sweep, she kissed his nose." Poor Polly buried her head shoulder, saying, "And, oh, Regie! I _am_ happy!" It thus father Aunt Maria found us. Fate, spiteful happiness, sent father, stiff irreproachable neckcloth, Aunt Maria, rustling amber silk black laces, towards drawing-room, five minutes early dinner, time catch us sentimental attitudes, hear dear, candid, simple-hearted Polly's outspoken confession--"I _am_ happy!" "And long going keep happiness yourselves, young people?" said father, whose face beamed satisfaction sedately reflected Aunt Maria's countenance. "Do grudge old folks share? Eh, sir? eh?" And old gentleman pinched shoulder, clapped back. He positively playful. "Stop, dear father," said I, "you are mistaken." "Eh, what?" said father, Aunt Maria drew her laces round her prepared war. "Polly I engaged, sir, that is think," said I, desperately. My father Aunt Maria opened mouths once. "Dinner's table, sir," butler announced. My father lacked subject his vexation, turned upon old Bowles: "Take dinner ----" "--the kitchen," said I, "and keep warm ten minutes; ready. Now, dear father, come room, I something tell you." There need Polly ask Aunt Maria go her. That lady drove her daughter her her bedroom, severity aspect puzzled alarmed poor Leo, passed corridor. A blind man could told rustle her dress Mrs. Ascott would full explanation she broke bread table. I fancy she severe upon future Lady Damer, Polly's tale told. As father, he certainly vexed put first. But day day lady-love his heart. One evening, week later, he disappeared mysteriously dinner, returned dining-room, carrying old morocco cases. "My dear boy," he said, almost faltering voice, "I never dared hope dear wife's diamonds would worthily worn yours. Your choice made old man happy, sir. For thoroughly high-bred tone, intelligence, indeed, I may say, brilliancy mind, every womanly grace virtue, I seen one approach her since mother's death. I loved little Polly much, choice higher one--more refined--more refined. For, strictly ourselves, dear boy, dear little Polly has, then, thought much Aunt Maria her." The Rector Maria made happy. My father "carried through," desire. Uncle Ascott delighted, became benefactor parish; took Aunt Maria years forget patronised curate scorned wife she provided him, marry her daughter. When I bade farewell Adeline wedding day, she gave her cheek kiss pretty grace, saying, "You see, Regie, I _am_ sister all!" CHAPTER XXXII WE COME HOME--MRS. BUNDLE QUITS SERVICE The day wife I returned wedding trip Dacrefield happy one. We triumphal welcome tenants, dear father beaming, Rector less so, good old Nurse Bundle showered blessings head bride. Frances great favourite her. She devoted old woman, her delicate tact made her adapt herself Mrs. Bundle's peculiarities. She sat her nursery night till nearly dinner-time. "I must take her away, Nursey," said I, coming in; "she will late dinner." "Go husband, dear," said Nurse Bundle, "and Lord bless both." "I will come back, Nursey," said Frances; "you will soon see again." "Turn face, dear," said Nurse Bundle. "Hold candle, Master Reginald. Ay, ay, that will do, deary. I will see again." We still dessert father, Bowles came hastily room pale face, went wife. "Did send Mrs. Bundle, madam, since came dinner?" he asked. "Oh, dear no," said wife. "Cook going upstairs, met Missis Bundle little way her room," Bowles explained; "and Missis Bundle she says, 'Do not stop me,' says she, 'Mrs. Dacre wants me,' she says, she goes; cook waits waits her room her, last she comes me, she says--" "But _is_ Mrs. Bundle?" cried father. "That is circumstantially nobody knows, sir," said Bowles distracted air. We three rushed upstairs. Mrs. Bundle found. My father frantic; wife tears lamented chance word might led half-childish old lady fancy she wanted her. But sudden conviction seized upon me. "You need trouble yourself, darling," said I; "you Mrs. Dacre Nurse Bundle went seek." I ran father's dressing-room. It I thought. Below mother's portrait, spot years she held her arms tears, I, weeping also, held her mine--quite dead. THE END
