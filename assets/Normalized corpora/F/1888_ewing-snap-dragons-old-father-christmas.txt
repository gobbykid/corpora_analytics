 SNAP-DRAGONS OLD FATHER CHRISTMAS CHAPTER ONE. MR AND MRS SKRATDJ. Once upon time lived certain family name Skratdj. (It Russian Polish look, yet certainly lived England.) They remarkable following peculiarity. They seldom seriously quarrelled, never agreed anything. It hard say whether painful friends hear constantly contradicting other, gratifying discover "meant nothing," "only way." It began father mother. They worthy couple, really attached other. But habit contradicting other's statements, opposing other's opinions, which, though mutually understood allowed private, trying by-standers public. If one related anecdote, would break half-a-dozen corrections trivial details interest importance anyone, speakers included. For instance: Suppose two dining strange house, Mrs Skratdj seated host, contributing small-talk dinner-table. Thus:-- "Oh yes. Very changeable weather indeed. It looked quite promising yesterday morning town, began rain noon." "A quarter past eleven, dear," Mr Skratdj's voice would heard say several chairs down, corrective tones husband father; "and really, dear, far promising morning, I must say looked threatening well could. Your memory always accurate small matters, love." But Mrs Skratdj wife mother fifteen years, snuffed one snap marital snuffers. As Mr Skratdj leaned forward his chair, she leaned forward hers, defended herself across intervening couples. "Why, dear Mr Skratdj, said weather promising week." "What I said, dear, pardon me, barometer higher week. But, might observed details line, love, not, rise extraordinarily rapid, surer sign unsettled weather.--But Mrs Skratdj apt forget unimportant trifles," he added, comprehensive smile round dinner-table; "her thoughts properly absorbed important domestic questions nursery." "Now I think that is rather unfair Mr Skratdj's part," Mrs Skratdj would chirp, smile quite affable general her husband's. "I am sure he is _quite_ forgetful inaccurate _I_ am. And I do not think _my_ memory _all_ bad one." "You forgot dinner hour going dine last week, nevertheless," said Mr Skratdj. "And could not help I asked you," sprightly retort. "And I am sure it is like forget anything _dinner_, dear." "The letter addressed you," said Mr Skratdj. "I sent Jemima," said Mrs Skratdj. "I did not read it," said Mr Skratdj. "Well, burnt it," said Mrs Skratdj; "and, I always say, there is nothing foolish burning letter invitation day, one certain forget." "I have doubt always say it," Mr Skratdj remarked, smile, "but I certainly never remember heard observation lips, love." "Whose memory's fault there?" asked Mrs Skratdj triumphantly; point ladies rose, Mrs Skratdj last word. Indeed, may gathered conversation, Mrs Skratdj quite able defend herself. When she yet bride, young timid, she used collapse Mr Skratdj contradicted her statements, set her stories straight public. Then she hardly ever opened her lips without disappearing domestic extinguisher. But course fifteen years she learned Mr Skratdj's bark great deal worse his bite. (If, indeed, he bite all.) Thus snubs made people's ears tingle, effect whatever lady addressed, she knew exactly worth, time become fairly adept snapping return. In days she succumbed she occasionally unhappy, she her husband understood other, agreed differ, unfortunately agreed also differ public. Indeed, by-standers worst occasions. To worthy couple habit become second nature, way affected friendly tenour domestic relations. They would interfere other's conversation, contradicting assertions, disputing conclusions whole evening; then, world his wife thought ceaseless sparks bickering must blaze flaming quarrel soon alone, would bowl amicably home cab, criticising friends commenting upon them, little agreed events evening details events whatever. Yes. The by-standers certainly worst it. Those near wished anywhere else, especially appealed to. Those distance mind much. A domestic squabble certain distance interesting, like engagement viewed point beyond range guns. In position one may day placed oneself! Moreover, gives touch excitement dull evening able say _sotto voce_ one's neighbour, "Do listen! The Skratdjs again!" Their unmarried friends thought terrible abyss tyranny aggravation must lie beneath all, blessed stars still single, able tell tale way. The married ones idea really was, wished name common sense good taste Skratdj his wife would make fools themselves. So went on, however; so, I suppose, goes still, many bad habits cured middle age. On certain questions comparative speaking views never identical. Such temperature hot cold, things light dark, apple-tarts sweet sour. So one day Mr Skratdj came room, rubbing his hands, planting fire "Bitterly cold to-day, sure." "Why, dear William," said Mrs Skratdj, "I am sure must got cold; I feel fire quite oppressive myself." "You wishing you would seal-skin jacket yesterday, was not half cold to-day," said Mr Skratdj. "My dear William! Why, children shivering whole day, wind north." "Due east, Mrs Skratdj." "I know smoke," said Mrs Skratdj, softly decidedly. "I fancy I tell east wind I feel it," said Mr Skratdj, jocosely, company. "I told Jemima look weathercock," murmured Mrs Skratdj. "I do not care fig Jemima," said her husband. On another occasion Mrs Skratdj lady friend conversing. ... "We met Smiths'--a gentlemanlike agreeable man, forty," said Mrs Skratdj, reference matter interesting ladies. "Not day thirty-five," said Mr Skratdj, behind his newspaper. "Why, dear William, his hair's grey," said Mrs Skratdj. "Plenty men grey thirty," said Mr Skratdj. "I knew man grey twenty-five." "Well, forty thirty-five, does not much matter," said Mrs Skratdj, resume her narration. "Five years matter good deal people thirty-five," said Mr Skratdj, he walked towards door. "They would make remarkable difference me, I know;" jocular air Mr Skratdj departed, Mrs Skratdj rest anecdote her way. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE LITTLE SKRATDJS. The Spirit Contradiction finds place nurseries, though varying degree different ones. Children snap snarl nature, like young puppies; us remember taking part spirited dialogues following:-- "I will." "You dare not." "You cannot." "I dare." "You shall." "I will tell Mamma." "I will not." "I do not care do." It part wise parents repress squibs crackers juvenile contention, enforce slowly-learned lesson, world one must often "pass over" "put with" things people, oneself means perfect. Also kindness, almost duty, let people think say things way occasionally. But even Mr Mrs Skratdj ever thought teaching children, must confessed lesson would come good grace either them, since snapped snarled much children nursery. The two eldest leaders nursery squabbles. Between these, boy girl, ceaseless war words waged morning night. And neither lacked ready wit, constant practice, art snapping cultivated highest pitch. It began breakfast, sooner. "You have taken chair." "It is chair." "You know it is one I like, place." "How know place?" "Never mind. I know." "No, do not." "Yes, I do." "Suppose I say place." "You cannot, was not." "I can, I like." "Well, it?" "I shall not tell you." "Ah! shews was not." "No, does not." "Yes, does." Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. The direction daily walks fruitful subject difference opinion. "Let us go Common to-day, Nurse." "Oh, do not let us go there; we are always going Common." "I am sure we are not. We have ever long." "Oh, story! We Wednesday. Let us go Gipsey Lane. We never go Gipsey Lane." "Why, we are always going Gipsey Lane. And there is nothing see there." "I do not care. I will not go Common, I shall go get Papa say we are go Gipsey Lane. I run faster you." "That is sneaking; I do not care." "Papa! Papa! Polly's called sneak." "No, I did not, Papa." "You did." "No, I did not. I said sneaking say you would run faster me, get Papa say go Gipsey Lane." "Then call sneaking," said Mr Skratdj. "And you are naughty ill-mannered little girl. You are getting troublesome, Polly, I shall send school, you will kept order. Go brother wishes once." For Polly her brother reached age convenient, possible, throw blame nursery differences Polly. In families domestic discipline rather fractious firm, comes stage girls almost invariably go wall, stand snubbing, boys not. Domestic authority, like powers, apt magnified weaker class. But Mr Skratdj would always listen even Harry. "If do not give back directly, I will tell eating two magnum-bonums kitchen garden Sunday," said Master Harry one occasion. "Tell-tale tit! Your tongue shall slit, And every dog town shall little bit," quoted his sister. "Ah! You have called tell-tale. Now I will go tell Papa. You got fine scrape calling names day." "Go, then! I do not care." "You would not like go, I know." "You dare not. That is is." "I dare." "Then do not you?" "Oh, I going; you will see end it." Polly, however, her reasons remaining stolid, Harry started. But he reached landing he paused. Mr Skratdj especially announced morning he wish disturbed, though he favourite, Harry desire invade dining-room crisis. So he returned nursery, said magnanimous air, "I do not want get scrape, Polly. If you will beg pardon I will not go." "I am sure I shall not," said Polly, equally well informed position affairs head-quarters. "Go, dare." "I will not want not," said Harry, discreetly waiving question apologies. "But I would rather went," said obdurate Polly. "You are always telling tales. Go tell now, you are afraid." So Harry went. But bottom stairs he lingered again, meditating return credit his dignity, Polly's face appeared banisters, Polly's sharp tongue goaded on. "Ah! I see you. You are stopping. You dare not go." "I dare," said Harry; last he went. As he turned handle door, Mr Skratdj turned round. "Please, Papa--" Harry began. "Get away you!" cried Mr Skratdj. "Did not I tell I disturbed morning? What extraor--" But Harry shut door, withdrawn precipitately. Once outside, he returned nursery dignified steps, air apparent satisfaction, saying,-- "You are give bricks, please." "Who says so?" "Why, say so? Where I been, pray?" "I do not know, I do not care." "I have Papa. There!" "Did he say I give bricks?" "I have told you." "No, you have not." "I shall not tell more." "Then I will go Papa ask." "Go means." "I will not you will tell truly." "I shall not tell anything. Go ask, dare," said Harry, glad tables turned. Polly's expedition met fate, she attempted cover her retreat similar manner. "Ah! did not tell." "I do not believe asked Papa." "Do not you? Very well!" "Well, you?" "Never mind." Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Meanwhile Mr Skratdj scolded Mrs Skratdj keeping children better order. And Mrs Skratdj said quite impossible so, Mr Skratdj spoilt Harry he did, weakened her (Mrs Skratdj's) authority constant interference. Difference sex gave point many nursery squabbles, often domestic broils. "Boys never they are asked," Polly would complain. "Girls ask unreasonable things," Harry's retort. "Not half unreasonable things ask." "Ah! that is different thing! Women got men tell them, whether it is reasonable not." "No, they have not!" said Polly. "At least, that is husbands wives." "All women inferior animals," said Harry. "Try ordering Mamma want, see!" said Polly. "Men got give orders, women obey," said Harry, falling back general principle, "And I get wife, I will take care I make her I tell her. But you will obey husband get one." "I will not husband, I I like." "Oh, will not you? You will try get one, I know. Girls always want married." "I am sure I do not know why," said Polly; "they must enough men brothers." And went on, _ad infinitum_, ceaseless arguments proved nothing convinced nobody, continual stream contradiction fell short downright quarrelling. Indeed, kind snapping even less near dispute cases mentioned. The little Skratdjs, like children, unfortunate delusion sounds clever hear little boys girls snap smart sayings, old rather vulgar play upon words, as: "I will give Christmas box. Which ear on?" "I will not stand it." "Pray take chair." "You shall to-morrow." "To-morrow never comes." And visitor kindly began talk one children, another sure draw near "take up" first child's answers, smart comments, catches sounded silly tiresome impertinent. And ill-mannered was, Mr Mrs Skratdj never put stop it. Indeed, caricature themselves. But often said, "We cannot think children always squabbling!" ------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE SKRATDJ'S DOG AND THE HOT-TEMPERED GENTLEMAN. It wonderful state mind whole household influenced heads it. Mr Skratdj kind master, Mrs Skratdj kind mistress, yet servants lived perpetual fever irritability fell short discontent. They jostled back stairs, said sharp things pantry, kept perennial warfare subject duty sexes general man-servant. They gave warning slightest provocation. The dog infected snapping mania. He brave dog, he vicious dog, high-breeding sanctioned his pretensions arrogance. But like his owners, he contracted bad habit, trick, made pest timid visitors, indeed visitors whatsoever. The moment anyone approached house, certain occasions he spoken to, often traceable connection all, Snap mongrel would rush out, bark his little sharp voice--"Yap! yap! yap!" If visitor made stand, he would bound away sideways his four little legs; moment visitor went his way again, Snap his heels--"Yap! yap! yap!" He barked milkman, butcher's boy, baker, though he saw every day. He never got used washerwoman, she never got used him. She said he "put her mind black dog Pilgrim's Progress." He sat gate summer, yapped every vehicle every pedestrian ventured pass high road. He never chance barking burglars; then, though he barked long loud, nobody got up, said, "It is Snap's way." The Skratdjs lost silver teapot, Stilton cheese, two electro christening mugs, occasion; Mr Mrs Skratdj dispute discouraged reliance Snap's warning present day. One Christmas-time, certain hot-tempered gentleman came visit Skratdjs. A tall, sandy, energetic young man, carried his bag railway. The bag crammed rather packed, will not bachelors; could see heel boot distended leather, bottle shaving-cream lay. As he came house, came Snap usual--"Yap! yap! yap!" Now gentleman fond dogs, borne greeting dozen times Snap, his part knew visitor quite well washerwoman, rather better butcher's boy. The gentleman good, sensible, well-behaved dogs his own, greatly disgusted Snap's conduct. Nevertheless he spoke friendly him; Snap, many bit his plate, could help stopping minute lick his hand. But sooner gentleman proceed his way, Snap flew his heels usual fashion-- "Yap! Yap! Yap!" On gentleman--being hot-tempered, one people (as say) word blow, blow first--made dash Snap, Snap taking his heels, gentleman flung his carpet-bag him. The bottle shaving-cream hit upon stone smashed. The heel boot caught Snap back, sent squealing kitchen. And he never barked gentleman again. If gentleman disapproved Snap's conduct, he still less liked continual snapping Skratdj family themselves. He old friend Mr Mrs Skratdj, however, knew really happy together, bad habit made constantly contradict other. It allusion real affection other, perpetual disputing, he called "Snapping Turtles." When war words waxed hottest dinner-table his host hostess, he would drive his hands his shock sandy hair, say, comical glance his umber eyes, "Do not flirt, friends. It makes bachelor feel awkward." And neither Mr Mrs Skratdj could help laughing. With little Skratdjs his measures vigorous. He fond children, good friend them. He grudged time trouble help games projects, he would tolerate snapping other's words his presence. He much truly kind many visitors, think polite smile sauciness forwardness ignorant vanity leads children often "shew off" strangers. These civil acquaintances abuse children parents behind backs, bad habits help encourage. The hot-tempered gentleman's treatment his young friends different. One day he talking Polly, making kind inquiries her lessons, she replying quiet sensible fashion, came Master Harry, began display his wit comments conversation, snapping contradicting his sister's remarks, she retorted; usual snap-dialogue went usual. "Then like music," said hot-tempered gentleman. "Yes, I like much," said Polly. "Oh, you?" Harry broke in. "Then always crying for?" "I am always crying it." "Yes, are." "No, I am not. I cry sometimes, I stick fast." "Your music must sticky, you are always stuck fast." "Hold tongue!" said hot-tempered gentleman. With he imagined waggish air, Harry put his tongue, held his finger thumb. It unfortunate he time draw hot-tempered gentleman gave stinging box ear, brought his teeth rather sharply together tip his tongue, bitten consequence. "It is use _speaking_," said hot-tempered gentleman, driving his hands his hair. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Children like dogs, good judges real friends. Harry like hot-tempered gentleman bit less he obliged respect obey him; children welcomed boisterously he arrived Christmas spoken connection his attack Snap. It morning Christmas Eve china punch bowl broken. Mr Skratdj warm dispute Mrs Skratdj whether kept safe place; brisk encounter housemaid, know happened; she, flouncing back passage, kicked Snap; forthwith flew gardener he bringing horse-radish beef; stepping backwards trode upon cat; spat swore, went pump her tail big fox's brush. To avoid domestic scene, hot-tempered gentleman withdrew breakfast-room took newspaper. By-and-by, Harry Polly came in, soon snapping comfortably affairs corner. The hot-tempered gentleman's umber eyes looking top his newspaper time, he called, "Harry, boy!" And Harry came him. "Shew tongue, Harry," said he. "What for?" said Harry; "you are doctor." "Do I tell you," said hot-tempered gentleman; Harry saw his hand moving, he put his tongue possible haste. The hot-tempered gentleman sighed. "Ah!" he said depressed tones; "I thought so!--Polly, come let look yours." Polly, crept process, put hers. But hot-tempered gentleman looked gloomier still, shook his head. "What it?" cried children. "What mean?" And seized tips tongues fingers, feel themselves. But hot-tempered gentleman went slowly room without answering; passing his hands his hair, saying, "Ah! Hum!" nodding air grave foreboding. Just he crossed threshold, he turned back, put his head room. "Have ever noticed tongues growing pointed?" he asked. "No!" cried children alarm. "Are they?" "If ever find becoming forked," said gentleman solemn tones, "let know." With he departed, gravely shaking his head. In afternoon children attacked again. "_Do_ tell us what is matter tongues." "You snapping squabbling usual morning," said hot-tempered gentleman. "Well, forgot," said Polly. "We do not mean anything, know. But never mind now, please. Tell us tongues. What going happen them?" "I am much afraid," said hot-tempered gentleman, solemn measured tones, "that you--fast--going--to--the--" "Dogs?" suggested Harry, learned cannot expressions. "Dogs!" said hot-tempered gentleman, driving his hands his hair. "Bless life, no! Nothing half pleasant! (That is, unless dogs like Snap, mercifully not.) No, sad fear is, you--rapidly--going--_to Snap-Dragons_!" And another word would hot-tempered gentleman say subject. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ CHRISTMAS EVE. In course hours Mr Mrs Skratdj recovered equanimity. The punch brewed jug, tasted quite good usual. The evening lively. There Christmas-tree, Yule cakes, log, candles, furmety, snap-dragon supper. When company tired tree, gained appetite hard exercise stretching high branches, blowing "dangerous" tapers, cutting ribbon pack-thread directions, supper came, welcome cakes furmety punch. And furmety somewhat palled upon taste (and must admitted boast sentiment flavour Christmas dish), Yule candles blown spirits palates party stimulated mysterious pungent pleasures snap-dragon. Then, hot-tempered gentleman warmed his coat-tails Yule-log, grim smile stole his features he listened sounds room. In darkness blue flames leaped danced, raisins snapped snatched hand hand, scattering fragments flame hither thither. The children shouted fiery sweetmeats burnt away mawkish taste furmety. Mr Skratdj cried spoiling carpet; Mrs Skratdj complained he spilled brandy her dress. Mr Skratdj retorted she wear dresses susceptible damage family circle. Mrs Skratdj recalled old speech Mr Skratdj subject wearing one's nice things benefit one's family, reserving visitors. Mr Skratdj remembered Mrs Skratdj's excuse buying particular dress she need it, her intention keeping next year. The children disputed credit courage amount raisins due each. Snap barked furiously flames; maids hustled good places doorway, would allowed man-servant see all, he looked heads. "St! St! At it! At it!" chuckled hot-tempered gentleman undertones. And he said this, seemed voices Mr Mrs Skratdj rose higher matrimonial repartee, children's squabbles became louder, dog yelped he mad, maids' contest sharper; whilst snap-dragon flames leaped up, blue fire flew room like foam. At last raisins finished, flames out, company withdrew drawing-room. Only Harry lingered. "Come along, Harry," said hot-tempered gentleman. "Wait minute," said Harry. "You better come," said gentleman. "Why?" said Harry. "There is nothing stop for. The raisins eaten, brandy burnt out--" "No, it is not," said Harry. "Well, almost. It would better quite out. Now come. It is dangerous boy like alone Snap-Dragons to-night." "Fiddle-sticks!" said Harry. "Go way, then!" said hot-tempered gentleman; he bounced room, Harry left alone. He crept table, one little pale blue flame flickered snap-dragon dish. "What pity go out!" said Harry. At moment brandy bottle side-board caught his eye. "Just little more," murmured Harry himself; he uncorked bottle, poured little brandy flame. Now course, soon brandy touched fire, brandy bottle blazed once, bottle split pieces; fortunate Harry he get seriously hurt. A little hot brandy get his eyes, made smart, he shut seconds. But he opened again, sight he saw! All room blue flames leaped danced leaped danced soup-plate raisins. And Harry saw successive flame fold long body bright blue Dragon, moved like body snake. And room full Dragons. In face like dragons one sees made old blue white china; forked tongues, like tongues serpents. They beautiful colour, sky-blue. Lobsters changed coats handsome, violet indigo lobster's coat nothing brilliant sky-blue Snap-Dragon. How leaped about! They ever leaping other, like seals play. But "play" them, rough kind; jumped, snapped barked other, barking like barking Gnu Zoological Gardens; time time tore hair other's heads claws, scattered floor. And dropped like flecks flame people shake fingers eating snap-dragon raisins. Harry stood aghast. "What fun!" said voice close him; he saw one Dragons lying near, joining game. He lost one forks his tongue accident, could bark awhile. "I am glad think funny," said Harry, "I do not." "That is right. Snap away!" sneered Dragon. "You are perfect treasure. They will take third round." "Not creatures?" cried Harry. "Yes, creatures. And I had not lost bark, I would first lead off," said Dragon. "Oh, game exactly suit you." "What it, please?" Harry asked. "You would better say `please' others," said Dragon, "if do not want hair pulled out. The game this. You always jumping somebody else, must either talk bark. If anybody speaks you, must snap return. I need explain _snapping_ is. _You know_. If anyone accident gives civil answer, claw-full hair torn his head stimulate his brain. Nothing funnier." "I dare say suits capitally," said Harry; "but I am sure should not like it. I mean men women children. It would not us all." "Would not it?" said Dragon. "You do not know many human beings dance dragons Christmas Eve. If kept going house till midnight, pull people beds, take dance Vesuvius." "Vesuvius!" cried Harry. "Yes, Vesuvius. We come Italy originally, know. Our skins colour Bay Naples. We live dried grapes ardent spirits. We glorious fun mountain sometimes. Oh! snapping, scratching, tearing! Delicious! There times squabbling becomes great, Mother Mountain will not stand it, spits us out, throws cinders us. But times. We charming meeting last year. So many human beings, _can_ snap! It choice party. So select. We always plenty saucy children, servants. Husbands wives too, quite many former latter, more. But besides these, two vestry-men, country postmaster, devoted his talents insulting public instead learning postal regulations, three cabmen two `fares,' two young shop-girls Berlin wool shop town competition, four commercial travellers, six landladies, six Old Bailey lawyers, several widows almshouses, seven single gentlemen nine cats, swore everything; dozen sulphur-coloured screaming cockatoos; lot street children town; pack mongrel curs colonies, snapped human beings' heels, five elderly ladies Sunday bonnets Prayer-books, fighting good seats church." "Dear me!" said Harry. "If find nothing sharper say `Dear me,'" said Dragon, "you fare badly, I tell you. Why, I thought you would sharp tongue, it is forked yet, I see. Here are, however. Off you! And value curls--Snap!" And Harry could reply, Snap-Dragons came third round, passed swept Harry them. He shuddered he looked his companions. They transparent shrimps, lovely cerulaean blue. And leaped barked--"Howf! Howf?"--like barking Gnus; leaped Harry leap them. Besides barking, snapped wrangled other; Harry must join also. "Pleasant, is not it?" said one blue Dragons. "Not all," snapped Harry. "That is bad taste," snapped blue Dragon. "No, it is not!" snapped Harry. "Then it is pride perverseness. You want hair combing." "Oh, please do not!" shrieked Harry, forgetting himself. On Dragon clawed handful hair his head, Harry screamed, blue Dragons barked danced. "That made hair curl, did not it?" asked another Dragon, leaping Harry. "That is business yours," Harry snapped, well he could crying. "It is pleasure business," retorted Dragon. "Keep yourself, then," snapped Harry. "I mean share you, I get hold hair," snapped Dragon. "Wait till get chance," Harry snapped, desperate presence mind. "Do know you are talking to?" roared Dragon; he opened his mouth ear ear, shot his forked tongue Harry's face; boy frightened he forgot snap, cried piteously,-- "Oh, I beg pardon, please do not!" On blue Dragon clawed another handful hair his head, Dragons barked before. How long dreadful game went Harry never exactly knew. Well practised he snapping nursery, he often failed think retort, paid his unreadiness loss his hair. Oh, foolish wearisome rudeness snapping seemed him! But he go, wondering time near twelve of the clock, whether Snap-Dragons would stay till midnight take Vesuvius. At last, his joy, became evident brandy coming end. The Dragons moved slower, could leap high, last one another began go out. "Oh, get away twelve!" thought poor Harry. At last one. He Harry jumped snapped barked, Harry thinking joy he last, clock hall gave whirring sound clocks strike, clearing throat. "Oh, _please_ go!" screamed Harry despair. The blue Dragon leaped up, took claw-full hair boy's head, seemed part skin went too. But leap his last. He went once, vanishing first stroke twelve. And Harry left his face floor darkness. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ CONCLUSION. When his friends found blood his forehead. Harry thought Dragon clawed him, said cut fragment broken brandy bottle. The Dragons disappeared completely brandy. Harry cured snapping. He quite enough lifetime, catch-contradictions household made shudder. Polly benefit his experiences, yet she improved also. In first place, snapping, like kinds quarrelling, requires two parties it, Harry would never party snapping more. And he gave civil kind answers Polly's smart speeches, she felt ashamed herself, repeat them. In second place, she heard Snap-Dragons. Harry told her hot-tempered gentleman. "Now think it is true?" Polly asked hot-tempered gentleman. "Hum! Ha!" said he, driving his hands his hair. "You know I warned you, going Snap-Dragons." ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Harry Polly snubbed "the little ones" snapped, utterly discountenanced snapping nursery. The example admonitions elder children powerful instrument nursery discipline, long "sharp tongue" amongst little Skratdjs. But I doubt parents ever cured. I do not know heard story. Besides, bad habits easily cured one old. I fear Mr Mrs Skratdj yet got dance Dragons. CHAPTER TWO. OLD FATHER CHRISTMAS. "Can fancy, young people," said Godfather Garbel, winking his prominent eyes, moving his feet backwards forwards his square shoes, could hear squeak-leather half room off--"can fancy little boy, godmother? But I had, she sent presents birthdays too. And young people get presents I child get now. _Grumph_! We half many toys have, kept twice long.

But I say, I would rather put sea duck-pond, though best craft I could borrow pigsty-door, pole punt with, village boys jeering I got aground, time-- besides duck-pond never wave worth name, punt would, shallow could got drowned save life.

We sat long together one big footstool fire, arms round other, book resting knees, Kitty called blessings godmother's head sent volume kept us long mischief. "`If books allus useful that, they would me,' said she; though speech mean much, great deal Kitty say; since, herself educated person, she naturally thought `little enough good comes larning.' "Patty I favourites amongst pictures. Bogy, now, character one care think near bed-time. I tired Guy Fawkes, thought he looked natural made straw, Dick him. The Dunce little personal; Old Father Christmas took hearts storm; never seen anything like him, though now-a-days may get plaster figure toy-shop Christmas-time, hair beard like cotton-wool, Christmas-tree his hand. "The custom Christmas-trees came Germany. I remember first introduced England, wonderful things thought them. Now, every village school tree, scholars openly discuss whether presents `good,' `mean,' compared trees former years. "The first one I ever saw I believed come good Father Christmas himself; little boys grown wise taken amusement. They excited secret mysterious preparations back drawing-room; hardly confess thrill--which. I feel day--when folding-doors thrown open, amid blaze tapers, Mamma, like Fate, advances her scissors give every one falls his lot. "Well, young people, I eight years old I seen Christmas-tree, first picture one I ever saw picture held Old Father Christmas godmother's picture-book. "`What things tree?' I asked. "`Candles,' said father. "`No, father, candles; things?' "`Those toys, son.' "`Are ever taken off?' "`Yes, taken off, given children stand round tree.' "Patty I grasped hand, one voice murmured, `How kind Old Father Christmas!' "By-and-by I asked, `How old Father Christmas?' "My father laughed, said, `One thousand eight hundred thirty years, child,' year Lord, thus one thousand eight hundred thirty years since first great Christmas Day. "`He _looks_ old,' whispered Patty. "And I, was, age, Kitty called `Bible-learned,' said thoughtfully, puzzledness mind, `Then he is older Methuselah.' "But father left room, hear difficulty. "November December went by, still picture-book kept charm Patty me; pondered loved Old Father Christmas children love realise fancy friend. To remember fancies childhood I need say more. "Christmas week came, Christmas Eve came. My father mother mysteriously unaccountably busy parlour (we one parlour), Patty I allowed go in. We went kitchen, even place rest us. Kitty `all place,' she phrased it, cakes, mince-pies, puddings her. As she justly observed, `There place children books sit toes fire, body wanted oven along. The cat enough _her_ temper,' she added. "As puss, obstinately refused take hint drove her Christmas frost, she returned soft steps, stupidity was, I think, affected, warm hearth, fly intervals, like football, Kitty's hasty slipper. "We sense, less courage. We bowed Kitty's behests, went back door. "Patty I hardy children, accustomed `run out' weathers, without much extra wrapping up. We put Kitty's shawl two heads, went outside. I rather hoped see something Dick, holiday time; Dick passed. He busy helping his father bore holes carved seats church, hold sprigs holly morrow--that idea church decoration young days. You improved elders there, young people, I candid enough allow it. Still, sprigs red green better nothing, and, like lovely wreaths pious devices, made one feel old black wood bursting life leaf Christmas joy! "And, one knelt carefully, scratch his nose," added Godfather Garbel, chuckling rubbing his own, large rather red. "Well," he continued, "Dick busy, seen. We ran across little yard looked wall end see could see anything anybody. From point pleasant meadow field sloping prettily away little hill three-quarters mile distant; which, catching fine breezes moors beyond, held place cure whooping-cough, `kinkcough,' vulgarly called. Up top Kitty dragged me, carried Patty, recovering complaint, I well remember. It `change air' could afford, I dare say well gone badly-drained lodgings seaside. "This hill covered snow, stood grey sky. The white fields looked vast dreary dusk. The gay things seen red berries holly hedge, little lane--which, running end back-yard, led Hall-- fat robin redbreast staring me. I watching robin, Patty, peering her corner Kitty's shawl, gave great jump dragged shawl heads, cried,-- "`Look!'" CHAPTER FOUR. "I looked. An old man coming along lane. His hair beard white cotton-wool. He face like sort apple keeps well winter; his coat old brown. There snow patches, he carried small fir-tree. "The conviction seized upon us both. With one breath exclaimed, `_It's Old Father Christmas_!' "I know old man place, happen acquainted, he taking little fir-tree Hall, made Christmas-tree. He good-humoured old fellow, rather deaf, he made smiling nodding his head good deal, saying, `Aye, aye, _to_ sure!' likely intervals. "As he passed us met earnest gaze, he smiled nodded affably, I bold enough cry, `Good-evening, Father Christmas!' "`Same you!' said he, high-pitched voice. "`Then _are_ Father Christmas,' said Patty. "`And Happy New Year,' Father Christmas's reply, rather put out. But he smiled satisfactory manner, Patty went on, `You are old, are not you?' "`So I be, miss, I be,' said Father Christmas, nodding. "`Father says you are eighteen hundred thirty years old,' I muttered. "`Ay, ay, sure,' said Father Christmas, `I am long age.' "A _very_ long age, thought I, I added, `You are nearly twice old Methuselah, know,' thinking might struck him. "`Ay, ay,' said Father Christmas; he seem think anything it. After pause he held tree, cried, `D'ye know is, little miss?' "`A Christmas-tree,' said Patty. "And old man smiled nodded. "I leant wall, shouted, `But candles.' "`By-and-by,' said Father Christmas, nodding before. `When it is dark they will lighted up. That will fine sight!' "`Toys too, there will be, will not there?' screamed Patty. "Father Christmas nodded his head. `And sweeties,' he added, expressively. "I could feel Patty trembling, heart beat fast. The thought agitated us both, this--`Was Father Christmas bringing tree us?' But anxiety, modesty also, kept us asking outright. "Only old man shouldered his tree, prepared move on, I cried despair, `Oh, going?' "`I am coming back by-and-by,' said he. "`How soon?' cried Patty. "`About four of the clock,' said old man, smiling, `I am going yonder.' "And, nodding smiling he went, he passed away lane. "`Up yonder.' This puzzled us. Father Christmas pointed, indefinitely, he might pointing sky, fields, little wood end Squire's grounds. I thought latter, suggested Patty perhaps he place underground, like Aladdin's cave, he got candles, pretty things tree. This idea pleased us both, amused wondering Old Father Christmas would choose us his stores wonderful hole he dressed his Christmas-trees. "`I wonder, Patty,' said I, `why there is picture Father Christmas's dog book.' For old man's heels lane crept little brown white spaniel, looking dirty snow. "`Perhaps it is new dog he is got take care his cave,' said Patty. "When went indoors examined picture afresh dim light passage window, dog there. "My father passed us moment, patted head. `Father,' said I, `I do not know, I think Old Father Christmas going bring us Christmas-tree to-night.' "`Who is telling that?' said father. But he passed I could explain seen Father Christmas himself, his word he would return four of the clock, candles his tree would lighted soon dark. "We hovered outskirts rooms till four of the clock came. We sat stairs watched big clock, I learning read; Patty made herself giddy constantly looking counting four strokes, towards hour hand slowly moved. We put noses kitchen then, smell cakes get warm, anon hung parlour door, unjustly accused trying peep. What care mother parlour?--we seen Old Father Christmas himself, expecting back every moment! "At last church clock struck. The sounds boomed heavily frost, Patty thought four them. Then, due choking whirring, clock struck, counted strokes quite clearly--one! two! three! four! Then got Kitty's shawl more, stole back-yard. We ran old place, peeped, could see nothing. "`We would better get wall,' I said; difficulty distress rubbing her bare knees cold stones, getting snow her sleeves, Patty got coping little wall, I struggling her, something warm something cold coming suddenly bare calves legs, made shriek fright. I came `with run' bruised knees, elbows, chin; snow had not gone Patty's sleeves, went neck. Then I found cold thing dog's nose, warm thing his tongue; Patty cried her post observation, `It is Father Christmas's dog, he is licking legs.' "It really dirty little brown white spaniel; he persisted licking me, jumping me, making curious little noises, must meant something one known his language. I rather harassed moment. My legs sore, I little afraid dog, Patty much afraid sitting wall without me. "`You will not fall,' I said her. `Get down, you?' I said dog. "`Humpty Dumpty fell wall,' said Patty. "`Bow! wow!' said dog. "I pulled Patty down, dog tried pull down; little sister her feet, relief, he transferred his attentions her. When he jumped her, licked her several times, he turned round ran away. "`He is gone,' said I; `I am glad.' "But even I spoke he back again, crouching Patty's feet, glaring her eyes colour his ears. "Now Patty fond animals, dog looked her she looked dog, she said me, `He wants us go him.' "On (as he understood language, though ignorant his) spaniel sprang away, went hard he could; Patty I went him, dim hope crossing mind--`Perhaps Father Christmas sent us.' "This idea rather favoured fact dog led us lane. Only little way; he stopped something lying ditch--and cried breath, `It is Old Father Christmas!'" CHAPTER FIVE. "Returning Hall, old man slipped upon bit ice, lay stunned snow. "Patty began cry. `I think he is dead,' she sobbed. "`He old, I do not wonder,' I murmured; `but perhaps he is not. I will fetch Father.' "My father Kitty soon spot. Kitty strong man; carried Father Christmas kitchen. There he quickly revived. "I must Kitty justice say she utter word complaint disturbance her labours; she drew old man's chair close oven her hand. She much affected behaviour his dog, she admitted even hearth; puss, acute enough see matters stood, lay her back close spaniel's Kitty could expel one without kicking both. "For parts, felt sadly anxious tree; otherwise could wished better treat sit Kitty's round table taking tea Father Christmas. Our usual fare thick bread treacle to-night exchanged delicious variety cakes, none worse us `tasters wasters'--that is, little bits dough, shortbread, put try state oven, certain cakes got broken burnt baking. "Well, sat, helping Old Father Christmas tea cake, wondering hearts could become tree. But see, young people, I child, parents stricter now. Even Kitty died (and she dead many long year) change, she said `children got think anything became them.' I think taught honest shame certain things I often see little boys girls now. We ashamed boasting, greedy, selfish; ashamed asking anything offered us, interrupting grown-up people, talking ourselves. Why, papas mammas now-a-days seem quite proud let friends see bold greedy talkative children be! A lady said day, `You would not believe, Mr Garbel, forward dear little Harry his age. He his word everything, bit shy! his papa never comes home town Harry runs ask he is brought present. Papa says he will ruin him!' "`Madam,' said I, `even without word it, I quite aware child forward. He forward greedy intrusive, justly point out, I wish joy qualities fully developed. I think his father's fears well founded.' "But, bless me! now-a-days, it is `Come tell Mr Smith fine boy are, many houses build bricks,' or, `The dear child wants everything he sees,' `Little pet never let us Mamma alone minute; she, love?' But young days was, `Self praise recommendation' (as Kitty used tell me), or, `You are knocking hard Number One' (as father said talked ourselves), or, `Little boys seen heard' (as rule conduct `in company'), or, `Do not ask want, take what is given thankful.' "And see, young people, Patty I felt delicacy asking Old Father Christmas tree. It till tea three times round, tasters wasters match, Patty said gently, `It is quite dark now.' And she heaved deep sigh. "Burning anxiety overcame me. I leant towards Father Christmas, shouted--I found needful shout, `I suppose candles tree now?' "`Just putting  them on,' said Father Christmas. "`And presents, too?' said Patty. "`Ay, ay, _to_ sure,' said Father Christmas, he smiled delightfully. "I thinking farther questions I might venture upon, he pushed his cup towards Patty, saying, `Since pressing, miss, I will take another dish.' "And Kitty, swooping us oven, cried, `Make home, sir; there is came from. Make long arm, Miss Patty, hand cakes.' "So devote duties table; Patty, holding lid one hand pouring other, supplied Father Christmas's wants heavy heart. "At last he satisfied. I said grace, he stood, indeed he stood time afterwards his eyes shut--I fancy impression I still speaking. He said fervent `Amen,' reseated himself, father put his head kitchen, made remarkable statement,-- "`Old Father Christmas sent tree young people.' "Patty I uttered cry delight, forthwith danced round old man, saying, `Oh, nice! Oh, kind you!' I think must bewildered him, he smiled nodded. "`Come along,' said father. `Come children. Come Reuben. Come Kitty.' "And he went parlour, followed him. "My godmother's picture Christmas-tree pretty; flames candles naturally done red yellow, I always wondered shine night. But picture nothing reality. We sitting almost dark, for, Kitty said, `Firelight quite enough burn meal-times.' And parlour door thrown open, tree, lighted tapers branches, burst upon view, blaze dazzling, threw glory round little gifts, bags coloured muslin acid drops, pink rose drops, comfits inside, I shall never forget. We got something; Patty I, rate, believed things came stores Old Father Christmas. We undeceived even his gratefully accepting bundle old clothes hastily put together form his present. "We happy; even Kitty, I think, though she kept her sleeves rolled up, seemed rather grudge enjoying herself (a weak point energetic characters). She went back her oven lights out, angel top tree taken down. She locked her present (a little work-box) once. She often showed afterwards, kept bit tissue paper till she died. Our presents certainly last long! "The old man died week afterwards, never made his acquaintance common personage. When he buried, his little dog came us. I suppose he remembered hospitality he received. Patty adopted him, he faithful. Puss always looked favour. I hoped rambles together following summer he would lead us last cave Christmas-trees dressed. But he never did. "Our parents often spoke his late master `old Reuben,' children easily disabused favourite fancy, Patty's thoughts mine old man long gratefully remembered Old Father Christmas."
