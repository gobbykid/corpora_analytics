 LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY I Cedric knew nothing whatever it. It never even mentioned him. He knew his papa Englishman, his mamma told so; his papa died he little boy he could remember much him, except he big, blue eyes long mustache, splendid thing carried around room his shoulder. Since his papa's death, Cedric found best talk his mamma him. When his father ill, Cedric sent away, he returned, everything over; his mother, ill, too, beginning sit her chair window. She pale thin, dimples gone her pretty face, her eyes looked large mournful, she dressed black. “Dearest,” said Cedric (his papa called her always, little boy learned say it),--“dearest, papa better?” He felt her arms tremble, he turned his curly head looked her face. There something made feel he going cry. “Dearest,” he said, “is he well?” Then suddenly his loving little heart told he would better put his arms around her neck kiss her again, keep his soft cheek close hers; he so, she laid her face his shoulder cried bitterly, holding she could never let go again. “Yes, he well,” she sobbed; “he quite, quite well, we--we one left other. No one all.” Then, little he was, he understood his big, handsome young papa would come back more; he dead, he heard people being, although he could comprehend exactly strange thing brought sadness about. It his mamma always cried he spoke his papa he secretly made his mind better speak often her, he found out, too, better let her sit still look fire window without moving talking. He his mamma knew people, lived might thought lonely lives, although Cedric know lonely he grew older heard visitors. Then he told his mamma orphan, quite alone world his papa married her. She pretty, living companion rich old lady kind her, one day Captain Cedric Errol, calling house, saw her run stairs tears her eyelashes; she looked sweet innocent sorrowful Captain could forget her. And many strange things happened, knew well loved dearly, married, although marriage brought ill-will several persons. The one angry all, however, Captain's father, lived England, rich important old nobleman, bad temper violent dislike America Americans. He two sons older Captain Cedric; law elder sons inherit family title estates, rich splendid; eldest son died, next one would heir; so, though he member great family, little chance Captain Cedric would rich himself. But happened Nature given youngest son gifts she bestowed upon his elder brothers. He beautiful face fine, strong, graceful figure; he bright smile sweet, gay voice; he brave generous, kindest heart world, seemed power make every one love him. And his elder brothers; neither handsome, kind, clever. When boys Eton, popular; college, cared nothing study, wasted time money, made real friends. The old Earl, father, constantly disappointed humiliated them; his heir honor his noble name, promise end anything selfish, wasteful, insignificant man, manly noble qualities. It bitter, old Earl thought, son third, would small fortune, one gifts, charms, strength beauty. Sometimes he almost hated handsome young man he seemed good things gone stately title magnificent estates; yet, depths his proud, stubborn old heart, he could help caring much his youngest son. It one his fits petulance he sent travel America; he thought he would send away while, he made angry constantly contrasting his brothers, time giving great deal trouble wild ways. But, six months, he began feel lonely, longed secret see his son again, he wrote Captain Cedric ordered home. The letter he wrote crossed way letter Captain written his father, telling his love pretty American girl, his intended marriage; Earl received letter he furiously angry. Bad his temper was, he never given way his life he gave way he read Captain's letter. His valet, room came, thought his lordship would fit apoplexy, he wild anger. For hour he raged like tiger, he sat wrote his son, ordered never come near his old home, write his father brothers again. He told he might live he pleased, die he pleased, he cut his family forever, he need never expect help his father long he lived. The Captain sad he read letter; he fond England, he dearly loved beautiful home he born; he even loved his ill-tempered old father, sympathized his disappointments; he knew he need expect kindness future. At first he scarcely knew do; he brought work, business experience, he courage plenty determination. So he sold his commission English army, trouble found situation New York, married. The change his old life England great, he young happy, he hoped hard work would great things future. He small house quiet street, his little boy born there, everything gay cheerful, simple way, he never sorry moment he married rich old lady's pretty companion she sweet he loved her she loved him. She sweet, indeed, her little boy like her his father. Though he born quiet cheap little home, seemed never fortunate baby. In first place, he always well, he never gave one trouble; second place, he sweet temper ways charming he pleasure every one; third place, he beautiful look he quite picture. Instead bald-headed baby, he started life quantity soft, fine, gold-colored hair, curled ends, went loose rings time he six months old; he big brown eyes long eyelashes darling little face; he strong back splendid sturdy legs, nine months he learned suddenly walk; his manners good, baby, delightful make his acquaintance. He seemed feel every one his friend, one spoke him, he his carriage street, he would give stranger one sweet, serious look brown eyes, follow lovely, friendly smile; consequence was, person neighborhood quiet street he lived--even groceryman corner, considered crossest creature alive--who pleased see speak him. And every month his life he grew handsomer interesting. When he old enough walk his nurse, dragging small wagon wearing short white kilt skirt, big white hat set back his curly yellow hair, he handsome strong rosy he attracted every one's attention, his nurse would come home tell his mamma stories ladies stopped carriages look speak him, pleased he talked his cheerful little way, he known always. His greatest charm cheerful, fearless, quaint little way making friends people. I think arose his confiding nature, kind little heart sympathized every one, wished make every one comfortable he liked himself. It made quick understand feelings him. Perhaps grown him, too, he lived much his father mother, always loving considerate tender well-bred. He never heard unkind uncourteous word spoken home; he always loved caressed treated tenderly, his childish soul full kindness innocent warm feeling. He always heard his mamma called pretty, loving names, he used he spoke her; he always seen his papa watched her took great care her, he learned, too, careful her. So he knew his papa would come back more, saw sad his mamma was, gradually came his kind little heart thought he must he could make her happy. He much baby, thought his mind whenever he climbed upon her knee kissed her put his curly head her neck, he brought his toys picture-books show her, he curled quietly her side she used lie sofa. He old enough know anything else do, he he could, comfort her he could understood. “Oh, Mary!” he heard her say her old servant; “I sure he trying help his innocent way--I know he is. He looks sometimes loving, wondering little look, he sorry me, he come pet show something. He little man, I really think he knows.” As he grew older, he great many quaint little ways amused interested people greatly. He much companion his mother she scarcely cared other. They used walk together talk together play together. When he quite little fellow, he learned read; he used lie hearth-rug, evening, read aloud--sometimes stories, sometimes big books older people read, sometimes even newspaper; often times Mary, kitchen, would hear Mrs. Errol laughing delight quaint things he said. “And, indade,” said Mary groceryman, “nobody cud help laughin' quare little ways him--and his ould-fashioned sayin's! Did not he come kitchen noight new Prisident nominated shtand afore fire, lookin' loike pictur', wid his hands his shmall pockets, an' his innocent bit face sayrious jedge? An' sez he me: 'Mary,' sez he, 'I am much int'rusted 'lection,' sez he. 'I am 'publican, an' Dearest. Are 'publican, Mary?' 'Sorra bit,' sez I; 'I am bist dimmycrats!' An' he looks wid look ud go yer heart, an' sez he: 'Mary,' sez he, 'the country go ruin.' An' nivver day since thin he let go widout argyin' wid change polytics.” Mary fond him, proud him, too. She his mother ever since he born; and, his father's death, cook housemaid nurse everything else. She proud his graceful, strong little body his pretty manners, especially proud bright curly hair waved his forehead fell charming love-locks his shoulders. She willing work early late help his mamma make his small suits keep order. “'Ristycratic, it?” she would say. “Faith, an' I would loike see choild Fifth Avey-NOO looks loike an' shteps handsome himself. An' ivvery man, woman, choild lookin' afther his bit black velvet skirt made misthress's ould gownd; an' his little head up, an' his curly hair flyin' an' shinin'. It is loike young lord he looks.” Cedric know he looked like young lord; he know lord was. His greatest friend groceryman corner--the cross groceryman, never cross him. His name Mr. Hobbs, Cedric admired respected much. He thought rich powerful person, he many things his store,--prunes figs oranges biscuits,--and he horse wagon. Cedric fond milkman baker apple-woman, he liked Mr. Hobbs best all, terms intimacy he went see every day, often sat quite long time, discussing topics hour. It quite surprising many things found talk about--the Fourth July, instance. When began talk Fourth July really seemed end it. Mr. Hobbs bad opinion “the British,” he told whole story Revolution, relating wonderful patriotic stories villainy enemy bravery Revolutionary heroes, he even generously repeated part Declaration Independence. Cedric excited his eyes shone his cheeks red his curls rubbed tumbled yellow mop. He could hardly wait eat his dinner he went home, he anxious tell his mamma. It was, perhaps, Mr. Hobbs gave his first interest politics. Mr. Hobbs fond reading newspapers, Cedric heard great deal going Washington; Mr. Hobbs would tell whether President his duty not. And once, election, he found quite grand, probably Mr. Hobbs Cedric country might wrecked. Mr. Hobbs took see great torchlight procession, many men carried torches remembered afterward stout man stood near lamp-post held his shoulder handsome little shouting boy, waved his cap air. It long election, Cedric seven eight years old, strange thing happened made wonderful change his life. It quite curious, too, day happened he talking Mr. Hobbs England Queen, Mr. Hobbs said severe things aristocracy, specially indignant earls marquises. It hot morning; playing soldiers friends his, Cedric gone store rest, found Mr. Hobbs looking fierce piece Illustrated London News, contained picture court ceremony. “Ah,” he said, “that is way go now; they will get enough day, they have trod rise blow  them sky-high,--earls marquises all! It is coming, may look it!” Cedric perched usual high stool pushed his hat back, put his hands his pockets delicate compliment Mr. Hobbs. “Did ever know many marquises, Mr. Hobbs?” Cedric inquired,--“or earls?” “No,” answered Mr. Hobbs, indignation; “I guess not. I would like catch one  them inside here; that is all! I will grasping tyrants sittin' 'round cracker-barrels!” And he proud sentiment he looked around proudly mopped his forehead. “Perhaps would not earls knew better,” said Cedric, feeling vague sympathy unhappy condition. “Would not they!” said Mr. Hobbs. “They glory it! It is  them. They are bad lot.” They midst conversation, Mary appeared. Cedric thought she come buy sugar, perhaps, she not. She looked almost pale she excited something. “Come home, darlint,” she said; “the misthress wantin' yez.” Cedric slipped his stool. “Does she want go her, Mary?” he asked. “Good-morning, Mr. Hobbs. I will see again.” He surprised see Mary staring dumfounded fashion, he wondered she kept shaking her head. “What is matter, Mary?” he said. “Is hot weather?” “No,” said Mary; “but there is strange things happenin' us.” “Has sun given Dearest headache?” he inquired anxiously. But that. When he reached his house coupe standing door one little parlor talking his mamma. Mary hurried upstairs put his best summer suit cream-colored flannel, red scarf around his waist, combed his curly locks. “Lords, it?” he heard her say. “An' nobility an' gintry. Och! bad cess them! Lords, indade--worse luck.” It really puzzling, he felt sure his mamma would tell excitement meant, he allowed Mary bemoan herself without asking many questions. When he dressed, he ran downstairs went parlor. A tall, thin old gentleman sharp face sitting arm-chair. His mother standing near pale face, he saw tears her eyes. “Oh! Ceddie!” she cried out, ran her little boy caught her arms kissed frightened, troubled way. “Oh! Ceddie, darling!” The tall old gentleman rose his chair looked Cedric his sharp eyes. He rubbed his thin chin his bony hand he looked. He seemed displeased. “And so,” he said last, slowly,--“and little Lord Fauntleroy.” II There never amazed little boy Cedric week followed; never strange unreal week. In first place, story his mamma told curious one. He obliged hear two three times he could understand it. He could imagine Mr. Hobbs would think it. It began earls: his grandpapa, he never seen, earl; his eldest uncle, he killed fall his horse, would earl, too, time; his death, his uncle would earl, he died suddenly, Rome, fever. After that, his papa, he lived, would earl, but, since died Cedric left, appeared HE earl his grandpapa's death--and present he Lord Fauntleroy. He turned quite pale he first told it. “Oh! Dearest!” he said, “I rather earl. None boys earls. Cannot I NOT one?” But seemed unavoidable. And when, evening, sat together open window looking shabby street, he his mother long talk it. Cedric sat his footstool, clasping one knee his favorite attitude wearing bewildered little face rather red exertion thinking. His grandfather sent come England, his mamma thought he must go. “Because,” she said, looking window sorrowful eyes, “I know papa would wish so, Ceddie. He loved his home much; many things thought little boy cannot quite understand. I selfish little mother I send you. When man, see why.” Ceddie shook his head mournfully. “I shall sorry leave Mr. Hobbs,” he said. “I am afraid he will miss me, I shall miss him. And I shall miss all.” When Mr. Havisham--who family lawyer Earl Dorincourt, sent bring Lord Fauntleroy England--came next day, Cedric heard many things. But, somehow, console hear he rich man he grew up, he would castles castles there, great parks deep mines grand estates tenantry. He troubled his friend, Mr. Hobbs, he went see store soon breakfast, great anxiety mind. He found reading morning paper, he approached grave demeanor. He really felt would great shock Mr. Hobbs hear befallen him, his way store he thinking would best break news. “Hello!” said Mr. Hobbs. “Mornin'!” “Good-morning,” said Cedric. He climb high stool usual, sat cracker-box clasped his knee, silent moments Mr. Hobbs finally looked inquiringly top his newspaper. “Hello!” he said again. Cedric gathered his strength mind together. “Mr. Hobbs,” he said, “do remember talking yesterday morning?” “Well,” replied Mr. Hobbs,--“seems England.” “Yes,” said Cedric; “but Mary came me, know?” Mr. Hobbs rubbed back his head. “We WAS mentioning Queen Victoria aristocracy.” “Yes,” said Cedric, rather hesitatingly, “and--and earls; do not know?” “Why, yes,” returned Mr. Hobbs; “we DID touch  them little; that is so!” Cedric flushed curly bang his forehead. Nothing embarrassing ever happened his life. He little afraid might trifle embarrassing Mr. Hobbs, too. “You said,” he proceeded, “that would not sitting 'round cracker-barrels.” “So I did!” returned Mr. Hobbs, stoutly. “And I meant it. Let  them try it--that is all!” “Mr. Hobbs,” said Cedric, “one sitting box now!” Mr. Hobbs almost jumped his chair. “What!” he exclaimed. “Yes,” Cedric announced, due modesty; “_I_ one--or I going be. I will not deceive you.” Mr. Hobbs looked agitated. He rose suddenly went look thermometer. “The mercury's got head!” he exclaimed, turning back examine his young friend's countenance. “It IS hot day! How feel? Got pain? When begin feel way?” He put his big hand little boy's hair. This embarrassing ever. “Thank you,” said Ceddie; “I am right. There nothing matter head. I am sorry say it is true, Mr. Hobbs. That Mary came take home for. Mr. Havisham telling mamma, he lawyer.” Mr. Hobbs sank his chair mopped his forehead his handkerchief. “ONE us got sunstroke!” he exclaimed. “No,” returned Cedric, “we have not. We shall make best it, Mr. Hobbs. Mr. Havisham came way England tell us it. My grandpapa sent him.” Mr. Hobbs stared wildly innocent, serious little face him. “Who grandfather?” he asked. Cedric put his hand his pocket carefully drew piece paper, something written his round, irregular hand. “I could not easily remember it, I wrote this,” he said. And he read aloud slowly: “'John Arthur Molyneux Errol, Earl Dorincourt.' That his name, he lives castle--in two three castles, I think. And papa, died, his youngest son; I should not lord earl papa had not died; papa would not earl his two brothers had not died. But died, one me,--no boy,--and I one; grandpapa sent come England.” Mr. Hobbs seemed grow hotter hotter. He mopped his forehead his bald spot breathed hard. He began see something remarkable happened; he looked little boy sitting cracker-box, innocent, anxious expression his childish eyes, saw he changed all, simply he day before, handsome, cheerful, brave little fellow blue suit red neck-ribbon, information nobility bewildered him. He bewildered Cedric gave ingenuous simplicity, plainly without realizing stupendous was. “Wha--what say name was?” Mr. Hobbs inquired. “It is Cedric Errol, Lord Fauntleroy,” answered Cedric. “That Mr. Havisham called me. He said I went room: 'And little Lord Fauntleroy!'” “Well,” said Mr. Hobbs, “I will be--jiggered!” This exclamation he always used he much astonished excited. He could think nothing else say puzzling moment. Cedric felt quite proper suitable ejaculation. His respect affection Mr. Hobbs great he admired approved his remarks. He seen enough society yet make realize sometimes Mr. Hobbs quite conventional. He knew, course, he different his mamma, but, then, his mamma lady, he idea ladies always different gentlemen. He looked Mr. Hobbs wistfully. “England long way off, is not it?” he asked. “It is across Atlantic Ocean,” Mr. Hobbs answered. “That is worst it,” said Cedric. “Perhaps I shall see long time. I do not like think that, Mr. Hobbs.” “The best friends must part,” said Mr. Hobbs. “Well,” said Cedric, “we friends great many years, have not we?” “Ever since born,” Mr. Hobbs answered. “You six weeks old first walked street.” “Ah,” remarked Cedric, sigh, “I never thought I earl then!” “You think,” said Mr. Hobbs, “there is getting it?” “I am afraid not,” answered Cedric. “My mamma says papa would wish it. But I earl, there is one thing I do: I try good one. I am going tyrant. And ever another war America, I shall try stop it.” His conversation Mr. Hobbs long serious one. Once got first shock, Mr. Hobbs rancorous might expected; he endeavored resign situation, interview end he asked great many questions. As Cedric could answer them, he endeavored answer himself, and, fairly launched subject earls marquises lordly estates, explained many things way would probably astonished Mr. Havisham, could gentleman heard it. But many things astonished Mr. Havisham. He spent his life England, accustomed American people American habits. He connected professionally family Earl Dorincourt nearly forty years, he knew grand estates great wealth importance; and, cold, business-like way, he felt interest little boy, who, future, master owner all,--the future Earl Dorincourt. He known old Earl's disappointment his elder sons his fierce rage Captain Cedric's American marriage, he knew he still hated gentle little widow would speak her except bitter cruel words. He insisted she common American girl, entrapped his son marrying her she knew he earl's son. The old lawyer half believed true. He seen great many selfish, mercenary people his life, he good opinion Americans. When he driven cheap street, his coupe stopped cheap, small house, he felt actually shocked. It seemed really quite dreadful think future owner Dorincourt Castle Wyndham Towers Chorlworth, stately splendors, born brought insignificant house street sort green-grocery corner. He wondered kind child he would be, kind mother he had. He rather shrank seeing both. He sort pride noble family whose legal affairs he conducted long, would annoyed much found obliged manage woman would seem vulgar, money-loving person, respect her dead husband's country dignity his name. It old name splendid one, Mr. Havisham great respect himself, though he cold, keen, business-like old lawyer. When Mary handed small parlor, he looked around critically. It plainly furnished, home-like look; cheap, common ornaments, cheap, gaudy pictures; adornments walls good taste room many pretty things woman's hand might made. “Not bad far,” he said himself; “but perhaps Captain's taste predominated.” But Mrs. Errol came room, he began think she herself might something it. If he quite self-contained stiff old gentleman, he would probably started he saw her. She looked, simple black dress, fitting closely her slender figure, like young girl mother boy seven. She pretty, sorrowful, young face, tender, innocent look her large brown eyes,--the sorrowful look never quite left her face since her husband died. Cedric used seeing there; times he ever seen fade he playing her talking her, said old-fashioned thing, used long word he picked newspapers his conversations Mr. Hobbs. He fond using long words, he always pleased made her laugh, though he could understand laughable; quite serious matters him. The lawyer's experience taught read people's characters shrewdly, soon he saw Cedric's mother he knew old Earl made great mistake thinking her vulgar, mercenary woman. Mr. Havisham never married, he never even love, he divined pretty young creature sweet voice sad eyes married Captain Errol she loved her affectionate heart, she never thought advantage he earl's son. And he saw he trouble her, he began feel perhaps little Lord Fauntleroy might trial his noble family, all. The Captain handsome fellow, young mother pretty, perhaps boy might well enough look at. When he first told Mrs. Errol he come for, she turned pale. “Oh!” she said; “will he taken away me? We love much! He happiness me! He I have. I tried good mother him.” And her sweet young voice trembled, tears rushed her eyes. “You know he me!” she said. The lawyer cleared his throat. “I obliged tell you,” he said, “that Earl Dorincourt not--is friendly toward you. He old man, his prejudices strong. He always especially disliked America Americans, much enraged his son's marriage. I sorry bearer unpleasant communication, he fixed his determination see you. His plan Lord Fauntleroy shall educated his supervision; he shall live him. The Earl attached Dorincourt Castle, spends great deal time there. He victim inflammatory gout, fond London. Lord Fauntleroy will, therefore, likely live chiefly Dorincourt. The Earl offers home Court Lodge, situated pleasantly, far castle. He also offers suitable income. Lord Fauntleroy permitted visit you; stipulation is, shall visit enter park gates. You see really separated son, I assure you, madam, terms harsh as--as might been. The advantage surroundings education Lord Fauntleroy have, I sure must see, great.” He felt little uneasy lest she begin cry make scene, he knew women would done. It embarrassed annoyed see women cry. But she not. She went window stood her face turned away moments, he saw she trying steady herself. “Captain Errol fond Dorincourt,” she said last. “He loved England, everything English. It always grief he parted his home. He proud his home, his name. He would wish--I know he would wish his son know beautiful old places, brought way would suitable his future position.” Then she came back table stood looking Mr. Havisham gently. “My husband would wish it,” she said. “It best little boy. I know--I sure Earl would unkind try teach love me; I know--even he tried--that little boy much like his father harmed. He warm, faithful nature, true heart. He would love even he see me; long may see other, I ought suffer much.” “She thinks little herself,” lawyer thought. “She make terms herself.” “Madam,” he said aloud, “I respect consideration son. He thank he man. I assure Lord Fauntleroy carefully guarded, every effort used insure his happiness. The Earl Dorincourt anxious his comfort well-being could be.” “I hope,” said tender little mother, rather broken voice, “that his grandfather love Ceddie. The little boy affectionate nature; he always loved.” Mr. Havisham cleared his throat again. He could quite imagine gouty, fiery-tempered old Earl loving one much; he knew would his interest kind, his irritable way, child his heir. He knew, too, Ceddie credit his name, his grandfather would proud him. “Lord Fauntleroy comfortable, I sure,” he replied. “It view his happiness Earl desired near enough see frequently.” He think would discreet repeat exact words Earl used, fact neither polite amiable. Mr. Havisham preferred express his noble patron's offer smoother courteous language. He another slight shock Mrs. Errol asked Mary find her little boy bring her, Mary told her he was. “Sure I will foind aisy enough, madam,” she said; “for it is wid Mr. Hobbs he minnit, settin' his high shtool counther an' talkin' pollytics, loikely, enj'yin' hisself among soap an' candles an' pertaties, sinsible an' shwate ye plase.” “Mr. Hobbs known his life,” Mrs. Errol said lawyer. “He kind Ceddie, great friendship them.” Remembering glimpse he caught store he passed it, recollection barrels potatoes apples various odds ends, Mr. Havisham felt his doubts arise again. In England, gentlemen's sons make friends grocerymen, seemed rather singular proceeding. It would awkward child bad manners disposition like low company. One bitterest humiliations old Earl's life his two elder sons fond low company. Could be, he thought, boy shared bad qualities instead his father's good qualities? He thinking uneasily he talked Mrs. Errol child came room. When door opened, he actually hesitated moment looking Cedric. It would, perhaps, seemed queer great many people knew him, could known curious sensations passed Mr. Havisham he looked boy, ran his mother's arms. He experienced revulsion feeling quite exciting. He recognized instant one finest handsomest little fellows he ever seen. His beauty something unusual. He strong, lithe, graceful little body manly little face; he held his childish head up, carried brave air; he like his father really startling; he his father's golden hair his mother's brown eyes, nothing sorrowful timid them. They innocently fearless eyes; he looked he never feared doubted anything his life. “He best-bred-looking handsomest little fellow I ever saw,” Mr. Havisham thought. What he said aloud simply, “And little Lord Fauntleroy.” And, this, he saw little Lord Fauntleroy, surprise he found him. He knew little children, though he seen plenty England--fine, handsome, rosy girls boys, strictly taken care tutors governesses, sometimes shy, sometimes trifle boisterous, never interesting ceremonious, rigid old lawyer. Perhaps his personal interest little Lord Fauntleroy's fortunes made notice Ceddie he noticed children; but, however was, he certainly found noticing great deal. Cedric know he observed, he behaved his ordinary manner. He shook hands Mr. Havisham his friendly way introduced other, he answered his questions unhesitating readiness he answered Mr. Hobbs. He neither shy bold, Mr. Havisham talking his mother, lawyer noticed he listened conversation much interest he quite grown up. “He seems mature little fellow,” Mr. Havisham said mother. “I think he is, things,” she answered. “He always quick learn, he lived great deal grownup people. He funny little habit using long words expressions he read books, heard others use, he fond childish play. I think he rather clever, he boyish little boy, sometimes.” The next time Mr. Havisham met him, he saw last quite true. As his coupe turned corner, he caught sight group small boys, evidently much excited. Two run race, one his young lordship, he shouting making much noise noisiest his companions. He stood side side another boy, one little red leg advanced step. “One, make ready!” yelled starter. “Two, steady. Three--and away!” Mr. Havisham found leaning window his coupe curious feeling interest. He really never remembered seen anything quite like way his lordship's lordly little red legs flew behind his knickerbockers tore ground he shot race signal word. He shut his small hands set his face wind; his bright hair streamed behind. “Hooray, Ced Errol!” boys shouted, dancing shrieking excitement. “Hooray, Billy Williams! Hooray, Ceddie! Hooray, Billy! Hooray! 'Ray! 'Ray!” “I really believe he going win,” said Mr. Havisham. The way red legs flew flashed down, shrieks boys, wild efforts Billy Williams, whose brown legs despised, followed closely rear red legs, made feel excitement. “I really--I really cannot help hoping he win!” he said, apologetic sort cough. At moment, wildest yell went dancing, hopping boys. With one last frantic leap future Earl Dorincourt reached lamp-post end block touched it, two seconds Billy Williams flung it, panting. “Three cheers Ceddie Errol!” yelled little boys. “Hooray Ceddie Errol!” Mr. Havisham drew his head window his coupe leaned back dry smile. “Bravo, Lord Fauntleroy!” he said. As his carriage stopped door Mrs. Errol's house, victor vanquished coming toward it, attended clamoring crew. Cedric walked Billy Williams speaking him. His elated little face red, his curls clung his hot, moist forehead, his hands his pockets. “You see,” he saying, evidently intention making defeat easy his unsuccessful rival, “I guess I legs little longer yours. I guess it. You see, I am three days older you, gives 'vantage. I am three days older.” And view case seemed cheer Billy Williams much he began smile world again, felt able swagger little, almost he race instead losing it. Somehow, Ceddie Errol way making people feel comfortable. Even first flush his triumphs, he remembered person beaten might feel gay he did, might like think he MIGHT winner different circumstances. That morning Mr. Havisham quite long conversation winner race--a conversation made smile his dry smile, rub his chin his bony hand several times. Mrs. Errol called parlor, lawyer Cedric left together. At first Mr. Havisham wondered he say his small companion. He idea perhaps would best say several things might prepare Cedric meeting his grandfather, and, perhaps, great change come him. He could see Cedric least idea sort thing he see he reached England, sort home waited there. He even know yet his mother live house him. They thought best let get first shock telling him. Mr. Havisham sat arm-chair one side open window; side another still larger chair, Cedric sat looked Mr. Havisham. He sat well back depths his big seat, his curly head cushioned back, his legs crossed, his hands thrust deep his pockets, quite Mr. Hobbs-like way. He watching Mr. Havisham steadily his mamma room, she gone he still looked respectful thoughtfulness. There short silence Mrs. Errol went out, Cedric seemed studying Mr. Havisham, Mr. Havisham certainly studying Cedric. He could make his mind elderly gentleman say little boy races, wore short knickerbockers red stockings legs long enough hang big chair he sat well back it. But Cedric relieved suddenly beginning conversation himself. “Do know,” he said, “I do not know earl is?” “Do not you?” said Mr. Havisham. “No,” replied Ceddie. “And I think boy going one, he ought know. Do not you?” “Well--yes,” answered Mr. Havisham. “Would mind,” said Ceddie respectfully--“would mind 'splaining me?” (Sometimes he used his long words he pronounce quite correctly.) “What made earl?” “A king queen, first place,” said Mr. Havisham. “Generally, he made earl he done service his sovereign, great deed.” “Oh!” said Cedric; “that is like President.” “Is it?” said Mr. Havisham. “Is presidents elected?” “Yes,” answered Ceddie cheerfully. “When man good knows great deal, he elected president. They torch-light processions bands, everybody makes speeches. I used think I might perhaps president, I never thought earl. I did not know earls,” he said, rather hastily, lest Mr. Havisham might feel impolite wished one,--“if I would known them, I dare say I thought I like one.” “It rather different president,” said Mr. Havisham. “Is it?” asked Cedric. “How? Are torch-light processions?” Mr. Havisham crossed his legs put tips his fingers carefully together. He thought perhaps time come explain matters rather clearly. “An earl is--is important person,” he began. “So president!” put Ceddie. “The torch-light processions five miles long, shoot rockets, band plays! Mr. Hobbs took see them.” “An earl,” Mr. Havisham went on, feeling rather uncertain his ground, “is frequently ancient lineage----” “What is that?” asked Ceddie. “Of old family--extremely old.” “Ah!” said Cedric, thrusting his hands deeper his pockets. “I suppose way apple-woman near park. I dare say she ancient lin-lenage. She old would surprise she stand up. She is hundred, I think, yet she rains, even. I am sorry her, boys. Billy Williams nearly dollar, I asked buy five cents' worth apples her every day he spent all. That made twenty days, he grew tired apples week; then--it quite fortunate--a gentleman gave fifty cents I bought apples her instead. You feel sorry one that is poor ancient lin-lenage. She says gone her bones rain makes worse.” Mr. Havisham felt rather loss he looked his companion's innocent, serious little face. “I afraid quite understand me,” he explained. “When I said 'ancient lineage' I mean old age; I meant name family known world long time; perhaps hundreds years persons bearing name known spoken history country.” “Like George Washington,” said Ceddie. “I have heard ever since I born, he known about, long that. Mr. Hobbs says he never forgotten. That is Declaration Independence, know, Fourth July. You see, he brave man.” “The first Earl Dorincourt,” said Mr. Havisham solemnly, “was created earl four hundred years ago.” “Well, well!” said Ceddie. “That long time ago! Did tell Dearest that? It would int'rust her much. We will tell her she comes in. She always likes hear cur'us things. What else earl besides created?” “A great many helped govern England. Some brave men fought great battles old days.” “I like myself,” said Cedric. “My papa soldier, he brave man--as brave George Washington. Perhaps he would earl he had not died. I glad earls brave. That is great 'vantage--to brave man. Once I used rather afraid things--in dark, know; I thought soldiers Revolution George Washington--it cured me.” “There another advantage earl, sometimes,” said Mr. Havisham slowly, he fixed his shrewd eyes little boy rather curious expression. “Some earls great deal money.” He curious he wondered his young friend knew power money was. “That is good thing have,” said Ceddie innocently. “I wish I great deal money.” “Do you?” said Mr. Havisham. “And why?” “Well,” explained Cedric, “there many things person money. You see, there is apple-woman. If I rich I buy her little tent put her stall in, little stove, I give her dollar every morning rained, she could afford stay home. And then--oh! I would give her shawl. And, see, her bones would not feel badly. Her bones like bones; hurt her she moves. It is painful bones hurt you. If I rich enough things her, I guess her bones would right.” “Ahem!” said Mr. Havisham. “And else would rich?” “Oh! I would great many things. Of course I buy Dearest sorts beautiful things, needle-books fans gold thimbles rings, encyclopedia, carriage, she need not wait street-cars. If she liked pink silk dresses, I buy her some, she likes black best. But I would, take her big stores, tell her look 'round choose herself. And Dick----” “Who Dick?” asked Mr. Havisham. “Dick boot-black,” said his young lordship, quite warming his interest plans exciting. “He one nicest boot-blacks ever knew. He stands corner street down-town. I have known years. Once I little, I walking Dearest, she bought beautiful ball bounced, I carrying bounced middle street carriages horses were, I disappointed, I began cry--I little. I kilts on. And Dick blacking man's shoes, he said 'Hello!' he ran horses caught ball wiped his coat gave said, 'It is right, young un.' So Dearest admired much, I, ever since then, go down-town, talk him. He says 'Hello!' I say 'Hello!' talk little, he tells trade is. It is bad lately.” “And would like him?” inquired lawyer, rubbing his chin smiling queer smile. “Well,” said Lord Fauntleroy, settling his chair business air, “I would buy Jake out.” “And Jake?” Mr. Havisham asked. “He is Dick's partner, he worst partner fellow could have! Dick says so. He is not credit business, he is not square. He cheats, makes Dick mad. It would make mad, know, blacking boots hard could, square time, partner was not square all. People like Dick, do not like Jake, sometimes do not come twice. So I rich, I would buy Jake get Dick 'boss' sign--he says 'boss' sign goes long way; I would get new clothes new brushes, start fair. He says he wants start fair.” There could nothing confiding innocent way his small lordship told his little story, quoting his friend Dick's bits slang candid good faith. He seemed feel shade doubt his elderly companion would interested he himself. And truth Mr. Havisham beginning greatly interested; perhaps quite much Dick apple-woman kind little lordling, whose curly head busy, yellow thatch, good-natured plans his friends, seemed somehow forgotten altogether. “Is anything----” he began. “What would get yourself, rich?” “Lots things!” answered Lord Fauntleroy briskly; “but first I would give Mary money Bridget--that is her sister, twelve children, husband work. She comes cries, Dearest gives her things basket, she cries again, says: 'Blessin's yez, beautiful lady.' And I think Mr. Hobbs would like gold watch chain remember by, meerschaum pipe. And I would like get company.” “A company!” exclaimed Mr. Havisham. “Like Republican rally,” explained Cedric, becoming quite excited. “I would torches uniforms things boys myself, too. And we would march, know, drill. That is I like myself, I rich.” The door opened Mrs. Errol came in. “I sorry obliged leave long,” she said Mr. Havisham; “but poor woman, great trouble, came see me.” “This young gentleman,” said Mr. Havisham, “has telling his friends, he would he rich.” “Bridget one his friends,” said Mrs. Errol; “and Bridget I talking kitchen. She great trouble her husband rheumatic fever.” Cedric slipped his big chair. “I think I will go see her,” he said, “and ask her he is. He is nice man he well. I am obliged he made sword wood. He is talented man.” He ran room, Mr. Havisham rose his chair. He seemed something his mind he wished speak of. He hesitated moment, said, looking Mrs. Errol: “Before I left Dorincourt Castle, I interview Earl, he gave instructions. He desirous his grandson look forward pleasure his future life England, also his acquaintance himself. He said I must let his lordship know change his life would bring money pleasures children enjoy; he expressed wishes, I gratify them, tell his grand-father given he wished. I aware Earl expect anything quite like this; would give Lord Fauntleroy pleasure assist poor woman, I feel Earl would displeased he gratified.” For second time, he repeat Earl's exact words. His lordship had, indeed, said: “Make lad understand I give anything he wants. Let know grandson Earl Dorincourt. Buy everything he takes fancy to; let money his pockets, tell his grandfather put there.” His motives far good, he dealing nature less affectionate warm-hearted little Lord Fauntleroy's, great harm might done. And Cedric's mother gentle suspect harm. She thought perhaps meant lonely, unhappy old man, whose children dead, wished kind her little boy, win his love confidence. And pleased her much think Ceddie would able help Bridget. It made her happier know first result strange fortune befallen her little boy he could kind things needed kindness. Quite warm color bloomed her pretty young face. “Oh!” she said, “that kind Earl; Cedric glad! He always fond Bridget Michael. They quite deserving. I often wished I able help more. Michael hard-working man he well, he ill long time needs expensive medicines warm clothing nourishing food. He Bridget wasteful given them.” Mr. Havisham put his thin hand his breast pocket drew forth large pocket-book. There queer look his keen face. The truth was, he wondering Earl Dorincourt would say he told first wish his grandson granted. He wondered cross, worldly, selfish old nobleman would think it. “I know realized,” he said, “that Earl Dorincourt exceedingly rich man. He afford gratify caprice. I think would please know Lord Fauntleroy indulged fancy. If call back allow me, I shall give five pounds people.” “That would twenty-five dollars!” exclaimed Mrs. Errol. “It seem like wealth them. I scarcely believe true.” “It quite true,” said Mr. Havisham, his dry smile. “A great change taken place son's life, great deal power lie his hands.” “Oh!” cried his mother. “And he little boy--a little boy. How I teach use well? It makes half afraid. My pretty little Ceddie!” The lawyer slightly cleared his throat. It touched his worldly, hard old heart see tender, timid look her brown eyes. “I think, madam,” he said, “that I may judge interview Lord Fauntleroy morning, next Earl Dorincourt think others well his noble self. He child yet, I think he may trusted.” Then his mother went Cedric brought back parlor. Mr. Havisham heard talking he entered room. “It is infam-natory rheumatism,” he saying, “and that is kind rheumatism that is dreadful. And he thinks rent paid, Bridget says makes inf'ammation worse. And Pat could get place store he clothes.” His little face looked quite anxious he came in. He sorry Bridget. “Dearest said wanted me,” he said Mr. Havisham. “I have talking Bridget.” Mr. Havisham looked moment. He felt little awkward undecided. As Cedric's mother said, he little boy. “The Earl Dorincourt----” he began, he glanced involuntarily Mrs. Errol. Little Lord Fauntleroy's mother suddenly kneeled put her tender arms around his childish body. “Ceddie,” she said, “the Earl grandpapa, papa's father. He very, kind, he loves wishes love him, sons his little boys dead. He wishes happy make people happy. He rich, he wishes everything would like have. He told Mr. Havisham so, gave great deal money you. You give Bridget now; enough pay her rent buy Michael everything. Is not fine, Ceddie? Is not he good?” And she kissed child his round cheek, bright color suddenly flashed his excited amazement. He looked his mother Mr. Havisham. “Can I now?” he cried. “Can I give her minute? She is going.” Mr. Havisham handed money. It fresh, clean greenbacks made neat roll. Ceddie flew room it. “Bridget!” heard shout, he tore kitchen. “Bridget, wait minute! Here is money. It is you, pay rent. My grandpapa gave me. It is Michael!” “Oh, Master Ceddie!” cried Bridget, awe-stricken voice. “It is twinty-foive dollars here. Where be's misthress?” “I think I shall go explain her,” Mrs. Errol said. So she, too, went room Mr. Havisham left alone while. He went window stood looking street reflectively. He thinking old Earl Dorincourt, sitting his great, splendid, gloomy library castle, gouty lonely, surrounded grandeur luxury, really loved one, his long life he never really loved one himself; he selfish self-indulgent arrogant passionate; he cared much Earl Dorincourt his pleasures time think people; his wealth power, benefits his noble name high rank, seemed things used amuse give pleasure Earl Dorincourt; he old man, excitement self-indulgence brought ill health irritability dislike world, certainly disliked him. In spite his splendor, never unpopular old nobleman Earl Dorincourt, could scarcely lonely one. He could fill his castle guests he chose. He could give great dinners splendid hunting parties; he knew secret people would accept his invitations afraid his frowning old face sarcastic, biting speeches. He cruel tongue bitter nature, he took pleasure sneering people making feel uncomfortable, he power so, sensitive proud timid. Mr. Havisham knew his hard, fierce ways heart, he thinking he looked window narrow, quiet street. And rose his mind, sharp contrast, picture cheery, handsome little fellow sitting big chair telling his story his friends, Dick apple-woman, his generous, innocent, honest way. And he thought immense income, beautiful, majestic estates, wealth, power good evil, course time would lie small, chubby hands little Lord Fauntleroy thrust deep his pockets. “It make great difference,” he said himself. “It make great difference.” Cedric his mother came back soon after. Cedric high spirits. He sat his chair, his mother lawyer, fell one his quaint attitudes, his hands his knees. He glowing enjoyment Bridget's relief rapture. “She cried!” he said. “She said she crying joy! I never saw one cry joy before. My grandpapa must good man. I did not know he good man. It is more--more agreeabler earl I thought was. I am almost glad--I am almost QUITE glad I am going one.” III Cedric's good opinion advantages earl increased greatly next week. It seemed almost impossible realize scarcely anything he might wish he could easily; fact, I think may said he fully realize all. But least he understood, conversations Mr. Havisham, he could gratify his nearest wishes, he proceeded gratify simplicity delight caused Mr. Havisham much diversion. In week sailed England he many curious things. The lawyer long remembered morning went down-town together pay visit Dick, afternoon amazed apple-woman ancient lineage stopping her stall telling her she tent, stove, shawl, sum money seemed her quite wonderful. “For I go England lord,” explained Cedric, sweet-temperedly. “And I should not like bones mind every time rained. My bones never hurt, I think I do not know painful person's bones be, I have sympathized great deal, I hope you will better.” “She is good apple-woman,” he said Mr. Havisham, walked away, leaving proprietress stall almost gasping breath, believing her great fortune. “Once, I fell cut knee, she gave apple nothing. I have always remembered her it. You know always remember people kind you.” It never occurred his honest, simple little mind people could forget kindnesses. The interview Dick quite exciting. Dick great deal trouble Jake, low spirits saw him. His amazement Cedric calmly announced come give seemed great thing him, would set his troubles right, almost struck dumb. Lord Fauntleroy's manner announcing object his visit simple unceremonious. Mr. Havisham much impressed directness he stood listened. The statement his old friend become lord, danger earl he lived long enough, caused Dick open his eyes mouth, start, his cap fell off. When he picked up, he uttered rather singular exclamation. Mr. Havisham thought singular, Cedric heard before. “I soy!” he said, “what are yer givin' us?” This plainly embarrassed his lordship little, he bore bravely. “Everybody thinks true first,” he said. “Mr. Hobbs thought I would sunstroke. I did not think I going like myself, I like better I am used it. The one Earl now, he is grandpapa; he wants anything I like. He is kind, he IS earl; he sent lot money Mr. Havisham, I have brought buy Jake out.” And end matter Dick actually bought Jake out, found possessor business new brushes astonishing sign outfit. He could believe his good luck easily apple-woman ancient lineage could believe hers; he walked like boot-black dream; he stared his young benefactor felt he might wake moment. He scarcely seemed realize anything Cedric put his hand shake hands going away. “Well, good-bye,” he said; though he tried speak steadily, little tremble his voice he winked his big brown eyes. “And I hope trade'll good. I am sorry I am going away leave you, perhaps I shall come back I am earl. And I wish you would write me, always good friends. And write me, here is must send letter.” And he gave slip paper. “And name is not Cedric Errol more; it is Lord Fauntleroy and--and good-bye, Dick.” Dick winked his eyes also, yet looked rather moist lashes. He educated boot-black, he would found difficult tell he felt he tried; perhaps he did not try, winked his eyes swallowed lump his throat. “I wish ye was not going away,” he said husky voice. Then he winked his eyes again. Then he looked Mr. Havisham, touched his cap. “Thanky, sir, fur bringin' an' fur wot ye've done, He is--he is queer little feller,” he added. “I have allers thort heap him. He is game little feller, an'--an' queer little un.” And turned away he stood looked dazed kind way, still mist his eyes, lump his throat, he watched gallant little figure marching gayly along side tall, rigid escort. Until day his departure, his lordship spent much time possible Mr. Hobbs store. Gloom settled upon Mr. Hobbs; he much depressed spirits. When his young friend brought triumph parting gift gold watch chain, Mr. Hobbs found difficult acknowledge properly. He laid case his stout knee, blew his nose violently several times. “There is something written it,” said Cedric,--“inside case. I told man say. 'From his oldest friend, Lord Fauntleroy, Mr. Hobbs. When see, remember me.' I do not want forget me.” Mr. Hobbs blew his nose loudly again. “I shall not forget you,” he said, speaking trifle huskily, Dick spoken; “nor do not go forget get among British arrystocracy.” “I should not forget you, whoever I among,” answered his lordship. “I have spent happiest hours you; least, happiest hours. I hope you will come see sometime. I am sure grandpapa would much pleased. Perhaps he will write ask you, I tell you. You--you would not mind his earl, would you, I mean would not stay away he one, he invited come?” “I would come see you,” replied Mr. Hobbs, graciously. So seemed agreed he received pressing invitation Earl come spend months Dorincourt Castle, he lay aside his republican prejudices pack his valise once. At last preparations complete; day came trunks taken steamer, hour arrived carriage stood door. Then curious feeling loneliness came upon little boy. His mamma shut her room time; she came stairs, her eyes looked large wet, her sweet mouth trembling. Cedric went her, she bent him, he put his arms around her, kissed other. He knew something made sorry, though he scarcely knew was; one tender little thought rose his lips. “We liked little house, Dearest, did not we?” he said. “We always like it, will not we?” “Yes--yes,” she answered, low, sweet voice. “Yes, darling.” And went carriage Cedric sat close her, she looked back window, he looked her stroked her hand held close. And then, seemed almost directly, steamer midst wildest bustle confusion; carriages driving leaving passengers; passengers getting state excitement baggage arrived threatened late; big trunks cases bumped dragged about; sailors uncoiling ropes hurrying fro; officers giving orders; ladies gentlemen children nurses coming board,--some laughing looked gay, silent sad, two three crying touching eyes handkerchiefs. Cedric found something interest every side; he looked piles rope, furled sails, tall, tall masts seemed almost touch hot blue sky; he began make plans conversing sailors gaining information subject pirates. It last, he standing leaning railing upper deck watching final preparations, enjoying excitement shouts sailors wharfmen, his attention called slight bustle one groups far him. Some one hurriedly forcing his way group coming toward him. It boy, something red his hand. It Dick. He came Cedric quite breathless. “I have run way,” he said. “I have come see ye off. Trade's prime! I bought ye I made yesterday. Ye kin wear ye get among swells. I lost paper I tryin' get fellers downstairs. They did not want let up. It is hankercher.” He poured forth one sentence. A bell rang, he made leap away Cedric time speak. “Good-bye!” he panted. “Wear ye get among swells.” And he darted gone. A seconds later saw struggle crowd lower deck, rush shore gang-plank drawn in. He stood wharf waved his cap. Cedric held handkerchief his hand. It bright red silk ornamented purple horseshoes horses' heads. There great straining creaking confusion. The people wharf began shout friends, people steamer shouted back: “Good-bye! Good-bye! Good-bye, old fellow!” Every one seemed saying, “Do not forget us. Write get Liverpool. Good-bye! Good-bye!” Little Lord Fauntleroy leaned forward waved red handkerchief. “Good-bye, Dick!” he shouted, lustily. “Thank you! Good-bye, Dick!” And big steamer moved away, people cheered again, Cedric's mother drew veil her eyes, shore left great confusion; Dick saw nothing save bright, childish face bright hair sun shone breeze lifted, he heard nothing hearty childish voice calling “Good-bye, Dick!” little Lord Fauntleroy steamed slowly away home his birth unknown land his ancestors. IV It voyage Cedric's mother told his home hers; he first understood it, his grief great Mr. Havisham saw Earl wise making arrangements his mother quite near him, see often; plain he could borne separation otherwise. But his mother managed little fellow sweetly lovingly, made feel she would near him, that, while, he ceased oppressed fear real parting. “My house far Castle, Ceddie,” she repeated time subject referred to--“a little way yours, always run see every day, many things tell me! shall happy together! It beautiful place. Your papa often told it. He loved much; love too.” “I love better there,” his small lordship said, heavy little sigh. He could feel puzzled strange state affairs, could put his “Dearest” one house another. The fact Mrs. Errol thought better tell plan made. “I prefer he told,” she said Mr. Havisham. “He would really understand; he would shocked hurt; I feel sure his feeling Earl natural affectionate one he know his grandfather dislikes bitterly. He never seen hatred hardness, would great blow find one could hate me. He loving himself, I dear him! It better he told he much older, far better Earl. It would make barrier them, even though Ceddie child.” So Cedric knew mysterious reason arrangement, reason he old enough understand, would explained he older. He puzzled; but, all, reason he cared much; many talks his mother, she comforted placed bright side picture, dark side gradually began fade out, though Mr. Havisham saw sitting queer little old-fashioned attitude, watching sea, grave face, he heard unchildish sigh rise his lips. “I do not like it,” he said he one his almost venerable talks lawyer. “You do not know much I do not like it; great many troubles world, bear them. Mary says so, I have heard Mr. Hobbs say too. And Dearest wants like live grandpapa, because, see, his children dead, that is mournful. It makes sorry man, his children died--and one killed suddenly.” One things always delighted people made acquaintance his young lordship sage little air he wore times he gave conversation;--combined his occasionally elderly remarks extreme innocence seriousness his round childish face, irresistible. He handsome, blooming, curly-headed little fellow, that, he sat nursed his knee his chubby hands, conversed much gravity, he source great entertainment his hearers. Gradually Mr. Havisham begun derive great deal private pleasure amusement his society. “And going try like Earl,” he said. “Yes,” answered his lordship. “He is relation, course like relations; besides, he is kind me. When person many things you, wants everything wish for, course you would like he was not relation; he is relation that, why, you are fond him.” “Do think,” suggested Mr. Havisham, “that he fond you?” “Well,” said Cedric, “I think he will, because, see, I am his relation, too, I am his boy's little boy besides, and, well, do not see--of course he must fond now, he would not want everything I like, he would not sent me.” “Oh!” remarked lawyer, “that is it, it?” “Yes,” said Cedric, “that is it. Do not think that is it, too? Of course man would fond his grandson.” The people seasick sooner recovered seasickness, come deck recline steamer-chairs enjoy themselves, every one seemed know romantic story little Lord Fauntleroy, every one took interest little fellow, ran ship walked his mother tall, thin old lawyer, talked sailors. Every one liked him; he made friends everywhere. He ever ready make friends. When gentlemen walked deck, let walk them, he stepped manly, sturdy little tramp, answered jokes much gay enjoyment; ladies talked him, always laughter group he center; he played children, always magnificent fun hand. Among sailors he heartiest friends; he heard miraculous stories pirates shipwrecks desert islands; he learned splice ropes rig toy ships, gained amount information concerning “tops'ls” “mains'ls,” quite surprising. His conversation had, indeed, quite nautical flavor times, one occasion he raised shout laughter group ladies gentlemen sitting deck, wrapped shawls overcoats, saying sweetly, engaging expression: “Shiver timbers, it is cold day!” It surprised laughed. He picked sea-faring remark “elderly naval man” name Jerry, told stories occurred frequently. To judge his stories his adventures, Jerry made two three thousand voyages, invariably shipwrecked occasion island densely populated bloodthirsty cannibals. Judging, also, exciting adventures, he partially roasted eaten frequently scalped fifteen twenty times. “That he bald,” explained Lord Fauntleroy his mamma. “After scalped several times hair never grows again. Jerry's never grew last time, King Parromachaweekins knife made skull Chief Wopslemumpkies. He says one serious times he ever had. He frightened his hair stood right straight king flourished his knife, never would lie down, king wears way now, looks something like hair-brush. I never heard anything like asperiences Jerry had! I like tell Mr. Hobbs them!” Sometimes, weather disagreeable people kept decks saloon, party his grown-up friends would persuade tell “asperiences” Jerry's, he sat relating great delight fervor, certainly popular voyager ocean steamer crossing Atlantic little Lord Fauntleroy. He always innocently good-naturedly ready his small best add general entertainment, charm unconsciousness his childish importance. “Jerry's stories int'rust much,” he said his mamma. “For part--you must excuse me, Dearest--but sometimes I thought could not quite true, had not happened Jerry himself; happened Jerry--well, it is strange, know, perhaps sometimes he may forget little mistaken, he is scalped often. Being scalped great many times might make person forgetful.” It eleven days he said good-bye his friend Dick he reached Liverpool; night twelfth day carriage he his mother Mr. Havisham driven station stopped gates Court Lodge. They could see much house darkness. Cedric saw drive-way great arching trees, carriage rolled drive-way short distance, he saw open door stream bright light coming it. Mary come attend her mistress, she reached house them. When Cedric jumped carriage he saw one two servants standing wide, bright hall, Mary stood door-way. Lord Fauntleroy sprang her gay little shout. “Did get here, Mary?” he said. “Here is Mary, Dearest,” he kissed maid her rough red cheek. “I glad here, Mary,” Mrs. Errol said her low voice. “It comfort see you. It takes strangeness away.” And she held her little hand, Mary squeezed encouragingly. She knew first “strangeness” must feel little mother left her land give her child. The English servants looked curiosity boy his mother. They heard sorts rumors both; knew angry old Earl been, Mrs. Errol live lodge her little boy castle; knew great fortune he inherit, savage old grandfather his gout his tempers. “He will easy time it, poor little chap,” said among themselves. But know sort little lord come among them; quite understand character next Earl Dorincourt. He pulled his overcoat quite he used things himself, began look him. He looked broad hall, pictures stags' antlers curious things ornamented it. They seemed curious he never seen things private house. “Dearest,” he said, “this pretty house, is not it? I glad going live here. It is quite large house.” It quite large house compared one shabby New York street, pretty cheerful. Mary led upstairs bright chintz-hung bedroom fire burning, large snow-white Persian cat sleeping luxuriously white fur hearth-rug. “It house-kaper Castle, madam, sint her yez,” explained Mary. “It is herself kind-hearted lady an' iverything done prepar' fur yez. I seen her meself minnits, an' she fond av Capt'in, madam, an' graivs fur him; she said say big cat slapin' rug moight make room homeloike yez. She knowed Capt'in Errol whin he bye--an' foine handsum' bye she ses he was, an' foine young man wid plisint word fur every one, great an' shmall. An' ses I her, ses I: 'He is lift bye that is loike him, madam, fur foiner little felly niver sthipped shoe-leather.”' When ready, went downstairs another big bright room; ceiling low, furniture heavy beautifully carved, chairs deep high massive backs, queer shelves cabinets strange, pretty ornaments them. There great tiger-skin fire, arm-chair side it. The stately white cat responded Lord Fauntleroy's stroking followed downstairs, he threw upon rug, she curled herself grandly beside she intended make friends. Cedric pleased he put his head hers, lay stroking her, noticing his mother Mr. Havisham saying. They were, indeed, speaking rather low tone. Mrs. Errol looked little pale agitated. “He need go to-night?” she said. “He stay to-night?” “Yes,” answered Mr. Havisham low tone; “it necessary go to-night. I go Castle soon dined, inform Earl arrival.” Mrs. Errol glanced Cedric. He lying graceful, careless attitude upon black-and-yellow skin; fire shone his handsome, flushed little face, tumbled, curly hair spread rug; big cat purring drowsy content,--she liked caressing touch kind little hand her fur. Mrs. Errol smiled faintly. “His lordship know he taking me,” she said rather sadly. Then she looked lawyer. “Will tell him, please,” she said, “that I rather money?” “The money!” Mr. Havisham exclaimed. “You mean income he proposed settle upon you!” “Yes,” she answered, quite simply; “I think I rather it. I obliged accept house, I thank it, makes possible near child; I little money own,--enough live simply upon,--and I rather take other. As he dislikes much, I feel little I selling Cedric him. I giving I love enough forget his good, his father would wish so.” Mr. Havisham rubbed his chin. “This strange,” he said. “He angry. He will not understand it.” “I think he understand he thinks over,” she said. “I really need money, I accept luxuries man hates much he takes little boy me--his son's child?” Mr. Havisham looked reflective moments. “I deliver message,” he said afterward. And dinner brought sat together, big cat taking seat chair near Cedric's purring majestically throughout meal. When, later evening, Mr. Havisham presented Castle, he taken Earl. He found sitting fire luxurious easy-chair, his foot gout-stool. He looked lawyer sharply his shaggy eyebrows, Mr. Havisham could see that, spite his pretense calmness, he nervous secretly excited. “Well,” he said; “well, Havisham, come back, you? What is news?” “Lord Fauntleroy his mother Court Lodge,” replied Mr. Havisham. “They bore voyage well excellent health.” The Earl made half-impatient sound moved his hand restlessly. “Glad hear it,” he said brusquely. “So far, good. Make comfortable. Have glass wine settle down. What else?” “His lordship remains his mother to-night. To-morrow I bring Castle.” The Earl's elbow resting arm his chair; he put his hand shielded his eyes it. “Well,” he said; “go on. You know I told write matter, I know nothing whatever it. What kind lad he? I do not care mother; sort lad he?” Mr. Havisham drank little glass port he poured himself, sat holding his hand. “It rather difficult judge character child seven,” he said cautiously. The Earl's prejudices intense. He looked quickly uttered rough word. “A fool, he?” he exclaimed. “Or clumsy cub? His American blood tells, it?” “I think injured him, lord,” replied lawyer his dry, deliberate fashion. “I do not know much children, I thought rather fine lad.” His manner speech always deliberate unenthusiastic, he made trifle usual. He shrewd fancy would better Earl judge himself, quite unprepared his first interview his grandson. “Healthy well-grown?” asked lord. “Apparently healthy, quite well-grown,” replied lawyer. “Straight-limbed well enough look at?” demanded Earl. A slight smile touched Mr. Havisham's thin lips. There rose his mind's eye picture he left Court Lodge,--the beautiful, graceful child's body lying upon tiger-skin careless comfort--the bright, tumbled hair spread rug--the bright, rosy boy's face. “Rather handsome boy, I think, lord, boys go,” he said, “though I scarcely judge, perhaps. But find somewhat different English children, I dare say.” “I have not doubt that,” snarled Earl, twinge gout seizing him. “A lot impudent little beggars, American children; I have heard often enough.” “It exactly impudence his case,” said Mr. Havisham. “I scarcely describe difference is. He lived older people children, difference seems mixture maturity childishness.” “American impudence!” protested Earl. “I have heard before. They call precocity freedom. Beastly, impudent bad manners; that is is!” Mr. Havisham drank port. He seldom argued his lordly patron,--never his lordly patron's noble leg inflamed gout. At times always better leave alone. So silence moments. It Mr. Havisham broke it. “I message deliver Mrs. Errol,” he remarked. “I do not want her messages!” growled his lordship; “the less I hear her better.” “This rather important one,” explained lawyer. “She prefers accept income proposed settle her.” The Earl started visibly. “What is that?” he cried out. “What is that?” Mr. Havisham repeated his words. “She says necessary, relations friendly----” “Not friendly!” ejaculated lord savagely; “I say friendly! I hate think her! A mercenary, sharp-voiced American! I do not wish see her.” “My lord,” said Mr. Havisham, “you scarcely call her mercenary. She asked nothing. She accept money offer her.” “All done effect!” snapped his noble lordship. “She wants wheedle seeing her. She thinks I shall admire her spirit. I do not admire it! It is American independence! I will not her living like beggar park gates. As she is boy's mother, she position keep up, she shall keep up. She shall money, whether she likes not!” “She will not spend it,” said Mr. Havisham. “I do not care whether she spends not!” blustered lord. “She shall sent her. She shall not tell people she live like pauper I done nothing her! She wants give boy bad opinion me! I suppose she poisoned his mind already!” “No,” said Mr. Havisham. “I another message, prove she done that.” “I do not want hear it!” panted Earl, breath anger excitement gout. But Mr. Havisham delivered it. “She asks let Lord Fauntleroy hear anything would lead understand separate her prejudice her. He fond her, she convinced would barrier exist you. She says he would comprehend it, might make fear measure, least feel less affection you. She told he young understand reason, shall hear he older. She wishes shadow first meeting.” The Earl sank back his chair. His deep-set fierce old eyes gleamed his beetling brows. “Come, now!” he said, still breathlessly. “Come, now! You do not mean mother has not told him?” “Not one word, lord,” replied lawyer coolly. “That I assure you. The child prepared believe amiable affectionate grandparents. Nothing--absolutely nothing said give slightest doubt perfection. And I carried commands every detail, New York, he certainly regards wonder generosity.” “He does, eh?” said Earl. “I give word honor,” said Mr. Havisham, “that Lord Fauntleroy's impressions depend entirely upon yourself. And pardon liberty I take making suggestion, I think succeed better take precaution speak slightingly his mother.” “Pooh, pooh!” said Earl. “The youngster seven years old!” “He spent seven years his mother's side,” returned Mr. Havisham; “and she his affection.” V It late afternoon carriage containing little Lord Fauntleroy Mr. Havisham drove long avenue led castle. The Earl given orders his grandson arrive time dine him; reason best known himself, he also ordered child sent alone room he intended receive him. As carriage rolled avenue, Lord Fauntleroy sat leaning comfortably luxurious cushions, regarded prospect great interest. He was, fact, interested everything he saw. He interested carriage, large, splendid horses glittering harness; he interested tall coachman footman, resplendent livery; he especially interested coronet panels, struck acquaintance footman purpose inquiring meant. When carriage reached great gates park, he looked window get good view huge stone lions ornamenting entrance. The gates opened motherly, rosy-looking woman, came pretty, ivy-covered lodge. Two children ran door house stood looking round, wide-open eyes little boy carriage, looked also. Their mother stood courtesying smiling, children, receiving sign her, made bobbing little courtesies too. “Does she know me?” asked Lord Fauntleroy. “I think she must think she knows me.” And he took his black velvet cap her smiled. “How do?” he said brightly. “Good-afternoon!” The woman seemed pleased, he thought. The smile broadened her rosy face kind look came her blue eyes. “God bless lordship!” she said. “God bless pretty face! Good luck happiness lordship! Welcome you!” Lord Fauntleroy waved his cap nodded her carriage rolled her. “I like woman,” he said. “She looks she liked boys. I like come play her children. I wonder she enough make company?” Mr. Havisham tell he would scarcely allowed make playmates gate-keeper's children. The lawyer thought time enough giving information. The carriage rolled great, beautiful trees grew side avenue stretched broad, swaying branches arch across it. Cedric never seen trees,--they grand stately, branches grew low huge trunks. He know Dorincourt Castle one beautiful England; park one broadest finest, trees avenue almost without rivals. But he know beautiful. He liked big, broad-branched trees, late afternoon sunlight striking golden lances them. He liked perfect stillness rested everything. He felt great, strange pleasure beauty he caught glimpses sweeping boughs--the great, beautiful spaces park, still trees standing sometimes stately alone, sometimes groups. Now passed places tall ferns grew masses, ground azure bluebells swaying soft breeze. Several times he started laugh delight rabbit leaped greenery scudded away twinkle short white tail behind it. Once covey partridges rose sudden whir flew away, he shouted clapped his hands. “It is beautiful place, is not it?” he said Mr. Havisham. “I never saw beautiful place. It is prettier even Central Park.” He rather puzzled length time way. “How far it,” he said, length, “from gate front door?” “It three four miles,” answered lawyer. “That is long way person live his gate,” remarked his lordship. Every minutes he saw something new wonder admire. When he caught sight deer, couched grass, standing pretty antlered heads turned half-startled air toward avenue carriage wheels disturbed them, he enchanted. “Has circus?” he cried; “or live always? Whose they?” “They live here,” Mr. Havisham told him. “They belong Earl, grandfather.” It long saw castle. It rose stately beautiful gray, last rays sun casting dazzling lights many windows. It turrets battlements towers; great deal ivy grew upon walls; broad, open space laid terraces lawns beds brilliant flowers. “It is beautiful place I ever saw!” said Cedric, his round face flushing pleasure. “It reminds one king's palace. I saw picture one fairy-book.” He saw great entrance-door thrown open many servants standing two lines looking him. He wondered standing there, admired liveries much. He know honor little boy splendor would one day belong,--the beautiful castle like fairy king's palace, magnificent park, grand old trees, dells full ferns bluebells hares rabbits played, dappled, large-eyed deer couching deep grass. It couple weeks since he sat Mr. Hobbs among potatoes canned peaches, his legs dangling high stool; would possible realize he much grandeur. At head line servants stood elderly woman rich, plain black silk gown; she gray hair wore cap. As he entered hall she stood nearer rest, child thought look her eyes she going speak him. Mr. Havisham, held his hand, paused moment. “This Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon,” he said. “Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon, housekeeper.” Cedric gave her his hand, his eyes lighting up. “Was sent cat?” he said. “I am much obliged you, madam.” Mrs. Mellon's handsome old face looked pleased face lodge-keeper's wife done. “I know his lordship anywhere,” she said Mr. Havisham. “He Captain's face way. It is great day, this, sir.” Cedric wondered great day. He looked Mrs. Mellon curiously. It seemed moment tears her eyes, yet evident she unhappy. She smiled him. “The cat left two beautiful kittens here,” she said; “they shall sent lordship's nursery.” Mr. Havisham said words her low voice. “In library, sir,” Mrs. Mellon replied. “His lordship taken alone.” A minutes later, tall footman livery, escorted Cedric library door, opened announced: “Lord Fauntleroy, lord,” quite majestic tone. If he footman, he felt rather grand occasion heir came home his land possessions, ushered presence old Earl, whose place title he take. Cedric crossed threshold room. It large splendid room, massive carven furniture it, shelves upon shelves books; furniture dark, draperies heavy, diamond-paned windows deep, seemed distance one end other, that, since sun gone down, effect rather gloomy. For moment Cedric thought nobody room, soon he saw fire burning wide hearth large easy-chair chair one sitting--some one first turn look him. But he attracted attention one quarter least. On floor, arm-chair, lay dog, huge tawny mastiff, body limbs almost big lion's; great creature rose majestically slowly, marched toward little fellow heavy step. Then person chair spoke. “Dougal,” he called, “come back, sir.” But fear little Lord Fauntleroy's heart unkindness--he brave little fellow his life. He put his hand big dog's collar natural way world, strayed forward together, Dougal sniffing he went. And Earl looked up. What Cedric saw large old man shaggy white hair eyebrows, nose like eagle's beak his deep, fierce eyes. What Earl saw graceful, childish figure black velvet suit, lace collar, love-locks waving handsome, manly little face, whose eyes met his look innocent good-fellowship. If Castle like palace fairy story, must owned little Lord Fauntleroy rather like small copy fairy prince, though he aware fact, perhaps rather sturdy young model fairy. But sudden glow triumph exultation fiery old Earl's heart he saw strong, beautiful boy grandson was, unhesitatingly he looked he stood his hand big dog's neck. It pleased grim old nobleman child show shyness fear, either dog himself. Cedric looked he looked woman lodge housekeeper, came quite close him. “Are Earl?” he said. “I am grandson, know, Mr. Havisham brought. I am Lord Fauntleroy.” He held his hand he thought must polite proper thing even earls. “I hope well,” he continued, utmost friendliness. “I am glad see you.” The Earl shook hands him, curious gleam his eyes; first, he astonished he scarcely knew say. He stared picturesque little apparition his shaggy brows, took head foot. “Glad see me, you?” he said. “Yes,” answered Lord Fauntleroy, “very.” There chair near him, he sat it; high-backed, rather tall chair, his feet touch floor he settled it, he seemed quite comfortable he sat there, regarded his august relative intently modestly. “I have kept wondering would look like,” he remarked. “I used lie berth ship wonder would anything like father.” “Am I?” asked Earl. “Well,” Cedric replied, “I young he died, I may remember exactly he looked, I do not think like him.” “You disappointed, I suppose?” suggested his grandfather. “Oh, no,” responded Cedric politely. “Of course would like one look like father; course would enjoy way grandfather looked, even he was not like father. You know admiring relations.” The Earl leaned back his chair stared. He could said know admiring his relations. He employed his noble leisure quarreling violently them, turning his house, applying abusive epithets them; hated cordially. “Any boy would love his grandfather,” continued Lord Fauntleroy, “especially one kind been.” Another queer gleam came old nobleman's eyes. “Oh!” he said, “I kind you, I?” “Yes,” answered Lord Fauntleroy brightly; “I am ever much obliged Bridget, apple-woman, Dick.” “Bridget!” exclaimed Earl. “Dick! The apple-woman!” “Yes!” explained Cedric; “the ones gave money for--the money told Mr. Havisham give I wanted it.” “Ha!” ejaculated his lordship. “That is it, it? The money spend liked. What buy it? I like hear something that.” He drew his shaggy eyebrows together looked child sharply. He secretly curious know way lad indulged himself. “Oh!” said Lord Fauntleroy, “perhaps did not know Dick apple-woman Bridget. I forgot lived long way them. They particular friends mine. And see Michael fever----” “Who is Michael?” asked Earl. “Michael Bridget's husband, great trouble. When man sick cannot work twelve children, know is. And Michael always sober man. And Bridget used come house cry. And evening Mr. Havisham there, she kitchen crying, almost nothing eat could not pay rent; I went see her, Mr. Havisham sent he said given money me. And I ran fast I could kitchen gave Bridget; made right; Bridget could scarcely believe her eyes. That is I am obliged you.” “Oh!” said Earl his deep voice, “that one things yourself, it? What else?” Dougal sitting tall chair; great dog taken place Cedric sat down. Several times turned looked boy interested conversation. Dougal solemn dog, seemed feel altogether big take life's responsibilities lightly. The old Earl, knew dog well, watched secret interest. Dougal dog whose habit make acquaintances rashly, Earl wondered somewhat see quietly brute sat touch childish hand. And, moment, big dog gave little Lord Fauntleroy one look dignified scrutiny, deliberately laid huge, lion-like head boy's black-velvet knee. The small hand went stroking new friend Cedric answered: “Well, Dick,” he said. “You would like Dick, he is square.” This Americanism Earl prepared for. “What mean?” he inquired. Lord Fauntleroy paused moment reflect. He sure meant. He taken granted meaning something creditable Dick fond using it. “I think means he would not cheat one,” he exclaimed; “or hit boy his size, he blacks people's boots well makes shine much he can. He is perfessional bootblack.” “And he is one acquaintances, he?” said Earl. “He old friend mine,” replied his grandson. “Not quite old Mr. Hobbs, quite old. He gave present ship sailed.” He put his hand his pocket drew forth neatly folded red object opened air affectionate pride. It red silk handkerchief large purple horse-shoes heads it. “He gave this,” said his young lordship. “I shall keep always. You wear round neck keep pocket. He bought first money he earned I bought Jake gave new brushes. It is keepsake. I put poetry Mr. Hobbs's watch. It was, 'When see, remember me.' When I see, I shall always remember Dick.” The sensations Right Honorable Earl Dorincourt could scarcely described. He old nobleman easily bewildered, he seen great deal world; something he found novel almost took his lordly breath away, caused singular emotions. He never cared children; he occupied his pleasures he never time care them. His sons interested young--though sometimes he remembered thought Cedric's father handsome strong little fellow. He selfish he missed pleasure seeing unselfishness others, he known tender faithful affectionate kind-hearted little child be, innocent unconscious simple, generous impulses. A boy always seemed objectionable little animal, selfish greedy boisterous strict restraint; his two eldest sons given tutors constant trouble annoyance, younger one he fancied he heard complaints boy particular importance. It never occurred he like his grandson; he sent little Cedric his pride impelled so. If boy take his place future, he wish his name made ridiculous descending uneducated boor. He convinced boy would clownish fellow he brought America. He feeling affection lad; his hope he find decently well-featured, respectable share sense; he disappointed his sons, made furious Captain Errol's American marriage, he never thought anything creditable could come it. When footman announced Lord Fauntleroy, he almost dreaded look boy lest he find he feared. It feeling he ordered child sent alone. His pride could endure others see his disappointment he disappointed. His proud, stubborn old heart therefore leaped within boy came forward his graceful, easy carriage, his fearless hand big dog's neck. Even moments he hoped most, Earl never hoped his grandson would look like that. It seemed almost good true boy he dreaded see--the child woman he disliked--this little fellow much beauty brave, childish grace! The Earl's stern composure quite shaken startling surprise. And talk began; he still curiously moved, puzzled. In first place, he used seeing people rather afraid embarrassed him, he expected nothing else his grandson would timid shy. But Cedric afraid Earl he Dougal. He bold; he innocently friendly, he conscious could reason he awkward afraid. The Earl could help seeing little boy took friend treated one, without doubt all. It quite plain little fellow sat his tall chair talked his friendly way never occurred large, fierce-looking old man could anything kind him, rather pleased see there. And plain, too, that, his childish way, he wished please interest his grandfather. Cross, hard-hearted, worldly old Earl was, he could help feeling secret novel pleasure confidence. After all, disagreeable meet one distrust shrink him, seem detect ugly part his nature; one looked clear, unsuspecting eyes,--if little boy black velvet suit. So old man leaned back his chair, led his young companion telling still himself, odd gleam his eyes watched little fellow he talked. Lord Fauntleroy quite willing answer his questions chatted his genial little way quite composedly. He told Dick Jake, apple-woman, Mr. Hobbs; he described Republican Rally glory banners transparencies, torches rockets. In course conversation, he reached Fourth July Revolution, becoming enthusiastic, he suddenly recollected something stopped abruptly. “What matter?” demanded his grandfather. “Why do not go on?” Lord Fauntleroy moved rather uneasily his chair. It evident Earl he embarrassed thought occurred him. “I thinking perhaps might not like it,” he replied. “Perhaps one belonging might there. I forgot Englishman.” “You go on,” said lord. “No one belonging there. You forgot Englishman, too.” “Oh! no,” said Cedric quickly. “I am American!” “You Englishman,” said Earl grimly. “Your father Englishman.” It amused little say this, amuse Cedric. The lad never thought development this. He felt grow quite hot roots his hair. “I born America,” he protested. “You American born America. I beg pardon,” serious politeness delicacy, “for contradicting you. Mr. Hobbs told me, another war, know, I to--to American.” The Earl gave grim half laugh--it short grim, laugh. “You would, would you?” he said. He hated America Americans, amused see serious interested small patriot was. He thought good American might make rather good Englishman he man. They time go deep Revolution again--and indeed Lord Fauntleroy felt delicacy returning subject--before dinner announced. Cedric left his chair went his noble kinsman. He looked his gouty foot. “Would like help you?” he said politely. “You could lean me, know. Once Mr. Hobbs hurt his foot potato-barrel rolling it, he used lean me.” The big footman almost periled his reputation his situation smiling. He aristocratic footman always lived best noble families, he never smiled; indeed, he would felt disgraced vulgar footman he allowed led circumstance whatever indiscretion smile. But he narrow escape. He saved staring straight Earl's head ugly picture. The Earl looked his valiant young relative head foot. “Do think could it?” he asked gruffly. “I THINK I could,” said Cedric. “I am strong. I am seven, know. You could lean stick one side, other. Dick says I have good deal muscle boy that is seven.” He shut his hand moved upward his shoulder, Earl might see muscle Dick kindly approved of, his face grave earnest footman found necessary look hard indeed ugly picture. “Well,” said Earl, “you may try.” Cedric gave his stick began assist rise. Usually, footman this, violently sworn his lordship extra twinge gout. The Earl polite person rule, many time huge footmen quaked inside imposing liveries. But evening he swear, though his gouty foot gave twinges one. He chose try experiment. He got slowly put his hand small shoulder presented much courage. Little Lord Fauntleroy made careful step forward, looking gouty foot. “Just lean me,” he said, encouraging good cheer. “I will walk slowly.” If Earl supported footman he would rested less his stick his assistant's arm. And yet part his experiment let his grandson feel his burden light weight. It quite heavy weight indeed, steps his young lordship's face grew quite hot, his heart beat rather fast, he braced sturdily, remembering his muscle Dick's approval it. “Do not afraid leaning me,” he panted. “I am right--if--if is not long way.” It really far dining-room, seemed rather long way Cedric, reached chair head table. The hand his shoulder seemed grow heavier every step, his face grew redder hotter, his breath shorter, he never thought giving up; he stiffened his childish muscles, held his head erect, encouraged Earl he limped along. “Does foot hurt much stand it?” he asked. “Did ever put hot water mustard? Mr. Hobbs used put his hot water. Arnica nice thing, tell me.” The big dog stalked slowly beside them, big footman followed; several times he looked queer he watched little figure making strength, bearing burden good-will. The Earl, too, looked rather queer, once, he glanced sidewise flushed little face. When entered room dine, Cedric saw large imposing one, footman stood behind chair head table stared hard came in. But reached chair last. The hand removed his shoulder, Earl fairly seated. Cedric took Dick's handkerchief wiped his forehead. “It is warm night, is not it?” he said. “Perhaps need fire because--because foot, seems little warm me.” His delicate consideration his noble relative's feelings he wish seem intimate his surroundings unnecessary. “You rather hard work,” said Earl. “Oh, no!” said Lord Fauntleroy, “it was not exactly hard, I got little warm. A person get warm summer time.” And he rubbed his damp curls rather vigorously gorgeous handkerchief. His chair placed end table, opposite his grandfather's. It chair arms, intended much larger individual himself; indeed, everything he seen far,--the great rooms, high ceilings, massive furniture, big footman, big dog, Earl himself,--were proportions calculated make little lad feel he small, indeed. But trouble him; he never thought large important, he quite willing accommodate even circumstances rather overpowered him. Perhaps he never looked little fellow seated his great chair, end table. Notwithstanding his solitary existence, Earl chose live state. He fond his dinner, he dined formal style. Cedric looked across glitter splendid glass plate, his unaccustomed eyes seemed quite dazzling. A stranger looking might well smiled picture,--the great stately room, big liveried servants, bright lights, glittering silver glass, fierce-looking old nobleman head table small boy foot. Dinner usually serious matter Earl--and serious matter cook, his lordship pleased indifferent appetite. To-day, however, his appetite seemed trifle better usual, perhaps he something think beside flavor entrees management gravies. His grandson gave something think of. He kept looking across table. He say much himself, he managed make boy talk. He never imagined he could entertained hearing child talk, Lord Fauntleroy puzzled amused him, he kept remembering he let childish shoulder feel his weight sake trying far boy's courage endurance would go, pleased know his grandson quailed seemed think even moment giving he undertaken do. “You do not wear coronet time?” remarked Lord Fauntleroy respectfully. “No,” replied Earl, his grim smile; “it becoming me.” “Mr. Hobbs said always wore it,” said Cedric; “but he thought over, he said he supposed must sometimes take put hat on.” “Yes,” said Earl, “I take occasionally.” And one footmen suddenly turned aside gave singular little cough behind his hand. Cedric finished his dinner first, he leaned back his chair took survey room. “You must proud house,” he said, “it is beautiful house. I never saw anything beautiful; but, course, I am seven, I have not seen much.” “And think I must proud it, you?” said Earl. “I think one would proud it,” replied Lord Fauntleroy. “I proud house. Everything beautiful. And park, trees,--how beautiful are, leaves rustle!” Then he paused instant looked across table rather wistfully. “It is big house two people live in, is not it?” he said. “It quite large enough two,” answered Earl. “Do find large?” His little lordship hesitated moment. “I thinking,” he said, “that two people lived good companions, might feel lonely sometimes.” “Do think I shall make good companion?” inquired Earl. “Yes,” replied Cedric, “I think will. Mr. Hobbs I great friends. He best friend I except Dearest.” The Earl made quick movement his bushy eyebrows. “Who Dearest?” “She mother,” said Lord Fauntleroy, rather low, quiet little voice. Perhaps he trifle tired, his bed-time nearing, perhaps excitement last days natural he tired, perhaps, too, feeling weariness brought vague sense loneliness remembrance to-night he sleep home, watched loving eyes “best friend” his. They always “best friends,” boy his young mother. He could help thinking her, he thought her less he inclined talk, time dinner end Earl saw faint shadow his face. But Cedric bore excellent courage, went back library, though tall footman walked one side his master, Earl's hand rested his grandson's shoulder, though heavily before. When footman left alone, Cedric sat upon hearth-rug near Dougal. For minutes he stroked dog's ears silence looked fire. The Earl watched him. The boy's eyes looked wistful thoughtful, twice he gave little sigh. The Earl sat still, kept his eyes fixed his grandson. “Fauntleroy,” he said last, “what thinking of?” Fauntleroy looked manful effort smile. “I thinking Dearest,” he said; “and--and I think I would better get walk room.” He rose up, put his hands his small pockets, began walk fro. His eyes bright, his lips pressed together, he kept his head walked firmly. Dougal moved lazily looked him, stood up. He walked child, began follow uneasily. Fauntleroy drew one hand his pocket laid dog's head. “He is nice dog,” he said. “He is friend. He knows I feel.” “How feel?” asked Earl. It disturbed see struggle little fellow his first feeling homesickness, pleased see he making brave effort bear well. He liked childish courage. “Come here,” he said. Fauntleroy went him. “I never away house before,” said boy, troubled look his brown eyes. “It makes person feel strange feeling he stay night another person's castle instead his house. But Dearest far away me. She told remember that--and--and I am seven--and I look picture she gave me.” He put his hand his pocket, brought small violet velvet-covered case. “This it,” he said. “You see, press spring opens, she there!” He come close Earl's chair, and, he drew forth little case, he leaned arm it, old man's arm, too, confidingly children always leaned there. “There she is,” he said, case opened; he looked smile. The Earl knitted his brows; he wish see picture, he looked spite himself; looked pretty young face--a face like child's his side--that quite startled him. “I suppose think fond her,” he said. “Yes,” answered Lord Fauntleroy, gentle tone, simple directness; “I think so, I think it is true. You see, Mr. Hobbs friend, Dick Bridget Mary Michael, friends, too; Dearest--well, she CLOSE friend, always tell everything. My father left her take care of, I man I going work earn money her.” “What think doing?” inquired his grandfather. His young lordship slipped upon hearth-rug, sat picture still his hand. He seemed reflecting seriously, he answered. “I think perhaps I might go business Mr. Hobbs,” he said; “but I LIKE President.” “We will send House Lords instead,” said his grandfather. “Well,” remarked Lord Fauntleroy, “if I COULD NOT President, good business, I should not mind. The grocery business dull sometimes.” Perhaps he weighing matter his mind, he sat quiet this, looked fire time. The Earl speak again. He leaned back his chair watched him. A great many strange new thoughts passed old nobleman's mind. Dougal stretched gone sleep his head his huge paws. There long silence. In half hour's time Mr. Havisham ushered in. The great room still he entered. The Earl still leaning back his chair. He moved Mr. Havisham approached, held his hand gesture warning--it seemed he scarcely intended make gesture--as almost involuntary. Dougal still asleep, close beside great dog, sleeping also, his curly head upon his arm, lay little Lord Fauntleroy. VI When Lord Fauntleroy wakened morning,--he wakened he carried bed night before,--the first sounds he conscious crackling wood fire murmur voices. “You careful, Dawson, say anything it,” he heard one say. “He know she him, reason kept him.” “If them's his lordship's orders, mem,” another voice answered, “they will kep', I suppose. But, you will excuse liberty, mem, it is ourselves, servant servant, I say is, it is cruel thing,--parting poor, pretty, young widdered cre'tur' her flesh blood, little beauty nobleman born. James Thomas, mem, last night servants' hall,  them say never see anythink two lives--nor yet gentleman livery--like little fellow's ways, innercent an' polite an' interested he would sitting dining his best friend,--and temper a' angel, instead one (if you will excuse me, mem), it is well known, enough curdle blood veins times. And looks, mem, rung for, James me, go library bring upstairs, James lifted his arms, his little innercent face red rosy, his little head James's shoulder his hair hanging down, curly an' shinin', prettier, takiner sight you would never wish see. An' it is opinion, lord was not blind neither, he looked him, he says James, 'See do not wake him!' he says.” Cedric moved his pillow, turned over, opening his eyes. There two women room. Everything bright cheerful gay-flowered chintz. There fire hearth, sunshine streaming ivy-entwined windows. Both women came toward him, he saw one Mrs. Mellon, housekeeper, comfortable, middle-aged woman, face kind good-humored face could be. “Good-morning, lord,” said Mrs. Mellon. “Did sleep well?” His lordship rubbed his eyes smiled. “Good-morning,” he said. “I did not know I here.” “You carried upstairs asleep,” said housekeeper. “This bedroom, Dawson, take care you.” Fauntleroy sat bed held his hand Dawson, he held Earl. “How do, madam?” he said. “I am much obliged coming take care me.” “You call her Dawson, lord,” said housekeeper smile. “She used called Dawson.” “MISS Dawson, MRS. Dawson?” inquired his lordship. “Just Dawson, lord,” said Dawson herself, beaming over. “Neither Miss Missis, bless little heart! Will get now, let Dawson dress you, breakfast nursery?” “I learned dress many years ago, thank you,” answered Fauntleroy. “Dearest taught me. 'Dearest' mamma. We Mary work,--washing all,--and course would not give her much trouble. I take bath, too, pretty well you will kind enough 'zamine corners I am done.” Dawson housekeeper exchanged glances. “Dawson anything ask her to,” said Mrs. Mellon. “That I will, bless him,” said Dawson, her comforting, good-humored voice. “He shall dress he likes, I will stand by, ready help he wants me.” “Thank you,” responded Lord Fauntleroy; “it is little hard sometimes buttons, know, I ask somebody.” He thought Dawson kind woman, bath dressing finished excellent friends, he found great deal her. He discovered her husband soldier killed real battle, her son sailor, away long cruise, he seen pirates cannibals Chinese people Turks, he brought home strange shells pieces coral Dawson ready show moment, her trunk. All interesting. He also found she taken care little children her life, she come great house another part England, she taking care beautiful little girl whose name Lady Gwyneth Vaughn. “And she sort relation lordship's,” said Dawson. “And perhaps sometime may see her.” “Do think I shall?” said Fauntleroy. “I like that. I never knew little girls, I always like look them.” When he went adjoining room take his breakfast, saw great room was, found another adjoining Dawson told his also, feeling he small indeed came strongly he confided Dawson, he sat table pretty breakfast service arranged. “I little boy,” he said rather wistfully, “to live large castle, many big rooms,--do not think so?” “Oh! come!” said Dawson, “you feel little strange first, that is all; you will get soon, you will like here. It is beautiful place, know.” “It is beautiful place, course,” said Fauntleroy, little sigh; “but I like better I did not miss Dearest so. I always breakfast her morning, put sugar cream her tea her, handed her toast. That made sociable, course.” “Oh, well!” answered Dawson, comfortingly, “you know see her every day, there is knowing much you will tell her. Bless you! wait till you have walked bit seen things,--the dogs, stables horses them. There is one I know you will like see----” “Is there?” exclaimed Fauntleroy; “I am fond horses. I fond Jim. He horse belonged Mr. Hobbs' grocery wagon. He beautiful horse he was not balky.” “Well,” said Dawson, “you wait till you have seen what is stables. And, deary me, have not looked even next room yet!” “What there?” asked Fauntleroy. “Wait you have breakfast, shall see,” said Dawson. At he naturally began grow curious, he applied assiduously his breakfast. It seemed must something worth looking at, next room; Dawson consequential, mysterious air. “Now, then,” he said, slipping his seat minutes later; “I have enough. Can I go look it?” Dawson nodded led way, looking mysterious important ever. He began much interested indeed. When she opened door room, he stood upon threshold looked amazement. He speak; he put his hands his pockets stood flushing his forehead looking in. He flushed he surprised and, moment, excited. To see place enough surprise ordinary boy. The room large one, too, rooms seemed be, appeared beautiful rest, different way. The furniture massive antique rooms he seen downstairs; draperies rugs walls brighter; shelves full books, tables numbers toys,--beautiful, ingenious things,--such he looked wonder delight shop windows New York. “It looks like boy's room,” he said last, catching his breath little. “Whom belong to?” “Go look them,” said Dawson. “They belong you!” “To me!” he cried; “to me? Why belong me? Who gave me?” And he sprang forward gay little shout. It seemed almost much believed. “It Grandpapa!” he said, his eyes bright stars. “I know Grandpapa!” “Yes, his lordship,” said Dawson; “and nice little gentleman, fret things, enjoy yourself, happy day, he give anything ask for.” It tremendously exciting morning. There many things examined, many experiments tried; novelty absorbing he could scarcely turn look next. And curious know prepared alone; that, even he left New York, people come London arrange rooms he occupy, provided books playthings likely interest him. “Did ever know one,” he said Dawson, “who kind grandfather!” Dawson's face wore uncertain expression moment. She high opinion his lordship Earl. She house many days, she long enough hear old nobleman's peculiarities discussed freely servants' hall. “An' wicious, savage, hill-tempered hold fellows ever hill-luck wear livery hunder,” tallest footman said, “he is wiolentest wust long shot.” And particular footman, whose name Thomas, also repeated his companions stairs Earl's remarks Mr. Havisham, discussing preparations. “Give his way, fill his rooms toys,” lord said. “Give amuse him, he will forget his mother quickly enough. Amuse him, fill his mind things, shall trouble. That is boy nature.” So, perhaps, truly amiable object view, please much find seem exactly particular boy's nature. The Earl passed bad night spent morning his room; noon, he lunched, he sent his grandson. Fauntleroy answered summons once. He came broad staircase bounding step; Earl heard run across hall, door opened he came red cheeks sparkling eyes. “I waiting send me,” he said. “I ready long time ago. I am EVER much obliged things! I am EVER much obliged you! I playing morning.” “Oh!” said Earl, “you like them, you?” “I like much--well, I could not tell much!” said Fauntleroy, his face glowing delight. “There is one that is like baseball, play board black white pegs, keep score counters wire. I tried teach Dawson, she could not quite understand first--you see, she never played baseball, lady; I am afraid I was not good explaining her. But know it, do not you?” “I am afraid I do not,” replied Earl. “It is American game, is not it? Is something like cricket?” “I never saw cricket,” said Fauntleroy; “but Mr. Hobbs took several times see baseball. It is splendid game. You get excited! Would like go get game show you? Perhaps would amuse make forget foot. Does foot hurt much morning?” “More I enjoy,” answer. “Then perhaps could not forget it,” said little fellow anxiously. “Perhaps would bother told game. Do think would amuse you, think would bother you?” “Go get it,” said Earl. It certainly novel entertainment this,--making companion child offered teach play games,--but novelty amused him. There smile lurking Earl's mouth Cedric came back box containing game, his arms, expression eager interest his face. “May I pull little table chair?” he asked. “Ring Thomas,” said Earl. “He place you.” “Oh, I myself,” answered Fauntleroy. “It is heavy.” “Very well,” replied his grandfather. The lurking smile deepened old man's face he watched little fellow's preparations; absorbed interest them. The small table dragged forward placed his chair, game taken box arranged upon it. “It is interesting begin,” said Fauntleroy. “You see, black pegs side white ones mine. They are men, know, round field home run counts one--and outs--and first base that is second that is third that is home base.” He entered details explanation greatest animation. He showed attitudes pitcher catcher batter real game, gave dramatic description wonderful “hot ball” he seen caught glorious occasion he witnessed match company Mr. Hobbs. His vigorous, graceful little body, his eager gestures, his simple enjoyment all, pleasant behold. When last explanations illustrations end game began good earnest, Earl still found entertained. His young companion wholly absorbed; he played his childish heart; his gay little laughs he made good throw, his enthusiasm “home run,” his impartial delight his good luck his opponent's, would given flavor game. If, week before, one told Earl Dorincourt particular morning he would forgetting his gout his bad temper child's game, played black white wooden pegs, gayly painted board, curly-headed small boy companion, he would without doubt made unpleasant; yet he certainly forgotten door opened Thomas announced visitor. The visitor question, elderly gentleman black, less person clergyman parish, startled amazing scene met his eye, he almost fell back pace, ran risk colliding Thomas. There was, fact, part his duty Reverend Mr. Mordaunt found decidedly unpleasant part compelled call upon his noble patron Castle. His noble patron, indeed, usually made visits disagreeable lay his lordly power make them. He abhorred churches charities, flew violent rages his tenantry took liberty poor ill needing assistance. When his gout worst, he hesitate announce he would bored irritated told stories miserable misfortunes; his gout troubled less he somewhat humane frame mind, he would perhaps give rector money, bullied painful manner, berated whole parish shiftlessness imbecility. But, whatsoever his mood, he never failed make many sarcastic embarrassing speeches possible, Reverend Mr. Mordaunt wish proper Christian-like throw something heavy him. During years Mr. Mordaunt charge Dorincourt parish, rector certainly remember seen his lordship, his free will, one kindness, or, circumstances whatever, show he thought one himself. He called to-day speak specially pressing case, he walked avenue, he had, two reasons, dreaded his visit usual. In first place, he knew his lordship several days suffering gout, villainous humor rumors even reached village--carried one young women servants, her sister, kept little shop retailed darning-needles cotton peppermints gossip, means earning honest living. What Mrs. Dibble know Castle inmates, farm-houses inmates, village population, really worth talked about. And course she knew everything Castle, her sister, Jane Shorts, one upper housemaids, friendly intimate Thomas. “And way his lordship go on!” said Mrs. Dibble, counter, “and way he use language, Mr. Thomas told Jane herself, flesh blood livery could stand--for throw plate toast Mr. Thomas, hisself, he did, two days since, were not things agreeable society stairs genteel, warning would gave within a' hour!” And rector heard this, somehow Earl favorite black sheep cottages farm-houses, his bad behavior gave many good woman something talk she company tea. And second reason even worse, new one talked excited interest. Who know old nobleman's fury his handsome son Captain married American lady? Who know cruelly he treated Captain, big, gay, sweet-smiling young man, member grand family one liked, died foreign land, poor unforgiven? Who know fiercely his lordship hated poor young creature son's wife, he hated thought her child never meant see boy--until his two sons died left without heir? And then, know he looked forward without affection pleasure his grandson's coming, he made his mind he find boy vulgar, awkward, pert American lad, likely disgrace his noble name honor it? The proud, angry old man thought he kept his thoughts secret. He suppose one dared guess at, much less talk he felt, dreaded; his servants watched him, read his face his ill-humors fits gloom, discussed servants' hall. And he thought quite secure common herd, Thomas telling Jane cook, butler, housemaids footmen his opinion “the hold man wuss usual a-thinkin' hover Capting's boy, an' hanticipatin' he will not credit fambly. An' serve right,” added Thomas; “hit's 'is hown fault. Wot he iggspect child brought pore circumstances low Hamerica?” And Reverend Mr. Mordaunt walked great trees, he remembered questionable little boy arrived Castle evening before, nine chances one his lordship's worst fears realized, twenty-two chances one poor little fellow disappointed him, Earl even tearing rage, ready vent his rancor first person called--which appeared probable would his reverend self. Judge his amazement when, Thomas opened library door, his ears greeted delighted ring childish laughter. “That is two out!” shouted excited, clear little voice. “You see it is two out!” And Earl's chair, gout-stool, his foot it; small table game it; quite close him, actually leaning his arm his ungouty knee, little boy face glowing, eyes dancing excitement. “It is two out!” little stranger cried. “You had not luck time, you?”--And recognized one come in. The Earl glanced around, knitting his shaggy eyebrows he trick doing, he saw was, Mr. Mordaunt still surprised see he looked even less disagreeable usual instead so. In fact, he looked almost he forgotten moment disagreeable he was, unpleasant he really could make he tried. “Ah!” he said, his harsh voice, giving his hand rather graciously. “Good-morning, Mordaunt. I have found new employment, see.” He put his hand Cedric's shoulder,--perhaps deep his heart stir gratified pride heir he present; spark something like pleasure his eyes he moved boy slightly forward. “This new Lord Fauntleroy,” he said. “Fauntleroy, Mr. Mordaunt, rector parish.” Fauntleroy looked gentleman clerical garments, gave his hand. “I glad make acquaintance, sir,” he said, remembering words he heard Mr. Hobbs use one two occasions he greeting new customer ceremony. Cedric felt quite sure one ought usually polite minister. Mr. Mordaunt held small hand his moment he looked child's face, smiling involuntarily. He liked little fellow instant--as fact people always like him. And boy's beauty grace appealed him; simple, natural kindliness little lad made words he uttered, however quaint unexpected, sound pleasant sincere. As rector looked Cedric, he forgot think Earl all. Nothing world strong kind heart, somehow kind little heart, though heart child, seemed clear atmosphere big gloomy room make brighter. “I delighted make acquaintance, Lord Fauntleroy,” said rector. “You made long journey come us. A great many people glad know made safely.” “It WAS long way,” answered Fauntleroy, “but Dearest, mother, I was not lonely. Of course never lonely mother you; ship beautiful.” “Take chair, Mordaunt,” said Earl. Mr. Mordaunt sat down. He glanced Fauntleroy Earl. “Your lordship greatly congratulated,” he said warmly. But Earl plainly intention showing his feelings subject. “He like his father,” he said rather gruffly. “Let us hope he will conduct creditably.” And he added: “Well, morning, Mordaunt? Who trouble now?” This bad Mr. Mordaunt expected, he hesitated second he began. “It Higgins,” he said; “Higgins Edge Farm. He unfortunate. He ill last autumn, his children scarlet fever. I cannot say he good manager, he ill-luck, course he behindhand many ways. He trouble his rent now. Newick tells he does not pay it, he must leave place; course would serious matter. His wife ill, he came yesterday beg see it, ask time. He thinks would give time he could catch again.” “They think that,” said Earl, looking rather black. Fauntleroy made movement forward. He standing his grandfather visitor, listening his might. He begun interested Higgins once. He wondered many children were, scarlet fever hurt much. His eyes wide open fixed upon Mr. Mordaunt intent interest gentleman went conversation. “Higgins well-meaning man,” said rector, making effort strengthen his plea. “He bad enough tenant,” replied his lordship. “And he always behindhand, Newick tells me.” “He great trouble now,” said rector. “He fond his wife children, farm taken may literally starve. He give nourishing things need. Two children left low fever, doctor orders wine luxuries Higgins afford.” At Fauntleroy moved step nearer. “That way Michael,” he said. The Earl slightly started. “I forgot YOU!” he said. “I forgot philanthropist room. Who Michael?” And gleam queer amusement came back old man's deep-set eyes. “He Bridget's husband, fever,” answered Fauntleroy; “and he could not pay rent buy wine things. And gave money help him.” The Earl drew his brows together curious frown, somehow scarcely grim all. He glanced across Mr. Mordaunt. “I do not know sort landed proprietor he make,” he said. “I told Havisham boy he wanted--anything he wanted--and he wanted, seems, money give beggars.” “Oh! were not beggars,” said Fauntleroy eagerly. “Michael splendid bricklayer! They worked.” “Oh!” said Earl, “they beggars. They splendid bricklayers, bootblacks, apple-women.” He bent his gaze boy seconds silence. The fact new thought coming him, though, perhaps, prompted noblest emotions, bad thought. “Come here,” he said, last. Fauntleroy went stood near possible without encroaching gouty foot. “What would YOU case?” his lordship asked. It must confessed Mr. Mordaunt experienced moment curious sensation. Being man great thoughtfulness, spent many years estate Dorincourt, knowing tenantry, rich poor, people village, honest industrious, dishonest lazy, he realized strongly power good evil would given future one small boy standing there, his brown eyes wide open, his hands deep his pockets; thought came also great deal power might, perhaps, caprice proud, self-indulgent old man, given now, his young nature simple generous one, might worst thing could happen, others, himself. “And would YOU case?” demanded Earl. Fauntleroy drew little nearer, laid one hand his knee, confiding air good comradeship. “If I rich,” he said, “and little boy, I let stay, give things his children; then, I boy.” Then, second's pause, his face brightened visibly, “YOU anything, cannot you?” he said. “Humph!” said lord, staring him. “That is opinion, it?” And he displeased either. “I mean give one anything,” said Fauntleroy. “Who is Newick?” “He agent,” answered Earl, “and tenants over-fond him.” “Are going write letter now?” inquired Fauntleroy. “Shall I bring pen ink? I take game table.” It plainly instant occurred Newick would allowed his worst. The Earl paused moment, still looking him. “Can write?” he asked. “Yes,” answered Cedric, “but well.” “Move things table,” commanded lord, “and bring pen ink, sheet paper desk.” Mr. Mordaunt's interest began increase. Fauntleroy he told deftly. In moments, sheet paper, big inkstand, pen ready. “There!” he said gayly, “now write it.” “You write it,” said Earl. “I!” exclaimed Fauntleroy, flush overspread his forehead. “Will I write it? I do not always spell quite right I have not dictionary, nobody tells me.” “It do,” answered Earl. “Higgins complain spelling. I am philanthropist; are. Dip pen ink.” Fauntleroy took pen dipped ink-bottle, he arranged position, leaning table. “Now,” he inquired, “what must I say?” “You may say, 'Higgins interfered with, present,' sign it, 'Fauntleroy,'” said Earl. Fauntleroy dipped his pen ink again, resting his arm, began write. It rather slow serious process, he gave his whole soul it. After while, however, manuscript complete, he handed his grandfather smile slightly tinged anxiety. “Do think do?” he asked. The Earl looked it, corners his mouth twitched little. “Yes,” he answered; “Higgins find entirely satisfactory.” And he handed Mr. Mordaunt. What Mr. Mordaunt found written this: “Dear mr. Newik pleas mr. higins intur feared present oblige. Yours rispecferly, “FAUNTLEROY.” “Mr. Hobbs always signed his letters way,” said Fauntleroy; “and I thought I would better say 'please.' Is exactly right way spell 'interfered'?” “It is exactly way spelled dictionary,” answered Earl. “I afraid that,” said Fauntleroy. “I ought asked. You see, that is way words one syllable; look dictionary. It is always safest. I will write again.” And write he did, making quite imposing copy, taking precautions matter spelling consulting Earl himself. “Spelling curious thing,” he said. “It is often different expect be. I used think 'please' spelled p-l-e-e-s, is not, know; you would think 'dear' spelled d-e-r-e, did not inquire. Sometimes almost discourages you.” When Mr. Mordaunt went away, he took letter him, he took something else also--namely, pleasanter feeling hopeful one he ever carried home avenue previous visit he made Dorincourt Castle. When he gone, Fauntleroy, accompanied door, went back his grandfather. “May I go Dearest now?” he asked. “I think she waiting me.” The Earl silent moment. “There something stable see first,” he said. “Ring bell.” “If please,” said Fauntleroy, his quick little flush. “I am much obliged; I think I would better see to-morrow. She expecting time.” “Very well,” answered Earl. “We order carriage.” Then he added dryly, “It is pony.” Fauntleroy drew long breath. “A pony!” he exclaimed. “Whose pony it?” “Yours,” replied Earl. “Mine?” cried little fellow. “Mine--like things upstairs?” “Yes,” said his grandfather. “Would like see it? Shall I order brought around?” Fauntleroy's cheeks grew redder redder. “I never thought I pony!” he said. “I never thought that! How glad Dearest be. You give EVERYthing, do not you?” “Do wish see it?” inquired Earl. Fauntleroy drew long breath. “I WANT see it,” he said. “I want see much I hardly wait. But I am afraid is not time.” “You MUST go see mother afternoon?” asked Earl. “You think cannot put off?” “Why,” said Fauntleroy, “she thinking morning, I thinking her!” “Oh!” said Earl. “You have, you? Ring bell.” As drove avenue, arching trees, he rather silent. But Fauntleroy not. He talked pony. What color it? How big it? What name? What like eat best? How old it? How early morning might he get see it? “Dearest glad!” he kept saying. “She much obliged kind me! She knows I always liked ponies much, never thought I one. There little boy Fifth Avenue one, he used ride every morning used take walk past his house see him.” He leaned back cushions regarded Earl rapt interest minutes entire silence. “I think must best person world,” he burst forth last. “You always good, are not you?--and thinking people. Dearest says best kind goodness; think yourself, think people. That way are, is not it?” His lordship dumfounded find presented agreeable colors, he know exactly say. He felt he needed time reflection. To see his ugly, selfish motives changed good generous one simplicity child singular experience. Fauntleroy went on, still regarding admiring eyes--those great, clear, innocent eyes! “You make many people happy,” he said. “There is Michael Bridget ten children, apple-woman, Dick, Mr. Hobbs, Mr. Higgins Mrs. Higgins children, Mr. Mordaunt,--because course he glad,--and Dearest me, pony things. Do know, I have counted fingers mind, it is twenty-seven people you have kind to. That is good many--twenty-seven!” “And I person kind them--was I?” said Earl. “Why, yes, know,” answered Fauntleroy. “You made happy. Do know,” delicate hesitation, “that people sometimes mistaken earls do not know them. Mr. Hobbs was. I going write him, tell it.” “What Mr. Hobbs's opinion earls?” asked his lordship. “Well, see, difficulty was,” replied his young companion, “that he did not know any, he would read books. He thought--you must not mind it--that gory tyrants; he said he would not hanging around his store. But he would known YOU, I am sure he would felt quite different. I shall tell you.” “What shall tell him?” “I shall tell him,” said Fauntleroy, glowing enthusiasm, “that kindest man I ever heard of. And always thinking people, making happy and--and I hope I grow up, I shall like you.” “Just like me!” repeated his lordship, looking little kindling face. And dull red crept his withered skin, he suddenly turned his eyes away looked carriage window great beech-trees, sun shining glossy, red-brown leaves. “JUST like you,” said Fauntleroy, adding modestly, “if I can. Perhaps I am good enough, I am going try.” The carriage rolled stately avenue beautiful, broad-branched trees, spaces green shade lanes golden sunlight. Fauntleroy saw lovely places ferns grew high bluebells swayed breeze; he saw deer, standing lying deep grass, turn large, startled eyes carriage passed, caught glimpses brown rabbits scurried away. He heard whir partridges calls songs birds, seemed even beautiful before. All his heart filled pleasure happiness beauty every side. But old Earl saw heard different things, though he apparently looking too. He saw long life, neither generous deeds kind thoughts; he saw years man young strong rich powerful used his youth strength wealth power please kill time days years succeeded other; he saw man, time killed old age come, solitary without real friends midst his splendid wealth; he saw people disliked feared him, people would flatter cringe him, one really cared whether he lived died, unless something gain lose it. He looked broad acres belonged him, he knew Fauntleroy not--how far extended, wealth represented, many people homes soil. And he knew, too,--another thing Fauntleroy not,--that homes, humble well-to-do, probably one person, however much he envied wealth stately name power, however willing he would possess them, would instant thought calling noble owner “good,” wishing, simple-souled little boy had, like him. And exactly pleasant reflect upon, even cynical, worldly old man, sufficient unto seventy years never deigned care opinion world held long interfere his comfort entertainment. And fact was, indeed, he never condescended reflect upon all; he child believed better he was, wishing follow his illustrious footsteps imitate his example, suggested curious question whether he exactly person take model. Fauntleroy thought Earl's foot must hurting him, his brows knitted together so, he looked park; thinking this, considerate little fellow tried disturb him, enjoyed trees ferns deer silence. But last carriage, passed gates bowled green lanes short distance, stopped. They reached Court Lodge; Fauntleroy upon ground almost big footman time open carriage door. The Earl wakened his reverie start. “What!” he said. “Are here?” “Yes,” said Fauntleroy. “Let give stick. Just lean get out.” “I going get out,” replied his lordship brusquely. “Not--not see Dearest?” exclaimed Fauntleroy astonished face. “'Dearest' excuse me,” said Earl dryly. “Go her tell her even new pony would keep away.” “She disappointed,” said Fauntleroy. “She want see much.” “I afraid not,” answer. “The carriage call come back.--Tell Jeffries drive on, Thomas.” Thomas closed carriage door; and, puzzled look, Fauntleroy ran drive. The Earl opportunity--as Mr. Havisham had--of seeing pair handsome, strong little legs flash ground astonishing rapidity. Evidently owner intention losing time. The carriage rolled slowly away, his lordship lean back; he still looked out. Through space trees he could see house door; wide open. The little figure dashed steps; another figure--a little figure, too, slender young, black gown--ran meet it. It seemed flew together, Fauntleroy leaped his mother's arms, hanging her neck covering her sweet young face kisses. VII On following Sunday morning, Mr. Mordaunt large congregation. Indeed, he could scarcely remember Sunday church crowded. People appeared upon scene seldom honor coming hear his sermons. There even people Hazelton, next parish. There hearty, sunburned farmers, stout, comfortable, apple-cheeked wives best bonnets gorgeous shawls, half dozen children family. The doctor's wife there, her four daughters. Mrs. Kimsey Mr. Kimsey, kept druggist's shop, made pills, powders everybody within ten miles, sat pew; Mrs. Dibble hers; Miss Smiff, village dressmaker, her friend Miss Perkins, milliner, sat theirs; doctor's young man present, druggist's apprentice; fact, almost every family county side represented, one way another. In course preceding week, many wonderful stories told little Lord Fauntleroy. Mrs. Dibble kept busy attending customers came buy pennyworth needles ha'porth tape hear she relate, little shop bell door nearly tinkled death coming going. Mrs. Dibble knew exactly his small lordship's rooms furnished him, expensive toys bought, beautiful brown pony awaiting him, small groom attend it, little dog-cart, silver-mounted harness. And she could tell, too, servants said caught glimpses child night his arrival; every female stairs said shame, was, part poor pretty dear his mother; declared hearts came mouths he went alone library see his grandfather, “there knowing he would treated, his lordship's temper enough fluster old heads shoulders, let alone child.” “But you will believe me, Mrs. Jennifer, mum,” Mrs. Dibble said, “fear child know--so Mr. Thomas hisself says; an' set an' smile he did, an' talked his lordship they would friends ever since his first hour. An' Earl took aback, Mr. Thomas says, he could not nothing listen stare his eyebrows. An' it is Mr. Thomas's opinion, Mrs. Bates, mum, bad he is, he pleased his secret soul, an' proud, too; handsomer little fellow, better manners, though old-fashioned, Mr. Thomas says he would never wish see.” And come story Higgins. The Reverend Mr. Mordaunt told his dinner table, servants heard told kitchen, spread like wildfire. And market-day, Higgins appeared town, he questioned every side, Newick questioned too, response shown two three people note signed “Fauntleroy.” And farmers' wives found plenty talk tea shopping, done subject full justice made it. And Sunday either walked church driven gigs husbands, perhaps trifle curious new little lord time owner soil. It means Earl's habit attend church, he chose appear first Sunday--it his whim present huge family pew, Fauntleroy his side. There many loiterers churchyard, many lingerers lane morning. There groups gates porch, much discussion whether lord would really appear not. When discussion height, one good woman suddenly uttered exclamation. “Eh,” she said, “that must mother, pretty young thing.” All heard turned looked slender figure black coming path. The veil thrown back her face could see fair sweet was, bright hair curled softly child's little widow's cap. She thinking people about; she thinking Cedric, his visits her, his joy his new pony, he actually ridden her door day before, sitting straight looking proud happy. But soon she could help attracted fact she looked her arrival created sort sensation. She first noticed old woman red cloak made bobbing courtesy her, another thing said, “God bless you, lady!” one man another took his hat she passed. For moment she understand, she realized she little Lord Fauntleroy's mother so, she flushed rather shyly smiled bowed too, said, “Thank you,” gentle voice old woman blessed her. To person always lived bustling, crowded American city simple deference novel, first little embarrassing; all, she could help liking touched friendly warm-heartedness seemed speak. She scarcely passed stone porch church great event day happened. The carriage Castle, handsome horses tall liveried servants, bowled around corner green lane. “Here come!” went one looker-on another. And carriage drew up, Thomas stepped opened door, little boy, dressed black velvet, splendid mop bright waving hair, jumped out. Every man, woman, child looked curiously upon him. “He is Captain again!” said on-lookers remembered his father. “He is Captain's self, life!” He stood sunlight looking Earl, Thomas helped nobleman out, affectionate interest could imagined. The instant he could help, he put his hand offered his shoulder he seven feet high. It plain enough every one however might people, Earl Dorincourt struck terror breast his grandson. “Just lean me,” heard say. “How glad people see you, well seem know you!” “Take cap, Fauntleroy,” said Earl. “They bowing you.” “To me!” cried Fauntleroy, whipping his cap moment, baring his bright head crowd turning shining, puzzled eyes he tried bow every one once. “God bless lordship!” said courtesying, red-cloaked old woman spoken his mother; “long life you!” “Thank you, madam,” said Fauntleroy. And went church, looked there, way aisle square, red-cushioned curtained pew. When Fauntleroy fairly seated, he made two discoveries pleased him: first that, across church he could look her, his mother sat smiled him; second, one end pew, wall, knelt two quaint figures carven stone, facing kneeled either side pillar supporting two stone missals, pointed hands folded prayer, dress antique strange. On tablet written something he could read curious words: “Here lyeth ye bodye Gregorye Arthure Fyrst Earle Dorincourt Allsoe Alisone Hildegarde hys wyfe.” “May I whisper?” inquired his lordship, devoured curiosity. “What it?” said his grandfather. “Who they?” “Some ancestors,” answered Earl, “who lived hundred years ago.” “Perhaps,” said Lord Fauntleroy, regarding respect, “perhaps I got spelling them.” And he proceeded find his place church service. When music began, he stood looked across his mother, smiling. He fond music, his mother he often sang together, he joined rest, his pure, sweet, high voice rising clear song bird. He quite forgot his pleasure it. The Earl forgot little too, he sat his curtain-shielded corner pew watched boy. Cedric stood big psalter open his hands, singing his childish might, his face little uplifted, happily; he sang, long ray sunshine crept and, slanting golden pane stained glass window, brightened falling hair his young head. His mother, she looked across church, felt thrill pass her heart, prayer rose too,--a prayer pure, simple happiness his childish soul might last, strange, great fortune fallen might bring wrong evil it. There many soft, anxious thoughts her tender heart new days. “Oh, Ceddie!” she said evening before, she hung saying good-night, he went away; “oh, Ceddie, dear, I wish sake I clever could say great many wise things! But good, dear, brave, kind true always, never hurt one, long live, may help many, big world may better little child born. And best all, Ceddie,--it better everything else, world little better man lived--even ever little better, dearest.” And his return Castle, Fauntleroy repeated her words his grandfather. “And I thought she said that,” he ended; “and I told her way world lived, I going try I could like you.” “And she say that?” asked his lordship, trifle uneasily. “She said right, must always look good people try like it.” Perhaps old man remembered he glanced divided folds red curtain his pew. Many times he looked people's heads his son's wife sat alone, he saw fair face unforgiven dead loved, eyes like child his side; his thoughts were, whether hard bitter, softened little, would hard discover. As came church, many attended service stood waiting see pass. As neared gate, man stood his hat his hand made step forward hesitated. He middle-aged farmer, careworn face. “Well, Higgins,” said Earl. Fauntleroy turned quickly look him. “Oh!” he exclaimed, “is Mr. Higgins?” “Yes,” answered Earl dryly; “and I suppose he came take look his new landlord.” “Yes, lord,” said man, his sunburned face reddening. “Mr. Newick told his young lordship kind enough speak me, I thought I would like say word thanks, I might allowed.” Perhaps he felt wonder he saw little fellow innocently done much him, stood looking one his less fortunate children might done--apparently realizing his importance least. “I have great deal thank lordship for,” he said; “a great deal. I----” “Oh,” said Fauntleroy; “I wrote letter. It grandfather it. But know he always good everybody. Is Mrs. Higgins well now?” Higgins looked trifle taken aback. He also somewhat startled hearing his noble landlord presented character benevolent being, full engaging qualities. “I--well, yes, lordship,” he stammered, “the missus better since trouble took her mind. It worrying broke her down.” “I am glad that,” said Fauntleroy. “My grandfather sorry children scarlet fever, I. He children himself. I am his son's little boy, know.” Higgins verge panic-stricken. He felt would safer discreet plan look Earl, well known his fatherly affection his sons he seen twice year, ill, he promptly departed London, he would bored doctors nurses. It little trying, therefore, his lordship's nerves told, he looked on, his eyes gleaming his shaggy eyebrows, he felt interest scarlet fever. “You see, Higgins,” broke Earl fine grim smile, “you people mistaken me. Lord Fauntleroy understands me. When want reliable information subject character, apply him. Get carriage, Fauntleroy.” And Fauntleroy jumped in, carriage rolled away green lane, even turned corner high road, Earl still grimly smiling. VIII Lord Dorincourt occasion wear his grim smile many time days passed by. Indeed, his acquaintance his grandson progressed, he wore smile often moments almost lost grimness. There denying Lord Fauntleroy appeared scene, old man growing tired his loneliness his gout his seventy years. After long life excitement amusement, agreeable sit alone even splendid room, one foot gout-stool, diversion flying rage, shouting frightened footman hated sight him. The old Earl clever man know perfectly well his servants detested him, even he visitors, come love him--though found sort amusement his sharp, sarcastic talk, spared one. So long he strong well, he gone one place another, pretending amuse himself, though he really enjoyed it; his health began fail, he felt tired everything shut Dorincourt, his gout his newspapers his books. But he could read time, he became “bored,” he called it. He hated long nights days, he grew savage irritable. And Fauntleroy came; Earl saw him, fortunately little fellow, secret pride grandfather gratified outset. If Cedric less handsome little fellow, old man might taken strong dislike he would given chance see his grandson's finer qualities. But he chose think Cedric's beauty fearless spirit results Dorincourt blood credit Dorincourt rank. And he heard lad talk, saw well-bred little fellow he was, notwithstanding his boyish ignorance his new position meant, old Earl liked his grandson more, actually began find rather entertained. It amused give childish hands power bestow benefit poor Higgins. My lord cared nothing poor Higgins, pleased little think his grandson would talked country people would begin popular tenantry, even his childhood. Then gratified drive church Cedric see excitement interest caused arrival. He knew people would speak beauty little lad; his fine, strong, straight body; his erect bearing, his handsome face, his bright hair, would say (as Earl heard one woman exclaim another) boy “every inch lord.” My lord Dorincourt arrogant old man, proud his name, proud his rank, therefore proud show world last House Dorincourt heir worthy position he fill. The morning new pony tried, Earl pleased he almost forgotten his gout. When groom brought pretty creature, arched brown, glossy neck tossed fine head sun, Earl sat open window library looked Fauntleroy took his first riding lesson. He wondered boy would show signs timidity. It small pony, he often seen children lose courage making first essay riding. Fauntleroy mounted great delight. He never pony before, he highest spirits. Wilkins, groom, led animal bridle library window. “He is well plucked un, he is,” Wilkins remarked stable afterward many grins. “It were not trouble put HIM up. An' old un would not ha' sat straighter he WERE up. He ses--ses he me, 'Wilkins,' he ses,  I sitting straight? They sit straight circus,' ses he. An' I ses, 'As straight arrer, lordship!'--an' he laughs, pleased could be, an' he ses, 'That is right,' he ses, 'you tell I do not sit straight, Wilkins!'” But sitting straight led walk altogether completely satisfactory. After minutes, Fauntleroy spoke his grandfather--watching window: “Cannot I go myself?” he asked; “and cannot I go faster? The boy Fifth Avenue used trot canter!” “Do think could trot canter?” said Earl. “I like try,” answered Fauntleroy. His lordship made sign Wilkins, signal brought his horse mounted took Fauntleroy's pony leading-rein. “Now,” said Earl, “let trot.” The next minutes rather exciting small equestrian. He found trotting easy walking, faster pony trotted, less easy was. “It j-jolts g-goo-good deal--do-does not it?” he said Wilkins. “D-does j-jolt y-you?” “No, lord,” answered Wilkins. “You will get used time. Rise stirrups.” “I am ri-rising t-time,” said Fauntleroy. He rising falling rather uncomfortably many shakes bounces. He breath his face grew red, he held his might, sat straight he could. The Earl could see his window. When riders came back within speaking distance, hidden trees minutes, Fauntleroy's hat off, his cheeks like poppies, his lips set, he still trotting manfully. “Stop minute!” said his grandfather. “Where is hat?” Wilkins touched his. “It fell off, lordship,” he said, evident enjoyment. “Would not let stop pick up, lord.” “Not much afraid, he?” asked Earl dryly. “Him, lordship!” exclaimed Wilkins. “I should not say he knowed meant. I have taught young gen'lemen ride afore, an' I never see one stick determinder.” “Tired?” said Earl Fauntleroy. “Want get off?” “It jolts think will,” admitted his young lordship frankly. “And tires little, too; I do not want get off. I want learn how. As soon I have got breath I want go back hat.” The cleverest person world, he undertaken teach Fauntleroy please old man watched him, could taught anything would succeeded better. As pony trotted toward avenue, faint color crept fierce old face, eyes, shaggy brows, gleamed pleasure his lordship scarcely expected know again. And he sat watched quite eagerly sound horses' hoofs returned. When come, time, came faster pace. Fauntleroy's hat still off; Wilkins carrying him; his cheeks redder before, his hair flying his ears, he came quite brisk canter. “There!” he panted, drew up, “I c-cantered. I did not well boy Fifth Avenue, I it, I staid on!” He Wilkins pony close friends that. Scarcely day passed country people see together, cantering gayly highroad green lanes. The children cottages would run door look proud little brown pony gallant little figure sitting straight saddle, young lord would snatch his cap swing them, shout, “Hullo! Good-morning!” unlordly manner, though great heartiness. Sometimes he would stop talk children, Wilkins came back castle story Fauntleroy insisted dismounting near village school, boy lame tired might ride home his pony. “An' I am blessed,” said Wilkins, telling story stables,--“I am blessed he would hear anything else! He would not let get down, he said boy might not feel comfortable big horse. An' ses he, 'Wilkins,' ses he, 'that boy's lame I am not, I want talk him, too.' And lad get, lord trudges alongside his hands his pockets, his cap back his head, a-whistling talking easy please! And come cottage, an' boy's mother come taking see what is up, he whips his cap an' ses he, 'I have brought son home, madam,' ses he, 'because his leg hurt him, I do not think stick enough lean on; I am going ask grandfather pair crutches made him.' An' I am blessed woman was not struck heap, well she might be! I thought I 'a' hex-plodid, myself!” When Earl heard story he angry, Wilkins half afraid he would be; contrary, he laughed outright, called Fauntleroy him, made tell matter beginning end, he laughed again. And actually, days later, Dorincourt carriage stopped green lane cottage lame boy lived, Fauntleroy jumped walked door, carrying pair strong, light, new crutches shouldered like gun, presented Mrs. Hartle (the lame boy's name Hartle) words: “My grandfather's compliments, please, boy, hope he get better.” “I said compliments,” he explained Earl he returned carriage. “You did not tell to, I thought perhaps forgot. That right, was not it?” And Earl laughed again, say not. In fact, two becoming intimate every day, every day Fauntleroy's faith his lordship's benevolence virtue increased. He doubt whatever his grandfather amiable generous elderly gentlemen. Certainly, he found his wishes gratified almost uttered; gifts pleasures lavished upon him, he sometimes almost bewildered his possessions. Apparently, he everything he wanted, everything he wished do. And though would certainly wise plan pursue small boys, his young lordship bore amazingly well. Perhaps, notwithstanding his sweet nature, he might somewhat spoiled it, hours he spent his mother Court Lodge. That “best friend” his watched ever closely tenderly. The two many long talks together, he never went back Castle her kisses his cheeks without carrying his heart simple, pure words worth remembering. There one thing, true, puzzled little fellow much. He thought mystery much oftener one supposed; even his mother know often he pondered it; Earl long time never suspected he all. But, quick observe, little boy could help wondering his mother grandfather never seemed meet. He noticed never meet. When Dorincourt carriage stopped Court Lodge, Earl never alighted, rare occasions his lordship's going church, Fauntleroy always left speak his mother porch alone, perhaps go home her. And yet, every day, fruit flowers sent Court Lodge hot-houses Castle. But one virtuous action Earl's set upon pinnacle perfection Cedric's eyes, he done soon first Sunday Mrs. Errol walked home church unattended. About week later, Cedric going one day visit his mother, he found door, instead large carriage prancing pair, pretty little brougham handsome bay horse. “That present mother,” Earl said abruptly. “She go walking country. She needs carriage. The man drives take charge it. It present YOU.” Fauntleroy's delight could feebly express itself. He could scarcely contain he reached lodge. His mother gathering roses garden. He flung little brougham flew her. “Dearest!” he cried, “could believe it? This yours! He says present me. It carriage drive everywhere in!” He happy she know say. She could borne spoil his pleasure refusing accept gift even though came man chose consider her enemy. She obliged step carriage, roses all, let herself taken drive, Fauntleroy told her stories his grandfather's goodness amiability. They innocent stories sometimes she could help laughing little, she would draw her little boy closer her side kiss him, feeling glad he could see good old man, friends. The next day that, Fauntleroy wrote Mr. Hobbs. He wrote quite long letter, first copy written, he brought his grandfather inspected. “Because,” he said, “it is uncertain spelling. And you will tell mistakes, I will write again.” This he written: “My dear mr hobbs want tell granfarther he best earl ever new mistake earls tirents he tirent wish new would good friends sure would he gout his foot grate sufrer he pashent love every day becaus one could help loving earl like kind every one world wish could talk he knows everything world ask question he never plaid base ball he given pony cart mamma bewtifle cariage I three rooms toys kinds would serprise would like castle park large castle could lose wilkins tells wilkins groom he says dungon castle pretty everything park would serprise big trees deers rabbits games flying cover granfarther rich he proud orty thought earls always like people polite kind take hats women make curtsies sometimes say god bless ride first shook troted granfarther let poor man stay his farm he could pay his rent mrs mellon went take wine things his sick children like see wish dearest could live castle happy do not miss her much love granfarther every one plees write soon “your afechshnet old frend “Cedric Errol “p one dungon granfarfher never one langwishin there. “p he good earl he reminds he unerversle favrit” “Do miss mother much?” asked Earl he finished reading this. “Yes,” said Fauntleroy, “I miss her time.” He went stood Earl put his hand his knee, looking him. “YOU do not miss her, you?” he said. “I do not know her,” answered his lordship rather crustily. “I know that,” said Fauntleroy, “and that is makes wonder. She told ask questions, and--and I will not, sometimes I cannot help thinking, know, makes puzzled. But I am going ask questions. And I miss her much, I go look window I see her light shine every night open place trees. It long way off, she puts her window soon dark, I see twinkle far away, I know says.” “What say?” asked lord. “It says, 'Good-night, God keep night!'--just she used say together. Every night she used say me, every morning she said, 'God bless day!' So see I quite safe time----” “Quite, I doubt,” said his lordship dryly. And he drew his beetling eyebrows looked little boy fixedly long Fauntleroy wondered he could thinking of. IX The fact was, his lordship Earl Dorincourt thought days, many things he never thought before, his thoughts one way another connected his grandson. His pride strongest part his nature, boy gratified every point. Through pride he began find new interest life. He began take pleasure showing his heir world. The world known his disappointment his sons; agreeable touch triumph exhibiting new Lord Fauntleroy, could disappoint one. He wished child appreciate his power understand splendor his position; he wished others realize too. He made plans his future. Sometimes secret he actually found wishing his past life better one, less pure, childish heart would shrink knew truth. It agreeable think beautiful, innocent face would look owner made chance understand his grandfather called many year “the wicked Earl Dorincourt.” The thought even made feel trifle nervous. He wish boy find out. Sometimes new interest he forgot his gout, his doctor surprised find his noble patient's health growing better he expected ever would again. Perhaps Earl grew better time pass slowly him, he something think beside his pains infirmities. One fine morning, people amazed see little Lord Fauntleroy riding his pony another companion Wilkins. This new companion rode tall, powerful gray horse, Earl himself. It was, fact, Fauntleroy suggested plan. As he point mounting his pony, he said rather wistfully his grandfather: “I wish going me. When I go away I feel lonely left big castle. I wish could ride too.” And greatest excitement aroused stables minutes later arrival order Selim saddled Earl. After that, Selim saddled almost every day; people became accustomed sight tall gray horse carrying tall gray old man, his handsome, fierce, eagle face, side brown pony bore little Lord Fauntleroy. And rides together green lanes pretty country roads, two riders became intimate ever. And gradually old man heard great deal “Dearest” her life. As Fauntleroy trotted big horse he chatted gayly. There could well brighter little comrade, his nature happy. It he talked most. The Earl often silent, listening watching joyous, glowing face. Sometimes he would tell his young companion set pony gallop, little fellow dashed off, sitting straight fearless, he would watch gleam pride pleasure his eyes; when, dash, Fauntleroy came back waving his cap laughing shout, he always felt he his grandfather good friends indeed. One thing Earl discovered his son's wife lead idle life. It long he learned poor people knew her well indeed. When sickness sorrow poverty house, little brougham often stood door. “Do know,” said Fauntleroy once, “they say, 'God bless you!' see her, children glad. There go her house taught sew. She says she feels rich she wants help poor ones.” It displeased Earl find mother his heir beautiful young face looked much like lady she duchess; one way displease know she popular beloved poor. And yet he often conscious hard, jealous pang he saw she filled her child's heart boy clung her his best beloved. The old man would desired stand first rival. That morning he drew his horse elevated point moor rode, made gesture his whip, broad, beautiful landscape spread them. “Do know land belongs me?” he said Fauntleroy. “Does it?” answered Fauntleroy. “How much belong one person, beautiful!” “Do know day belong you--that great deal more?” “To me!” exclaimed Fauntleroy rather awe-stricken voice. “When?” “When I dead,” his grandfather answered. “Then I do not want it,” said Fauntleroy; “I want live always.” “That is kind,” answered Earl his dry way; “nevertheless, day yours--some day Earl Dorincourt.” Little Lord Fauntleroy sat still his saddle moments. He looked broad moors, green farms, beautiful copses, cottages lanes, pretty village, trees turrets great castle rose, gray stately. Then he gave queer little sigh. “What thinking of?” asked Earl. “I thinking,” replied Fauntleroy, “what little boy I am! Dearest said me.” “What it?” inquired Earl. “She said perhaps easy rich; one many things always, one might sometimes forget every one else fortunate, one rich always careful try remember. I talking her good were, she said good thing, earl much power, he cared his pleasure never thought people lived his lands, might trouble he could help--and many people, would hard thing. And I looking houses, thinking I find people, I earl. How find them?” As his lordship's knowledge his tenantry consisted finding paid rent promptly, turning not, rather hard question. “Newick finds me,” he said, he pulled his great gray mustache, looked his small questioner rather uneasily. “We go home now,” he added; “and earl, see better earl I been!” He silent rode home. He felt almost incredible he never really loved one his life, find growing fond little fellow,--as without doubt he was. At first he pleased proud Cedric's beauty bravery, something pride his feeling now. He laughed grim, dry laugh sometimes, he thought he liked boy near him, he liked hear his voice, secret he really wished liked thought well his small grandson. “I am old fellow dotage, I nothing else think of,” he would say himself; yet he knew altogether. And he allowed admit truth, he would perhaps found obliged things attracted him, spite himself, qualities he never possessed--the frank, true, kindly nature, affectionate trustfulness could never think evil. It week ride when, visit his mother, Fauntleroy came library troubled, thoughtful face. He sat high-backed chair he sat evening his arrival, he looked embers hearth. The Earl watched silence, wondering coming. It evident Cedric something his mind. At last he looked up. “Does Newick know people?” he asked. “It his business know them,” said his lordship. “Been neglecting it--has he?” Contradictory may seem, nothing entertained edified little fellow's interest his tenantry. He never taken interest himself, pleased well enough that, his childish habits thought midst his childish amusements high spirits, quaint seriousness working curly head. “There place,” said Fauntleroy, looking wide-open, horror-stricken eye--“Dearest seen it; end village. The houses close together, almost falling down; scarcely breathe; people poor, everything dreadful! Often fever, children die; makes wicked live like that, poor miserable! It worse Michael Bridget! The rain comes roof! Dearest went see poor woman lived there. She would let come near her she changed her things. The tears ran her cheeks she told it!” The tears come his eyes, he smiled them. “I told her did not know, I would tell you,” he said. He jumped came leaned Earl's chair. “You make right,” he said, “just made right Higgins. You always make right everybody. I told her would, Newick must forgotten tell you.” The Earl looked hand his knee. Newick forgotten tell him; fact, Newick spoken desperate condition end village known Earl's Court. He knew tumble-down, miserable cottages, bad drainage, damp walls broken windows leaking roofs, poverty, fever, misery. Mr. Mordaunt painted strongest words he could use, his lordship used violent language response; and, his gout worst, he said sooner people Earl's Court died buried parish better would be,--and end matter. And yet, he looked small hand his knee, small hand honest, earnest, frank-eyed face, he actually little ashamed Earl's Court himself. “What!” he said; “you want make builder model cottages me, you?” And he positively put his hand upon childish one stroked it. “Those must pulled down,” said Fauntleroy, great eagerness. “Dearest says so. Let us--let us go pulled to-morrow. The people glad see you! They will know come help them!” And his eyes shone like stars his glowing face. The Earl rose his chair put his hand child's shoulder. “Let us go take walk terrace,” he said, short laugh; “and talk over.” And though he laughed two three times again, walked fro broad stone terrace, walked together almost every fine evening, he seemed thinking something displease him, still he kept his hand his small companion's shoulder. X The truth Mrs. Errol found great many sad things course her work among poor little village appeared picturesque seen moor-sides. Everything picturesque, seen near by, looked distance. She found idleness poverty ignorance comfort industry. And she discovered, while, Erleboro considered worst village part country. Mr. Mordaunt told her great many his difficulties discouragements, she found great deal herself. The agents managed property always chosen please Earl, cared nothing degradation wretchedness poor tenants. Many things, therefore, neglected attended to, matters gone bad worse. As Earl's Court, disgrace, dilapidated houses miserable, careless, sickly people. When first Mrs. Errol went place, made her shudder. Such ugliness slovenliness want seemed worse country place city. It seemed might helped. And she looked squalid, uncared-for children growing midst vice brutal indifference, she thought her little boy spending his days great, splendid castle, guarded served like young prince, wish ungratified, knowing nothing luxury ease beauty. And bold thought came her wise little mother-heart. Gradually she begun see, others, her boy's good fortune please Earl much, he would scarcely likely denied anything he expressed desire. “The Earl would give anything,” she said Mr. Mordaunt. “He would indulge his every whim. Why indulgence used good others? It see shall come pass.” She knew she could trust kind, childish heart; she told little fellow story Earl's Court, feeling sure he would speak his grandfather, hoping good results would follow. And strange appeared every one, good results follow. The fact strongest power influence Earl his grandson's perfect confidence him--the fact Cedric always believed his grandfather going right generous. He could quite make his mind let discover he inclination generous all, he wanted his way occasions, whether right wrong. It novelty regarded admiration benefactor entire human race, soul nobility, he enjoy idea looking affectionate brown eyes, saying: “I violent, selfish old rascal; I never generous thing life, I do not care Earl's Court poor people”--or something would amount thing. He actually learned fond enough small boy mop yellow love-locks, feel he would prefer guilty amiable action then. And so--though he laughed himself--after reflection, he sent Newick, quite long interview subject Court, decided wretched hovels pulled new houses built. “It Lord Fauntleroy insists it,” he said dryly; “he thinks improve property. You tell tenants it is his idea.” And he looked his small lordship, lying hearth-rug playing Dougal. The great dog lad's constant companion, followed everywhere, stalking solemnly he walked, trotting majestically behind he rode drove. Of course, country people town people heard proposed improvement. At first, many would believe it; small army workmen arrived commenced pulling crazy, squalid cottages, people began understand little Lord Fauntleroy done good turn again, his innocent interference scandal Earl's Court last removed. If he known talked praised everywhere, prophesied great things he grew up, astonished he would been! But he never suspected it. He lived his simple, happy, child life,--frolicking park; chasing rabbits burrows; lying trees grass, rug library, reading wonderful books talking Earl them, telling stories his mother; writing long letters Dick Mr. Hobbs, responded characteristic fashion; riding his grandfather's side, Wilkins escort. As rode market town, he used see people turn look, he noticed lifted hats faces often brightened much; he thought his grandfather him. “They fond you,” he said, looking his lordship bright smile. “Do see glad see you? I hope day fond me. It must nice EVERYbody like you.” And he felt quite proud grandson greatly admired beloved individual. When cottages built, lad his grandfather used ride Earl's Court together look them, Fauntleroy full interest. He would dismount his pony go make acquaintance workmen, asking questions building bricklaying, telling things America. After two three conversations, he able enlighten Earl subject brick-making, rode home. “I always like know things like those,” he said, “because never know coming to.” When he left them, workmen used talk among themselves, laugh his odd, innocent speeches; liked him, liked see stand among them, talking away, his hands his pockets, his hat pushed back his curls, his small face full eagerness. “He is rare un,” used say. “An' noice little outspoken chap, too. Not much th' bad stock him.” And would go home tell wives him, women would tell other, came almost every one talked of, knew story of, little Lord Fauntleroy; gradually almost every one knew “wicked Earl” found something he cared last--something touched even warmed his hard, bitter old heart. But one knew quite much warmed, day day old man found caring child, creature ever trusted him. He found looking forward time Cedric would young man, strong beautiful, life him, still kind heart power make friends everywhere, Earl wondered lad would do, he would use his gifts. Often he watched little fellow lying upon hearth, conning big book, light shining bright young head, his old eyes would gleam his cheek would flush. “The boy anything,” he would say himself, “anything!” He never spoke one else his feeling Cedric; he spoke others always grim smile. But Fauntleroy soon knew his grandfather loved always liked near--near his chair library, opposite table, his side he rode drove took his evening walk broad terrace. “Do remember,” Cedric said once, looking his book he lay rug, “do remember I said first night good companions? I do not think people could better companions are, you?” “We pretty good companions, I say,” replied his lordship. “Come here.” Fauntleroy scrambled went him. “Is anything want,” Earl asked; “anything not?” The little fellow's brown eyes fixed his grandfather rather wistful look. “Only one thing,” he answered. “What that?” inquired Earl. Fauntleroy silent second. He thought matters long nothing. “What it?” lord repeated. Fauntleroy answered. “It Dearest,” he said. The old Earl winced little. “But see her almost every day,” he said. “Is enough?” “I used see her time,” said Fauntleroy. “She used kiss I went sleep night, morning she always there, could tell things without waiting.” The old eyes young ones looked moment silence. Then Earl knitted his brows. “Do NEVER forget mother?” he said. “No,” answered Fauntleroy, “never; she never forgets me. I should not forget YOU, know, I did not live you. I think more.” “Upon word,” said Earl, looking moment longer, “I believe would!” The jealous pang came boy spoke his mother seemed even stronger before; stronger old man's increasing affection boy. But long he pangs, much harder face he almost forgot, time, he ever hated his son's wife all. And strange startling way happened. One evening, Earl's Court cottages completed, grand dinner party Dorincourt. There party Castle long time. A days took place, Sir Harry Lorridaile Lady Lorridaile, Earl's sister, actually came visit--a thing caused greatest excitement village set Mrs. Dibble's shop-bell tinkling madly again, well known Lady Lorridaile Dorincourt since her marriage, thirty-five years before. She handsome old lady white curls dimpled, peachy cheeks, she good gold, she never approved her brother rest world, strong her afraid speak her mind frankly, she had, several lively quarrels his lordship, seen little since her young days. She heard great deal pleasant years separated. She heard his neglect his wife, poor lady's death; his indifference his children; two weak, vicious, unprepossessing elder boys credit one else. Those two elder sons, Bevis Maurice, she never seen; come Lorridaile Park tall, stalwart, beautiful young fellow eighteen years old, told her he her nephew Cedric Errol, he come see her he passing near place wished look his Aunt Constantia he heard his mother speak. Lady Lorridaile's kind heart warmed sight young man, she made stay her week, petted him, made much admired immensely. He sweet-tempered, light-hearted, spirited lad, he went away, she hoped see often again; she never did, Earl bad humor he went back Dorincourt, forbidden ever go Lorridaile Park again. But Lady Lorridaile always remembered tenderly, though she feared he made rash marriage America, she angry she heard he cast his father one really knew he lived. At last came rumor his death, Bevis thrown his horse killed, Maurice died Rome fever; soon came story American child found brought home Lord Fauntleroy. “Probably ruined others were,” she said her husband, “unless his mother good enough her help her take care him.” But she heard Cedric's mother parted she almost indignant words. “It disgraceful, Harry!” she said. “Fancy child age taken his mother, made companion man like brother! He either brutal boy indulge he little monster. If I thought would good write----” “It would not, Constantia,” said Sir Harry. “I know would not,” she answered. “I know his lordship Earl Dorincourt well;--but outrageous.” Not poor people farmers heard little Lord Fauntleroy; others knew him. He talked much many stories him--of his beauty, his sweet temper, his popularity, his growing influence Earl, his grandfather--that rumors reached gentry country places he heard one county England. People talked dinner tables, ladies pitied his young mother, wondered boy handsome he said be, men knew Earl his habits laughed heartily stories little fellow's belief his lordship's amiability. Sir Thomas Asshe Asshawe Hall, Erleboro one day, met Earl his grandson riding together, stopped shake hands lord congratulate his change looks his recovery gout. “And, d' ye know,” he said, he spoke incident afterward, “the old man looked proud turkey-cock; upon word I do not wonder, handsomer, finer lad his grandson I never saw! As straight dart, sat his pony like young trooper!” And degrees Lady Lorridaile, too, heard child; she heard Higgins lame boy, cottages Earl's Court, score things,--and she began wish see little fellow. And she wondering might brought about, her utter astonishment, she received letter her brother inviting her come her husband Dorincourt. “It seems incredible!” she exclaimed. “I heard said child worked miracles, I begin believe it. They say brother adores boy scarcely endure sight. And he proud him! Actually, I believe he wants show us.” And she accepted invitation once. When she reached Dorincourt Castle Sir Harry, late afternoon, she went her room seeing her brother. Having dressed dinner, she entered drawing-room. The Earl standing near fire looking tall imposing; his side stood little boy black velvet, large Vandyke collar rich lace--a little fellow whose round bright face handsome, turned upon her beautiful, candid brown eyes, she almost uttered exclamation pleasure surprise sight. As she shook hands Earl, she called name she used since her girlhood. “What, Molyneux!” she said, “is child?” “Yes, Constantia,” answered Earl, “this boy. Fauntleroy, grand-aunt, Lady Lorridaile.” “How do, Grand-Aunt?” said Fauntleroy. Lady Lorridaile put her hand his shoulders, looking his upraised face seconds, kissed warmly. “I Aunt Constantia,” she said, “and I loved poor papa, like him.” “It makes glad I told I like him,” answered Fauntleroy, “because seems every one liked him,--just like Dearest, eszackly,--Aunt Constantia” (adding two words second's pause). Lady Lorridaile delighted. She bent kissed again, moment warm friends. “Well, Molyneux,” she said aside Earl afterward, “it could possibly better this!” “I think not,” answered his lordship dryly. “He fine little fellow. We great friends. He believes charming sweet-tempered philanthropists. I confess you, Constantia,--as would find I not,--that I slight danger becoming rather old fool him.” “What his mother think you?” asked Lady Lorridaile, her usual straightforwardness. “I asked her,” answered Earl, slightly scowling. “Well,” said Lady Lorridaile, “I frank outset, Molyneux, tell I do not approve course, intention call Mrs. Errol soon possible; wish quarrel me, better mention once. What I hear young creature makes quite sure her child owes her everything. We told even Lorridaile Park poorer tenants adore her already.” “They adore HIM,” said Earl, nodding toward Fauntleroy. “As Mrs. Errol, you will find her pretty little woman. I am rather debt her giving her beauty boy, go see her like. All I ask she remain Court Lodge ask go see her,” he scowled little again. “But he does not hate her much he used to, plain enough me,” her ladyship said Sir Harry afterward. “And he changed man measure, and, incredible may seem, Harry, opinion he made human being, nothing less his affection innocent, affectionate little fellow. Why, child actually loves him--leans his chair his knee. His children would soon thought nestling tiger.” The next day she went call upon Mrs. Errol. When she returned, she said her brother: “Molyneux, she loveliest little woman I ever saw! She voice like silver bell, may thank her making boy he is. She given her beauty, make great mistake persuading her come take charge you. I shall invite her Lorridaile.” “She will leave boy,” replied Earl. “I must boy too,” said Lady Lorridaile, laughing. But she knew Fauntleroy would given her, day she saw clearly closely two grown other, proud, grim old man's ambition hope love centered child, warm, innocent nature returned his affection perfect trust good faith. She knew, too, prime reason great dinner party Earl's secret desire show world his grandson heir, let people see boy much spoken described even finer little specimen boyhood rumor made him. “Bevis Maurice bitter humiliation him,” she said her husband. “Every one knew it. He actually hated them. His pride full sway here.” Perhaps one person accepted invitation without feeling curiosity little Lord Fauntleroy, wondering he would view. And time came he view. “The lad good manners,” said Earl. “He one's way. Children usually idiots bores,--mine both,--but he actually answer he is spoken to, silent he not. He never offensive.” But he allowed silent long. Every one something say him. The fact wished make talk. The ladies petted asked questions, men asked questions too, joked him, men steamer done he crossed Atlantic. Fauntleroy quite understand laughed sometimes he answered them, he used seeing people amused he quite serious, he mind. He thought whole evening delightful. The magnificent rooms brilliant lights, many flowers, gentlemen seemed gay, ladies wore beautiful, wonderful dresses, sparkling ornaments hair necks. There one young lady who, he heard say, come London, she spent “season”; she charming he could keep his eyes her. She rather tall young lady proud little head, soft dark hair, large eyes color purple pansies, color her cheeks lips like rose. She dressed beautiful white dress, pearls around her throat. There one strange thing young lady. So many gentlemen stood near her, seemed anxious please her, Fauntleroy thought she must something like princess. He much interested her without knowing he drew nearer nearer her, last she turned spoke him. “Come here, Lord Fauntleroy,” she said, smiling; “and tell look so.” “I thinking beautiful are,” his young lordship replied. Then gentlemen laughed outright, young lady laughed little too, rose color her cheeks brightened. “Ah, Fauntleroy,” said one gentlemen laughed heartily, “make time! When older courage say that.” “But nobody could help saying it,” said Fauntleroy sweetly. “Could help it? Do not YOU think she pretty, too?” “We allowed say think,” said gentleman, rest laughed ever. But beautiful young lady--her name Miss Vivian Herbert--put her hand drew Cedric her side, looking prettier before, possible. “Lord Fauntleroy shall say he thinks,” she said; “and I much obliged him. I sure he thinks he says.” And she kissed his cheek. “I think prettier one I ever saw,” said Fauntleroy, looking her innocent, admiring eyes, “except Dearest. Of course, I could not think one QUITE pretty Dearest. I think she prettiest person world.” “I sure she is,” said Miss Vivian Herbert. And she laughed kissed his cheek again. She kept her side great part evening, group center gay. He know happened, long he telling America, Republican Rally, Mr. Hobbs Dick, end he proudly produced his pocket Dick's parting gift,--the red silk handkerchief. “I put pocket to-night party,” he said. “I thought Dick would like wear party.” And queer big, flaming, spotted thing was, serious, affectionate look his eyes, prevented his audience laughing much. “You see, I like it,” he said, “because Dick friend.” But though he talked much, Earl said, he one's way. He could quiet listen others talked, one found tiresome. A slight smile crossed one face several times he went stood near his grandfather's chair, sat stool close him, watching absorbing every word he uttered charmed interest. Once he stood near chair's arm his cheek touched Earl's shoulder, his lordship, detecting general smile, smiled little himself. He knew lookers-on thinking, he felt secret amusement seeing good friends he youngster, might expected share popular opinion him. Mr. Havisham expected arrive afternoon, but, strange say, he late. Such thing really never known happen years he visitor Dorincourt Castle. He late guests point rising go dinner he arrived. When he approached his host, Earl regarded amazement. He looked he hurried agitated; his dry, keen old face actually pale. “I detained,” he said, low voice Earl, “by--an extraordinary event.” It unlike methodic old lawyer agitated anything late, evident he disturbed. At dinner he ate scarcely anything, two three times, he spoken to, he started his thoughts far away. At dessert, Fauntleroy came in, he looked once, nervously uneasily. Fauntleroy noted look wondered it. He Mr. Havisham friendly terms, usually exchanged smiles. The lawyer seemed forgotten smile evening. The fact was, he forgot everything strange painful news he knew he must tell Earl night over--the strange news he knew would terrible shock, would change face everything. As he looked splendid rooms brilliant company,--at people gathered together, he knew, might see bright-haired little fellow near Earl's chair reason,--as he looked proud old man little Lord Fauntleroy smiling his side, he really felt quite shaken, notwithstanding he hardened old lawyer. What blow he must deal them! He exactly know long, superb dinner ended. He sat he dream, several times he saw Earl glance surprise. But last, gentlemen joined ladies drawing-room. They found Fauntleroy sitting sofa Miss Vivian Herbert,--the great beauty last London season; looking pictures, he thanking his companion door opened. “I am ever much obliged kind me!” he saying; “I never party before, I have enjoyed much!” He enjoyed much gentlemen gathered Miss Herbert began talk her, he listened tried understand laughing speeches, his eyelids began droop. They drooped covered his eyes two three times, sound Miss Herbert's low, pretty laugh would bring back, he would open two seconds. He quite sure he going sleep, large, yellow satin cushion behind his head sank it, his eyelids drooped last time. They even quite open when, seemed long time after, one kissed lightly cheek. It Miss Vivian Herbert, going away, she spoke softly. “Good-night, little Lord Fauntleroy,” she said. “Sleep well.” And morning he know he tried open his eyes murmured sleepily, “Good-night--I am so--glad--I saw you--you so--pretty----” He faint recollection hearing gentlemen laugh wondering it. No sooner last guest left room, Mr. Havisham turned his place fire, stepped nearer sofa, he stood looking sleeping occupant. Little Lord Fauntleroy taking his ease luxuriously. One leg crossed swung edge sofa; one arm flung easily his head; warm flush healthful, happy, childish sleep his quiet face; his waving tangle bright hair strayed yellow satin cushion. He made picture well worth looking at. As Mr. Havisham looked it, he put his hand rubbed his shaven chin, harassed countenance. “Well, Havisham,” said Earl's harsh voice behind him. “What it? It evident something happened. What extraordinary event, I may ask?” Mr. Havisham turned sofa, still rubbing his chin. “It bad news,” he answered, “distressing news, lord--the worst news. I sorry bearer it.” The Earl uneasy time evening, he glanced Mr. Havisham, he uneasy he always ill-tempered. “Why look boy!” he exclaimed irritably. “You looking evening if--See now, look boy, Havisham, hang like bird ill-omen! What news Lord Fauntleroy?” “My lord,” said Mr. Havisham, “I waste words. My news everything Lord Fauntleroy. And believe it--it Lord Fauntleroy lies sleeping us, son Captain Errol. And present Lord Fauntleroy son son Bevis, moment lodging-house London.” The Earl clutched arms his chair his hands veins stood upon them; veins stood his forehead too; his fierce old face almost livid. “What mean!” he cried out. “You mad! Whose lie this?” “If lie,” answered Mr. Havisham, “it painfully like truth. A woman came chambers morning. She said son Bevis married her six years ago London. She showed her marriage certificate. They quarrelled year marriage, he paid her keep away him. She son five years old. She American lower classes,--an ignorant person,--and lately she fully understand her son could claim. She consulted lawyer found boy really Lord Fauntleroy heir earldom Dorincourt; she, course, insists his claims acknowledged.” There movement curly head yellow satin cushion. A soft, long, sleepy sigh came parted lips, little boy stirred his sleep, restlessly uneasily. Not his slumber disturbed fact he proved small impostor he Lord Fauntleroy never would Earl Dorincourt. He turned his rosy face side, enable old man stared solemnly see better. The handsome, grim old face ghastly. A bitter smile fixed upon it. “I refuse believe word it,” he said, “if low, scoundrelly piece business becomes quite possible connection name son Bevis. It quite like Bevis. He always disgrace us. Always weak, untruthful, vicious young brute low tastes--my son heir, Bevis, Lord Fauntleroy. The woman ignorant, vulgar person, say?” “I obliged admit she scarcely spell her name,” answered lawyer. “She absolutely uneducated openly mercenary. She cares nothing money. She handsome coarse way, but----” The fastidious old lawyer ceased speaking gave sort shudder. The veins old Earl's forehead stood like purple cords. Something else stood upon too--cold drops moisture. He took his handkerchief swept away. His smile grew even bitter. “And I,” he said, “I objected to--to woman, mother child” (pointing sleeping form sofa); “I refused recognize her. And yet she could spell her name. I suppose retribution.” Suddenly he sprang his chair began walk room. Fierce terrible words poured forth his lips. His rage hatred cruel disappointment shook storm shakes tree. His violence something dreadful see, yet Mr. Havisham noticed worst his wrath he never seemed forget little sleeping figure yellow satin cushion, he never spoke loud enough awaken it. “I might known it,” he said. “They disgrace first hour! I hated both; hated me! Bevis worse two. I believe yet, though! I contend last. But like Bevis--it like him!” And he raged asked questions woman, her proofs, pacing room, turned first white purple his repressed fury. When last he learned told, knew worst, Mr. Havisham looked feeling anxiety. He looked broken haggard changed. His rages always bad him, one worse rest something rage it. He came slowly back sofa, last, stood near it. “If one told I could fond child,” he said, his harsh voice low unsteady, “I believed them. I always detested children--my rest. I fond one; he fond me” (with bitter smile). “I popular; I never was. But he fond me. He never afraid me--he always trusted me. He would filled place better I filled it. I know that. He would honor name.” He bent stood minute looking happy, sleeping face. His shaggy eyebrows knitted fiercely, yet somehow he seem fierce all. He put his hand, pushed bright hair back forehead, turned away rang bell. When largest footman appeared, he pointed sofa. “Take”--he said, his voice changed little--“take Lord Fauntleroy his room.” XI When Mr. Hobbs's young friend left go Dorincourt Castle become Lord Fauntleroy, grocery-man time realize Atlantic Ocean lay small companion spent many agreeable hours his society, he really began feel lonely indeed. The fact was, Mr. Hobbs clever man even bright one; he was, indeed, rather slow heavy person, he never made many acquaintances. He mentally energetic enough know amuse himself, truth he never anything entertaining nature read newspapers add his accounts. It easy add his accounts, sometimes took long time bring right; old days, little Lord Fauntleroy, learned add quite nicely his fingers slate pencil, sometimes even gone length trying help him; and, too, he good listener taken interest newspaper said, he Mr. Hobbs held long conversations Revolution British elections Republican party, wonder his going left blank grocery store. At first seemed Mr. Hobbs Cedric really far away, would come back again; day he would look his paper see little lad standing door-way, his white suit red stockings, his straw hat back his head, would hear say his cheerful little voice: “Hello, Mr. Hobbs! This hot day--is not it?” But days passed happen, Mr. Hobbs felt dull uneasy. He even enjoy his newspaper much he used to. He would put paper his knee reading it, sit stare high stool long time. There marks long legs made feel quite dejected melancholy. They marks made heels next Earl Dorincourt, he kicked talked time. It seems even youthful earls kick legs things sit on;--noble blood lofty lineage prevent it. After looking marks, Mr. Hobbs would take his gold watch open stare inscription: “From his oldest friend, Lord Fauntleroy, Mr. Hobbs. When see, remember me.” And staring awhile, he would shut loud snap, sigh get go stand door-way--between box potatoes barrel apples--and look street. At night, store closed, he would light his pipe walk slowly along pavement he reached house Cedric lived, sign read, “This House Let”; he would stop near look shake his head, puff his pipe hard, walk mournfully back again. This went two three weeks new idea came him. Being slow ponderous, always took long time reach new idea. As rule, he like new ideas, preferred old ones. After two three weeks, however, which, instead getting better, matters really grew worse, novel plan slowly deliberately dawned upon him. He would go see Dick. He smoked great many pipes he arrived conclusion, finally he arrive it. He would go see Dick. He knew Dick. Cedric told him, his idea perhaps Dick might comfort way talking things over. So one day Dick hard work blacking customer's boots, short, stout man heavy face bald head stopped pavement stared two three minutes bootblack's sign, read: “PROFESSOR DICK TIPTON CANNOT BE BEAT.” He stared long Dick began take lively interest him, he put finishing touch his customer's boots, he said: “Want shine, sir?” The stout man came forward deliberately put his foot rest. “Yes,” he said. Then Dick fell work, stout man looked Dick sign sign Dick. “Where get that?” he asked. “From friend mine,” said Dick,--“a little feller. He guv' whole outfit. He best little feller ye ever saw. He is England now. Gone one lords.” “Lord--Lord--” asked Mr. Hobbs, ponderous slowness, “Lord Fauntleroy--Going Earl Dorincourt?” Dick almost dropped his brush. “Why, boss!” he exclaimed, “d' ye know yerself?” “I have known him,” answered Mr. Hobbs, wiping his warm forehead, “ever since he born. We lifetime acquaintances--that is WE was.” It really made feel quite agitated speak it. He pulled splendid gold watch his pocket opened it, showed inside case Dick. “'When see, remember me,'” he read. “That his parting keepsake me. 'I do not want forget me'--those his words--I would ha' remembered him,” he went on, shaking his head, “if he had not given thing an' I had not seen hide hair again. He companion ANY man would remember.” “He nicest little feller I ever see,” said Dick. “An' sand--I never seen much sand little feller. I thought heap him, I did,--an' friends, too--we sort chums fust, little young un an' me. I grabbed his ball stage fur him, an' he never forgot it; an' he would come here, he would, his mother his nuss he would holler: 'Hello, Dick!' me, friendly he six feet high, he warn't knee high grasshopper, dressed gal's clo'es. He gay little chap, luck, good talk him.” “That is so,” said Mr. Hobbs. “It pity make earl HIM. He would SHONE grocery business--or dry goods either; he would SHONE!” And he shook his head deeper regret ever. It proved much say possible say one time, agreed next night Dick make visit store keep Mr. Hobbs company. The plan pleased Dick well enough. He street waif nearly his life, he never bad boy, he always private yearning respectable kind existence. Since he business himself, he made enough money enable sleep roof instead streets, he begun hope he might reach even higher plane, time. So, invited call stout, respectable man owned corner store, even horse wagon, seemed quite event. “Do know anything earls castles?” Mr. Hobbs inquired. “I would like know particklars.” “There is story  them Penny Story Gazette,” said Dick. “It is called 'Crime Coronet; or, The Revenge Countess May.' It is boss thing, too. Some us boys  are takin' read.” “Bring come,” said Mr. Hobbs, “an' I will pay it. Bring find earls  them. If are not earls, markises'll do, dooks--though HE never made mention dooks markises. We go coronets little, I never happened see any. I guess do not keep  them 'round here.” “Tiffany  would  them anybody did,” said Dick, “but I do not know I would know one I saw it.” Mr. Hobbs explain he would known one he saw it. He merely shook his head ponderously. “I s'pose little call  them,” he said, ended matter. This beginning quite substantial friendship. When Dick went store, Mr. Hobbs received great hospitality. He gave chair tilted door, near barrel apples, his young visitor seated, he made jerk hand he held his pipe, saying: “Help yerself.” Then he looked story papers, read discussed British aristocracy; Mr. Hobbs smoked his pipe hard shook his head great deal. He shook he pointed high stool marks legs. “There is his kicks,” he said impressively; “his kicks. I sit look  them hour. This world ups an' it is world downs. Why, he would set there, an' eat crackers box, an' apples barrel, an' pitch his cores street; an' he is lord a-livin' castle. Them's lord's kicks; they will earl's kicks day. Sometimes I says myself, says I, 'Well, I will jiggered!'” He seemed derive great deal comfort his reflections Dick's visit. Before Dick went home, supper small back-room; crackers cheese sardines, canned things store, Mr. Hobbs solemnly opened two bottles ginger ale, pouring two glasses, proposed toast. “Here is HIM!” he said, lifting his glass, “an' may he teach  them lesson--earls an' markises an' dooks an' all!” After night, two saw often, Mr. Hobbs much comfortable less desolate. They read Penny Story Gazette, many interesting things, gained knowledge habits nobility gentry would surprised despised classes realized it. One day Mr. Hobbs made pilgrimage book store town, express purpose adding library. He went clerk leaned counter speak him. “I want,” he said, “a book earls.” “What!” exclaimed clerk. “A book,” repeated grocery-man, “about earls.” “I am afraid,” said clerk, looking rather queer, “that have not want.” “Have not?” said Mr. Hobbs, anxiously. “Well, say markises then--or dooks.” “I know book,” answered clerk. Mr. Hobbs much disturbed. He looked floor,--then he looked up. “None female earls?” he inquired. “I am afraid not,” said clerk smile. “Well,” exclaimed Mr. Hobbs, “I will jiggered!” He going store, clerk called back asked story nobility chief characters would do. Mr. Hobbs said would--if he could get entire volume devoted earls. So clerk sold book called “The Tower London,” written Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, he carried home. When Dick came began read it. It wonderful exciting book, scene laid reign famous English queen called people Bloody Mary. And Mr. Hobbs heard Queen Mary's deeds habit she chopping people's heads off, putting torture, burning alive, he became much excited. He took his pipe his mouth stared Dick, last he obliged mop perspiration his brow his red pocket handkerchief. “Why, he are not safe!” he said. “He are not safe! If women folks sit thrones an' give word things like done, who is know what is happening minute? He is safe nothing! Just let woman like get mad, an' one's safe!” “Well,” said Dick, though he looked rather anxious himself; “ye see 'ere un is not one that is bossin' things now. I know her name's Victory, an' un book, her name's Mary.” “So is,” said Mr. Hobbs, still mopping his forehead; “so is. An' newspapers sayin' anything racks, thumb-screws, stake-burnin's,--but still does not seem 't safe queer folks. Why, tell do not keep Fourth July!” He privately uneasy several days; he received Fauntleroy's letter read several times, Dick, also read letter Dick got time, he became composed again. But found great pleasure letters. They read re-read them, talked enjoyed every word them. And spent days answers sent read almost often letters received. It rather labor Dick write his. All his knowledge reading writing he gained months, he lived his elder brother, gone night-school; but, sharp boy, he made brief education, spelled things newspapers since then, practiced writing bits chalk pavements walls fences. He told Mr. Hobbs his life his elder brother, rather good mother died, Dick quite little fellow. Their father died time before. The brother's name Ben, he taken care Dick well he could, boy old enough sell newspapers run errands. They lived together, he grew older Ben managed get along he quite decent place store. “And then,” exclaimed Dick disgust, “blest he did not go an' marry gal! Just went got spoony an' had not sense left! Married her, an' set housekeepin' two back rooms. An' hefty un she was,--a regular tiger-cat. She would tear things pieces she got mad,--and she mad ALL time. Had baby like her,--yell day 'n' night! An' I did not 'tend it! an' screamed, she would fire things me. She fired plate one day, an' hit baby-- cut chin. Doctor said he would carry mark till he died. A nice mother she was! Crackey! did not time--Ben 'n' mehself 'n' young un. She mad Ben he did not make money faster; 'n' last he went West man set cattle ranch. An' had not gone week 'fore one night, I got home sellin' papers, 'n' rooms wus locked 'n' empty, 'n' woman house, she told Minna  would gone--shown clean pair heels. Some un else said she would gone across water nuss lady little baby, too. Never heard word her since--nuther Ben. If I would ha' bin him, I would not ha' fretted bit--'n' I guess he did not. But he thought heap her start. Tell you, he spoons her. She daisy-lookin' gal, too, she dressed 'n' mad. She would big black eyes 'n' black hair her knees; she would make rope big arm, twist 'round 'n' 'round her head; 'n' I tell her eyes  would snap! Folks used say she part _I_tali-un--said her mother father  would come there, 'n' made her queer. I tell ye, she one  them--she was!” He often told Mr. Hobbs stories her his brother Ben, who, since his going West, written twice Dick. Ben's luck good, he wandered place place; last he settled ranch California, he work time Dick became acquainted Mr. Hobbs. “That gal,” said Dick one day, “she took grit him. I could not help feelin' sorry sometimes.” They sitting store door-way together, Mr. Hobbs filling his pipe. “He ought not 've married,” he said solemnly, he rose get match. “Women--I never could see use  them myself.” As he took match box, he stopped looked counter. “Why!” he said, “if is not letter! I did not see before. The postman must laid I was not noticin', newspaper slipped it.” He picked looked carefully. “It is HIM!” he exclaimed. “That is one it is from!” He forgot his pipe altogether. He went back his chair quite excited took his pocket-knife opened envelope. “I wonder news time,” he said. And he unfolded letter read follows: “DORINCOURT CASTLE” My dear Mr. Hobbs “I write great hury becaus something curous tell know mutch suprised dear frend tel you. It mistake lord shall earl lady whitch marid uncle bevis dead she little boy he lord fauntleroy becaus way England earls eldest sons little boy earl every body else dead mean his farther grandfarther dead grandfarther dead uncle bevis his boy lord Fauntleroy becaus papa youngest son name Cedric Errol like New York things belong boy thought first give pony cart grandfarther says need grandfarther sorry think he like lady preaps he thinks dearest sorry shall earl would like earl better thout would first becaus beautifle castle like every body rich many things rich becaus papa youngest son he rich going learn work take care dearest asking Wilkins grooming horses preaps might groom coachman.

It always his habit say, “I WILL jiggered,” time he said, “I AM jiggered.” Perhaps he really WAS jiggered. There knowing. “Well,” said Dick, “the whole thing's bust up, has not it?” “Bust!” said Mr. Hobbs. “It is opinion it is put-up job British ristycrats rob his rights he is American. They have spite agin us ever since Revolution, an' they are takin' him. I told he was not safe, an' see what is happened! Like not, whole gover'ment's got together rob his lawful ownin's.” He much agitated. He approved change his young friend's circumstances first, lately he become reconciled it, receipt Cedric's letter he perhaps even felt secret pride his young friend's magnificence. He might good opinion earls, he knew even America money considered rather agreeable thing, wealth grandeur go title, must rather hard lose it. “They are trying rob him!” he said, “that is they are doing, folks money ought look him.” And he kept Dick quite late hour talk over, young man left, he went corner street; his way back he stopped opposite empty house time, staring “To Let,” smoking his pipe, much disturbance mind. XII A days dinner party Castle, almost everybody England read newspapers knew romantic story happened Dorincourt. It made interesting story told details. There little American boy brought England Lord Fauntleroy, said fine handsome little fellow, already made people fond him; old Earl, his grandfather, proud his heir; pretty young mother never forgiven marrying Captain Errol; strange marriage Bevis, dead Lord Fauntleroy, strange wife, one knew anything, suddenly appearing her son, saying he real Lord Fauntleroy must his rights. All things talked written about, caused tremendous sensation. And came rumor Earl Dorincourt satisfied turn affairs taken, would perhaps contest claim law, matter might end wonderful trial. There never excitement county Erleboro situated. On market-days, people stood groups talked wondered would done; farmers' wives invited one another tea might tell one another heard thought thought people thought. They related wonderful anecdotes Earl's rage his determination acknowledge new Lord Fauntleroy, his hatred woman claimant's mother. But, course, Mrs. Dibble could tell most, demand ever. “An' bad lookout is,” she said. “An' ask me, madam, I say judgment way he is treated sweet young cre'tur' he parted her child,--for he is got fond an' set an' proud he is a'most drove mad what is happened. An' what is more, new one's lady, his little lordship's is. She is bold-faced, black-eyed thing, Mr. Thomas says gentleman livery 'you'd bemean hisself gave orders by; let her come house, he says, an' he goes it. An' boy do not compare one nothing could mention. An' mercy knows what is going come all, an' it is end, an' might knocked feather Jane brought news.” In fact excitement everywhere Castle: library, Earl Mr. Havisham sat talked; servants' hall, Mr. Thomas butler men women servants gossiped exclaimed times day; stables, Wilkins went his work quite depressed state mind, groomed brown pony beautifully ever, said mournfully coachman he “never taught young gen'leman ride took nat'ral, better-plucked one he was. He one pleasure ride behind.” But midst disturbance one person quite calm untroubled. That person little Lord Fauntleroy said Lord Fauntleroy all. When first state affairs explained him, he felt little anxiousness perplexity, true, foundation baffled ambition. While Earl told happened, he sat stool holding his knee, he often he listening anything interesting; time story finished he looked quite sober. “It makes feel queer,” he said; “it makes feel--queer!” The Earl looked boy silence. It made feel queer, too--queerer he ever felt his whole life. And he felt queer still he saw troubled expression small face usually happy. “Will take Dearest's house her--and her carriage?” Cedric asked rather unsteady, anxious little voice. “NO!” said Earl decidedly--in quite loud voice, fact. “They take nothing her.” “Ah!” said Cedric, evident relief. “Cannot they?” Then he looked his grandfather, wistful shade his eyes, looked big soft. “That boy,” he said rather tremulously--“he to--to boy now--as I was--will not he?” “NO!” answered Earl--and he said fiercely loudly Cedric quite jumped. “No?” he exclaimed, wonderment. “Will not he? I thought----” He stood his stool quite suddenly. “Shall I boy, even I am going earl?” he said. “Shall I boy, I before?” And his flushed little face alight eagerness. How old Earl look head foot, sure! How his great shaggy brows draw together, queerly his deep eyes shone them--how queerly! “My boy!” he said--and, you will believe it, his voice queer, almost shaky little broken hoarse, would expect Earl's voice be, though he spoke decidedly peremptorily even before,--“Yes, you will boy long I live; and, George, sometimes I feel boy I ever had.” Cedric's face turned red roots his hair; turned red relief pleasure. He put his hands deep his pockets looked squarely his noble relative's eyes. “Do you?” he said. “Well, then, I do not care earl part all. I do not care whether I am earl not. I thought--you see, I thought one going Earl would boy, too, and--and I could not be. That made feel queer.” The Earl put his hand his shoulder drew nearer. “They shall take nothing I hold you,” he said, drawing his breath hard. “I will not believe yet take anything you. You made place, and--well, may fill still. But whatever comes, shall I give you--all!” It scarcely seemed he speaking child, determination his face voice; he making promise himself--and perhaps he was. He never known deep hold upon his fondness boy his pride taken. He never seen his strength good qualities beauty he seemed see now. To his obstinate nature seemed impossible--more impossible--to give he set his heart upon. And he determined he would give without fierce struggle. Within days she seen Mr. Havisham, woman claimed Lady Fauntleroy presented herself Castle, brought her child her. She sent away. The Earl would see her, she told footman door; his lawyer would attend her case. It Thomas gave message, expressed his opinion her freely afterward, servants' hall. He “hoped,” he said, “as he wore livery 'igh famblies long enough know lady he see one, an' lady he judge females.” “The one Lodge,” added Thomas loftily, “'Merican 'Merican, she is one right sort, gentleman 'you'd reckinize heye. I remarked Henery fust called there.” The woman drove away; look her handsome, common face half frightened, half fierce. Mr. Havisham noticed, his interviews her, though she passionate temper, coarse, insolent manner, she neither clever bold she meant be; she seemed sometimes almost overwhelmed position she placed herself. It she expected meet opposition. “She evidently,” lawyer said Mrs. Errol, “a person lower walks life. She uneducated untrained everything, quite unused meeting people like terms equality. She know do. Her visit Castle quite cowed her. She infuriated, she cowed. The Earl would receive her, I advised go Dorincourt Arms, she staying. When she saw enter room, she turned white, though she flew rage once, threatened demanded one breath.” The fact Earl stalked room stood, looking like venerable aristocratic giant, staring woman his beetling brows, condescending word. He simply stared her, taking her head foot she repulsive curiosity. He let her talk demand she tired, without uttering word, he said: “You say eldest son's wife. If true, proof offer much us, law side. In case, boy Lord Fauntleroy. The matter sifted bottom, may rest assured. If claims proved, provided for. I want see nothing either child long I live. The place unfortunately enough death. You exactly kind person I expected son Bevis choose.” And he turned his back upon her stalked room he stalked it. Not many days that, visitor announced Mrs. Errol, writing her little morning room. The maid, brought message, looked rather excited; her eyes quite round amazement, fact, young inexperienced, she regarded her mistress nervous sympathy. “It is Earl hisself, madam!” she said tremulous awe. When Mrs. Errol entered drawing-room, tall, majestic-looking old man standing tiger-skin rug. He handsome, grim old face, aquiline profile, long white mustache, obstinate look. “Mrs. Errol, I believe?” he said. “Mrs. Errol,” she answered. “I Earl Dorincourt,” he said. He paused moment, almost unconsciously, look her uplifted eyes. They like big, affectionate, childish eyes he seen uplifted his often every day last months, gave quite curious sensation. “The boy like you,” he said abruptly. “It often said so, lord,” she replied, “but I glad think like his father also.” As Lady Lorridaile told him, her voice sweet, her manner simple dignified. She seem least troubled his sudden coming. “Yes,” said Earl, “he like--my son--too.” He put his hand his big white mustache pulled fiercely. “Do know,” he said, “why I come here?” “I seen Mr. Havisham,” Mrs. Errol began, “and he told claims made----” “I come tell you,” said Earl, “that investigated contested, contest made. I come tell boy shall defended power law. His rights----” The soft voice interrupted him. “He must nothing NOT his right, even law give him,” she said. “Unfortunately law not,” said Earl. “If could, should. This outrageous woman her child----” “Perhaps she cares much I care Cedric, lord,” said little Mrs. Errol. “And she eldest son's wife, her son Lord Fauntleroy, mine not.” She afraid Cedric been, she looked Cedric would looked, he, old tyrant his life, privately pleased it. People seldom dared differ entertaining novelty it. “I suppose,” he said, scowling slightly, “that would much prefer he Earl Dorincourt.” Her fair young face flushed. “It magnificent thing Earl Dorincourt, lord,” she said. “I know that, I care he his father was--brave true always.” “In striking contrast his grandfather was, eh?” said his lordship sardonically. “I pleasure knowing his grandfather,” replied Mrs. Errol, “but I know little boy believes----” She stopped short moment, looking quietly his face, she added, “I know Cedric loves you.” “Would he loved me,” said Earl dryly, “if told I receive Castle?” “No,” answered Mrs. Errol, “I think not. That I wish know.” “Well,” said lord brusquely, “there women would told him.” He suddenly began walk room, pulling his great mustache violently ever. “Yes, he fond me,” he said, “and I fond him. I cannot say I ever fond anything before. I fond him. He pleased first. I old man, tired life. He given something live for. I proud him. I satisfied think his taking his place day head family.” He came back stood Mrs. Errol. “I miserable,” he said. “Miserable!” He looked he was. Even his pride could keep his voice steady his hands shaking. For moment almost seemed his deep, fierce eyes tears them. “Perhaps I miserable I come you,” he said, quite glaring her. “I used hate you; I jealous you. This wretched, disgraceful business changed that. After seeing repulsive woman calls herself wife son Bevis, I actually felt would relief look you. I obstinate old fool, I suppose I treated badly. You like boy, boy first object life. I miserable, I came merely like boy, he cares you, I care him. Treat well can, boy's sake.” He said his harsh voice, almost roughly, somehow he seemed broken time Mrs. Errol touched heart. She got moved arm-chair little forward. “I wish would sit down,” she said soft, pretty, sympathetic way. “You much troubled tired, need strength.” It new spoken cared gentle, simple way contradicted. He reminded “the boy” again, he actually she asked him. Perhaps his disappointment wretchedness good discipline him; he wretched he might continued hate her, present he found her little soothing. Almost anything would seemed pleasant contrast Lady Fauntleroy; one sweet face voice, pretty dignity she spoke moved. Very soon, quiet magic influences, he began feel less gloomy, he talked still more. “Whatever happens,” he said, “the boy shall provided for. He shall taken care of, future.” Before he went away, he glanced around room. “Do like house?” he demanded. “Very much,” she answered. “This cheerful room,” he said. “May I come talk matter over?” “As often wish, lord,” she replied. And he went his carriage drove away, Thomas Henry almost stricken dumb upon box turn affairs taken. XIII OF course, soon story Lord Fauntleroy difficulties Earl Dorincourt discussed English newspapers, discussed American newspapers. The story interesting passed lightly, talked great deal. There many versions would edifying thing buy papers compare them. Mr. Hobbs read much he became quite bewildered. One paper described his young friend Cedric infant arms,--another young man Oxford, winning honors, distinguishing writing Greek poems; one said he engaged young lady great beauty, daughter duke; another said he married; thing, fact, NOT said he little boy seven eight, handsome legs curly hair. One said he relation Earl Dorincourt all, small impostor sold newspapers slept streets New York his mother imposed upon family lawyer, came America look Earl's heir. Then came descriptions new Lord Fauntleroy his mother. Sometimes she gypsy, sometimes actress, sometimes beautiful Spaniard; always agreed Earl Dorincourt her deadly enemy, would acknowledge her son his heir he could help it, seemed slight flaw papers she produced, expected would long trial, would far interesting anything ever carried court before. Mr. Hobbs used read papers his head whirl, evening he Dick would talk over. They found important personage Earl Dorincourt was, magnificent income he possessed, many estates he owned, stately beautiful Castle he lived; learned, excited became. “Seems like something orter done,” said Mr. Hobbs. “Things like orter held to--earls earls.” But really nothing could write letter Cedric, containing assurances friendship sympathy. They wrote letters soon could receiving news; written them, handed read. This Mr. Hobbs read Dick's letter: “DERE FREND: got ure letter Mr. Hobbs got his sory ure luck say hold longs kin do not let one git ahed you. There lot ole theves wil make al kin ef do not kepe ure skined. But mosly say i have forgot wot fur are not better way cum go pardners me. Biznes fine ile see harm cums Enny big feler trise cum wil hafter setle fust Perfessor Dick Tipton. So present “DICK.” And Dick read Mr. Hobbs's letter: “DEAR SIR: Yrs received wd say things looks bad. I believe put job that is done ought looked sharp. And I write say two things. I Am going look thing up. Keep quiet Ill see lawyer I And worst happens earls many us there is partnership grocery business ready yure old enough home friend “Yrs truly, “SILAS HOBBS.” “Well,” said Mr. Hobbs, “he is pervided us, he are not earl.” “So he is,” said Dick. “I would ha' stood him. Blest I did not like little feller fust-rate.” The next morning, one Dick's customers rather surprised. He young lawyer beginning practice--as poor young lawyer possibly be, bright, energetic young fellow, sharp wit good temper. He shabby office near Dick's stand, every morning Dick blacked his boots him, quite often exactly water-tight, he always friendly word joke Dick. That particular morning, he put his foot rest, he illustrated paper his hand--an enterprising paper, pictures conspicuous people things. He finished looking over, last boot polished, he handed boy. “Here is paper you, Dick,” he said; “you look drop Delmonico's breakfast. Picture English castle it, English earl's daughter-in-law. Fine young woman, too,--lots hair,--though she seems raising rather row. You ought become familiar nobility gentry, Dick. Begin Right Honorable Earl Dorincourt Lady Fauntleroy. Hello! I say, what is matter?” The pictures he spoke front page, Dick staring one his eyes mouth open, his sharp face almost pale excitement. “What is pay, Dick?” said young man. “What paralyzed you?” Dick really look something tremendous happened. He pointed picture, written: “Mother Claimant (Lady Fauntleroy).” It picture handsome woman, large eyes heavy braids black hair wound around her head. “Her!” said Dick. “My, I know her better 'n I know you!” The young man began laugh. “Where meet her, Dick?” he said. “At Newport? Or ran Paris last time?” Dick actually forgot grin. He began gather his brushes things together, he something would put end his business present. “Never mind,” he said. “I know her! An I have struck work mornin'.” And less five minutes time he tearing streets his way Mr. Hobbs corner store. Mr. Hobbs could scarcely believe evidence his senses he looked across counter saw Dick rush paper his hand. The boy breath running; much breath, fact, he could scarcely speak he threw paper counter. “Hello!” exclaimed Mr. Hobbs. “Hello! What got there?” “Look it!” panted Dick. “Look woman picture! That is look at! SHE are not 'ristocrat, SHE are not!” withering scorn. “She is lord's wife. You may eat me, are not Minna--MINNA! I would know her anywheres, an'  would Ben. Jest ax him.” Mr. Hobbs dropped his seat. “I knowed put-up job,” he said. “I knowed it; done account bein' 'Merican!” “Done it!” cried Dick, disgust. “SHE done it, that is done it. She allers her tricks; an' I will tell yer wot come me, minnit I saw her pictur. There one papers saw letter said something 'bout her boy, an' said he scar his chin. Put two together--her 'n' scar! Why, boy are not lord I am! It is BEN'S boy,--the little chap she hit she let fly plate me.” Professor Dick Tipton always sharp boy, earning his living streets big city made still sharper. He learned keep his eyes open his wits him, must confessed he enjoyed immensely excitement impatience moment. If little Lord Fauntleroy could looked store morning, he would certainly interested, even discussion plans intended decide fate boy himself. Mr. Hobbs almost overwhelmed his sense responsibility, Dick alive full energy. He began write letter Ben, he cut picture inclosed him, Mr. Hobbs wrote letter Cedric one Earl. They midst letter-writing new idea came Dick. “Say,” he said, “the feller give paper, he is lawyer. Let us ax we would better do. Lawyers knows all.” Mr. Hobbs immensely impressed suggestion Dick's business capacity. “That is so!” he replied. “This calls lawyers.” And leaving store care substitute, he struggled his coat marched down-town Dick, two presented romantic story Mr. Harrison's office, much young man's astonishment. If he young lawyer, enterprising mind great deal spare time his hands, he might readily interested say, certainly sounded wild queer; he chanced want something much, he chanced know Dick, Dick chanced say his say sharp, telling sort way. “And,” said Mr. Hobbs, “say time's worth a' hour look thing thorough, I WILL pay damage,--Silas Hobbs, corner Blank street, Vegetables Fancy Groceries.” “Well,” said Mr. Harrison, “it big thing turns right, almost big thing Lord Fauntleroy; and, rate, harm done investigating. It appears dubiousness child. The woman contradicted herself her statements his age, aroused suspicion. The first persons written Dick's brother Earl Dorincourt's family lawyer.” And actually, sun went down, two letters written sent two different directions--one speeding New York harbor mail steamer way England, train carrying letters passengers bound California. And first addressed T. Havisham, Esq., second Benjamin Tipton. And store closed evening, Mr. Hobbs Dick sat back-room talked together midnight. XIV It astonishing short time takes wonderful things happen. It taken minutes, apparently, change fortunes little boy dangling his red legs high stool Mr. Hobbs's store, transform small boy, living simplest life quiet street, English nobleman, heir earldom magnificent wealth. It taken minutes, apparently, change English nobleman penniless little impostor, right splendors he enjoying. And, surprising may appear, take nearly long time one might expected, alter face everything give back he danger losing. It took less time because, all, woman called herself Lady Fauntleroy nearly clever she wicked; she closely pressed Mr. Havisham's questions her marriage her boy, she made one two blunders caused suspicion awakened; she lost her presence mind her temper, her excitement anger betrayed herself still further. All mistakes she made her child. There seemed doubt she married Bevis, Lord Fauntleroy, quarreled paid keep away him; Mr. Havisham found her story boy's born certain part London false; midst commotion caused discovery, came letter young lawyer New York, Mr. Hobbs's letters also. What evening letters arrived, Mr. Havisham Earl sat talked plans library! “After first three meetings her,” said Mr. Havisham, “I began suspect her strongly. It appeared child older she said he was, she made slip speaking date his birth tried patch matter up. The story letters bring fits several suspicions. Our best plan cable two Tiptons,--say nothing her,--and suddenly confront her she expecting it. She clumsy plotter, all. My opinion she frightened her wits, betray herself spot.” And actually happened. She told nothing, Mr. Havisham kept her suspecting anything continuing interviews her, he assured her he investigating her statements; she really began feel secure her spirits rose immensely she began insolent might expected. But one fine morning, she sat her sitting-room inn called “The Dorincourt Arms,” making fine plans herself, Mr. Havisham announced; he entered, he followed less three persons--one sharp-faced boy one big young man third Earl Dorincourt. She sprang her feet actually uttered cry terror. It broke her she time check it. She thought new-comers thousands miles away, she ever thought all, she scarcely done years. She never expected see again. It must confessed Dick grinned little he saw her. “Hello, Minna!” he said. The big young man--who Ben--stood still minute looked her. “Do know her?” Mr. Havisham asked, glancing one other. “Yes,” said Ben. “I know her she knows me.” And he turned his back her went stood looking window, sight her hateful him, indeed was. Then woman, seeing herself baffled exposed, lost control herself flew rage Ben Dick often seen her before. Dick grinned trifle he watched her heard names she called violent threats she made, Ben turn look her. “I swear her court,” he said Mr. Havisham, “and I bring dozen others will. Her father respectable sort man, though he is low world. Her mother like herself. She is dead, he is alive, he is honest enough ashamed her. He will tell she is, whether she married not.” Then he clenched his hand suddenly turned her. “Where is child?” he demanded. “He is going me! He done you, I!” And he finished saying words, door leading bedroom opened little, boy, probably attracted sound loud voices, looked in. He handsome boy, he rather nice face, he quite like Ben, his father, one could see, three-cornered scar his chin. Ben walked took his hand, his trembling. “Yes,” he said, “I could swear him, too. Tom,” he said little fellow, “I am father; I have come take away. Where is hat?” The boy pointed lay chair. It evidently rather pleased hear he going away. He accustomed queer experiences surprise told stranger he his father. He objected much woman come months place he lived since his babyhood, suddenly announced she his mother, he quite ready change. Ben took hat marched door. “If want again,” he said Mr. Havisham, “you know find me.” He walked room, holding child's hand looking woman once. She fairly raving fury, Earl calmly gazing her his eyeglasses, he quietly placed upon his aristocratic, eagle nose. “Come, come, young woman,” said Mr. Havisham. “This will not all. If do not want locked up, really must behave yourself.” And something business-like his tones that, probably feeling safest thing she could would get way, she gave one savage look dashed past next room slammed door. “We shall trouble her,” said Mr. Havisham. And he right; night she left Dorincourt Arms took train London, seen more. When Earl left room interview, he went his carriage. “To Court Lodge,” he said Thomas. “To Court Lodge,” said Thomas coachman he mounted box; “an' may depend it, things taking uniggspected turn.” When carriage stopped Court Lodge, Cedric drawing-room his mother. The Earl came without announced. He looked inch taller, great many years younger. His deep eyes flashed. “Where,” he said, “is Lord Fauntleroy?” Mrs. Errol came forward, flush rising her cheek. “Is Lord Fauntleroy?” she asked. “Is it, indeed!” The Earl put his hand grasped hers. “Yes,” he answered, “it is.” Then he put his hand Cedric's shoulder. “Fauntleroy,” he said his unceremonious, authoritative way, “ask mother she come us Castle.” Fauntleroy flung his arms around his mother's neck. “To live us!” he cried. “To live us always!” The Earl looked Mrs. Errol, Mrs. Errol looked Earl. His lordship entirely earnest. He made his mind waste time arranging matter. He begun think would suit make friends his heir's mother. “Are quite sure want me?” said Mrs. Errol, her soft, pretty smile. “Quite sure,” he said bluntly. “We always wanted you, exactly aware it. We hope come.” XV Ben took his boy went back his cattle ranch California, he returned comfortable circumstances. Just his going, Mr. Havisham interview lawyer told Earl Dorincourt wished something boy might turned Lord Fauntleroy, he decided would good plan invest cattle ranch his own, put Ben charge terms would make pay well, would lay foundation his son's future. And Ben went away, he went prospective master ranch would almost good his own, might easily become his time, indeed course years; Tom, boy, grew fine young man devotedly fond his father; successful happy Ben used say Tom made troubles he ever had. But Dick Mr. Hobbs--who actually come others see things properly looked after--did return time. It decided outset Earl would provide Dick, would see he received solid education; Mr. Hobbs decided he left reliable substitute charge his store, he could afford wait see festivities celebrate Lord Fauntleroy's eighth birthday. All tenantry invited, feasting dancing games park, bonfires fire-works evening. “Just like Fourth July!” said Lord Fauntleroy. “It seems pity birthday was not Fourth, does not it? For could keep together.” It must confessed first Earl Mr. Hobbs intimate might hoped would become, interests British aristocracy. The fact Earl known grocery-men, Mr. Hobbs many close acquaintances earls; rare interviews conversation flourish. It must also owned Mr. Hobbs rather overwhelmed splendors Fauntleroy felt his duty show him. The entrance gate stone lions avenue impressed Mr. Hobbs somewhat beginning, he saw Castle, flower-gardens, hot-houses, terraces, peacocks, dungeon, armor, great staircase, stables, liveried servants, he really quite bewildered. But picture gallery seemed finishing stroke. “Something manner museum?” he said Fauntleroy, he led great, beautiful room. “N--no--!” said Fauntleroy, rather doubtfully. “I do not THINK it is museum. My grandfather says ancestors.” “Your aunt's sisters!” ejaculated Mr. Hobbs. “ALL  them? Your great-uncle, he MUST family! Did he raise  them all?” And he sank seat looked around quite agitated countenance, greatest difficulty Lord Fauntleroy managed explain walls lined entirely portraits progeny his great-uncle. He found necessary, fact, call assistance Mrs. Mellon, knew pictures, could tell painted when, added romantic stories lords ladies originals. When Mr. Hobbs understood, heard stories, he much fascinated liked picture gallery almost better anything else; he would often walk village, he staid Dorincourt Arms, would spend half hour wandering gallery, staring painted ladies gentlemen, also stared him, shaking his head nearly time. “And earls!” he would say, “er pretty nigh it! An' HE IS going one  them, an' all!” Privately he nearly much disgusted earls mode life he expected be, doubted whether his strictly republican principles shaken little closer acquaintance castles ancestors rest it. At rate, one day he uttered remarkable unexpected sentiment: “I would not minded bein' one  them myself!” he said--which really great concession. What grand day little Lord Fauntleroy's birthday arrived, his young lordship enjoyed it! How beautiful park looked, filled thronging people dressed gayest best, flags flying tents top Castle! Nobody staid away could possibly come, everybody really glad little Lord Fauntleroy little Lord Fauntleroy still, day master everything. Every one wanted look him, his pretty, kind mother, made many friends. And positively every one liked Earl rather better, felt amiably toward little boy loved trusted so, because, also, he made friends behaved respectfully his heir's mother. It said he even beginning fond her, too, his young lordship his young lordship's mother, Earl might changed time quite well-behaved old nobleman, everybody might happier better off. What scores scores people trees, tents, lawns! Farmers farmers' wives Sunday suits bonnets shawls; girls sweethearts; children frolicking chasing about; old dames red cloaks gossiping together. At Castle, ladies gentlemen come see fun, congratulate Earl, meet Mrs. Errol. Lady Lorredaile Sir Harry there, Sir Thomas Asshe his daughters, Mr. Havisham, course, beautiful Miss Vivian Herbert, loveliest white gown lace parasol, circle gentlemen take care her--though she evidently liked Fauntleroy better put together. And he saw her ran her put his arm around her neck, she put her arms around him, too, kissed warmly he her favorite little brother, she said: “Dear little Lord Fauntleroy! dear little boy! I glad! I glad!” And afterward she walked grounds him, let show her everything. And he took her Mr. Hobbs Dick were, said her, “This old, old friend Mr. Hobbs, Miss Herbert, old friend Dick. I told pretty were, I told see came birthday,”--she shook hands both, stood talked her prettiest way, asking America voyage life since England; Fauntleroy stood by, looking her adoring eyes, his cheeks quite flushed delight he saw Mr. Hobbs Dick liked her much. “Well,” said Dick solemnly, afterward, “she is daisiest gal I ever saw! She is--well, she is daisy, that is she is, 'n' mistake!” Everybody looked her she passed, every one looked little Lord Fauntleroy. And sun shone flags fluttered games played dances danced, gayeties went joyous afternoon passed, his little lordship simply radiantly happy. The whole world seemed beautiful him. There one else happy, too,--an old man, who, though he rich noble his life, often honestly happy. Perhaps, indeed, I shall tell I think he rather better he he rather happier. He not, indeed, suddenly become good Fauntleroy thought him; but, least, he begun love something, he several times found sort pleasure kind things innocent, kind little heart child suggested,--and beginning. And every day he pleased his son's wife. It true, people said, he beginning like her too. He liked hear her sweet voice see her sweet face; he sat his arm-chair, he used watch her listen she talked her boy; he heard loving, gentle words new him, he began see little fellow lived New York side street known grocery-men made friends boot-blacks, still well-bred manly little fellow he made one ashamed him, even fortune changed heir English earldom, living English castle. It really simple thing, all,--it he lived near kind gentle heart, taught think kind thoughts always care others. It little thing, perhaps, best thing all. He knew nothing earls castles; he quite ignorant grand splendid things; he always lovable he simple loving. To like born king. As old Earl Dorincourt looked day, moving park among people, talking he knew making his ready little bow one greeted him, entertaining his friends Dick Mr. Hobbs, standing near his mother Miss Herbert listening conversation, old nobleman well satisfied him. And he never better satisfied he went biggest tent, important tenants Dorincourt estate sitting grand collation day. They drinking toasts; and, drunk health Earl, much enthusiasm his name ever greeted before, proposed health “Little Lord Fauntleroy.” And ever doubt whether his lordship popular not, would settled instant. Such clamor voices, rattle glasses applause! They begun like much, warm-hearted people, forgot feel restraint ladies gentlemen castle, come see them. They made quite decent uproar, one two motherly women looked tenderly little fellow he stood, his mother one side Earl other, grew quite moist eyes, said one another: “God bless him, pretty little dear!” Little Lord Fauntleroy delighted. He stood smiled, made bows, flushed rosy red pleasure roots his bright hair. “Is like me, Dearest?” he said his mother. “Is it, Dearest? I am glad!” And Earl put his hand child's shoulder said him: “Fauntleroy, say thank kindness.” Fauntleroy gave glance his mother. “Must I?” he asked trifle shyly, she smiled, Miss Herbert, nodded. And he made little step forward, everybody looked him--such beautiful, innocent little fellow he was, too, his brave, trustful face!--and he spoke loudly he could, his childish voice ringing quite clear strong. “I am ever much obliged you!” he said, “and--I hope you will enjoy birthday--because I have enjoyed much--and--I am glad I am going earl; I did not think first I like it, I do--and I love place so, I think beautiful--and--and--and I earl, I going try good grandfather.” And amid shouts clamor applause, he stepped back little sigh relief, put his hand Earl's stood close him, smiling leaning his side. And would end story; I must add one curious piece information, Mr. Hobbs became fascinated high life reluctant leave his young friend he actually sold his corner store New York, settled English village Erlesboro, he opened shop patronized Castle consequently great success. And though he Earl never became intimate, believe me, man Hobbs became time aristocratic his lordship himself, he read Court news every morning, followed doings House Lords! And ten years after, Dick, finished his education going visit his brother California, asked good grocer he wish return America, he shook his head seriously. “Not live there,” he said. “Not live there; I want near HIM, an' sort look him. It is good enough country that is young an' stirrin'--but there is faults it. There is auntsister among  them--nor earl!”
