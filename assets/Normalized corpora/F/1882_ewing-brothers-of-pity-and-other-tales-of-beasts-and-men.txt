 BROTHERS OF PITY AND OTHER TALES OF BEASTS AND MEN BROTHERS OF PITY. "Who dug his grave?" * * * * * "Who made his shroud?" "I," said Beetle, "With thread needle, I made his shroud."--_Death Cock Robin_. It must much easier play things one. There one me, Nurse care playing things. Sometimes I try persuade her; she good temper she says she got bone her leg, she is not she says little boys cannot amuse it is sure certain sign they have got "the worrits," sooner put bed Gregory's powder "the better every one else." Godfather Gilpin play delightfully he time, he believes fancy things, he busy his books. But even he reading he let put game. He does not mind pretending fancy person he has not anything, I speak he always remembers he is. That I like playing his study better nursery. And Nurse always says "He is safe enough, old gentleman," I am allowed go much I like. Godfather Gilpin let us play books, I always take care them. Besides, nothing else play with, except window-curtains, chairs always full. So I sit floor, sometimes I build books (particularly Stonehenge), sometimes I make people them, call names backs, ones languages call foreigners, Godfather Gilpin tells countries belong to. And sometimes I lie face read (for I could read I four years old), Godfather Gilpin tells hard words. The rule he makes is, I must get books one shelf, easily put away again. I may shelf I like, I must mix shelves up. I always took care books, never accident till day I dropped Jeremy Taylor's _Sermons_. It made miserable, I knew Godfather Gilpin could never trust much again. However, happened, I known anything Brothers Pity; so, perhaps (as Mrs. James, Godfather Gilpin's house-keeper, says), "All's best," "It is ill wind blows nobody good." It happened Sunday, I remember, day day I shelf books alike. They foreigners--Italians--and names _Goldoni_, forty-seven them, white gold. I could read them, lots pictures, I know stories about. So next day, Godfather Gilpin gave leave play Sunday game books, I thought I would English ones, big ones, change, _Goldonis_ rather small. We played church, I parson, Godfather Gilpin old gentleman sits big pew knocker, goes sleep (because he wanted go sleep), books congregation. They big, fat, thin, like real people--not like _Goldonis_, alike. I arranging places looking names, I saw one called Taylor's _Sermons_, I thought I would keep one preach real sermon I read prayers. Of course I responses well "Dearly beloved brethren" things, I sing hymns too, books could anything, Godfather Gilpin asleep. When I finished service I stood behind chair full newspapers, pulpit, I lifted Taylor's _Sermons_, rested chair, began look see I would preach. It old book, bound brown leather, ornamented gold, picture man black gown round black cap white collar beginning; list sermons names texts. I read through, see sounded interesting, I did not care much them. However, last one called "A Funeral Sermon, preached Obsequies Right Honourable Countess Carbery;" I wondered obsequies were, Countess Carbery was, I thought I would preach sermon try find out. There long text, easy one. It was: "For must needs die, water spilt ground, cannot gathered again: neither doth GOD respect person: yet doth He devise means His banished expelled Him." The sermon was not easier text, half _s_'s like _f_'s made rather hard preach, Latin mixed it, I skip. I preached two pages I got middle long sentence, part this: "Every trifling accident discomposes us; face waters wafting storm wrinkles itself, makes upon forehead furrows deep hollow like grave: great little cares trifles first make wrinkles old age, dig grave us." I knew meaning words "wrinkles," "old age." Godfather Gilpin's forehead unusually deep furrows, and, almost will, I turned quickly look his wrinkles like graves churchyard, Taylor's _Sermons_, heavy binding, slipped pulpit fell ground. And Godfather Gilpin woke up, (quite forgetting he really old gentleman pew knocker) said, "Dear me, dear me! Jeremy Taylor knocking like football? My dear child, I cannot lend books play drop floor." I took arms carried sorrowfully Godfather Gilpin. He kind, said hurt, I might go playing others; I could see stroking brown leather gold back, bruised wanted comforting, I far sorry go preaching, even I anything preach. I picked smallest book I could see congregation, sat pretended read. There pictures it, I turned great many, one other, I could see them, eyes full tears mortification regret. The first picture I saw tears dried enough let see curious one indeed. It picture two men carrying looked like another man covered blue quilt, sort bier. But funny part dress men. They wrapped black cloaks, masks faces, underneath picture written, "_Fratelli della Misericordia_"--"Brothers Pity." I know whether accident Jeremy Taylor made Godfather Gilpin anxious his books sleep, I found he keeping awake, bit he said me, "What staring hard quietly at, little Mouse?" I looked back book, called _Religious Orders_; I said, "It is called _Religious Orders_, picture I am looking got two men dressed black, faces covered eyes, carrying another man something blue him." "_Fratelli della Misericordia_," said Godfather Gilpin. "Who they, doing?" I asked. "And faces covered?" "They belong body men," Godfather Gilpin's reply, "who bind ready turn certain offices mercy, pity, compassion sick, dying, dead. The brotherhood six hundred years old, still exists. The men belong receive pay, equally reject reward public praise, work covered faces, known even other. Rich men poor men, noble men working men, men letters ignorant, belong it, takes his turn comes round nurse sick, carry dying hospital, bury dead.' "Is dead man blue coverlet?" I asked awe. "I suppose so," said Godfather Gilpin. "But do not his friends go funeral?" I inquired. "He friends follow him," said godfather. "That he buried Brothers Pity." Long Godfather Gilpin told he could tell _Fratelli della Misericordia_--long I put congregation (including _Religious Orders_ Taylor's _Sermons_) back shelf belonged--the masked faces solemn garb men picture haunted me. I changed mind great many times, since I remember, I I grown up. Sometimes I thought I like officer die battle; sometimes I settled clergyman preach splendid sermons enormous congregations; I quite decided head fireman wear brass helmet, whirled lighted streets night, every one making way me, errands life death. But history Brothers Pity put conceit heroes. It seemed better anything I ever thought of--to good works unseen men, without hope reward, could make return. For rang ears Godfather Gilpin said, "He friends--that he buried Brothers Pity." I quite understood I thought must feel, I buried cat friends. It poor half-starved old thing, people belonged left it, I used see slinking back door looking Tabby, fat sleek, scraps unwashed dishes dinner. Mrs. Jones kicked every time, happened I found lying draggled dead bottom Ha-ha, top kettle still fastened scraggy tail, I never knew, cost bitter tears guess. It cost hard work, too, dig grave, spade small. I do not think Mrs. Jones would cared Brother Pity, she angry burying cat, wretched one, thin dirty, looked ugly smelt nasty. But I wanted give good funeral, I picked crimson lily put grave, seemed sad poor thing like might clean fluffy, fat comfortable, like Tabby, home people look it. It remembering cat made think Brothers Pity (not even Tuscany, I asked Godfather Gilpin) bury beasts birds fishes friends go funerals. And I settled Brother Pity without waiting till I grew could carry men. I shilling own, sixpence I bought yard half black calico post-office shop, Mrs. Jones made cloak it; sixpence I bought mask--for sell toys too. It right sort mask, I could make Mrs. Jones understand hood two eye-holes it, I like show her picture, she seen I wanted play burying people, perhaps she would made cloak. She made well, came ankles, I could hide spade it. The worst mask funny one, big nose; hid face same, get inside mask feel quite grave whatever it is painted like. I never happy summer one I Brother Pity. I heard Nurse saying Mrs. Jones "there telling would keep children mischief," I "never seemed tired old black rag ridiculous face." But dressing-up pleased day day, chance finding dead bodies friends bury them. Going quite new thing something look for; Godfather Gilpin says he felt days he used collect insects. I found good many corpses one sort another: birds mice frogs beetles, sometimes bigger bodies--such kittens dogs. The stand old wooden horse made capital thing drag on, wheels there, I piece blue cotton-velvet put top, day I found dead mole I cover him. I put outside, he looked like black velvet lying blue velvet. It seemed quite pity put dirty ground, lovely coat. One day I coming back burying mouse, I saw "flying watchman" beetle lying quite stiff dead, I thought, his legs stretched out, friends; I put bier once, put blue velvet him, drew place mouse's grave was. When I took pall felt him, turned over, he still quite rigid, I felt sure he dead, began dig his grave; I finished went back bier, flying watchman creeping wheel. He pretended dead, given trouble nothing. When first I became Brother Pity, I thought I would graveyard bury creatures in, afterwards I changed mind settled bury near wherever I found them. But I got bits white wood, fastened across bits wire, marked every grave. At last lots dotted fields woods I knew. I remembered belonged, even I forgotten, made good game, pretend stranger neighbourhood, pretend somebody else, talking myself, saying, "Wherever see little graves poor creature buried Brothers Pity." I like read burial service, fear quite right (especially frogs; many summer, horrid-looking, I used bury several together, pretend time plague); I like service all. So I put cloak mask, took spade bier, I said, "Brothers, let us prepare perform work mercy," first thing real _Fratelli della Misericordia_ say going out. And I buried body I said, "Go peace," last thing say. Godfather Gilpin told me, I learnt heart. I enjoyed much. There graves beasts birds died without friends hedges soft parts fields almost walks. I never showed Nurse, I often wondered she notice them. I always touched hat I passed them, sometimes difficult without her seeing me, made quite uncomfortable I passed grave without. When I could find bodies I amused making wreaths hang particularly nice poor beasts, bullfinch kitten. I Brother Pity several months, curious thing happened. One summer evening I went tea steep little field back house, old stone-quarry top, ledges which, earth settled, I used play making gardens. And there, lying bit stony ground, half stones half grass, dead robin-redbreast. I love robins much, I wanted one die, I thought one die, I like bury him, I wished find dead robin ever since I became Brother Pity. It rather late, wanted nearly hour usual bedtime, I thought I would go home dress spade bier, roses. For I resolved bury (my first robin-redbreast) grave lined rose-leaves, give wreath forget-me-nots. Just I going I heard loud buzz head, something hit face. It beetle, whirring air, I turned leave poor Robin beetle sat him, middle his red breast, still hearing buzzing, I found another beetle whirling whirring head air. I like beetles (especially flying watchmen), ones black too; I said, fun, "You have got black things, you will take care body till I get spade shall Brothers Pity." I ran home, I need gone indoors all, I keep cloak spade bier summer-house, bits wood nursery cupboard, so, I got good roses, quite ready, I ran up-stairs, there, great vexation, Nurse met me, said I go bed. I thought hard, hot day, I go walk heat sun along old coaching-road Nurse, seemed provoking, cool moon rising, I go bed, especially Nurse sending earlier usual she wanted go herself, I knew it. I tried go sleep, I could not. Every time I opened eyes moonlight like daylight white blind. At last I almost thought I must really sleep without knowing it, must morning. So I got bed, went window peeped; still moonlight--only moonlight bright day--and I saw Nurse two maids going upper gate park. In one moment I made mind. Nurse put bed get way. I mean trouble her, I determined lose chance Brother Pity robin-redbreast. I dressed well I could, got unobserved, made way summer-house. Things look little paler moonlight, otherwise I could see quite well. I put cloak, took spade handle bier right hand, holding mask face left, I made way quarry field. It lovely night, I strolled along I thought ground Robin lay stony spade, I must move little lower, soft earth bordered one side quarry. I certain I ever anything I think till then, I got quarry body gone place I found it; I looked lower, bit soft earth lay Robin, place I settling mind I would bury him. I could believe eyes holes mask, I pulled off, doubt fact. There he lay; round him, I looked closer, I saw ridge like rampart earth, framed neatly evenly, he already halfway his grave. The moonlight clear day, mistake I saw, whilst I looking body bird began sink little jerks, one pulling below. When first moved I thought poor Robin could dead all, he coming life like flying watchman, I soon saw he not, one pulling grave. When I felt quite sure this, I rubbed eyes clear them, pulled lashes see I awake, I horribly frightened that, mask one hand spade handle bier other, I ran home fast legs would carry me, leaving roses cross blue-velvet pall behind quarry. Nurse still out; I crept back bed without detection, I dreamed disturbedly invisible gravediggers night. I feel quite much afraid daylight, I bit less puzzled Cock Robin moved stony place soft earth, dug his grave. I could ask Nurse it, I tell her I out, I could trusted Mrs. Jones either; Godfather Gilpin never tells tales me, he knows everything, I went him. The I thought I saw way tell everything; tell parts things sometimes find telling lies know are. So I put cloak mask, took shovel bier study, sat little foot-stool I always wait Godfather Gilpin middle reading, keeps his head show he want disturbed. When he shut his book looked he burst laughing. I meant asked why, I busy afterwards I forgot. I suppose nose, got rather broken I fell I burying old drake Neptune killed. But he kind me, I told Brother Pity, I wanted bury robin, I found one, he frightened burying himself. "Some Brother Pity must found him," said godfather, still laughing. "And he must got Jack Giant-killer's cloak darkness _his_ dress, see him." "There nobody there," I earnestly answered, shaking mask I thought still, lonely moonlight. "Nothing two beetles, I said would take care might Brothers Pity." "They took word, _mio fratello_. Take mask, little distracts me, I tell buried Cock Robin." I knew Godfather Gilpin really telling things--without thinking something else, I mean,--and I listened ears. "The beetles properly admitted brotherhood," said godfather, "were burying beetles, sexton beetles,[A] sometimes called. They bury animals sizes surprisingly short space time. If two cannot conduct funeral, summon others. They carry bodies, necessary, suitable ground. With flat heads (for sexton beetle carry shovel do) dig trench trench round body committing earth, creep pull down, shovel away more, till deep enough in, push earth tread pat neatly down." "Then beetles burying robin-redbreast?" I gasped. "I suspect so," said Godfather Gilpin. "But go see." He actually knocked book his hurry get his hat, I helped pick up, said, "Why, godfather, you are bad I Taylor's _Sermons_," he said, "I old fool, dear. I used fond insects I settled work I am now, quite excites go fields again." I never nicer walk, he showed lots things I never noticed, got quarry field; I took straight place bit soft earth was, nothing seen, earth quite smooth tidy. But he poked his stick ground soft, he poked little saw nut-brown feathers, knew Robin's grave. And I said, "Do not poke more, please. I wanted bury rose-leaves, beetles dressed black, I gave leave, I think I will put cross him, I do not think it is untrue show he buried Brothers Pity." Godfather Gilpin quite agreed me, made nice mound (for I brought spade), put best kind cross, afterwards I made wreath forget-me-nots hang it. He robin-redbreast I found since I became Brother Pity, I buried all. Many walks Nurse likes take I care about, one place she likes go to, especially Sunday, I like too, churchyard. I always fond it. It nice read tombstones, fancy people like, particularly ones lived long ago, 1600 something, beautifully-shaped sixes capital letters graves. For must dressed quite differently us, perhaps knew Charles First Oliver Cromwell. Diggory gravedigger never talks much, I like watch him. I think he rather deaf, I asked he thought, he went long enough, he could dig side world, he said "Hey?" chucked great shovelful earth. But perhaps he deep he could hear. Now, he quite sight, chucks earth like that, makes think sexton beetles; Godfather Gilpin says drive flat heads straight down, lift sharp jerk, throw earth so. I said Diggory one day, "Do not wish head flat, instead is, could shovel instead spade?" He was not deep time, he heard me, put his head grave rested his spade. But he scratched his head stared, said, "You uncommon queer young gentleman, sure," went digging again. And I afraid he angry, I dare not ask more. I dare not course ask he Brother Pity, I think he deserves be, workhouse burials rate; Porter Silly Billy funeral, I do not think call friends. I taken beetles brothers, course. Godfather Gilpin says I find far bodies I burying along. I often wish I could understand hum, knew me. I wonder either Diggory know belong order _Fratelli della Misericordia_, I belong too? But course would right ask them, even either would answer me, "known, even other," really truly Brothers Pity. NOTE--Burying beetles full skilful described tale. With due respect graces art, I embodied fact feed carcases bury. The last thing burying beetle does, tidying grave, make small hole go himself, previously buried his partner prey. Here eggs laid, larvæ hatched fed. FOOTNOTES: [Footnote A: _Necrophorus humator_, &c.] FATHER HEDGEHOG AND HIS NEIGHBOURS. * * * * * CHAPTER I. The care large family light matter, everybody knows. And year I unusually large family. No less seven young urchins Mrs. Hedgehog take care start life; prickly parent side brook, within three fields beyond, four. My father's brother six one year, I know. It summer I born. I remember hearing father mother talk I could see. As six cousins discussed tone interest respect seemed bear somewhat disparagingly brother sisters (there four _us_), I rather glad learn also born blind. My father used go see them, report progress mother his return. "They see to-day." "They curled up. Every one them. Six beautiful little balls; round crab-apples safe burrs!" I tried curl up, I could get coat little way nose. I cried vexation. But one lose heart easily. With patience perseverance things brought about, I could soon see curl ball. It time father hurried home one day, tossing leaves least three inches his head he bustled along. "What hedge think happened six?" said he. "Oh, do not tell me!" cried mother; "I nervous." (Which she was, rather foolish well, used irritate father, hasty tempered, I myself.) "They have taken gipsies flitted," said he. "What mean _flitted_?" inquired mother. "A string tied round hind-leg each, tethered grass behind tent, donkey tethered. So remain till grow fat, cooked." "Will donkey cooked he fat?" asked mother. "I smell valerian," said father; she put her nose, he ran his prickles. He always he annoyed member his family; though knew coming, fond valerian, could never resist temptation sniff, chance about. I long wanted see cousins, I begged father let go next time he went visit them. But he rather cross morning, he ran his back up. "So want gad kidnapped flitted too, you? Just let me--" But I saw coming, I rolled tight wood-louse, ears inside I really hear else he said. But I whit less resolved see cousins. One day father bustled home. "Upon whine," said he, "they live fat land. Scraps kinds, apples, dish bread milk noses. I sat inside gorse bush bank, watched till mouth watered." The next day he reported-- "They have cooked one--in clay. There five now." And next day-- "They have cooked another. Now four." "There will not cousin left I wait much longer," thought I. On morrow three. My mother began cry. "My poor dear nephews nieces!" said she (though she never seen them). "What world is!" "We must take eat eggs," said father, air wisdom naturally belongs sayings head family, "the she will yolk. And certainly excellent victuals." Next morning he went usual, I crept stealthily him. With his spines laid flat his sides, his legs well him, he ran good round pace, he look back I followed impunity. By he climbed bank crept furze bush, whose prickles match his own. I dared go right bush fear he see me, I settled well I could shelter furze branch, looked side bank, father's nose also directed. And I saw three cousins, tethered he said, apparently busy over-eating food trouble procuring. If I heard less cooking, I might envied them; was, somewhat voracious appetite characteristic family disturbed judgment sufficiently make almost long flitted myself. I fancy must I pushed nose sniffed involuntarily towards victuals, gipsy man heard me. He lying grass, looking much lazier cousins--which saying good deal--and turning his swarthy face gipsy girl, she moved tended fire, got sight his eyes. Then he moved he could see her again; not, seemed, see she help her it, leaves move wind, unpacked noses wills father said he smelt valerian. She beautiful. Her skin like trout pool--clear yet brown. I never saw eyes like her eyes, though neighbour's--the Water Rat--at times recalls them. Her hair colour ripe blackberries hot hedge--very ripe ones, bloom on. She moved like snake. I seen father chase snake once, I seen good many men women time. Some walk like father, bustle along kick leaves he does; move quickly yet softly, snakes go. The gipsy girl moved so, wherever she went gipsy man's eyes went her. Suddenly he turned me. For instant I paralyzed stood still. I could hear father bustling bank; minutes he would home, brother sisters safe sound, whilst I alone reap reward disobedience, fate he warned me--to taken gipsies flitted. Nothing, dear children--my seven dear children--is fatal emergency indecision. I half disposed hurry father, half resolved curl ball. I one foot half back rounded, gipsy man pinned ground stick, gipsy girl strode up. I could writhe away stick, I gazed beseechingly gipsy girl squealed life. "Let poor little brute go, Basil," she said, laughing. "We have three flitted still." "Let go?" cried young man scornfully, another poke, I thought crushed bits, though I still able cry aloud. The gipsy girl turned her back went away one movement without speaking. "Sybil!" cried man; she look round. "Sybil, I say!" She breaking sticks fire slowly across her knee, she made answer. He took his stick back, went her. "I have let go," he said, throwing again, "and good dinner gone it. But like me--and small thanks I get it." "I anything keep mischief," she answered, fixing her eyes steadily him. He sat began throw stones, aiming three cousins. "Take good all, instead tormenting me, will," he said. "Will give Jemmy his gang?" she asked; he hesitated instant, she tossed curls back her face moved away, saying, "Not you; talk! And yet sake, _I_ would give up--" He bounded his feet, she put bonfire them, he could get round it, she side tilted cart, another woman, crimson cloak, sat something dirty pack cards. I like see gipsy man his feet again, somewhat recovered breath, I scrambled bank got home quickly stiffness soreness skin would allow. I never saw cousins again, long I saw gipsies; day's adventure gave shock children owe exceeding care prudence I display choice summer homes winter retreats, repressing every tendency wandering disposition among members family. CHAPTER II. That summer--I mean summer I seven--we charming home imaginable. It wood, side wood farthest houses highroads. Here bounded brook, beyond lay fine pasture field. There fields fields. I never wish know better field one. I seldom go much till evening, business take one along hedge heat sun, juicy refreshing crabs picked tree half-way south side, thirstiest creature could desire. And glare drought midday given place mild twilight evening, grass refreshingly damped dew, scents strong, earth yields kindly nose, beetles lob-worms reward one's routing! I convinced fattest stupidest slugs live, live near brook. I never knew one found I eating him, till he half-way throat. And opposite place I furnished dear mother's nest, small plantation burdocks, underside stick best flavoured snails I acquainted with, inexhaustible quantities, hedgehog might fourteen children season, fear coming short provisions. And early summer, long grass edge wood--but no! I speak it. My dear children, seven dear children, may never know taste pheasant's egg--to taste several pheasant's eggs, eat them, shells all. There certain pleasures parent may partaken, which, he cannot reconcile his ideas safety propriety, he well allow his children even hear of. I say I wish I never tasted pheasant's egg myself, but, I think traps baited valerian, great-uncle's great-coat nailed keeper's door, keeper's heavy-heeled boots, impropriety poaching, I feel, father, desirable never know things eggs, quite happy without them. But abundant varied supply food determined choice home: even woodland bower could beautiful,--because coppice foliage fresh tender overhead, old leaves soft elastic prickles below,--because young oaks sheltered us behind, charming outlook brook front, gnarled alder young sycamore, whose embracing branches lintel doorway. No. I chose particular spot particular wood, I reason believe somewhat neglected bit men call "property,"--because bramble bushes unbroken, fallen leaves untrodden, hyacinths ragged-robins ungathered human feet hands,--because old fern-fronds faded fresh green plumes,--because violets ripened seed,--because trees unmarked woodmen overpopulated birds, water-rat sat sun crossed paws without thought danger,--because, short, birds'-nesting, fern-digging, flower-picking, leaf-mould-wanting, vermin-hunting creatures ever came hither replenish ferneries, gardens, cages, markets, museums. My feelings therefore imagined I roused afternoon nap one warm summer's day voices men women. Several possibilities came mind, I imparted wife. "They may keepers." "They may poachers." "They may boys birds'-nesting." "They may street-sellers ferns, moss, forth." "They may collectors specimens." "They may pic-nic-ers--people bring salt twisted bit paper them, leave behind go away. Do not let children touch it!" "They may be--and worst could happen--men collecting frogs, toads, newts, snails, _and hedgehogs_ London markets. We must keep quiet. They go away sunset." I quite wrong, I heard slow wheels cart I knew it. They none things, go away. They travelling tinkers, settled made home within fifty yards mine. My nerves never strong since day furze bush. My first impulse roll tightly I got cramp, whilst every spine back stood stiff fright. But time I recovered myself, took counsel Mrs. Hedgehog. "Two things," said she, "are important. We must keep children gadding, must make hold tongues." "They never foolish wish quit side, dear, circumstances," said I. But I mistaken. I know nothing annoying father learned danger indiscreet curiosity his youth, find his sons apparently quite uninfluenced his valuable experience. "What tinkers like?" first thing said one seven subject. "They set people," I replied, voice sour green crab, "who hear us talking, catch us walking abroad, kill mother me, temper two bits clay roll us them. Then put us fire bake, clay turns red take us out. The clay fall coats it. What remains eat--as eat snails. You seven flitted. That is, pegged ground till grow big." (I thought well mention bread milk.) "Then kill bake eat fashion." I think frightened children; would talk tinkers, though dared go near them. "The best thing do," said Mrs. Hedgehog, "is tell story keep quiet. You modulate voice, stop hear tinkers." Hereupon I told story (a old one) hedgehog ran race hare, opposite sides hedge, wager louis d'or bottle brandy. It great favourite them. "The moral tale, dear children," I will not say, "is, respected ancestor's head saved his heels, never case giddy-pated creatures like hare." "Perhaps young hare," said Mrs. Hedgehog, amiable, like blame one avoided. "I do not think _very_ young hare," said I, "or hedgehog would eaten instead outwitting him. As was, he placed Mrs. Hedgehog opposite ends course. The hare started one side hedge hedgehog other. Away went hare like wind, Mr. Hedgehog took three steps went back his place. When hare reached his end hedge, Mrs. Hedgehog, side, called out, 'I am already.' Her voice her coat like her husband's, hare observant enough remark slight difference size colour. The moral is, dear children, one must use his eyes well his legs world. The hare tried several runs, always hedgehog goal he got there. So he gave last, ancestors walked comfortably home, taking louis d'or bottle brandy them." "What louis d'or?" cried three children; "What brandy?" asked four. "I smell valerian," said I; poked seven noses, I ran spines, father Encyclopædia fours must adopt _some_ method checking inquisitiveness young. When grown-up people desire information take interest neighbours, this, course, another matter. Mrs. Hedgehog I never seen tinkers, resolved take early opportunity evening sending seven urchins burdock plantations pick snails, whilst paid cautious visit tinker camp. But mothers sad fidgets, anxious Mrs. Hedgehog gratify her curiosity, she kept putting expedition till children's spines harder; I made one two careful ones myself, told her news return. CHAPTER III. "The animal Man," I heard uncle, learned hedgehog, say,--"the animal man diurnal animal; he comes feeds daytime." But second cousin, travelled far Covent Garden, lived many years London kitchen, told he thought uncle wrong, man comes feeds night. He said he knew least one house crickets black-beetles never got quiet kitchen till nearly morning. But I think uncle right men country. I sure tinker his family slept night. He his wife great deal day. They went away wood left children old woman, tinker's mother. At one time away several days, usual time going children asleep, old woman used sit camp fire her head her hands. "The language men, dear," I observed Mrs. Hedgehog, "is quite different ours, even general tone; I assure I first heard tinker's mother, I could wagered louis d'or bottle brandy I heard hedgehogs whining other. In fact, I remonstrate imprudence, I found old woman moaning muttering herself." "What matter her?" asked Mrs. Hedgehog. "I curious know myself," said I, "and I overheard, I think I inform you. She tinker's mother, judging he said night, means indulgent he child. She harsh enough his young brats now; appears she devoted older son, one children his first wife; loss grandchild she vexes herself." "Is he dead?" "No, dear, but--" "Has he flitted?" "Something kind, I fear. He taken prison." "Dear, dear!" said Mrs. Hedgehog; "what trial mother's feelings! Will bake him?" "I think not," said I. "I fancy he tethered punishment taking belong him; grandmother's grievance seems she believes he unjustly convicted. She thinks real robber gipsy. Just I taken, skin nailed keeper's door pheasant's eggs I never pleasure eating." Mrs. Hedgehog dying curiosity. She said she thought children's spines strong enough anything likely happen them; next fresh damp evening sent seven urchins burdocks pick snails, crept cautiously towards tinker's encampment see could see. And there, smouldering embers bonfire, sat old woman moaning, I described her, her elbows her knees, rocking nursing her head, her long hair looped fell, like grey rags, her withered fingers. "I do not like her looks," snorted Mrs. Hedgehog. "And disgustingly trampled grass." "It quite true," said I; "it recover summer. I wish left us wood ourselves." At moment Mrs. Hedgehog laid her five toes mine, attract attention, whispered--"Is gipsy?" lifting nose direction rustling brushwood, I saw Sybil. There mistaking her, though her cheeks looked hollower her eyes larger I saw her last. "Good-evening, mother," she said. The old woman raised her gaunt face start, cried fiercely, "Begone you! Begone!" bent upon her hands, muttering, "There plenty hedges ditches good lot, without coming worrit us wood." The gipsy girl knelt quietly fire, stirred embers. "What matter, mother?" she said. "We have come, I heard Tinker George his mother wood, I started find you. 'You makes free tinkers,' says brother's wife. 'I goes see mother,' says I, 'who nursed sickness, real mother dead, people wanting bury able speak move, wanting get Bartelmy Fair.' I never forget, mother; forgotten me, drives away bidding good-day?" "Good days me," moaned old woman. "Begone, I say! Do not let see hear belongs Black Basil, may worse them." ("The tinker-mother whines nastily," said Mrs. Hedgehog. "If I young woman, I bite her." "Hush!" I answered, "she speaking.") "Basil prison," said gipsy girl hoarsely. The old woman's eyes shone sockets, she looked Sybil minute, read gipsy's sentence her face; she chuckled, "So they have taken Terror Roads?" Sybil's eyes moved fire, she standing clasped hands. "The Terror Roads?" she said. "Yes, call that,--but I could turn round finger, mother." Her voice dropped, she smoothed one her black curls absently round her finger she spoke. "You could not keep prison," taunted old woman. "I could not keep mischief," said girl, sadly; then, sudden flash anger, she clasped her hands her head cried, "A black curse Jemmy his gang!" "A black curse let us innocent go prison stead. They comes end, long may hold them!" reply. Sybil moved swiftly old woman's side. "I heard trouble, mother, Christian; do not think--" "_Think!_" screamed old woman, shaking her fists, whilst girl interrupted her-- "Hush, mother, hush! tell now, tell all, loud," kneeling her back us, she said something low voice, old woman replied whine much moderated, though Mrs. Hedgehog I strained ears, crept near group dared, could catch word. Only, Sybil rose walked back slowly fire, twisting long lock her hair before, saying--"I turns round finger, mother, far _that_ goes--" "So thinks," said old crone. "But he never will--even would, Sybil Stanley! Oh Christian, child, child!" The gipsy girl stood still, like young poplar-tree dead calm thunder; fell silence, I dared moved myself, allowed Mrs. Hedgehog move, three steps softest grass, fear heard. Then Sybil said abruptly, "I have never rightly heard Christian, mother. What made think much thinks others?" CHAPTER IV. "My son's first wife died Christian born," said old woman. "I have sharp tongue, know, Sybil Stanley, I am doubtful she happy she lived; she gone I knew she would good 'un, I have always spoken her accordingly. "You are young remember year; year slack trade hard times over. Farmer-folk grudged fourpence mend kettle, broken victuals, was not much went front door feed family, servants would thrown back door another year feed pigs. "When one gets old, daughter, sits fire night thinks, instead tramping day sleeping heavy it, one one young--things comes back; things comes back, I say, says ghosts does. "And camps near trees long branches, like there, waves wind confuses eyes among smoke, I sometimes think I sees her face, she died, pinched look across nose. That Christian's mother, son's first wife; comes back I believes she starved herself let more; he is man surly temper, like own, son George. He grumbled worse children he hungry, she slow getting strong enough stand her legs carry basket. You see he did not hold his tongue things bad bear, she could. Men does not, daughter." "I know, I know," said girl. "I thinks I jealous her," muttered old woman; "it comes back I begrudged her making much son, I knows she good 'un, I speaks her accordingly. She fretted herself getting strong enough carry child christened, convenience parson near hand, I was not going oblige her; day she died, child ailing, thinking might require benefit burial-service well herself, I wrapped up, made decent, took way village. I half-way street, I met young gentlewoman grey dress coming cottage. "'Good-day, pretty lady,' says I. 'Could show old woman residence clergyman would poor tinkers kindness christening sick child whose mother lies dead tilted cart meeting four roads?' "'I am clergyman's wife,' says she, colour her face, 'and I am sure husband christen poor baby. Do let see it.' "'It is tinker's child,' says I, 'a poor brown-faced morsel pretty lady's blue eyes rest upon, that is accustomed delicate sight her golden-haired children; long may live, many may gentle clergyman them!' "'I children,' says she, shortly, colour her face breaking red white patches her cheeks. 'Let carry baby you,' says she, taking me. 'You must tired.' "All way she kept looking it, saying pretty was, beautiful long eyelashes had, went time, daughter, I knowed like mother. "The clergyman pleasing young gentleman genteel appearance, great deal say way religion, right, his business. 'Name child,' says he, she gives start nobody sees myself. So, thinking child likely die, loss obliging gentlefolk, says I, looking book I could read, 'Any name lady thinks suitable poor tinker's child;' says she, colour coming her face, 'Call Christian, he shall one.' So he named Christian, name give manner displeasure family; husband's father, unfortunate matter horse-stealing, died across water." "What _she_ want naming baby, mother?" asked Sybil. "I comes that, daughter, I comes that, though it is hard speak of. I hate worse I hates police I thinks it. But ten pounds--pieces gold, daughter, half-pence hard come by--and small expectation he would outlive his mother many days--and feeling then, her sake, though I thinks differently now--" "You sold clergy-folks?" said Sybil. "Ten pieces gold! You never felt pains starvation, daughter--nor perhaps jealousy, worse. The young clergywoman children, score she fretted herself; must fretted hard, she begged poor tinker's child woods." "What Tinker George say?" asked girl. "He used good deal bad language, said I might easily got twenty pounds ten, I big fool child's mother herself. Men strange creatures, daughter." "So left Christian them?" "I did, daughter. I left arms young clergywoman politest words sides, good deal religious conversation parson, I doubt well meant, somewhat tedious." "And then--mother?" "And moved Banbury, son took his second wife, made her acquaintance alehouse; then, daughter, I begins know Christian's mother good 'un." "George is not happy one, then?" "Men curious creatures, daughter, discover part without instructions me. He treats her far better other, she treats much worse. But soon put a-one-side, I sat long evenings alone, sometimes wood, might this, branches waves makes confusion shadows--and sometimes edge Hampshire heath camps good deal, light slow dying bottom sky he she coming home, bits water looks people drownded them--when I sat alone, I say, minding fire children--I wondered Christian lived, till I mad wondering coming nearer knowing. "'His mother good daughter you,' I thinks; 'and had not sold him--sold flesh blood--for ten golden sovereigns clergywoman, he might good son old age.' "At last I could bear idleness lone company thoughts longer, daughter, I sets travel account, taking money back-doors, living broken meats I begged bargain, working nights instead thinking. I knows arts, daughter, one sort another, I puts away I takes, changes copper comes silver, _the silver comes gold_." "I wonder never went see he alive," said Sybil. "I did, daughter. I went several times various disguisements, difficulty know adopt them, servant's jewellery children's toys, I sight once, time made wilder get back." "And never tried?" "The money ready. One must act honourably, daughter. I could not pick grandson he would stray hen, clothes line. It took five years save ten pounds. Five long miserable years." "Miserable!" cried gipsy girl, flinging her hair back her eyes. "Miserable! Happy, mean; happy! It one nothing--" She stopped, talking choked her, old woman, seemed pay little attention one herself, went on, "It saved, I hangs country, making plans, he comes himself, I sits outskirts wood beyond village, manner disguisement, I sits here." "He came you?" said Sybil. "He comes me, daughter; dressed like young nobleman eight years old, bareheaded barefooted, his cap one hand, his boots stockings other. "'Good-morning, old gipsy woman,' says he. 'I heard old gipsy woman wood; I came see. Nurse said I went fields, myself, gipsies would steal me; I told her I did not care did, must nice live wood, sleep doors night. When I grow up, I mean wild man desert island, dress goats' skins. I shall not wear hats--I hate them; I do not like shoes stockings either. When I get away Nurse, I always take off. I like feel I am walking on, wood I like scuffle toes dead leaves. There is quarry top wood, I liked thrown shoes stockings cap it; vexes mother I destroy clothes, I did not, I carrying them.' "Those words he said, daughter. He swiftness tongue, I famous, especially fortune-telling; he used language gentility, shortness speech observe among accustomed order want instead asking it. I hard work summon voice reply him, daughter, I cannot tell you, would understand I could find words, feelings hear speak confidence young clergywoman his mother. "'A green welcome woods fields, noble little gentleman,' says I. 'Be pleased honour poor tinker-woman accepting refreshment seat cup tea.' "'I may not eat drink anything I visiting poor people,' says he, 'Mother does not allow me. But thank same, please do not give stool, I would much rather sit grass; and, please, I like tell living woods, making fires, hanging kettles sticks, going country sleeping doors.'" "Did tell truth, make tale him?" asked Sybil. "Partly one partly other, daughter. But persons sets minds anything, sees truth manner according thoughts, good made-up tale. "He asks numberless questions, I makes suitable replies. Them lives doors--can get early likes, without called? he asks. "Does gipsies go bed clothes? "Does sometimes forget prayers, regularly dressing undressing? "Did I ever sleep heather? "Does ever travel moonlight? "Do I see sun rise every morning? "Did I ever meet highwayman? "Does I believe ghosts? "Can I really tell fortunes? "I takes his shapely little hand--as brown own, daughter, his mother, like myself, pure Roman, looked upon her people consequence marrying son, mixed blood (my husband family, every respect, undeserving slightest mention). "'Let tell fortune, noble little gentleman,' I says. 'The lines life crossed early travelling. Far wander, many things see. Stone houses houses brick detain you. In big house blue roof green carpet born, big house blue roof green carpet die. The big house delicately perfumed, noble little gentleman, especially month May; time also abundance music, singers sits overhead. Give old gipsy woman sight comely feet, little gentleman, soles difficult see born wander.' "With similar jaw I entertained him, daughter, his eyes looks his face till I feels dead come back; he way besides frightened me, I knew came living gentlefolk. "'Are mighty learned, dear?' says I. 'Are well instructed books schooling?' "'I say English History verse,' he says, 'and I compound addition; I know Catechism, lots hymns. Would like hear me?' "'If please, little gentleman,' I says. "'What shall I say?' he asks. 'I know English History, I always quite sure kings come; know kings give name, I know verses quite well. And I know Catechism perfectly, perhaps do not know questions without book. The hymns course do not want book for, I know best all.' "'I learned, myself,' says I, 'and I know two kings--the king England--who, matter, queen, good woman, say, one could come her--and king gipsies, big blackguard could desire know, means entitled call king, though he gets lot money it, he spends public-house. As regards thing, dear, I certainly know questions without book, nor, indeed, I know book, neither there; hymns require learning part, I gives preference them.' "'I like _them_ best, myself,' he says; he puts his hat his shoes stockings ground, stands folds his hands behind his back, repeats large number religious verses, readiness young clergyman speaks book. "It partly went me, daughter, I religious myself, he always fond holy words, I thinks brings ill-luck. But his voice sweet thrush sits singing thorn-bush, something verses tendency make feel uncomfortable, I feels disturbed I cares show. But oh, daughter, I loves him! "'The blessing old gipsy woman young head,' I says. 'Fair skies wanders, shady spots rests! "'May water clear wood dry camps! "'May every road treads turf wayside, patteran[B] friend left.' "'What patteran?' he asks. "'It secret,' I says, looking somewhat sternly him. 'The roads keeps it, hedges keeps it--' "'I keep it,' he says boldly. 'Pinch finger, try me!' "As he speaks he holds his little finger, I pinches it, daughter, till colour dies his lips, though he keeps set, I delights see nobleness endurance him. So I explains patteran him, shows two bits hawthorn laid crosswise, I regard stranger, I sees he keep his lips shut required. "He practising patteran feet, I hears cry 'Christian!' I cannot explain chill came heart sound. "Trouble age lone company thoughts, daughter, tendency confuse you; I means rightly certain times things I sees hears. I sees Christian's mother I knows she cannot there, though I believes one person calling child, yet, echo comes quarry, worse twenty echoes mind, seems wood full voices calling him. "In foolishness, daughter, I sits like stone, he springs his feet, snatches his things, says, 'Good-bye, old gipsy woman, thank much. I like stay you,' he says, 'but Nurse calling me, Mother get frightened I long away she does not know where. But I shall come back.' "I never quite knows, daughter, whether echo repeated his words, whether voice I hears, I stretches old arms him, crying, 'Come back!' "But he runs shouting, 'Coming, coming!' "And wood deafens me, full voices. "_Christian! Christian!--Coming! Coming!_ "And I thinks I kind fit, daughter, I wakes, wood still death, he gone, dreams goes." CHAPTER V. "I really feel tinker-mother," whispered Mrs. Hedgehog. "I feel her myself," reply. "The cares family heavy enough last season, one sleeps winter's nap. When--as case men--they last lifetime, never get one night's rest time, must almost unendurable. As prolonging one's anxieties one's families families one's children--no parent his senses--" "What gipsy girl saying now?" asked Mrs. Hedgehog, paying attention women observations--an annoyance which, head family, I subjected oftener becoming. Sybil kneeling old woman's feet, soothing her chafing her hands. At last she said, "But get him, Mother. How it?" "Not five years, daughter. And never time could I get sight his face. The first house I calls next morning, I sees chalk mark gate-post, placed travelling tinker pedler not, I knows neighbourhood made hot tramps vagrants, call us. And go back disguisement I might, selling bootlace, begging crust bread there--_there_, _he_ lived. "I makes ten pounds, ties bag; I gets worse worse health spirits confusion mind, daughter; I comes accidentally across son Bedfordshire lane, his wife drinking, he much bewilderment children, I takes them, I Christian comes second time." "He came back you?" "Learning confinement stone walls, daughter, two things could contrary nature dwells woods lanes. I deny clergyman--and especially young clergywoman--had good him; he would probably run away long before. But bred bone comes flesh. He pretty well learning, he bears confinement school, though worse clergy-house. But rumour crept he son clergyman clergywoman, he taunted gipsy vagrant, he lays his bare hands nearest him, daughter, comes away his bare feet." "How he find you, Mother?" "He fixed intentions beyond running away, daughter; he sitting hedge bandage one his feet his handkerchief, he sees patteran, he goes on, keeping left, sees again, follows it, comes home." "You mean he came you?" "I do, dear. For home house never moves one place, built stone brick, front door genteel back door common people. If so, prisons would homes. But home, daughter, persons belongs to, may hedge to-day fair to-morrow." "Mother," said Sybil, "what ten pounds?" "I tell you, daughter. I obliged wait longer agreeable proceeding neighbourhood, police searching everywhere, would wearisome relate difficulty Christian concealed. My plans long made, know. "Clergyfolk, daughter, tediousness jaw makes oppressive listen long houses rest long in, good points like persons; shows kindness trouble, spends money freely poor. This well known, even liking parsons, I observed persons goes straight public-house money pockets, goes straight parson pockets empty. "It also well known, daughter, clergyman collects money speaking his church, he does not take his use, custom people, Punch Judy men, singers, fortune tellers; time he pleased good collection his use; rich person contributes sovereign sick poor, would you, daughter, hand crossed gold noble gentleman crossed love. "I explain this, dear, may understand I planned pay back clergy people's ten pounds church, would good paying hands, advantage secrecy myself. On Saturday I drives little market donkey-cart greens, Sunday morning I goes church respectable disguisement, sexton puts pew women infirm mind workhouse dresses, which, daughter, I much restrain knocking down. But I does; I behaves service utmost care, following movements genteeler portion company, pew manners all; one standing time giggling pew-back, another sitting corner weeping her lap. "But exception getting sitting down, holding book open near middle I could guess, I pays little attention, daughter, thoughts taken waiting collection begin, trying keep eyes clergywoman's face, I see quite clearly, though she distance me." "Did she look wild, Mother, she felt beside herself?" "She looked bad, daughter, grey, age. I tells I tried look her; collection begins. "It seems hours me, daughter, whilst money chinking clergyman speaking, ten pieces gold getting hot hands, I fancies burns me, still one collecting-men comes near pew. "At last, one one, begins go past go clergyman waiting upper end, I perceives regards us poor pay way like rest, plates never put pew all. So last one going past me, I puts hand beckon him, woman standing bursts laughing, cries worse ever, collecting-man says, 'Hush! hush!' goes past takes plate him. "'A black curse insolence!' says I; I grips laughing woman arm whispers, 'If make noise again, I will break head,' she sits begins cry like other. "There one collecting-man, comes last, he Duke, lives big house. "The nobility gentry, daughter, real thing, has, like real Romans, quickness catch meaning, politeness manner does not meet among people keeper small shop master workhouse. The Duke old man, bent shoulders slow step age, I thinks he see hear quickly; I beckons he goes past. But he way past he looks back. And he sees hand out, he turns comes slowly again, hands plate much politeness I his pew, he says low voice, 'I beg pardon.' "But I sees stumbling back, knows his politeness he bring plate, comes fear me, daughter, he may see ten pieces gold think I stolen them. And I knows I shall do, nobility gentry, though quick polite matter obliging poor, one,--when sits poknees[C] administer justice, loses good sense good manners completely police. "But comes also real one--such out-and-outer--his politeness may great he may look another way, rather peep pry see poor workhouse-company woman puts plate. And I right, daughter, he looks away, I lays ten golden sovereigns plate, he gives little smile little bow, goes slowly stumblingly upper end, clergyman still speaking verses. "And then, daughter, hands, made gold sovereigns hot, turns hot, I gets goes church much respectfulness quiet I able. "And I tries look her face I turns shut door, I unable keep so, looked I see now, dear, I know I shall remember till I die. I thinks somehow she praying, though praying part service, I looks upper end I sees eyes young clergyman her husband fixed her, mine is. "And words he preached day verses he spoke much readiness, I could repeat one you, daughter, save life, except words he saying then, remains ears her face remains eyes,-- "'GOD unrighteous, He forget work, labour proceedeth love.'" CHAPTER VI. "We creatures habit." So learned uncle, Draen Coed, Welsh hedgehog, used say. "Which ancestor own, acted turnspit kitchen farmhouse Yorkshire, quite abandoned family custom walking cool evening, declared he could not take two steps comfort except circle, front kitchen-fire roasting heat." Uncle Draen Coed right, I must add I doubt if, his experience, among strange traditions his eccentric ancestors, he could find instance change habits unexpected, complete, I may say headlong, quiet people, almost surly attachment home, break bounds domestic circle, take gadding, gossiping, excitement. Perhaps find fellow-creatures nicer will not allow be, people's affairs quite interesting own. Perhaps--but good trying explain infatuations? Why love valerian? I record that, set every prickle backs intruders wood, dreaded nothing neighbours forsake us, wished nothing better fresh arrivals. In old days, excellent partner I used take evening stroll field, will not regard quite grievance cousin, lived far end hedge, came caught us detained us gossip. But I could hardly settle midday nap thinking tinker-mother; Mrs. Hedgehog, she almost annoyed her anxiety see Christian. However, curiosity foible her sex, I accompanied her daily encampment without murmur. The seven urchins sent burdocks pick snails. It many days heard old tinker-mother relate Christian's history, stopped way corner usually concealed ourselves, hearing strange voices winding pathway us. "It is young man," said I. "It is Christian!" cried Mrs. Hedgehog. "I feel sure not," said I; "but keep quiet, I creep little forward see." I always right, I make point reminding Mrs. Hedgehog whenever dispute; I right occasion. The lad spoke young gentleman seventeen, like gipsy I am. His fair hair closely cropped, his eyes quick bright, his manner alert almost anxious, though he slight well young, he carried dignity little importance. A lady, much older himself, him, he helping path. "Take care, Gertrude, take care. There hurry, I believe there is one wood ourselves." "The people inn told us gipsies neighbourhood," said lady; "and oh, Ted! exactly wood I dreamt of, except purple white--" "Gertrude! What earth after?" "The flowers, Ted, flowers dream! There are, perfect carpet them. White--oh, lovely!--and there, side, purple ones. What they, dear? I know good botanist. He always raved collection." "Nonsense, I am botanist. Several fellows went prize offered, collection good his doing. I never see one arrange flowers he did, I must say. Every specimen pressed somehow keep way growing. And I them, columbine looked stiff dog-daisy. I never could keep character them. Watson--the fellow drew well--made vignettes blank pages lots specimens--'Likely Habitats' called them. He used sit his paint-box window, Christian used sit outside window, edge, dangling his legs, describing scenes his head Watson draw. Watson used say, 'I wish I could paint brush fellow paints his tongue'--and vignettes admired, I have heard say, his dry way, 'I copied Christian's paintings;' fellows used stare, know he could not draw line. And when--But I say, Gertrude, Heaven's sake, do not devour everything I say great pitiful eyes yours. I regular brute talk him." "No, Ted, no. It makes happy hear you, know know good he really was, much he must aggravated before--" "For goodness' sake, do not cry. Christian good fellow, capital fellow. I never thought I could got well one was--I mean was not--well, course I mean really gipsy. I do not blame bit resenting bullied his parents. I blame looking better him. But know well enough--you know it is I never forgive managed badly put care, I backing mad expedition, though I do not approve one bit, though I know John blame awfully." ("It is clergywoman," whispered Mrs. Hedgehog excitedly, "and I must see her." When comes Mrs. Hedgehog's sex, nothing let dear creatures way, take consequences. She pushed her nose straight lower branches arbutus concealed, I managed get nearer sight new neighbours. As crept forward, clergywoman got she kneeling amongst flowers, laid her hand young gentleman's arm. I noticed I never seen white hand before; Sybil's paws nearly dark own.) "John blame one find Christian," she said. "You very, good, Cousin Ted, come help believe dream. But must say odd flowers. And have not told yet are." "It bulbous-rooted fumitory," said young man, pulling piece random reckless way men disfigure forest flower-beds. "It is not strictly indigenous, naturalized many places, must seen before, though fancy have not." "I seen before," she said earnestly--"all delicate glaucous-green masses, studded purple white, like these; dream. I never saw otherwise, though I know do not believe me." "Dear Gertrude, I will believe anything like tell me, you will come home. I am sure I done wrong. You know I am always hard up, I declare I would give hundred pounds you would come home once. I do not believe there is gipsy within--" "Good-day, pretty young gentleman. Let poor gipsy girl tell fortune." He turned round saw Sybil standing his elbow, her eyes flashing her white teeth gleaming broad smile. He stood speechless sudden surprise; clergywoman, surprised, came forward her white hands stretched expressively towards Sybil's brown ones, gipsy girl took her own. "Please kindly tell me--do know anything young gipsy, named Christian?" The clergywoman spoke vehemence Sybil answered directly, "I know his grandmother"--and suddenly stopped herself. But she spoke, she turned her head expressive gesture direction encampment, without waiting more, clergywoman ran path, calling her cousin follow her. CHAPTER VII. My ancestor's artifice successful race run two sides hedge, backwards forwards; louis d'or bottle brandy depended reaching tinker-mother clergywoman, I lost wager. We hurried her, however, fast able, keeping well brushwood. When could see neighbours again, tinker-mother standing up, speaking hurriedly, wild look her eyes. "Let be, Sybil Stanley, let speak. I says again, fine folk coming worriting us wood? If I sell him, I sold fair--and I got back, I bought back fair. Aye delicate gentlewoman, may look me, I did! "Five years, five years wind weather, hard days lonely nights:-- "Five years food men would chuck pigs, clothes maids would think scorn scour in:-- "Five years--but I scraped together, _then_ baulked me. You shuts door poor tinker-woman's face; gives words warning police. "Five years--it five more, was not it, daughter?--Sometimes I fancies I makes mistake overcounts. But, _he'll_ know. Christian, dear! Christian, I say!" "Sit down, Mother, sit down," said gipsy girl; old woman sat down, she went muttering,-- "I speak! What do, I say, ask he gone to? A fine place fine gentleman made him. What say it, I could not keep I got him--that comes taunt grey hairs?" She wrung her grey locks passionate gesture she spoke, dropped her elbows her knees her head upon her hands. The clergywoman standing still, her two white hands folded her, her eyes, dark circles round made look large, fixed upon tinker-mother, she muttered; she ceased muttering clergywoman unlocked her hands, one movement took her hat. Her hair smoothly drawn roundness her head, gathered knot back her neck, brown streaked grey. She threw her hat grass, moving swiftly old woman's side, she knelt her, seen Sybil kneel, speaking clearly, and, touching tinker-mother's hand. "Christian's grandmother--you his grandmother, not?--you must much, much older me, look _my_ hair. Am I likely taunt one grown grey miserable? It takes good deal pain, good mother, make young hair white mine." "So should," muttered old woman, "so should. It plaguy world, I say, is; would plaguy past bearing poor, everything could likes never feel aches pains afterwards. And there is many fine gentlefolk thinks can, till feels difference. "'What is ten pound me?' says you. 'I wants pretty baby dark eyes long lashes,' says you. "'Them belongs poor, they would sell anything,' says you. "'I wants son,' says; 'and advantages gold silver, I buy one.' "You calls name choosing, puts name end that. His hands something dark son delicate white lady-mother, covered kid gloves gentility. "You buys fine clothes him, nurses tutors schools him. "You teaches speech gentlefolk, airs gentlefolk, learning gentlefolk. "You crams his head religion, thing I does not hold with, holy words, I thinks brings ill-luck. "You advantages silver gold, make fine gentleman him, blood flies his face he hears words insult gipsy blood, he comes back woods he born. "Let be, daughter, I say I speak--(Heaven keep head cool!)--it is good hear truth way. She is dainty fine lady, she taught many fine things, besides religion, I sets face against. Tell her she took mighty good care him--Ha! ha! old tinker-woman one chance teaching anything--_but she taught patteran_!" The clergywoman never moved, except tinker-mother shook her hand she locked her white fingers front her before, her eyes wandered old woman's face, looked beyond it, she I often done, counting bits blue sky show oak-leaves grow thick. But she must paying attention same, she spoke earnestly. "Good mother, listen me. If I bought him, sold him. Perhaps I wrong tempt you--perhaps I wrong hope buy GOD pleased give me. I young, one makes many mistakes one young. I thought I childless unhappy, I know childless children lost them. "Do know years son me, I think day I think you? I used wonder regretted him, I lived dread getting back; he ran away, I knew had. I never agreed lawyer's plans--my husband tell so--I always wanted find speak myself. I knew must feel, I thought I like know I knew it. "Night night I lay awake thought I would say met. I thought I would tell I could quite understand ways might become irksome Christian, he inherited love outdoor life, moving place place. I thought I would say perhaps I wrong ever taken away his people; done could undone, might perhaps make best together. I hope understand me, though say nothing? You see, he gipsy heart, he also brought many comforts cannot give him, habits ideas gentleman. You clever, fond him, mind speaking plainly. Now things gentleman might he money, would satisfy his love roving well. Many rich gentlemen dislike confinement houses domestic ways much Christian, leave fine homes travel among dangers discomforts. I could find money Christian by. If he likes wandering life, he live easily so--only he would able wander hundreds miles wander one, sleep skies among new flowers, forests woods shrubberies. He need fall bad ways know people tempted poor. I thought all, night night, longed able tell it. He might become famous traveller, know; he clever fond books adventure. This young gentleman tell so. How proud him! That I thought might hide me, I keep you. "And religion--dear good mother, listen me. Look me--see religion fashion plaything _me_. If stood heart heavy yours, profit I it? "Christian's grandmother--you his grandmother, I know, better right him--if cannot agree plans--if will not let help him--if hide me, I must live life never see his dear face again--spare hope seeing life over. "If I best grandson--and know I did--oh! love Christ, Refuge, stand Father us all! "If felt he must suffer he poor, know well little makes sure happiness rich--if long life found hard good, rare happy--if know love lose, hope disappointed one's hoping--let religious, good mother! "If care Christian, leave strength strong enough hold us back sin, instead joy." The tinker-mother lifted her head; she could say word, young gentleman burst indignant speech. "Gertrude, I bear longer. Not even you, even chance getting Christian back. It is empty swagger say I wish GOD I would chance giving life get back you. But must come home now. I have bitten lip holding tongue, I will not see kneel another minute feet sulky old gipsy hag." Whilst he speaking tinker-mother risen her feet, she stood quite upright she much taller I thought. The young gentleman moved take his cousin hand, old woman waved back. "Stay are, young gentleman," she said. "This matter boys mix meddle in. Sybil, daughter--Sybil, I say! Come stand near me, I gets confused times, I fears I may explain noble gentlewoman respect I could wish. She says great deal true, daughter, she vulgar insolence her manners speaking. I thinks I shall let her she says, get Christian out, perhaps, she cousin justiciary, she may able do. "The poor tinker-folk returns deepest obligations, gentle lady. If she will let see I wants to, best, daughter; I thinks I failing, I should not like leave George drunken slut. "I thinks I failing, I say. Trouble age lone company thoughts, noble gentlewoman, tendency confuse you, though I always highly esteemed facility speech, especially telling fortunes. "Let poor gipsy look white hand, pretty lady. The lines life somewhat broken trouble, joins peace. There is dark young gentleman great influence happiness, I sees grandchildren gathered knees. "What lady snatch away her hand for, daughter? I means offence. She shall Christian. I told her so. Tell get ready go his father gets back. He is bad 'un son George, I knows she far good him. "Come little nearer, dear, I may touch you. I sees face often, I knows cannot there, pleases able feel you. I afraid bore ill-will selling Christian; I bought back, dear, I bought back. Take away you, dear, I failing, I should not like leave George. Your eyes looks hollow hair grey. Not, I begrudges making much son, he treats ill, he treats ill. Do not cry, dear, comes end last, though I thinks sometimes men world put together worth love wastes upon one. You hear I say, Sybil? And rascal, Black Basil, worst bad lot." "Hold jaw, Mother," said Sybil sharply; she added, "Be pleased excuse her, lady: she old gets confused times, she thinks Christian's mother, dead." The old woman bursting again, Sybil raised her hand, pricked ears sound noisy quarrelling came nearer. "It is George his wife," said Sybil. "Mother, gentlefolks better go. I will go inn afterwards, tell Christian. Take lady away, sir. Come, Mother, come!" I have horror gipsy men, even neighbours dispersed I hustled away Mrs. Hedgehog bushes. CHAPTER VIII. Good Mrs. Hedgehog hurt one her feet slightly hurried retreat, next day obliged rest it; curiosity alert ever, I went afternoon tinker camp. The old woman sitting her usual position, she seemed recovered herself. Sybil leaning back tree opposite; she wore hat shawl, looked almost wild tinker-mother looked day before. She seemed inn clergywoman, telling tinker-mother result. "You told her he got two years, daughter? Does she say she get out?" "She says she power yourself, Mother--and young gentleman says same--unless--unless made known Christian innocent." "Two years," moaned old woman. "Is she sure could not buy out, dear? Two years--oh! Christian, child, I shall never live see again!" She sobbed minute, raising her hand suddenly her head, she cried, "A curse Black--" Sybil seized her wrist suddenly, checked her words. "Do not curse him, Mother," said gipsy girl, "and I will--I will see I do. I meant to, I have come say good-bye. I have brought packet tea you; see keep yourself. Good-bye, Mother." "Good-evening, daughter." "I said good-bye. You do not hold religion, you?" "I not, far, daughter; though I think young clergywoman speaks convincingly it." "Do not think may better world, Mother, tries right, though things goes here?" "I think might easily better world, dear, I never instructed it." "You do not believe prayers, you, Mother?" "That I not, daughter. Christian said lots  them, sees comes to." "It is unlucky say 'GOD bless you,' it, Mother? I wanted say I go." "No, daughter, I does not object that, I regards old-fashioned compliment, nature good manners holy words." "GOD bless you, Mother." "GOD bless you, daughter." Sybil turned round walked steadily away. The last glimpse I her she turned more, put hair her face look old woman: tinker-mother see her, she muttering her head upon her hands. * * * * * It remarkable summer--that summer I seven, took much interest neighbours. I make point never disturbing events by-gone seasons. At time, rear family seven urchins thing done hedgehog-parents every year, careers family clearly impressed upon memory. Number one came sad end. What face wood made think pheasants' eggs, I cannot conceive. I am sure I never said anything them! It whilst he scrambling along edge covert, he met Fox, properly rolled ball. The Fox's nose long his own, he rolled poor son it, till he rolled stream. The young urchins swim like fishes, he scrambling shore, Fox caught waistcoat killed him. I hate slyness! Numbers two three flitted. I told so, young people go way. They excellent victuals. Number four (my eldest daughter) settled comfortably life, family three. She might sent burdocks pick snails quite well, she would take walking her instead. They picked (all four them) two long-legged Irish boys, put basket took home. I think young gentlemen meant harm, provided plenty food, took bed them. They set daughter liberty next day, she spoke handsomely young gentlemen, said cured skins saltpetre, stuffing she left. But subject always awkward one. Number five still living. He best hand fight snake I know. Numbers six seven went Covent Garden hamper. They say black-beetles excellent eating. The whole seven narrow escape lives Sybil left us. They over-ate snails, Mrs. Hedgehog stay home nurse them. I kept eye neighbours brought her news. "Christian come home," I said, one day. "The Queen given pardon." "Then he _did_ take pheasants' eggs?" said Mrs. Hedgehog. "Certainly not," said I. "In first place was not eggs, second place Black Basil took whatever was, he confessed it." "Then Christian did not it, he forgiven?" said Mrs. Hedgehog. "I cannot tell you," said I; "but is. And he moment clergywoman tinker-mother." "Where Sybil?" asked Mrs. Hedgehog. I know then, I clear her now. I never saw her again, either I heard she married Black Basil, gone across water country woods bigger here, I dreamt one winter naps. I inclined think must true, I always regarded Sybil somewhat proud unsociable, I think she would like big wood neighbours. But really one sleeps several months stretch easy accurate one's dreams.

But I suppose people--cats otherwise--are consulted names. If were, would perhaps be, rule, appropriate. What qualities mind body name supposed illustrate, I hour notion. I distinctly remember stage kittenhood, I thought Toots English cream. "Toots! Toots!" young mistress used say, suggestive tones, creeping I would creep mouse, saucerful delicious liquid her hand. "Toots first-rate stuff," I used think, I purred accordingly, I never ungrateful cat. This dining-room, morning. Later day, "Toots" served drawing-room. It two periods, I remember, one day I found larder. Why I went there, puzzled time; anything I hate chill, horrid draught window pierced tiny holes, seemed let separate blast every hair one's fur. I followed cook, true; I follow cook rule--not, instance, she went coal-hole yard. I slipped her dress. I behind potato-tub she went out, shutting door her. For mysterious reason I felt tip-claw expectation. My nose twitched agreeable sensations. An inward voice seemed murmur, _Toots_! Regardless draughts, I sprang shelf close window. And dish cream! The saucers one got breakfast hold twentieth part brimming pan contained. As five of the clock china, visitors give tepid teaspoonful, bits old tea-leaves it--I grinned thought I drew tongueful tongueful thick yellow cream. At moment I heard young mistress's voice distant passages. "Toots, Toots!" said she. "I have got plenty," purred I, lifting head speak, great effort. "Toots, Toots!" she miowed on, she was not much quicker-witted rest her race. "No, thank you," thought I; "and want five of the clock toots yourself, I advise come it." I thought this, speak I really could not--I busy lapping. It delicious stuff! But dish three-parts empty, I began feel I good deal, wish I appetite rest. "It is shame leave it, though," I thought, "when laps empty dish." For I come ancient rough-tongued cat family, always lick platters clean. So I set work again, though draught annoying, froze cream butter whiskers. I polishing glazed earthenware family skill, I became conscious house resounding cry "Toots!" "Toots, Toots!" squeaked housemaid, servants' hall. "Toots, Toots!" growled elderly butler, pantry. "Toots, Toots, cock-a-Toots!" yelled intolerable creature, Macaw. "Toots, Toots!" snapped cook. "Miow," said I; I finished cream, could speak now, though I confess I feel equal great exertion. The cook opened door. She found me--she find cream, she left dish ready whipping. Perhaps she cream whip, she tried whip me. Certainly, next half-hour, I reason much confused meaning word "Toots." In soft voice mistress always seemed mean cream; seemed mean kicks, blows, flapping dish-cloths, wash-leathers dusters, pokers, carpet brooms, every instrument torture poor cat could chased garret cellar. I pretty nimble, though I never felt less disposed violent exercise, I flatter I led good dance before, sudden impulse affectionate trustfulness, I sprang straight mistress's arms shelter. "You must beat him, miss," gasped cook, "or there will never bearing house. Every drop lovely cream gone, half sweets ball supper throwed completely calculation!" "Naughty Toots, naughty Toots, naughty Toots!" cried young lady, every "Toots" she gave slap; her paws claws them, I offended hurt. This first lesson honesty, also beginning train reasoning mind, I came understand people called "Toots" meant me. And as--to justice--they generally called kind intention, I made point responding name. Indeed, kind me, position comfortable one, lean tabby called one day charitable subscription, begged contribute spare partridge bones fund support starving cats neighbourhood, deserted families leaving town, I said really cases much line. There great deal imposition about--perhaps cats stolen cream, had not left stealing chased family. I doubted families cats deserved respect consideration ever leave town. One many calls, one begins subscribe things; I particularly fond partridge. But when, months later, words lean tabby spoken passed butler cook reference household, I learnt "the family" going "to leave town," I felt pang conscience, wished I subscribed merry thought, even breast-bone--there little it--to Deserted Cats' Fund. But young mistress told (with regrets caresses, circumstances mere mockery) I left behind. I particularly placid temper, adapt pretty comfortably ups downs life; news made tail stand end. "Poor dear Toots!" said mistress, kissing nose, tickling gently ear, she saying prettiest things possible. "I _so_ sorry! I do not know _what_ you! But going abroad, _can't_ take you, dear old thing! We have heaps luggage, lots servants, end things _must_ go! But I _can't bear think_ left behind!" "No," said I indignantly; "that is it, people number ten, number fourteen, number twenty-five, could not bear think would become cats, went away did not think it. They could not bear see die, did not give dose quick poison, left die starvation, were not see. You are heartless, selfish race, human beings, I suspect Mrs. Tabby shabby-looking, true-hearted soul, pester people subscriptions patch dreary end existence deserted pets, caressing days over. Fuff!" And I jumped straight her arms, whisked dining-room window. For time I strolled thoughtfully along top area railings. I rather hoped I might see Mrs. Tabby. I wondered her subscription list getting on. I felt difference lady's interest Reduced Gentlewomen's Benevolent Institution Poor Annuitants' Home, she well wealthy, lady's interest turn Misfortune's wheel left her "dependent her exertions." It seemed I left dependent exertions--and thoughts turned naturally Mrs. Tabby Deserted Cats' Fund. But sign good creature! At moment hansom cab rattled up, gentleman got rang front-door bell. As he got cab, I jumped railings, rubbed his legs--he long legs. "Halloa, Toots! you?" said he kindly voice, always attractions me, present mood particularly grateful. His hat set well back his head, I could clearly see friendly expression his countenance. Suddenly he tilted his nose, I observed he apt struck new idea. "Toots!" said he abruptly, "what going you?" Blessings kind friend! say I; friend encumber responsibility thinking what is become you, world. Those tender-hearted souls cannot bear think misfortunes much numerous part one's acquaintance. A ray hope began dawn upon me. Perhaps new even luxurious home offered acceptance. In foolish panic I begun identify needy classes society? A cat stripes style! Once I thought benevolent institutions patronizing point view. But I would patron, generous one. The shock _had_ done much! And next time Mrs. Tabby called I would _pick lot best bones Fund_. Meanwhile, I went back railings, took flying leap, perched gentleman's shoulder. I could hardly managed ground, he long legs. I think, bye, I mentioned before. I wish repeat myself, dwell grievance, though, his legs shorter, his riding-boots would long, I might moment know became of--but I must forestall story. I jumped gentleman's shoulder. In so, I knocked his hat one eye. But I seen since then, he made complaint. The man-servant opened door, went house together. CHAPTER II. I flatter head remarkable size beauty alone. I cat mind, I made course conduct pursue. I also cat powers observation, I observed two things go long way men--flattery persistence. Also difficulty coaxing direct proportion size--rather reverse. Another thing I observed is, want well-treated, favour ask, great thing good coat back good order. How many human sleeked rich softness magnificent tiger skin, said, perfect good faith, "How Toots enjoys stroked!" "How enjoy feel fur, mean," I tempted say. But I say it. It does not disturb self-complacency people control milk-jug. Having made mind coax gentleman adopting me, I devoted entirely evening, ignored rest party, serenely cat knows how. Again he put firm, ungentle hands, saying--"Go down, Toots," pick stray hairs fidgety manner his dress-trousers; I return his shoulder (where he could not see hairs) purr his ear, rub long whiskers his short ones. But till he comfortably established arm-chair drawing-room fire, round rest family also seated, charm began work. "How devoted Toots you!" purred ladies, ineffectual effort part share arm-chair. "You are foolish Toots," said gentleman. (I back his shoulder time.) "Toots, you have deserted me," said young mistress. "I am quite jealous," she added. "Toots, brute!" cried gentleman, seizing hands. "Where is good taste, gratitude? Go mistress, sir," he threw her lap. But I sprang back his shoulder one leap. "It is really extraordinary," said one lady. "And Toots never goes strangers rule," added mistress. Everybody proud _exceptionally_ favoured. It last stroke, I convinced, rubbed right way. A gratified blandness pervaded his countenance. He made attempts dislodge me, I settled angles his shoulder affected go sleep. "What going him?" he asked, crossing one long leg convulsive abruptness trying balance, strength arm-chair. Both ladies began mew. They _so_ sorry leave behind, _quite_ impossible take me. They could not bear think unhappy, did not know world find home. "I wish _you_ would take him!" said mistress. I listened breathlessly gentleman's reply. "Pets least line," he said. "I bachelor, know, tidy habits. I dislike trouble, rooted objection encumbrances." "We hear pet mouse, though," said mistress. He laughed awkwardly. "My dear young lady, I never said practice always squared principles. Helpless troublesome creatures sometimes insinuating way them, forms additional reason avoiding them, especially one weak-minded. And----" "And _have_ pet mouse?" He sat suddenly upright another jerk, nearly shot fire-place, said, "I will tell it, upon word I wish could see little beggar. It one afternoon I came riding, I found mouse sitting fender. I could see his back, tail twitching, I noticed piece bitten his left ear. The little wretch must heard quite well, he sat place belonged him. "'You are pretty cool!' I said; rather reverse myself, I threw Queen's Regulations him, he disappeared. But bothered me, I hate mice one's quarters. You never know mischief may not doing. You put valuable papers carefully away, next time go cupboard, reduced shreds. The little brutes take lining slippers line nests. They keep awake night--in short, they are detestable. But I fond killing things myself, though I have sort conscience knowing it is done. I do not like leaving necessary executions servants. As mice, know--poisoning question, sanitary grounds. 'Catch- them-alive' traps like policeman catches pickpocket--all trouble prosecution come; traps springs spikes--my man set one bedroom once, middle night mouse caught. For nearly hour I doubt I much happier two. Every moment I thought poor wretch would stop screaming, I ordered trap belief death instantaneous. At last I jumped up, put whole concern tub held water. The poor beast dead six seconds. A catch- them-alive trap tub water merciful death, I fancy; I rather favour letting one animal kill another. It seems natural, _fairer_. They run lives, speak." "And get kill mouse?" "Well, I know youngster terrier. They perfect pair. As like two peas, equally keen sport--they would go twenty miles chase bluebottle round attic, sooner hunt something. So I told mouse _de trop_ rooms, he promised bring Nipper next morning. I going hunting myself. "The meet early, man got breakfast seven of the clock quarters; first thing I saw I came bedroom mouse sitting edge Indian silver sugar-basin. I knew his ear. And he sat breakfast-time, twitching his tail, nibbling little bits sugar, watching pair eyes! Have ever seen mouse's eyes close? Upon word, wonderfully beautiful, it is uncommonly difficult hurt creature fine eyes. I did not touch it, I going I looked back, _the mouse looking me_. I fool looking back, I cannot stand pitiful expression man beast, put end Nipper's sport, left mouse quarters--a thing I hate. I did not like say I would changed mind killing mouse, I wrote Nipper's master, said I would not trouble come trifling matter." "So mouse safe?" "Well, _I_ thought so. But young fellow (who good-natured) wrote back say trouble whatever, letter lay mantel-piece till I came home found he Nipper broken chair-leg, two china plates." "_Did_ kill mouse?" "Well, no. But I nearly killed Nipper saving him; little rascal lived ever since." The ladies seemed highly delighted anecdote, but, part, I felt feverish tips claws, I thought miserable creature usurped place I wished fill, might means fall back Deserted Cats' Fund. What bungling puss her paws, allowed escape torn ear wariness experience? Let catch sight twitching tail!---- At moment gentleman got up, stretched his long---- But I _not_ allude them! It annoys much thought bungling cat, Nipper's baulked attempt. He put his hands lifted his shoulder, heart sank he said, "If I catch train, I fear I must say good-bye." I believe that, hopeless crisis, fur usual favour. He rubbed his cheek mine putting down, said, "And you have told me, all, poor Toots really going." "We found home yet, I assure you," said mistress. "Our washerwoman wants him, she kind-hearted respectable person, she got nine children, and----" "Nine children!" ejaculated friend, "My poor Toots, inch magnificent tail left end week. What cruelty animals! Upon word, I would almost rather take Toots myself, think washerwoman nine children. Eh, Toots! would like come?" I carpet, rubbing his--yes, long short, _his_, he kind me!--rubbing, I say, his legs. I could get impetus spring, I scrambled straight one would scramble tree (my grandmother bird-catcher first talent, I inherit her claws), uttered one pitiful mew. The gentleman gave short laugh, took his arms. "Oh, _how_ good you! Jones shall get hamper," cried ladies. But he shook his head. "Three fourteen parcels I have got pick station hampers. I would not another mind fortune. If Toots comes all, he must come like Christian look himself." I dwell departure. It sadly flurried one, cat temperament. The ladies saw us off, young mistress covered farewell kisses, I felt unquestionable pang regret. But one repress one's affections, consider one's prospects life, one want come upon Deserted Cats' Fund! My master put his hat back his head steps, knocked shouting hole roof cab drive like wind, late. At last moment several things thrown us. A parcel books he lent young lady, pair boots he left behind former occasion. The books neatly packed, addressed, boots came "like Christians, looked themselves." And all, I clung fast, blessed inherited vigour grandmother's claws. At parcels office, I certainly risked nine lives among fourteen parcels dragged pitched, turned every direction; though he paid attention, master never forgot put back hand help moved on. Eventually found alone comfortable carriage, I suppose fourteen packages safe too, thanks desperate struggles five porters, went clutching paws satisfied result. After incommoding time rustling newspapers, making spasmodic struggles find posture suited him, master found one last fell asleep, I crept velvet collar his great-coat followed his example. CHAPTER III. I like living bachelors. They comfortable chairs, keep good fires. They do not put water tea-pot: call man-servant send tea. They do not give table-spoonful cream, fidgeting looking round see anybody else wants it: one turns jug upside-down saucer, another lay hold say, "Halloa! The milk's gone,"--you generally time lap table. I prefer men's outsides, too, women's respects. Why human beings--since coats own, obliged buy them--do buy handsomely marked furs whilst it, puzzle cat. As miserable stuff ladies cover evening, much comfort softness going sleep duster. Men's coats nothing boast of, either look feel, _are_ thicker. If happen clutch little gratification excitement, claws do not go through; do not squeak like mouse trap call treacherous coats thin. I comfortable new home. My master exceedingly kind me, he fearless friendly way tickling one's toes particularly agreeable, commonly met with. Yes, life even luxurious before. It still. To eat, drink, sleep, keep oneself warm, good condition, pay proper attention one's personal appearance; one life like mine bachelors' quarters. One unpleasant dreams sometimes. I think tea occasionally strong, though I learned prefer milk, master always gives his saucer. If he friends tea, give saucers. One cannot refuse, I fancy much tea injurious nerves. The night last, I positively dreamed I deserted. I fancied I chased along housetop, fell gutter. Down--down--but I woke bear-skin fire, man-servant bringing candles. It made wonder Mrs. Tabby getting on. I never done anything matter; really one's life goes certain groove, everything one wish provided abundance, one never seems time things. It wonderful energetic philanthropic people are. I dare say like fuss. (I cannot endure fuss!) And Mrs. Tabby's appearance--excellent creature!--would probably make her feel ill-at-ease bachelor quarters, could change places. Her fur really almost mangy, she nothing speak way tail. But she worthy soul. And day, Captain I going town without much luggage--or she happen collecting country,--I certainly _look worst bones Fund_. I really hesitate approach subject one source discontent. It seems strange crook lot smooth ours. Plenty eat drink, handsome coats, encumbrances, temperament naturally inclined--at least, case--towards taking life easy. And yet, I lay stretched full-length one master's knees night, delicious fire, saucerful creamy tea he could drink himself--I kept waking uncomfortable starts, fancying I saw edge fender--but I tell matter proper order. I turned round get back it, I thought same; every hair moustaches twitched, vexation thoughts, I observed master pulling biting his, glaring fire _he_ expected see--however, I trouble crumples _his_ rose-leaves. He big enough take care himself. My grievance I state plainly once. It may relief mind, I sometimes fear unhinged dwelling thought of--but begin. It easily understood arrival new home, I waited anxiously appearance mouse; hardly credited one knows me, knew grandmother, I saw _let escape me_. It seated sugar-basin, Captain described it. The torn ear, jerking tail, bright eyes--all there. If story falls paws young cat wishes avoid mortifications embittered favoured existence, let warn remember creature lived friendly terms human beings cannot judged common rules. Many mouse's eye bright one I seen, hitherto never one paralyze own. He looked me--I looked him. His tail jerked--mine responded. Our whiskers twitched--joy filled brain intoxication--I crept--I crouched--I sprang-- He spell-bound--he even run away. With cool twinkle hateful eye, one twitch ragged ear, he overbalanced silver sugar-pot dropped ground, basin sugar falling top crash made start will. I think start baulked lightning flash second leap, he gone--absolutely gone. To add insult injury, master ran his bedroom shouted--"Stealing, Toots? confound you, you have knocked sugar-pot," threw his hair-brushes me. _I_ steal?--and, worse still, _I_ knock anything, walked among three dozen wine-glasses, shelf butler's pantry, without making jingle! But I must calm, tell. The mouse never returned. It something, enough. My pride deeply hurt, demanded revenge. At last I felt almost grievance I _did_ reign supreme Captain's quarters, mouse come back--and let catch him. Besides in-door man, master Irish groom, groom place (something saddle-room scullery) _he_ said he "kept master required," where, master said, Terence kept wanted, lost was. There certainly were, knowledge, fifteen empty Day Martin's blacking-bottles one corner, I used occasionally walk keep feet practice, room Terence last conscious possession hunting-breeches never seen Captain's birthday, Terence threw clothes-brush me, I would drink master's health whisky, take cleanest shoe brushes his coat, dusty lying corn-chest. But he good-natured creature, then, change, I followed saddle-room. I thankful say I never caught mice except amusement, cat daintier tastes exist. But one inherited instincts--and musty, fusty, mousey smell room excite little. Besides, I practised steps among blacking-bottles. I top tottering part pile one afternoon, I saw pair bead-like eyes, and--yes, I could swear it--a torn ear. But I could spring ground vanished behind corn-chest. This came Captain's room cosiest, he his friends kindest, I used steal away luxuries dear every fibre constitution, pat hastily dirty hole, Terence accumulated old rubbish misused mislaid valuables--in wild hope I might hear, smell, see ragged-eared enemy peace. What hours I wasted, blinking sleep, alert sounds like revelries mocking mice. When I say I even risked wet feet, damp afternoon, get there--every cat understand wild must infatuation! I tried reason it. "Toots," I would say, "you banished master's room, probably banished Terence's. Why pursue matter farther? So pitiful object unworthy revenge." "Very true," I would reply myself, "but I want turn air. I will step far saddle-room more, make finally comfortable looking behind old barrel. I do not think I went quite round it." There delusion strong besets you, complete failure results--as hope getting relief infatuation indulging more. It grows worse every time. One day I stealing away usual, I caught master's eye peculiar expression it. He gnawing his moustaches too. I fond him, I ran back chair looked mewed, I wanted know matter. "You are curious cat, Toots," said he; "but I suppose you are like rest world. I think care little bit me. It is cream, it, old fellow? As companion, prefer Terence? Eh? Well, you!" But I need hardly say I would leave him. It want love led saddle-room. I base enough forget he friend need, even he less amiable since. All evening I lay his breast slept. _But I dreamt mouse!_ The next morning he went riding. "He miss now," thought I. "I devote morning hunting wretched room inch inch, last time. It satisfy mouse there, really duty try convince this, I may cured infatuation causes annoyance excellent master." I hurried rapidly befitted vigour resolution, I got saddle-room I saw mouse. And mouse saw he fled like wind. I confess I lost then, hole he reckoned stopped up, he turn. What chase was! Never I meet his equal audacity fleetness. But I knew holes well he did, cut every one. Round round went--behind barrel, corn-chest, he made middle room. Now, amongst rubbish Terence collected him, many old articles clothing belonging Captain, including pair long riding-boots, gathering mildew, stiffening shape present position ever since I came. One lying floor; I upon mouse, he darted boot. A quiver delight ran me. With his unwonted sagacity, Master Mouse run straight trap. The boot wide, head shoulders I plunged prey. I scented way leg, painful fact I could quite get bottom. He must crouched toe heel, I could get farther calf. Oh, master's legs two inches shorter! I clawed remotest corner foot. As was, I pushed, I struggled, I shook, I worried wretched boot--but vain. Only I choked I withdraw head gasp fresh air. And Captain himself, yelling laughter, sprawling place convulsions unseemly merriment, long legs which--but his fault, poor man! * * * * * That story--an unfinished tale, I know end. This one crook luxurious lot--that I cannot see last mouse. Happily, I do not think master longer misunderstands attachment saddle-room. The day, he sat scribbling long time pencil paper, he done it, he threw sketch said, "There, Toots, look that, see became friend!" It civilly meant, I append sketch sake may inform. I understand pictures myself. Those boots strange fascination now. I sit hours mouth one he went never came back. Not faintest squeak recesses ever stirred sensitive hairs watchful ear. He must starving, nibble leather I heard. I doze, I ever alert. Nightmares occasionally disturb me. I fancy I see him, made desperate hunger, creep anxiously mouth boot, pricking his tagged ear. Once I terrible vision his escaping, his tail vanished round corner. But dreams. He never returned, I suspect truth is, he fit fright, toe boot, dead. Some day Terence shake his skeleton. It grows cold. This place full draughts, floor damp. He _must_ dead. He never could lasted long without move nibble. And tea-time. I think I shall join Captain. THE HENS OF HENCASTLE. (_Translated German of_ VICTOR BLÜTHGEN.) What hot, drowsy afternoon was. The blazing sun shone glare upon farmyard almost unbearable, vestige grass green thing relieve eye cast little shade. But fowls back yard disturbed heat least bit world, plenty time doze, fond taking _siesta_ hottest place could found. Certainly hottest place afternoon, far, yard reposed. There five them--a cock four hens. Two hens renowned throughout whole village, wore tufts feathers heads instead usual red combs; cock proud distinguished-looking wives. Besides which, he naturally stately bird appearance, splendid blackish-green tail golden speckled hackle, shone glistened sun. He also many sharp battles certain young cocks neighbourhood, curiosity tufted foreigners attracted yard. The consequence triumphs he held undisputed dominion far second fence farmyard, whenever he shut his eyes sounded his war-clarion, whole his rivals made fast wings legs could carry them. So five sat stood yard, dozing sunshine, felt bored. During middle day managed get winks sleep, farmer's men began thresh barn close by, making noise enough wake dead, small chance well-organized fowls able sleep din. "I wish one would tell story," said one common hens, she ruffled her feathers end, shook straight again, coolness. "I tired scrabbling dust, fly-catching amusement suited sparrows vulgar birds." This hit one foreign hens, wandered away little pecking flies wall. The two common hens fond vexing foreign ones, feelings hurt reckoned less beautiful rare. The tufted fair one heard remark, called spitefully distance: "If certain people ignorant country bumpkins, would able tell good story themselves." "That remark cannot apply me, I know great number stories," replied common hen, turning her head one side show her contempt. "For instance: upon time hen laid nothing soft-shelled eggs--" "You cannot mean _me_ story," said tufted one, "for I laid one soft-shelled egg whole life. So there! But tell interesting story ends--I anxious hear end." "You know best yourself," retorted other. "Now I am sure, dear Father Cock, could tell us something really amusing would kind," said second common hen, standing near him. "Those two make one's life burthen, everlasting wrangling bickering." "Hush!" said cock, standing motionless one leg air, attitude he often assumed hard thinking done; "I trying recollect one." After pause, he said solemn voice: "I tell terrible tale troubles 'The Hens Hencastle.' "Once upon time--it village fair week, when, know, every one eats drinks much he possibly can, consequently great many animals killed,--the farmer's cook came fowlyard, carefully looking chickens, remarked seven would twisting merrily spit next morning. On hearing this, fowls plunged deepest despair, one felt sure he would seven, one could guess victims would chosen. Two young cockerels, deep perplexity, last went yard-dog, Flaps name, great friend theirs, cackled woes. "'Why stop here?' asked Flaps. 'If pluck would run away.' "'Ah! Perhaps so--but enough courage desperate step?' sighed young cockerels. 'Why, courageous we, else stop chained day, allow tiresome children come tease you?' "'Well,' replied dog, 'I earn good livelihood putting small discomforts, besides that, _I_ going set twisting spit. However, particularly wish it, go away somewhere together; do, I may well tell once, feed me.' "The cockerels, fired bold advice, betook henroost courage young lions; short animated discussion, persuaded whole cocks hens run away take Flaps protector community. "When darkness fell, dog unchained night usual, soon coast seemed clear, he went henhouse, pushed back sliding door his nose, let out. "Then he whole company stole away quietly possible yard-gate, away open country. "The fowls flew wandered on, livelong night, perfectly happy freedom, feeding sheaves corn stood stubble-fields. "Whenever Flaps felt hungry, hens laid couple eggs he found far nicer barley-meal dog-biscuit. "When passed thinly-populated places likely observed, marched gaily forward; whenever chance danger, travelled night. "Meanwhile cook went early morning kill chickens; finding whole place empty Mother Hubbard's cupboard, she fell violent fit hysterics, kitchen-maid pig-boy put her pump, work hard quarter hour could revive her. "After days' journeying, wanderers arrived large desolate-looking heath, middle stood old weather-beaten house, apparently uninhabited. Flaps sent forward examine it, he searched garret cellar without finding trace human being. The fowls examined neighbourhood two whole days nights like result, determined take abode dwelling. "In trooped, set work turn strong castle, well fortified danger. They stopped holes cracks tufts grass, piled wall big little stones right round house. When repairs completed called Hencastle. "During autumn fowls ventured forth cornfields lay near haunts men, collected store grain supply food winter. They kept floor loft, spring came sowed remainder stock field, produced abundant crop plenty provisions following winter. "Thus lived peaceful happy life, uneventful history; Mark, watchman, always stood coping-stone highest chimney act sentinel, used constantly fall asleep, partly sheer boredom, partly combined effects old age, good living, nothing earth do. Flaps, too, undertaken guard castle intruders, first used patrol house carefully inside every night, soon came conclusion game worth candle. "One chilly evening, time first snows, wind beginning whistle heath make strange noises castle, two old hens loft chat picking stray grains corn supper. All sudden heard mysterious 'Piep.' 'Hollo!' said one, 'what is that? one hatching time year--it is impossible; yet surely something said "Piep" corner.' "Just another 'Piep' heard. "'I do not think sounds _quite_ like young chicken,' replied hen. "In middle discussion knotty point, descried couple mice edge corn-heap. One sitting his hind-legs, washing his ears whiskers his fore-paws, his wife gobbling corn rapid rate, sight wise far-seeing old hens discerned probability future troubles. "'Hollo there! that is corn,' cried; 'you must not steal it. Of course may grains depth winter keep starving; remember, spring comes again, sort thing must stop, must go away never come more.' "'Piep,' said mice, vanished. "The two hens told rest happened, nobody troubled insignificant matter, said poor old things made mountains molehills. Anyhow, two days everybody, including wise hens themselves, forgotten it. Later on, winter, mice seven young ones--seven skinny, thread-limbed, beady-eyed little beasts one noticed arrival. "Very soon after, almost hen time look round think, behold! mice squeaking every corner, holes behind every wainscot, plank, rafter. "A year passed away, winter returned mice came took stored corn away quantities everybody saw none would left sow spring. "Matters come crisis; many anxious discussions held amongst fowls, good counsel thing much sought Hencastle. "At first took energetic measures, many mouse fell victim well-aimed peck cock's beak; alas! mice took energetic measures also, resisted death, many fowl's leg bitten bone. Much said, much done, mice numerous before. "The commonwealth decided sending three experienced cocks world, try find means getting rid plague mice. "The cocks journeyed one whole day without finding anything help trouble, towards evening came wild, rocky mountainside, full caves clefts, made minds stay night; crept hole ledge rock, put heads wings, went sleep. "In middle night roused sound flapping wings, followed whispering voice, saying, 'whish--ish,' soon broke loud 'Whoo--hoo! whoo--hoo!' They popped heads hole see matter, perceived great owl sitting stump, flapping wings down, rolling great round eyes about, glared like red-hot coals head. "'Mice here! Mice here! Whoo--hoo!' shrieked. "On hearing cocks nudged one another, said, 'We luck's way last.' Then owl still continued call mice, one plucked courage addressed it: 'If come us, sir, shall many mice eat--a whole house-full, like.' "'Who may be?' hissed owl, glared fiery eyes cleft. "'We come Hencastle, hundreds mice, devour corn day night. "'Whoo--hoo! I will come, I will come,' screamed owl, snapping beak pleasure. "In grey dawn fowls sat roof-tree, listening Mark, watchman, stood top of, his chimney, cried, "'What I see? Here come three! And them, I reckon, A bird neck on.' "Thereupon owl three messengers flew rush top castle. "'Ha! ha! I smell mice,' shrieked new comer, dashed hole roof, whence shortly reappeared mouse claws. "This sight filled fowls joy; sat edge roof row, nudged other, remarked, "'This indeed happy venture.' "For days everything went smoothly possible, time mice began find owl could see really well night, saw badly day, hardly midday sun shining window loft. So came noon, dragged enough corn away holes last till following day. "One night owl catch single mouse, so, hungry, drove beak hen's eggs lay corner, ate them. Finding taste fattest mouse, much less trouble catch, henceforth owl gave mouse-hunting, took egg-poaching. This fowls presently discovered, three wise cocks sent tell owl go away, longer use anybody, never caught mice ate eggs. "'Whoo--hoo! whoo--hoo! More eggs--give eggs, I will scratch eyes out,' shrieked owl, began whet beak beam savage manner three cocks fled terror top chimney. "Having somewhat recovered alarm, went told Flaps, basking sunshine, owl must got rid of. "'What, mice eaten, then?' inquired he. "'Alas!' answered one cocks, 'the brute eat nothing eggs now, threatens scratch eyes do not supply many wants.' "'Wait till noonday,' said dog, 'and I will soon bring rascal reason.' "At twelve of the clock Flaps quietly pushed door open went loft. There sat old owl winking blinking corner. "'So robber going scratch people's eyes out,' said Flaps. 'For must die!' "'That remains seen,' sneered owl; 'but eyes I have, dogs' eyes too!' swooped upon Flaps' head; old dog seized bird his teeth killed it, though one his eyes scratched struggle. "'No matter,' said Flaps; 'I have done duty, rate, I do not know I want one eye see with;' saying, he went back his post. "The fowls made great feast, lasted whole day, celebrate owl's death. "But mice remained castle, continued increase multiply. So three wise cocks go forth second voyage discovery, order try find remedy intruders. "They flew night day without result; towards morning, second day, alighted rest thick wood, there, one forest glades, sun rising, saw red-coated animal watching mouse-hole. It fox, come find something breakfast. They soon saw catch mouse eat it, heard say, 'Heaven praised small mercies! I managed secure light breakfast last, though I have hunting night vain.' "'Do hear that?' said one messengers. 'He considers lucky caught single mouse. That is sort animal want.' "So cock called tree--'I say! there! Mr. Mouse-eater! whole loft-full long-tailed vermin that, come us. But must first solemnly swear never eat eggs instead mice.' "'Nothing earth shall ever tempt touch egg. I swear solemnly,' said fox, staring tree. 'But whence come, worthy masters?' "'We live Hencastle, one knows except mice, eat us house home.' "'You do not say so,' said fox below, licking his lips. 'And many handsome, magnificent birds are, Hencastle?' "'Why, course, whole place full them.' "'Then I will come you,' said fox, lowering his eyes, lest cocks discern hungry look them. 'And thousand mice loft, shall soon lick dust. Ah! do not know delicious dainties such--mice--are.' "This time fowls wait till evening heard Mark, watchman, crowing his chimney, calling forth, "'Here come three! But I see? Why, friend bring Is four-legged thing.' "When fox got outer wall, he sniffed uneasily said, "'I smell dog, I fond race, rule like me.' "'You need alarmed,' replied cocks; 'there one here--our friend Mr. Flaps,--and he always stationed outside castle; besides, he glad come kill mice.' "But spite assurance, fox like idea going past Flaps, stood door, showing his teeth, hair his back standing end; last, catching sight number plump young chickens looking window, Reynard could resist longer, his mouth watering anxiety among them, he slipped past Flaps like lightning, scampered loft. Once there, he behaved affably fowls, especially oldest influential hens, soon every one looked friend time need, enthusiasm brought climax saw catch four mice half many minutes. "In dead night, asleep, Reynard crept fowls roosted, finding youngest fattest perched, he snapped heads couple even time flutter feather. He carried window, opened gently, dropped dead bodies ground beneath, sped away house-door bolted it. "When he done this, he returned old hens woke groaning heartbreaking manner, fowls crowded round know amiss. "'Alas!' cried he, 'it sad lot witness fearful sight. That dog keep guard house slipped door, going corner lovely young chickens roost, quicker thought killed two beautiful angels. I chasing mouse stairs time, happened come dreadful deed done, I saw robber making his booty. Only come minute, shall see I spoken truth.' "He took scared frightened fowls window, looked out, saw horror guardian Flaps sniffing dead bodies ground outside. "'Who would thought it!' said hens, awe-stricken whisper. "'You may thank me,' said fox, 'for presence mind bolting house-door he ran out, one knows many he would killed! If take advice, send his business; put his place, I assure shall protected quite another manner.' "'Hi! open door,' cried Flaps, saw something wrong; 'you have got another King Stork, I will bound.' But though he rattled shook door, one unbolted it. 'Ah!' sighed Flaps, 'before long whole pack idiots killed eaten.' So he scratched open old hole wall stopped up, crept in. He arrived time hear old hens giving orders eggs given him, door kept bolted, order he might obliged either leave place starve. "They talking once, eagerly, one noticed dog come behind them. He gave one spring seized fox throat. The attack quite unexpected, fox fought, writhed, wriggled like eel, he borne down, he made one desperate snap, bit dog's ear close head. "'Well, ear done for, blood-thirsty villain,' said Flaps, looking fox, lay dead his feet; 'and you, pack ungrateful fools, one ear quite enough listen with. Here I faithful comrade years, yet believe I turned murderer old age word rogue, evil deed last night.' "Now panic over, fowls felt heartily ashamed deceived fox, done Flaps great injustice. So asked his pardon, feast held celebrate deliverance fox even magnificent last, went two whole days. "Hencastle _en fête_ time, short time. For mice less glad fowls enemy dead; he owl disappeared, came fearlessly hours day, lived life quite free trouble care. "Not fowls. What done ever-increasing colony corn-stealers? The fowls meditated, mice squeaked played about, corn dragged away holes. There even rumour one meddled eggs. "There nothing dispatch three messengers third time, directions vigilant careful before. Away flew, farther ever. The first chance help arose couple cats kite, seemed likely perform required work, cocks declined accept aid, feeling Hencastle suffered much already two-winged four-legged protectors. "At length messengers reached bit waste ground close village, saw extremely grimy-looking gipsy sitting bank. He knocked ashes his black pipe, muttered, 'I have luck dog! Here I lot best mouse-traps world, I have not sold one blessed day!' "'Here is luck!' said wise birds. 'That exactly man us; he neither two-winged four-legged, he quite safe.' "They flew rat-catcher made proposition. He laughed softly pleasantly himself, accepted invitation without demur, started light step lighter heart Hencastle. "Two days this, fowls heard Mark, watchman, crowing away lustily his chimney-pot, "'What I see? Here come three! And black beast bring Has tail wing.' "'But,' added sentinel less official language, 'he carries bundle things look like little houses made wire.' "The gipsy taken loft, having, luckily, scraps strong-smelling bacon left his last night's supper, he struck light managed make small fire long-disused grate bits dry grass chips. He frizzled bacon baited his traps, less ten minutes he filled all, mice never smelt delicious thing fried bacon before, besides, new wiles man. "The fowls wild delight, thankfulness bethought special mark favour, every hen came clucking laid egg his feet. "For week gipsy nothing catch mice eat eggs; things must end, bacon ran out, gipsy come conclusion he heartily sick egg-diet. Being man action, he put his hand suddenly caught fattest nicest young chicken within reach, promptly wrung neck. "Oh, row henroost! The cocks began crow loud enough split throats, hens fly cackle. The man nearly deafened, yelled top his voice, 'What expect, fools? Mice caught meat, meat I must too.' He let rave on, quietly methodically continued pluck his chicken. When ready, he made fire began roast it. "In meanwhile, Flaps heard noise outcry, showed signs abating, he thought man likely mischief, he went castle. "'Oh! Woe! Misery! Horror! Despair!' cried fowls soon saw him. 'The murderer slain young Scratchfoot cock, going roast him!' "'You are dead man,' growled Flaps rat-catcher, soon he got loft. "'I am sure that, fine cur,' said man, taking hold cudgel he brought him, tucking his sleeves. "But brave old dog sprang bit severely he uttered savage groan, dealt Flaps heavy blow his cudgel. This nearly broke dog's leg obliged relax his hold, gipsy dashed down-stairs ran away speed Flaps three legs chance overtaking him. "'Wait bit!' cried man afar. 'I will remember you!' And his retreating figure became smaller smaller heath last disappeared altogether. "This time fowls heart feast. They sat brooding moping rows rafters, began see clearly quite hopeless try get rid mice. "Poor old Flaps, too, ill. A good many days elapsed he could get about, years he walked lame his injured leg. "One morning fowls listlessly wandering about, wondering happen next, Mark, watchman, heard crowing away excited manner, "'What I see? Twenty three!' "'What see?' cried great fright. 'Twenty three what?' "'An army soldiers dressed smock frocks. They armed pitchforks, black gipsy general.' "The fowls flew like cloud roof, sure enough saw rat-catcher coming across heath crowd villagers towards castle. "When broke doleful news Flaps, he said, 'That scoundrel man betrayed hiding-place, must wander forth again. Get ready, keep spirits, remember case able stay much longer, account mice.' "So hens filled crops full possible, escaped Flaps back door. "When country-folk got house, found nothing small heap corn; fell upon gipsy half killed brought fool's errand. Then divided little corn left, went away. "As mice left whistle food. "So ends tale Hens Hencastle." "And fine tale too," said one stranger-hens asleep time, woke jump. "It deeply interesting." The threshers happened stopped rest moment, she would never woke all. "Of course was!" said cock, full dignity; he shook his feathers straight. "But became fowls afterwards?" asked one common hens. "I never tell hen secret," said cock; he strutted hunt worms. FLAPS. A SEQUEL TO "THE HENS OF HENCASTLE." And became Flaps left Hencastle? Well, he led his company on, could find suitable place settle in; fowls recovered fright, began think abandoned castle hastily, lay blame Flaps. Mark said he might overestimated number invaders. There might twenty-three, really Flaps hurry news, one must say something one's duty make report. The three wise cocks objected speak services, experience behalf community times danger, opinion panic, hasty action taken Flaps injudicious regrettable. The oldest hen Hencastle shook her feathers show much Flaps wrong, puffed show much she right; clearing her throat almost she going crow, she observed shrilly she "did not care contradicted her she said common sense Mother Family enough tell _her_ old dog, lost eye ear leg, fit protector feminine young inexperienced." The chief cock free his opinions chief hen, he grumbled scolded everything, one may make matters amply unpleasant without committing oneself incurring responsibility. Another hens made point opinion. She said her way, she trusted everybody alike bore her share suffering, seldom small, without murmur. But her good wishes always one's service, she would say she sincerely hoped sad injustice done red-haired gentleman singularly agreeable manners, would gatekeeper Hencastle moment Flaps. Poor Flaps! Well might he say, "One ear enough listen with, pack ungrateful fools!" He beginning find that, rule, Helpless nice way flinging cares upon Helpful, reserving energies pick holes done behalf; apt flourish, good health poor spirits, long friends Flaps worn out, bit bit, service. "First eye, ear, leg," old dog growled himself; "and there is fowl feather him. But I have done duty, that is enough." Matters went bad worse. The hens corn, Flaps got eggs, prospect either home food seemed remote. One evening rainy, fowls roosted walnut-tree shelter, Flaps fell asleep foot it. "Could anything aggravating creature's indifference?" said Hen No. 2. "Here sit, wet skin, he lies asleep! Dear me! I remember one neck feathers got awry once, dear old Hencastle (the pencilling good deal admired time, though I say should not), Red-haired Gentleman noticed moment. I remember he put his face close mine I you, gentlemanly manner, murmured softly, "'Excuse me--there is one lovely little feathers least bit world--' "I believe actually his lips, interrupted, I put tidy myself. But might plucked bare poor young Scratchfoot Flaps would think smoothing us down. Just hear he snores! Ah! it is trying world, I never complain." "I do, though," said chief hen. "I am one put neglect. Hi, there! asleep?" And scratching bit rough bark walnut-tree, she let drop Flaps' nose. "I am awake," said Flaps; "what is matter?" "I never knew one snore he awake before," said hen; young cockerels chuckled. "Well, I believe I napping," said Flaps. "Damp weather always makes sleepy, I dreaming old farmyard." "Poor old farm!" sighed Hen No. 2. "We board lodging there, rate." "And we have neither," said Hen No. 1. "Mr. Flaps, know we are wet skin, dying starvation, whilst put nose great-coat pocket go sleep?" "You are right," said Flaps. "Something must done evening. But I see use taking whole community rain. We send another expedition." "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" screamed three wise ones; "that means we are face storm whilst another nap, eh?" "It seems odd thing," said chief cock, scratching his comb his claw, "that Flaps never thinks going expeditions." "You are right," said Flaps. "It odd thing, times mind I have heard old friend, farmer, say, 'If want thing done--Go; not--Send.' This time I shall go. Cuddle close other, keep spirits. I will find us good home yet." The fowls much affected Flaps' magnanimity, one voice cried: "Thank you, dear Flaps. Whatever decide upon us." And Mark added, "I continue act watchman." And he went top tree Flaps trotted muddy road. All evening far night rained rained, fowls cuddled close keep warm, Flaps return. In small hours morning rain ceased, rain-clouds drifted away, night-sky faded faded till dawn. "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" said Mark, fowls woke up. "What see hear tree-top, dear Mark?" said they. "Is Flaps coming?" "Not thing I see From top tree, But long, winding lane That sloppy rain;" replied Mark. And fowls huddled together again, put heads back wings. Paler paler grew grey sky, last broken golden bars, first red streak caught fire behind them, Mark crowed louder before, hens Hencastle roused good. "What see hear tree-top, dear Mark?" inquired. "Is Flaps coming?" "Not sound I hear, And I much fear That Flaps, spite, Has deserted us quite;" replied Mark. And fowls said nothing, means ease consciences. Their delight proportionably great when, minutes later, sentinel sang his post, "Here comes Flaps, like mail! And he is waving his tail." "Well, dear, dear Flaps!" cackled he came trotting up, "where new home, like?" "Will plenty eat?" asked cocks one crow. "Plenty," replied Flaps. "Shall safe mice, owls, wild beasts, wild men?" cried hens. "You will," answered Flaps. "Is far, dear Flaps?" "It near," said Flaps; "but I may well tell truth once--it is farmyard." "Oh!--" said fowls. "We may roasted, heads chopped off," whimpered young cockerels. "Well, Scratchfoot roasted Hencastle," said Flaps; "and he was not loss. One cannot everything world; I assure you, could see poultry-yard--so dry foot, nicely wired marauders; charming nests, fresh hay them; drinking-troughs; regular intervals, abundance corn, mashed potatoes, bones, mouth watered at--are served out--" "That sounds good," said young cockerels. "Ahem! ahem!" said chief cock. "Did see anything remarkable--were specimens race much superior strength good looks?----" "My dear cock!" said Flaps; "there is tail comb hackle touch you. You will cock walk time." "Ahem! ahem!" said chief cock modestly. "I always sort fatality way. Pray, dears, do not look foolish deplorable, get young people together, let us make start. Mr. Flaps person strong common sense, quality I always remarkable, I thoroughly endorse support his excellent advice, I best judge. I much regretted late observe tendency family (I say tendency, I hope goes further) undervalue Mr. Flaps, even (I hardly like allude reprehensible disgusting absurdity) recall memory vulgar red-haired impostor, gained brief entrance family circle. I consulted I fluctuations opinion, occasions necessary head family exercise his discretion his authority, and, speak, put his claw. I put claw. We going Mr. Flaps' farmyard. Cock-a-doodle-doo Cock-a-doodle-doo!" Now, head family says "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" nothing said. So farmyard whole lot went, sun got one golden hair his head roof big barn. And Mark, crowded new home, turned his head round his back say: "And you, Flaps; shall do?" "Oh, I shall right," said Flaps. "Good-bye good luck you." It cannot said Flaps positively high spirits he settled his protégés new home farmyard, left alone; good folk contrive make duty work pleasure life, piece business fairly finished good treat. It bread bones, however, Flaps hungry--so hungry he could resist temptation make his way towards farmhouse, chance picking scraps outside. And came about, farmer's little daughter Daisy, face like rosy side white-heart cherry set deep lilac print hood, came back going dairy lass fetch cows, she found Flaps snuffing back door, she put her arms round his neck (they reached right round little squeezing) said: "Oh, I never knew you would early! You nice thing!" And Flaps' nose went right print hood, he put his tongue licked Daisy's face point her chin her right cheek her forehead, her forehead her left cheek back her chin, he found she nice thing too. But dairymaid screamed, "Good gracious! nasty strange dog come from? Leave alone, Miss Daisy, he will bite nose off." "He will not!" said Daisy indignantly. "He is dog Daddy promised me;" farmer coming minute, she ran crying, "Daddy! Is not dog?" "Bless child, no!" said farmer; "it is nice little pup I am going give thee. Where dirty old brute come from?" "He would wash," said little Daisy, holding fast Flaps' coat. "Fine washing too!" said dairymaid, "And his hair's lugs." "I could comb them," said Daisy. "He is got one eye," said swineherd. "Haw! haw! haw!" "He sees other," said Daisy. "He is looking now." "And one his ears gone!" cried dairy lass. "He! he! he!" "Perhaps I could make cap," said Daisy, "as I doll lost her wig. It pink ribbons looked nice." "Why, he is lame leg," guffawed two farming-men. "See, missy, he hirples three." "I cannot run fast," said Daisy, "and I am old enough to, perhaps his leg well." "Why, do not want old thing play-fellow, child?" said farmer. "I do! I do!" wept Daisy. "But why, name whims whamsies?" "Because I love him," said Daisy. When comes heart, argument wasted head; farmer-went on: "Why he is neither useful ornamental. He is good dog his day, I dare say; now--" At moment Flaps threw his head air sniffed, his one eye glared, he set his teeth growled. He smelt gipsy, gipsy's black pipe, every hair stood end rage. "The dog's mad!" cried swineherd, seizing pitchfork. "You are fool," said farmer (who was not). "There is one behind haystack, old watch-dog's back up. See! he runs; I am sinner, it is black rascal loitering round, day ricks fired, lads let slip. Off him, I fancy I see smoke." And farmer flew his haystacks. Hungry tired he was, Flaps would pursued his old enemy, Daisy would let go. She took ear led indoors breakfast instead. She large basin bread-and-milk, she divided two portions, gave one Flaps kept herself. And she says she loves Flaps, I leave guess got bread-and-milk. That gipsy came live time county gaol, he made mouse-traps rather nicely good rate-payers. And Flaps, cared well others, well cared himself, lived happily end his days. * * * * * "Why, it is print!" said Father Cock; "and I said plain cock could crow, secret. Now, let out?" "Do not talk secrets," said fair foreigner; "I never trouble head things." "Some people fond drawing attention heads," said common hen; "and people did not think great unnatural-looking chignon domestic virtues put together, might confidences respected." "I's well," said Father Cock, "but you are alike. There is hen know secret without going telling it." "Well, come!" said little Bantam hen, newly arrived; "whichever hen told it, cock must told first." "What is ridiculous nonsense talking?" cried cock; he ran her pecked her well his beak. "Oh! oh! oh!" cried Bantam. Dab, dab, dab, pecked cock. "Now! anybody else got anything say subject?" But nobody had. So he flew wall, cried "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" A WEEK SPENT IN A GLASS POND. BY THE GREAT WATER-BEETLE. Very beetles ever seen Glass Pond. I spent week one, though I think, good management, society suitably selected, may comfortable home enough, I advise water-neighbours content pond wood. The story brief sojourn Glass Pond story moral, concerns two large classes fellow-creatures: live ponds and--those do not. If I tell it, one else will. Those connected belong second class (namely, Francis, Molly, learned Doctor, grandfather) not, I sure. And rest us, none left but-- However, end tale, beginning. The beginning, far I concerned, Pond. It difficult describe pond people cannot live water, I found next door impossible make minnow I knew believe dry land. He said, last, perhaps might little space beyond pond hot weather, water low; utmost he would allow. But cold-blooded unconvinceable creatures, obstinate fish. Men different. They refuse believe lies beyond personal experience. I respected learned Doctor, really sorry disadvantages he laboured. That creature his intelligence two eyes, even compound ones--that he able see water dark--that he nothing like six legs, quite without wings, he could even fly his window turn air summer's evening--these drawbacks made quite sorry him; he none minnow's complacent ignorance. He knew advantages well I knew myself, bore ill-will them. "The _Dyticus marginalis_, Great Water-Beetle," I heard say, handsomest manner, "is equally home air, water. Like insects perfect state, six legs, hindmost pair great strength, fringed serve paddles. It powerful wings, and, Shakespeare's witches, flies night. It two simple, two sets compound eyes. When goes water, carries stock air it, diving-bell principle; exhausted, comes surface, tail uppermost, fresh supply. It voracious carnivorous water-beetles." The last sentence rather unkind reflection good appetite, otherwise Doctor spoke handsomely me, without envy. And yet I sure could matter wonder compound eyes, instance, sore subject man knew them, whose one simple pair nearly worn out. More once, I seen old gentleman put green shade his reading-lamp, glasses his eyes, I felt inclined hum,--"Ah, dear Doctor, could take cool turn pond! You would want glasses green shades, light comes tenderly subdued water water-weeds." Indeed, living, I can, three--water, dry land, air,--I certainly prefer water. Any one whose appetite keen, whose hind-legs powerful mine, understand delights hunting, hunted, pond; light comes fitful rays reflections water, gleams among hanging roots frog-bit, fading leaves water-starwort, maze which, out, hither thither, pursue, pursued, cool skilful chase, mixed company neighbours, dart, shoot, dive, come go, one moment may either eat eaten you. And want peace quiet, one bury oneself safely completely mud? A state existence, without mud bottom, must life without repose. I mud one day, head downwards, human voices came water. It summer, pond low time. "Oh, Francis! Francis! The Water-Soldier[D] flower." "Hooray! Dig aquarium! Grandfather says it is rare--does not he?" "He says it is common; there is one, Francis. It would pity did not get roots, died." "Nonsense, Molly. I will get up. But let us get beasts first. You get pickle-jar ready, whilst I fix stick colander." "Does cook know you have taken it, Francis?" "By time she does, I think. Look here, Molly--I wish would try get stick right. It wants driving handles. I am going look Water-Soldier." "You always give work do," Molly complained; she spoke, I climbed old stake firmly planted mud, seated top, stood water, looked her. She neat-looking little soul, rosy cheeks, resolute expression countenance. She looked redder firmer usual she drove broomstick handles colander, whilst boy side pond Water-Soldier, whose maiden-blossom shone white among sword-leaves. It shone sunshine came gaily gap trees, warmed coat wings, made pond look lovely. That greedy _Ranatra_, eats much, never looks bit solid his meals, crept reed sunned his wings; water-gnats skimmed skated about, measuring surface water long legs; "boatmen" shot till one quite giddy, showing white bodies, like swallows wheeling autumn-flight. Even water-scorpion moved slowly sunny place roots arrow-head lily dark corner duck-weed. "Molly!" shouted boy; "I wish you would come give pull Water-Soldier. I have nearly got up; leaves cut hands, you have got gloves. If colander ready, I will begin fish. There is beetle stick. I wish I near enough, I could snatch like anything." "I would not advise to," said Molly. "Grandfather says water-beetles got daggers tails. Besides, beetles greedy eat fish." "The Big Black one does not," said Francis. "He said so. _Hydröus piceus_ name, I dare say that is one. It is biggest water-beetles harmless." "He _may_ good one," said Molly, looking thoughtfully unmistakably me, "but he may one bad ones; he is, he will eat everything him." But time Francis dipping colander opposite side, she left struggle Water-Soldier. "He is last," she announced, Soldier landed bank. "Come round," said boy; "I have filled three jars." "I hope you have careful, Francis. You know Grandfather says stock fresh-water aquarium like puzzle Fox Geese bag seed. It is use things eat other." "They must eat something," said boy; "they are used home; I wish would not always cramming Grandfather throat. I want aquarium way; I gave towards buying bell-glass, it is mine yours." "Well, like; let us plenty water-boatmen," said Molly. "I have got half-a-dozen least; last sweep I went low, quite mud, I have got horrid things. There is one like flat-iron, pincers point." "That is water-scorpion. Oh, Francis! he eats dreadfully." "I do not believe he can, he is flat. Molly, nasty-looking thing dragon-fly larva?" "I believe is; mask. You know his face ugly nothing would come near he did not wear mask. Then he lifts snaps suddenly; _he_ really _does_ eat everything!" "Well, I cannot help it. I must him. I want see hatch; I shall plant bullrush climb up." "I found caddis-worm, beautifully built house, roots Water-Soldier, I am going look along edge shells. We must she will-fish, know, keep aquarium clean. Oh!" "What it, Molly? What found?" "Oh, lovely spider! A water-spider--a scarlet spider. He is small, colour! Francis dear, may I keep myself? I do not think I _can_ let go others. If dragon-fly larva ate him, I never forgive myself, know do not know certain beetle _Hydröus piceus_. I shall give aquarium his green finger-glass, nothing little nice duckweed, one small snail keep clean, like general servant. May I, Francis?" "By means. I do not want scarlet spider. I get lots more." He went dipping colander, she began dig water-plants lay heap. I sat watched them, _Ranatra_ got nervous tried go below. As usual, dry bristles his tail would pierce water without struggle, floundering ludicrous fashion minutes, he fell straight colander, put one pickle-jars. "I have got enough now," said boy, "and I want go home see net. I must fish. Can carry plants, Molly?" "I will manage," said Molly. "Now I am ready." "Wait minute, though--I would forgotten beetle." When I heard I dropped water; somehow I turned clumsily, and, like _Ranatra_, I fell colander, transferred pickle-jar. Anything disagreeable shaken glass bottle, beetles, boatmen, larvæ sorts sizes, including dragon-fly second stage his career, I hardly imagine. When took us put us glass pond, matters certainly better, though vast difference glass pond pond wood. The first day means bad imitation real pond, except want bed mud. Molly covered bottom glass gravel she steadily washed till water would run clear it, spite impatient exclamations Francis, "would now," quite regardless inconvenience I subjected kept pickle-jar. In gravel she embedded roots Water Crowfoot pond-plants. The stones middle nicely arranged, well covered moss water-weeds. When water poured brim bell-glass, emptied jars, dragon-fly larva got good hole among stones ate May-fly grubs, water-shrimps, forth, came sight. I badly myself, bigger stronger members society skins next day, Francis brought jar full minnows, small carp, bull's-head, turned midst. "How dart swim round round!" he exclaimed. "Splendid," said Molly. "I _am_ sorry I going away now. You try keep water fresh, will not you?" "Of course I will. And let scarlet spider whilst away. I could not find another." "Well, must; take care, Francis. And two bits gutta-percha tubing make syphons. You must put hot water minute bend them, know." "I will to-morrow, Molly; I nothing else _to_ do, know, Edward Brown will not back three four days. So nothing cricket club." It third day, pieces gutta-percha tubing wash-hand basin hot water, dragon-fly larva I finishing minnow, help water-scorpion, Master Edward Brown arrived unexpectedly, pressed his friend Francis come consult "just two minutes," delayed he got him, tubing melted shapeless lump, carp died unnoticed one myself. On fourth day glass pond moved conservatory, "to way." The fish excellent eating, though snails wits' end refuse rotted, water became stagnant, weeds grew, till she will-fish pond could kept place clean,--I mind myself. As water got low, I found nice bit rockwork water, I could sit day, night lights drawing-room gave indescribable stimulus wings, I sailed in, flew round round till I tired, (forgetting pond, even bed mud, me!) drew wings, dropped sharply floor. To family justice, learned know sound fall, even old Doctor would go hands knees hunt sofa, fear I trodden on. On fifth day I swallowed scarlet spider. I hated it, I thought Molly; spider foolish meet me. He kept behind. And I had not eaten him, dragon-fly larva would. What _he_ eaten, I think he could told himself. There little left one; even water-scorpion disappeared. On sixth day glass pond two tenants worth speaking of--the dragon-fly larva myself. We over-eaten ourselves, hours moved slowly thickening puddle, nodding civilly passed among feathery sprays Water Crowfoot. Then I began get hungry. I knew feeling impulse look dragon-fly larva, I knew he knew he began avoid me. On seventh day Molly ran conservatory, followed her brother, uttered cry dismay. "Oh, state it is in! Where syphons?" "Why, melted day Edward Brown came back. We have lot cricket, Molly!" "There is not fish left, smells horribly." "I am sorry, Molly. Let us throw out. I do not want Grandfather see it. Let come." "No, no, Francis! There may left. Yes, there is beetle. I shall put pail take back pond. Oh dear! oh dear! I cannot see anything scarlet spider. My beautiful scarlet spider! I fond him. Oh, I sorry! And one watered Soldier, he is dead too." "Do not cry, Molly! Please do not cry! I dare say spider there, it is small." For time Molly poked carefully there, spider found, contents aquarium carried back wood. I glad see pond again. The water-gnats taking dimensions usual, blue-black beetle sat humming stake, dragon-flies flitted hungrily about, like splinters broken rainbow; Water-Soldier's place empty, never refilled. He specimen. Molly probably right when, last vain search scarlet spider, Francis slowly emptied pail, she said sigh, "What makes sorry is, I do not think ought 'collected' things unless really attended them, knew keep alive."

I remember time I, brother me, devoutly believed supposed live among certain black, water-rotted, weed-grown stakes sea. These old wooden ruins were, I fancy, remains rude pier, amid them, tide low, used play, pay fancy visits fancy friend. We called her Shriny--why, I know I first read Croker's delightful story "The Soul Cages" I knew Merrow Jack went see waves called Coomara. My remembrance even fancied Shriny dim now; brother four years old (I eight), his distinct. I know thought her, talked her, always eager visit her supposed abode, wander together amongst rotten pillars (which, small, seemed lofty enough eyes), mussels limpets held tightly on, slimy, olive-green fucus hung loosely down--a sea-ivy covering ruins made waves. I never place since days. If Shriny's palace all, I dare say I find stakes stumps, vastness mystery gone ever. And yet used pretend feast her there. We served seed-vessels fucus fish. I think really ate them, sucked salt water, tried fancy enjoying repast. Once _began_ eat limpet!--Beyond point memory dumb. I wonder felt Shriny really appeared us, Coomara appeared Jack Dogherty, taken us waves, kept us among stakes her palace till tide flooded them, perhaps filled wonderful creatures beautiful things, floated dank, dripping fucus veil lace heads; mother used float little dirty lumps seaweed beautiful web-like pictures she preserving her collection. Shriny never come, though Mr. Croker says Coomara came Jack. Perhaps, young readers, never read story Soul Cages. It long one, I going repeat here, say word two it, I reason. Jack Dogherty--so story goes--had always longed see Merrow. Merrow Irish name seafolk; indeed, properly means mermaid. And Jack, know, lived fairy tale, lodgings watering-place south coast; he saw his Merrow, though never saw Shriny. I think after-history Merrow equal Mr. Croker's account his first appearance Jack: afterwards "Old Coo" becomes like tipsy old fisherman man-fish he was. The first appearance coast northward, "just Jack turning point, he saw something, like nothing he ever seen before, perched upon rock little distance sea; looked green body, well he could discern distance, he would sworn, thing impossible, cocked-hat hand. Jack stood good half-hour, straining his eyes wondering it, time thing stir hand foot. At last Jack's patience quite worn out, he gave loud whistle hail, Merrow (for was) started up, put cocked-hat head, dived down, head foremost, rocks." For long time Jack could get nearer view "the sea-gentleman cocked-hat," last, one stormy day, he taken refuge one caves along coast, "he saw, sitting him, thing green hair, long green teeth, red nose, pig's eyes. It fish's tail, legs scales them, short arms like fins. It wore clothes, cocked-hat arm, seemed engaged thinking seriously something." As I copy words--_It wore clothes, cocked-hat arm, seemed engaged thinking seriously something_--it seems portrait strangely like something I seen. And I think it, I convinced type familiar me, that, though I live fairy story, I among Merrows. And still one pleases may go see Coomara's cousins day. There doubt it! I seen Merrow--several Merrows. That unclothed, over-harnessed form now; sitting motionless rock, "engaged thinking seriously," till sudden impulse rises, turns red nose, makes sharp angular movements head elbows, plunges down, much grace stiff, red-nosed old admiral, dressed nothing cocked-hat, spectacles, telescope, sword his legs, take header quarter-deck sea. I want make mystery nothing. I resented thoroughly I young. I make pretence glimpses fairyland. I could see Shriny I eight years old, I never shall now. Besides, one sees fairies now-a-days. The "path bonnie Elfland" long overgrown, far Princes press wake Beauties sleep beyond. For compensation, paths Mother Nature's Wonderland made broader, easier, attractive feet men, day day. And Mother Nature's Merrows I seen--in Crystal Palace Aquarium. How Mr. Croker drew picture Coomara Merrow, he probably never saw sea crayfish, lobster, even prawn home, I cannot account for, except divining prophetic instincts genius. And I speak his seeing crayfish, lobster, prawn home, I mean home, Mr. Croker's. Two different things friends "sea-gentlemen," colour well ways. In his home, instance, lobster various beautiful shades blue purple. In Mr. Croker's home he would bright scarlet--from boiling! So would prawn, solid please; his home colourless transparent ghost. Strangely beautiful prawns see home. And one seems Great Aquarium; though, I suppose, much like seeing land beasts birds Zoological Gardens--a poor imitation free life natural condition. Still, way see come know wonderful "sea gentlemen" well, unless could go, like Jack Dogherty, visit bottom sea. And whilst I heartily recommend every one seen Aquarium visit soon possible, let describe benefit cannot present. It may also little use hereafter know worth seeing there, look it. No sooner paid sixpence turnstile admits you, eye caught seems large window wall, near man taken money. You look glass, find looking deep sea-pool, low stone-grey rocks studded sea-anemones full bloom. There twenty-one different species sea-anemones Aquarium; seen particular pool chosen seven largest kinds. The biggest, _Tealia crassicornis_, measures ten inches across he spreads his pearly fingers full extent. "In young days" called familiar name Crassy; found difficult keep domestic captivity, delightful see blooming thriving he Tank No. 1 Great Aquarium. His squat build--low broad--contrasts well tall white neighbours his (_Dianthus plumosa_), whose faces like plume snowy feathers. All sea-anemones tank settled rocks according fancy. They lovely shades colour, rosy, salmon-coloured, pearly-white. There five thousand sea-anemones various kinds Aquarium; attendant, whose sole occupation feed them, means pair long wooden forceps. Reluctantly breaking away old friends, pass door long vault-like stone passage hall, one side seem high large windows, far apart windows long room commonly are. Behind sea-pool like first one. Take first lot--Tank No. 2. It stocked _Serpulæ_. Sea-anemones well-known people, tube-worms familiar friends; I try describe particular kind "sea-gentlemen." The tube-worms called because, though true worms (sea-worms), trust soft bodies sea, common earth-worms trust garden-bed, build tubes inside live, popping heads top like chimney-sweep pushing his brush top tall round chimney. Now fancy one tall round manufactory chimneys white instead black, round chimney-sweep's brush lovely gay-coloured feathers round instead dirty bristles, fancy sweep letting monster catherine-wheel chimney's mouth, may idea tube-worm's head like he pokes his tube. The _Serpulæ_ make tubes chalky stuff, something like egg-she will; stick anything comes hand below. Those Great Aquarium came Weymouth. They dredged white pipes tubes sticking oyster-shells, old bottles, stones, not, like bits maccaroni glued old crockery sherds. These odds ends overgrown, however, weeds zoophytes, (like ugly house covered creepers) look picturesque rather otherwise. The worms small bristles bodies, serve feet, help scramble inside tubes, wish poke heads breathe. These heads delicate, bright-coloured plumes. Each species plume special shape colour. They seen animal alive. A good many little _Serpulæ_ born Aquarium. Through next window--Tank No. 3--you may see tube-worms, ray-like, daisy heads, soft muddy tubes. They _Sabellæ_. Have ever see "sea-mouse"? Probably have: preserved bottle. It like mouse size mouse's body, without legs, lot rainbow-coloured hairs. You may astonished hear classed among worms. There sea-mouse Great Aquarium. I see him; perhaps he given burrowing. If he one two tanks named he probably No. 21 No. 25. He handsome dead bottle, he must gorgeous behold alive pool. You look him. It disappointing feature water wonderland "sea-gentlemen" apt hide, like hobbledehoy children, visitors call. Indeed, good many them--such swimming-crabs, burrowing-crabs, sea-scorpions, eels--are night-feeders, one cannot expect change whole habits customs seen British public. Anyhow, whether hide custom caprice, quite safe interference. Much happier, respect, beasts Zoological Gardens. One may disturb big elephant's repose umbrella-points, throw buns brown bear, "sea-gentlemen" safe caves, humanity flattens nose glass wall separation vain. When I looked Tank No. 5, however, several swimming-crabs sea-scorpions seen. The sea-scorpions fish, bold-faced, fiery, greedy little fellows. The swimming-crabs said "the largest, strongest, _hungriest_" English crabs. What thought live on! Let us picture largest, strongest, _hungriest_ cannibals! Doubtless he would make short work even American Giant, swimming-crabs, night, devour crabs, larger milder-tempered themselves. It speaks volumes sea-scorpions, small fish, hold pool swimming-crabs. Tank 4 contains big spider-crabs, sit knees heads, winking eyes feelers; scramble unexpectedly dens caves there, high rocky sides pool. Nos. 6, 7, 8 contain fish. It really sad think completely ideas subject cod spring kitchen fish-kettle. (As cod-liver oil, know much anything cod-fish guess milk port-wine come from.) Poor cod! If certain social standing, it is odds recognize his head shoulders. I seen served country inns pickled walnut socket eye; life, home, he attentive, inquisitive, watchful, humorous eyes common fishes. Fishes remind rather Chinese, also cold-blooded race: slow, watchful, inquisitive, acquisitive, full sense humour. There fishes Great Aquarium whose faces twinkle quiet fun. The cod seemed quite much interested looking us glass window looking them. They tame, large appetites--so tame, hungry, fish live disadvantage meal-times, feared must removed. These fish plaice, soles, brill, turbot, skate. The skate love lie buried head ears sand. The faintest outline tail flapping fin betrays spot, long umbrella-poke Zoological-Garden-frequenting old lady, stir lazy creature up; impossible. Suddenly, tired waiting Jack Coomara "engaged thinking," fin movement becomes distinct, cloud sand rises water, grey-coated skate, two ornamental knobs upon his tail, flaps slowly away across pool. Sometimes flat-fish flap upwards surface, poke noses world, then, like larks, gone effort, let easily ground. As looking No. 7, ambitious little sole took his head climb rocks, caves dwell crusty crabs. By marvellously agile doubles his flat little body, he scrambled good way up. Then he fell, two three valiant efforts still proving vain, he gave up. "He is turned giddy!" shouted man beside us, who, like every one else, watching sea-gentlemen rapt interest. Why little sole tried rock climbing I do not know, I doubt he knew himself. Tank 7 full Basse--glittering fish keep silver armour clean scrubbing among stones. Like prettily-dressed people, look window along. At Tanks 1, 2, 3, chief feelings curiosity admiration. The sea-flowers worms rather low scale living things. Far decide living creatures loving intelligent patience last enable us hold communion. But though, put point little finger towards Crassy, he gives affectionate squeeze, seems rather anxious detain permanently, balance evidence favours idea his appetite rather his affections concerned, he mistaken his dinner. At present intercourse certainly limited, though _Serpulæ_ _Sabellæ_ heads chimneys along, reason suppose take slightest interest human beings peer glass. But fishes quite another thing. When fairly look eyes bright expressive own, long stride taken towards friendly relations. You flatten nose one side glass, Mr. Fish flattens his other. If stoniest British stares he outstare you. You long scratch his back, show similar attention, (if he cod) ask him, friends, earth (I mean sea) he wears queer horn his chin. Now _Crustaceans_(hard-shelled sea-gentlemen) different again. So far one feels friendly towards fish fellow feeling. You know people like cod, one knows people like certain sheep, dogs, horses. And short acquaintance fish convinces type face belonging species, individual countenances vary, us. It said shepherds know faces sheep well friends, I doubt keeper Great Aquarium knows his cod apart quite well. And one's feeling _Crustaceans_--the crabs, lobsters, prawns, &c.--is different, one feels less intelligent fishes, intelligence altogether mysterious, unfathomable, unmeasurable quantity. There is saying do not know. There telling much see. And great puzzle thinking of. For spiny lobsters thinking, "thinking seriously something," doubt Jack Merrow. The spiny lobsters (commonly, erroneously called craw-fish cray-fish) common lobsters Tank No. 9. Ah! wonderful pool. The first glimpse spiny lobsters enough one read Coomara. We among Merrows last. I do not know Coomara lobster, I think he must crustacean. Even his green hair reminds one spider-crabs; though matter-of-fact naturalists tell us _their_ green hair seaweed grows luxuriantly shells quiet habits, given burrowing, cleaning among stones like silver-coated basse. At one time, bye, supposed dressed weeds, whence called "vanity-crabs." But spiny lobsters--please look them, see much guess age, capabilities, intentions. I fancy difference feelings fishes inspire us much mental attitude towards hill-men house-elves, towards men women. The spiny lobsters red. The common lobsters blue. The spiny lobsters large, eyes startlingly prominent, powerful antennæ longer redder Coomara's nose, wave inquisitive somewhat threatening manner. When four five gathered together centre pool, sitting solemnly tails, tucked neatly them, his ten sharp elbows a-kimbo "engaged thinking" (and perhaps talking) "very seriously something," impressive _uncanny_ sight. We witnessed conclave, sitting close circle, face face, waving long antennæ; watched, shadowy caves another merrow appeared. How he ever got his cumbersome coat mail, his stiff legs, long spines safely face cliff mystery. But he scrambled ledge ledge, bravely, haste. He knew meeting about, though not, soon took his place, arranged his tail, his scales, his elbows, his cocked-hat, not, fell a-thinking, like rest. We left so. Most common lobsters caves, watched meeting reds fixed attention. In dark-blue coats, peering keen eyes behind jutting rocks mouths sea caverns, looked somewhat like smuggler sailors! Tanks 10 13 fish them. The Wrasses beautiful colour. Most gorgeous indeed, look particular way. Tank 32 made purpose display them. It another room. No tank Aquarium popular Tank 14. Enthusiastic people sit needlework luncheon, calmly wait good view of--the cuttle-fish! Cuttle name whole race cephalopods, supposed corruption word cuddle, sense hugging. They curious creatures, one favoured us good view like loose red velvet pincushion eight legs, bran let out. Yet strange, unshapely creature distinct brain soft kind skull, mandibles like parrot, plenty sense. His sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell acute. He lies kicking his legs doorway his favourite cavern, he selected attached to, provokingly long time he come out. When he appear, subdued groan gratified expectation runs crowd front his window, head heels, hand hand, he sprawls downwards, moves quickly away peculiar gait induced suckers instead feet walk with. Tank 15 contains eels. It seems curious fact fresh-water eels live sea-water. I think, got used salt, must find pond tasteless afterwards. They night-feeders, school-boys know well. Tank 16. Fish--grey mullet. Tank 17. Prawns. If fishes felt friends, lobsters hobgoblins, prawns seemed find among ghosts. A tank seems pool cuttle-fish, cod, vast region prawns shrimps inhabitants. The caves look huge, would hold army them. The rocks jut boldly out, throw strange shadows pool. The light falls effectively above, round go prawns, black eyes glaring diaphanous helmets, colourless, translucent, transparent armour, bristling spears. "They like disembodied spirits," said husband. But moment exclaimed, "It is like scene Martin's mezzo-tint illustrations _Paradise Lost_. They ghostly hosts gathering battle." This must seem absurd idea connection prawns; never seen prawns except breakfast-table, must go Great Aquarium learn impressive appearance real life. The warlike group struck us forcibly gathered rapidly parts pool upon piece flat table-rock jutted high up. Some unexplained excitement agitated host; innumerable spear-like antennæ moved ceaselessly. From ray light fell upon table-rock gathered, making waving spears glitter like bayonet points body troops, forming striking contrast dark cliffs overshadowed water below, stragglers quickly gathering, paddling across deep pool, others scrambling rocks, fierce restless expression. How I longed chance sketching scene! Prawns quite colourless creatures sea here. Why lose colour markings captivity known. They seem otherwise well. They hungry creatures, scent keen. The shrimps keep sight; burrow sand good deal. You know one look fresh-water shrimps brook one wants find them. In Tank 18 old friends hermit-crabs. As child, I think I believed curious creatures killed original inhabitants shells take dwelling. It pleasant know case. The hermit-crab fact sea-gentleman, unfortunate born naked, quite unable make his clothes, goes nervously world, trying people's cast-off coats till he finds one fit him. They funnily fastidious shells, feeling one well inside decide try it, hesitating sometimes two, like lady couple becoming bonnets. They said pugnacious; I fancy old name soldier-crabs given impression killed former proprietors shells. With No. 18 window tanks come end. In two rooms number shallow tanks open top, smaller sea-anemones, star-fish, crabs, fishes, &c., &c. Blennies quaint, intellectual-looking little fish; friendly too, easy tamed. In one Major Holland's charming papers _Science Gossip_ he speaks pet blenny his tame musical. "He exceedingly sensitive vibrations stringed instruments; softest note violin threw state agitation, harsh scrape vigorous _staccato_ drove wild." In Tank 34 gurnards, fish-gentlemen, exquisite blue fins, like peacock's feathers. No. 35 contains dragonets star-fish. The dragonets quaint, wide-awake little fish. I saw one snap big, fat, red star-fish, sticking side rock. Why dragonet snapped I idea. I believe he hurt him; star-fish gradually relaxed his hold, fell slowly helplessly his back; dragonet looked silly Sultan Casgar's purveyor hunchback fell beneath his blows. Another dragonet came hastily see matter; prudently made again, left star-fish his neighbour were. I waited long time tank, watching result; vain. The star-fish, looking abjectly silly, lay his white side up, without effort help himself. As dragonet, he stuck his nose, fixed his eyes, fell a-thinking. So I left them. In Tank 38 Norwegian lobsters; red white, pretty, differing English ones form well colour. The green anemones Tank 33 beautiful. The arrangement tanks temporary. As sea-gentlemen much rapacious others, prey upon others, arranging must like old puzzle fox, goose, bag seed. Then new creatures arrive necessitates fresh arrangements. There much vegetation yet tanks, may puzzle people accustomed balance animal vegetable life aquaria introducing full-grown sea-weeds. But found often fail, better trust weeds come action light upon invisible seeds float sea-water. The pools also kept healthy water kept constant motion agency pipes, steam-engines, huge reservoir sea-water. It easy speak due admiration scientific skill, loving patience, mindfulness public good must gone forming Public Aquarium. With different eyes must innumerable "trippers" less-educated masses people look tide pools crab holes, brief holiday seaside, previously "trippers" Crystal Palace, visited Great Aquarium. Let us hope may stir sight-seers naturalists, naturalists devote powers furthering limited friendship sea-gentry. How much remains done may gathered fact yet keep deep-sea Merrows aquaria, shore-dwellers live us, these. And insuperable, yet, difficulties transport, "distinguished foreigners" rare indeed. Still, stands, Great Aquarium wonderful--wonderful exceedingly. There still greater one Brighton, holding greater wonders--a baby alligator amongst them--and glad hear one established Manchester also. It well said love nature strong characteristic even roughest type Britons. An Englishman's first idea holiday get country, even his second apt search country beer-house. Of birds, beasts, trees, flowers, good deal even rustic lore. Of wonders deep know much less. Thousands us sing understanding, O Lord, manifold thy works! In wisdom hast thou made all. The earth full Thy riches. Surely hereafter us shall swell antiphon, So great wide sea also, Wherein things creeping innumerable, Both small great beasts. * * * * * NOTE.--A Great Aquarium (and something more) made Naples young German naturalist--Dr. Dohrn, Stettin--at expense £7000 £8000, nearly comes his pocket. The ground-floor building (an area nearly eight thousand square feet) hold Great Aquarium. It hoped money obtained opening public support Aquarium itself, something towards defraying expenses upper story Zoological Station, called. This contain scientific library, including Dr. Dohrn's valuable private collection, tables naturalists work at, furnished necessary appurtenances, including tanks supplied constant stream sea-water. Sea-fishing dredging carried connection establishment, supply subjects study. Dr. Dohrn proposes let certain tables governments scientific societies, privilege giving certificates, enable naturalists enjoy benefits institution. Surely new acquaintances made among sea-gentry paradise naturalists! TINY'S TRICKS AND TOBY'S TRICKS. TINY. "Oh Toby, dear old Toby, portly princely Pug!

"Hoot toots, man, yon's queer bird!" _Bonnie Scotland._ I AM Owl; fluffy one, spite Bad Boy pulled out! I live Ivy Bush. Children nothing me, naturally, seems strange I begin, time life, observe little ways humours, give good advice. And yet so. I Friend Young People. In flight abroad I watch them. As I sit meditating Ivy Bush, little matters I turn fluffy head. I established letter-box communications Hole Tree. No address find me. It well known I Bird Wisdom. I also Observing Bird; though young friends may think I see less I do, blinking, I detest vulgar glare bright light without persons seem able see goes around them, I would children know I blink occasion, apt let every starer read counsel eyes, I wide awake same. I look-out it is dark folk cannot see inch noses, (a word foolish naughty!) I see behind back. And Wiseacre, Observer, Wide-awake--I Children's Owl. Before I open mouth little affairs, even I open letters (if waiting me) I explain came I Children's Owl. It owing little girl; one fluffy hair wise eyes. As Observer I noticed I, people, seem she wants, Wiseacre I reflected upon strange, her temper soft fluffy her hair (which mine not), she always seems ready give way others (which never case--if I help it). On occasion I speak of, I could _not_ help it. It last summer Bad Boy caught me, squeezed wicker cage. Little I think I ever live poked out, rummaged, torn shreds thing boy! I bit him, he got cage put cloth it. Then he took his father, took front door house, he coachman gardener, asked Little Miss come see new pet Tom caught her. "It is nasty-tempered brute, she is one taming things," said coachman, whipping cloth show housemaid, letting glare light irritated frenzy. I flew housemaid, she flew house. Then I rolled growled hissed beak, tried hide eyes feathers. "Little Miss will not tame me," I muttered. She try long. When she heard she came running out, wind blowing her fluffy hair her face, sun shining it. Fluffed wind, changing colour light shade, hair her back entirely unlike feathers own, though less sober perhaps tints. Like mine makes small head look large, she big wise eyes, I seen creatures less like owl Little Miss. Her voice hoarse mine. It clear soft, I heard she spoke: "Oh, _how_ good you! And good Tom! I love owls. I always get Mary put silver owl luncheon, though I allowed eat pepper. And I brown owl, china one, sitting book letter weight. He came Germany. And Captain Barton gave owl pencil-case birthday, I liked hearing his real owl, but, oh, I never hoped I real owl own. It _was_ kind Tom." To hear Bad Boy called kind much endurance, I let see savage I felt. If wicker work strong cage would held me. "He is Tartar," said coachman. "Oh no, Williams!" said Little Miss, "he is frightened light. Give cloth, please." "Take care, Miss. He will bite you," cried coachman, she put cloth cage, her head. "No he will not! I do not mind his snapping hissing. I want see me, know me. Then perhaps he will get like me, tame, sit nursery clock look wise. Captain Barton's owl used sit his clock. Poor fellow! Dear old owlie! Do not growl, owl. Can hoot, darling? I like hear hoot." Sometimes I sit Ivy Bush, moon shines spiders' webs reminds threads her hair, mild, sleepy night, there is nothing stirring ivy boughs; sitting, I say, blinking dream doze, I fancy I see her face close mine, day wicker work between. Our eyes looking other, fluffiness mixed wind. Then I try remember kind things she said coax leave ivy bush, go live nursery clock. But I cannot remember half. I rage time, rage miss good deal, forget good deal. I know last she left talking me, I could see her wise eyes swimming tears. Then she left alone cloth. "Well, Miss," said coachman, "you do not make much him, ye? He is Tartar, Miss, I am afraid." "I think, Williams, he is old. Captain Barton's owl little owlet he first got him. I shall never tame one, Williams, I never disappointed life. Captain Barton said he kept owl keep good wise, nobody could foolish face owl sitting his clock. He says his godfathers dead, he taken his owl his godfather. These his jokes, Williams, I set heart owl nursery clock. I think I never wished much anything world Tom's owl would Bird Wisdom. But he never will. He never let tame him. He wants wild owl his life. I love much, I like he wants, miserable. Please thank Tom much, please ask let go." "I am sorry I brought him, Miss, trouble you," said coachman. "But Tom will not let go. He would lot trouble catching him, he is good you, Tom'll glad stuff. He is got glass eyes stuffed fox moths ate, he is bent stuffing owl, Tom. The eyes would big pheasant, they will look well enough owl, he thinks." My hearing acute, word Bad Boy's brutal intentions lost me. I shrunk among feathers shivered despair; I heard voice Little Miss I rounded ear more. "No, Williams, no! He must stuffed.

He wild, he lovely soft, I want let go." "Well, Miss, I will send Tom, settle him. All I say, he is Tartar, stuffing's good him." Whether she bribed Tom, persuaded him, I do not know, Little Miss got her way, Bad Boy let go, I went back Ivy Bush. OWLHOOT I. "What cannot cured must endured." _Old Proverb._ It wish see Little Miss led wings past her nursery window; besides, I curiosity look clock. It eight-day clock, handsome case, would, undoubtedly, becoming perch bird dignified appearance, I describe to-day. Nor I speak meditations I sit Ivy Bush like common owl, reflect I way, listened Little Miss, I might sat Eight-day Clock, godfather children. It seemly owl doubt his wisdom, I taken upon me, sake Little Miss, child's counsellor, I observe, passing, though satisfactory time get way, may live wish taken folk's advice instead. From nursery I taken flight others. I sail windows, throw searching eye bars are, I believe, placed keep top-heavy babies tumbling out. Sometimes I peer chimney. From nook wall hollow tree, I overlook children's gardens playgrounds. I eye several schools, I fancy (though I may wrong) I look well seated top easel--just black-board, piece chalk feathery foot. Not I notion playing school-master, even advising school-masters parents make children good wise. I Children's Owl--their own--and good advice intended help improve themselves. It wonderful children _do_ sometimes improve! I knew fine little fellow, much made his family friends, used peevish little ups downs life, lamentable whine his voice he thwarted trifle, heard without seeing him, you would sworn miserable wretch world bewailing worst catastrophes failing breath. And handsomer, healthier, better fed, better bred, better dressed, dearly loved little boy parish. When might thought, sound it, starving skeleton creature moaning bit bread, young gentleman sobbing soap lifting his voice towels, Nurse would wash his fair rosy cheeks. And cries like one vanquished battle begging praying his life, rang hall front stairs, proved nothing worse Master Jack imploring his friends "_please, please_" "_do, do_," let stay run final "go please" race young Browns (who dine quarter hour later), instead going promptly gong sounded luncheon. Now day I peeped bedroom little boy's home. The sun up, Jack, one his numerous Aunts not. She bed headache, her pale face, her eyes shunning light like own, her hair restlessly tossed pillow bore witness. When knock came bedroom door, she started pain, lay cried--"Come in!" The door opened, one came in; outside voices little boy his nurse audible. "I want show her new coat." "You cannot, Master Jack. Your Aunt's got dreadful headache, cannot disturbed." No peevish complaints Jack: deep sigh. "I am sorry her headache; I am sorry coat. For I going out, never new again." His Aunt spoke feebly. "Nurse, I must see his coat. Let come in." Enter Jack. It his first manly suit, he trying hard manly soul beneath it, brave boy should. He came gently, conscious pride glowing his rosy cheeks his shining eyes. His cheeks red, step life warming thing, cloth suit you have used frocks. It bottle-green coat, large mother-of-pearl buttons three coachman's capes; leggings match. The beaver hat, too, new, becomingly cocked, he stood his Aunt's bedside smiled. "What fine coat, Jack!" "Made tailor, Auntie Julie. Real pockets!" "You do not say so!" He nodded. "Leggings too!" he stuck one leg sudden right angle bed; rash proceeding, boy straight little figure, hop two he kept his balance. "My dear Jack, grand. How warm must keep legs!" He shook his beaver hat. "No. They tickles. That is do." There pause. His Aunt remembered old peevish ways. She want encourage discard his winter leggings, doubtful say. But moment his eyes shone, his face took effulgent expression children resolved upon good. "--_and I cannot shake tickle, I bear it_," added little gentleman. I call little gentleman advisedly. There stronger sign high breeding young people, cheerful endurance rubs life. A temper fits one's fate, spirit rises occasion. It kind courage Gentlemen England shown time immemorial, peace war, land sea, every country climate habitable globe. Jack child Empire sun never sets, he live he like larger opportunities bearing discomfort afforded woolly worry his bottle-green leggings. I good hopes he found wanting. Some thoughts, I believe, occurred his Aunt. "That is right, Jack. What man are!" The rosy cheeks became carmine, Jack flung upon his Aunt, kissed her resounding smacks. A somewhat wrecked appearance she presented boisterous hug, recalled headache his mind, he settled beaver hat, gone astray, he said ruefully, "Is headache _very_ bad, Auntie Julie?" "Rather bad, Jack. _And I cannot shake off, I bear it._" He went away tiptoe, he carefully gently closed bedroom door behind him, he departed leaps bounds show his bottle-green coat capes, white buttons leggings match, beaver hat boot, first young Browns, General Public. As Observer, I may say sight worth seeing; Bird wisdom, I prophesy well boy. PROVERBS. Fine feathers make fine birds. Manners make man. Clowns best company; gentlemen best everywhere. Where there is there is way. All work play makes Jack dull boy. What cannot cured must endured. OWLHOOT II.
