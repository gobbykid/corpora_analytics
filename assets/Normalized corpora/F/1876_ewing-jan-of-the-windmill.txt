 JAN OF THE WINDMILL CHAPTER I. THE WINDMILLER’S WIFE.—STRANGERS.—TEN SHILLINGS A WEEK.—THE LITTLE JANUARY STORM without within! So windmiller might said, he habit putting his thoughts epigrammatic form, groan his wife growl thunder broke simultaneously upon his ear, whilst rain fell scarcely faster her tears. It far mending matters storms equally unexpected. For eight full years miller’s wife meekest women. If firm (and yet, he flattered himself, just) husband dreary straggling district, miller man. And he always justice his wife’s good qualities,—at least her good quality submission,—and would, till lately, upheld her one model domestic obedience. From day he brought home his bride, tall, pretty, perpetually smiling, tall old mill ugly old mother never smiled all, one household. At rate, old woman’s death. For her life-time her stern son paid her deference moot point, perhaps, really ruled. Between them, however, young wife moulded nicety, her voice gained weight counsels windmill harsh tones mother-in-law silenced ever. The miller one good souls live light small shrewdities (often proverbial), pique sticking point, greater virtue abide narrow rule less applied. The kernel his domestic theory was, “Never yield, never to,” he proud stuck temptations real, though hard, affection his own; now, working smoothly eight years, come this? The miller scratched his bead, looked his wife, almost amazement. She moaned, though he bade her silent; she wept, spite words hitherto effectual styptic her tears; she met commonplaces his common sense wild, miserable laughter, he shuddered he heard her. Weakness human beings like strength beasts, power fortunately always conscious. Unless positively brutal, cannot well beat sickly woman wailing weeping; she cease lesser consideration, seems nothing unbending husband leave her herself. This miller do, anyhow. For he could spare moment’s attention her then, since mill required his care. In coat hat painted canvas, he ever since storm began; directing two men working within, struggling along stage ran outside windmill, small risk fairly blown away. He reefed sails twice already teeth blinding rain. But he well careful. For storm this, five years ago “come Michaelmas,” worst windmill calamities befallen him,—the sails torn his mill dashed hundred fragments upon ground. And mishap seventy feet tower mill means—as windmillers well know—not stoppage trade, expense two hundred pounds new sails. Many sack grist, come gone watermill valley new sails work; huge debt incurred pay fairly wiped yet. That catastrophe kept windmiller poor man five years, gave nervous dread storms. And talking storms, another unreasonable thing. The morning sky (like miller’s wedded life) without cloud. The day sultry, time year unseasonably so. And, miller grudged idle day, times hard, he debt,—for small matters, well sail business,—and when, first time his life, he felt almost afraid his hearthstone, would fain busy his trade, breath wind turn sails mill. Not waft cool his perplexed forehead, breeze enough stir short grass glared miles country flat enough mock fullest possible view cloudless sky. Then towards evening, gray flecks stolen horizon like thieves dusk, mighty host clouds followed them; wind come, came moderate measure, brought awful storm upon wings, raged powers mischief got loose, bent turning every thing topsy-turvy indoors out. What made winds clouds perverse, clerk weather best knows; reason unreasonableness windmiller’s wife. She lost her child, her youngest born, therefore, present, her best beloved. This girl-babe sixth windmiller his wife’s children, last God gave them, first pleased Him take away. The mother weak herself time baby fell ill, unusually ill-fitted bear heavy blow. Then her watchful eyes seen symptoms ailing child long windmiller’s good sense would allow fuss made, expense incurred little peevishness down. And words muttered doctor he come, sent soon enough, much thing drive poor woman frantic. They struck blow, too, her blind belief miller’s invariable wisdom. If he listened her matter, love’s sake! There something, she thought, woman said came help her last offices,—the miller discouraged “neighbors,” matter decency,—that foolish man say babies housework would his wife want her word workshop mill. Perhaps state subjection grown-up people tend make reasonable, especially indignations. The windmiller’s wife dared not, her life, told many words she thought would joint benefit he would give little consideration her wishes opinions; suppressed idea came many sharp peevish words time, which, apart true source, quite unreasonable perverse miller held be. Nor completely control another, self-control. It may doubted even much teach it. The thread her passive condition been, time, broken grief, bereaved mother moaned wailed, rocked herself, beat her breast, turned fiercely upon interference, like poor beast anguish. She clung her children almost morbid tenderness, proportion she found her worthy husband stern cold. A hard husband sometimes makes soft mother, perhaps upon baby family her repressed affections outpoured fully. It case, rate. And little one unearthly beauty seen, imagined, children die young. And poor woman suffered striven it, keep it. The critical grew illness, intenser grew her strength resolution watchfulness, every means her instinct experience could suggest, fight win battle death. And vain, maddening thought tortured her might saved. The miller made mistake, pity he made another top it, best intentions. He hurried funeral, hoping “all over” mother would “settle down.” But crowning insult her agony, shortening brief time she could watch remained her her child, drove her completely wild. She reproached plainly bitterly enough. She would neither listen reason obey; when—with truth taste—he observed people lost children, plenty left, she laughed his face wild laugh drove back mill storm. How raged! The miller’s wife uneducated, commonplace woman enough, but, excited state her nervous system, she sensible poet kind comforting harmony wild sounds without; though another time would frightened her. They disturb children, bed. Four old press-bed corner, one battered crib, one narrow bed coverlet yet green. The day’s work her, though beginning miller, mother nothing weep, her tears fell fell, rain poured poured. That last outburst somewhat relieved her, she almost wished her husband would come back, flash lightning dazzled her eyes, thunder rattled round old mill, sails broken again, falling upon roof round-house. All her senses acute to-night, she listened miller’s footsteps, so, listening, lull thunder, she heard another sound. Wheels upon road. A pang shot her heart. Thus doctor’s gig sounded night he came,—alas, late! How long intensely she listened that! She first heard beyond mile-stone. This one must good bit side it; hill, fact. She could help listening. It like, terribly like! Now spun along level ground. Ah, doctor hurried so! Now mill, door, and—it stopped. The miller’s wife rose run out, she hardly knew why. But moment she checked herself, went back her seat. “I crazed, surely,” said poor woman, sitting again. “There gigs one world, folk often stops ask way maester.” These travellers long time putting simple question, especially night pleasant one linger in. The murmur voices, too, woman overheard, betokened close conversation, familiar drawl windmiller’s dialect blended audibly kind clean-clipt speaking peculiar gentlefolk. “He have talking master’s five minute an’ more,” muttered miller’s wife. “What ’ee want un?” The talking ceased she spoke, windmiller appeared, followed woman carrying young baby her arms. He ruddy man his age time, extra flush his cheeks now, excitement his manner, making look his wife will not see year, Foresters’ dinner Heart Oak. There difference, too. A little much drink made windmiller peevish pompous, he spoke kindly, almost conciliating tone. “See, missus! Let good lady dry herself bit, get warm, little un too.” A woman—ill-favored, though positive fault found her features, except upper lip long cleft, lower one large—came forward child, began take wraps, miller’s wife, giving her face hasty wipe, went hospitably help her. “Tst! tst! little love!” she cried, gulping sob, due her sad memories, moving cloak tenderly woman whose arms child lay. “What pair dark eyes, then! Is’t boy girl, m’m?” “A boy,” said voice door, miller’s wife, suppressed shriek timidity, became aware man whose entrance she perceived, she dropped hasty courtesy. He man slightly middle height, whose slenderness made seem taller. An old cloak, intended much disguise protect him, quite conceal faultlessness costume beneath it, fashion day. Waistcoats three kinds, one within other, frilled shirt, well-adjusted stock, seen, though he held ends old cloak tightly across him, wind would caught doorway. He wore countryman’s hat, seemed suit little cloak, beneath brim his dark eyes glared restless, dissatisfied look, dark fierce bright one could hardly see details his face, unless his smooth chin, which, either habit stiffness his stock, he carried strangely air. “Indeed, sir,” said windmiller’s wife, courtesying, setting chair, her eyes wandering back kind fascination stranger; “be pleased take seat, sir.” The stranger sat moment, stood again. Then he seemed remember he still wore his hat, removed it, holding stiffly his gloved hands. This displayed high, narrow head, natural hair worn short without parting, face which, though worn, old. And, definable reason, impression stole windmiller’s wife he, like her husband, wish conciliate, his case struggled hard different kind feeling, natural him. Then he took watch would called old turnip shape, said impatiently miller, “Our time short, good man.” “To sure, sir,” said windmiller. “Missus! word here.” And he led way round-house, his wife followed, wondering. Her wonder lessened he laid his hand upon her shoulder, and, flushed cheek tone excitement recalled Foresters’ annual meeting, said, “We have sore times, missus, late, good luck come way to-night.” “And then, maester?” faltered his wife. “That child,” said windmiller, turning his broad thumb expressively towards inner room, “belongs folk want get home un, afford pay un, too. And place healthy way, heard trouble, bereaved little un”— “No! no! no!” shrieked poor mother, understood all. “I _couldn’t_, maester, it is unpossible, I could _not_. Oh dear! oh dear! is not bad enough lose sweetest child ever saw light, without taking outcast fill dear angel’s place? Oh dear! oh dear!” “And behindhand quarters one,” continued miller, prudently ignoring his wife’s tears remonstrances, “and dear season coming on, uncertain trade keeps man idle days together, here is ten shillings week dropped laps, speak. Ten shillings week—regular sartin. No less now, hereafter, governor said. Them his words.” “What is ten shilling week me, child dead gone?” moaned mother, reply. “_What’s ten shillings week you_?” cried windmiller, fairly exasperated, tones loud audible dwelling room, stranger, standing three-legged table, stroked his lips twice thrice his hand, smooth cynical smile strove disturb decorous somewhat haughty compression. “What is ten shilling week you? Why, it is food you, drink you, firing you, boots children’s feet. Look here, woman. You have sore affliction, that is say you are throw good luck dirt whimsey. This matter’s settled.” And miller strode back inner room, whilst his wife sat upon sack barley, wringing her hands, moaning, “I could not duty un, maester, I could not duty un.” This she repeated intervals, her apron her face, before; then, suddenly aware her husband left her, she hurried inner room plead her because. It late. The strangers gone. The miller there, baby lay end press bedstead, wailing bitterly mother herself. It placed there, big bundle clothes it, miller came back, he found so. He found stranger too, his hat his head, his cloak fastened, glancing time time child, withdrawing his glance hastily, looking forcedly round meagre furnishing miller’s room, back little bundle bed, away again. The woman stood her back press-bed, her striped shawl drawn tightly round her, her hands folded together closely her long lip pressed heavy one below. “Is settled?” asked man. “It is, sir,” said miller. “You will excuse missus she is, it is fretting child we have lost”— “I understand, I understand,” said stranger, hastily. He pulling back rings silk netted purse, he drawn mechanically his pocket, which, sudden start his, fell chinking floor. Whatever thought startled him, he thought sharply he looked fear he said aloud. But he spoken, miller expression eager satisfaction his face stranger counted gold flaring light tallow candle. “A quarter’s pay advance,” he said briefly. “It paid quarterly, understand.” After which, checking look towards child, he went out, followed woman. In round-house he paused however, looked back meagre, dimly lighted room, little bundle upon bed lay weeping. For moment, storm irresolution seemed seize him, muttering, “It cannot helped present, cannot helped,” he hurried towards vehicle, back seat woman already seated. The driver touched his hat he approached, turned cushion, he protecting rain. The stranger stumbled cloak he got in, and, cursing step, bade man drive like something connection driving. But, turned, windmiller ran them. “Stop, sir!” he cried. “Well, now?” said stranger, sharply, horse pulled back his haunches. “Is named?” gasped miller. “Oh, yes, sort thing,” impatient reply. “And name?” asked miller. “January J, A, N,” said stranger, shouting blustering wind. “And—and—the name?” said windmiller, standing close stranger’s ear. “What yours?” he asked, sharp look his dark eyes. “Lake—Abel,” said windmiller. “It his also, henceforth,” said stranger, waving his hand, close subject,—“Jan Lake. Drive on, you?” The horse started forward, whirled away wet, gray road. And miller regained his mill, carriage distant speck upon storm. CHAPTER II. THE MILLER’S CALCULATIONS.—HIS HOPES AND FEARS.—THE NURSE-BOY.—CALM. THE windmiller went back his work. He risked something business leaving mill hands others, even short time. Then storm abated somewhat. The wind went round, blew less violence fine steady breeze. The miller began think going dwelling-room bit supper carry his night’s work. And yet he lingered returning his wife her present mood. He stuck sharp point his windmiller’s candlestick {14} sack stood near, drawing yellow canvas “sample bag”—which served purse—from depths his pocket, he began count coins light candle. He counted several times increasing satisfaction, made several slow sure calculations sum ten shillings week month, quarter, half, whole year. He began another set calculations kind less pleasant, especially honest man,—his debts. “There is good bit doctor times,” he murmured; “and there is coffin, something Heart Oak bearers, couple bottles red wine there, too, missus, she bad. And boys new shoes follow in,—she would follow”— And on, on, windmiller ran list his petty debts, saw his way paying them. Then he put money back sample bag, folded neatly, stowed away. And he drew near inner door, peeped room. His poor wife seemed better case before. She sat old rocking-chair, swinging backwards forwards, beating her hands upon her knees silence, making movement comfort wailing little creature bed. For first time came upon windmiller sense fact uncertain rather dangerous game drive desperate woman corner. His missus soft-hearted soul ever lived, her sit unmoved weeping neglected child proof something far wrong indeed. One two nasty stories tender-hearted women done “crazed” grief haunted him. The gold seemed grow hot bottom his pocket. He wished he got stranger’s name address, case desirable annul bargain. He wished missus would cry again, silence worse thing. He wished happen come his head her grandmother went “melancholy mad” she left young widow, she uncle business died softening brain. He wished she would move across room take child, intensity almost amounted prayer. And, votive spirit generally comes moments, he mentally resolved that, his missus would “take to” infant, he would humor her points best his power. A strange fulfilment often treads heels vows. At moment wailing baby disturbed miller’s eldest son he lay press-bed. He seven years old, he nurse-boy his dead sister brief period her health,—the exclusively so, miller’s wife weakly,—and watched her sick cradle grief scarcely less mother. He crept coverlet wailing heap clothes, bright, puzzled look his chubby face. “Mother,” he said, “mother! Is little un come back?” “No, no!” she cried. “That is our’n. It is—it is another one.” “Have Lord sent us another?” said boy, lifting peak little hood baby’s eye, hanging, fairly gathering tiny creature, great effort, his arms, daring child accustomed playing nurse one nearly heavy himself. “I glad that, mother. The Lord sent one night, too, mother; night slept round-house. Do ’ee mind? Whishty, whishty, love! Eh, mother, eyes! Whishty, whishty, then! _I’m_ seeing thee, I am.” There something like sob miller’s throat, his wife rose, and, running bed, fell her knees, burst weeping thaw bitter grief gathered her eldest child little outcast together her bosom. At moment another head poked bedclothes, second child began say say, hoping, perhaps, thereby get share attention kisses well other. “I seed lady genle’m,” broke forth, “and feared un. They going doors. The genle’m look back us, lady went right on. I didn’ see her face.” Matters domestic straightforward condition, windmiller longer hesitated come in. But he less disposed hard triumphant self-satisfaction common his ended well. A poor unsuccessful career had, indeed, something hardness his nature, flush prosperity he felt softened, resolved inwardly “let missus take her time,” come back her ordinary condition without interference. “Shall un bit supper, missus?” his cheerful greeting coming in. “But take time,” he added, seeing her busy baby, “take time.” By-and-by nurse-boy took child, woman bustled supper. She still half reconciled, slapped plates table uncommon irritability. The windmiller ate hearty supper washed well home-made ale, satisfactory feeling he could pay he wanted it. And he began plug his pipe tobacco, his wife rocked new-comer her breast, he said thoughtfully,— “Do ’ee think, missus, woman ’ud mother un?” “Mother!” cried his wife, scornfully. “She’ve never mother, maester; one. To see her handle enough me. The boy could see she never much looked back un. To bring infant night like this, too, leave strangers. Mother, indeed, says he!” “Take time, missus, take time!” murmured miller his head. He speak aloud, he puffed his pipe. “Do suppose genle’m father, missus?” he suggested, he rose go back his work. “Maybe,” said his wife, briefly; “I cannot speak one way another feelings men-folk.” This blow hit straight out, windmiller forbore reply. He altogether ill-pleased it, woman’s unwonted peevishness broke new tears child, she bore away bed, pouring forth half inarticulate indignation unnatural parents. “She’ve soft heart, missus,” said windmiller, thoughtfully, he went outer door. “I am doubts she will not take her yet. But she shall her time.” The storm passed. The wolds lay glistening dreary watery sky, still. The windmiller looked upwards mechanically. To weatherwise part his trade. But his thoughts clouds to-night. He brought sample bag, without thinking it, surface his pocket, dropped slowly back again, murmuring, “Ten shilling week.” And he turned his night’s work he added, nod complete conviction, “It will more’n keep _he_.” CHAPTER III. THE WINDMILLER’S WORDS COME TRUE.—THE RED SHAWL.—IN THE CLOUDS.—NURSING V. PIG-MINDING.—THE ROUND-HOUSE.—THE MILLER’S THUMB. STRANGE say, windmiller’s idea came true time,—the foster-child favorite. He youngest family, mother children. This goes something. Then, she got her repugnance adopting him, he much heal old grief, fill empty place her heart well cradle. He frail, fretful little creature, red face fading yellow, much golden his little pate would furnish moth plumage, eyes like sloe-berries. It fortunate rather otherwise he ailing weeks good wife’s anxieties came again, and, triumph time successful, much bitterness old loss passed away. In month’s time he looked healthy, absolutely handsome. The windmiller’s wife, indeed, protested he lovely, she never wearied marvelling unnatural conduct found hearts intrust sweet child care strangers; though must confessed nothing would pleased her less arrival two doting conscientious parents reclaim him. Indeed, pity much large measure love she gave deserted child. A meaner sentiment, too, quite without influence predominance he gradually gained his foster brothers sisters. There little enough proud could guessed his parentage (the windmiller knew nothing), scope amount fancy; child displayed better manners talents children, Mrs. Lake would purse her lips, say, somewhat shabby pride,— “Anybody may see it is gentry born.” “I have thinking,” said windmiller, one day, “that woman were not mother, it is likely mother’s dead.” “It Is likely, too,” said his wife; her kindness abounded towards motherless child. Little Abel nurse-boy it, he his sister. Not much baby himself, he would wrap old shawl round baby quite baby, stagger carefully door, drop dexterously—baby uppermost—on short, dry grass lay miles mill. The shawl special shawl, though old. It red, bright color seemed take child’s fancy; he never good playing upon gay old rag. His black eyes would sparkle, his tiny fingers clutch it, mother put he swayed Abel’s courageous grasp. And Abel would spread him, like eastern prayer carpet, shadow old mill. Little need he medicine, fresh strong air blew downs filling his little lungs day. Little he want toys, he lay his red shawl gazing upwards hour hour, Abel point every change vast field view. It part windmiller’s trade study heavens, Abel may inherited taste looking skywards. Then, great open downs much sky seen, hardly help seeing it, much else look at. Had lived village street, even lane, Abel his charge might taken amusements,—to games, grubbing hedges, amid endless treasures ditches. But was, lay hour hour looked sky, open picture-book ever-changing leaves. “Look ’ee here!” nurse-boy would cry. “See crows, pretty black crows! Eh, lapwing! Lap-py, lap-py, lap-py, he go! Janny catch un!” And baby would stretch his arms responsive Abel’s expressive signs, cry aloud vanishing bird. If living creature crossed ether, clouds. Sometimes long triangular mass small white fleecy clouds would stretch across half heavens, shortest side upon horizon, point zenith, one white fleece seemed leading gradually widening flock across sky. “See then!” nurse-boy would cry. “See pretty sheep yonder! Janny mind un! So! so!” And small gray scud, floating lower, ran past far-away cirrus, Abel would add quaint seriousness, “It Is sheep-dog. How he runs then! Bow-wow!” At sunset flock wore golden fleeces, them, crimson hues them, little Jan stretched his fingers, crowed, he would clutched western sky he clutched his red shawl. But Abel better pleased when, dusk, flock became dark gray. “They Master Salter’s pigs now,” said he. For pigs Abel’s native place plentiful black; he herded Master Salter’s flock (five twenty black, three spotted) whole month his services required nurse-boy his sister. But coming new baby, he would probably gone back pigs. And he preferred babies. A baby demands attention well herd pigs, get home. It run twenty-eight different directions, think safely turned corner village. Master Salter’s swine suffered neglect hands several successors office Abel held, Master Salter—whilst alluding indignant terms “young varments,” “gallus-birds,” forth—was pleased express his regret gentle trustworthy Abel given pig-minding nursing. The pigs’ loss baby’s gain. No tenderer careful nurse could little Jan had. And he throve apace. The windmiller took notice he will not his children babyhood. He never playful indulgent father, he watched considerable interest child who, unconsciously, bringing much “grist mill.” When weather fine enough doors, Abel would play his charge round-house, windmiller never drove mill, one time he would done. Now then, too, he would pat little Jan’s head, bestow word praise his careful guardian. It may well, by-the-by, explain round-house is. Some brick tower mills widen gradually evenly base. Others widen abruptly lowest story, stands round bottom mill, roof running round too. The projection is, fact, additional passage, encircling bottom story windmill. It round-house. If take pill-box represent basement floor tower-mill, put another pill-box two three sizes larger it, got circular passage two boxes, added round-house mill. The round-house commonly used kind store-room. Abel Lake’s windmill separate dwelling-house. His grandfather built windmill, even his father left son add dwelling-house, he perhaps extended his resources bit farming business, windmillers often add trade proper. But calamity broken sails left Abel Lake power outlay many years, he content live mill. The dwelling-room inner part basement floor. Near door led round-house ladder leading next story, close opening sacks grain drawn above. The story basement held millstones “smutting” machine, cleaning dirty wheat. The next held dressing machine, bran separated flour. In next corn-bins. To next grain drawn basement first instance. The top story held machinery connected turning sails. Ladders led story story, room two windows opposite sides mill. Use second nature, sounds haunt windmill soon familiar pleasant little Jan he born windmiller’s son. Through many windy night he slept soundly sailor breeze might disturb nerves land-lubber. And north wind blew keen steadily, chains jangled sacks grist went upwards, millstones ground monotonous music his head, sounds lullaby his slumbers, disturbed troubled his foster-mother, revolving stones ground homely welcome measure: “Dai-ly bread, dai-ly bread, dai-ly bread.” For another sign his true child mill, his nurse Abel anxiously watched. Though Abel preferred nursing pig-minding, he higher ambition yet, begin his career windmiller. It likely he could use his father year two, fact he great use his mother naturally tended delay his promotion mill. Mrs. Lake never allowed say her husband, she seemed unable, certainly unwilling, say her children. Happily, her eldest child sweet docile temper spoiling little harm; even her inability say got mother difficulties. She obliged invent excuses “fub off,” she could neither consent refuse. So, Abel used cling her, crying, “Mother dear, when’ll I put t’help father mill? Do ’ee ask un let come now! I able sweep ’s well Gearge. I sweeps room thee,”—she heart courage say, “I want thee, thy father does not,” she would take boy’s hand tenderly hers, making believe examine his thumbs purpose, would reply, “Wait bit, love. Thee’s sprack boy, good un, thee’s rightly got miller’s thumb.” And thus came Abel ever sifting bits flour his finger thumb, obtain required flatness delicacy marks latter miller born; playing lovingly little Jan floor round-house, he would pass baby’s fingers also, crying,— “Sift un, Janny! sift un! Thee’s miller’s lad, thee must miller’s thumb.” CHAPTER IV. BLACK AS SLANS.—VAIR AND VOOLISH.—THE MILLER AND HIS MAN. IT great important time Abel Jan learned walk; but, he neither precocious behindhand respect, his biographer may pardoned dwelling length. He charming demure little face, chiefly differing faces children district overwhelming superiority matter forehead. Mrs. Lake great hopes he would differ another respect also. Most children neighborhood fair. Not fair many North-country children are, locks differing, equally brilliant, shades gold, auburn, red, bronze; white-headed, often white-faced, white-lashed inexpressive eyes, bleaching several generations. Now, dark bright eyes little Jan first came tender interest Mrs. Lake, she fully hoped, constantly prophesied, he would “as black rook;” style complexion she gave distinct preference, though miller fair nature well white trade. Jan’s eyes seemed conclusive. “Black slans be,” said his foster-mother. And slans meant sloe-berries Mrs. Lake born. An old local saying something perhaps her views:— “Lang lazy, Black proud; Vair voolish, Little loud.” “Fair foolish” youngsters certainly abounded neighborhood extent justified wish change. As pride, meek Mrs. Lake far regarding failing thing proud of, black hair possible connection gentry. And fate denied her chance proud aggressive her account, she derived curious sort second-hand satisfaction seeing qualities belonged her. It extent console her miller’s roughness herself, hear rating George. And she got sort reflected dignity able say, “My maester’s man his way.” But her hopes realized. That yellow beefsteak stage Jan’s infant complexion faded destined deepen gipsy hues. It gave place tints China rose, wind sunshine downs could tan, though sometimes burnt, his cheeks. The hair his little head became abundant, kept golden hue. His eyes remained dark,—a curious mixture; hair complexion he irredeemably fair. The mill least one “vair voolish” inmate, common account, though his (given confidence intimate friends) he “not zuch vool he looked.” This George Sannel, miller’s man. Master Lake second hand help stormy night Jan made his first appearance mill; rule he kept one man, he hired year time, mop hiring fair held yearly next town. George, Gearge he commonly called, two years windmill, looked upon respects “one family.” He slept truckle-bed round-house, which, though average size, would permit stretch his legs recklessly without exposing his feet cold. For “Gearge” six feet one three-quarters his stockings. He face respects like big baby’s. He turn-up nose, large smooth cheeks, particularly innocent expression, forehead hardly worth naming, small dull eyes, tendency inflammation lids may possibly hindered lashes growing, mouth generally open, he neither eating sucking “bennet.” When countenance bathed flour, might open question whether improved no. It certainly looked “vairer” “voolish!” There evidence show he “lazy,” well “lang,” yet he Master Lake contrived pull together. Either his character childlike his face, because—if stupid slothful nature—he also submissive, susceptible, willing temper he disarmed justest wrath; he was, he said, fool he looked, his lubberly way taken measure masterful windmiller nicety, George’s flagrant acts neglect never yet secured his dismissal. Indeed, really difficult realize one lavish willingness word wilfully culpably fail deed. “I uncommon vool, maester, sartinly,” blubbered George one occasion miller point turning off, preliminary step road “gallus,” Master Lake expressed his belief he “sartin sure come to.” And, he spoke, George made dismal daubs his befloured face his sleeve, he rubbed his eyes his arm elbow wrist. “Sech governor be, too!” he continued. “Poor mother! she allus said I come good, gawney I be! No I should not you, Master Lake, a-keeping on. Give un another chance, sir, ’ee! I mortal stoopid, sir, I would work fingers bwoan likes you, Master Lake!” George stayed on, though next time windmiller absent his “voolish” assistant get much toll-dish corn ground flour, he full penitence promises he weathered tempest many succeeding one. On eventful night storm, Jan’s arrival, George’s neglect risked recurrence sail catastrophe. At least second man’s report trusted. This man complained windmiller that, his absence strangers, George, instead doubling his vigilance men left short-handed, taken pretext attending direction wind position sails outside, important matter, he not, all, paid slightest heed; he himself, whilst leaving mill fate fury storm, his indignant fellow-servant professed “blessed he knew.” But people grateful informed misconduct servants. It reflection one’s judgment. And unpardonable George’s conduct was, tale true, words he couched his self-defence much grateful ears windmiller somewhat free independent style man expressed his opinion George’s conduct qualities, master took his servant’s part, snubbed informer his pains. In justice George, too, said he stoutly repeatedly denied whole story, many oaths imprecations horrible calamities upon he lying smallest particular. And reiteration steady, countenance guileless unmoved, contrast favorably face man, whose voice trembled whose forehead flushed, either overwhelming indignation guilty consciousness he bearing false witness. Master Lake employed more, George stayed on. But, matter, Master Lake’s disposition one permitted profit best qualities connected him. He bit tyrant, one man, six times clever, ten times hard-working George, gone George would stayed, crossing words windmiller. The safety priceless sails, true, risked man he kept, secured man he sent away, Master Lake quite satisfied his decision. “I bean’t fond men mortal sprack fussy strange place,” miller observed Mrs. Lake reference matter. Mrs. Lake picked several her husband’s bits proverbial wisdom, she often flattered retailing his face. “Too hot hold, mostly,” her reply, knowing tones. “Ay, ay, missus, be,” said windmiller. And he added, “Gearge slow, sartinly, mortal slow; Gearge sure.” CHAPTER V. THE POCKET-BOOK AND THE FAMILY BIBLE.—FIVE POUNDS’ REWARD. OF strange gentleman brought Jan windmill, Lakes heard more, money paid regularly lawyer London. From lawyer, indeed, Master Lake heard immediately arrival his foster-son. The man business wrote say gentleman visited mill certain night had, date, lost pocket-book, he thought might picked mill. It contained papers valuable owner, also five-pound note, liberally offered windmiller he could find book, forward once. Master Lake began kind reckless, gambling sort feeling luck. Here would easily earned five pounds, he could luck find missing property! That ten shillings week come pretty easily him. When said, _are_ people whose mouths larks fall ready cooked! The windmiller looked inside mill outside mill, wandered long way along chalky road his eyes downwards, he nearer five-pound note his pains. Then he went his wife, she seen nothing pocket-book; her husband somewhat unreasonably observed that, “A might zartin _thee_ could not help un!” He next betook George, slowly, hoped surely, sweeping round-house. “Gearge, boy,” said windmiller, anxious tones, “have ’ee seen pocket-book lying anywheres?” George leaned upon his broom one hand, scratched his white head. “What pocket-book, then, Master Lake?” said he, grinning, his ignorance. “Thee’s eerd pocket-book now, thee vool, sure-ly!” said impatient windmiller. “I’se eerd pocket hops, Master Lake,” said George, irritating pause, he still smiled, scratched his poll stimulate recollection. “Book—book—book! pocket-_book_!” shouted miller. “If thee cannot read, thee knows book is, thee gawney!” “What vool I be, sure!” said George, his simple countenance lighted broader smile before. “I knows book, sartinly, Master Lake, I knows book. There is one,” George continued, speaking even slower before,—“there is one inzide, sir,—a big un. On shelf be. A Vamly Bible calls un. And I am sartin sure there,” he concluded, “for has not moved since last time christened, Master Lake.” The miller turned away, biting his lip hard, repress useless outburst rage, George, still smiling sweetly, spun broom dexterously his hands, man spins water stable mop. Just Master Lake got beyond earshot, George lowered broom, began scratch his head more. “I proper vool, sartinly,” said he; miller heard this, he turned back. “Mother allus said I would sense yead dumbledore,” George candidly confessed. And dumbledore he meant humble-bee. “It take time mind thing, sir.” “Well, never mind, Gearge,” said miller; “if thee’s slow, thee’s sure. What ’ee remember book, now, Gearge? A do not mind giving thee five shilling, thee finds un, Gearge.” “A un burying, I ’member quite well now, sir. To put little un’s name it was. I thowt had not zince christening, I stoopid sartinly.” “What talking about, ye vool?” roared miller. “The book, sir, sartinly,” said George, his honest face beaming good-humor. “The Vamly Bible, Master Lake.” And windmiller went muttering something Family Bible would means sanctioned, George returned chuckling leisurely use his broom round-house floor. Master Lake find pocket-book, day two advertised local paper, reward five pounds offered it. George Sannel seated one evening “Heart Oak” inn, sipping excellent home-brewed ale, warmed his consumption curious funnel-shaped pipkin, his long lop-ears caught remark made inn-keeper, reading bits local paper small audience, unable read themselves. “Five pound reward!” he read. “Lor massy! There sum easily earned sharp-eyed chap good luck ’s side.” “And then, Master Chuter?” said George, pausing, steaming mug half-way his lips. “Haw, haw!” roared inn-keeper: “you sharp-eyed chap, too! Do ’ee think ’twould suit thee, Gearge? Thee’s sprack chap, sartinly, Gearge!” “Haw, haw, haw!” roared members company, slowly realized Master Chuter’s irony expense “voolish” Gearge. George took rough banter excellent part. He sipped his beer, grinned like cat his expense. But guffaws subsided, he said, “Thee’s told un five pound yet, Master Chuter.” The curiosity company time aroused, Master Chuter explained: “It Is gentleman name Ford advertising pocket-book, seems lost downs, near Master Lake’s windmill. It Is thy way, too, Gearge, all. Thee must get yarly, Gearge. It Is yarly bird catches worm. And tell Master Lake me,  will young varments place driving pigs his mill, look pocket-book, makes believe minding pigs.” “It Is likely, too,” said George. And two three aged laborers smocks, one lubberly boy, composed rest circle, added, severally collectively, “It Is likely, too.” But, George beat his way home downs dusk, he said aloud, cover roaring wind, security open country,— “Vive pound! vive pound! And offered vive shilling un. Master Lake, dog-ged cute; Gearge bean’t quite vool looks.” After short time advertisement withdrawn. CHAPTER VI. GEORGE GOES COURTING.—GEORGE AS AN ENEMY.—GEORGE AS A FRIEND.—ABEL PLAYS SCHOOL-MASTER.—THE LOVE-LETTER.—MOERDYK.—THE MILLER-MOTH.—AN ANCIENT DITTY. ONE day George Sannel asked obtained leave holiday. On morning question, he dressed cleanest smocks, greased his boots, stuck bloody warrior, dark-colored wallflower, his bosom, put neatly folded, clean cotton handkerchief his pocket,—which, even he use it, piece striking dandyism,—and scrubbed his honest face point cleanliness Mrs. Lake almost constrained remark she thought he must going courting. George blush,—he never blushed,—but he looked “voolish” enough warrant suspicion his errand tender one, he reason give his spruce appearance. It was, perhaps, his confusion he managed convey mistaken notion place he going Mrs. Lake. She impression he went neighboring town, whereas he went one exactly opposite direction, miles farther away. He went bank, too, seems unlikely place tender tryst; George’s proceedings apt less direct simplicity his looks speech would led stranger suppose. When he reached home, windmiller his family going bed, night still, mill idle. George betook his truckle-bed stood round-house, proceeded light his mill-candlestick, stuck wall. From chink stuck he counted seven bricks downwards, seventh yielded slight effort came out. It door, speak, hole wall mill, he drew morocco-bound pocket-book. After uneasy glance his shoulder, make sure long dark shadow stretched his heels, shifted draught candle flared, windmiller creeping behind him, he took letter book held light read it. But he never turned page, last replaced sigh. Then he put pocket-book back hole, pushed his handkerchief, tied round something chinked he pressed in. Then he replaced brick, went bed. He said nothing bank morning hole mill-wall; he parried Mrs. Lake’s questions gawky grins well-assumed bashfulness. Abel overheard his mother’s jokes subject “Gearge’s young ’ooman,” recurred he George formed curious alliance, demands explanation. It solely windmiller looked favorably upon little Jan he Abel allowed wander business parts windmill, could doors, extent never permitted children. Part change due change miller’s man. However childlike respects himself, George fond children, he hitherto seemed particular spite Abel. He, quite often miller, would drive boy round-house, thwart his fancy climbing ladders see processes different floors. Abel would happy hours together watching great stones grind, corn poured golden showers hopper way stones below. Many time he crept hidden behind sack; George seemed impish ingenuity discovering his hiding-places, would drive dog worries cat, crying, “Come out, thee little varment! Master Lake he do not allow thee hereabouts.” The cleverness miller’s man discovering poor Abel’s retreats probably arose fact he rooted dislike routine work his daily duties he would rather employ mill way attending mill-business, his idleness stupidity work equalled his industry shrewdness mischief. Poor Abel dread great, gawky, mischievous-looking man, probably prevented his complaining his mother many sly pinch buffet he endured him. And George took pains keep wholesome awe himself, vague terrifying speeches, trick he called “dropping on” poor Abel dusk, hideous grimaces uncouth sounds. He came thus upon Abel upper floor, boy fled hastily he caught his foot ladder fell headlong. Though must quite uncertain moments whether Abel broken his neck, miller’s man displayed anxiety. He clapped his hands upon his knees, sort uncouth ecstasy spite, saying, “Down comes vlump, like twoad roost. Haw, haw, haw!” Happily, Abel fell little damage mill-cats experienced many tumble, fled tormenting George. But, this, small surprise Abel found object attentions miller’s man, bore look friendliness. At first, George made civil speeches, invited Abel “see stwones a-grinding,” he felt additional terror, convinced mischief meant reality. But, days weeks went by, he wandered unmolested floor floor, many kindly word George, single cuff nip, sweet-tempered Abel began feel gratitude, almost affection, his quondam tormentor. George, his part, hitherto done violence his feelings his constant refusal allow Abel help sweep mill couple sacks lifting. He would glad put his work shoulders another, vexatious thought he would giving pleasure he wanted annoy. And his unamiable disposition malice stronger quality even idleness. But now, reason best known himself, he wished win Abel’s regard, slight recompense restraining his love tormenting he got good deal work Abel odd moments miller away. So well he manage this, marked improvement tidiness round-house drew praise his master. “Thee’ll sprack man yet, Gearge,” said windmiller, encouragingly. “Thee takes broom corners now.” “So I do,” said George, unblushingly, “so I do. But lor, Master Lake, man notice un!” George’s kinder demeanor towards Abel began shortly coming little Jan, George accounted following manner:— “You kind now, Gearge,” said Abel, gratefully, he stood one day, baby his arms, watching miller’s man emptying sack grain hopper. “I likes see thee babby, Abel,” said George, pausing his work. “Thee’s good boy, Abel, careful. I likes thing thee, Abel.” “I wish I could thing thee, Gearge,” said Abel; “but I small help likes you, Gearge.” “If you are small, you are sprack,” said miller’s man. “Thee’s good scholar, too, Abel. I will bound thee read, now? And poor gawney like I does not know’s letters.” “I read bit, Gearge,” said Abel, pride; “but I have home goodish while; mother says she will send I school spring, little un gets well walks.” “I wish I could read,” said George, mournfully; “but time’s past go school, Abel; who would teach great lummakin vool like I his letters?” “I would, Gearge, I would!” cried Abel, his eyes sparkling earnestness. “I teach thee thy letters, time thee’s learned I know, maybe I will school again, learned more.” This foundation curious kind friendship Abel miller’s man. On shelf “Vamly Bible,” alluded to, real old horn-book, belonged windmiller’s grandmother. It simply sheet letters alphabet, words one syllable, printed, protected frame transparent front thin horn, letters could read, one sees prints ground-glass “drawing slates.” From horn-book Abel labored patiently teaching George his letters. It light task. George cunning shrewdness he credited himself; denser head intellectual effort could hardly found seeking. Still struggled on, George went mill he might heard muttering,— “A B C G. No! Cuss vool! A B C _D_. Why did not whop letters I boy? A B C”—and persevering industry he commonly kept works mischief. One evening he brought home newspaper Heart Oak, Mrs. Lake taken baby, he persuaded Abel come round-house give lesson. Abel could read much George quite overwhelmed his learning. “Thee be’s mortal larned, Abel, sartinly. But I will never read like thee,” he added, despairingly. “Drattle th’ old witch; did not she give I schooling?” He spoke spiteful emphasis, Abel, well used his rough language notice uncivil reference his mother, said compassion,— “Were never sent school then, Gearge?” “They ha’ kept there,” said George, self-defensively. “I played moocher,” he continued,—by he meant truant,—“and whopped I, went home mother, she kept un home, old vool!” “Well, Gearge, thee must work hard, I will teach thee, Gearge, I will teach thee!” said little Abel, proudly. “And by-and-by, Gearge, we will get slate, I will teach thee write too, Gearge, I will!” George’s small eyes gave slight squint, apt he thinking profoundly. “Abel,” said he, “can thee read writing, boy?” “I think I could, Gearge,” said Abel, “if it was pretty plain.” “Abel, boy,” said George, pause, broad sweet smile upon his “voolish” face, “go door see wind rising all; us must not forget th’ old mill, Abel, us larning. Sartinly not, Abel, mun.” Proud implied partnership care mill, Abel hastened outer door. As he passed inner one, leading dwelling-room, he could hear his mother crooning strange, drony, old local ditty, she put little Jan sleep. As Abel went out, she singing first verse:— “The swallow twitters barn, The rook cawing tree, And wood ringdove coos, But false love hath fled me.” Abel opened door, looked out. One small white moths known “millers” went past him. The night still,—so utterly still sound sort whatever broke upon ear. In dead silence loneliness stood mill. Even miller-moth gone; cat ran Abel’s legs, loneliness without much her. The sky gray. Abel went back round-house, George struggling fix candlestick securely wall. “Cuss thing!” he exclaimed, whilst skin his face took mottled hue nearest approach he ever made blush. “The tallow’ve dropping, Abel, boy. I think it was wind opened door, maybe. And I have trying fix un firmly. That is all, Abel; that is all.” “There are not signs wind,” said Abel. “It is main quiet unked outside, Gearge. And I think like rain. There miller-moth, Gearge; mean thing?” “I cannot say,” said George. “I bean’t weatherwise myself, Abel. But wind, work, Abel; us may go back larning. Look here, boy,” he added, Abel reseated grain-sack duty chair instruction, drawing, he spoke, letter forth light; “come candle, Abel, see thee read this, do not tell one I showed thee, Abel.” “Not me, Gearge,” said Abel, warmly; he added,—“Be thy young ’ooman, Gearge?” No rustic swain ever simpered consciously looked foolish George accusation, he said, “Be quiet, Abel, ’ee.” “She good scholar, too!” said Abel, looking admiringly closely written sheet. George could hardly disguise sudden look fury his face, he hastily covered letter his hands manner leave first word page visible. There deeply cunning reason clever manœuvre. George held pretty “cute,” he reckoned that, showing one word time, he could effectually prevent attempt Abel’s part read letter without giving contents George. Like many cunning people, George overreached himself. The first word beyond Abel’s powers, though he might possibly satisfied George’s curiosity one essential point, deciphering name two farther on. But clever George concluded he boasted beyond his ability, he put letter away. Abel tried hard one word George exhibited, gazed silently time puzzled face. “Spell it, mun, spell it!” cried miller’s man, impatiently. It process he seen succeed, long word puzzled his teacher newspaper, now. “M O E R, mower; D Y K, dik,” said Abel. But he looked none wiser effort. “Mower dik! What that?” said George, peering word. “Do’ee think Mower dik, Abel?” “I sure,” said Abel. “Or ’ee think it is ‘_My dear Dick_’?” suggested George, anxiously, sort triumph his tone, quite he expected. “No, no. It Is O, Gearge, second letter. Besides, twould _My dear Gearge_ thee, thou knows.” Again look miller’s man favored Abel far pleasant. But he controlled his voice ordinary drawl (always little slower simple sounding, he specially meant mischief). “So ’twould, Abel. So ’twould. What vool I be, sure! But give I now. We will look another time, Abel.” “I sorry, Gearge,” said Abel, consciousness miller’s man ill-pleased spite his civility. “It long since I school, queer word. Do ’ee think she spelt un wrong, Gearge?” “It Is likely she have,” said George, regaining his composure. “Abel! Abel! Abel!” cried mother dwelling-room. “Come bed, child!” “Good-night, Gearge. I am main sorry stupid, Gearge,” said Abel, he ran. Mrs. Lake walking down, rocking little Jan her arms, wailing fretfully. “I puzzled know ails un,” said Mrs. Lake, answer Abel’s questions. “He quite way to-night. But get thee bed, Abel.” And though Abel begged hard allowed try his powers soothing little Jan, Mrs. Lake insisted upon keeping baby herself; Abel undressed, crept press-bed. He fell asleep spite somewhat disturbed mind. That mysterious word George’s evident displeasure worried him, he troubled also unusual fretfulness little Jan, sound sorrow his baby wail. His last waking thoughts strange mixture, passing stranger dreams. The word Moerdyk danced his eyes, brought meaning it. Jan’s cries troubled him, blended droning ancient plaintive ditty, foster-mother sang she rocked child her arms. That wail baby’s must strange manner recalled first night his arrival, Abel found wailing bed. For fierce eyes strange gentleman haunted Abel’s dreams, face miller’s man. The poor boy dreamed horribly “dropped on” George, fierce black eyes added terrors his uncouth grimaces. He seemed fly blindly vainly mill his tormentor, till George driven his thoughts his coming suddenly upon little Jan, wailing he really wail, round whose head miller-moth sailing slowly, singing human voice:— “The swallow twitters barn, The rook cawing tree, And wood ringdove coos, But false love hath fled me. Like tiny pipe wheaten straw, The wren his little note doth swell, And every living thing flies, Of his true love doth fondly tell. But I alone left pine, And sit beneath withy tree; For truth honesty gone, And false love hath fled me.” CHAPTER VII. ABEL GOES TO SCHOOL AGAIN.—DAME DATCHETT.—A COLUMN OF SPELLING.—ABEL PLAYS MOOCHER.—THE MILLER’S MAN CANNOT MAKE UP HIS MIND. ABEL went school spring, and, though George would better pleased he forgotten whole affair, he remembered word George’s young woman’s love-letter puzzled him; never spelling-lesson set among M’s he hope come across able demand meaning Moerdyk his Dame. Without excuse coming column spelling set herself, Abel dared ask her solve his puzzle; never teacher warmly resent questions she unable answer Dame Datchett. Abel could fully make his mind whether looked among two-syllabled three-syllabled words. He decided former, one day brought his spelling-book George round-house. “I have looking yere word, Gearge,” said he. “There is lots Mo’s, bean’t among  them. Here be. Words two syllables; M, Ma, Me, Mi; be, Mo.” And Abel began rattle familiar column good rate, George looking earnestly his shoulder, following boy’s finger moved rapidly page. “Mocking, Modern, Mohawk, Molar, Molly, Moment, Money, Moping, Moral, Mortal, Moses, Motive, Movement.” “Stop bit, mun,” cried George; “what words mean? They bothers me.” “I knows  them,” said Abel, “and I asked Dame Datchett others, she cross; I thinks  them bothered she too. There is mocking. I knows that. ‘What is modern, Dame?’ says I. ‘A muddle-headed fellow likes you,’ says she. ‘What is mohawk, Dame?’ says I. ‘It is you will come long, ye young hang-gallus,’ says she. I feared her, Gearge, I tell ’ee; I tried luck again. ‘What is molar, Dame?’ says I. ‘It Is wus word t’other,’ says she; ‘and, ’ee axes voolish questions, I will break thee yead ’ee.’ Do ’ee think it is bad word, Gearge?” added Abel, rather indefensible curiosity. “I never heard un,” said George. And perhaps decisive Dame’s statement. “And I do not believe un neither. I think bothered she. I believe it is genteel word man catches oonts. They call oonts _moles_ parts, p’r’aps calls man catches moles molar, calls man drives mill miller.” “It Is likely too, Gearge,” said Abel. “Well! Molly knows. And moment, moping, moral.” “What is moral?” inquired George. “It Is put end Vables, Gearge. There is Vables end spelling-book, I have read un all. There is Wolf Lamb, and”— “I knows now,” said George. “It Is like last verse song Harnet Bittle. Go on, Abel.” “Mortal. That is swearing. Moses. That is Bible, Gearge. Motive. I thought I would try un more. ‘What is motive, Dame?’ says I. ‘I have got un here,’ says she, quite quiet-like. But I seed her feeling ’s chair, I know’d it was strap, I ran straight off, spelling-book all, Gearge.” “So thee’ve playing moocher, eh?” said George, unpleasant twinkle his eyes. “What will Master Lake say that?” “Do not ’ee tell un, Gearge!” Abel implored; “and, O Gearge! let I tell mother word. Maybe she’ve heard tell it. Let I show her letter, Gearge. She will read ’ee. She is scholard, mother.” There mistaking wrath George’s face. The fury fed fear blazes pretty strongly times. “Look ’ee, Abel, boy,” said he, pinching Abel’s shoulder till he turned red white pain. “If thee ever speaks letter word mortal soul, I will tell Master Lake thee plays moocher, I will half kill thee myself. Thee shall rue day ever thee born!” he added, almost beside rage terror. And as, propitiating words, Abel fled mill, George ground his hands together muttered, “Motive! I wish old witch motived every bone thee body, let ’t!” Master George Sannel indeed little irritable stage his career. Like miller, he one stroke good luck, capricious fortune would follow blow. He made five pounds pretty easily. But turn property he become possessed profit was, months waiting, puzzle still. He well aware his want education great hindrance his discovering exact worth he got. And his suspicious nature idea letting one else his secret, even gain help, quite intolerable. Abel seemed nearer even one word George showed him, weeks “schooling,” George progressed slowly learning read he times tempted give effort despair. Of his late outburst Abel he afterwards repented, impolitic, soon good friends his placable teacher. Much time he work George spend “puzzling” his position. Sometimes, upper window mill he saw little Jan Abel’s arms, he would mutter,— “If body kidnap un, would advertise he, I wonders?” consideration would shake his white head doubtfully, saying, “No, wants get rid un, would not brought un here.” Happily poor little Jan, unscrupulous rustic rejected next idea came doubtful success. “I wonder they would come something handsome could tell  them young varmint hands good all. ’Twould save un ten shilling week. Ten shilling week! I heard un ears. I would kep’ un five, they would asked me. I wonders now. Little uns like get stole gipsies sometimes. Varmer Smith’s son were, never heard again. They falls mill-race sometimes. They venturesome. But I doubt ’twouldn’t do. Them belongs might glad enough get rid un, save credit money turning upon I all.” The miller’s man puzzled vain. He could think mode action safe certain success. He even know whether he possessed value, make use it. But sort dim hope seeing his way yet kept mill, he persevered effort learn read, kept his big ears open thing might drop miller his wife throw light history Jan, his hopes bound up. Meanwhile, dogged patience, he bided his time. CHAPTER VIII. VISITORS AT THE MILL.—A WINDMILLER OF THE THIRD GENERATION.—CURE FOR WHOOPING-COUGH.—MISS AMABEL ADELINE AMMABY.—DOCTORS DISAGREE. ONE earliest Jan’s remembrances—of remembrances, I mean, remained childhood past—was little Miss Amabel, Grange, held hopper windmill whooping cough. Jan three four years old time, idol his foster-mother, great favorite his adopted brothers sisters. A quaint little fellow he was, broad, intellectual-looking face, serious old-fashionedness, fair, eyes “like slans.” He standing one morning Mrs. Lake’s apron-string, his arms clasped lovingly, somewhat tightly, round waist sandy kitten, submitted wonderful good-humor well-meant strangulation, his black eyes intently fixed upon dumplings his foster-mother dexterously rolling together, strange footstep heard shuffling uncertainly floor round-house outside dwelling-room door. Mrs. Lake disturb herself. Country folk constantly coming bags grist, George miller hand, nice breeze blowing, mill ground merrily. After seconds, however, came modest knock room-door, Mrs. Lake, wiping her hands, proceeded admit knocker. She smartly dressed woman, bore mass laces finery, white woollen shawl spread it, apparently purpose smothering living thing might chance beneath, as, Mrs. Lake’s experienced eyes, could nothing less baby genteel order. The manners nurse genteel also, might quite overpowered Mrs. Lake, windmiller’s wife her youth good service herself, and, though early marriage prevented her rising beyond post nursemaid, she fairly familiar etiquette nursery servants’ hall. “Good morning, madam,” said nurse, sooner ceased walk she began kind diagonal movement without progression, one heel clacked, her petticoats swung, baby who, head downwards, snorting gaping mouth woollen coverlet, supposed soothed. “Good morning, madam. You will excuse intruding”— “Not all, mum,” said Mrs. Lake. By she mean reject excuse, disclaim intrusion. When nurse speaking, she kept time her rocking peculiar click her tongue roof her mouth; indeed sometimes mingled, almost confusingly, her conversation. “You are obliging, madam, I am sure,” said she, and, persuaded Mrs. Lake, she took seat. “You will excuse asking singular question, madam, _was husband’s father grandfather millers_?” “They was, mum,” said Mrs. Lake. “My husband’s father’s father built mill stands. It cost deal money, he died debt upon it. My husband’s father paid un off; he meant built house, mum, he never did, worse luck us. He allus says, says he,—that is husband’s father, mum,—’I will leave Abel,’—that is maester, mum. But nine year ago come Michaelmas”— Mrs. Lake’s story interrupted frightful outburst coughing unfortunate baby, removal woollen shawl presented appearance would comical sympathy condition demanded. A red utterly shapeless little face lay, like crushed beet-root, mass dainty laces almost voluminous enough dressed bride. As sort crowning satire, face particular surrounded broad frill, spotted bunches pink satin ribbon, farther encased white satin hood elaborate workmanship fringes. [Picture: A red utterly shapeless little face lay, like crushed beet-root, mass dainty laces almost voluminous enough dressed bride] The contrast natural red baby’s complexion snowy finery ludicrously suggestive over-dressed nigger, begin with; when, paroxysms cough, tiny creature’s face passed shades plum-color bluish black, result appalling behold. Mrs. Lake’s experienced ears slow discover child got whooping-cough, nurse confessed case. She also apologized bringing baby among Mrs. Lake’s children, saying she “thought nothing poor little chirrub herself.” “Do not name it, mum,” replied windmiller’s wife. “I always say children things, they will  them; not, will not.” A theory seems sum views majority people Mrs. Lake’s class life upon spread disease. “I am sure I do not know what is coming poor head,” nurse continued: “I have much told I am, madam. I am nurse Grange, madam, Mr. Ammaby Lady Louisa. They have town, her ladyship’s best advice, we have come country three months, dear child do not seem bit better. And we have trying every thing, I am sure. For thing I heard I have tried, well doctor ordered, rubbing stuff Lady Louisa’s mamma insisted upon, too,—even frog put dear child’s mouth, drawed back legs, that is supposed certain cure, frightened fit I thought never would come of, well fetching her ladyship way her boudoir know matter—which I dared tell her fly.” “Dear, dear!” said miller’s wife; “have tried goose-grease, mum? It Is excellent thing.” “Goose-grease, madam, excellent ointment bone-setter’s toll-bar, butler paid his pocket, knowing done world good his sister bad leg, besides certain cure coughs, cancer, consumption well. And doctor’s _imprecation_ little chest, night morning, besides; nothing do not seem good,” said poor nurse. “And so, madam,—her ladyship gone town,—thinks I, I will take dear child windmill. For say,—where I came from, madam,—that miller, that is son miller, grandson miller, holds child that is got whooping-cough hopper mill whilst mill’s going, cures them, however bad be.” The reason nurse’s visit made known, Mrs. Lake called her husband, explained he asked “her ladyship’s baby.” The miller scratched his head. “I have heard father say his brother drove mill Cheshire do,” said he, “but I never myself, madam, ever see un done. And hopper ackerd place, madam. We have ground many cat mill, getting hopper nights warmth. However,” he added, “I suppose I hold little lady pretty tight.” And finally, though unwillingness, miller consented try charm; chiefly influenced wish disoblige gentlefolk Grange. The little Jan watched proceedings visitors great attention. During poor baby’s fit coughing, he absorbed sandy kitten slipped his arms made off, her tail stiff sentry’s musket; miller took baby his arms, Jan became excited, asked, “What daddy un?” “The old-fashioned little piece!” exclaimed nurse, admiringly. And Mrs. Lake added, “Let un see little lady, maester.” The miller held baby, nurse, removing dainty handkerchief edged Valenciennes lace face, introduced “Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby;” Mrs. Lake murmured, “What lovely little thing!” By which, truth’s sake, hoped she meant lace-edged handkerchief. In exchange civilities two women, respective children charge admonished kiss other,—a feat accomplished Jan’s kissing baby tenderly, his usual gravity. As partly awoke baby doze, red face began crease, pucker, twist various contortions, Jan gazed sort solemn curiosity his black eyes. “Stroke little lady’s cheeks, love,” said Mrs. Lake, irrepressibly proud winning ways quaint grace certainly distinguish her foster-child. Jan leaned forward more, passed his little hand softly baby’s face twice thrice, he will not stroke sandy kitten, slept him, saying, “Poor itta pussy!” “It is puss-cat, bless his little heart!” said matter-of-fact nurse. “It is little Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby.” “Say it, love!” said Mrs. Lake, adding, nurse, “he say thing, mum.” “Miss _Am—abel Ad—e—line Am—ma—by_,” prompted nurse. “Amabel!” said little Jan, softly. But, feat, he took fit childish reticence, would say more; whilst, deeply resentful liberties Jan taken, Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby twisted her features till she looked like gutta-percha gargoyle, squalled fretful baby squall. She calmed last, however, windmiller took her his arms, Mrs. Lake carrying Jan, climbed narrow ladder next floor. Heavily ground huge stones hundred twenty revolutions minute, making chamber shake went round. They made nurse giddy. The simplest machinery bewildering effect upon unaccustomed person. So going ladder; makes feel much less safe place leads got proper flight stairs. So—very often—has finding face face accomplishment striving for, happen weak-minded. Under combined influences causes, nurse listened nervously Master Lake, he honors mill. “Those mill-stones, madam. Pretty fastish grinds, goes faster wind’s gusty. Many good cat they have ground flat pancake poor gawney beasts getting hopper.” “Oh, sir!” cried nurse, thoroughly alarmed, “give young lady back again. Deary, deary me! I would notion dangerous. Oh, do not, sir! do not!” “Tut, tut! I will hold un safe, madam,” said windmiller, man’s dislike shirking last moment decided upon; and, nurse afterwards expressed it, she time scream, he tucked Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby’s finery well round her, dipped her hopper again. In moment suspense women silent, little Jan gazed steadily operation. As safely ended, broke simultaneously words. “You might knocked feather, mum!” gasped Mrs. Lake. “I could not look, mum. I could not looked save life. I turned back.” “I would back ’ee allus silliest thing could done, missus,” said miller, pleasant husbandly way commenting upon his wife’s conversation her disparagement, she talked him. “As me, madam,” nurse said, “I could not take eyes dear child’s hood. But move,—no thank you, madam,—I could not moved hand foot five-pound note, paid upon spot.” The baby got well. Whether mill charm worked cure, whether fine fresh breezes healthy district made change better child’s state, could proved. Nor possible causes recovery. The kind-hearted butler blessed day he laid three eightpence box bone-setter’s ointment, good purpose. Lady Louisa’s mamma triumphantly hoped would lesson her dear daughter never set London doctor’s advice (however expensive) mother’s (she meant grandmother’s) experience. The cook said, “Goose-grease kitchen physic her!” And course doctor properly, well modestly, observed “he confidently anticipated permanent beneficial results persevering use embrocation.” And nurse windmiller’s family known Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby dipped mill-hopper. CHAPTER IX. GENTRY BORN.—LEARNING LOST.—JAN’S BEDFELLOW.—AMABEL. AFTER nurse baby left mill, Mrs. Lake showered extra caresses upon little January It given her strange pleasure see contact Squire’s child. She knew enough manners customs, looks intelligence children educated parents, aware “makings” born heirs developed intellects, grace comes discipline, different “makings” found “voolish” descendants ill-nurtured uneducated generations. She philosophical—hardly reasonable commendable—thoughts it. But she felt Jan’s countenance his “ways” justified her first belief he “gentry born.” She proud his pretty manners. Indeed, curiously enough, she recalled her old memories nursery etiquette first-rate upper nurse “her young days,” apply little Jan’s training. Why she done her children question cannot perhaps solved till know many soldiers, used for, may be, quarter century personal cleanliness scrupulous gentleman’s, enforced neatness clothes, rooms, general habits, take back dirt slovenliness greediness leave service; many nurse, whose voice manners beyond reproach her mistress’s nursery, brings her children life village system bawling, banging, threatening, cuddling, stuffing, smacking, coarse language, she never experienced better discipline attainable gentle firmness regular habits. Mrs. Lake small satisfaction Jan’s brief limited intercourse genteel baby, she amused herself making repeat baby’s genteel (and she justly said “uncommon”) name. When Abel came back school, he resumed his charge, Mrs. Lake went work. She busy, nurse-boy put Jan bed himself. The sandy kitten waited till Jan fairly established, receive her comfortably, she dropped roof press-bed, he cuddled her his arms, she purred like kettle beginning sing. Outside, wind rising, and, passing less outer door, roared round-house; well sheltered dwelling-room, could listen complacently gusts whirled sails, made heavy stones fly round till shook roof. Just press-bed candle stuck wall, dim light falling gloom upon children made scene worthy pencil Rembrandt, great son windmiller. When Mrs. Lake found time come corner old press-bed stood, kitten asleep, Jan nearly so; sat Abel, watching every breath his foster-brother drew. And, he watched, his trustworthy eyes sweet smile lighting face his forefathers bequeathed little beauty intellect, he might guardian angel nameless Jan, scarcely veiled likeness child. His mother smiled tenderly back upon him. He dear her, less his tenderness January Then she stooped kiss her foster-child, opened his black eyes wide, caught sleeping kitten round head, fear might taken him. “Tell Abel name pretty young lady see to-day, love,” said Mrs. Lake. But Jan well aware his power miller’s wife, apt indulge caprice. So he shook his head, cuddled kitten tightly before. “Tell un, Janny dear. Tell un, there is lovey!” said Mrs. Lake. “Who daddy put hopper?” But still Jan gazed nothing particular sly twinkle his black eyes, continued squeeze poor Sandy degree little less agonizing millstone torture; obdurate he would probably remained, Abel, bending him, said, “Do ’ee tell poor Abel, January” The child fixed his bright eyes steadily Abel’s well-loved face seconds, said quite clearly, soft, evenly accented syllables,— “Amabel.” And sandy kitten, escaped life, crept back Jan’s bosom purred rest. CHAPTER X. ABEL AT HOME.—JAN OBJECTS TO THE MILLER’S MAN.—THE ALPHABET.—THE CHEAP JACK.—“PITCHERS.” POOR Abel fated get much regular schooling. He particularly liked learning, interval brief time his mother able spare housework time his father began employ mill. George got lazy stupid, instead less so, though strange manner he kept his place, yet Master Lake begun employ his son, he found he would get along ill without him. To Jan, Abel’s windmill gave utmost satisfaction. He played his younger foster-brothers sisters contentedly enough, his love Abel, Abel, quite another thing. Mrs. Lake, too, confidence one Abel nurse her darling; consequence was, little Jan constantly trotting his foster-brother’s heels round-house, attempting valiant escalades ladders, covering head foot flour effort cultivate miller’s thumb. One day Mrs. Lake, sent children school, bent upon thorough cleaning-out dwelling-room, process Jan likely her way; she caught her arms went seek Abel round-house. She less scruple availing herself his services, wind, business brisk windmill. “Maester!” she cried, “can Abel mind Jan bit? I going clean house.” “Ay, ay,” said windmiller, “Abel mind un. I going village myself, there is Gearge start, wind rises. And he want Abel, thee must take little un again.” “Sartinly I will,” said his wife; Abel willingly received his charge carried play among sacks. George joined once, Jan rooted unconquerable dislike miller’s man, never replied his advances thing friendly anger tears. This day exception others respect; fruitless attempts make acceptable, course he trod sandy kitten’s tail, ran Jan’s back spat her enemy vantage-ground, George went muttering terms means complimentary little January Abel his best excuse capricious child George, besides chiding his rudeness—with little effect. Jan dried his black eyes miller’s man made off, he looked ashamed good dog looks growled refused paw friendship one excellent reasons his own. After George gone, played happily enough, Jan riding Abel’s back, sandy kitten Jan’s, among corn-sacks, full canter far old carved meal-chest, back door again. Poor Abel, his double burden, got tired last, sat sifted flour education thumbs. Jan pinching flattening his solemn face, hope attaining miller’s thumb shorter process common one, Abel suddenly said,— “I tell thee what, then, Jan: it is time thee learned thy letters. And I will teach thee. Come hither.” Jan jumped up, thereby pitching kitten headlong his shoulders, ran Abel, squatting spilled flour near sack, smoothing upon floor his hands. Then slowly carefully he traced letter A flour, keenly watched January “That is A,” said he. “Say it, January A.” “A,” replied Jan, obediently. But he sooner said it, than, adding hastily, “Let Jan it,” he traced second A, slightly larger Abel’s, three firm perfectly proportioned strokes. His moving finger much kitten’s feelings, she sprang flour pawed A’s existence. Jan slapped her vigorously, smoothed surface more, he drew A A greatest rapidity, scrambling along sideways like crab, using hands indifferently, till row stretched far flour would permit. Abel’s pride his pupil great, he fain run call his mother see performances prodigy, Jan impatient spare him. “Let Jan more!” he cried. Abel traced B flour. “That is B, Jan,” said he. “Jan it,” replied Jan, confidently. “But say it,” said his teacher, restraining him. “Say B, January” “B,” said Jan, impatiently; adding, “Jan it,” he began row B’s. He hesitated slightly making second curve, looked his model, he went line before, quite successfully. And kitten went also, pawing letter made, impression whole affair game play herself. “There bean’t letter bothers him,” cried Abel, triumphantly, less triumphant foster-mother. Jan had, indeed, gone whole alphabet, utmost ease self-confidence; his remembrance names letters he drew readily proved far less perfect his representations floor round-house. Abel found his pupil’s progress hindered talent he displayed. He anxious draw letters he would learn them, Abel last obliged make one thing condition other. “Say then, Jan,” he would cry, “and thee shall make  them.” Mrs. Lake commissioned Abel buy small slate pencil Jan village shop, child’s favorite toys. He would sit quiet length time them. Even sandy kitten neglected, got rap nose slate-pencil, toy moving point great temptation resisted. For Jan’s taste wielding pencil solely devoted furthering his learning read. He drew letters till day Cheap Jack called. The Cheap Jack travelling pedler, good deal business neighborhood. He pedler pure, he little shop next town. Nature favored him. He hunchback. He was, pretended be, deaf. He ugly face, made uglier dirt, he wore mangy hair cap. He sold rough pottery, cheap crockery glass, mock jewelry, low song-books, framed pictures, mirrors, quack medicines. He bought old bottles, bones, rags. And else he bought sold, dealt with, dimly guessed few, fully known none. Where he born, his true name age, whether given occasion he speaking less lies, ultimate object his words deeds,—at things one even guessed. That his conscience ever clean, his dirty face masked vile petty plots evil brain behind, past period he child,—these things would tasked strongest faith realize. He unpopular children miller’s man. The instinct children like instinct dogs, true delicate rule. But dogs, Cerberus downwards, liable biassed sops. And four paper-covered sails, twirl upon end stick wind blows, would warp better judgment little boys, especially (for bargain precious gift) thing bought old bones. Jan little afraid Cheap Jack, he liked his whirligigs. They went mill going, sometimes mill would not go, ran hard make breeze. But happened first day Cheap Jack came round Jan begun learn his letters, he brought forth wares moved Jan’s feelings whirligigs did. “Buy nice picter, marm?” said Cheap Jack Mrs. Lake, who, best intentions purchase, felt could harm seeing man got. “You shall ‘Joseph his Bretheren’ cheap,” roared hunchback, becoming pressing windmiller’s wife seemed slow fascinated, shaking “Joseph his Brethren,” framed satin-wood, her face, he advanced upon her almost threatening air. “Do not want  them? Take ‘Antony Cleopatterer.’ It is sweet picter. Too dear? Do know sech picters costs paint? Look Cleopatterer’s dress jewels she on. I do not make farthing  them. I gets daily bread things, keeps picters oblige one two ladies taste likes give rooms genteel appearance.” The long disuse powers judgment she had, long habit always giving way, helped convert Mrs. Lake’s naturally weak unselfish disposition sort mental pulp, plastic pressure without. To men she invariably yielded; and, poor specimen man Cheap Jack was, she fibre personal judgment decision strength oppose his assertions, every instant she became convinced wares she neither wanted approved necessary her, good bargains, man sold said so. The Cheap Jack knave, he fool. In crowded market-place, street door, oilier tongue wagged his. But he knew exactly moment doubtful bargain might clinched bullying tone fierce look his dirty face, cottage doors, heaths downs, good wife alone her children, nearest neighbor half mile away. No length experience taught Mrs. Lake wisdom reference Cheap Jack. Each time his cart appeared sight she resolved nothing him, warned latest cracked jug, sugar-basin which, three-quarters hour wasted chaffering, she beaten three-halfpence dearer she afterwards found shop price town. But proof untrained mind “as water spilled upon ground.” And Cheap Jack declared she quite free look without buying, he want her buy, Mrs. Lake allowed pull his goods before, listened his statements she never proved lies, thrown confusion fluster he began bully, bought haste rid him, repented leisure—to purpose far future concerned. “Look here!” yelled hunchback, he waddled horrible swiftness miller’s wife, she withdrew mill; “which mean have? _I_ gets nothing  them, whichever takes, please yourself. Take ‘Joseph his Bretheren.’ The frame’s worth twice money. Take other, too, I will take sixpence pair, pocket please you.” “Nothing to-day, thank you!” said Mrs. Lake, loudly she could. “Got sort, say?” said Cheap Jack. “I have got sorts, parties difficult please. “Wait bit, wait bit,” he continued, Mrs. Lake tried make (willing to) hear she wanted none his wares; and, vanishing uncanny quickness common him, he waddled swiftly back his cart, returned, Mrs. Lake could secure herself intrusion, laden fresh supply pictures, weight seemed marvellous he could support. “Now you have got choice, marm,” he said. “It is trouble oblige good customer. There is picters you!” “_Pitchers_!” said Jan, admiringly, he crept them. “So are, little man. Now then, help mammy choose. Most things cannot get now, love money. Here are,—‘Love Beauty.’ That is sweet thing. ‘St Joseph,’ ‘The Robber’s Bride,’ ‘Child Lamb,’ ‘Melan-choly.’ Here is old”— “Pitcher!” exclaimed Jan more, gazing old etching dirty frame, Cheap Jack holding his hand. “Pitcher, pitcher! let Jan look!” he cried. It water-mill, old, thatched, unprotected wheel, like one valley below. Some gnarled willows stretched across water, whose trunks seemed hardly less time-worn rotten wheel below. This foreground subject shadow, strongly drawn, beyond it, sunlight, lay bit delicate distance, rising ground stood one small wooden windmills known Post-mills. An old woman child coming shade, passing beneath wayside shrine. What picture took Jan’s fancy impossible say, he gazed exclamations delight. The Cheap Jack saw certain bought, he raised price accordingly. Mrs. Lake felt conviction, began try least get good bargain. “It Is terr’ble old frame,” said she. “There gold left on’t.” And was. “What say?” screamed Cheap Jack, his hand his ear, great deal close Mrs. Lake’s face pleasant. “It Is old frame,” she shouted, “and gold gone.” “Old!” cried hunchback, scowling; “who says I sell old things? Every picter lot’s brand new dirt cheap.” “The gold rubbed off,” screamed Mrs. Lake his ear. “Brighten up, then,” said Cheap Jack. “Gold are not paint; gold are not paper; rub up!” and, suiting action word, he rubbed dirty old frame vigorously dirty sleeve his smock. “It do not seem brighten it, nohow,” said Mrs. Lake, looking nervously round; neither miller George seen. “Real gold allus looks like damp weather,” said Cheap Jack. “Hang warm room, dust lightly every morning dry handkerchief, an’ it will come shining you will see face it. And summer comes, cover yaller gauze keep flies.” Mrs. Lake looked wistfully place Cheap Jack rubbed, she redress, saw way her hobble buy picture. When bargain completed, Cheap Jack fell back his oiliest manner; part his system bully critical moment, civil afterwards, leave impression pleasant minds his lady customers could hardly thank his promise call shortly “bargains good ever.” The Cheap Jack man many voices. The softness his parting words Mrs. Lake, “I would go three mile road, madam, call lady like you,” hardly died away, he woke echoes plains addressing his horse different tone. The Wiltshire carters horses language falls darkly upon ear unlearned therein; uncouth yell Cheap Jack addressed his beast dialect. The sound he made occasion not, Ga oot! Coom hedder! or, There right! horse understood it. It probable never heard Cheap Jack’s softer intonations, protuberant bones gave quiver beneath scarred skin he yelled. Then drooping ears pricked faintly, quavering forelegs braced, one desperate jog tottering load oddities, set slowly silently forward. The Cheap Jack follow his wares; he scrambled softly round mill, like deformed cat, looking sides. Then he made use another sound,—a sharp, suggestive sound, whistled two his fingers. Then he looked round again. No one appeared. The wheels distant cart scraped slowly along road, sound Cheap Jack heard. He whistled softly again. And cart took sharp turn road, lost sight, miller’s man appeared, Cheap Jack greeted softest tone he yet employed. “Ah, are, dear!” * * * * * Meanwhile, Mrs. Lake sat within, looked ruefully damaged frame, wished master, least man, happened home. It feared self-reproach done wrong always certain, keen, self-reproach allowed suffer wrong—in bad bargain. Whether particular picture bad bargain easy decide. It scandalously dear condition, cost hunchback, cheap pleasure gave little January CHAPTER XI. SCARECROWS AND MEN.—JAN REFUSES TO “MAKE GEARGE.”—UNCANNY.—“JAN’S OFF.”-THE MOON AND THE CLOUDS. THE picture gave Jan great pleasure, proved stumbling-block road learning. To “make letters” his slate utmost his ambition, he made he learned them. But Cheap Jack’s visit his constant cry was, “Jan make pitchers.” And Abel tried confine his attention alphabet, he would, perfunctory repetition letters he knew, hap-hazard blunders fresh ones, fling his arms round Abel’s neck say coaxingly, “Abel dear, make Janny _pitchers_ his slate.” Abel’s pictures, best, style wall decoration dear street boys. “Make pitcher man,” Jan would cry. And Abel so, bit bit, Jan’s dictation. Thus “Make’s head. Make un round. Make two eyes. Make nose. Make mouth. Make’s arms. Make’s fingers,” etc. And, “free-handling,” Abel would strike five fingers off, one one, five screeching strokes slate-pencil. But his art conventional, Jan said, “Make un miller’s thumb,” he puzzled, could bend shortest five strokes slightly backwards represent trade-mark his forefathers. And little later Jan said one day, “It Is galley crow, is. _Now_ make pitcher MAN, Abel dear!” Abel found scarecrow figure limit his artist powers, thenceforward Jan “made pitchers.” He drew dawn dusk upon little slate he wore tied bit string belt his pinafore. He drew his foster-mother, Abel, kitten, clock, flower-pots window, windmill itself, every thing he saw imagined. And he drew till his slate full sides, primitive fashion he spat rubbed began again. And whenever Jan’s face washed, two faces his slate washed too; companion he perfectly happy constantly employed. Now Abel gave subjects pictures, Jan made them, good Abel also washed slate, rubbed well-worn stumps pencil new points upon round-house floor. They often went together mound little distance, where, seated side side, “made mill” upon slate, Jan drawing, Abel dictating details recorded. “Put window, Jan,” he would say; “and another, another, another, another. Now put sails. Now put stage. Now put daddy door.” On one point Jan obstinate. He steadily refused “make Gearge” upon his slate capacity whatever. Perhaps habit constantly gazing things him, order commit his slate, gave strange, dreamy expression Jan’s dark eyes. Perhaps sky-gazing, windmiller’s trick watching clouds, perhaps something else, Jan derived erectness carriage common among children him, quaint way carrying his little chin air he listening voices higher level round-house floor. If he lived farther north, he could hardly escaped suspicion uncanniness. He strangely like changeling among miller’s children. To gratify old whim his red shawl, his doting foster-mother made little crimson frocks; he wandered downs his red dress white pinafore, his yellow hair flying breeze, his chin up, his black eyes wide open, slate one hand, his pencil other, sandy kitten clinging his shoulder (for Jan never lowered his chin help her balance herself), he looked like elf child man. He queer, independent ways his own, too; freaks,—not naughty enough severe punishment, sufficiently routine unexpected Mrs. Lake trouble. He sooner firmly established his legs, power walking, rather toddling, independent help, he took making expeditions downs himself. He would watch his opportunity, his foster-mother’s back turned, door round-house opened grist-bringer, he would slip toddle swiftness decidedly dangerous balance lately acquired. Sometimes Mrs. Lake would catch sight him, her hands wash-tub, otherwise engaged, she would cry nurse-boy, “Abel, he off! Jan’s off.” A comic result Jan generally announced his departure words, though always loud enough bring detection upon himself. When his chance came door open, he would pause half moment threshold say, tone intense self-satisfaction, “He off. Abel! Janny’s off!” forthwith toddle hard he could go. As he grew older, he dropped form; elfish habit appearing disappearing his whim cured. It puzzle well care Mrs. Lake. All her children given trouble way,—a way much them. They squalled wanted, and, like mothers her class, she served whilst her patience lasted, slapped came end. They clung her she cooking, company cats, she put tit-bits dirty paws, threw scraps clean paws cats, till nuisance became overwhelming, she kicked cats slapped children, squalled both. They dirted clothes, squabbled, tore gathers her dresses, wailed wept, beaten hazel-stick father, pacified treacle-stick mother; tumbled up, one other, childish customs misdemeanors, almost uniform steps mill-ladders. But customs misdemeanors foster-child different. His appetite constantly eating, drinking, sucking—if bennet grass-stalk—was less voracious children. Mrs. Lake gave Benjamin’s share treacle-stick, he known give away, exchange peppermint-drops slate-pencil rather softer his own. He would Benjamin’s share “bits” cupboard, children begged much oftener, Mrs. Lake capable refusing thing steady tease. He could walk whole length turnip-field without taking munch, unless he hungry, though even dear old Abel invariably exercised his jaws upon “turmut.” And he made ill hedge-fruits ground-roots seldomer member family. So far, Jan gave less trouble rest. But he spirit enterprise never misled them. From effects this, Abel saved his life once. On one occasion he pulled wash-tub, he plunged head-foremost, futile endeavor blow soap-bubbles fragment clay-pipe, he picked road, made his lips sore week, besides nearly causing his death drowning. From diving deepest recesses windmill became hopeless try hinder him, Abel fairly taken business Mrs. Lake relied upon his care his foster-brother. And Jan wary nimble, his part, gave little trouble. His great delight gaze first one window, opposite one; either blinking great sails drove by, would strike face, watching shadows invisible, passed like noon-day ghosts grass. His habit taking solitary expeditions neither miller’s hazel-stick Mrs. Lake’s treacle-stick could cure force favor. One November evening, tea, Jan disappeared, yellow kitten also. When his bed-time came, Mrs. Lake sought high low, Abel went carefully, mill-candlestick hand, every floor, millstones machinery, vain. Neither he kitten found. It kitten, chase her tail, tumbled sideways round-house door, Mrs. Lake remembered Jan might possibly gone out, she ran him. The air chill fresh, bitterly cold. The moon rode high dark heavens, flock small white clouds passed slowly face spread sky. The shadows driving sails fell clearly moonlight, flitted grass quickly clouds went moon. Mrs. Lake susceptible effects scenery, she thinking January As she ran round windmill, she struck her foot proved his body, and, stooping, saw he lying his face. But she snatched cry terror, she found he dead, even hurt, weeping pettishly. In first revulsion feeling her fright, she rather disposed shake her recovered treasure, relief her excitement. But Abel, whose first sight Jan light mill-candle fell his tear-stained face, said tenderly, “What amiss, Janny?” “Jan cannot make un,” sobbed his foster-brother. “What cannot Janny make? Tell Abel, then,” said nurse-boy. Jan stuck his fists his eyes, drying fast, replied, “Jan cannot make moon clouds, Abel dear!” And Abel’s candle moment blown gust wind, he could see Jan’s slate pencil lying distance apart upon short grass. On dark ground slate he made round, white, full moon his soft slate-pencil, tried hard draw cloud passed. But rapid changes baffled him, pencil-marks gray compared whiteness clouds brightness moon, slate, though dark, mockery deep, deep depths night-sky. And his despair he flung slate one way pencil another, lay moonlight; sandy kitten, could see clearly occasion one else, dancing fandango upon poor Jan’s unfinished sketch. CHAPTER XII. THE WHITE HORSE.—COMROGUES.—MOERDYK.—GEORGE CONFIDES IN THE CHEAP JACK—WITH RESERVATION. WHEN Cheap Jack’s horse came brow hill, stopped, drooping neck stood still before. The Cheap Jack busy George, word poor beast paused. It knew point wait, waited. There little temptation go on. The road hill mended flints; size average turnip, hill steep. So old horse poked his nose, stood almost dozing, till sound Cheap Jack’s shuffling footsteps caused prick his ears, brace his muscles fresh start. The miller’s man came also, sulky, whilst Cheap Jack civil. He gave his horse cut across knees, remind plant his feet carefully among sharp boulders; then, choosing smooth bit side road, he George went forward together. “You have took picters, I see,” said George, nodding towards cart. “So I have, dear,” said Cheap Jack; “any thing livelihood; _honest_ livelihood, know, George.” And he winked miller’s man, relaxed his sulkiness guffaw. “_You’ve_ little way lately, George,” hunchback continued, looking sharply sideways his companion. “Sly business slack, dear, eh?” But George made answer, Cheap Jack, relieving his feelings another cut horse, changed subject. “That is sharp little brat miller’s,” said he, alluding January “And he are not much like others. Old-fashioned, too. Children mostly likes gay picters, worrits mothers  them, bless  them! But he picked ancient-looking thing,—came bankrupt pawnshop, dear, lot. I almost think I let go cheap; that is failing. And beggarly place like are not like London. In London there is place every thing, dear, shops old goods well new, customers too; older dirtier things is, fetches.” There pause, George speak; Cheap Jack, bent upon amiability, repeated his remark,—“A sharp little brat, too!” “What ’ee harping for?” asked George, suspiciously. “I knows I knows un, that is business yours.” “You know things, dear,” said Cheap Jack, flatteringly. “They will get early catch napping. But child, George?” “Never mind,” said George. “But he are not none miller’s, I will tell ’ee that; he are not missus’s neither.” “What he _you_, dear?” asked dwarf, curiously, and, getting answer, he went on: “He would useful good many lines. He would bad circus, he would draw prime young prodigy.” George looked round, “You thinking stealing _he_ then, well as”— “Hush, dear,” said dwarf. “No, no, I do not want him. But good deal snatching young kids done young days; sweeps, destitute orphans, juvenile performers, on.” “_He_ would not suit you,” grinned George. “A comes genteel folk, a’s hard enough you would treat un.” “You are there, George,” said dwarf. “Human beings like ’osses; it is genteelest stands most. ’Specially they have well fed babies.” At point Cheap Jack interrupted his horse stumbling huge, jagged lump flint, that, rest road-mending, disgrace highway civilized country. A rate-payer horse-keeper might excused losing his temper authorities road-mending department; Cheap Jack’s wrath fell upon his horse. He beat knees stumbling, across hind legs slipping, his face wincing, accompanied his blows torrent abuse. What moment must Balaam’s ass, she found voice remonstrate unjust blows, have, nevertheless, fallen pretty thickly ever since upon her descendants fellow-servants ungrateful man! From many patient eyes old reproach, long service ill-requited, yet speaks almost plainly voice “rebuked madness prophet!” The Cheap Jack’s white horse point resemblance “genteel human beings” he speaking. It “come good stock,” seen better kinder days; it, also, misfortunes, remained nobility spirit rises proportion ills meets with. The poor old thing miserably weak, sore jaded, flints torture. But rallied forces, gave desperate struggle, got cart safely bottom hill. Here road turned sharply, horse went on. But paces stopped before; time front small public-house, trembling, bathed perspiration, waited master. The public-house small dark, dingy-looking hovel, reputation fitted appearance. A dirty, grim-looking man nodded Cheap Jack George entered, girl equally dirty, much handsomer, brought glasses spirits, friends applied themselves, Cheap Jack’s expense. George grew sociable, Cheap Jack reproached want confidence his friends. “You are precious sharp, dear,” said hunchback, knew well point George liked flattered, “that overreaches yourself. I do not complain—after business we have done together—that it is turned slack sudden. You says they are you, that is enough me. I do not complain you have got plans keeps  them secret grave, I says you will regret it. If good scholar, George, could without friends, you are precious sharp. But you are scholar, dear, you will let yet, worse friend Cheap John.” George bitterly regretted his want common learning, stupidity made still slow decipher print, utterly puzzled writing, Cheap Jack’s remarks told strongly. These, conversation hill, recalled his mind matter still mystery miller’s man. “Look here, Jack,” said he, leaning across dirty little table; “if good scholar, M O E R D Y K spell?” “Say again, George,” said dwarf. But when, that, he still looked puzzled, George laughed long loudly. “You good scholar!” he cried. “You fine friend, too, iggerant man. If cannot tell first word letter, it is likely ’ee could read whole, too!” “The first word _letter_, eh?” said dwarf. “The first,” said George. “It Is long way you would get it, stuck start!” “Up corner, top, eh?” said dwarf. “So be,” said George, he laughed longer. “It is name place, then,” said Cheap Jack; “and are not expected I know names places world, George, dear.” It great triumph Cheap Jack, George’s face betrayed. If George trusted little more, he might known meaning mysterious word years ago. The name place! The place letter written. The place something might learned writer letter, gentleman written. For George knew much. It written gentleman, gentleman money, secrets; and, therefore, gentleman money might got, interfering his secrets. The miller’s man ignorant stupid, spite certain low cunning incompatible gross ignorance. He knowledge world. His knowledge malpractices mischief confined evil doings one two ill-conditioned country lads like himself, robbed neighbors dark nights, disposed spoil help men Cheap Jack landlord public-house bottom hill. But loitering stormy night years ago, he attending mill, he picked enough show strange gentleman mind his proceedings little Jan generally known. This sort traditional idea “sharp,” though penniless men times wrung great deal money rich people, threatening betray secrets, sole foundation George’s hopes connection letter. It his ignorance hindered seeing innumerable chances his getting know thing important enough, even he could use his information, procure bribe. He long given idea hopeless, though he kept letter, revived Cheap Jack solved puzzle Abel could explain, George finally promised let his friend read whole letter him. He also allowed concerned Jan, he supposed so. He related Jan’s history, confessed he picked letter, blown near mill, night Jan’s arrival. In statement truth, falsehood; opinion miller’s man, interest obliged confide friend, least wise hedge confidence telling truth, qualifying lies. This mental process was, however, least equally familiar Cheap Jack, he hesitate, his mind, feel sure letter found, stolen. In he farther truth he simply believed George. But he neighborhood five years back, and, happened, he never heard lost pocket-book. CHAPTER XIII. GEORGE AS A MONEYED MAN.—SAL.—THE “WHITE HORSE.”—THE WEDDING.—THE WINDMILLER’S WIFE FORGETS, AND REMEMBERS TOO LATE. EXCITEMENT, stifling atmosphere public-house, spirits he drunk his friend’s expense, somewhat confused brains miller’s man time Cheap Jack rose go. George was, rule, sober beyond will not rustics district, chiefly parsimony. When he could drink another man’s expense, he always prudent. “So you have settled go, dear?” said dwarf, stood together cart. “Business slack, parties unpleasantly suspicious, eh?” “Never mind,” said George, felt foolish, hoped successful looking wise; “I going set myself; I am tired slaving another man.” “Quite right, too,” said dwarf; “but businesses takes money, which, dear, I does not doubt you have plenty. You always took care Number One, business Cheap John.” At moment, George felt sort embodiment shrewd wisdom; he taken another sip glass, still his hand, drawback sense magnified cunning his ideas seemed illumined less pleasant feeling perpetually slipping his grasp. To familiar idea outwitting Cheap Jack he held fast, however. “It nothing thee have,” he said slowly; “but do not mind ’ee knowin’ much, Jack, ’ee cannot get un; haw, haw! Not unless ’ee robs savings-bank.” The dwarf’s eyes twinkled, he affected secure pictures hung low, he said carelessly,— “Savings-banks good places poor man lay in. They takes small sums, shillings comes useful honest man, George, dear, does not go far business.” “Shillings!” cried George, indignantly; “pounds!” And then, doubtful he said much, he added, “A do not much mind ’ee knowing, Jack, ’ee cannot get  them!” “It is pity you are poor scholar, George,” said Cheap Jack, turning round, looking full his friend; “you are sharp, that, dear. You do not think counts money head till makes is, now, eh?” “A keep things yead,” said George, “better folks keep book; I knows I has, folks cannot get at. I knows I put un in. First, five-pound bill”— “They must stared see bring five pound lump, George, dear!” said hunchback. “Was wise, think?” “Gearge bean’t vool looks,” replied miller’s man. “A took good care change first, Cheap John, put bits.” “You are clever customer, George,” said his friend. “Well, dear? First, five-pound bill, then?” George looked puzzled, then, suddenly, angry. “What you?” he asked, forthwith relapsed sulky fit, Cheap Jack found impossible rouse him. All attempts renew subject, induce miller’s man talk all, proved fruitless. The Cheap Jack insisted, however, taking friendly leave. “Good-by, dear,” said he, “till mop. You knows place town, I shall expect you.” The miller’s man replied defiant nod, possibly meant he would come, appearance expressing sarcastic wish Cheap Jack might see occasion alluded to. In obedience yell master, white horse started forward, much say journey town made pleasant poor beast fact Cheap Jack good deal long-suppressed fury vent upon somebody. It perhaps well bones white horse that, entered town, Cheap Jack brushed woman narrow foot-path, turned remonstrate civil terms, suddenly checked herself, said low voice, “Juggling Jack!” The dwarf started, looked woman puzzled air. She middle-aged woman, earlier half middle age; she shabbily dressed, face would ill-looking, upper lip long cleft, lower one unusually large. As Cheap Jack still stared silence, she burst noisy laugh, saying, “More know Jack Fool Jack Fool knows.” But, even she spoke, gleam recognition suddenly spread hunchback’s face, and, putting his hand, he said, “Sal! _you here_, dear?” “The air London do not agree now,” reply; “and you, Jack?” “The country air’s beginning disagree me, dear,” said hunchback; “but I am glad see you, Sal. Come here, dear, let us talk, little refreshment.” The place refreshment dwarf alluded another public-house, White Horse name. There need bid Cheap Jack’s white horse pause here; he stopped every public-house; nineteen times twenty great convenience his master, he got thanks; twentieth time hunchback want stop, he lavish abuse beast’s stupidity coming standstill. The white horse drooped his soft white nose weary neck long, long time effigy his namesake swinging overhead, Cheap Jack come out, he seemed preoccupied tired beast got home fewer blows usual. He unloaded his cart mechanically, dream; he touched pictures, seemed awaken fresh train thought. He stamped one his little feet spitefully ground, and, pretty close imitation George’s dialect, said bitterly, “Gearge bean’t vool looks!” adding, pause, “I would deal pay _him_ off!” As he turned house, he said thoughtfully, “Sal’s precious sharp; she allus was. And fine woman, too, Sal!” * * * * * Not long incidents related, happened business called Mrs. Lake neighboring town. She seldom went out, well-to-do aunt sick, wished see her; miller gave his consent her going. She met milk-cart corner road, driven town, she took Jan her. He begged hard go, intensely amused he saw. The young Lakes thoroughly habit taking every thing, whether commonplace curious, phlegmatic fashion, Jan’s pleasure new pleasure his foster-mother, enjoyed greatly. As making way towards inn pick neighbor, whose cart driven home, progress hindered crowd, collected near one churches. Mrs. Lake one people lead colorless lives, without mental resources, calamity almost delightful, stimulus gives imagination, relief affords monotony existence. “Oh, dear! oh, dear!” she cried, peering crowd: “I wonder is. It Is likely it is man fit now, I should not wonder, cart upset, every soul killed, might going home evening. Dear, dear! it is venturesome thing leave home, too!” “’Ere be! ’ere be!” roared wave crowd, composed boys, breaking Mrs. Lake Jan point. “It Is body, sure death!” murmured windmiller’s wife; but, she spoke, street boys set lusty cheer, Jan, escaped explore his account, came running back, crying,— “It Is Cheap Jack, mammy! he is getting married.” If thing could rivalled interest sudden death Mrs. Lake, must wedding this. She hurried front, time catch sight happy couple passed street, escorted crowd congratulating boys. [Picture: If thing could rivalled interest sudden death Mrs. Lake, must wedding this] “Well done, Cheap John!” roared one. “You have chose beauty, have,” cried another. “She is ’arf ’ead taller, anyway,” added third. “Many happy returns day, Jack!” yelled fourth. Jan charmed, he drew Mrs. Lake’s attention fact really _was_ Cheap Jack. But windmiller’s wife staring bride. Not merely bride commonly considered central figure wedding-party, her face seemed familiar Mrs. Lake, she could remember she seen her. Though she could remember nothing, association seemed one pain. In vain she beat her brains. Memory almost uncultivated quality her, and, like rest her intellectual powers, nervous, skittish way deserting her need, timidity. Mrs. Lake could sometimes remember things she got bed, occasion her pillow assist her; windmiller snubbed her making “such caddle” woman’s face she might seen anywhere nowhere, matter; she got help him. And till Cheap Jack his wife left neighborhood, one night (she bed) suddenly “came her,” she said, dwarf’s bride woman brought Jan mill, night great storm. CHAPTER XIV. SUBLUNARY ART.—JAN GOES TO SCHOOL.—DAME DATCHETT AT HOME.—JAN’S FIRST SCHOOL SCRAPE.—JAN DEFENDS HIMSELF. EVEN hero tale cannot always heroic, romantic poetic tastes. The wonderful beauty night sky moon fully felt artist-nature child Jan; time he took study totally different subject,—pigs. It force circumstances led Jan “make pigs” his slate constantly, instead nobler subjects; dated time his foster-mother began send children school Dame Datchett’s. Dame Datchett’s cottage last house one side village main street. It low, thatched, creeper-covered, one floor, two rooms,—the outer room Dame kept her school, inner one she slept. Dame Datchett’s scholars young, hoped chief objects parents paying schooling insure kept safely way certain portion day, saving wear tear clothes shoes. It hoped so, much discipline extent accomplished. As learning, Dame Datchett little enough herself, quite unable impart even that, except industrious intelligent pupil. Her school appurtenances simple. From one arose Jan’s first scrape school. It long, narrow blackboard, alphabet painted white, though letters faded Dame could longer distinguish them, even spectacles. The scrape came thus. As he stood bottom little class gathered semicircle around Dame’s chair, his young eyes could see faded letters quite clearly, though Dame’s could not. “Say th’ alphabet, childern!” cried Dame Datchett; class shouted names letters her, she made show pointing long “sallywithy” wand cut one willows water-meadows below. She ran sallywithy along board she esteemed judicious rate, keep pace shouted alphabet, but, she could see letters, her tongue her wand accord. Little wide-mouthed, white-headed youngsters village heed this, troubled Jan’s eyes; when—in consequence her rubbing her nose her disengaged hand—the sallywithy slipped Q Dame cried F, Jan brought lore he gained Abel bear upon her inaccuracy. “It Is Q, F,” he said, boldly aloud. A titter ran class, biggest stupidest boy found joke overwhelming he stretched his mouth ear ear, doubled laughter, till looked his corduroy-breeched knee turnip, he munch it. The Dame dropped her sallywithy began feel her chair. “Which young varment said F Q?” she rather unfairly inquired. “A did not say F Q”— began Jan; chorus cowardly little voices drowned him, curried favor Dame crying, “It Is Jan Lake, miller’s son, missus.” And big boy, conscious his breach good manners, atoned officiously dragging Jan Dame Datchett’s elbow. “Hold un vor me,” said Dame, settling her spectacles firmly her nose. And infinite delight great booby held Jan receive his thwacks strap Dame late years substituted birch rod. And Jan writhed, he chuckled heartily before, amiable feature character clowns that, long enjoy guffaw somebody is expense, subject ridicule matter much choice discrimination. After first angry sob, Jan set his teeth bore his punishment proud silence, quite incomprehensible small rustics him, who, like pigs district, habit crying good time hurt preventive measure. Strangely enough, gave biggest boy impression Jan “poor-spirited,” unable take his part,—a temptation bully strong resisted. So school broke up, children scattering road water-meads, wide-mouthed boy came Jan snatched his slate him. “Give Jan his slate!” cried Jan, indignantly. He five years old, seven, he held slate his head. “And _Jan_, then, thee little gallus-bird?” said he, tauntingly. “I Jan!” answered little fellow, defiantly. “Jan Lake, miller’s son. Give I his slate!” “Thee’s miller’s son,” said other; rest children began gather round. “I miller’s son,” reiterated January “And I have got miller’s thumb, too;” he turned his little thumb confirmation fact. “Thee’s miller’s son,” repeated other, grin. “Thee’s nobody’s child, thee is. Master Lake’s thy vather, Mrs. Lake bean’t thy mother. Thee brought mill sack grist, thee was.” In saying which, boy repeated popular version Jan’s history. If one present outside Dame Datchett’s cottage moment windmill Jan first came it, he would seen likeness vivid face child face man brought mill would seemed clear least one point mystery his parentage. Pride wrath convulsed every line square, quaint face, seemed narrow likeness man’s, as, his black eyes blazing passion, Jan flew his enemy. The boy still held Jan’s slate high, derisive “haw! haw!” he brought heavily Jan’s head. But Jan’s eye quick, true. He dodged blow, fell boy’s knees, flew like kitten tiger fury. They small easily knocked over, instant sprawling road, cuffing, pulling, kicking, punching equal success, except bigger boy prudently roared howled time, hope securing assistance his favor. “Dame Datchett! Missus! Murder! Yah! Boohoo! The little varment throttling I.” But Mrs. Datchett deaf. Also, she unnaturally considered that, looking “the young varments” school-hours, she fully earned weekly pence, means bound disturb herself squabbled street. Meanwhile Jan gradually got upper hand his lubberly far courageous opponent, whose smock he nearly torn his back. He spent his breath calling aid, now, reply boy’s cries mercy release, he shouted, “What name, now, thee big gawney? Speak, I will drottle ’ee.” “Jan Lake,” said his vanquished foe. “Let go! Yah! yah!” “Whose son I?” asked remorseless January “Abel Lake’s, miller! Boohoo, boohoo!” sobbed boy. “And this, then, Willum Smith?” Jan’s final question, he brought his thumb close his enemy’s eye. “It miller’s thumb thee’s got, Jan Lake,” satisfactory answer. CHAPTER XV. WILLUM GIVES JAN SOME ADVICE.—THE CLOCK FACE.—THE HORNET AND THE DAME.—JAN DRAWS PIGS.—JAN AND HIS PATRONS.—KITTY CHUTER.—THE FIGHT.—MASTER CHUTER’S PREDICTION. JAN went back school. Though his foster-mother indignant, ready battle Dame Datchett William Smith’s aunt (with whom, lieu parents, boy lived), though Abel expressed his anxiety go “teach Willum vight one his zize,” Jan steadily rejected help, said manfully, “Jan bean’t feared un. I whopped un, I did.” So Mrs. Lake doctored his bruises, sent school again. She yielded readily she felt certain windmiller would take child’s part Dame. No misfortune befell him. William, loutish bit bully occasion, ill-natured child; and, turn humor broad, unintellectual sort, he Jan became rather friendly common, reprehensible ground playing pranks, kept school titter Dame doubt. And, detected, think dose strap means high price pay fun. For William’s sufferings instrument discipline measured his doleful howlings roarings, even his ready tears. “What ’ee voolish say nothing her wollops ’ee?” he asked Jan, friendly spirit, one day. “Thee holler loud ’ee can. Them hollers cries murder she soon stops for, Dame Datchett. She feared mothers hearing  them, comin’  them.” Jan could lower accept base advice; his superior adroitness much balance advantage William him, less scrupulous pride. As learning, I fear that, untoward consequences his zeal alphabet, Jan made effort learn thing cat’s-cradle his neighbors. On one occasion, indeed, he somewhat over-zealous, escaped strap his reward friendly diversion part his friend. The Dame Dutch clock corner her kitchen, figures face common Arabic ones, Roman. And one things Dame professed “teach clock,” she would, figures recited fashion her scholars shouted alphabet, set advanced use slates copy figures clock-face. Slowly sorrowfully William toil lesson. Again he rub his ill-proportioned fives, greasy finger superabundance moisture make sort puddle, he dug heavily, broke two pencils. “A vive akkerd vigger,” he muttered, reply Jan, looked inquiringly second pencil snapped. “’Twill come aal right, though, dries.” It dry, thing right. Jan rubbed mass thick blotted strokes, Dame looking, he made William’s figures him. Jan behindhand spelling, copy figures difficulty him. Having helped his friend thus, he pulled his smock, draw attention his slate. The children wrote slowly time hung heavy his hands; and, instead copying figures row, he made drawing clock-face, figures it; instead hands, he put eyes, nose, mouth, mouth round gray blot, William instantly recognized portrait mole Dame Datchett’s chin. This brilliant caricature tickled him, he fit choking suppressed laughter; he Jan, detected “in mischief,” summoned slates Dame’s chair. William came triumphant; Dame caught sight Jan’s slate, without minutely examining his work, she said, “Zo thee’s scraaling thee slate, instead writing thee figures,” began fumble beneath her chair. [Picture: “Zo thee’s scraaling thee slate, instead writing thee figures,” began fumble beneath her chair] But William slightly moved strap his foot, he stood perfectly unmoved vacant countenance beside Dame, made delay; Mrs. Datchett bent lower right side her chair, William began upon left “hum,” which, close imitation crowing cock, grunting pig, braying donkey, formed his chief stock accomplishments. “Drat thing! Where un?” said Dame, endangering her balance search. “B-z-z-z-z!” went William behind chair; he added, _sotto voce_, Jan, “She dunch bittle.” At last Dame heard, looked round. “Be harnet, missus, ’ee think?” said William, face guileless babe’s. Dame Datchett rose terror. William bent look beneath her chair hornet, course repeated his hum. As hornet could neither found got rid of, alarmed old lady broke school, went lay trap brown sugar outside window her enemy. And Jan escaped beating. But story his first fight digressions. It yet remains told he took drawing pigs. Dame Datchett’s cottage last one side street; face street, looked water-meadows, little river, bridge. As Jan sat end form, he could look Dame’s open door, chief view place close bridge, river’s bank, pig-minders village brought pigs water. Day day, tedium nothing Dame Datchett’s superintendence insufficiently relieved Jan’s active mind pinching “Willum” till he giggled, playing cat’s-cradle one his foster-brothers, he welcome sight flock pigs keeper, scuttling past Dame’s door, rushing snorting stream. Much he envied freedom happy pig-minder, whilst vagaries pigs unfailing source amusement. The degree variety expression pig’s eye appreciated studied pigs Morland must studied them. The pertness, liveliness, humor, love mischief, fiendish ingenuity perversity pigs capable, fully known careworn pig-minder alone. When running away,—and running away?—they action hind legs like donkey state revolt. But none donkey’s numerous grievances. And donkeys squealed every switch, pigs do, undeserved sufferings would cried loud enough vengeance this. Jan’s opportunities studying pigs good. As smallest swiftest flock, his tail tightly curled, indescribable jauntiness his whole demeanor, came bounding river’s brink, followed his fellows, driving, pushing, snuffing, winking, gobbling, lastly small boy large coat, long switch, Jan witness whole scene Dame Datchett’s door. And, he sat his slate pencil him, he naturally took drawing quaint comic faces expressive eyes herd, hardly less expressive backs tails; depicting scenes took place pigs enjoyed refreshment, renewed vigor led keeper twenty different directions, instead going home. Back, road, he could hardly drive point switch hours before; sharp turns Squire Ammaby’s grounds, churchyard; helter-skelter water-meadows. The fame Jan’s “pitcher-making” gone Dame Datchett’s school mouths his foster-brothers sisters, he found dozen little voices ready dictate subjects his pencil. “Make ’ouse, Janny Lake.” “Make thee vather’s mill, Janny Lake.” “Make man. Make Dame Datchett. Make parson. Make Cheap Jack. Make Daddy Angel. Make Master Chuter. Make oss—cow—ship—pig!” But popularity obtained Jan’s pigs soon surpassed his performances. “Make pigs I, Janny Lake!” “Make pigs I, too!” sort whispering chorus went perpetually Dame’s nose. But she found led disturbance, children huddled round child Jan his slate like eager scholars round teacher, Dame Datchett wise enough thankful Jan possessed power she never able acquire,—that he could “keep young varments quiet.” “He most’s good’s monitor,” thought Dame; she took nap, Jan’s genius held school together. The children tried influences besides persuasion. “Jan Lake, I have brought thee apple. Draa pig I a’s slate.” Jan spirit upright honorable kind. He never took unfair advantage, petty cunning “Willum’s” idea wisdom he seemed nature incapable stooping. But addition to, alongside of, his artistic temperament, appeared small share spirit trader. The capricious, artistic spirit made fitful his use even beloved slate; but, he least inclined draw, offer something he much wanted would spur work; spirit true trader, he worked well. He would made charming study painter, he sat surrounded his patrons, watched gaping mouths wonderment, his black eyes moved rapidly fro river’s brink his slate, his tiny fingers steered pencil cunning lines “made pigs.” “The moral!” William declared, smacking his corduroy breeches delight. Sometimes Jan hardly knew there, he absorbed his work. His eyes glowed strong pleasure comes learning art, perhaps craft. Now then, indeed, his face would cloud different expression, fits annoyance, like his foster-mother found outside windmill, he would break his pencils, ruthlessly destroy sketches his patrons would quite satisfied. But moments his face would twinkle sunshine smiles, he conscious caught exactly curve expressed obstinacy pig’s back, air reckless defiance other’s tail. And he learned little nothing, improved his drawing, kept school quiet, always pocket well filled sweet things, nails, string, tops, balls, treasures, earned his art. One day he sat “making pigs” one another group children round him, pig especial humor drawn murmur delight circle, murmur dismally echoed sob little maid outside group. It Master Chuter’s little daughter, pretty child, oval, dainty-featured face, prim gentleness her, like good little girl good little story. The intervening young rustics began nudge look back her. “Kitty Chuter crying!” whispered. “What amiss ’ee, then, Kitty Chuter?” said Jan, looking his work; question passed impatience, her tears prevented her reply. “What amiss ’ee?” “Janny Lake never made pig I,” sobbed little maid, her head dolefully inclined her left shoulder, her oval face pulled doubly pensive length. “I axed vather let get posy, said I might. And I got un vine Bloody Warriors, heap Boy’s Love big bush, smelled beautiful. And vather says water-blobs pond blows. But Tommy Green met I coming school, snatched vlowers me, I begged un let keep un, laughed me. And I dare not go back, I late; I have nothing give Janny Lake make draft pig I.” And, held telling her tale, little maid broke fresh tears. Jan finished tail pig he drawing squeak pencil might come pig and, stuffing slate owner’s hands, he ran Kitty Chuter kissed her wet cheeks, saying, “Give I thee slate, Kitty Chuter, I will make thee best pig all. I do not want nothing thee ’t. And school’s done, I will whop Tommy Green, I sees him.” And forthwith, without looking door studies, Jan drew fat sow her little ones her; children clustering round peep, crying, “He have made Kitty Chuter one, two, three, vour, _vive_ pigs!” “Ah, two cannot see, old un lying  them,” said January “Six, seven!” William counted; he assisted calculation sticking first thumb forefinger he spoke. Some thought half ball string, dozen nails good new, much pay single pig drawn one side slates, lasting long could contrive keep side use without quite smudging one, disposed dissatisfied bargains. But school broke up, Tom Green seen loitering side road, every thing forgotten general desire see Jan carry his threat, “whop” boy bigger bullying little girl. Jan showed disposition shirk, William acted his friend, held his slate book. Success always just, however; poor Jan terribly beaten his big opponent, though without giving marks combat carry away. Kitty Chuter wept bitterly Jan’s bloody nose; he comforted her, saying, “Never mind, Kitty; he plagues thee again,  will fight un again, till I whops he.” But his valor put proof, Tommy Green molested her more. Jan washed his face water-meadows, went stout-heartedly home, Master Lake beat afresh, he ironically said, “to teach vight young varments like instead minding his book.” But upon Master Chuter, Heart Oak, incident made quite different impression. He naturally pleased Jan’s championship his child, and, added this, he much impressed sketch slate. It was, he said, “living likeness” his sow; and, she seven young pigs, portrait exact, allowing two Jan said sight. He gave Kitty new slate, kept sketch, he showed in-comers. He displayed one evening company assembled round hearth little inn, took occasion propound his views subject Jan’s future life. (Master Chuter fond propounding his views,—a taste developed always sure audience.) “It is nothing me,” said Master Chuter, speaking Jan, “who boy be. It fault his’n he is fondling. And one thing’s sure enough. Them left Master Lake left something besides him. There advertisement,—you remember five-pound bill paper, Daddy Angel?” “Ay, ay, Master Chuter,” said Daddy Angel; “after big storm, five year ago. Sartinly, Master Chuter.” “Was ever found, ye think?” said Master Linseed, painter decorator. “It must found,” said landlord; “but I bean’t sure it is given up, notice long. And whoever find un must found un once. But I says is, five-pound notes lost easy comes there is sort. And, Master Lake paid boy, he ’fford ’prentice his time comes. He have boys enough his take mill, Jan seem uncommon turn drawing things out, I would try painting varnishing, he mine. And I believe he would come signs, too! Look that, now! It small, boy’ve paint lay on, there is sign Jolly Sow you, natteral life. You know signs, Master Linseed,” continued landlord. For tradition painter could “do picture-signs,” though he known renew lettered ones since he came neighborhood. “Master Lake ’prentice he is older,” Master Chuter said conclusion. But Master Linseed respond warmly. He felt little beneath his dignity sign-painter jump idea, though rest company assented general murmur. “Scrawling slate,” painter decorator began—and point he paused, leisurely customs district, light his pipe leaden-weighted candlestick stood near; then, his hearers sat expectant, impatient, proceeded: “Scrawling slate one thing, Master Chuter: painting decorating’s another. Painting’s trade; rightly understood that is larned it, picked scrawl line line there, whim takes  them. Take oak-graining,”—and Master Linseed paused again, fine sense effect,—“who would ever think taking comb did not know? And knots, I have worked  them—now finger thumb—over shutter-front till looked beautiful man done telled himself,—‘I would rather,’ says he, ‘have  them you have done  them real thing.’ But young hands nowhere knots. They puts  them thick.” The company said, “Ay, ay!” tone unbroken assent, Master Linseed understood “come distance,” “know good deal.” But innkeeper stands painter decorator anywhere, especially his hearth, Master Chuter mean put down. “I suppose old hands young uns once, Master Linseed,” said he; “and boy never much oak-graining, I would back sign-painting, he taught. Why, pigs he draas out, look you. I could cut  them up, piece missing; joint, much would make pound sausages. And draas pigs, osses, kind?” “Ay, ay!” said company. “I thinking,” continued Master Chuter, “of gentlemen draad mare father’s ran mail. You remember coaches, Daddy Angel?” “Ay, ay, Master Chuter. Between Lonnon Exeter ran. Fine days Heart Oak, then, Master Chuter.” “He were not sign-painter, I knows on. A something gentry way,” said Master Chuter, not, perhaps, quite without malice distinction. “He calls genteel talk a”— “Artis’,” said Master Linseed, removing his pipe, supply missing word sense superiority. “No, artis’,” said Master Chuter, “though begin A, too. ’Twasn’t artis’ he was, it was a”— “Ammytoor,” said travelled sign-painter. “That it,” said innkeeper. “A ammytoor. And he short money, I fancy, it was settled paint mare father’s set bill. And draad squinted un, squinted un draad, laid paint till pictur’ looked mess, he took un away vinish. But sent home, I thought vather would law un. I am blessed had not given mare four white feet, shoulders would not pulled vegetable cart; she near-wheeler mail! I would lay pound bill Jan Lake would done her ever much better, young hand is, a’d squinted her long.” “Well, well, Master Chuter,” said painter decorator, rising go, “let boy draw pigs osses his living. And I wish he may find paint easy slate-pencil.” Master Linseed’s parting words produced upon company somewhat unreasonable depression ironical good wishes apt because; roused spirit contradiction Master Chuter, heightened his belief Jan’s talents praise painter could done. “Here is pretty caddle giving boy’s due!” said innkeeper. “But I knows points oss, makings pig, I bean’t sign-painter. And, mark words, boy Jan ’ull out-paint Master Linseed yet.” Master Chuter spoke triumph his tone, triumph delivering his sentiments unopposing hearers. There moments greater triumph come, he yet wotted not, sevenfold fulfilment his prediction past dispute, attested his walls lasting monuments Jan’s skill perishable sketch stood like text innkeeper mantelpiece Heart Oak. CHAPTER XVI. THE MOP.—THE SHOP.—WHAT THE CHEAP JACK’S WIFE HAD TO TELL.—WHAT GEORGE WITHHELD. A MOP local name hiring-fair, young men women present hired domestic servants farm laborers year. It mop windmiller hired George, annual festival his long service came end. He betook town, fair going on, definite intention seeking another master, variety reasons: partly holiday, “see fun;” partly visit Cheap Jack, hear advice he give, learn letter; partly idea something might suggest busy town suitable investment his savings his talents. At worst, he could take another place. The sun shone brightly market-place George passed it. The scene quaint picturesque. Booths, travelling shows, penny theatres, quack doctors, tumblers, profile cutters, exhibitors salesmen sorts, thronged square, overflowed space behind, houses burnt never rebuilt; whilst round remains market cross centre grouped lads lasses “on hire.” The girls smartly dressed, young men snowy smocks, peeped waistcoats gay colors, looked earlier part day spruce, lamentable see hours beer-drinking shag tobacco-smoking followed, see might neighborly cheerful festival finally swamped drunkenness debauchery. George’s smock white, George’s waistcoat red, he made smart enough, he linger amongst his fellow-servants Cross. He hurried crowd, nodding sheepishly answer shower chaff greetings, made his way by-street Cheap Jack small dingy shop sale coarse pottery. Some people spiteful enough hint shop-trade much less value store-room attached, goods believed one kind. The red bread-pans, pipkins, flower-pots, forth, grouped door attempt effective display, cheap prices marked chalk upon sides. The window clean, many knick-knacks kinds mixed smaller china ware. And, George entered shop, hunchback’s wife behind counter. Like Mrs. Lake, he paused think he could seen her before; uncomely face marred ugly mouth, upper lip long cleft, lower lip large heavy, seemed familiar him. He still beating his brains Cheap Jack came in. George puzzled woman’s countenance seem new him, he puzzled disturbed also expression face Cheap Jack quite new. Whatever hunchback his head, however, he unfriendly his manner. “Good morning, George, dear!” he cried, cheerfully; “you have seen missus before, eh, George?” George say no, he remembered he seen woman, where. “Dreadful night was, Mr. Sannel!” said Cheap Jack’s wife, smile her large mouth. George assented, hospitable invitation newly married couple he followed dwelling part house, trying he decide upon plan his future conduct. Here last woman could probably tell he wanted know mystery he hoped trade, and—the Cheap Jack married her. If thing could got knowledge Jan’s history, Cheap Jack, George, would get now. The hasty resolution George came try share he could keep entirely himself. He flattered he could civil, and—he got letter. It proved useful. George resolved show he got something large-mouthed woman tell; and, she wanted see letter, she made virtue necessity, seemed anxious help miller’s man utmost her power. The history her connection Jan’s babyhood soon told, she told truthfully. Five years her marriage Cheap Jack, she chambermaid small hotel London, “under notice leave.” Why—she deem necessary tell George. In hotel Jan born, Jan’s mother died. She foreigner, supposed, her husband also, talked foreign language other. He her she first came, he joined her afterwards, her her death. So far Cheap Jack’s wife spoke upon hearsay. Though employed hotel, full, she sleeping house; she good terms landlady, even servants, her first real connection matter gentleman, overhearing “words” her landlady bar, abruptly asked her she want employment. He employed her,—to take child town she living Cheap Jack’s wife. He come her, he attend his wife’s funeral. It understood hotel he going take body abroad interment. So porter said. The person she directed bring child respectable old woman, living outskirts town, whose business sick-nursing. She seemed, however, comfortably off, time. She nurse gentleman his childhood, she told Cheap Jack’s wife tears. But she always shedding tears, either baby, she sat her big Bible, “for ever wipe her spectacles, tears running her nose ridic’lus behold.” She pious, read Bible aloud evening. Then she fainting fits; she could go uphill upstairs without great difficulty, she one her fits she first saw child. If infirmities body mind ex-nurse easily managed, Cheap Jack’s wife professed she could borne patience. But old woman painfully shrewd, hoodwinking her. She never allowed Cheap Jack’s wife go without her, contrived, spite hundred plans excuses, prevent her speaking townspeople alone. Never, said Sal, never could she put it, even short time gentleman came them, knowing would paying job. But his arrival signal another catastrophe, ended Jan’s becoming child mill. If sight baby nearly overpowered old nurse, sight dark-eyed gentleman overwhelmed her yet more. Then closeted together long time, old woman’s tongue hardly ever stopped. Sal explained she would fool let conversation escape her, she could helped it. She took her place keyhole, excuse ready old woman, she come suddenly. The old woman came suddenly; she wait excuse. She sent Cheap Jack’s wife civilly errand kitchen, followed her, shut door turned key upon her without hesitation, leaving her unable hear thing tones conversation parlor wall. She never opened door again. As far Cheap Jack’s wife could tell, old woman seemed remonstrating pleading; gentleman spoke then. Then lull, thud, short pause, parlor-door burst open, gentleman came flying towards kitchen, calling Cheap Jack’s wife. The fact door locked caused delay, delay desirable. The old nurse “a fit.” When doctor came, he gave hope her life. She heart disease many years, he said. In midst confusion, letter came gentleman, seemed absolutely distract him. He bade Sal get little Jan ready, put his clothes together, started evening mill. Sal believed doctor recommended Mrs. Lake foster-mother baby, attended her child. The storm came started. The child sickly ever since left London. The gentleman took Cheap Jack’s wife straight back station, paid her handsomely, sent her town again. She never seen since. As his name, happened she never heard hotel; he setting her country child, she asked it, he told her Ford. The old nurse also spoke Mr. Ford, but—so Sal fancied—with sort effort, made her suspect his real name. “Yes, be!” said George, followed narrative open-mouthed interest. “It aal right. I knows. It Was gentleman name Ford cried his pocket-book, vive-pound bill papers. It Is aal right. Ford—Jan Ford little varment’s name then, he gentry-born, too! Missus Lake she allus said so, she did, sartinly.” George absorbed flood information burst upon once, adjusting his clumsy thoughts new view Jan, he stop think whether Cheap Jack his wife known lost pocket-book reward. They not. The dark gentleman wish reopen communication woman he employed. He thought (and rightly) book fallen he stumbled his cloak getting carriage, he refused advertise except local papers. And time Cheap Jack Sal London. But George’s incautious speech recalled one two facts them, whilst George sat slowly endeavoring realize new idea, “Master Jan Ford, full young gentleman, least half Frenchman” (for foreigners George knew nothing), Cheap Jack pondering words “five-pound bill,” connecting George’s account his savings last met; his quicker spouse also putting two two together, larger sum. At instant Cheap Jack inquired George’s money, his wife asked letter. But George hastily come decision. If tale told woman true, he got great deal information nothing, he saw reason sharing whatever letter might contain likely profit it. As letting Cheap Jack thing whatever disposal his savings, nothing could his intentions. “Gearge bean’t vool looks,” thought worthy, aloud he vowed, unnecessary oaths, money still bank, he forgotten bring letter, bundle he left mill. This disappointment not, however, diminish civility Cheap Jack’s wife. She hospitable, even pressed George spend night house, he declined. He dread Cheap Jack, almost superstitious. For her civility, indeed, Cheap Jack’s wife taken task her husband moments alone together. “I thought sharper took him!” said hunchback, indignantly. “Do believe gag bank bundle? you, soft him, telling every blessed thing, he stowed cash letter somewheres shall never catch sight  them, got every thing easy shelling pod peas.” And language strong miller’s man Cheap Jack swore he could done better hundred times over. “Could you?” said large-mouthed woman, contemptuously. “I would not live long country, I would not, make owl you have turned into. It are not much farther nose _you_ sees!” “Never mind me, Sal, dear,” said hunchback, anxiously. “I trusts you, dear. And seems thought he would got  them him. Do you, dear, why? And tell truth, straight end, made-up tale would done well, kept dark?” “Why I tell truth?” repeated woman. “’Cos I are not countrified fool think lies allus cleverest tip, ’cos truth went farthest time. Why I think he is got  them him? First, ’cos he swore steady he had not. For ready lie, acting lie, over-acting times, give townspeople; thundering big un, reason, sticking stupid they are downright convicted, face innercent baby’s, give country lump. And next, I tell folks deal sharper him, even side  them pocket they have got wants hide in, way moves head hands.” “Which side him, Sal?” said hunchback, ugly eagerness. “The left,” said Sal; “but will not long.” CHAPTER XVII. THE MILLER’S MAN AT THE MOP.—A LIVELY COMPANION.—SAL LOSES HER PURSE.—THE RECRUITING SERGEANT.—THE POCKET-BOOK TWICE STOLEN.—GEORGE IN THE KING’S ARMS.—GEORGE IN THE KING’S SERVICE.—THE LETTER CHANGES HANDS, BUT KEEPS ITS SECRET. FOR years ex-servant windmill rather favored fortune otherwise. He found pocket-book, and, though he could read letter, he got five-pound note. Since then, his gains, honest dishonest, much beyond his needs, his savings small. Suspicion beginning connect his name Cheap Jack certain thefts committed neighborhood, he made his mind go. His wealth generally known. Many time he tempted buy pigs (a common speculation district, first stone one rustic fortune), dread exciting suspicion balanced almost certain profit, he could never make his mind. For Master Lake paid five pounds year his man’s valuable services, which, even district time habits simple, boots made brown paper, leave much margin purchase pigs. The pig speculation, though profitable, safe. George made money, however, he escaped detection. On whole, he fortunate. But mop saw turn tide his affairs, ended strangely him. It began otherwise. George never felt convinced his power help expense his neighbors he getting Sal’s information, keeping back his own, started join amusements fair. He good terms himself; none less he failed see Cheap Jack’s chagrin, woman poured forth she knew George’s benefit, got nothing return. The vanity ignorant knows check except without; flattery, boundless, Cheap Jack’s wife found difficulty fooling George top his bent. George rather proud, too, his companion. She not, said, ill-looking her mouth, beauty abundant enough neighborhood place her much disadvantage. Fashionable finery even less common, Cheap Jack’s wife showily dressed. And George found her pleasant companion; much livelier slow-witted damsels country-side. For she nothing flattery; her smart speeches expense people crowd caused miller’s man double his long back laughter. A large proportion country wives sweethearts tramped fair heels husbands swains, like squaws Indian spouses. But Cheap Jack’s wife asked George his arm,—the left one,—and she clung day. “Quite lady her manners she be,” thought George. She called “Mr. Sannel,” too. George felt she admired him. For moment his satisfaction checked, she called his attention good looks handsome recruiting sergeant, strutting mop air expressing much belonged he did not belong it. “But there, he are not hold candle you, Mr. Sannel, though his coat sit well upon him,” said Cheap Jack’s wife. It gratified George’s standing ill-will Cheap Jack “cut out” showy lady, laugh loudly her upon his arm, whilst hunchback followed, like discontented cur, heels. If drawback merits his lively companion, her power charming money George’s pocket. The money he disbursed came right-hand pocket his red waistcoat. In left-hand pocket (and pockets, like pattern waistcoat, large) lost pocket-book. It small one, fitted nicely. In pocket-book George’s savings, chiefly paper. Notes portable coin, and, George meant invest somewhere he known, suspicions need raised value. The letter also. There plenty shows mop, Cheap Jack’s wife saw all. The travelling wax-works; menagerie mangy lion appallingly rickety cage; fat Scotchman, monster made horrible view dress royal Stuart tartan; penny theatre, mermaid pickling-tub. One treat she declined. The miller’s man would paid shilling portrait her, she refused taken. The afternoon wearing away, Sal caught sight country bumpkins upon stage, preparing grin horse-collars prize hat. As she never seen heard entertainment, George explained her. It contest ugliest prize. Only widest-mouthed, grotesque-looking clowns place attempted compete; he who, besides ugliest nature, could “grin” contort his features mode tickled fancy beholders. George competed himself, failed secure hat his nearest rival could squint well grin; he point boasting this, second thoughts he kept fact himself. Very willing indeed he escort his companion show open air nothing charged, plunged valiantly crowd. The crowd huge, George’s height strength stood good stead, he pushed on, dragged Sal him. There confusion stage. A nigger, countenance moved populace roars laughter, applied allowed compete. Opinions divided whether would fair native talent, whilst strong desire see face natural condition “as good play,” additional attractions horse-collar grin. The country clowns stage fumed, nigger grinned bowed, crowd yelled, surged, swayed, weak people got trampled, everybody tightly squeezed, Cheap Jack’s wife alarmed, withdrew her hand George’s arm, begged hold her up, he gallantly did, she meanwhile clinging hands his smock. As hunchback, hardly necessary say he get far crowd, his wife George returned, laughing gayly, found standing outside, sulky face. “Look here, missus,” said he; “you are enjoying yourself, I am not. You have got blunt, hand coppers, I will get pint King’s Arms.” Sal began fumbling find her pocket, she found it, she gave shriek, turned inside out. It empty! If miller’s man enjoyed before, he envied now. The Cheap Jack’s wife poured forth her woes continuous stream complaint. She minutely described purse she lost, age quality her dress, impossibility hole her pocket. She took George’s arm more, insisted upon revisiting every stall show been, see her purse found. Up George toiled her, wiping his face feeling he looked like fool, place turn told might well “look needle bottle hay,” pickpockets plenty mop blackberries September. He tired woman she troublesome, fidgetingly persevering, women apt be, he vexed feel little money left his right-hand pocket. He think feeling left one, merely Cheap Jack standing front him, fear safety contents dawned upon him. It easy woman lose her purse pocket flapping loosely drapery her skirts, thing stowed tightly away man’s waistcoat his smock could stolen broad daylight without his knowledge occur him. As little he guess pickpockets supposed drive brisk trade fair, quickest, cleverest, practised professional Cheap Jack’s wife. She feigned see “something” ground near oyster stall, she said “might be” her purse. As indeed might well thing else, seeing said purse existence. As she left them, George turned Cheap Jack. “Look ’ee here, Jack,” said he; “take thee missus whoam. She seem put about, it is manner use her stopping mop. And I pint something wash throat out. I mortal dry running she. Women make caddle things.” “You might stand pint old friend, George, dear,” said Cheap Jack, following him. But George hurried on, shook his head. “No, no,” said he; “tak’ thee missus whoam, I tell ’ee. She’ve seen much expense to-day, she lost her pus.” With miller’s man escaped King’s Arms, pushed his way farthest end room, large party men drinking smoking. At table near sat recruiting sergeant he noticed before, he examined closely. He uncommon type non-commissioned officers English service. Not intellectual—hardly perhaps interesting—kind good looks, he yet strikingly handsome man. His features good clearly cut; his hair moustache dark, thick, short glossy; his dark eyes quick bright; his figure well-made, better developed; his shapely hands clean, fastidiously trimmed nails (a daintiness common rank sergeant, especially among men acting clerks); stone his signet ring real onyx, looked quite well distance, absence crest conspicuous. He spoke good imitation accent officers he served with, his alertness, his well-trained movements, his upright carriage, his personal cleanliness, he came near looking like gentleman he escaped certain swagger, proved ill-chosen substitute well-bred ease. To George’s eyes visible fault. The sergeant much “the swell” George could imagine man be. George Sannel could never remember distinctness ensuing events afternoon. Dim memories remained sergeant meeting his long stare civilities, he conscious replied less suitably he might wished. At one period, certainly, bets made upon height handsome soldier, respectively, he sure put back back, he proved taller man; somehow impressed upon he look so, carried much better. It also impressed upon him, somehow, he would consent well-dressed, well-fed, well-lodged, expense country, his appearance would quickly rival sergeant, reigning Sovereign would gladly pay, well keep clothe, ornamental bulwark state. At period sergeant undoubtedly told “give name,” name he gave sixpenny ale, he drank sergeant’s expense, followed shandy-gaff, footing. At time reason George put his hand his left-hand waistcoat pocket he never could remember. But he so, found empty, cry he raised ring anguish might awakened pity him, even his ill deeds fully known. The position perplexing, he sober head consider with. That pickpockets abounded well impressed upon his slow intellect, means tracing property lost, crowd confusion mop. True, his property worth “crying,” worth offering reward for. But pocket-book his, letter addressed him; doubtful he even dare run risk claiming them. His first despair succeeded sort drunken fury, he accused men sitting robbing him, swore Cheap Jack, raved till landlord King’s Arms expelled “drunk disorderly,” company refused believe he sum money lose. Exactly where, this, sergeant found him, George could remember, his general impression sergeant’s kindness strong. He could recall he pumped upon his head yard King’s Arms, sober him, George’s request; somewhat clear his brain, his remembrance seeing sergeant wipe his fingers cambric handkerchief seems prove. They paced together arm arm, accurately step might agreeable soldier. George remembered hearing prize money, his loss bagatelle, gathering whole army, profession, opened sort boundless career opportunities man his peculiar talents appearance. There something infectious, too, gay easy style soldier seemed treat fortune, good ill; miller’s man stimulated last vow he fool he looked, would “never say die.” To best his belief, sergeant replied terms showed that, he “in cash,” George’s loss would made good him, pure generosity, spot. As was, he pressed upon his acceptance sum one shilling, miller’s man pocketed tears. What recruit afterwards remember argument skilful sergeant melt his discretion valor? The sun dried dew wolds, sails windmill hung idle morning air, George Sannel made his first march drums fifes, ribbons flying his hat, recruit 206th (Royal Wiltshire) Regiment Foot. * * * * * As Cheap Jack his wife hastened home mop, Sal difficulty restraining her husband’s impatience examine pocket-book walked along. Prudence prevailed, however, opened till home alone. In notes money, George’s savings amounted thirteen pounds. “Pretty well, dear,” said Cheap Jack, grinning hideously. “And letter. Read aloud, Sal, dear; you are better scholar me.” Sal opened thin, well-worn sheet, read word “Moerdyk,” she paused. And, like Abel, she paused long hunchback pressed impatiently look her shoulder. But letter written foreign language, Cheap Jack his wife wiser miller’s man. CHAPTER XVIII. MIDSUMMER HOLIDAYS.—CHILD FANCIES.—JAN AND THE PIG-MINDER.—MASTER SALTER AT HOME.—JAN HIRES HIMSELF OUT. MIDSUMMER came, Dame’s school broke holidays. Jan longed intensely. Not he oppressed labors learning, he wanted doors. Many little one equally eager freedom fields, common child-love hedges ditches, flower-picking, like, intensified Jan deeper pleasure country scenes awoke artist nature within him. That empty sentimentality speak artist nature child, let child-memories artists bear witness! That inspired poet Wordsworth one his best poems, dyed canvas landscape painters indestructible local coloring scenes man’s childhood, hardly denied. That wishes theories many excellent people nothing truth. If children bluff, hearty, charmingly naughty, enviably happy, utterly simple unsentimental beings us wish, assert be, might better them, might not—who say? That healthy, careless, rough ready type one encourage, many agree, cannot agree universal, even much common. It probably imperfect remembrance nursery lives people believe griefs one’s childhood light, joys uncomplicated, tastes simple. A clearer recollection favorite poetry cherished day-dreams early years would probably convince strongest taste tragedy comes one’s teens, inclines melodramatic; sentimentality (of kind) grateful verge mawkishness; simple tastes rather result culture experience natural gifts infancy. But rummaging crude tastes, hot little opinions, romance, countless visions, many affectations nursery days, recalled also real love nature; varying, course, intensity mere love fresh air free romping, destructive taste nosegays, living romance daily walks imaginative child,—a world apart, peopled invisible company, fairies, fancy friends children devise themselves, beasts flowers, love given personality. To romance child-fancy weaves meadows milkmaids stand thick pale, green courts lords ladies live, Jan added world pleasure open gifted keen sense form color. Strange gleams stormy sky, sunshine kingfisher’s plumage rising river, ever-changing beauties him, stirred his heart emotions he could defined. There much see even Dame Datchett’s open door, imagined. Jan’s envy pig-minder reached great height last school-day came. He wanted free time pig-herd brought his pigs water, his wishes fulfilled. The Dame’s flock flock swineherd burst one moment water-meadows, Jan soon conversation latter. “Thee likes pig-minding, I reckon?” said Jan, stripping leaves sallywithy wand, he picked imitate swineherd. “Do I?” said large-coated urchin, wiping his face big sleeve his blue coat. “That is aal thee knows un. I going leave to-morrow, I be. And Master Salter’s got another bwoy, he is not, I do not know, are not nothing I.” Jan learned he eighteen pence week driving pigs wood little distance, fed acorns, beech-mast, etc.; giving water, keeping together, bringing home teatime. He allowed he could drive slowly he pleased, kept pretty well together wood; that, whole, perversity pigs that— “Well, wait till ee tries theeself, Jan Lake, that is aal.” Jan resolved so. He return his foster-brothers mill. He slipped one his solitary expeditions, made his way farm-house Master Salter. Master Salter his wife sat tea kitchen. In cheerful clatter cups, failed hear Jan’s knock; sunshine streaming open doorway broken small body, farmer’s wife looked hastily up, thinking new-born calf got loose, threshold. But January The outer curls his hair gleamed sunlight like aureole his face. He doffed his hat, civility, he held one hand, whilst he fingered slate hung his waist. “Massey upon us!” said farmer, looking instant. “And thee?” “Jan Lake, miller’s son, maester.” “Come in, come in!” cried Master Salter, hospitably. “So Master Lake sent thee message, eh?” “My father did not send me,” said Jan, gravely. “I come myself. Do ’ee want pig-minder, Master Salter?” “Ay, I wants pig-minder. But I reckon thee father cannot spare Abel now. A wish he could. Abel careful pigs, he was, sprack boy, too.” “I will careful, main careful, Master Salter,” said Jan, earnestly. “I likes pigs.” But farmer pondering. “Jan Lake—Jan,” said he. “Be thee boy draad sow her pigs Master Chuter’s little gel?” Jan nodded. “Lor massey!” cried Master Salter. “I’ told’ee, missus, un. Look here, Jan Lake. If thee’ll draa pigs like them, I will give ’ee sixpence new slate, I will try thee week, anyhow.” [Picture: “Lor massey!” cried Master Salter. “I’ told’ee, missus, un. Look here, Jan Lake. If thee’ll draa pigs like them, I will give ’ee sixpence new slate, I will try thee week, anyhow.”] Jan drew slate-pencil his pocket without reply. Mrs. Salter, watching motherly eyes, pushed small stool towards him, he began draw scene he studying daily months past,—pigs water-side. He made dozens sketches. But delight farmer knew bounds. He slapped his knees, he laughed till tears ran his cheeks, and, Jan put wicked eye face hindmost pig, he laughed merrily also. He insensible his talents, stimulus farmer’s approbation gave vigor his strokes. “Here, missus,” cried Master Salter; “get Etherd’s new slate, give un; I will get another he. And there is sixpence, Jan; thee minds pigs well ’ee draas  them, I do not care long ’ee minds mine.” The object his visit accomplished, Jan took his hat depart, important omission struck him, he turned say, “What will ’ee give minding pigs, Master Salter?” Master Salter economical, Jan small, anxious place. “A shilling week,” said farmer. “And his tea?” missus gently suggested. “Well, I do not mind,” said Master Salter. “A shilling week thee tea.” Jan paused. His predecessor eighteen pence imperfect services. Jan meant beyond reproach, felt worth quite much. “I give boy one sixpence,” said farmer, “but thee’s small.” “I am sprack,” said Jan, confidently. “And I fond pigs.” “Massey upon me,” said Master Salter, laughing again. “It Is peart young toad, sartinly. A might fifty year old, ways un. Well, thee shall shilling thee tea, one sixpence without, then.” And seeing Jan glanced involuntarily table, farmer added, “Give un now, missus. I will lay pound bill child hungry.” Jan hungry. He bartered food his “nunchin bag” dinner-time another child’s new slate-pencil. The cakes good, too, Mrs. Salter liberal. He rose greatly her esteem saying grace meat. He cooled his tea his saucer too, raised his lips his little finger stuck stiffly (a mark gentility imparted Mrs. Lake), points conducted utmost propriety. “For received Lord praised,” his form giving thanks; Mrs. Salter added, “Amen,” “Bless his heart!” And Jan, picking his hat, lifted his dark eyes candidly farmer’s face, said much gravity decision,— “I will take shilling week tea, Master Salter, you. And thank kindly, sir, missus likewise.” CHAPTER XIX. THE BLUE COAT.—PIG-MINDING AND TREE-STUDYING.—LEAF-PAINTINGS.—A STRANGER.—MASTER SWIFT IS DISAPPOINTED. WHEN Jan returned windmill, gravely announced he hired pig-minder Master Salter, Mrs. Lake was, she said, “put about.” She considered pig-minding quite beneath dignity her darling, brought forward every objection she could think except real one. But windmiller romantic dreams Jan’s behalf, he decided “it was better he arning shillin’ week gettin’ mischief whoam.” Jan’s ambition, however, satisfied. He wanted blue coat, worn shepherd-boys plains. He mind old was, must large; long skirt sleeves. He woven romance Master Salter’s swineherd his life, he watched week week Dame Datchett’s door envious eyes, even his coat, tails almost sweeping ground, seemed Jan dignified air. And really something said favor sleeves long he could turn back huge cuff summer, turn down, Chinese fashion, his hands winter, keep warm. Such blue coat Abel possessed, suitable mill work, Mrs. Lake easily persuaded give January He refused curtailed, way adapted his figure, it, switch his cutting, he presented Master Salter’s farm good time following morning. It could said Jan’s predecessor exaggerated perversity pigs he drove. If coat his choice fault Jan’s estimation, helped make hot he ran hither thither his flock. But he studied pig-nature vain. He good deal sympathy vagaries, he quite able outwit pigs. Indeed, curious attachment grew little swineherd his flock, would come his call, he rewarded affection, he gained it, scratching backs rough stick. But times playful errant peculiarities small annoyance him. Jan growing fast mind body. Phases taste occupation succeed rapidly one young; are, perhaps, distinct phases, sudden strides, art painting. With Jan pig phase going, followed landscape-sketching. Jan drawing his pigs one day little wood, he fancied gnarled elbow branch near had, outline, likeness pig’s face, he began sketch his slate. But studying tree grotesque likeness forgotten, burst upon his mind, revelation, sense world beauty lies among stems branches, twigs leaves. Painfully, happy pains, he traced branch joint joint, curve curve, spread parent stem tapered last delicate twigs. It like following river source sea. But sea summer sky, final ramifications his branch lost, Jan reach. He abruptly stopped edge his slate, would hold more. To remedy this, next he drew trees, he began branches outer tips, worked inwards stem. It done convenience, habit he used afterwards lay merit his admirable touch tree-painting. And “pig-making” became amusement past, spell woods fell January It wonderful wood either, one he first herded pigs studied trees. It composed chiefly oaks beeches, none grand proportions. But little cut little trodden. The bramble-bowers unbroken, leaf-mould deep rich, tiny stream, trickled sight, kept mosses ever green bed. The whole wood fragrant honeysuckle, pushed way everywhere, gay wild flowers. But trees Jan’s delight. He would lie his back gaze unwearying pleasure. He looked his old etching new interest, see artist done branches willows water-mill. And he would get Abel put sharp point his slate-pencil, would go back real oaks beeches, difficult yet fascinating him. He happy wood, two drawbacks. The pigs would stray he became absorbed his sketching, slate slate-pencil, well draw pigs outline, miserable implements, half beauty subject represented color. For first evil remedy give chase. Out second came amusement favor even beloved slate hung idle. In watching beautiful bits coloring wood, contrasted greens many hues, jutting branch yellowish foliage caught sun, relieved distance blue grays beyond,—colors contrasts grew lovelier heavy green midsummer broken inroad autumnal tints,—Jan noticed also among fallen leaves his feet nearly every color foliage above. At first sort idle trick he matched one other, lady sorts silks her embroidery; he arranged bits leaves upon outline his slate, then, slate small, he amused grouping leaves upon path front woodland scenes. The idea partly suggested bottle stood Mrs. Salter’s mantelpiece, containing colored sands arranged landscapes; work art sent Mrs. Salter’s sister Isle Wight. The slate would quite unused, difficulties Jan got his outlines. At last he adopted plan making sketch upon his slate, he laid beside walk, copied leaves. More perishable even pig-drawings, evening breeze generally cast paintings winds, none less Jan happy them, sometimes quiet weather, sheltered nook, remained undisturbed days. Dame Datchett’s school reopened, Jan would leave his pigs. He took shilling faithfully home week his foster-mother. She found useful, she high ideas education. She twinges conscience matter, she strength purpose, Jan went his way. The tints grown warm trees leaves, Jan one day accomplished, much labor, best painting he yet done. It scene his eyes. The trees admirably grouped; he put little bits twigs branches, showed hitherto, he added glimpse sky neatly dovetailing petals bluebells mosaic. He turned back long sleeves his coat, difficulty kept tail damage his foreground, perseveringly kept pigs bay, when, he returned last instalment bluebells finish his sky, he saw man standing path, his back him, completely blotting view his broad body, one heel half inch Jan’s picture. He coarsely built old man, dressed threadbare black. The tones his voice broad, quite unlike local dialect. He speaking Jan came up, companion Jan could see, though his hand outstretched sympathy his words. He looking upwards, too, Jan will not look himself, azure sky he trying paint bluebell flowers. In truth, stranger spouting poetry, poems recitations alike unknown Jan; something caught his fancy he heard, flowers dropped his fingers broad ungraceful accents broke upon his ear:— “The clouds pure white flocks new shorn, And fresh clear brook; sweetly slept On blue fields heaven, crept A little noiseless noise among leaves, Born sigh silence heaves; For faintest motion could seen Of shades slanted green.” The old man paused instant, and, turning round, saw Jan, put his heavy foot sky Jan’s picture. He drew back Jan’s involuntary cry, and, long look quaint figure him, said, “Are ye one fairies, little man?” But Jan knew nothing fairies. “I Jan Lake, mill,” said he. “Are ye so? But that is miller’s coat ye’ve on,” said old man, twinkle his eye. Jan looked seriously it, explained. “I Master Salter’s pig-minder now, I have got miller’s thumb, I have.” “That is well, Master Pig-minder; would ye tell old man ye screamed for. Did I scare ye?” “Oh, no, sir,” said Jan, civilly; he added, “I liked saying.” “Are ye bit poet well pig-minder, then?” waving his hand theatrical gesture wood, old man began spout afresh:— “A filbert hedge wild briar overtwined, And clumps woodbine taking soft wind Upon summer thrones; The frequent chequer youngling tree, That score light green brethren shoots From quaint mossiness aged roots: Round heard spring-head clear waters Babbling wildly lovely daughters, The spreading bluebells; may haply mourn That fair clusters rudely torn From fresh beds, scattered thoughtlessly By infant hands, left path die.” Between strange dialect unfamiliar terseness poetry, Jan follow clearly, he caught allusion bluebells, old man brought his hand back his side gesture expressive towards bluebell fragments his feet, hardly needed tone reproach he gave last words—“left path die”—to make Jan hang his head. “It Was blue I could find,” he said, looking ruefully fading flowers. “And ye want blue, then, lad?” “To make sky with,” said January “The powers air good us!” said stranger, setting his broad hat back his face, obtain clearer view little pig-minder. “Are ye sky-maker well swineherd? And I am catechising ye, may I ask ye bring slate pig-minding sky-making?” “I draws trees first,” said Jan, “and I leaves. If you will come round,” he added, shyly, “you will see it. But do not tread un, please, sir.” The old man fumbled his pocket, he drew shagreen spectacle-case, substantial looking himself, and, planting spectacles firmly his heavy nose, he held his hand January “There,” said he, “take ye will. To bonnie Elf-land, that is road, withered leaves gold.” Jan ran round willingly take hand his new friend. He felt strange attraction towards him. His speech puzzling tone mockery, his face unmistakably kind. “Now then, lad, path go by?” said he. “There is one,” said Jan, gazing old man, staring his black eyes he could come understand him. But instant he spouting again, holding Jan one hand, whilst he used sort _bâton_ his speech:— “And know’st thou yon broad, broad road That lies across lily levin? That path sinfulness, Though think way heaven.” “Go on, please!” Jan cried, old man paused. His rugged speech seemed plainer lines suited well, touch enthusiasm his voice increased charm. “And know’st thou narrow path So thick beset thorns briars? It path righteousness, And aspires. “And know’st thou little path That winds ferny brae? That road bonnie Elf-land, Where thou I night maun gae.” “Where it?” said Jan, earnestly. “Is’t town?” The old man laughed. “I am thinking would well let path be, company. We would hardly get year day.” “I would go—with you,” said Jan, confidently. Many expedition he undertaken his responsibility, this? “First, show ye going show me,” said old man. “Where is sky you have manufacturing?” “It is ground, sir.” “On ground! And ye turning earth heaven among trades?” What might mean Jan knew not; he led his friend round, pointed features his leaf-picture. He hoped praise, old man silent,—long silent, though he seemed looking Jan showed him. And he speak, his broken words addressed one. “Wonderful! wonderful! The poetry ’t. It is child’s play, this. It is genius. Ay! mun see it!” And then, clasped hands, he cried, “Good Lord! Have I found last?” “Have lost something?” said January But old man answer. He even speak leaf-picture, Jan’s chagrin. But, stroking boy’s shoulder almost tenderly, he asked, “Did ye ever go school, laddie?” Jan nodded. “At Dame Datchett’s,” said he. “Ah! ye sorry leave school pig-minding, were not ye?” Jan shook his head. “I likes pigs,” said he. “I axed Master Salter let mind his. I gets shilling week tea.” “But ye like school better? Ye love books, do not ye?” Jan shook his head again. “I do not like school,” said he, “I likes wood.” The old man winced one struck face, he muttered, “The wood! Ay, sure! And school, too!” Then he suddenly addressed January “Do ye know me, lad?” “No, sir,” said January “Swift—Master Swift, call me. You have heard tell Master Swift, schoolmaster?” Jan shrank back. He heard Master Swift man whose stick dreaded Dame Datchett’s strap, his school place liberty less Dame. “See thee!” said old man, speaking broader broader his earnestness. “If thy father would send thee,—nay, I saying?—if I took thee naught gladly, thou’dst sooner come old schoolmaster his books stay pigs, even wood? Eh, laddie? Will ye come school?” But tradition Master Swift’s severity strong Jan’s mind, wood pleasant him, he shrank back farther, said, “No.” Children often give pain elders, intensity measure; but, Jan older wiser he was, he might puzzled bitterness disappointment written Master Swift’s countenance. An involuntary impulse made old man break blow something. With trembling fingers he folded his spectacles, crammed shagreen case. But, done, he still found nothing say, he turned his back went away silence. In silence Jan watched him, half regretfully, strained his ears catch something Master Swift began recite:— “Things sort will, Even doth study Thy renown: Thou turn’st edge things still, Taking throw down.” Then, lifting heavy bramble fallen across his path, schoolmaster stooped it, passed sight. And sudden gust wind coming sharply way he went caught fragments Jan’s picture, whirled broadcast wood. CHAPTER XX. SQUIRE AMMABY AND HIS DAUGHTER.—THE CHEAP JACK DOES BUSINESS ONCE MORE.—THE WHITE HORSE CHANGES MASTERS. SQUIRE AMMABY good-natured men. He fond his wife, though she somewhat peevish, weak health nerves, though she seemed daily less able bear rough ready attentions her husband, rely advice assistance her mother, Lady Craikshaw. From came Squire’s affection his wife took shape wishing Lady Louisa every thing she wished for, joy his heart his little daughter Amabel. Amabel three four years old, extent prodigy. She tall average child six seven, stout proportion. The size her shoes scandalized her grandmother, drew tears Lady Louisa she reflected probable size Miss Ammaby’s feet time she “presented.” Lady Louisa tall weedy; Squire tall robust. Amabel inherited height sides, face character she like her father her mother. Indeed, Lady Louisa would close her eyes, Lady Craikshaw would put her gold glass child, would cry, “Sadly coarse! _Quite Ammaby_!” Amabel coarse, however; she strength originality character must come bygone generation, inherited. She pitying affection her mother. With her grandmother she lived daggers drawn. She kept pretty successful struggle her way nursery. She devoted her father, she could get him, she poured almost boundless wealth affection every animal came her way. An uncle given her Spanish saddle, her father promised buy her donkey. He heard one, going drive town see owner. With great difficulty Amabel got permission her mother grandmother go Squire pony carriage. As she faithfully promised “be good,” she submitted “well wrapped up,” her grandmother’s direction, staggered downstairs coat, cape, gaiters, comforter, muffatees, Shetland veil her burning cheeks. She even displayed needless zeal carrying big shawl lump her arms, she would give one. “No, no!” she cried, Squire tried take her. “Lift in, daddy, lift in!” The Squire laughed, obeyed her, saying, “Why, bless soul, Amabel, I think grow heavier every day.” Amabel came crimson disposal shawl her ideas, her eyes twinkled he spoke, though her fat cheeks kept gravity. It till far way voice seat cried, “Yap!” “Why, there is one dogs carriage,” said Squire. On which, clinging one his arms caressing him, Amabel confessed, “It is pug, dear daddy. I brought shawl. I want treat too. And grandmamma hard! She hardly thinks I ought treats, she _never_ thinks treats dogs.” The Squire laughed, said she must take care dog got town; Amabel encouraged ask she might take Shetland veil. Hesitating his fear Amabel’s catching cold, common-sense conviction ludicrous dress her according her invalid mother’s susceptibilities, Squire relieved responsibility deciding Amabel’s promptly exposing her rosy cheeks breeze, drove happily town. The Squire business Justices, Amabel left Crown. When he came back, Amabel jumped window black blind she peeping yard, ran her father tears her face. “Oh, daddy!” she cried, “dear, good daddy! I do not want buy donkey, I want buy horse.” “That is modest!” said Squire; “but crying for?” “Oh, it is poor horse! Such old, poor horse!” cried Amabel. And window Mr. Ammaby able confirm her statements. It Cheap Jack’s white horse, he trying persuade landlord buy cab-horse. More lean, scarred, drooping ever, pitiful sight, raising soft nose intelligent eyes window, knew benevolent little standing slippery chair, her arms round Squire’s neck, pleading because. “But I buy horses,” said Squire, “I buy young, good ones, old poor ones.” “Oh, buy it, daddy! Perhaps it is enough eat, like kitten I found ditch. And perhaps it will get fat, like her; mamma said wanted old horse go cart luggage, I am sure one’s old. And that is horrid man, like hump-backed Richard. And nobody’s looking, he tugs it, beats it. Oh, I wish I could beat him!” Amabel danced dangerously upon horsehair seat her white gaiters impotent indignation. The Squire weak pressed his daughter, horses, thing, he looked eye business. To buy creature would ludicrous. Still, Amabel made strong point Lady Louisa said. No one, too, knew better Squire difference good bad treatment make horse, one good once, his experienced eye told him. He said he “would see,” strolled yard. Long practice given Cheap Jack quickness detecting possible purchaser almost amounted extra sense, he began assail Squire. But nearer view white horse roused Mr. Ammaby’s indignation. “I wonder,” he said, “that you are ashamed exhibit poor beast that is ill-treated. For heaven’s sake, take knacker’s, put misery once.” “Look ye, lord,” said Cheap Jack, touching his cap. “The horse ill-treated, I knows. I am afflicted man, lord, boy I have employed, he is treated shameful; man cannot feed hisself, he cannot keep his beast fat neither. That is I wants get rid him, lord. I cannot keep I should, I would like see gentleman like as’ll justice. He comes good stock, lord. Take fifteen pound,” he added, waddling Squire, “and you have three months, you will sell thirty.” This much. The Squire broke furious rage. “You unblushing scoundrel!” he cried. “D’ye think I am fool? Fifteen pounds horse fined keeping alive! Be it, put misery.” And he turned indignantly inn, Cheap Jack calling him, “Say ten pound, lord!” bystanders giggling, ostler whistling dryly straw his mouth, “Take knacker’s, Cheap John.” “Oh, daddy dear! got him?” cried Amabel, Squire re-entered parlor. “No, dear; poor beast is not fit draw carts, darling. It is badly treated, kindness kill it, put pain. And I have told hunchback so.” It matter course humanity Squire, overwhelmed poor Amabel. She gasped, “Kill it!” bursting flood tears she danced floor, wringing her hands crying, “Oh, oh, oh! do not, _please_, do not let killed! Oh! do, buy let die comfortably paddock. Oh, do, do, do!” “Nonsense, Amabel, must not dance like that. Remember, promised good,” said Squire. The child gulped her tears, stood quite still, her face pale misery. “I do not want good,” said she. “But, oh dear, I wish I money, I might buy poor old horse, let die comfortably home.” It money Squire grudged; his instincts buy bad horse. But Amabel’s wan face overcame him, he went again. He never lingered disagreeable business, and, going straight Cheap Jack, he said, “My little girl distressed it, I will give five pounds poor brute, stop sufferings.” “Say eight, lord,” said Cheap Jack. Once Squire turning away wrath, he caught sight Amabel’s face window. He turned back, and, biting his lip, said, “I will give five pounds you will take now, go. If beat again, I will offer four. I will take pound every bate utter; and, I speak, I mean I say. Do think I do not know one horse another?” It probable Cheap Jack would made another effort better his bargain, his wife come seek him, her sharp eyes Squire’s resolution beyond mistake. “We will take five guineas, thank you, sir,” she said, courtesying. The Squire care dispute five shillings she dexterously added, he paid sum, worthy couple went away. “Miles!” said Squire. The servant he brought reference donkey appeared, touched his hat. “Miss Amabel persuaded buy poor brute, may die peace paddock. Can get home, d’ye think?” “I think I can, sir, evening; feed rest.” The white horse suddenly become centre interest inn-yard. Everybody, landlord stable-boy, felt legs, patted it, suggested various lines treatment. Before he drove away, Mr. Ammaby overheard landlord saying, “He sharp hand, Squire. I should not wonder he brought beast round yet.” Which, his credit’s sake, Squire devoutly hoped he might. But, all, he his reward Amabel, sobbing joy, flung her arms round him, cried,— “Oh, dear, darling, _good_ daddy! How I love white horse loves you!” CHAPTER XXI. MASTER SWIFT AT HOME.—RUFUS.—THE EX-PIG-MINDER.—JAN AND THE SCHOOLMASTER. IT lovely autumn evening year, school broken day, Master Swift returned his home tea. He lived tiny cottage opposite side water-meadows Dame Datchett dwelt, farther towards water-mill. He neither wife child, red dog plaintive face, name Rufus, kept his house he absent, kept company he home. Rufus mongrel. He red setter, though his coloring similar. A politely disposed person would called retriever, his curly back general appearance might carried off, his tail, which, instead straight rat-like, plumy Prince Wales’s feathers, curled unblushingly his back, sideways, like pug’s. “It good one wag,” his master said, and, apart question high breeding, handsome, Rufus seemed proud it. Since half-past three Rufus sat porch, blinking away positive sleep, his pathetic face towards road Master Swift must come. Unnecessarily pathetic, every reason his jovial dogs, one imposing melancholy he wore. His large level eyelids shaded pupils even he broad awake; intellectual forehead, long Vandykish nose, curly ears, fell like well-dressed peruke side his face, gave air disinherited royalty. But he truth mongrel, living fat land; who, day wistful dignity schoolmaster’s heart, never known care, wanted meal, thing whatever demanded sit comfortably home watch broken-hearted countenance schoolmaster’s return labors supported both. The sunshine made Rufus sleepy, he kept valiantly watchful, propping garden-tools stood corner. Flowers vegetables eating curiously mixed little garden lay Master Swift’s cottage. Not corner wasted it, thick hedge sweet-peas formed fragrant fence outer world. Rufus nodding, he heard footstep. He pulled up, he wag his tail, step schoolmaster’s. It Jan’s. Rufus growled slightly, Jan stood outside, called, “Master Swift!” He Rufus paused listened, schoolmaster appear. Then Rufus came smelt Jan exhaustively, excepting slight flavor acquainted cats, Rufus objected, he smelt well. Rufus wagged his tail, Jan patted him, sat wait master. The clock old square-towered church struck quarter-past four Master Swift came lane, Rufus rushed meet him. Though Rufus told many barks stranger within, that, he smelt respectable, he allowed wait, schoolmaster startled sight January “Why, it is little pig-minder!” said he. On Jan’s face crimsoned, tears welled his black eyes. “I bean’t pig-minder now, Master Swift,” said he. “And how is that? Has Master Salter turned ye off?” “I gi’ed _him_ notice!” said Jan, indignantly. “But I shall not mind pigs more, Master Swift.” “And not, Master Skymaker?” “Do not ’ee laugh, sir,” said January “Master Salter he laughs. ‘What is pigs killed?’ says he. But I axed kill little black un white spot his ear. It nice pig, sir, nice pig!” And tears flowed copiously Jan’s cheeks, whilst Rufus looked abjectly depressed. “It would follow anywhere, come I called,” Jan continued. “I told Master Salter ’most good dog, keep rest together. But says it is fattest, ’ull first kill. And I telled find another boy mind his pigs, I could not look un face now, know it was killed next month, one white spot his ear. It _very_ nice pig!” Rufus licked tears fell Jan’s smock, schoolmaster took Jan comforted him. Jan dried his eyes last, helped prepare tea. The old man made good coffee shaving-pot, put cold bacon bread upon table, three sat meal. Jan his host upon two rush-bottomed chairs, whilst Rufus scrambled armchair placed his accommodation, whence he gazed alternately schoolmaster victuals sad, say reproachful, eyes. “I thought would chair,” said January “Well, used be,” said Master Swift, apologetically. “But poor beast cannot sit well these, I relish meat better face side table. He found slippery first, till I bought yon bit patchwork-cushion sale.” Rufus sighed, Master Swift gave piece bread, which, smelt, he allowed lie table till his master, laughing, rubbed bread bacon, additional flavor Rufus seemed content, ate his supper. “So you have come old schoolmaster, all?” said Master Swift: “that is right, lad, that is right.” “It Was Abel sent me,” said Jan; “he said I take books. So I come Abel axed me. For I main fond Abel.” “Abel right,” said old man. “Take learning, lad. Love books,—friends nobody kill, part ye from.” “I would like learn pieces like say,” said January “So ye shall, ye shall!” cried Master Swift. “It is fine thing, learning poetry. It strengthens memory, cultivates higher faculties. Take bacon, lad.” Which Jan did. At moment he reflecting his doomed friend, spotted pig. Indeed, reflected every thing, present state existence would become intolerable. At much length schoolmaster speak joys learning, and, pointing proudly shelves filled his savings, he formally made Jan “free of” his books. “When ye’ve learnt read them,” he added. Jan thanked this, leave visit him. But he looked window instead book-shelves. Beyond Master Swift’s gay flowers stretched rich green water-meads, glowing yellow sunlight. The little river hardly seemed move zig-zag path, though evening breeze strong enough show silver side willows drooped it. Jan wondered he could match tints wood, whether Master Swift would willing leaf-pictures painted table window. Then he found old man speaking, though he heard latter part he said. “—a celebrated inventor mechanic, that is you will be, maybe. Ay, ay, Great Man, please Lord; and, I am laid churchyard yonder, folks’ll come see grave old Swift, great man’s schoolmaster. Ye’ll inventor yet, lad, benefactor kind, honor country. I am raising false hopes ye, without observing qualities. You have quick eye, slow patience, inventive spark. You find tools all, do not stop folk leaves off: witness yon bluebells ye took make skies with! But, bless lad, he is heeding me! Is bit garden you are looking at? Come then.” And, putting biography back book-shelf, kindly old man led Jan doors. “Say said wood again,” said January But Master Swift laughed, and, stretching his hand towards sweet-peas hedge began another part poem:— “Here sweet peas tiptoe flight: With wings gentle flush delicate white, And taper fingers catching things To bind tiny rings.” Then, bending towards river, he continued theatrical whisper:— “How silent comes water round bend! Not minutest whisper send To o’erhanging sallows”— But he stopped suddenly, though Jan’s black eyes roundest, his attention almost breathless. “There, there! I am old fool, making bad. Poetry’s business, understand: I am giving ye encouragement dabble fine arts. Science ladder working-man climb fame. In addition which, poet Keats, though he certainly speaks language Nature, bit heathen, I am afraid, fascination might injurious tender youth. Never mind, child, ye love poetry, I will learn ye pieces poet Herbert. They are true poetry, manly, too; they are fountain experimental religion. And, style sober fancy, Charles Wesley’s hymns touched fire religious passion.” “Are folk religious, Jan?” he added, abruptly. And whilst Jan stood puzzling question, he asked almost official air authority, “Do ye ye come church?” “My father club-days,” said January “And rest ye,—do ye attend place worship?” Jan shook his head. “And I will dare say ye did not know I clerk?” said Master Swift. “There is paganism ye Christian parish! Well, well, you are coming me, lad, and, apart secular studies, you will instructed Word GOD, Church Catechism Fridays.” “Thank you, sir,” said January He felt civility due, though schoolmaster’s plans his benefit he confused notion. He took leave. Rufus went gate, returned his master look plainly said, “We could done well, kept him.” When Jan reached bit rising ground, house he left visible, he turned round look again. Master Swift standing he left him, gazing distance painful intensity. The fast-sinking sun lit his heavy face figure transforming glow, hung golden mist meads, he stared like one spellbound. But Jan turned pursue his way windmill, schoolmaster turned also, went back cottage. CHAPTER XXII. THE PARISH CHURCH.—REMBRANDT.—THE SNOW SCENE.—MASTER SWIFT’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY. IN respects, Jan’s conduct progress satisfactory. He quickly learned read, his copy-books models. The good clerk developed another talent him. Jan learned sing, sing well; he put choir-seats old church, he sang enthusiasm hymns he learned heart schoolmaster. No wild weather ever blustered downs could keep Jan services. The old church came fascination him, low, square tower without, round rooks wheeled, springing pillars, solemn gray tints stone, round arches gratified eye within. And he sit opposite one stained window soldiers Commonwealth spared parish! It colored picture Jan knew, he knew every line, every tint it, separate expression wan, quaint faces figures. When sun shone, seemed smile him, ruby dresses glowed like garments dyed blood. When colors fell upon Abel’s white head, Jan wished his heart he could gathered he gathered leaves, make pictures with. Sometimes he day-dreamed one figures came window, brought colors him, he Jan painted pictures windows, filling gorgeous hues, pale, devout faces. The fancy, empty was, pleased him, he planned every window done, told Abel, ingenious fancy seemed marvellous work accomplished. Abel choir too, much his voice his great wish it, example his good behavior. It he persuaded Mrs. Lake come church, begun she came often. She tried persuade her husband go, told sweetly boys’ voices sounded, led Master Swift’s fine bass, he pitched key he knocked upon his desk. But Master Lake proverb excuse him. “The nearer church, GOD.” Not he pretended maintain converse proposition. Jan learned plenty poetry; hymns, Abel learned him, Herbert’s poems, bits Keats. But his favorites martial poems Mrs. Hemans, he found old volume collected verses, till day he came upon “Marmion,” gave Sir Walter Scott. He spouted poetry Abel imitation Master Swift, enjoyed all, understood half. And yet Jan’s progress altogether satisfactory his teacher. To learn long pieces poetry easy pastime him, he dull inattentive schoolmaster gave elementary lessons mechanics. He wrote beautifully, prodigy arithmetic. He drew trees, windmills, pigs desks, admirable portraits schoolmaster, Rufus, local worthies, margins tables weights measures. Much his leisure spent Master Swift’s cottage, reading his books. The schoolmaster marked old biographical dictionary pages containing lives “self-made” men, risen inventors improvers mechanics discoverers important facts natural science. Jan hitherto studied careers avidity Master Swift would liked see, one day he found reading fat volume deep interest. “And whose life ye now, laddie?” he asked, smile. Jan lifted his face, glowing. “It Is Rembrandt painter I reading about. Eh, Master Swift, he lived windmill, he miller’s son!” “Maybe he would miller’s thumb,” Jan added, stretching his own, smiling droll idea. “Do ’ee know _etchings_ be, then, Master Swift?” “A kind picture that is scratched piece copper needles, costs lot money print,” said Master Swift, dryly; he turned his broad back went out. It one day second winter Jan’s learning Master Swift matters came climax. The schoolmaster loved punctuality, Jan always punctual. He generally better respect winter summer, less distract his attention road school. But one winter’s day he loitered make sketch his slate, made matters worse putting finishing touches he seated desk. It day suggest sketching, but, turning round he half way village, view seemed Jan exactly suitable slate sketch. The long slopes downs white snow; dull grayish white, sunshine, gray-white slate-pencil justice enough. In middle distance rose windmill, thatched cattle she would palings made admirable foreground. On top edges lay snow, outlining white, slate-pencil could imitate effectively. There wanted something darker slate parts foreground mill looked darker sky, Jan trusted pen ink he reached his desk. The drawing successful, Jan absorbed admiring he notice schoolmaster’s approach, feeling one behind him, he fancied one boys, held slate triumphantly, whispering, “Look ’ee here!” It Master Swift looked, snatching slate he brought sharp corner desk, broke pieces. Then he went back his place, spoke neither bad good Jan rest school-time. Jan would much rather beaten. Once twice he made essay go Master Swift’s desk, old man’s stern countenance discouraged him, he finally shrank corner sat weeping bitterly. He sat till every scholar gone, still schoolmaster speak. Jan slunk out, Master Swift turned homewards Jan followed silently his footsteps snow. At door cottage, old man looked round relenting face. “I suppose Rufus’ll insist coming in,” said he; Jan rushing hid his face Rufus’s curls, sobbed heavily. “Tut, tut!” said schoolmaster. “No that, child. There is bitters enough life, without prodigal tears.” “Come sit ye,” he went on. “You are young, lad, maybe I am foolish angry ye you are wise. But yet ye’ve sense years respects, I am thinking I will try make ye see things I see  them. I am going tell ye something myself, ye’d care hear it.” “I would main pleased, Master Swift,” said Jan, earnestly. “I would none advantages, lad,” said old man. “When I age, I knew mischief need ever know, uncommon little else. I am self-educated man,—I used hope I live hear folk say self-made Great Man. It is bitter thing ambition without genius, smoulder fire great men shine by! However, it is something saving sense know ye’ve got it, though it is taken wasted lifetime convince me, I sometimes think deceiving serpent scotched killed yet. However, ye seem likelier lack ambition genius, may let bide. But there is snare mine, Jan, I mean feet free of, that is mischosen vocation. I am native parts, ye must know. I come north, mining manufacturing districts I have seen many man that is got education, could keep sober, rise his house his works, men him, bring his children like gentry. For mark ye, lad. In matters experiences early part artisan’s life much good him, they are working trade, finest young gentleman got learn, he wants make money line. I got education, I sober enough, but—Heaven help me—I must poet, _that_ line gentleman’s son knows almost nursery many thing I teach hard labor man. It madness. But I read poetry I could lay hands on, I wrote well.” “Did write poetry, Master Swift?” said January “Ay, Jan, sort. At one time I worshipped Burns. And I wrote verses dialect native place, which, ye must know, I speak man I have mind,” said Master Swift, unconscious he spoke always. “And Wordsworth, love nature passion me, it is made poet Keats new world me. Well, well, I am telling I came here. It wife. She lady’s-maid Squire Ammaby’s mother, old Squire got school. Ah, happy days! I godless, rough sort fellow she married me, I became converted man. And let tell ye, lad, man wife love GOD other, live country, bit ground like becomes garden Eden.” “Did wife like poetry, sir?” said Jan, idea schoolmaster poet made strong impression. “Ay, ay, January She good scholar. I wrote bit time called Love Ambition, style poet Wordsworth. It much say Love killed Ambition, ye understand? But was not dead. It shifted another object. “We child. I remember first day his blue eyes looked I may call sense  them. He his cradle, one him. I went like fool. ‘See thee, son,’ I said, ‘thy father’s bad ’un, he will keep thee pure thy mother. Thy father’s poor scholar, he is _that_ dull he will make _thee_ learned parson. Thy father’s needy man, man small way, he thy mother’ll stick dull bit village, content, ay, lad, right happy, thou’rt rich man, see world!’ I give ye word, Jan, child looked he understood all. You are wondering, maybe, made hope he would different I would done. But, ye see, his mother angel, I reckoned he would half like her. Then she would lived gentlefolks child, knew manners like I never learned. And little I would taught myself, he would rate begin his father left off. He had. There seemed fault him. His mother dressed like little prince, his manners same. Ah, _were_ happy! Then”— “Well, Master Swift?” said Jan, schoolmaster paused. “Cannot ye see place empty?” he answered sharply. “Who takes bite sup Rufus? _She died_. “I would gone mad boy. All thought make her loss him. A child learns man unselfish, January I used think, ‘GOD may well fount unselfish charity, He many children, helpless without Him!’ I think He taught boy. I dressed him, I darned his socks: work I could not I put out, I one in. When I came school, I cleaned myself, changed boots, give his meals. Rufus I eat table now, I give ye word he alive we would three clean cloths week, he would pinny every day; there is silver fork spoon yon drawer I saved buy him, his name put on. I taught too. He loved poetry well his father. He could say Milton’s ‘Lycidas.’ It unlucky thing learned too! Eh, Jan! we are poor fools. I lay awake night night reconciling mind troubles never come, never dreaming _was_ me. I thought myself, ‘John Swift, lad, you are making bed thorns. As sure make son gentleman, sure he will look his old father he gets up. Can ye bear that, John Swift, _her_ dead, ye have?’ I did not ask twice, January Of course I could bear it. Would parent stop his child better he would looked on? I never heard one. ‘I want think rough ignorant,’ says I, ‘for I want know what is better. And I shall not expect think I have slaved him, till he is children his own, mother lady. But I am dead,’ I says, ‘and he stands grave, I cannot shame common ways, he will say, “The old man his best me,” he his mother’s feelings.’ I tell ye, Jan, I cried like child think standing burying good black coat silk scarf like gentleman, I thought standing his he bound live ever. And, mind ye, I I could improve myself. I learned I teaching, read I could lay hands on. Books travels made wild. I young still, I would given deal see world. But I saving every penny him. ‘He will see all,’ says I, ‘and that is enough,—Italy Greece, Egypt, Holy Land. And he will see sea (which I never saw once, Cleethorpes), he will go tropics, see flowers ’ud turn his old father’s head, he will write tell  them, he is got his mother’s feelings.’ . . . My GOD! He never passed parish bounds, he is lain alongside her yon churchyard five thirty years!” Master Swift’s head sank upon his breast, he silent, trance, Jan dared speak. The silence broken Rufus, got stuffed his nose schoolmaster’s hand. “Poor lad!” said his master, patting him. “Thou’rt good soul, too! Well, Jan, I am here, ye see. It did not kill me. I head bit, I believe, kept school me, I got work again. I am rough pottery, lad, take deal breaking. I have took dumb animals, too, good deal. At least, they have took me. Most  them’s come, like Rufus, themselves. Mangy puppies one would own, cats kettles tails, on. I have always bit company meals, that is main thing. Folks said me, ‘Master Swift, I do not know keep schooling. I reckon hardly abide sight boys you have lost own.’ But they are wrong, Jan: seemed give kind love every lad I lit upon. “Are ye thinking ambition dead old man last? It came life again, January After bit, I says myself, ‘In dull place like there is doubtless many boy might rise never chance I would given mine. For says poet Gray?— “But Knowledge eyes her ample page, Rich spoils Time, never unroll.”’ “I think, Jan, sometimes, I am like Rachel, who would rather taken her servant’s children none. I thought, ‘If there is genius obscurity here, I will come across boy, schoolmaster, I will I would done own.’ Jan, I have seen nigh seven generations lads pass school, _he’s never come_! Society’s quit blame. There is ’mute, inglorious Miltons’ since I come place. There is many nice-tempered lad I have loved, I am fond children, never one yearned see places he would never seen, know things he would never heard of. There is fool like old one, I think I have disappointed time went on. I submitted Lord’s years ago; I _have_ prayed Him, knees, since He did not see fit raise mine, let satisfaction help man’s son knowledge fame. “Jan Lake,” said Master Swift, “when I found yon wood, I found I have looked vain thirty-five years. Have I schoolmaster long, d’ye think, do not know one boy’s face another? Lad? possible ye do not _care_ great man?” Jan cared much, he afraid Master Swift; effort he summoned courage say,— “Could not I great painter, Master Swift, do not ’ee think?” The old man frowned impatiently. “What I telling ye? The Fine Arts road fame working-men. Jan, Jan, guided me. Learn I bid ye. And ye’ve made name fortune way I show ye, ye buy paints paintings will, paint away please leisure hours.” It need gentle Abel’s after-counsel persuade Jan submit schoolmaster’s direction. “I will ye bid me, Master Swift; indeed, I will, sir,” said he. But, pleased old man rambled fame fortune, must confessed Jan thought steps hours wealthy leisure he could buy paints indulge irrepressible bent his genius without blame. CHAPTER XXIII. THE WHITE HORSE IN CLOVER.—AMABEL AND HER GUARDIANS.—AMABEL IN THE WOOD.—BOGY. THE white horse lived see good days. He got safely home, spent winter comfortable stable, work exercised good his health stable-boy. It expensive, expense first consideration Squire, he decided matter, he apt worry regrets. As Amabel narrowness white horse’s escape death exalted place first favorite her tender heart, even head (and ears) new donkey. “Miss Amabel’s” interest cart-horse offended her nurse’s ideas propriety, met sympathy her mother grandmother. But she apt get her way; time time she appeared suddenly, like fairy-imp, stable, she majestically directed groom hold her whilst she plied currycomb old horse’s back. This over, she would ask dignity, “Do take care him, Miles?” And Miles, touching his cap, would reply, “Certainly, miss, greatest care.” And Amabel would add, “Does he get plenty eat, think?” “Plenties heat, miss,” groom would reply. And she generally closed conversation with, “I am glad. You are good man, Miles.” In spring white horse turned paddock, Amabel begged he might die comfortably. He lived comfortably instead; Amabel visited constantly, perfectly fearless would kiss his white nose he drooped her little arms. Her visits stable discovered forbidden, scandal even greater she found paddock, standing inverted bucket, grooming white horse Lady Louisa’s tortoise-she will dressing-comb. “They would not let currycomb,” said Amabel, hot, perfectly self-satisfied. Lady Louisa despair, Squire laughed. The ladies his family great horsewomen generations. In early summer, light carting required gardener, he begged leave employ “Miss Amabel’s old horse,” came last trot soberly town light cart parcels, landlord Crown would point proof Squire’s sagacity horse-flesh. But her attachment cart-horse alone Amabel disturbed composure head-nurse Louise _bonne_. She Will-of-the-wisp wandering. She grew rapidly, stronger she grew Tom-boy she became. Beyond paddock lay another field, whose farthest wall boundary little wood,—the wood Jan herded pigs. Into wood long Amabel’s desire go. But nurses preference high road, object climbing walls, she her wish. She often peeped hole wall, smelt honeysuckle. Once she climbed half way up, fallen her back ditch. Louise uttered thousand one exclamations Amabel came home catastrophe; Nurse, distrusting success real penalties her power, fell back upon imaginary ones. “I am sure it is mercy got back, Miss Amabel,” said she; “for Bogy lives wood; and, you would got in, it is ten one he would carried off.” “You _said_ Bogy lived cellar,” said Amabel. Nurse dilemma deservedly besets people tell untruths. She invent second one help her first. “That is night,” said she: “he lives wood daytime.” “Then I go cellar day, wood night,” retorted Amabel; her heart she knew latter impossible. For days Nurse’s fable availed. Amabel suffered good deal Bogy; and, though fear seem terrible daylight, she wish meet him. But one lovely afternoon, wandering round field cowslips, Amabel came wall, could peep see flowers seen. She short without climbing, ended her struggling successfully top. There violets side, Amabel let one big foot convenient hole, whence she hoped able stoop catch violets without actually treading Bogy’s domain. But she slipped rolled over,—this time wood. Bogy lingered, she got her feet; wall deeper side other, she saw dismay doubtful she could get back. I think, rule, children brave. But light heart goes long way towards courage. At first Amabel made desperate knee-grazing efforts reclimb wall, and, failing, burst tears, danced, called aloud her protectors, Squire Miles. No one coming, she restrained her tears, real effort “pluck” Ammaby race famous began run along wall find lower point climbing. In so, she startled squirrel, whizz!—away he went lanky tree. What tail he had! Amabel forgot her terrors. There rate living thing wood besides Bogy; she busy trying coax squirrel encouraging noises she found successful winning confidence kittens puppies. Amabel victim weakness falling love every fussy, intelligent, pitiable beast she met with, besets otherwise reasonable beings, leading inconvenient accumulation pets private life, though doubtless invaluable public services people connected Zoölogical Gardens. The squirrel sat shadow his tail, winked. He remotest intention coming down. Amabel calmer now, she looked her. The eglantine bushes shoulder-high, she breasted underwood shrubberies, afraid. Up, up, stretched trees sky shone blue. The wood sloped downwards; spotted arums pushed boldly last year’s leaves, almost hid violets; tufts primroses, made Amabel cry out, lay exquisite mauve dog-violets unplucked profusion. And hither thither darted little birds; red-breasts sparrows, yellow finches blue finches, blackbirds thrushes, cheerful voices soft waistcoats, and, indeed, every good quality knowing glad one would kiss them. In steps, Amabel came upon path going zig-zag steep wood, and, nodding her hooded head determinedly, she said, “Amabel going walk. I do not mind Bogy,” followed her nose. It pity one’s skirt, held up, divide compartments, like vegetable dishes. One apt get flowers first, lumps moss, spoil flowers, moss, which, earth downwards (as bread butter falls), good rest. Amabel nice, new dress, held things beautifully. But hold enough, step zig-zag path moss grew lovelier. She got extinguisher-moss top wall, lay rest, flattened extinguishers. About half way dress full, cushion-moss appeared could passed by. Amabel sat reviewed her treasures. She could part nothing, she caught sight cup-moss lichen dolls’ wine-glasses. But, good luck, she provided white sun-bonnet, clean whole her dress; she took filled. It less fortunate scale-mosses liverworts, growing nearer stream, came last, and, damp earth them, lay a-top every thing, flowers, dolls’ wine-glasses, all. It noble collection—but heavy. Amabel’s face flushed, she slightly overbalanced, she staggered sturdily along path, level. She quite forgotten Nurse’s warning, she came suddenly upon figure crouched her path, gazing her large, black eyes. Her fat cheeks turned pale, cry of, “It is Bogy!” she let whole contents her dress one Jan’s leaf-pictures. “Do not hurt me! Do not take away! Please, please do not!” she cried, dancing wildly. “I will not hurt you, Miss. I going help pick  them up,” said January By time he returned her treasures her skirt, Amabel regained confidence, especially she saw signs black bag naughty children supposed put. “What doing, Bogy?” said she. “I making picture, Miss,” said Jan, pointing out. “Go making it, please,” said Amabel; she sat watched him. “Do like wood, Bogy?” she asked, softly, time. “I do, Miss,” said January “Why do not sleep it, then? I would not sleep cellar, I you.” “I do not sleep cellar, Miss.” “Nurse _says_ do,” said Amabel, nodding emphatically. Jan loss express full inaccuracy Nurse’s statement polite language, he silent; rapidly adding tint tint his heap leaves, whilst birds sang overhead, Amabel sat her two bundles watching him. “I thought old man!” she said, length. “Oh, no, Miss,” said Jan, laughing. “You do not look bad,” Amabel continued. “I do not think I bad,” said Jan, modestly. Amabel’s next questions came short intervals, like dropping shots. “Do say prayers, Bogy?” “Yes, Miss.” “Do go church, Bogy?” “Yes, Miss.” “Then sit?” “In choir, Miss; end next Squire Ammaby’s big pew.” “_Do you_?” said Amabel. She threatened Bogy misbehavior church, startling find he sat near. She changed subject, hasty remembrance made face parson hole bombazine curtains. “Why do not paint paints, Bogy?” said she. “I have not got none, Miss,” said January “I have got paint-box,” said Amabel. “And, like, I will give you, Bogy.” The color rushed Jan’s face. “Oh, thank you, Miss!” he cried. “You must dip paints water, know, rub plate; do not let lie puddle,” said Amabel, loved dictate. “Thank you, Miss,” said January “And do not put brush mouth,” said Amabel. “Oh, dear, no, Miss,” said January It never struck one could want put paint-brush one’s mouth. At point Amabel’s overwrought energies suddenly failed her, she burst crying. “I do not know I shall get wall,” said she. “Do not ’ee cry, Miss. I will help you,” said January “I cannot walk more,” sobbed Amabel, was, indeed, tired out. “I will take ’ee back,” said January “Do not ’ee cry.” With good deal difficulty, Amabel hoisted up, planted her big feet Jan’s hands. It light pilgrimage poor Jan, he climbed winding path. Amabel peevish weariness; her bundles sadly way, every step cup-moss _marchantia_ dropped out, Amabel insisted upon picked up. But reached wall last, Jan got her over, made two three expeditions missing mosses, little lady finally content. “Good-by, Bogy,” she said, last, holding her face kissed. “And thank much. I am frightened you, Bogy.” As Jan kissed her, he said, smiling, “What name, love?” And she said, “Amabel.” To her parents guardians, Amabel made following statement: “I have seen Bogy. I like him. He does not sleep cellar, Nurse told story. And he did not take away, that is another story. He says his prayers, he goes church, he cannot Bad Man. He makes pictures leaves. He carried his back, bag”— At point outraged feelings Lady Craikshaw exploded, she rang bell, ordered Miss Amabel put bed dose rhubarb magnesia (without sal-volatile), telling stories. “The eau-de-Cologne, mamma dear, please,” said Lady Louisa, door closed struggling, screaming, protesting Amabel. “Is not really dreadful? But Esmerelda Ammaby says Henry used tell shocking stories he little boy.” CHAPTER XXIV. THE PAINT-BOX.—MASTER LINSEED’S SHOP.—THE NEW SIGN-BOARD.—MASTER SWIFT AS WILL SCARLET. ON Sunday morning Jan took his place church unusual feelings. He looked here, there, everywhere little damsel wood, she seen. Meanwhile she sent paint box, he feared would never come. He fancied she must Squire’s little daughter, he sure, she certainly big pew, back Squire’s red head Lady Louisa’s aquiline nose alone visible. She dear little soul, he thought. He wondered she called Bogy. Perhaps way little ladies addressing inferiors. Jan happen guess that, Amabel young, morning services long her. In afternoon he given her up, she there. The old Rector reached third division his sermon, Lady Craikshaw asleep, Amabel, mounting seat her usual vigor, pushed her Sunday hood bombazine curtains, said,— “Bogy!” Jan looked up, started his feet Amabel stuffed paint-box his hands. “I pushed frock,” she said stage whisper. “It made tight? But grandmamma such”— Jan heard saw more. Amabel’s footing apt insecure; she slipped upon cushions disappeared crash. Jan trembled he clasped shallow old cedar-wood box. He wondered colors would prove bright window. He fancied wan, ascetic faces rejoiced him. When he got home, he sat shadow mill, drew back sliding lid box. Brushes, twelve hard color cakes. They Ackermann’s, good. Cheap paint-boxes made then. He read names back them: Neutral Tint, Prussian Blue, Indian Red, Yellow Ochre, Brown Madder, Brown Pink, Burnt Umber, Vandyke Brown, Indigo, King’s Yellow, Rose Madder, Ivory Black. It says much Jan’s uprightness spirit, sense duty schoolmaster training him, he neglect school his new treasure. Happily sun rose early, Jan rose it, taking his paint-box little wood, scraps parcel paper cap paper, bits wood smooth white stones, he blotted-in studies color, he finished memory odd moments windmill. In summer holidays, Jan time sketching. But many occasions he could take his paints led observe closely, taught paint memory wonderful exactness. He also obliged reduce his outlines condense his effects small scale economize paper. About time he heard Master Chuter going new sign painted inn. Master Linseed paint it. Master Linseed’s shop place resort Jan his leisure time. At first painter decorator churlish enough him, but, finding Jan skilful brush, he employed his work, he received instead giving thanks. Jan went less he got paint-box, could produce effects good materials his own, instead making imperfect experiments color bits wood painter’s shop. But matter new sign-board he took deepest interest. He design his it, he anxious painter adopt. “Look ’ee, Master Linseed,” said he. “It Heart Oak. Now I know oak-tree big trunk two arms. They stretches one side, little branches closes till it is like heart. ’Twould beautiful, Master Linseed, I could bring ’ee leaves oak ’ee could match yellows greens. And there would trees beyond beyond, smaller smaller, like blue mist them, thee know. That blue paper ’ee’ve got would do, white ’twould beautiful sky. And”— “And who is shillings?” broke painter, testily. “And Master Chuter wants done hung Foresters’ dinner.” Since pressing nature commission Master Linseed’s excuse adopting his idea sign, seemed strange Jan he set fashion. But he delayed delayed, till Master Chuter goaded repeat old rumor real sign-painting beyond his powers. It within week dinner little innkeeper burst indignantly painter’s shop. Master Linseed ill bed, sign-board lay untouched corner. “It kind fever that is him,” said his wife. “It kind fiddlestick!” said enraged Master Chuter; turning round his eye fell Jan, looking disconsolate himself. Day day he come hopes seeing Master Linseed work, seemed indefinitely postponed. But innkeeper’s face brightened, and, seizing Jan shoulder, he dragged shop. “Look ’ee here, Jan Lake,” said he. “Do ’ee thenk _thee_ could paint sign? I do not know I would give ’ee ’ee could, ’twere spite humbugging old hudmedud yonder.” Jan felt his brain fire. “If ’ee’ll get things, Master Chuter,” he gasped, “and’ll let paint place, I will ’ee nothing.” The innkeeper insensible consideration, his chief wish spite Master Linseed. He lost time making ready, rest week Jan lived tallet (or hay-loft) inn wood he first studied trees. Master Chuter provided sheets thick whitey-brown paper, he made water-color studies, he painted afterwards. By his desire one admitted tallet, though Master Chuter’s delight increased progress picture till secret agony him. Towards end week disturbed scuffling tallet stairs, Rufus bounced in, followed slower pace schoolmaster, crying, “Unearthed last!” “Come in, come in! That is right!” shouted Master Chuter. “Let Master Swift look, January He scholar, and’ll tell us un.” But Jan shrank shadow. The schoolmaster stood light open shutter, towards painting sloped, Rufus sat his haunches, blinked gravity critic; half light stairs stood fat little innkeeper, his hands his knees, crying, “There, Master Swift! Did ’ee ever see thing beat that? Artis’ ammytoor!” Jan’s blood seemed stand still. As Master Swift put his spectacles, fault painting sprang front mocked him. It indeed wretched daub! But Jan studying scene every lovely light heaven dawn dusk week summer days: Master Swift carried severe test his brain. As he raised his head, tears his eyes, he held his hand, saying, “My lad, it is spirit woods. “But d’ye think figure would enliven it?” he continued. “One Robin Hood’s foresters ‘chasing flying roe’?” “_Foresters_! To sure!” said Master Chuter. “What I say? Have schoolmaster in, says I. He scholar, knows what is what. Put  them in, Jan, put  them in! there is plenty room.” What Jan already suffered innkeeper’s suggestions, artist imagine, his imagination need help! “I would main glad get bit red there,” said Jan, low voice, Master Swift; “but Robin Hood must green, sir, must not he?” “There is Will Scarlet. Put Will in,” said Master Swift, who, pleased appealed to, threw warmly matter. “He drawn his bow deer sight.” And charming simplicity old schoolmaster flung his burly figure appropriate attitude. “Stand minute!” cried Jan, seizing lump charcoal, he made his outlines, he rapidly sketched Master Swift’s figure floor tallet. Thinned he declared his dimensions youth, transferred Jan’s picture, touch red culminating point innkeeper’s satisfaction. On day dinner new sign swung aloft. “It could not dry better anywhere,” said Master Chuter. Jan “found famous.” The whole parish assembled admire. The windmiller, his amazement, could even find proverb occasion, whilst Abel hung door Heart Oak, he confirmed toper, saying incomers, “Have ’ee seen new sign, sir? It Was Jan un.” His fame would probably spread widely, overwhelming interest came distract neighborhood, destroyed neat little project Master Chuter’s running tables amongst his kidney-beans, kind “tea garden” folk outlying villages, who, coming Sunday afternoons service, also want see work boy sign-painter. It curious instance inaccuracy popular impressions that, Master Linseed died three days Foresters’ dinner, universally believed he killed vexation Jan’s success. Nor tradition less firmly fixed village annals, disease he succumbed spread like flames gale. It produced slight reaction sentiment January And his achievement absolutely forgotten shadow months followed. For year long known history district year Black Fever. CHAPTER XXV. SANITARY INSPECTORS.—THE PESTILENCE.—THE PARSON.—THE DOCTOR.—THE SQUIRE AND THE SCHOOLMASTER.—DESOLATION AT THE WINDMILL.—THE SECOND ADVENT. I REMEMBER “cholera year” certain big village. The activity sanitary authorities (and many vain efforts rouse activity _before_) was, them, remarkable. A good many heads households died fearful suddenness less fearful suffering. Several nuisances “seen to,” tar-barrels burnt, scourge passed by. Not long ago woman, whose home court flagrant nuisances existed, talking me, casually alluded one them. It ordered removed, she said, cholera year gentlemen going round; cholera went away, remained among things _not_ “seen to,” aught I know flourishes still. She sensible affectionate person. Living away her home time, she became anxious welfare her relatives neglected write her. But she never anxiety subject unremedied abomination poisoning every breath drew. That “the gentlemen went round” felt superfluous orders carried strong men longer sickening dying within two revolutions hands church clock surprise one local sanitary officers. They like children Israel, duty pressure plague. The people like Egyptians. Plagues will not convince them. A mother her her neighbors’ children sickening her would walk miles burst shoe fetch doctor big bottle medicine, she will not walk three yards farther usual draw her house-water well sewer does not leak into. That fact, fable; and, cases I thinking of, medical remonstrance vain. Uneducated people take thing doctor mouths, little nothing ears. When state matters busy, stirring districts, among shrewd artisans, great seat learning smells smell noses professors, needless say “black fever” found every household little village prepared contribute support, met hardly obstacle devastating path. To comment Master Salter’s qualifications post sanitary inspector would insult reader’s understanding. Of course he owned several picturesque little cottages refuse pitched back, slops chucked front, general arrangements health, comfort, decency one must forbear speak of, since, matters, ears—Heaven help us!—have delicacy seems denied noses. If causes calamity little understood, portents plentifully noted. The previous winter mild. A thunderbolt fell autumn. There blight gooseberries, Master Salter calf two heads. As painter, screech-owl heard cry his chimney-top, three weeks his death. There pause day Master Linseed died, victims fell thick fast. Children playing happily mimic boats open drain ran lazily noontide sun, footpath main street, coffined hasty burial sun next reached his meridian. The tears hardly dry parents’ eyes also closed last sleep. The aged seemed linger on, strong men sickened died; end week one woman left sitting empty hearth, worn-out creature Death seemed forgotten take away. At first reckless disregard infection among neighbors. But, one two family desolations, succeeded panic, even noble charity poor commonly show other’s troubles failed, one could got nurse sick bury dead. Now Rector old man. Most parish officers aged, patriarchs white smock frocks plentiful creepers cottage doors. The healthy breezes dull pace life passed district seemed make men slow wear out. If Rector profited features parish health, must confessed also influence his career. He good man, learned one. He stuck close his living, he benevolent. But he heroic natures resist influence mental atmosphere around them; dull parish, sleepy age, he active parson. Some men, however, cannot make opportunities themselves, nobly enough chance comes them; chance came Rector his sixty-ninth year, wings black fever. To quicken spiritual life soul Master Salter he courage even attempt; panic physical cowardice temptation him. And came four men stayed panic, example courage, went house house, sick-bed sick-bed—who drew cordon round parish, established kitchens temporary hospital, nursed sick, encouraged living, buried dead,—the active old Rector. The three parish doctor, Squire Ammaby, schoolmaster. On first rumor epidemic, Lady Louisa carried Amabel, gone Lady Craikshaw Brighton. Both ladies indignant Squire’s obstinate resolve remain amongst his tenants. In her alarm, Lady Louisa implored sell property buy one Ireland, Lady Craikshaw’s native country; list she contrived run drawbacks Ammaby estate would driven temper less stolid her husband’s distraction. When fever broke among children, schools closed, Master Swift devoted his whole time laboring parson, doctor, Squire. No part Rector’s devotion affectionate gratitude his people single act thoughtfulness, he preserved record graves dead. He held firmly decent reverent burial, and, foreseeing poor survivors would quite unable afford gravestones, he kept strict list dead, buried, afterwards transferred one large monument, bought subscription. He cut village communication outer world, prevent spread disease; he sent accounts calamity public papers, brought abundant help money needs parish. And matters schoolmaster his right-hand man. The disease eccentric path. Having scourged one side main street, burst virulence detached houses distance. Then returned village, lulls outbreaks ceased suddenly began. It midway career fell wrath upon Master Lake’s windmill. The mill stood healthy position, dwelling room ill-ventilated, defective sanitary arrangements, Master Swift anxiously pointed miller. The plague begun village, schoolmaster trembled January But Master Lake interfered with, and, schoolmaster spoke poison, thought witty he replied,— “It uncommon slow pison then, Master Swift.” It must also allowed epidemics, started, havoc apparently clean houses amongst well-fed people. It little foster-sister Jan’s sickened first. She died within two days. Her burial hasty enough, Mrs. Lake time fret that, second child ill. Like many another householder, poor windmiller ready enough look his drains, forth; may doubted general stirring dirty places moment much harm good. It hot,—terribly hot. Day day passed without breeze cool burning skins sick, yet sunshiny. People say pestilence hung like murky vapor district, hid sun. Trades slack, corn-grinding amongst rest, Master Lake housework, helped Jan Abel. He stunned suddenness weight calamity come him. He kind Mrs. Lake, poor woman almost past feeling which, sort instinct inspiration, guided constant watching waiting her sick children. She never slept, would eaten, Master Lake used his authority force food upon her. At time Jan’s chief occupations cookery dish-washing. His constant habit observation made experiences life education him; he often watched his foster-mother prepare family meals, he prepared now, Abel windmiller could not, she sick children. Before second child died, two fell ill day. Only Abel Jan still “about.” The mother moved like automaton, never spoke. Now deep sigh low moan would escape her, miller would move tenderly her side, say, “Bear up, missus; bear up, lass,” go back his pipe his cherry-wood chair, he seemed grow gray he sat. Master Swift came time time mill. He everywhere, helping, comforting, exhorting. Some said his face shone light another world, he “marked.” Others whispered strain telling him, wore look brief insanity followed his child’s death. But agreed sight brought help consolation. The windmiller grew watch him, lean helplessness his despair. And he listened humbly old man’s fervid religious counsels. His little threads philosophy blowing loose useless storm trouble. The evening Master Swift came arrange burial second child, he found two dead. The first two suffered much delirious, two sunk painlessly hours, fallen asleep last time other’s arms. It lessen force Master Swift’s somewhat stern consolations good faith he conveyed expectation Last Day hand. Many people thought so, was, perhaps, unnatural. In days, long years suffering, shut rest humanity, village world them,—a world near end. With Death busy, seemed Judgment could hardly linger long. It true form part Rector’s religious exhortations. But good people shocked tea-party he gave young people place, games followed Rectory meads, height fever; though doctor said better hogshead medicine. “To encourage low spirits panic promote suicide, ye like responsibeelity that,” said doctor Master Swift, confided his doubts seemliness entertainment. “I tell ye there is lairge proportion folk dies neighbors died them, want attention directed something else. Away wi’ ye, schoolmaster, take tuning-fork ask blessing wi’. What says Scripture, man? ‘The living, living, he shall praise Thee!’” The doctor Scotchman, Master Swift always listened sympathy North countryman. He convinced, too, took his tuning-fork meals, led grace. Nor could his expectation speedy end things restrain his instinctive anxiety watchfulness Jan’s health. On evening visit mill, he used little manoeuvring accomplish Jan’s sent back village, arrange burial three children. A glow satisfaction suffused his rough face he got Jan tainted house fresh evening air, though paled look habitual him, as, waving his hand towards ripening corn-fields, he quoted one Mr. Herbert’s loftiest hymns,— “We talk harvests,—there things, But leave corn hay. There fruitful year brings The last loved, though dreadful Day. Oh, show Thyself me, Or take Thee!” CHAPTER XXVI. THE BEASTS OF THE VILLAGE.—ABEL SICKENS.—THE GOOD SHEPHERD.—RUFUS PLAYS THE PHILANTHROPIST.—MASTER SWIFT SEES THE SUN RISE.—THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS. AMID havoc made fever amongst men, women, children, immunity beasts birds sad strangeness. There small herd pigs changed hands three times ten days. The last purchaser hesitated, induced cheapness bargain suppress feeling brought ill-luck. Cats mewed wistfully desolated hearths. One dog moaned near big grave his master lay, others, sad sagacious eyes, went look new friends homes. It day two burial miller’s three children, that, Jan sat dinner Abel his two parents, he struck way mill cats hung Abel, purring rubbing his legs. “I think misses others,” he whispered his foster-brother, his tears fell thick fast his plate. Abel made answer. He wish Jan know he given his food bits cats, he could swallow himself. But, later day, Jan found round-house, lying empty sack, his head full one. “Do not ’ee tell mother,” he said; “but I feel bad.” And Jan sat down, put his arms him, spot often sat together, learning alphabet educating thumbs, Abel laid his head his foster-brother’s shoulder, saying,— “I think, Janny dear, Mary, she wants me, others too. I think I going them. But thee’ll look mother, Janny dear, eh?” “But _I_ want thee, too, Abel dear,” sobbed January “I thinking perhaps brought thee hither’ll fetch thee away day, January But thee’ll see mother?” repeated Abel, his eyes wandering restlessly look pain. Jan knew he adopted child windmill, though he stoutly ignored fact, fond his foster-parents. Abel’s illness came force fresh blow. There slight pause course fever mill, seemed two boys spared. Abel busy helping his father burn infected bedding, etc., morning, night he lay raving. He raved Jan’s picture swung unheeded Master Chuter’s door, confused church-window he seemed fancy Jan painted; his dead brothers sisters. And time time he rambled great flock sheep he saw covering vast plains windmill, he wearied trying count. And, he tossed, he complained piteous tones man seemed shepherd, would something Abel wanted. For part, he knew one Jan, Jan touched him. It seemed give pleasure. He understood nothing said him, except brief intervals. Once, short sleep, he opened his eyes recognized schoolmaster. “Master Swift,” said he, “do ’ee think Lord among sheep? With His hair falling on’s shoulders, light round His head, long frock?” Master Swift’s eyes turned involuntarily direction Abel’s gazing. He saw nothing dark corners dwelling-room; he said,— “Ay, ay, Abel, lad.” “What His frock red for, then? Bright red, like blood. It Is like figures in—in”— Here Abel wandered again, muttered himself. But Jan crept near him, touching said, “The figures window, Abel dear,” he opened his eyes said,— “So be, Janny. With sun shining  them. Thee knows.” And he wailed fretfully,— “Why He keep His back along? I follows Him down, over, till I tired. Why do not He turn His face?” Jan speechless tears, old schoolmaster took Abel’s hot hand his, said, infinite tenderness,— “He will, lad. He will turn His face thee soon. Wait Him, Abel.” “Do ’ee think so?” said Abel. And he muttered, “You schoolmaster, ought know.” And, seemingly satisfied, he dozed more. Master Swift hurried away. He business village, he wanted catch doctor, ask his opinion Abel’s case. “Will get round, sir?” he asked. The doctor shook his head, Master Swift felt double pang. He sorry Abel, real object his anxiety January Once he hoped danger past, pestilence seemed still full strength windmill, agonizing conviction strengthened his mind his hopes disappointed, desire his eyes snatched away. The doctor thought he grieving Abel, said,— “I am sorry yourself. He is fine lad, something angelic face, ye separate surroundings. But they have constitution family. It is want strength him, strength fever, time; virulence poison’s abating. The cases recovering now, except causes intervene.” Master Swift felt almost ashamed bound his spirits. But words shut hope Abel’s recovery opened possible door escape January He one family, reasonable hope his constitution might sterner stuff. He turned lighter heart his cottage, he purposed get food return mill. There might lucid interval end, pious Abel might find comfort his lips; Jan sickened, he would nurse night day. Rufus welcomed his master merely cordiality, fussiness. The partly apologetic character his greeting accounted half starved looking dog emerged beneath table, and, immediately kicked, wagged point tail feebly, keeping respectful distance, whilst Rufus introduced it. “So ye’re playing philanthropist, ye?” said Master Swift. “Ye’ve picked one poor houseless, masterless creatures? I am undervaluing disinterested charity, Rufus, man; I wish ye’d luck light better bred beast ye it.” It is, perhaps, disadvantage call “dumb animals” understand general drift remarks without minutely following every word. They generally sense, too, leave well alone, and, without pressing question new comer’s adoption, two dogs curled round, put noses pockets, went sleep air unnecessary pursue topic farther. Master Swift shared his meal them, left keep house he returned mill. His quick eye, doubly quickened experience anxiety, saw Jan’s full fever, his limbs languid. But he would quit Abel’s side, Master Swift remained afflicted family. Abel muttered deliriously night, short intervals complete stupor. The fever, like fire, consumed his strength, fancy he toiling downs seemed weary he really foot. Just sunrise, Master Swift left asleep, went breathe out-door air. The fresh, tender light early morning every thing. The windmill stood red-barred sky outlines softened clinging dew. The plains glistened, across them, pure air, came voice Master Salter’s chanticleer distant farm. It contrast scene within Master Swift burst tears. But even he wept sun leaped horizon, and, reflected every dewdrop, tears upon old man’s cheeks, flooded world inimitable glory. The schoolmaster uncovered his head, kneeling upon short grass prayed passionately dying boy. But, he knelt increasing sunshine, his prayers peace departing soul unconsciously passed almost thanksgiving soon, little stained, exchange dingy sick-room—not sweet summer days, lose sweetness!—but taste, peace passeth understanding, GOD prepared love Him. * * * * * It whilst schoolmaster still knelt outside windmill Abel awoke, raised his eyes Jan’s smile. “Thee must go bit soon, Janny dear,” he whispered, “it lovely day.” Jan much pleased hear speak wonder he knew kind day was, Abel lay his head Jan’s arms, breathing painfully gazing him. Suddenly he raised himself, cried,—so loudly old man outside heard cry,— “Janny dear! He have turned his face me. He coming right me. Oh! He”— But HE come. CHAPTER XXVII. JAN HAS THE FEVER.—CONVALESCENCE IN MASTER SWIFT’S COTTAGE.—THE SQUIRE ON DEMORALIZATION. JAN took fever. He ill, too, partly grief Abel’s death. He also unnatural conviction he would die, unfavorable his recovery. The day he gave Master Swift his old etching last bequest, he fairly infected also belief, necessary visit village schoolmaster hung little picture his cottage breaking heart. But next time Rufus saw him, he came prepare visitor. Jan recovering, Master Swift persuaded windmiller let come cottage days, rather Mrs. Lake going stay relative whilst windmill thoroughly cleansed disinfected. The weather delightful now, and, feeble he become, Jan soon grew strong again. If he done so, would lack care Master Swift’s part. The old schoolmaster thrifty man, money laid by, he would somewhat pinched time. As was, he drew freely upon his savings Jan’s benefit, made many expeditions town buy delicacies he thought might tempt his appetite. Nor all. The morning Jan came languidly kitchen little inner room, he schoolmaster slept, he saw his precious paint-box table, fetch Master Swift windmill. And lay square book word _Sketch-book_ ornamental characters binding, couple Cumberland lead drawing pencils, three-penny chunk bottle India-rubber, delicious smell. If schoolmaster twinges regret he bought things, defiance his principles Jan’s education, melted utterly away view his delight, glow pleasure brought his pale cheeks. Master Swift regarded, too, colored sketch Rufus sitting table his arm-chair, his mongrel friend floor beside him. It best sketch Jan yet accomplished. But people familiar curious fact one often makes unaccountable stride art laid aside time. It must supposed Master Swift neglected his duties village, left Parson, Squire, doctor struggle alone, illness Abel January Even he away cottage greater part day, Jan left keep house dogs. His presence gave great contentment Rufus, scarcely lessened melancholy dignity his countenance; dogs live human beings never like left long alone. And Jan, his part, could wished nothing better sit table he hoped make leaf-pictures, paint away materials Rembrandt would disdained. The pestilence passed away. But labors Rector his staff rather increased diminished particular point. To say nothing vile wretches seem spring calamities putrid matter breeds vermin, use opportunities plunder, good many people dealt lighter shade demoralization,—people really suffered, whose daily work unavoidably stopped, idleness pleasant, fame misfortunes gratifying, preferred scramble dismantled homes, alms extracted woes, setting labor would place comfort. Then large class—the shiftless—was doubly large, widows orphans abundance, hardly bed blanket place. “I come,” said Mr. Ammaby, joining Rector he sat breakfast, “to beg you, interests village, check flow fount benevolence springs eternal clerical pocket. You ruin us shillings half crowns.” “Bless soul, Ammaby,” said Rector, pausing eggshell transfixed upon his spoon, “shillings half crowns do not go far present condition households. There ten families whose beds burnt. What propose do?” “I will tell you, I first confessed ideas entirely original. I studying political economy hard-headed Sandy, friend doctor. In first place, to-morrow, must cease _give_ thing whatever, announce determination stick it.” “And _then_, dear sir?” said Rector, smiling; nursing his black gaiter. “And _then_, dear sir,” said Mr. Ammaby, “I shall able get men work place, people distance widows relieve (at least widows look well-to-do relatives), Church, person, charged. And widows consent scrub payment, instead sitting weeping kitchen—also payment. They will, furthermore, compel interesting sons mind pigs, scare birds, instead hanging Heart Oak, begging visitors begin invade us. Do know boys will not settle work, children taking gutter-life begging, women will not even tidy houses, men retailing horrors fever every alehouse county, instead getting crops? I give word, I go inn yesterday, lad eleven twelve, did not recognize Chuter’s dark kitchen, came began beg whine would done credit professional mendicant. I stood shadow let tell his whole story, widowed mother three brothers sisters living, six dead; he would finished, two visitors fumbling pockets, I took collar lifted clean kitchen yard street. I nearly knocked Swift over, rather I nearly fell myself, concussion his burly person, he man I wanted. I said, ‘Mr. Swift, may I ask favor? This boy—whose father respectable man—has begging—_begging_! public room. His excuse his mother starving. Will kindly take Hall, put charge gardener, strict orders he good afternoon’s work weeding shrubbery. And gardener see he comes every day nine of the clock morning, works till four afternoon, till day reopen school, meal-times Sundays excepted. I pay his mother five shillings week, and, he good boy, I will give old clothes. And ever see hear his disgracing his friends begging again, do not thrash within inch his life, I shall.’ I promise you, widow might starve want five shillings young gentleman could slip his bargain. His face study. But less schoolmaster’s. The job exactly suited him, I suspect he knew lad old.” “From I have heard Swift say, I fancy he sympathizes theories,” said Rector. “I fear he sympathizes temper well theories!” laughed Squire. “As I felt flush cheek-bone, I caught fire his eye. But now, dear sir, consent strong measures prevent village becoming mere nest _lazzaroni_? Let us try system rate. I propose shut soup kitchen yet, charge small sum soup towards expenses. And I want beg write another graphic persuasive letters, appealed sympathy public misfortune.” “But, bless me!” said Rector, “I thought foe assisting people, even parson’s pocket.” “Well, I taunted doctor inconsistency, propose make sixpenny dole fund. You know certain things cannot do, help seem fairly entitled receive. We have made burn bedding, interests public safety, it is fair helped replace it. Then lot sanitary work done fund purpose; and, get money, employ idlers. The women tidy houses see new blankets, sooner churchyard made nice, monument erected, get orderly, respectable ways again, better.” “Enough, enough, dear Ammaby!” cried Rector; “I put hands, I see public appeal once; though I may mention credit compositions chiefly belongs old Swift. He knows _data_ minutely, he delights putting together. I think he regards species literary work. I hope hear good news Lady Louisa little Amabel?” “They quite well, thank you,” said Squire; “they town Lady Craikshaw, gone consult her London doctor.” “Well, farewell, Ammaby, present. Tell doctor I will give his plan trial, we will get place working order fast can.” “He charmed,” said Squire. “He says, going now, breeding two worse pests fever,—contentment remediable discomfort, dislike work.” CHAPTER XXVIII. MR. FORD’S CLIENT.—THE HISTORY OF JAN’S FATHER—AMABEL AND BOGY THE SECOND. AMONG many sounds blended one roared ever round Mr. Ford’s offices city cry newsboys. “Horful p’ticklers plague village —shire!” screamed windows. Not Mr. Ford heard them. But five minutes noiseless door opened, clerk laid morning paper table, withdrew silence. Mr. Ford cut leisurely large ivory knife, skimmed news. His eye happened fall upon Rector’s letter, which, short summary history fever, pointed objects help immediately required. There postscript. To give idea ravages epidemic, proof calamity exaggerated, list worst cases given, names particulars. It gloomy enough. “Mary Smith, lost her husband (a laborer) six children second ninth month. George Harness, blacksmith, lost his wife four children. Master Abel Lake, windmiller Tower Mill, lost his children, five number, fifth fifteenth month. His wife’s health completely broken up”— At point Mr. Ford dropped paper, and, unlocking drawer beside him, referred memoranda, he cut Rector’s letter large pair office scissors, enclosed one he wrote proceeding business. He underlined one name doleful list,—_Abel Lake_, _windmiller_. Some hours later silent clerk ushered visitor, one Mr. Ford’s clients. He gentleman middle height middle age,—the younger half middle age, though his dark hair prematurely gray. His eyes black restless, his manner haughty nervous. “I glad see you, dear sir,” said Mr. Ford, suavely; “I written note, subject I speak about.” And, he spoke, Mr. Ford tore open letter lay beside him, whilst his client saying, “We passing town way Scotland. I shall two nights.” “You remember instructing wish economize much possible minority son?” said Mr. Ford. His client nodded. “I think,” continued man business, “there quarterly payment habit making account, end.” And, he spoke, he pushed Rector’s letter across table, his fingers upon name _Abel Lake_, _windmiller_. His client always spoke stiffly, made effort he spoke less noticed lawyer. “I like certain,” he said. “I mean, exaggeration mistake.” “You never communicated man, given chance pestering you,” said Mr. Ford. “I hardly now, I think.” “I certainly kept power reopening communication hands, knowing nothing man; I sorry discontinue allowance a—a mistake kind.” Mr. Ford meditated. It may said he means knew reader knows Jan’s history; he saw his client anxious withhold money child alive. “I think I it, dear sir,” he said suddenly. “Allow write, name, worthy clergyman. I must ask subscribe his fund, name, form excuse letter, I contrive ask list cases printed accurately, his sanction. If error, shall hear it. The object subscription is—let see—is—a monument died fever and”— But dark gentleman started abruptly. “Thank you, thank you, Mr. Ford,” he said; “your plan is, usual, excellent. Pray oblige sending ten guineas name, let know if—if _is_ mistake. I call to-morrow matters.” And Mr. Ford could reply his client gone. The peculiar solitude found crowded heart London grateful his present mood. To alone his thoughts country would intolerable. The fields smack innocence, alone past apt take simple tints right wrong memory. But seething mass, represents ten thousand heartaches anxieties, doubtful shifts, open sins, bad worse man’s own, silent sympathy reproach. Mr. Ford’s client lean back, tension his mind great. He sat stiffly, gazed vacantly him, half seeing half transforming visions whatever lay hansom, wound way streets. Now moment four-wheeled cab, loaded schoolboy luggage, occupied field view, idle memories his boyhood flitted it. Then, crawling behind dray, strange associations built barrels old weatherstained wooden house Holland, intense realization past scenes love made happy put present anxieties sleep. But woke horrible pang, grim, hideous funeral car drove slowly past, nodding like nightmare. As traffic became less dense, cab went faster, man’s thoughts went faster too. He strove he often tried, review his life. He unconsciously gained it, reparation conscience might hitherto pressed impossible, plague desolated Abel Lake’s home swept skeleton his cupboard, he could repent past his duty future. His conscience stronger his courage. He long wished repent, though he found strength repair. On one point he delude he looked back his life. He sentimental regrets careless happiness youth. Is period human life tormented cares self-indulgent youth? He slave expensive habits, social traditions, past follies, ever since he could remember. He debt, pocket conscience, his schoolboy days hour. His tradesmen paid long since, and, death cancelled else he owed, easy virtue would henceforth be! It easy date his first marriage. He deeply debt, favor his father. It accounts he went abroad months. In Holland he married. His wife Jan’s mother, Jan child. Her people middle rank, leading quiet though cultivated lives. Her mother dead, she her old father’s child. It would injustice kind love she inspired her husband dwell much upon her beauty, though high type takes possession memory ever. She intensely, brilliantly fair, crowd her face shone like star. Time never dimmed one golden thread her hair; Death, done much Mr. Ford’s client, could wash face his brain. It blotted traffic streets, place Dutch pastures, whose rich green levels unbroken hedge wall, stretched flatly horizon. It bent drawing his knee he she sat sketching together old-world orchard, trees bore moss fruit. The din London absolutely unheard Mr. Ford’s client, he heard her voice, saying, “You must learn paint cattle, mean make thing Dutch scenery. And also, earth gives little variety, one must study sky. We mountains, clouds.” It orchard, apple-tree, across sketch-book, plighted troth—ten years ago. They married. Had he ever denied single gratification, would add another knot tangle his career? He pacified creditors incurring fresh debts, evaded catastrophes involving new complications his life. His marriage accomplished expense train falsehoods, his father-in-law unworldly old man, difficult deceive. He spent next ten months Holland, and, apart his anxieties, purest, happiest time he ever known. Then his father recalled peremptorily England. When Mr. Ford’s client obeyed his father’s summons, climax his difficulties seemed hand. The old man anxious reconciliation, resolved his son “settle life;” he found wife him, daughter Scotch nobleman, young, handsome, good fortune. He gave fortnight consideration. If he complied, old man promised pay his debts, make liberal allowance, every way indulgent. If he thwarted his plans, he threatened allow nothing his lifetime, leave nothing he could avoid bequeathing his death. It juncture Jan’s mother followed her husband England. Her anxieties silenced excuses satisfied her father. The crisis could hardly worse. Mr. Ford’s client felt confession inevitable; he could confess easily letter he reached London. But letter written, his wife died. Weak men, harassed personal anxieties, become hard proportion selfish fears. It like cruelty comes terror. He loved his wife; he terribly pressed, came sense relief even bitterness knowledge he free. He took body Holland, buried shadow little wooden church married; desolate old father he promised bring his grandson—January But death old nurse, whose care he placed his child, another crisis came Mr. Ford’s client. On day he got letters his father his father-in-law. From first, press his instant return home; second, say that, he could bring Jan, old man would make effort voyage England fetch him. Jan’s father almost hated him. That child lived beloved mother died offence. But freedom, peace, prosperity, dearly purchased her death, risked afresh him, irritating degree. He frantic. It impossible fail peremptory old gentleman, his father. It question allow his father-in-law come England. He could throw away his prospects. And he thought it, certain seemed Jan’s existence would ever tie Holland; his grandson’s sake old man would investigate his affairs, truth would come sooner later. The devil suggested child died mother he would quite free, intercourse Holland would died away naturally. He wished forget. To nature his type, even love he privileged enjoy become memory involving pain, instinctively evaded like unpleasant thing. He resolved, last, let nothing stand reconciliation his father. Once he must desperately mortgage future present emergencies. He wrote old father-in-law say child dead. He excused ground Jan’s welfare. If truth became fully known, his father threw off, he would poor embarrassed man, could little his child. But his father’s fortune, and, perhaps, Scotch lady’s fortune, would his power give Jan brilliant future, _even if_ he never fully acknowledged him. As yet he hardly recognized unnatural possibility. He said himself, he free, would well, Dutch grandfather would forgive lie joy discovering Jan alive, would well provided for. Mr. Ford’s client reconciled his father. He married Lady Adelaide, announced marriage his father-in-law. After which, his intercourse Holland died out. It curious result marriage made happy one. Still curious likeness, physical mental, second wife first. Lady Adelaide half Scotch half English, blonde brilliant type, intellectual order beauty. But fair women common enough. It stranger still best affections two women high moral intellectual standard devoted husband. Not quite vain. Indeed, grievous sin towards his eldest son, Mr. Ford’s client would probably become utterly different man. But rising far moral atmosphere wilful, unrepented sin clog. It miserable result weakness his character he could see nobleness Lady Adelaide’s encouraged confess her he dared trust his father’s imperious, petulant affection. But he afraid her. It his first wife. He dreaded she discover his falsehoods far he feared his father-in-law. And years happy companionship made even less tolerable think lowering Lady Adelaide’s regard. But far overwhelming consideration gathering strength eight years idea recognizing Jan his eldest son, his heir. He another son, Lady Adelaide’s child. If he hesitated boy baby tell her her darling his son, less less easy think bringing Jan,—of he knew nothing—from rough life mill supplant Lady Adelaide’s child, boy grew charming every year went by. Clever, sweet-tempered, aristocratic appearance, idolized relatives his parents, he seemed made Providence credit position he believed born. Mr. Ford’s client almost made resolve fair face Lady Adelaide’s ever rose judgment: he deciding put Jan school, give idea taking home, death seemed solved his difficulties. An unwonted ease came his heart. Surely Heaven, knowing sincerely he wished good, making goodness easy him,—was permitting settle his conscience cheaper terms repentance restitution. (And indeed, amendment, weak well strong, GOD’S great purpose us, shall say ruggedness narrow road often smoothed stumbling feet?) The fever seemed quite providential, Mr. Ford’s client felt quite pious it. He conscious mockery dwelling thought Jan “better off” Paradise his mother. And he safe—for first time since he could remember,—free last become worthier, black shadow his heels. Very touching his resolve he would better father his son his father him. If he could train high principles self-restraint, he would least indulgent consequences his indulgence, never drive fearful straits. “But he will different young man I was,” his final thought. “Thanks his good mother.” His mind full Lady Adelaide’s goodness he entered his house, she met hall. “Ah, Edward!” she cried, “I glad you have come home. I want see quaint child I telling about.” “I do not remember, dear,” said Mr. Ford’s client. “You are looking tired,” said Lady Adelaide, gently; “but child. It Lady Louisa Ammaby’s little girl. You know I met her left Brighton. I saw child once, quaintest, original little being! So unlike mother! She her mother town, going luncheon to-day I found, I asked child dine D’Arcy. Her _bonne_ taking her things, I must go bring her down.” As Lady Adelaide went out, her son came in, rushed his father. If Mr. Ford’s client failed natural affection one son, his love double intensity. He put his arm tenderly round him, whilst boy told long childish story, finished Lady Adelaide returned, leading Amabel hand. Amabel good deal taller. Her large feet adorned ornamental thread socks, leathern shoes buttoned round ankle. Her hair cropped, Lady Craikshaw said made grow. She wore big pinafore authority, spite she carried herself admirable dignity. The candor, good sense, resolution shone her clear eyes fat cheeks old. Mr. Ford’s client alarming children, Amabel shook hands courageously him. She accustomed exercise courage her behavior. From her earliest days standard manners expected her beyond her age. It consequence her growth. “You are quite big girl now,” nursery reproach addressed her least two years time, she tried valiantly live her inches. But Amabel saw D’Arcy, she started stopped short. “Will not shake hands boy, Amabel?” said Lady Adelaide. “Oh, must make friends him, he will give ride rocking-horse dinner. Surely big girl cannot shy?” Goaded old reproach, Amabel made effort, and, advancing herself, held her hand, said, “How do, Bogy?” D’Arcy’s black eyes twinkled merriment. “How do, Mother Bunch?” said he. “My _dear_ D’Arcy!” said Lady Adelaide, reproachfully. “Mamma, I rude. I joking. She calls Bogy, I call her Mother Bunch.” “But I am _not_ Mother Bunch,” said Amabel. “And I am Bogy,” retorted D’Arcy. “Yes, are,” said Amabel. “Only old clothes wood.” Lady Craikshaw cruelly warned Lady Adelaide Amabel sometimes told stories, and, thinking child romancing, Lady Adelaide tried change subject. But D’Arcy cried, “Oh, let her talk, mamma. I like her. She fun!” “You ought not laugh me,” said poor Amabel, D’Arcy took her dining-room, “I gave paint-box.” The boy’s stare amazement awoke doubt Amabel’s mind his identity Bogy woods. Between constantly peeping him, her anxiety conduct herself conformably her size etiquette dinner-table, she eat much. When dinner over, D’Arcy led her away rocking horse, he asked, “Do still think I am Bogy?” “N—no,” said Amabel, “I think perhaps you are not. But you are like him, though talk differently. Do make pictures?” D’Arcy shook his head. “Not even leaves?” said Amabel. When she going away, D’Arcy asked, “Which like best, Bogy?” Amabel pondered. “I like much. You made rocking-horse go fast; I liked Bogy. He carried hill, he picked moss. I was not afraid him. I gave kiss.” “Well, give kiss,” said D’Arcy. But tone raillery his voice put Amabel her dignity, she shook her head, began go steps house, one leg time. “If I am Bogy, know, _have_ kissed _once_,” shouted D’Arcy. But Amabel’s wits well developed her feet. “Once enough bogies,” said she, went sturdily away. CHAPTER XXIX. JAN FULFILS ABEL’S CHARGE.—SON OF THE MILL.—THE LARGE-MOUTHED WOMAN. BY time Jan went back windmill he quite well. “Ye’ll fit walk I open school,” said Master Swift. Jan promised he would redouble his pains class, gratitude good schoolmaster. But be. The day school opened, Jan came cottage. “Master Swift,” said he, “I come tell ye I afraid I cannot come school.” “And how is that?” said Master Swift. “Well, Master Swift, I think I wanted home. My father’s got Abel now; it is mother mostly wants me. I bothered mother, somehow,” said Jan, anxious look. “She forget things so, queer. She left beer-tap running yesterday, near two gallons ale ran out; morning she put kettle on, water it. And she cry terrible,” Jan added, breaking himself. “But Abel says day he took ill, ‘Janny,’ he says, ‘look mother.’ And I will.” “You are good lad, Jan,” said schoolmaster. “Sit ye get tea, I will come back ye mill. A bit company folk good that is beside fretting.” But windmiller’s wife beyond simple cure. The overtasked brain giving way, though time time capricious changes her condition led Jan hope she better, she became imbecile end her life. To say he devoted son give vague idea his life time filial duty takes shape compliance rather action, experience domestic attendance infirm body mind. It moments tender feeling, his prayers, Abel’s grave, Jan recalled his foster-brother’s dying charge; he emptied slops, cleaned grates, fastened Mrs. Lake’s black dress behind. Nor gratitude flatter his zeal. “Boys ackered hooks eyes,” poor woman grumbled her fretfulness, she sat bemoan herself she daughter left. She got trick stopping short half way her dressing, giving herself tears, led Jan’s assisting her toilette. He soon expert enough hooks eyes, tedious matter getting her courage, invariably failed her stage her linsey-woolsey petticoat. But Jan hooked her up, tied her apron on, put little shawl her shoulders, got her close-fitting cap set straight,—a matter easy putting another man’s spectacles his nose,—and seated her fire, worst over. Mrs. Lake always cheered breakfast, Jan always end hoped beginning her getting better. [Picture: He soon expert enough hooks eyes, tedious matter getting her courage, invariably failed her stage her linsey-woolsey petticoat] Even niece windmiller’s came live mill, wait Mrs. Lake, poor woman never really content without January As time went on, she wept less, her faculties became clouded. She brighter hours, company schoolmaster gave her pleasure, seemed her good. When Rector visited her, his sympathy made delicate dwelling her bereavement. When poor woman sobbed, he changed subject haste, his condolences general character. But Master Swift scruples; he sat her chair, kindly hand hers, he spoke plainly loudly. The latter Mrs. Lake’s hearing become dull. Nor he cease speak tears dropped perpetually eyes turned him, seemed day day lose color pupils, grow redder round lids weeping. “Them sleep Jesus shall GOD bring Him. Ah! Mrs. Lake, madam, they are grand words me. The Lord dealt hardly us, folk lose children it is worse. There is many Christian parent lived see grow wickedness, lost  them sins, carry _that_ weight his heart besides loss, Lord’s counsels dark him. But mine, woman, gone home innocence, say Almighty, except pray Him make us fitter take He brings back?” Through cloud hung poor woman’s spirit, Master Swift’s plain consolations made way. The ruling thought his mind became one idea her unhinged intellect clung,—the second coming Lord. For she watched—not merely sense readiness judgment, but—out upper windows windmill, could seen vast extent heaven sign Son Man be, He came. Sky-gazing old habit Jan, his active imagination slow follow his foster-mother’s fancies. The niece house-work, freakish state Mrs. Lake’s memory made her help uncertain trusted to. But, restlessness perhaps part her disease, she wandered story story windmill, guided Jan, windmiller made objection. The country folk brought grist mill would strain ears sense awe catch Mrs. Lake’s mutterings she glided hither thither mysterious shadow her spirit, miller paid respect her intellect shattered he paid whilst whole. Indeed he kind her, every Sunday he led her tenderly church, music soothed her soothed Saul old. As brain failed, she became happier, her sorrow like pain numbed narcotics; awoke time time. She would fancy children her, suddenly arouse fact not, moan she lost all. “Thee’ve got one left, mother dear,” Jan would cry, his caresses comforted her. But times she troubled imperfect remembrance Jan’s history, and, echo her old reluctance adopt him, she would wail she “did not want stranger child.” It cut Jan heart. Ever since he known he miller’s son, he protested knowledge. He loved windmill windmiller’s trade. He loved his foster-parents, desired others. He miller’s thumb, he flattened double pains his right disputed. He would press Mrs. Lake’s thin fingers proof he belonged her, simple wile successful, she would smile say, “Ay, ay, love! Thee’s miller’s boy, thee’ve got miller’s thumb.” Two three causes combined strengthen Jan’s love his home. His revolt fact he windmiller born gave energy contradiction. Then fulfil Abel’s behests, take his place mill, Jan’s chief ambition. And whence could seen glorious views windows windmill? Master Lake glad his help. The quarterly payment due weeks, but, telling schoolmaster, he said, “I would well pleased forgot un altogether, now. I do not want took away, time. And I have lost Abel, Jan’ll mill me. He is good son January” And, he echoed Jan’s praises, never dawned Master Swift he allowance stopped. Jan jealous his title Master Lake’s son, schoolmaster dwelt much his mind fact Jan real child district; partly his ambition him, partly dim hope he would day allowed adopt him. In stating windmiller lost his children fever, he stated bare fact good faith; neither he Rector guessed real drift Mr. Ford’s letter, mistake never corrected. Jan useful mill. He swept round-house, coupled sacks, received grist grist-bringers, took payment grinding money kind, according custom. The old women toddled bags gleaned corn looked kindly him, would say, “Thee good bwoy, sartinly, Jan, Lard’ll reward thee.” If windmiller came towards one dames, she would say, “Aal right, Master Lake, I manners hurry, Jan’ll me.” And, Jan came, his business-like method justified her confidence. “Good day, mother,” he would say. “Will ye pay, toll it?” “Bless ye, dear love, I pay?” old woman would reply. “I will toll it, Jan, thank ye kindly.” On Jan would dip wooden bowl tolling-dish sack, corn brought established rate payment grinding rest. But, though he constantly assured schoolmaster he meant windmiller, Jan neglect his special gift. He got many dawn paint sunrise. In still summer afternoons, mill-sails idle, Mrs. Lake dozing heat, he betook water-meads sketch. In mill he made countless studies. Not ever-changing heavens, monotonous sweeps great plains, whose aspect changeable one might think, studies various floors mill, roundhouse, old meal-bins swollen sacks looked picturesque dim light falling above, also circular stones, shaft, hoppers, became effective subjects Cumberland lead-pencils. Towards end summer following fever, Mrs. Lake failed rapidly. She sat doors day, miller moving her chair one side another mill get shade. Master Swift brought her big nosegays his garden, she would smell hours, scent soothed her. She spoke little, she watched sky constantly. One evening gorgeous sunset. In splendor, countless multitude little clouds bright light, glory sun seemed little less Lord Himself, coming ten thousand His saints, poor woman gazed her withered, wistful eyes could see her children among radiant host. “I think Lord coming to-night, Master Swift,” she said. “And He will bring Him.” She gazed glory faded, lingered till grew dark, schoolmaster gone home. It till her dress quite wet dew Jan insisted upon her going indoors. They coming round mill dusk, cry broke Mrs. Lake’s lips; echo louder one January A woman creeping round mill opposite direction craned her neck forward Jan his foster-mother saw her face instant disappeared. Why Jan terrified, he would puzzled say, woman hideous, though she ugly mouth. But he terrified, none less conviction she looking intently intentionally him. When he got his foster-mother indoors, miller disposed think affair fancy; but, shock given spur her feeble senses, Mrs. Lake said loud clear voice, “Maester, woman brought Jan hither!” But miller ran out, one seen. CHAPTER XXX. JAN’S PROSPECTS AND MASTER SWIFT’S PLANS.—TEA AND MILTON.—NEW PARENTS.—PARTING WITH RUFUS.—JAN IS KIDNAPPED. THIS shock seemed give last jar frail state Mrs. Lake’s health, sleep she fell night passed state insensibility her sorely tried spirit released without pain. It said windmiller looked twice his age trouble. But his wan appearance may partly due inroads lung disease, comes millers constantly inhaling flour-dust. His cheeks grew hollow, his wasted hands displayed windmiller’s coat arms {238} painful distinctness. The schoolmaster spent his evenings mill; sometimes Jan went tea him, Master Lake’s desire he went school more. Master Swift thought none less Jan’s prospects useless discuss Master Lake. All his plans founded belief he would live train boy windmiller, whilst Master Swift’s reference conviction “miller’s consumption” would deprive Jan his foster-father long he old enough succeed him. And miller made his will? Master Swift made his, left his savings January He could help hoping turn Fortune’s wheel give lad his own. Jan likely lack friends. The Squire heard amazement Master Chuter’s new sign work child, he offered place proper instruction trained artist. But, time offer came, Jan waiting his foster mother, he refused betray Abel’s trust. The Rector also wished provide him, he even easily convinced Jan’s present duty lay home. Master Swift urged good faith, his personal love Jan, dread parting him, influence he hardly conscious. One evening, weeks Mrs. Lake’s death, Jan tea, followed poetry, schoolmaster. Master Swift often recited windmill. The miller liked hear hymns his wife liked, patriotic romantic verses; he yawned Milton, fell asleep Keats, schoolmaster reserved his favorites Jan’s ear alone. When tea over, Jan sat rush-bottomed chair, his feet Rufus, side hearth faced window, side sat Master Swift, mongrel lying him, he spouted Milton. Jan, familiar many sunrise, listened parted lips pleasure, old man trolled forth,— “Right eastern gate, Where great sun begins his state, Robed flames amber light,” even sympathy latter part ‘Il Penseroso;’ and, ended he begged yet more, old man began ‘Lycidas.’ He knew heart, waving his hand, his eyes fixed expressively Jan, he cried,— “Fame spur clear spirit doth raise (That last infirmity noble minds) To scorn delights, live laborious days.” And tears filled his eyes, made his voice husky, he went on,— “But fair guerdon hope find, And think burst sudden blaze, Comes blind Fury abhorred shears”— Master Swift stopped suddenly. Rufus growling, Jan white rigid, his eyes fixed window. As North countrymen, schoolmaster ineradicable touch superstition. He cursed “unlucky” poem, flinging book ran his favorite. As soon Jan could speak, he gasped, “The woman brought mill!” But Master Swift went search garden he could find one. Remembering former alarm, one seen then, Master Swift came conclusion case delusion. “Ye’re dear good lad, Jan,” said he, “but ye’ve fagged out. Take dog ye to-morrow company, sketch-book, amuse yourself. I will expect ye school. And get away bed now. I told Master Lake I should not let ye away to-night.” Jan went bed, next morning lark, Rufus his heels went distant place, mound, smaller road crossed highway London, view he wished sketch early light. As he drew near, he saw small cart, one side horse feeding, foot mound sat woman pedler’s basket. When Jan recognized her, late run away. And whither could he run? The four white roads gleamed unsheltered plains; place hide in, soul sight. When large-mouthed woman seized Jan her arms, kissing cried aloud, “Here he last! My child, long lost child!” despair sank poor boy’s heart made speechless. Was possible woman his mother? His foster-mother’s words tolled like knell his ears,—“The woman brought Jan hither.” At sound Sal’s voice hunchback appeared behind cart, his wife dragged Jan towards him, crying, “Here is dear son! pretty, clever little son.” “I bean’t son!” cried poor Jan, desperately. “My mother’s dead.” For moment Cheap Jack’s wife seemed staggered; unluckily Jan added, “She died last month,” evident he knew nothing his real history. “Oh, mill people, false wretches!” screamed woman. “Have I paying  them precious child, time,  them teach deny his mother! The brutes!” Jan’s face eyes blazed passion. “How dare abuse good father mother!” he cried. “_You_ wretch, and”— But this, moment, Cheap Jack seized Jan furiously throat, Rufus sprang upon hunchback. The hunchback greater danger, his wife’s presence mind saved him. She shrieked let Jan go, he might call dog, vindictive little Cheap Jack loath do. And Jan got Rufus off, holding collar, hunchback seized hatchet he cutting stakes, rushed upon dog. Jan put them, crying incoherently, “Let alone! He is mine—he will not hurt you—I will send home—I will let un loose ye do not;” Sal held back her husband, said, “If you will behave civil, Jan, dear, poor mother, may send dog home. And well too, John’s man that is particular he puts place like there is one tell tales. He would chop limb limb, soon not.” Jan shuddered. There choice save Rufus. He clung round curly brown neck one agonized embrace, steadied his voice authoritative, “Home, Rufus!” he let go. Rufus hesitated, looked dangerously hunchback, lifted hatchet. Jan shouted angrily, “Home, Rufus!” Rufus obeyed. Twenty times, his familiar figure, plumy tail curled sideways, lessened along road, Jan tempted call back his destruction; he not. Only brown speck fairly lost sight, his utter friendlessness overwhelmed him, falling his knees he besought woman tears let go,—at least tell Master Lake it. The hunchback began reply angry oaths, Sal made signs silent, said, “It comes hard me, Jan, treated way son, but, you will good boy, I am willing oblige you, we will drive round mill let see friends, though it is way too.” Jan profuse thanks, woman’s desire he sat share breakfast. The hunchback examined his sketch-book, and, he laid again, he asked, “Did ever make picters stone, eh?” “Before I could get paper, I did, sir,” said January “But could now? Could make  them flat stone, like paving-stone?” “If I would thing draw with, I could,” said January “I could draw thing, I something hand draw with.” The Cheap Jack’s face became brighter, mollified tone he said his wife, “He is prime card young un. It is rum thing, too! A man I knowed grand screeving, he said he nowheres paper. He made fifteen eighteen shillin’ week average,” hunchback continued. “I have knowed take two pound.” “Did ever draw fish, dear?” he inquired. “No, sir,” said January “But I have drawn pigs dogs, I mostly able draw thing I sees, I think.” The Cheap Jack whistled. “Profiles pays well,” he murmured; “but tip Young Prodigy.” “We are pleased see clever boy are, Jan,” said Sal; “that is all, dear. Put bridle horse, John, we have got go round mill.” Whilst Cheap Jack obeyed her, Sal poked cart, she returned three tumblers plate. She gave one her husband, took one herself, gave third January “Here is health, love,” said she; “drink mine, Jan, I will good mother you.” Jan tasted, put his glass again, choking. “It is strong!” he said. The Cheap Jack looked furious. “Nice manners they have taught brat yours!” he cried Sal. “Do ye think I am going take ’oss mile road take see his friends, he will not much drink good healths?” “Oh! I will, indeed I will, sir,” cried January He taken good deal medicine his illness, he learned art gulping. He emptied little tumbler his mouth, swallowed contents gulp. They choked him, nothing. Then he felt something seized inside every limb. After he lost power moving, he could hear, he heard Cheap Jack say, “I would go Young Prodigy; genteel first; only, goes among nobs, he may recognized. He is rum-looking beggar.” “If do not go drinking every penny he earns,” said Sal, pointedly, “we will soon get enough common line take us Ameriky, he will safe enough there.” On Jan thought he made desperate struggle remonstrance. But reality his lips never moved rigidity, he rolled his head upon his shoulder. After he remembered more. CHAPTER XXXI. SCREEVING.—AN OLD SONG.—MR. FORD’S CLIENT.—THE PENNY GAFF.—JAN RUNS AWAY. THERE large crowd, large crowds gather quickly London small causes. It out-of-the-way spot too, police yet tried disperse it. The crowd gathered round street-artist “screeving,” drawing pictures pavement colored chalks. A good many men followed trade London success, artist wan, meagre-looking child. It January He drew extraordinary rapidity; rapidity slovenliness, rapidity genius choice Ruskin calls “fateful lines.” At his back stood hunchback, “pattered” description drawings glibly he used “puff” his wares Cheap Jack. “Cats roof ’ouse. Look  them, ladies gentlemen; harched backs tails whiskers, moon a-shining sky, you will say they are natteral life. Bo-serve fierceness eye black Tom. The one that is a-coming round chimney-pot Sandy; yellow ochre body, markings red. There is not harpist living could  them better, though I says that is lad’s father.” The cats popular, Prize Pig, Playful Porkers, Sow her Little Ones, exhibited Cheap Jack. But prime favorite “The Faithful Friend,” consisting sketches Rufus various attitudes, including last sleep grave supposititious master, Jan drew heart ached must break. It growing dark, exhibition successful day, crowd still large, hunchback loath desist. At sign him, Jan put his colored chalks little pouch front him, drew powerful chiaroscuro soft black chalk whitening. These sketches visible time, interest crowd abate. Suddenly flush came Jan’s wan cheeks. A baker paused moment look, passed on, singing he went, song man’s accent familiar January “The swallow twitters barn, The rook cawing tree, And wood ring-dove coos”— “What is name, boy?” The peremptory tone question turned Jan’s attention song, died away street, looking he met pair eyes black his own, Mr. Ford’s client repeated his question. On seeing “swell” paused look, Cheap Jack hurried Jan’s side, time answer. “John Smith’s his name, sir. He is slow speech, lord, though quick his pencil. There is many artists beat him, though I says should not, his father.” “_You_ his father?” said gentleman. “He much like you.” “He favours his mother more, lord,” said Cheap Jack; “and that is he gets his talents too.” “No one ever thought he got  them you, old hump!” said one spectators, roar laughter bystanders. Mr. Ford’s client still lingered, though staring pushing rude crowd annoying him. “Do really belong man?” he asked Jan, Jan replied, trembling, “Yes, sir.” “Your son does not look treated well,” said gentleman, turning Cheap Jack. “Take that, give good supper evening. He deserves it.” As Cheap Jack stooped half crown thrown him, Mr. Ford’s client gave Jan pence, saying, “You keep yourself.” Jan’s face, look gratitude upon it, seemed startle afresh, getting dark, crowd closing round him. Jan entertained wild thought asking his protection, he gone. What strange gentleman said his unlikeness Cheap Jack, also thoughts awakened hearing old song, gave new energy resolve Jan previously come. He resolved run away. Since he awoke stupor draught Sal given cross-roads, found utterly power unscrupulous couple pretended his parents, his life miserable enough. They never intended take back mill, and, since came London he quite mercy, made pretence kindness. That kept constantly work could hardly counted evil, his working hours ones happiness them, except he dreamed home. Not cold pavement chilling his ragged clothes, strange staring jesting rough crowds, even hideous sense hunchback’s vigilant oversight him, could destroy his pleasure sense daily increasing powers his fingers, genius seemed tremble create. In weeks his apprenticeship screeving, Jan improved quickly he might done teaching Squire willing procure village genius. At peril floggings Cheap Jack, many already scarred his thin shoulders, he ransacked his brains telling subjects, forced his memory lines told most, told quickly, pathetic look Rufus’s face, anger, pleasure, playfulness mill cats. Perhaps none us know might forced, natural indolence, fallow ground capabilities many lines. The spirit popular subject fewest possible strokes Jan aim his daily bread, peril bodily harm hour hour, day day, his hand gained cunning might never otherwise learned, could never unlearn now. In respects, his learning altogether evil. Perhaps wished reconcile his life, perhaps his innocent face uncorrupted character annoyance reproach wicked couple, encouraged Jan associate boys neighboring courts. Many people sorry believe great many wicked depraved grown-up people large towns, whose habits vice firm, whose moral natures loose, reformation practically almost hopeless. But much fewer people realize fact thousands little children actively, hideously vicious degraded. And yet better remembered that, since, though painful, hopeful. It hard reform vicious children, easier reform vicious men women. Little boys little girls eight nine ten years old, also drunkards, sweaters, thieves, gamblers, liars, vicious, made Jan laughing-stock, his simple childlike ways. They called “green;” but, he made friends drawing pictures them, tried teach terrible lore. Once Cheap Jack gave Jan penny go boys penny theatre, “gaff.” The depravity entertainment light matter depravity children place crowded, much lost never found shame. Jan standing amongst them, he caught sight boy white head leaning gallery, whose face curious accidental likeness Abel’s. The expression quite different, one partly imbecile, likeness enough recall past unutterable pang. What would Abel said see there? Jan could breathe place. The others engaged, he fought his way out. What he heard seen rang his ears danced his eyes he crept bed, dawn broke streets. But Abel watched his bedside he used do, kept evil visions away, trouble his dreams. He dreamed windmill, his foster-mother; little wood, Master Swift Rufus. After night Jan resolved that, whether Sal his mother not, he would run away. In strength his foster-brother’s pious memory he would escape evil life. He would beg his way back village, upright, godly old schoolmaster, least die country road thither. He associated ragamuffins court without learning little cunning; he waited impatiently chance eluding watchfulness Cheap Jack. But sound song meeting Mr. Ford’s client determined wait longer, make desperate effort freedom there. The Cheap Jack collecting pence, Jan made bold black strokes beginning new sketch, he ran Cheap Jack whispered, “Get ha’perth whitening, father, fast can. There is oil-shop yonder.” “All right, Jan,” said hunchback. “Keep  them together, dear, meanwhile. We are prime, shall sausage supper.” As Cheap Jack waddled away whitening, Jan said lockers-on, “Keep places, ladies gentlemen, till I return, keep eyes drawing, last series,” ran narrow street, right angles oil-shop. The crowd waited patiently moments. Then Cheap Jack hurried back whitening. But Jan returned more. CHAPTER XXXII. THE BAKER.—ON AND ON.—THE CHURCH BELL.—A DIGRESSION.—A FAMILIAR HYMN.—THE BOYS’ HOME. JAN stopped last lack breath go on. His feet winged terror, he looked back even fear see Cheap Jack’s misshapen figure pursuit. He food hours, pence dark gentleman given his chalk pouch, he turned first baker’s shop he came buy penny loaf. It small shop, served pleasant-faced man, went down, humming, whistling, singing,— “Like tiny pipe wheaten straw, The wren his little note doth swell, And every living thing flies”— “A penny loaf, please,” said Jan, laying money, man turned said, “Why, boy draws pavement!” For moment Jan silent. It presented new difficulty, he likely recognized. There flour barrel counter, he pondered he began mechanically sift flour his finger thumb. “You used flour seemingly,” said baker, smiling. “Was ’ee ever mill? ’ee seems miller’s thumb.” In minutes Jan told his story, learned, amazement delight, baker windmiller’s man, worked Master Lake’s tower mill. He was, fact, man helped George night Jan arrived. But he confirmed fact Sal brought Jan, his account her, he seemed think she probably his mother. He kind. He refused take payment loaf, went, humming, whistling, singing, away get Jan bacon eat it. When he alone, Jan’s hand went back flour, he sifted thought. The baker kind, he said “it ackerd thing boy quarrel with’s parents.” Jan felt he expected go home. Perhaps moment baker gone, best intentions, fetch Cheap Jack, bring family reunion. Terror become abiding state Jan’s mind, seized afresh, like palsy. He left penny counter, shook flour-dust his fingers, and, stealing side glances dread street, he sped away more. He knowledge localities. He ran “on on,” people fairy tales. Sometimes he rested doorstep, sometimes he hid shutter box archway. He learned avoid police, he moved quickly one dark corner another hunted look his black eyes. Late night he found heap straw near warehouse, he lay fell asleep. At eight of the clock next morning he awakened clanging bell, he jumped time avoid porter coming warehouse, ran “on on.” It bright morning, sun shining; Jan’s feet sore, his bones ached cold weariness. Yesterday struggle escape Cheap Jack kept up, he could feel his utter loneliness misery. There friendly sound noises great city,—the street cries food he could buy, quarrelling, laughter he concern, tramp strange feet, roar traffic prosperity he part. He lonely, desolate, sound came familiar pleasant, full old good happy associations, seemed bring his sad life climax, give one strain much his powers endurance. Like white lights he put his black sketches, seemed bring darkness his life relief, he felt he could bear more, would like sit die. The sound came porch church. It singing hymn,—one Charles Wesley’s hymns, Master Swift fond. The sooty iron gates open, door. Jan crept peep, he caught sight stained window full pale faces, seemed beckon him, he went church one molested him. There popular bit I venture think partly false philosophy comes magazines story books shape satirical contrasts words General Confession, Litany, particular materials worshippers, intercessors, confessing sinners happen clothed. But, since broadcloth never yet made stout enough keep temptation soul, silk proved protection sorrow, I confess I never could see thing incongruous confessions petitions handsomely dressed people ragged ones. That sinner “miserable” satin, seems impossible, least offensive, minds; perhaps know least reckless, callous light-heartedness ragged reprobates. This nothing do, seems me, fact certain degree outlay dress criminal, several grave accounts; even incongruous spectacle becoming bonnet arranged Litany tightly gloved fingers worshipper, would probably devout uncomfortably conscious bad clothes. An old friend childhood used tell she always thought good deal her dress going church, she might quite forget there. Surely, dress absolutely nothing devotion. And impertinent patronage worshippers “fustian” least offensive older-fashioned vulgarity pride congregations “come carriages.” And I protest flippant inference good clothes body must lower assumptions spirit, make repentance insincere; I believe worship clean Christian less acceptable brother cannot afford value use soap. I perhaps anxious defend congregation, Jan stumbled pale light early morning city, imputation sincerity worship, mostly comfortably clad. The men chiefly business men, good deal obnoxious “broadcloth” them, well-brushed hats beneath seats. One stoutest comfortable-looking, intelligent face fair clean complexion spoke good food, stood near door. He wore new great-coat velvet collar, his gray eyes (they seen middle age, shine flash youthful enthusiasm) fixed upon window, he sang heartily, heart,— “Other Refuge I none! Hangs helpless soul Thee; Leave, ah! leave alone, Still support comfort me.” The tears flowed Jan’s cheeks. It favorite hymn his foster-mother, he often sung her. Master Swift used “give note,” sink bass part, quaint duets common mill. How delightful simple pleasures seem look back dark places earth, full misery wickedness! In spite his tears, Jan fain join hymn went on, he sang like bird,— “All trust Thee stayed, All help Thee I bring; Cover defenceless head With shadow Thy wing.” It hymn third collect, ended comfortable-looking gentleman motioned Jan seat, he knelt down. When service over, gentleman took arm, asked, “What is matter you, boy?” A rapid survey his woes led Jan reply, “I have home, sir.” The congregation dispersed quickly, men going business. This gentleman walked fast, he hurried Jan along him. “Who parents?” he asked. The service recalled Jan’s highest associations, he anxious tell strict truth. “I do not rightly know, sir,” said he. “Are hungry?” “Yes, sir,” sobbed poor January They stopping large house, gentleman said, “Look here, boy. If good home, good food, clothes, would work? Would try good lad, learn honest trade?” “I would glad, sir,” said January “Have ever worked? What do?” asked gentleman. “I mind pigs; I think ’twould best I mill, I have got miller’s thumb.” Jan said idea struck he could get home he might hire mop Master Lake. A traditional belief force law hiring made think would protect claim Cheap Jack. Before gentleman could reply, house-door opened boy years older Jan, despatched fetch “the master.” Jan felt sure must school, though he puzzled contents room waited. It filled pretty specimens joiner’s cabinet-maker’s work, quite partly finished. There also brushes various kinds, that, suitable window, Jan would concluded shop. In two three moments master’s step sounded passage. Jan pleasant associations word “master,” he looked vague fancy seeing second Master Swift. Not Master Swift, one else slow-going little village, ever walked sharp, hasty tread, one hoped overtake time! With step gentleman went away, he said Jan, “Be good boy, lad, attend master, he will good friend you.” He least like Master Swift. He young, youthfully dressed. A schoolmaster neither spectacles black coat new idea Jan; he seemed kind, for, sharp look Jan’s pinched face, he said, “You will glad breakfast, lad, I fancy; breakfast’s over. Come along.” And away he went double quick time passage, Jan ran him. On way kitchen, crossed open court boys playing, round ran mottoes large letters. “You read?” said master, quickly, he caught Jan’s eyes following texts. “Have ever school?” “Yes, sir,” said January “Can write? What else learned?” Jan pondered his stock accomplishments. “I write, sir, cipher. And I have learned geography history, Master Swift gave I lessons mechanics, I fond poetry painting, and”— The master painfully familiar inventive boastful powers street boys. He pushed Jan kitchen, saying smartly, good-humoredly, “There, there! Do not make stories, boy. You must learn speak truth, come Home. We do not expect poets painters,” he added, smiling. “If chop wood, learn you are taught, you will us.” A smile stole face shrewd-looking lad washing dishes table. Jan saw he believed, his tears fell mug cocoa, bread formed his breakfast. CHAPTER XXXIII. THE BUSINESS MAN AND THE PAINTER.—PICTURES AND POT BOILERS.—CIMABUE AND GIOTTO.—THE SALMON-COLORED OMNIBUS. THE business men half way business shadow sooty church still fell upon one two congregation dispersed slowly; aged poor lingered infirmity well leisure; man neither old poor, whose strong limbs bear away much quicker pace. His enjoyment peculiar pleasures early walk deliberate well full, bustle formed necessary part his trade. He painter. The business gentleman hurrying Boys’ Home stumbled painter, he knew, he would sorry avoid. The next salmon-colored omnibus passed end street would enable punctual he could catch it, painter, his opinion, “no sense value time.” The painter, hand, held strong conviction his friend’s sense monetary value time exaggerated hinder his sense many higher things beautiful world. But fast friends nevertheless, equal charity pitied respectively slovenly slavish way life. “My dear friend!” cried artist, seizing elbow, “you coming I thinking going.” “By means, dear fellow,” said Jan’s friend, shaking hands release his elbow, “the master delighted, and—my time own, know.” “I know well,” said artist, little humorous malice. “It belongs others. That benevolence. So”— “Come, come!” laughed other. “I am man leisure like you. I must catch next salmon-colored omnibus.” “I will walk it, talk go. You cannot propose run time life, position city! Now tell me, good friend, boys Home offscouring streets, are not they?” “They mostly destitute lads, never convicted crime yourself. It fundamental distinction Home industrial schools. Our effort save boys destitution _all but_ made criminal. It reformatory.” “I beg pardon, I know. But I speaking bodily condition only. I want model, glad get without nuisance sketching slums. Such ragged, pinched, eager, yet stupid child might sit homeless black walls Newgate churchyard St. Sepulchre,—a waif richest benevolent society Christendom, alternative churchyard would better.” “Not one, I trust,” said business gentleman, almost passionately. “I trust GOD, alternative. If I hope, greater effective efforts hitherto rescue children London crime.” In warmth outburst, he permitted salmon-colored omnibus escape him, but, much good man business waste time regrets, he placed convenient point catching next, went speaking. “I glad hear another picture hand.” “Not _picture_—a _pot boiler_,” said artist, testily. “Low art—domestic sentiment—cheap pathos. My _picture_ one would look at, even finished, I could bring part it.” “Mind, give first refusal.” “Of _picture_?” “Yes, is, I mean street boy. It line. I delight things. But do not make pathetic, wife will not able bear drawing room. Your things always make her cry.” “That is pot boiler,” said artist; “I really wish you would look picture, unfinished is. I like it. Anybody’ll take pot boiler. I want model picture too, and, oddly enough, boy; one cannot provide with.” “No? The subject say is”—said man business, dreamily, he strove time make distant omnibus yellow salmon-colored. “Cimabue finding boy Giotto drawing sand. Ah! friend, one realize meeting? Can one picture generous glow mature courtly artist recognized unconscious genius struggling form shepherd lad,—yearning his great Italian eyes glowing landscape whose beauties could written sand? Will golden age arts ever return? We hardly moving towards it, I fear. For I found model Cimabue,—an artist too, true one; boy Giotto! Still I like see it. I flatter coloring”— “Salmon,” said man business, briskly. “I thought yellow. My dear fellow—_Hi_!—take many boys like—_To City_!” The conductor salmon-colored omnibus touched his bell, painter left alone. CHAPTER XXXIV. A CHOICE OF VOCATIONS.—RECREATION HOUR.—THE BOW LEGGED BOY.—DRAWING BY HEART.—GIOTTO. JAN found favor his new friends. The master’s sharp eyes noted prescribed ablutions seemed pleasant familiar new boy, superintendent wood-chopping department expressed his opinion Jan’s intelligence dexterity wasted among fagots, his vocation brushmaker least, joiner. Of trades open Home Jan inclined cabinet-making. It must amusing dab little bunches bristles deftly little holes hot pitch produce hearth-brush, life-work satisfy ambition. For boot-making he felt fancy, tailor’s shop dash corduroy closeness atmosphere grateful nostrils long refreshed breezes plains. But, elder boy led airy room cabinet-maker, Jan found subject interest. The man making piece furniture order; boys done rough work, he finishing it. It combination shelves cupboard, something like old oak cabinet stood Master Chuter’s parlor, which, Jan’s opinion, handsomer convenient this. When joiner, amused keen gaze Jan’s black eyes, asked good-naturedly “how he liked it,” Jan expressed his opinion, illustrate he involuntarily took fat pencil lying bench, made sketch Master Chuter’s cabinet upon bit wood. News spreads mysterious swiftness communities, large small. Before dinner-time, known throughout Home master joiner applied new boy pupil, he could draw black-lead pencil, set his betters rights. The master passed several phases feeling Jan morning. His first impression dispelled Jan’s orderly ways, absence vagrant restlessness him. The joiner’s report awoke hope he would become star institution, his acquirements came light, he proved merely good voice, choir, master’s generous hopes received check, day passed he became convinced case “restored his friends.” When two of the clock came, boys “recreation,” Jan endure chaff subject his accomplishments. But banter London street boys familiar him, he took good part. When found good-tempered, he soon popular, asked his history friendly curiosity. “And vot sort mansion hang ven wos home?” inquired little lad, whose rosy cheeks dancing eyes would qualified sit model hero little tale rustic life simplicity, graduated lowest lore streets much he properly able walk he bandy-legged consequence. There must blood domestic vagrant currents, he rule one steadiest best-behaved boys establishment. Only time time he burst street slang strongest description, apparently relief his feelings. Happily heart, Boys’ Home guided large-minded counsels, eyes master eyes Argus, could also wink occasion. “Hout it!” said bow-legged boy, straddling January “If wos Buckingham Palace resided in, make clean breast it, hease mind.” “Thee knows palaces likes me. Thee manners fine,” said Jan; repartee drew roar laughter, bandy-legged boy joined. “But I have lived windmill,” Jan added, “and thee’ve done, I fancy.” Some boys seen windmills, not; strong tendency among boys give exaggerated, say totally fictitious, descriptions buildings boys not. There quick, prevailing impression, however, Jan’s word could trusted, he appealed to. “Take picter,” said bandy-legged boy. “We heered took _sweet furnitur_ Master’s face. Take windmill, lived it.” There bit chalk Jan’s pocket, courtyard paved. He knelt down, boys gathered round him. They sharp enough sympathetic, he begged quiet kept breathless silence, broken distant roar London outside, Master’s voice speaking adjoining passage. “I hardly say, sir, I _fear_, I think you will find look hearty comfortable purpose.” About Jan silence breathless. The bow-legged boy literally laid his hand upon his mouth, he better laid his eyes, seemed danger falling sockets. Jan covered his moment, looked upwards. Back upon his sensitive memory rolled past, like returning tide sweeps every thing it. Much clearer roofs chimney-stacks windmill stood sky, arms outstretched recall truant son. If he needed draw from, there, plain enough. But he need see it, whose heart every line written? He could laid his hand dark upon bricks weather-stained fanciful landscapes upon walls, planted his feet spot grass worn base. He drew power rapidity awe look upon his face could kept silence little crowd he forgotten. And last scrap chalk crumbled, he dragged his blackened finger foreground till bled, voice broke silence voice stranger, stood master threshold court-yard. Never perhaps conveyed one word he spoke, though meaning known alone,— “GIOTTO!” CHAPTER XXXV. “WITHOUT CHARACTER?”—THE WIDOW.—THE BOW-LEGGED BOY TAKES SERVICE.—STUDIOS AND PAINTERS. “MANAGE like,” artist said master Boys’ Home. “Lend him, sell him, apprentice him, give me,—whichever prefer. Say I want boot-black—a clothes-brusher—a palette-setter—a bound slave—or adopted son, please. The boy I must have: capacity I get nothing me.” “I bound remind you, sir,” said master, “that he picked streets, training, earned outfit us. He comes without clothes, without character”— “Without character?” cried artist. “Heavens earth! Did ever study physiognomy? Do know thing faces?” “It part duty know something them, sir,” began master, slightly nettled. “Then do not talk nonsense, friend, send boy, soon consistent rules regulations.” The boy January The man business gave his consent, he implored his “impulsive friend,” he termed artist, ruin lad indulgence, keep his proper place, give plenty do. In conformity sensible advice, Jan’s first duties his new home clean painter’s boots he could find them, shake his velveteen coat pockets empty, sweep studio, clean brushes, go errands. The artist old bachelor, infamously cheated rheumatic widow he paid perform domestic work his rooms; afflicted lady gave warning asked hot water later hour usual, Jan persuaded artist enforce her departure, took her place. So heavy iron weight custom—when takes form elderly widowed domestic single gentleman—that even Jan’s growing influence would secured her dismissal, artist particular reason wishing boy’s practical talents displayed. He suspected his business friend distrusting Jan’s artistic genius, he proud boast he never known comfort clean rooms well-cooked food till “the boy Giotto” became his housekeeper. The work play Jan his slavery hunchback, his happiness living painter needless dwell. For week two, artist busy his “pot boiler,” pay much attention his new apprentice, Jan watched without disturbing him; he offered set painter’s palette, his master regarded his success inspiration genius, rather result habits observation. The painter, though clever ambitious, pure elegant taste, mighty genius himself. The average public taste art low enough, refusing his “high art” pictures, buying his domestic ones, public far wrong. It must confessed he also vein indolence his nature, Jan soon painted pot boilers. Another his duties sit model picture. The painter sketched again, never quite satisfied. What vision windmill lit depth his black eyes could recalled order painter’s studio. “I tell is,” said artist one day; “domestic servitude taking poetry you. You are getting fat, Giotto! Understand henceforth I forbid black boots grates, brush, dust, wash, cook, whatever disturbs peace hinders growth soul. I must get widow back!” painter heaved deep sigh. But Jan resolute widow. He effected compromise. The bandy-legged boy Home taken painter’s service, Jan made responsible his good conduct. He began warning his vivacious friend freemasonry common street-boyhood could hinder duty he owed his master protecting his property insuring his comfort, he must sooner tell tales his friend painter wronged. To homily bandy-legged boy listened his red cheeks artificially distended, occasional murmurs “Crikey!” he took service terms, Jan discredit. He incorruptibly honest, time time street fever seized him, he left his work play post-leaping outside, Jan would quietly take his place, betray him. This kindness invariably drew tears penitence soft-hearted young vagrant, his freaks grew rarer rarer, he finally became steady he quick-witted. Jan’s duties confined painting-room, he soon became familiar studios artists, his intelligent admiration paintings took his fancy, his modesty, his willing good-nature, his precocious talent made general favorite. He went regularly his master early service sooty little church, choir he finally enrolled. And man business kept friendly eye him, gave many piece sensible practical advice, balance evils artistic career. With Bohemianism artist-life Jan soon familiar Bohemianism streets. A certain old-fashioned gravity, always amongst his characteristics, helped preserve his dignity modesty manner gave man business great satisfaction. He might easily spoiled, he not. He answered respectfully dozen names vagrant fancy young painters bestowed upon him: Jan-of-all-work—Jan Steen—The Flying Dutchman—Crimson Lake—Madder Lake—and Miller’s Thumb. But his master called GIOTTO. He happy, old home haunted him, he longed bitterly news his foster-father schoolmaster. Whilst terror Cheap Jack still oppressing him, he feared open communication past, fear wretched couple supposed his parents discover reclaim him. But his nerves recovered tone, horrors his life screever faded softer tints, boon poor humanity—forgetfulness—healed his wounds, he began go streets without thinking hunchback every corner, he felt inclined risk thing know his old friends fared. There also grew upon conviction Cheap Jack’s story false. He knew enough art now, value his powers, struggle livelihoods London, see good speculation kidnap him. He serious doubts whether cart driven round mill, whether Master Lake refused let awakened his sleep, said was, “All right, he hoped lad would his duty his good parents.” He remembered, too, hunchback’s words he lay speechless drugged liquor, raised puzzling question: Why “the nobs” recognize him? He learned _nobs_ are. Spelt without “k,” grand people, grand people Sal’s son? One cannot live without sympathy, Jan confided complexities his history bow-legged boy, interest awakened young gentleman could gratifying his friend. He kept one eye closed story, he saw whole thing (_too_ clearly) glance. He broke thread Jan’s narrative comments obvious bearing facts, and, ended, gave his opinion certain penny romances he named joke it. “Oh, my! pity cannot employ detective!” he said. “Whoever knowed young projidy find his noble relations without detective? But never mind, January I knows ways. I am dodges. Fust all, makes mind deep inside, says nothing nobody, follows up. Fol-lows up!” “I do not know follow,” said Jan; “and I make mind, I know nothing?” “That is is,” said his friend; “if knowed every thing, wot ’ud use coming detective tip, making inside?” The bow-legged boy made his. He decided Jan nobleman disguise, his father duke, “jook,” he called him. Jan’s active imagination could quite resist influence romance, he lay awake night patching together hunchback’s reference nobs, incredulous glance dark-eyed gentleman given half pence, certainly nob himself. And never he leave house errand painter bow-legged boy burst forth, dish-cloth dirty boots hand, unexpected quarter, adjure “look jook.” It lovely afternoon when, his friend’s advice, Jan betook Park, nobs might opportunity recognizing wide-mouthed woman feared. He washed his face clean, brushed his old jacket trembling hands, bow-legged boy tied spotted scarf, given stableman mews opposite, round Jan’s neck he called “a gent’s knot,” poor child went seek his fate beating heart. There nobs enough. Round round came, monotony exhilarating amusement. The crowd great carriages crawled rather drove, Jan could see people well. Many lovely face, set soft frame delicate hue, caught his artistic eye, he watched recognized again. But passing glance languid curiosity met his eager gaze return. Not nob recognized him. But policeman looked he did, Jan crept away. When he got home, he found household matters standstill, bow-legged boy tearfully employed thinking Jan would despise his old friends “jook” acknowledged him, he become nob. And Jan set matters rights, he resolved he would go Park look relatives. CHAPTER XXXVI. THE MILLER’S LETTER.—A NEW POT BOILER SOLD. JAN happy, brief dream “jook” over, his heart clung his old home. If love care, tenderness sickness teaching health, parental qualities, he seek another parent Master Swift? And he foster-father he bound filial ties up-bringing infancy, common life, common trade, common joys sorrows past, could bind father? He begged bit paper painter, wrote letter Master Lake, would done credit schoolmaster’s instructions less blotted tears. He besought his foster-father betray Cheap Jack, he inquired tenderly schoolmaster Rufus. The windmiller great scholar, shown his reply:— “MY DEAR JAN, “Your welcome letter hand, I hope, dear Jan, It finds well leave present. I mortal bad cough, friends searched everywhere, dragged every place you, encluding plains twenty mile round watermill. That Cheap John vather mine, e’d better show his dirty vace yearabouts he stole. poor mother, she allus took him, she said her mouth, woman child’s mother, never wos mother, mother knowed wots wot, poor zowl! And I am glad, dear Jan, well genteel line, though I hope you would take mill; work slack, I am wot I wos, I miss Master Swift. He stroke left, confined house, I conclude, dear Jan, go rejoice his heart hear alive. I would main like see you, Jan, dear, sartin would he enquiring friends; I till deth loving vather, good, I shall not grudge finds better. “ABEL LAKE.” “P.S. I would main like see vace again, Jan, dear.” Jan sobbed bitterly reading postscript that, vain attempts console chaff, bow-legged boy wept sympathy. As painter, whole letter caught his capricious fancy he ever questioning Jan details his life out-of-the-world district purest breath heaven turned sails windmill, miller took payment his work “in kind.” “It must wonderful spot, Giotto,” said he; “and, I richer, we would go together, paint sunsets, see friends.” And he walked studio, revolving his new caprice, whilst Jan tried think thing likely bring money his master’s pocket long. Suddenly artist seized sketch lying near, and, turning over, began one side, questioning Jan he drew. “What old country wives dress yonder?—What wear mill?—Where light come round-house,” etc. Presently he flung Jan, and, answer boy’s cry admiration, growled, “Ay, ay. You must _you_ now, every after-touch mine spoil it. There hundreds men, Giotto, whose sketches good, paintings daubs. But sketches great men sell. The public likes canvas linseed oil money, small reputations concerned.” The sketch peep round-house. Jan, toll-dish hand, quaint business gravity, met dame raising her old back letting her sack gleanings, garrulous good-humor her blinking eyes withered face. “Chiaroscuro good,” dictated painter; “execution sketchy; coloring quiet, keeping place subject, pure. You know scene better I, work away, Giotto. Motto—’Will ye pay toll it, mother?’ Price twenty-five guineas. Take What is-his-name’s, sells we will go Arcadia, Giotto mio! The thought breezes quinine languid faculties!” Jan worked hard new “pot boiler.” The artist painted boy’s figure himself, Jan rest. The bow-legged boy stooped petticoat model old woman, murmuring intervals, “Oh, my, _is_ game!” and, painter left room, his grave speculations whether withered face dame good likeness his chubby cheeks made Jan laugh till he could hardly hold his palette. It done last, Jan took picture-dealer’s. The poor boy could hardly keep street picture-dealer lived. One afternoon, he hanging window, business gentleman came asked kindly his welfare. Jan half ashamed hope he told tale pot boiler. “And it?” said business gentleman, peering his spectacles. “Only painting, sir, design,” said January “And want much go see old home?” “I do, sir,” said January The business gentleman put his gold spectacles case, laid his hand Jan’s shoulder. “I much judge genius,” said he, “but it, live make fortune it, remember, boy, luxury money puts man’s power like luxury helping others.” With he stepped briskly picture-dealer’s. And half hour afterwards Jan burst painter’s studio, crying, “It is sold, sir!” “Sold!” shouted painter, boyish glee. “Hooray! Where is rascal Bob? Oh, I know! I sent beer. Giotto, dear fellow, I shooting-boots somewhere, find them, tourist’s knapsack, and”— But Jan started find boots, bow-legged boy, overheard news he left house, rushed street, his head down, crying, “It is sold! it is sold!” and, he ran, he jostled man white apron, carrying pot green paint area railings. “Wot’s sold?” said he, testily, he recovered his balance. “You painter, do not know?” said rosy-cheeked boy. “Oh, my! Wot’s sold? Why, I am sold, _it’s_ sold. That walable picter I wos purchase mansion Piccadilly.” And, feigning burst torrent tears, he darted round corner public-house. CHAPTER XXXVII. SUNSHINE AFTER STORM. IT wet morning. The heavy rain-clouds rolled plains, hanging side horizon instant must fall crush solid earth, passing away side dark, slanting veils shower; giving vast monotony wide field view strange interchange light shadow, gleam gloom, makes poetry plains. The rain passed. The gray mud chalk roads dried white dust almost beneath travellers’ feet came temporary shelter; brightest, tenderest smile, which, days, sun makes evening atonement his absence, shone sparkled, danced glowed windmill water-meads. It reopened flowers, drew fragrant answer meadow-sweet bay-leaved willow. It made birds sing, ploughboy whistle, old folk toddle gardens smell herbs. It cherished silent satisfaction bronze face Rufus resting his paws, lay Master Swift’s wan brow like aureole austere saint canonized, side gates Paradise. The simile inapt, coarse vigorous features schoolmaster refined peculiar nobleness which, perhaps, sharp tool suffering—used highest ends—can alone produce. And smile patience, like victor’s wreath, lay hot passions imperious temper struggled overcome. The schoolmaster paralyzed his lower limbs, he sat wheel-chair his devising, he could propel his hands. The agonizing anxiety suspense followed Jan’s disappearance broken down, end. Rufus still his housekeeper, woman village came give necessary help. “And ’most like waiting upon angel,” said she. This woman gone night, Master Swift sat his invalid chair little porch, he could touch convolvulus bells his hand, see old pupil his done towards “righting up” garden. It instance hardly earned grace patience he vex see sorely garden suffered his helplessness. Not without evening smile sunlight reflected Master Swift’s lips. Between fingers hand lying his lap lay Jan’s letter announce he artist coming cottage, intervals reading re-reading schoolmaster spouted poetry, Rufus wagged sedately sympathetic tail. “How fresh, O Lord, sweet clean Are Thy returns! even flowers spring; To which, besides demean, The late past frosts tributes pleasure bring. Grief melts away Like snow May, As cold thing.” And, waving his hand old manner towards glowing water-meadows, he went increasing emphasis:— “Who would thought shrivelled heart Could recovered greennesse?” Perhaps Rufus felt bound answer tone appeal it, perhaps strange sympathy, Master Swift, began already disturb him. He rose knocked hand letter lay his long nose, wandered restlessly about, settled his eyes towards garden-gate. The old man sat still. The evening breeze stirred his white hair, he drank scents drawn freshly field flowers rain, like balm him. As he sat up, his voice seemed recover old power, he clasped his hands together Jan’s letter, went on:— “And age I bud again, After many deaths I live write; I smell dew rain, And relish versing: O Light! It cannot That I he On Thy tempests fell night!” So far Mr. George Herbert; poem never finished, Rufus jumped cry, standing moment stiffened limbs, muffled whines, he could believe his glaring yellow eyes, he burst away tenfold impetus, dragged, tore, pulled, carried Jan schoolmaster’s feet. And painter walked away garden, stood looking long water-meadows. CHAPTER XXXVIII. A PAINTER’S EDUCATION.—MASTER CHUTER’S PORT.—A FAREWELL FEAST.—THE SLEEP OF THE JUST. “I HOPE, Jan,” said Master Swift, “that gentleman overlook want respect towards himself, consideration see face again.” “Do not distress speaking it, Mr. Swift,” said painter, taking his hand, sitting beside porch. As he returned artist’s friendly grasp, schoolmaster scanned his face old sharpness. “Sir,” said he, “I beg forgive freedom. I am rough man rough tongue, I could never teach speak feelings heart; I humbly thank you, sir, goodness boy.” “It is selfish kind goodness present, Mr. Swift, I fancy day obligation acquaintance side.” “Jan,” said schoolmaster, “take Rufus wi’ ye, run errand I telled ye. Rufus’ll carry basket.” When gone, he turned earnestly painter. “Sir, I am speaking ye ignorance anxiety. Ye want lad painter. Will he great painter? I am reminding ye’ll know better (though yourself, Jan tells you are grand artist), man may ambition love, talent art, yet without divine spark gods withhold. Sir, GOD forbid I undervalue pure pleasure even little gift; it is ill lad he much art keep thrifty trade—and _no more_.” The painter replied earnestly Master Swift spoken,— “Jan’s estimate weaker his judgment art will not be. I speak understanding ears, know I true feeling art, I tell I know enough know I shall never great painter; help put confidence assurance that, he lives, _Jan will_.” Deep emotion kept old man silent. It mixed feeling,—first, intense pride pleasure, pang disappointment. Had he first see genius child? Had he built upon one ambition himself,—the ambition training future great man? And another taken his office. “You look disappointed,” said artist. “It vile selfishness me, sir. I hoped boy’s gifts would I could trained hearth. It one wilful fancy, thwarted.” “Selfish I sure not!” said painter, hotly; “and benevolence thwarted sort punishment I do not know what, I believe nothing kind.” “You do not know, sir,” said old man, firmly. “Not I am speaking Lord’s general dealings. There tender, gentle souls, I know well, seem grow purer better desire eyes granted them; others whom, good, Father sees needful chasten end.” “My experience lies another direction,” said painter, impetuously. “With awe suppose indolent men, whose easy years self-indulgent life broken real calamity, look upon others whose heads blow falls blow, though existence hourly struggle towards perfection? There stagnant pools whose peace Angel never disturbs. Does GOD, takes pleasure perfecting saint pardoning sinner, forget us worth remembering?” “He forgets none us, dear sir,” said schoolmaster, “and He draws us Himself different times, different roads. I wanted child’s teacher, He chosen you, bless ye work.” The painter drove his hands his bushy hair, spoke vehemently before. “_I_ his teacher, you? My good friend, I least better judge makes painter’s education. Is man shows Giotto use brush, mix paint, called his teacher? No, teaching him, forsooth, he would learned anybody, everybody, nobody, somehow, anyhow, done well without. But man taught work matter principle, apart inclination (a lesson geniuses learn); man fostered love Nature him, spirit poetry,—qualities without draughtsmanship painting better be; man example precept led find satisfaction duty done, happiness simple pleasures domestic affections; man fixed high pure lessons his mind, susceptible age, foulest dens London could corrupt him; man whose beloved reverenced face would rise judgment he could ever hereafter degrade his art pander vice, mere trick workshop;—this man, Master Swift, painter’s schoolmaster!” Master Swift accustomed betray emotion, his nerves less strong been, self-control difficult; his horny hands he hid cheeks tears gratified pride would force way. He found voice speak, Rufus appeared gate one basket, followed Jan little innkeeper another. Why Master Chuter come, Jan looking particularly well satisfied, must explained. Whilst painter still gazing across water-meadows, Master Swift, soul hospitality, told Jan find shillings certain drawer, commissioned lay wherewithal evening meal. Jan anxiety connection duty intrusted him. Firstly, he well knew shillings schoolmaster must depend week’s living. Secondly, though his old friend’s all, sum inadequate provide meal Jan would liked set painter. At his age, children sensitive behalf grown-up friends, like maintain credit home. The provoking point Jan plenty pocket-money, he could supplied deficiencies, he dared; painter, besides buying outfit journey, liberally rewarded his work pot boiler. But Jan knew pride Master Swift’s heart well venture add half penny his money, spend half penny less all. It whilst he going anxious countenance towards village shop Master Chuter met open arms. The little innkeeper genuinely delighted see him; news his arrival spread, several old friends (including “Willum” Smith) waiting him, yardway Heart Oak. When innkeeper discovered Jan’s errand, he insisted packing prime cut bacon, new-laid eggs, bottle “crusty” old port, squires drank election dinners, take schoolmaster. Jan far glad seasonable addition feast suggest doubts acceptance; indeed, he ventured hint possible lack wine-glasses, Master Chuter quickly took, soon filled his basket ancient glasses bloated legs, clean table-cloth, forth. “We need not say thing glasses,” suggested Jan, drew near cottage. Master Chuter winked little eye buried his fat left cheek. “I knows schoolmaster, January He mortal proud; I would not offend he, sartinly not, January But Master Swift seen deal since left, he have tasted port before, he bad, he will take amiss old friend.” Master Chuter right. The schoolmaster thanked heartily, pressed remain. But little innkeeper, bustling round table professional solicitude, declined invitation. “I obliged ’ee same, Master Swift. But I hope I knows better manners intrude Jan now, let alone gentleman I shall pleasure waiting Heart Oak. There beds, sir, service Jan’s, well aired be. And I will proud show sign, sir, painted boy he infant, I may say. But I knowed un. Master Swift bear witness. ‘Mark words,’ says I, ‘the boy Jan ’most good sign-painter yet.’ And I think will. But knows best, sir.” “I feel quite convinced he will,” said painter, gravely. Whilst Master Chuter artist thus settled Jan’s career, he cooked eggs bacon; Master Swift propelled table, others (including Rufus) taken seats, innkeeper drew cork, dusted bottle-mouth, filled fat-legged wine-glasses; then, throwing parting glance arrangements table, he withdrew. Jan’s fears credit his home, his anxieties effect frugal living his old friends upon luxurious taste his new patron, needless. The artist delighted every thing, he said he never tasted food good eggs bacon, relished wine like cellar Heart Oak, he quite believed he said. In truth, none easily pleased artistic, wish so, since “we receive give,” happiness thing according mind bring it, imaginative people must advantage able put much rose color spectacles. Warmed good cheer, Master Swift discoursed vigorously old. With graphic power narration, commoner his class higher one, he entertained artist stories Jan’s childhood, gave vivid picture his first sight wood. He fail describe long blue coat, pig-switch, slate, he omit quote lines well described scene child-genius painting leaves. “Well I named Giotto!” said artist; “the shepherd boy drawing sand.” “If ye’d seen swineherd painting nature’s tints,” said Master Swift, pertinacious adherence his view things, always characteristic him, “I reckon you would thought he beat shepherd boy. Not I could pretend judge painting myself, sir; took _my_ mind inventive energy child. For maybe fifty men hundred thing, find tools, show way, five make materials find way themselves.” “Necessity’s mother invention,” said painter, smiling. “So say, sir,” said schoolmaster, smartly; “though, experience shiftlessness necessitous folk, I have tempted doubt truth proverb.” The painter laughed, thought widow, Master Swift added, “Necessity may _mother_ invention, sir, father must good head his shoulders.” The sun set, moon risen, dew mixed kindred rain-drops schoolmaster’s flowers, Jan painter bade good-by. For half hour past seemed painter he exhausted, spoke languidly. “Do not get till I come morning, Master Swift,” said Jan; “I will come early dress you.” Rufus walked gate, waved his tail Jan kissed his soft nose brow, he went back Master Swift lay his feet. The old man refused door shut, he propelled his chair porch again, lay looking stars. The moon set, night grew cold, Rufus tucked his nose deeper his fur, Master Swift close door. * * * * * The sun shining brightly Jan came back morning. It early. The convolvulus bells open, Rufus schoolmaster still slept. Jan’s footsteps roused Rufus, stretched yawned, Master Swift move, answer Jan’s passionate call upon his name. And peace beauty his countenance Jan saw he dead. But hour silent messenger come—whether midnight, cock-crow, morning—there none tell. CHAPTER XXXIX. GEORGE AGAIN.—THE PAINTER’S ADVICE.—“HOME BREWED” AT THE HEART OF OAK.—JAN CHANGES THE PAINTER’S MIND. Master Swift’s death great shock windmiller, frail health; Jan gave much time he could cheering his foster-father. He spending afternoon windmill, painter sketching old church water-meadows, met little bridge near Dame Datchett’s, strolled together Heart Oak. Master Chuter met door. “There letter you, Jan,” said he. “It Was brought young varment I knows well. He belongs keeps low public foot hill, he world like hudmedud, without usefulness un.” The letter dirty ill-written enough correspond innkeeper’s account origin. Misspellings omitted, ran thus:— “MASTER JAN FORD, “Sir,—If wants know come from, look belongs you, come public foot hill evening, pounds pocket open lips knows. But fair play, mind. Gearge bean’t vool looks, cart-horses will not draw un, sets police. Do not took cusnashun old rascal Cheap John. You may hold head high Squire yet, makes worth _One knows_. I always fond you, Jan, dear. Keep dark.” The painter decided accept invitation; George Sannel’s face loomed smoke dingy little kitchen, terrors his childhood seemed awake January The face looked worn hungry, alarmed; face miller’s man. In truth, he deserted his regiment, hiding; Jan his master knew nothing. If George’s face bore tokens change, he seemed otherwise old. Cunning stupidity, distrust obstinacy, joined unscrupulous greed, still marked his loutish attempts overreach. Indeed, his surly temper would brought conference abrupt end interference girl inn. She written letter him, seemed take interest his fate hardly likely he deserved. She acted mediator, artist disposed credit her assurance “Gearge know deal young gentleman, tell all,” her appearance picturesque. She good service, George began pursue his old policy mixing lies truth he told, calling account. Nor she daunted his threatening glances. “It manners use thee looking like that, Gearge Sannel,” said she, folding her arms defiant attitude, painter hastily committed memory. “Have not I give word gentleman he hear straight tale? And advantage tell it. You wants money, gentleman wants truth. It mortal use make tale, beyond annying gentleman.” Under pressure, therefore, George told he knew himself, he learned Cheap Jack’s wife, part purchase-money pot boiler his reward. Master Lake confirmed his account Jan’s first coming mill. He took liveliest interest his foster-son’s fate, he thought, artist, little “satisfaction” got trying trace Jan’s real parentage. It painter’s deliberate opinion, he impressed upon Jan, sat together Master Chuter’s parlor. “My dear Giotto, I hope building much hopes new home new relatives. If heard true, mother dead; and, father dead too, he basely deserted you. You make name, seek one; confer credit, ask it. And I do not say this, Giotto, make vain, recall responsibilities, dispel useless dreams. Believe me, boy, true mother, tender nurse infancy, sleeps sacred shadow dear old church. It part make her name, name respectable foster-father, famous own; render windmill highly celebrated Rembrandt’s, hang late laurels fame grave grand old schoolmaster. Ah! child, I know well ductile artistic nature takes shape early. The coloring childhood stains every painter’s canvas paints heart. You never call place home, Giotto, idyllic corner world!” It seen painter’s rose-colored spectacles still his nose. Every thing delighted him. He never weary sketching garrulous patriarchs snowy smocks rickety porches. He said age criticism quite delightful hear Daddy Angel say, “Ay, ay,” every thing; he waxed eloquent luxury one post day, one uncertain. But his highest flights approbation given home-brewed ale. That pure, refreshing beverage, sound strong heart oak be, quenched thirst certain stringency might hint sourness vulgar palate, had—so he said—destroyed ever his contentment malt liquor. He spoke Bass Allsopp “palatable tonics” “non-poisonous medicinal compounds.” And when, flourish hyperbole, he told Master Chuter’s guests nothing eat drink got London, took his word it; without suspicion satire Daddy Angel said, “The gen’leman look pretty middlin’ hearty too—con-sid’rin’.” It evident painter intention going away till pot boiler fund exhausted, Jan willing enough abide, especially Master Lake caught cold schoolmaster’s funeral, grateful his foster-son’s company care. Jan busy many ways. He Master Swift’s heir; old man’s illness nearly swallowed his savings, Jan’s legacy consisted books, furniture, gardening tools, Rufus, attached his new master wistful affection seemed say, “You belong good old times, I know loved him.” Jan moved schoolmaster’s chattels windmill, packed books take London. With he packed little old etching bought Cheap Jack. “It is good one,” said painter. “It is old Dutch artist. You see copy British Museum.” But Museum Jan first saw duplicate his old favorite. He nailing box one afternoon, humming he so,— “But I alone left pine, And sit beneath withy tree, For truth honesty gone”— painter came behind him. “Stop doleful strain, Giotto, I beg; you have painfully sentimental last day two.” “It is old song sing here, sir,” said January “Never mind song, you have doleful yourself, Giotto! I believe you are dissatisfied push search father. Is money want, child? Believe me, riches enough lie fingers miller’s thumb. Or want fashionable protector old artist?” “No, no, sir!” cried January “I never want leave you; it is money I want, but”— “Well, boy? Do not afraid.” “It is mother, sir,” said Jan, flushed cheeks. “My real mother, I mean. She did not desert me, sir; she died—when I born. I doubt nobody sees her grave, sir. Perhaps there is nobody would. I cannot thing her now, sir, I know; seems I hardly duty knowing she lies.” The painter’s hands already deep his loose pockets, which, jumbled chalk, india-rubber, bits wash-leather, cakes color, reed pens, penknife, drawing-pins, he brought balance his loose cash, became absorbed calculations. “Is box ready?” he asked. “We start to-morrow, mind. You right, I wrong; wish spare possible pain. I think duty risk possible pain. If rascally creatures stole London, police find them. Be content, Giotto; shall stand mother’s grave!” CHAPTER XL. D’ARCY SEES BOGY.—THE ACADEMY.—THE PAINTER’S PICTURE. THE Ammabys London. Amabel preferred country; she bore town she bore many things quite her taste, including painfully short petticoats, Mademoiselle, French governess. She garden square one morning, D’Arcy ran in. “O Amabel!” he cried, “I am glad you are alone! Whom think I have seen? The boy called Bogy. It must he; I have looked glass, oh, he _is_ like me!” “Where see him?” asked Amabel. “Well, know I have told I get early now?” “I wish would not tell me,” interrupted Amabel, “when know Mademoiselle will not let get till half-past eight. Oh, I wish going home week!” “I am sorry, Amabel, listen. I river, he sketching; oh, beautifully! I shall burn copies; I never draw like him. Amabel, he _awfully_ like me, he must near age. He is like people’s twin-brothers are, know. I wish he twin-brother!” “He could not twin-brother,” said Amabel, gravely; “he is gentleman.” “Well, he is exactly gentleman,” said D’Arcy. “However, I asked he sent his pictures Academy, he said no, his master does, artist he lives with. And he told his master’s name, number his pictures; I have brought catalogue, numbers 401, 402, 403. And going Academy afternoon, I have asked mamma ask Lady Louisa let come us. But do not say thing boy, I do not want known I early.” At moment Mademoiselle, looking garden upper window, hastened fetch Amabel indoors. * * * * * It three four of the clock afternoon, Academy crowded. The crush oppressive Lady Adelaide wanted go away, D’Arcy expressed wish see No. 401, D’Arcy’s wishes law his father, he struggled search picture, others followed him. And small crowd round dispersed, saw quite clearly. It painter’s _picture_. As spectators passed, spoke coloring draughtsmanship; mellow glow sunshine, which, faithful richness southern summers, carried also poetical hint air glory genius lives alone. To graceful figure Cimabue familiar, new group round picture saw shepherd lad. And if, spectators said, his eyes haunted room, ghosts must summoned haunt Mr. Ford’s client he gazed? “Mais c’est Monsieur D’Arcy!” screamed French governess. And Amabel said, “It is Bogy; he is got leaves.” Lady Adelaide quite composed. The likeness striking, her maternal eyes saw thousand points difference Giotto painting her son. “How odd!” she said. “I wonder sat Giotto? If he really boy Amabel thinks she saw wood, I think her Bogy model must wonderful child Mr. Ammaby telling about, painted sign inn his village; his father windmiller called Lake, and”— “Mamma! mamma!” cried D’Arcy, “papa ill.” The sound his son’s voice recalled Mr. Ford’s client consciousness; partial confused consciousness. He heard voices speaking heat, crush, etc., dream. He sure whether he carried led along. The painting longer him, mattered little. The shepherd boy’s eyes dark his own; look upward gaze, stirred every heart, pierced his moved years ago eyes color summer sky. To others pathos spoke yearning genius war fortune; Mr. Ford’s client brought back, past, words rang clearly his ears condolences crowd,— “You will remember promise, D’Arcy? You quite sure take home bury me? And call child father,—JAN?” CHAPTER XLI. THE DETECTIVE.—THE “JOOK.”—JAN STANDS BY HIS MOTHER’S GRAVE.—HIS AFTER HISTORY. AS he resolved, painter secured help police tracing Jan’s pedigree. He take bow-legged boy his confidence, young gentleman recognized detective officer he opened door him; he laid his finger his snub nose, wink intense satisfaction. On hearing story, detective expressed his opinion (founded acquaintance Sal) George’s pocket picked his companions, chance thieves fair; he finally proved his sagacity guess bringing pocket-book letter artist. With his mother’s letter (it written Moerdyk, her way England) them, Jan artist sitting, Mr. Ford’s client announced, Jan stood face face his father. The gentle reader willingly leave veil meeting, artist felt generous shame witness. With less delicacy, bow-legged boy lingered outside door, studio rang passionate cry,—“My son! son!”—he threw his green baize apron his head, crying, “The jook!” plunged downwards basement, she would tears sympathy amongst boots bottles. To say Lady Adelaide forgave past, received her husband’s son kindness, scant justice generous affection he received her. With pity her husband mingled painful astonishment he trusted her little; blow could never quite repaired, love rarely meets exact equivalent faith tenderness, she suffer alone. She went Jan his father visit Master Lake, her gracious thanks windmiller his care her step-son gave additional bitterness her husband’s memories windmill. It she first urged go Holland. Jan’s grandfather dead,—Mr. Ford’s client could make reparation there,—but cousin old wooden house belonged gave Jan many things his mother’s. Amongst book sketches herself, collection etchings her great-grandfather, Dutch artist; collection Jan found favorite his childhood. Did genius really take rise old artist etched willows he struggled rival slate-pencil? His mother’s sketches far inferior his own; loving faithful study nature showed, perhaps, too, fact chiefly gathered homely homelike scenes, level horizons gray skies, Jan felt sympathy stirred heart. His delight touched Lady Adelaide even moved his father. But personal inconvenience past, long habits suffering selfishness, blunted her sense grievous wrong done her husband’s gifted son. Nor alone! It her husband’s dead wife Lady Adelaide’s sympathies keenest,—the mother, like herself, child. Mr. Ford’s client went almost unwillingly his wife’s grave, side her old father’s bones rested. But Jan Lady Adelaide hastened thither, hand hand, painter’s pledge redeemed. Since old man died, little tended, weeds grew rank flowers planted. Jan threw neglected grave. “My poor mother!” he cried, almost bitterly. For moment full sense common wrong seemed overwhelm him, he shrank even Lady Adelaide. But when, kneeling beside him, she bent her face wind sighed among grass stalks could carry her words ears long dulled death,—“My _poor_ child! _I_ mother son!”—Jan’s heart turned back gush gratitude his good stepmother. He much reason grateful: then, many succeeding years, her training fitted take his place without awkwardness society, her tender care atoned (so she hoped) hardships past. The brotherly love Jan D’Arcy source great comfort her. Once threatened estrangement. It grown young men, believed he love Amabel. Jan prepared sacrifice (and Amabel) enthusiasm his brother, D’Arcy luckily discovered he playmate his childhood really suited other. It case. The conventionalities English society his rank part D’Arcy’s life, Amabel made distasteful hands Lady Craikshaw her energetic, straight-forward spirit continual revolt; least Jan’s merits her eyes his life was, he different rest people amongst she lived, interests pleasures common world fashion could neither give take away. Withheld sacrificing his affections his brother, Jan joined his father cut entail his property. “D’Arcy heir, sir,” he said. “I hope live well art, GOD forbid I disinherit Lady Adelaide’s son.” His great gift indeed bring fortune well fame hero. The Boys’ Home knows this. It generous patrons (it many!), first amongst must rank great painter sometimes presides annual festival, will not occasions pleasantly speak “an old boy.” More accurately entitled character bow-legged man-servant another artist,—Jan’s old master. These two live together, would find difficult say whether pride pleasure good luck old companion, never healed pain his loss, stronger feeling kindly hearts. Amabel her father’s heir, process time Jan became Squire, went back spend his life skies inspired his childhood. But his wife will not say she believes his true vocation miller, strong love windmills him, proud he his Miller’s Thumb. At one time Mr. Ammaby wished take his name arms, Jan decided keep his own. And name Fame writes her roll painters, old Squires Ammaby, name he bore he Child Windmill. CHAPTER XLII. CONCLUSION. A SOUTH-WEST wind blowing plains. It drives “messengers” sky, sails windmill, makes dead leaves dance upon graves. It much dispel evil effects foul smells noxious gases, commoner yet little village one might suppose. (But long time, see, since fever here.) It shows silver lining willow leaves little river, bends flowers grow one glowing mass—like gorgeous Eastern carpet—on Master Swift’s grave. It rocks Jan’s sign mid-air Heart Oak, Master Chuter waiting upon newly arrived guest. It man business. Long he promised try breezes plains he calls dyspepsia, artist calls “money-grubbing-on-the-brain,” he never could find leisure, serious attack obliged so. But moment painter could leave London, he alone. He said he knows Jan, amuses hear little innkeeper ramble anecdotes great painter’s childhood. “This ale fine,” says man business. “I never touch beer home. The painter married, say?” “He have married two year,” Master Chuter replies. “And say Miss Amabel partial child. He come here, sir, soon his father took him, he draad Miss Amabel’s old white horse her; butler told me, sir, hangs library now. It fit inn sign, sartinly, be, gentry whims, sir, Miss Amabel fine young lady. The Squire’s moral image she be; affable free, quite different her ladyship. Coffee, sir? No, sir? Dined, sir? It fine evening, sir, you would like see church. I would glad show you, myself, sir. Old Solomon got key.” In main street village even man business strolls. There hurrying atmosphere. It matter time find Old Solomon, time make hear he found, time find key he hears. But time money merchant now, he watches western sky patiently, made sleepy breeze. When last saunter shadow gray church tower, his eye caught mass color, springs high cross white marble, whose top flushed setting sun. It fine design workmanship, marks grave great man’s schoolmaster sleeps near his wife child. Hard by, Master Chuter shows “fever monument,” names Master Lake’s children. And then, Daddy Solomon fumbled door open, pass church. The east end restored, innkeeper says, Squire, advice his son-in-law. And turn look west window,—the new window, boast parish,—at even old Solomon strains his withered eyes sense pride. The man business stands Jan used sit. The unchanged faces look old window. But old window he looks at, new one. The glory setting sun illumines it, throws crimson lights vesture principal figure—like stains blood—upon pavement. “It Good Shepherd,” Master Chuter explains, his guest silent. The pale-faced, white-haired angels upper lights seem ablaze, Old Solomon cannot look them. “Them sheep beautiful,” whispers innkeeper; stranger heeds not. He reading inscription:— _To Glory GOD_, _And pious memory Abel_, _my dear foster-brother_: _I_, _who designed window_, _Dedicate it_. _HE shall gather lambs His arms_.
