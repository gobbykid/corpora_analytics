 JACKANAPES DADDY DARWIN'S DOVECOT AND OTHER STORIES "If I might buffet love, bound horse her favors, I could lay like butcher, sit like Jackanapes, never off!" KING HENRY V, Act 5, Scene 2. JACKANAPES CHAPTER I. Last noon beheld full lusty life, Last eve Beauty's circle proudly gay, The midnight brought signal sound strife, The morn marshalling arms--the day Battle's magnificently stern array! The thunder clouds close it, rent The earth covered thick clay, Which her clay shall cover, heaped pent, Rider horse:--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent. Their praise hymn'd loftier harps mine: Yet one would I select proud throng. ----to thee, thousands, And one ghastly gap make In his kind kindred, teach Forgetfuluess mercy sake; The Archangel's trump, glory's, must awake Those thirst for. --BYRON. Two Donkeys Geese lived Green, residents social standing lived houses round it. The houses names. Everybody's address was, "The Green," Postman people place knew family lived. As rest world, one rest world, he safe home his Goose Green? Moreover, stranger come lawful business, he might ask his way shop. Most inhabitants long-lived, early deaths (like little Miss Jessamine) exceptional; old people proud age, especially sexton, would ninety-nine come Martinmas, whose father remembered man carried arrows, boy, battle Flodden Field. The Grey Goose big Miss Jessamine elderly persons kept ages secret. Indeed, Miss Jessamine never mentioned one's age, recalled exact year anything happened. She said she taught bad manners "in mixed assembly." The Grey Goose also avoided dates, partly her brain, though intelligent, mathematical, computation beyond her. She never got farther "last Michaelmas," "the Michaelmas that," "the Michaelmas Michaelmas that." After her head, small, became confused, she said, "Ga, ga!" changed subject. But she remembered little Miss Jessamine, Miss Jessamine "conspicuous" hair. Her aunt, big Miss Jessamine, said her fault. The hair clean, abundant, glossy, would it, never looked like people's. And church, Saturday night's wash, shone like best brass fender Spring cleaning. In short, conspicuous, become young woman--especially church. Those worrying times altogether, Green used strange purposes. A political meeting held village Cobbler chair, speaker came stage coach town, wrecked bakers' shops, discussed price bread. He came second time, stage, people heard something meanwhile, keep Green. They took pond tried make swim, he could do, whole affair disturbing quiet peaceable fowls. After another man came, preached sermons Green, great many people went hear him; "trying times," folk ran hither thither comfort. And drill ploughboys Green, get ready fight French, teach goose-step! However, came end last, Bony sent St. Helena, ploughboys sent back plough. Everybody lived fear Bony days, especially naughty children, kept order day threats of, "Bony shall you," nightmares dark. They thought he Ogre cocked hat. The Grey Goose thought he fox, men England going red coats hunt him. It use argue point, she small head, one idea got room another. Besides, Grey Goose never saw Bony, children, rather spoilt terror him, Black Captain became effective Bogy hardened offenders. The Grey Goose remembered _his_ coming place perfectly. What he came she pretend know. It part parcel war bad times. He called Black Captain, partly himself, partly his wonderful black mare. Strange stories afloat far fast mare could go, her master's hand her mane he whispered her ear. Indeed, people thought might reckon lucky frying-pan fire, got certain well-known Gentleman Road protect us French. But that, course, made none less useful Johnson's Nurse, little Miss Johnsons naughty. "You leave crying minnit, Miss Jane, I will give right away horrid wicked officer. Jemima! look windy, please, see Black Cap'n's a-coming his horse carry away Miss Jane." And there, sure enough, Black Captain strode by, his sword clattering know whose head cut first. But he call Miss Jane time. He went Green, he came suddenly upon eldest Master Johnson, sitting puddle purpose, his new nankeen skeleton suit, young gentleman thought judgment overtaken last, abandoned howlings despair. His howls redoubled he clutched behind swung Black Captain's shoulder, five minutes his tears stanched, he playing officer's accoutrements. All Grey Goose saw her eyes, heard afterwards bad boy whining go back Black Captain ever since, showed hardened he was, nobody Bonaparte could expected good. But "trying times." It bad enough pickle large respectable family cried Black Captain; came little Miss Jessamine crying him, one felt sooner French landed done better. The big Miss Jessamine's objection he soldier, prejudice shared Green. "A soldier," speaker town observed, "is bloodthirsty, unsettled sort rascal; peaceable, home-loving, bread-winning citizen never conscientiously look brother, till he beaten his sword ploughshare, his spear pruning-hook." On hand truth Postman (an old soldier) said reply; sword cut way us many scrape bread-winners get us drive ploughshares fallows do not belong them. Indeed, whilst peaceful citizens prosperous chiefly means cotton, sugar, rise fall money-market (not speak salable matters opium, firearms, "black ivory"), disturbances apt arise India, Africa outlandish parts, fathers domestic race making fortunes families. And, matter, even Green, wish military leave us lurch, long fear French coming.[1] [Footnote 1: "'The political men declare war, generally commercial interests; nation thus embroiled neighbors soldier ... draws sword, command his country.... One word thy comparison military commercial persons. What manner men supplied Caffres firearms ammunition maintain savage deplorable wars? Assuredly military.... Cease then, thou would'st counted among just, vilify soldiers."--W. Napier, Lieut. General, _November_, 1851.] II To let Black Captain little Miss Jessamine, however, another matter. Her Aunt would hear it; then, crown all, appeared Captain's father think young lady good enough his son. Never affair clearly brought conclusion. But "trying times;" one moon-light night, Grey Goose sound asleep upon one leg, Green rudely shaken her thud horse's feet. "Ga, ga!" said she, putting leg, running away. By time she returned her place thing seen heard. The horse passed like shot. But next day, hurrying skurrying cackling early hour, white house black beams, Miss Jessamine lived. And sun low, shadows long grass Grey Goose felt ready run away sight her neck, little Miss Jane Johnson, her "particular friend" Clarinda, sat big oak-tree Green, Jane pinched Clarinda's little finger till she found she could keep secret, she told her confidence she heard Nurse Jemima Miss Jessamine's niece naughty girl, horrid wicked officer come her his black horse, carried her right away. "Will she never come back?" asked Clarinda. "Oh, no!" said Jane decidedly. "Bony never brings people back." "Not never more?" sobbed Clarinda, she weak-minded, could bear think Bony never, never let naughty people go home again. Next day Jane heard more. "He taken her Green?" "A Goose Green?" asked Clarinda. "No. A Gretna Green. Do not ask many questions, child," said Jane; who, tell, gave herself airs. Jane wrong one point. Miss Jessamine's niece come back, she her husband forgiven. The Grey Goose remembered well, Michaelmastide, Michaelmas Michaelmas Michaelmas--but ga, ga! What date matter? It autumn, harvest-time, everybody busy prophesying praying crops, young couple wandered lanes, got blackberries Miss Jessamine's celebrated crab blackberry jam, made guys bryony-wreaths, soul troubled his head them, except children, Postman. The children dogged Black Captain's footsteps (his bubble reputation Ogre burst), clamoring ride black mare. And Postman would go somewhat his postal way catch Captain's dark eye, show he forgotten salute officer. But "trying times." One afternoon black mare stepping gently grass, her head her master's shoulder, many children crowded her silky back she elephant menagerie; next afternoon she carried away, sword _sabre-tache_ clattering war-music her side, old Postman waiting them, rigid salutation, four cross roads. War bad times! It hard winter, big Miss Jessamine little Miss Jessamine (but she Mrs. Black-Captain now), lived economically might help poorer neighbors. They neither entertained went company, young lady always went village far _George Dragon_, air exercise, London Mail[2] came in. [Footnote 2: The Mail Coach distributed face land, like opening apocalyptic vials, heart-shaking news Trafalgar, Salamanca, Vittoria, Waterloo.... The grandest chapter experience, within whole Mail Coach service, occasions went London news Victory. Five years life worth paying privilege outside place. DE QUINCEY.] One day (it day following June) came earlier usual, young lady meet it. But crowd soon gathered round _George Dragon_, gaping see Mail Coach dressed flowers oak-leaves, guard wearing laurel wreath his royal livery. The ribbons decked horses stained flecked warmth foam pace come, pressed news Victory. Miss Jessamine sitting her niece oak-tree Green, Postman put newspaper silently her hand. Her niece turned quickly--"Is news?" "Do not agitate yourself, dear," said her aunt. "I read aloud, enjoy together; far comfortable method, love, go village, come home breath, snatched half news run." "I attention, dear aunt," said little lady, clasping her hands tightly her lap. Then Miss Jessamine read aloud--she proud her reading--and old soldier stood attention behind her, blending pride pity his face strange see:-- "DOWNING STREET, "_June_ 22, 1815, 1 A.M." "That is one morning," gasped Postman; "beg pardon, mum." But though he apologized, he could refrain echoing weighty word. "Glorious victory,"--"Two hundred pieces artillery,"--"Immense quantity ammunition,"--and forth. "The loss British Army upon occasion unfortunately severe. It possible make return killed wounded Major Percy left headquarters. The names officers killed wounded, far collected, annexed. "I honor----" "The list, aunt! Read list!" "My love--my darling--let us go and----" "No. Now! now!" To one thing supremely afflicted entitled sorrow--to obeyed--and yet last kindness people commonly them. But Miss Jessamine did. Steadying her voice, best she might, she read on, old soldier stood bareheaded hear first Roll Dead Waterloo, began Duke Brunswick, ended Ensign Brown.[3] Five-and-thirty British Captains fell asleep day bed Honor, Black Captain slept among them. [Footnote 3: "Brunswick's fated chieftain" fell Quatre Bras, day Waterloo, first (very imperfect) list, appeared newspapers day, begin his name, end Ensign Brown.] * * * * * There killed wounded war, returns reach Downing Street. Three days later, Captain's wife joined him, Miss Jessamine kneeling cradle orphan son, purple-red morsel humanity, conspicuously golden hair. "Will he live, Doctor?" "Live? GOD bless soul, madam! Look him! The young Jackanapes!" CHAPTER II. And he wandered away away With Nature, dear old Nurse. LONGFELLOW. The Grey Goose remembered quite well year Jackanapes began walk, year speckled hen first time her motherly life got patience she sitting. She rather proud eggs--they unusually large--but she never felt quite comfortable them; whether she used get cramp, got nest, season bad, what, she never could tell, every egg addled one, one hatch gave her trouble chick she ever reared. It fine, downy, bright yellow little thing, monstrous big nose feet, ungainly walk she knew instance her well-bred high-stepping family. And behavior, either quarrelsome moping, simply unlike rest. When chicks hopped cheeped Green mother's feet, solitary yellow one went waddling responsibility, cluck spreckled hen would, went play pond. It one day usual, hen fussing fuming it, Postman, going deliver letter Miss Jessamine's door, nearly knocked good lady herself, who, bursting house her cap her bonnet on, fell his arms, crying-- "Baby! Baby! Jackanapes! Jackanapes!" If Postman loved anything earth, he loved Captain's yellow-haired child, propping Miss Jessamine her door-post, he followed direction her trembling fingers made Green. Jackanapes start Postman nearly ten minutes. The world--the round green world oak tree it--was becoming interesting him. He tried, vigorously ineffectually, mount passing pig last time he taken walking; he encumbered nurse. Now he his master, might, courage energy, become master delightful, downy, dumpy, yellow thing, bobbing along green grass front him. Forward! Charge! He aimed well, grabbed it, feel delicious downiness dumpiness slipping his fingers he fell upon his face. "Quawk!" said yellow thing, wobbled sideways. It oblique movement enabled Jackanapes come it, bound Pond, therefore obliged come back line. He failed top-heaviness, his prey escaped sideways before, and, before, lost ground getting back direct road Pond. And Pond Postman found both, one yellow thing rocking safely ripples lie beyond duck-weed, washing his draggled frock tears, he tried sit upon Pond, would not hold him. CHAPTER III. ... If studious, copie fair time hath blurred, Redeem truth his jawes; souldier, Chase brave employments naked sword Throughout world. Fool not; may have, If dare try, glorious life, grave. * * * * * In brief, acquit thee bravely: play man. Look pleasures come, go. Defer least vertue: life's poore span Make ell, trifling thy woe. If thou ill, joy fades, pains. If well, pain doth fade, joy remains. GEORGE HERBERT. Young Mrs. Johnson, mother many, hardly knew pity more; Miss Jessamine her little ways her antimacassars rumpled young Jackanapes; boy himself, brought old maid. Oddly enough, she would probably pitied neither, Jackanapes girl. (One apt think works smoothest works highest ends, patience results friction.) That Father GOD, bade young men pure, maidens brave, greatly disturbed member his congregation, thought great preacher made slip tongue. "That girls purity, boys courage, would say, good Father?" "Nature done that," reply; "I meant I said." In good sooth, young maid better learning robuster virtues maidenliness move antimacassars. And robuster virtues require fresh air freedom. As, hand, Jackanapes (who boy's full share little beast young monkey his natural composition) none worse, his tender years, learning maidenliness--so far maidenliness means decency, pity, unselfishness pretty behavior. And due say he obedient boy, boy whose word could depended on, long his grandfather General came live Green. He obedient; he his great aunt told him. But--oh dear! oh dear!--the pranks he played, never entered her head forbid! It he put skeletons (frocks never suited him) he became friendly Master Tony Johnson, younger brother young gentleman sat puddle purpose. Tony enterprising, Jackanapes led nose. One summer's evening late, Miss Jessamine becoming anxious, Jackanapes presented ghastly face besmirched tears. He unusually subdued. "I am afraid," he sobbed; "if please, I am much afraid Tony Johnson's dying churchyard." Miss Jessamine beginning distracted, she smelt Jackanapes. "You naughty, naughty boys! Do mean tell you have smoking?" "Not pipes," urged Jackanapes; "upon honor, Aunty, pipes. Only segars like Mr. Johnson's! made brown paper very, little tobacco shop inside them." Whereupon, Miss Jessamine sent servant churchyard, found Tony Johnson lying tomb-stone, sick, ceased entertain hopes his recovery. If could possible "unpleasantness" could arise two amiable neighbors Miss Jessamine Mrs. Johnson--and still incredible paradox ladies may differ point agreed--that point admitted fact Tony Johnson "delicate," difference lay chiefly this: Mrs. Johnson said Tony delicate--meaning he finely strung, sensitive, properer subject pampering petting Jackanapes, that, consequently, Jackanapes blame leading Tony scrapes resulted his chilled, frightened, (most frequently) sick. But Miss Jessamine said Tony Johnson delicate, she meant he puling, less manly, less healthily brought Jackanapes, who, got mischief together, certainly blame his friend could get wet, sit kicking donkey, ride giddy-go-round, bear noise cracker, smoke brown paper impunity, he could. Not ever slightest quarrel ladies. It never even came near it, except day Tony sick riding Bucephalus giddy-go-round. Mrs. Johnson explained Miss Jessamine reason Tony easily upset, unusual sensitiveness (as doctor explained her) nervous centres her family--"Fiddlestick!" So Mrs. Johnson understood Miss Jessamine say, appeared she said "Treaclestick!" quite another thing, Tony undoubtedly fond. It fair Tony made ill riding Bucephalus. Once year Goose Green became scene carnival. First all, carts caravans rumbling along, day night. Jackanapes could hear he lay bed, could hardly sleep speculating booths whirligigs he find fairly established; he his dog Spitfire went breakfast. As matter fact, he seldom wait long news Fair. The Postman knew window Jackanapes' yellow head would come, ready his report. "Royal Theayter, Master Jackanapes, old place, careful seats, sir; they are rickettier ever. Two sweets ginger-beer oak tree, Flying Boats a-coming along road." No doubt partly he already suffered severely Flying Boats, Tony collapsed quickly giddy-go-round. He mounted Bucephalus (who spotted, tail) Jackanapes urged him, held ingenious hope round-and-round feeling would likely cure up-and-down sensation. It not, however, Tony tumbled first revolution. Jackanapes absolutely free qualms, mounted Black Prince he stuck horseman should. During first round he waved his hat, observed concern Black Prince lost ear since last Fair; second, he looked little pale sat upright, though somewhat unnecessarily rigid; third round he shut his eyes. During fourth his hat fell off, he clasped his horse's neck. By fifth he laid his yellow head Black Prince's mane, clung anyhow till hobby-horses stopped, proprietor assisted alight, he sat rather suddenly said he enjoyed much. The Grey Goose always ran away first approach caravans, never came back Green till nothing left Fair footmarks oyster-shells. Running away her pet principle; system, she maintained, live long easily, lose nothing. If run away see danger, come back safe. Run quickly, return slowly, hold head high, gabble loud can, you will preserve respect Goose Green peaceful old age. Why struggle get hurt, lower head swerve, lose feather? Why world one spoil pleasure life, risk his skin, he help it? "'What is use' Said Goose." Before answering one might consider world--which life--whether his skin goose-skin; Grey Goose's head would never held that. Grass soon grows footprints, village children took oyster-shells trim gardens with; year Tony rode Bucephalus lingered another relic Fairtime, Jackanapes deeply interested. "The Green" proper originally part straggling common, turn merged wilder waste land gipsies sometimes squatted authorities would allow them, especially annual Fair. And Fair Jackanapes, rambling himself, knocked Gipsy's son riding Gipsy's red-haired pony break-neck pace across common. Jackanapes got shook himself, none worse, except heels head love red-haired pony. What rate he went at! How he spurned ground his nimble feet! How his red coat shone sunshine! And bright eyes peeped his dark forelock blown wind! The Gipsy boy fright, he willing enough reward Jackanapes hurt, consenting let ride. "Do mean kill little fine gentleman, swing us gibbet, rascal?" screamed Gipsy-mother, came Jackanapes pony set off. "He would get on," replied her son. "It will kill him. He will fall his yellow head, it is tough cocoanut." But Jackanapes fall. He stuck red-haired pony he stuck hobbyhorse; oh, different delight wild gallop flesh blood! Just his legs beginning feel he feel them, Gipsy boy cried "Lollo!" Round went pony unceremoniously, that, little ceremony, Jackanapes clung his neck, he properly recover Lollo stopped jerk place started. "Is his name Lollo?" asked Jackanapes, his hand lingering wiry mane. "Yes." "What Lollo mean?" "Red." "Is Lollo pony?" "No. My father's." And Gipsy boy led Lollo away. At first opportunity Jackanapes stole away common. This time he saw Gipsy-father, smoking dirty pipe. "Lollo pony, is not he?" said Jackanapes. "Yes." "He is nice one." "He is racer." "You do not want sell him, you?" "Fifteen pounds," said Gipsy-father; Jackanapes sighed went home again. That afternoon he Tony rode two donkeys, Tony managed get thrown, even Jackanapes' donkey kicked. But jolting, clumsy work elastic swiftness dainty mischief red-haired pony. A days later Miss Jessamine spoke seriously Jackanapes. She good deal agitated she told his grandfather, General, coming Green, he must his best behavior visit. If feasible leave calling Jackanapes get used his baptismal name Theodore day to-morrow (when General due), would satisfactory. But Miss Jessamine feared would impossible practice, she scruples principle. It would seem quite truthful, although she always fully intended he called Theodore he outgrown ridiculous appropriateness his nickname. The fact he outgrown it, he must take care remember meant his grandfather said Theodore. Indeed matter he must take care along. "You apt giddy, Jackanapes," said Miss Jessamine. "Yes aunt," said Jackanapes, thinking hobby-horses. "You good boy, Jackanapes. Thank GOD, I tell grandfather that. An obedient boy, honorable boy, kind-hearted boy. But are--in short, _are_ Boy, Jackanapes. And I hope,"--added Miss Jessamine, desperate results experience--"that General knows Boys Boys." What mischief could foreseen, Jackanapes promised guard against. He keep his clothes his hands clean, look his catechism, put sticky things his pockets, keep hair his smooth--("It is wind blows it, Aunty," said Jackanapes--"I will send coach bear's-grease," said Miss Jessamine, tying knot her pocket-handkerchief)--not burst parlor door, talk top his voice, crumple his Sunday frill, sit quite quiet sermon, sure say "sir" General, careful rubbing his shoes doormat, bring his lesson-books his aunt she might iron dogs' ears. The General arrived, first day went well, except Jackanapes' hair wild usual, hair-dresser bear's-grease left. He began feel ease his grandfather, disposed talk confidentially him, he Postman. All General felt would take long tell, result same. He disposed talk confidentially Jackanapes. "Mons'ous pretty place this," he said, looking lattice Green, grass vivid sunset, shadows long peaceful. "You see Fair-week, sir," said Jackanapes, shaking his yellow mop, leaning back his one two Chippendale armchairs sat. "A fine time that, eh?" said General, twinkle his left eye. (The glass.) Jackanapes shook his hair more. "I enjoyed last one best all," he said. "I would much money." "By George, it is common complaint bad times. How much ye?" "I would two shillings. A new shilling Aunty gave me, elevenpence I saved up, penny Postman--_sir_!" added Jackanapes jerk, forgotten it. "And ye spend it--_sir_?" inquired General. Jackanapes spread his ten fingers arms his chair, shut his eyes he might count conscientiously. "Watch-stand Aunty, threepence. Trumpet myself, twopence, that is fivepence. Ginger-nuts Tony, twopence, mug Grenadier Postman, fourpence, that is elevenpence. Shooting-gallery penny, that is shilling. Giddy-go-round, penny, that is one penny. Treating Tony, one twopence. Flying Boats (Tony paid himself), penny, one threepence. Shooting-gallery again, one four-pence; Fat Woman penny, one fivepence. Giddy-go-round again, one sixpence. Shooting-gallery, one sevenpence. Treating Tony, he would not shoot, I did, one eightpence. Living Skeleton, penny--no, Tony treated me, Living Skeleton does not count. Skittles, penny, one ninepence Mermaid (but got inside she dead), penny, one tenpence. Theatre, penny (Priscilla Partington, Green Lane Murder. A beautiful young lady, sir, pink cheeks real pistol), that is one elevenpence. Ginger beer, penny (I _was_ thirsty!) two shillings. And Shooting-gallery man gave turn nothing, because, he said, I real gentleman, spent money like man." "So do, sir, do!" cried General. "Why, sir, spend like prince--And I suppose you have got penny pocket?" "Yes I have," said Jackanapes. "Two pennies. They saving up." And Jackanapes jingled his hand. "You do not want money except fair-times, I suppose?" said General. Jackanapes shook his mop. "If I could much I want, I know buy," said he. "And much want, could get it?" "Wait minute, sir, till I think twopence fifteen pounds leaves. Two nothing cannot, borrow twelve. Two twelve, ten, carry one. Please remember ten, sir, I ask you. One nothing cannot, borrow twenty. One twenty, nineteen, carry one. One fifteen, fourteen. Fourteen pounds nineteen and--what I tell remember?" "Ten," said General. "Fourteen pounds nineteen shillings ten-pence then, I want," said Jackanapes. "Bless soul, for?" "To buy Lollo with. Lollo means red, sir. The Gipsy's red-haired pony, sir. Oh, he beautiful! You see his coat sunshine! You see his mane! You see his tail! Such little feet, sir, go like lightning! Such dear face, too, eyes like mouse! But he is racer, Gipsy wants fifteen pounds him." "If he is racer, could not ride him. Could you?" "No--o, sir, I stick him. I day." "You did, you? Well, I am fond riding myself, beast good say, he might suit me." "You are tall Lollo, I think," said Jackanapes, measuring his grandfather his eye. "I double legs, I suppose. We will look to-morrow." "Do not weigh good deal?" asked Jackanapes. "Chiefly waistcoats," said General, slapping breast his military frock-coat. "We will little racer Green first thing morning. Glad mentioned it, grandson. Glad mentioned it." The General good his word. Next morning Gipsy Lollo, Miss Jessamine, Jackanapes his grandfather his dog Spitfire, gathered one end Green group, aroused innocent curiosity Mrs. Johnson, she saw one her upper windows, she children took early promenade rather earlier usual. The General talked Gipsy, Jackanapes fondled Lollo's mane, know whether he glad miserable his grandfather bought him. "Jackanapes!" "Yes, sir!" "I have bought Lollo, I believe right. He hardly stands high enough me. If ride end Green, I will give you." How Jackanapes tumbled Lollo's back he never knew. He gathered reins Gipsy-father took arm. "If want make Lollo go fast, little gentleman--" "_I_ make go!" said Jackanapes, drawing his pocket trumpet he bought fair, he blew blast loud shrill. Away went Lollo, away went Jackanapes' hat. His golden hair flew out, aureole his cheeks shone red distended trumpeting. Away went Spitfire, mad rapture race, wind his silky ears. Away went geese, cocks, hens, whole family Johnson. Lucy clung her mamma, Jane saved Emily gathers her gown, Tony saved somersault. The Grey Goose returning Jackanapes Lollo rode back, Spitfire panting behind. "Good, little gentleman, good!" said Gipsy. "You born saddle. You have flat thigh, strong knee, wiry back, light caressing hand, want learn whisper Come here!" "What dirty fellow talking about, grandson?" asked General. "I cannot tell you, sir. It is secret." They sitting window again, two Chippendale arm-chairs, General devouring every line his grandson's face, strange spasms crossing his own. "You must love aunt much, Jackanapes?" "I do, sir," said Jackanapes warmly. "And love next best aunt?" The ties blood pressing strongly General himself, perhaps he thought Lollo. But Love bought day, even fourteen pounds nineteen shillings ten-pence. Jackanapes answered quite readily, "The Postman." "Why Postman?" "He knew father," said Jackanapes, "and he tells him, his black mare. My father soldier, brave soldier. He died Waterloo. When I grow I want soldier too." "So shall, boy. So shall." "Thank you, grandfather. Aunty does not want soldier fear killed." "Bless life! Would she get feather-bed stay there? Why, might killed thunderbolt, butter-merchant!" "So I might. I shall tell her so. What funny fellow are, sir! I say, think father knew Gipsy's secret? The Postman says he used whisper his black mare." "Your father taught ride child, one horsemen East swoop dart wheel plain like swallows autumn. Grandson! Love little too. I tell father Postman can." "I love you," said Jackanapes. "Before came I frightened. I would notion nice." "Love always, boy, whatever I leave undone. And--God help me--whatever leave undone, I will love you! There shall never cloud us day; no, sir, hour. We are imperfect enough, us, need not bitter; life uncertain enough safest, need not waste opportunities. Look me! Here sit I, dozen battles worst climates world, yonder lych gate lies mother, did not move five miles, I suppose, aunt's apron-strings,--dead her teens; golden-haired daughter, I never saw." Jackanapes terribly troubled. "Do not cry, grandfather," he pleaded, his blue eyes round tears. "I love much, I try good. But I like soldier." "You shall, boy, shall. You have claims commission know of. Cavalry, I suppose; eh, ye young Jackanapes? Well, well; live honor country, old heart shall grow young pride you; die service country--GOD bless me, break ye!" And beating region he said waistcoats, stifled him, old man got strode Green. CHAPTER IV. "Greater love hath man this, man lay his life his friends."--JOHN XV. 13. Twenty odd years later Grey Goose still alive, full possession her faculties, were. She lived slowly carefully, she lived long. So Miss Jessamine; General dead. He lived Green many years, he Postman saluted punctiliousness almost drilled one witness. He would completely spoiled Jackanapes Miss Jessamine's conscience would let him; otherwise he somewhat dragooned his neighbors, positive parish matters ratepayer army. A stormy-tempered, tender-hearted soldier, irritable suffering wounds he never spoke, village followed his grave tears. The General's death great shock Miss Jessamine, her nephew stayed her little time funeral. Then he obliged join his regiment, ordered abroad. One effect conquest General gained affections village, considerable abatement popular prejudice "the military." Indeed village somewhat importantly represented army. There General himself, Postman, Black Captain's tablet church, Jackanapes, Tony Johnson, Trumpeter. Tony Johnson natural taste fighting riding, he devoted ever Jackanapes, came Mr. Johnson bought commission cavalry regiment General's grandson (whose commission given Iron Duke) in, he quite content butt mess Jackanapes hero; Jackanapes wrote home Miss Jessamine, Tony wrote purpose his mother; namely, demand her congratulations active service last, ordered front. And he added postscript effect she could idea popular Jackanapes was, splendidly he rode wonderful red charger he named his old friend Lollo. * * * * * "Sound Retire!" A Boy Trumpeter, grave weight responsibilities accoutrements beyond his years, stained, his mother would known him, sweat dust battle, he bid; pushing his trumpet pettishly aside, adjusted his weary legs hundredth time horse world big him, muttering, "'Tain't pretty tune," tried see something this, his first engagement, came end. Being literally thick it, he could hardly seen less known less happened particular skirmish he home England. For many good reasons; including dust smoke, attention he dared distract his commanding officer pretty well absorbed keeping his hard-mouthed troop-horse hand, pain execration his neighbors melée. By-and-by, newspapers came out, he could get look one thumbed bits, he would learn enemy appeared ambush overwhelming numbers, orders given fall back, done slowly good order, men fighting retired. Born bred Goose Green, youngest Mr. Johnson's gardener's numerous off-spring, boy given his family "no peace" till let "go soldier" Master Tony Master Jackanapes. They consented last, tears she would elder son sent jail poaching, boy perfectly happy his life, full _esprit de corps_. It wounded sound retreat "the young gentlemen's regiment," first time he served enemy, he also harassed completely lost sight Master Tony. There hard fighting backward movement began, he caught sight once, since. On hand, pulses his village pride stirred one two visions Master Jackanapes whirling his wonderful horse. He easy distinguish, since eccentric blow bared his head without hurting it, his close golden mop hair gleamed hot sunshine brightly steel sword flashing round it. Of missiles fell pretty thickly, Boy Trumpeter take much notice. First, one cannot attend everything, his hands full. Secondly, one gets used anything. Thirdly, experience soon teaches one, spite proverbs, bullets find billet. Far unnerving mere suspicion fear even anxiety human mass around you. The Boy beginning wonder dark reason increasing pressure, whether would allowed move back quickly, smoke front lifted moment, he could see plain, enemy's line two hundred yards away. And across plain them, he saw Master Jackanapes galloping alone top Lollo's speed, faces enemy, his golden head Lollo's ear. But moment noise smoke seemed burst every side, officer shouted sound retire, trumpeting bumping his horse, he saw heard incidents his first battle. Tony Johnson always unlucky horses, days giddy-go-round onwards. On day--of days year--his horse sick list, he ride inferior, ill-conditioned beast, fell that, moment matter life death able ride away. The horse fell him, struggled again, Tony managed keep hold it. It trying remount he discovered, helplessness anguish, one his legs crushed broken, feat he master would get saddle. Not able even stand alone, awkwardly, agonizingly unable mount his restive horse, his life yet strong within him! And one side rolled dust smoke-cloud his advancing foe, other, covered his retreating friends. He turned one piteous gaze them, bitter twinge, reproach, loneliness; then, dragging side his horse, he turned way drew his pistol, waited end. Whether he waited seconds minutes he never knew, one gripped arm. "Jackanapes! GOD bless you! It is left leg. If could get on--" It like Tony's luck his pistol went his horse's tail, made plunge; Jackanapes threw across saddle. "Hold anyhow, stick spur in. I will lead him. Keep head down, they are firing high." And Jackanapes laid his head down--to Lollo's ear. It fairly off, sudden upspringing enemy directions made necessary change gradual retirement force rapid retreat possible. And Jackanapes became aware this, felt lagging swerving Tony's horse, he began wish he thrown his friend across his saddle, left lives Lollo. When Tony became aware it, several things came his head. 1. That dangers ride life doubled. 2. That Jackanapes Lollo burdened would undoubtedly escape. 3. That Jackanapes' life infinitely valuable, his--Tony's--was not. 4. That this--if he could seize it--was supremest moments he tried assume virtues Jackanapes nature; he could courageous unselfish now-- He caught his reins spoke loud-- "Jackanapes! It will not do. You Lollo must go on. Tell fellows I gave back them, heart. Jackanapes, love me, leave me!" There daffodil light evening sky front them, shone strangely Jackanapes' hair face. He turned odd look his eyes vainer man Tony Johnson might taken brotherly pride. Then he shook his mop laughed him. "_Leave you?_ To save skin? No, Tony, save soul!" CHAPTER V. Mr. VALIANT _summoned. His will. His last words._ Then, said he, "I going Father's.... My Sword I give shall succeed Pilgrimage, Courage Skill get it." ... And he went deeper, he said, "Grave, thy Victory?" So he passed over, Trumpets sounded side. BUNYAN'S _Pilgrim's, Progress_. Coming hospital-tent, headquarters, surgeon cannonaded against, rebounded from, another officer; sallow man, young, face worn ungentle experiences age; weary eyes kept counsel, iron gray hair, moustache raven laid wing across his lips sealed them. "Well?" "Beg pardon, Major. Did not see you. Oh, compound fracture bruises, it is right. He will pull through." "Thank GOD." It probably involuntary expression, prayer praise much Major's line, jerk surgeon's head would betrayed observer. He bright little man, his feelings showing him, gallantry contempt death enough sides his profession; took cool head, white handkerchief case instruments, men went hot-blooded weapons, biggest gossip, male female, regiment. Not even Major's taciturnity daunted him. "Did not think he would much pluck he has. He will right he does not fret fever poor Jackanapes." "Whom talking about?" asked Major hoarsely. "Young Johnson. He--" "What Jackanapes?" "Do not know? Sad business. Rode back Johnson, brought in; but, monstrous ill-luck, hit rode. Left lung--" "Will he recover?" "No. Sad business." "What frame--what limbs--what health--and good looks? Finest young fellow--" "Where he?" "In his tent," said surgeon sadly. The Major wheeled left him. * * * * * "Can I anything else you?" "Nothing, thank you. Except--Major! I wish I could get appreciate Johnson." "This easy moment, Jackanapes." "Let tell you, sir--_he_ never will--that he could driven him, he would lying yonder moment, I safe sound." The Major laid his hand his mouth, keep back wish he would ashamed utter. "I have known old Tony child. He is fool impulse, good man gentleman principle. And he acts principle, it is every--some water, please! Thank you, sir. It is hot, yet one's feet get uncommonly cold. Oh, thank you, thank you. He is fire-eater, he trained conscience tender heart, he will his duty braver selfish man might fail you. But he wants encouragement; I am gone----" "He shall encouragement. You word it. Can I nothing else?" "Yes, Major. A favor." "Thank you, Jackanapes." "Be Lollo's master, love well can. He is used it." "Would not rather Johnson him?" The blue eyes twinkled spite mortal pain. "Tony _rides_ principle, Major. His legs bolsters, end chapter. I could not insult dear Lollo, do not care----" "Whilst I live----which longer I desire deserve----Lollo shall want nothing, but----you. I little tenderness for----my dear boy, you are faint. Can spare moment?" "No, stay--Major!" "What? What?" "My head drifts so--if would not mind." "Yes! Yes!" "Say prayer me. Out loud please, I getting deaf." "My dearest Jackanapes--my dear boy----" "One Church Prayers--Parade Service, know----" "I see. But fact is--GOD forgive me, Jackanapes--I am different sort fellow youngsters. Look here, let fetch--" But Jackanapes' hand his, would not let go. There brief bitter silence. "'Pon soul I remember little one end." "Please," whispered Jackanapes. Pressed conviction little he could his duty do, Major--kneeling--bared his head, spoke loudly, clearly, reverently-- "The Grace Lord Jesus Christ--" Jackanapes moved his left hand his right one, still held Major's-- "--The love GOD." And that--Jackanapes died. CHAPTER VI. "Und ist der blaue Himmel grösser als jedes Gewolk darin, und dauerhafter dazu." JEAN PAUL RICHTER. Jackanapes' death sad news Goose Green, sorrow justly qualified honorable pride his gallantry devotion. Only Cobbler dissented, his way. He said he saw nothing foolhardiness vainglory. They might killed, easy not, would ye been? A man's life man's life, one life good another. No one would catch throwing his away. And, matter, Mrs. Johnson could spare child great deal better Miss Jessamine. But parson preached Jackanapes' funeral sermon text, "Whosoever save his life shall lose it; whosoever lose his life My sake shall find it;" village went wept hear him. Nor Miss Jessamine see her loss Cobbler's point view. On contrary, Mrs. Johnson said she never her dying day forget how, she went condole her, old lady came forward, gentle-womanly self-control, kissed her, thanked GOD her dear nephew's effort blessed success, sad war made gap her friend's large happy home circle. "But she is noble, unselfish woman," sobbed Mrs. Johnson, "and she taught Jackanapes same, that is Tony spared me. And must sheer goodness Miss Jessamine, she know mother's feelings? And I am sure people seem think you have large family do not know one another do, lot children like lot store-apples, one's taken will not missed." Lollo--the first Lollo, Gipsy's Lollo--very aged, draws Miss Jessamine's bath-chair slowly Goose Green sunshine. The Ex-postman walks beside him, Lollo tolerates level his shoulder. If Postman advances nearer his head, Lollo quickens his pace, Postman persist injudicious attempt, is, Miss Jessamine says, knowing might happen. In opinion Goose Green, Miss Jessamine borne her troubles "wonderfully." Indeed, to-day, less delicate less intimate see everything upper windows, say (well behind her back) "the old lady seems quite lively her military beaux again." The meaning is, Captain Johnson leaning one side her chair, whilst bends brother officer staying him, manifested extraordinary interest Lollo. He bends lower lower, Miss Jessamine calls Postman request Lollo kind enough stop, whilst she fumbling something always hangs her side, got entangled her spectacles. It two-penny trumpet, bought years ago village fair, she Captain Johnson tell, best can, them, story Jackanapes' ride across Goose Green; he Lollo--the Gipsy's Lollo--the racer Lollo--dear Lollo--faithful Lollo--Lollo never vanquished--Lollo tender servant his old mistress.

Early summer, late afternoon; odors colors deepening, shadows lengthening, towards evening. Two gaffers gossiping, seated side side upon Yorkshire wall. A wall sandstone many colors, glowing redder yellower sun goes down; well cushioned moss lichen, deep set rank grass side, path runs, blue hyacinths side, wood is, where--on gray still naked branches young oaks--sit divers crows, less solemn gaffers, also gossiping. One gaffer work-day clothes, unpicturesque form hue. Gray, home-knit stockings, coat knee-breeches corduroy, takes tints Time Weather harmoniously wooden palings do; field laborers (like insects) seem absorb mimic colors vegetation round native soil. That is, work-days. Sunday-best different matter, gaffer clothed. He dressed like crows him, _fit excepted_: reason was, he visitor, revisitor home his youth, wore his Sunday (and funeral) suit mark holiday. Continuing path, stone pack-horse track, leading past hedge snow-white may, little wood, depths one could hear brook babbling. Then across sunny field beyond, yet another field brow hill crowned old farm-buildings standing sky. Down stone path young man going whistling home tea. Then staying bend swarthy face white may smell it, plucking huge branch blossom lies like heavy fall snow, throwing aside better, tearing another yet another, prodigal recklessness pauper; so, whistling, wood his arms full. Down sunny field, he goes it, woman coming meet him--with _her_ arms full. Filled child may-white frock, hair shining warm colors sandstone. A young woman, fair forehead visible long way off, buxom cheeks, steadfast eyes. When meet he kisses her, she pulls his dark hair smooths her own, cuffs country fashion. Then change burdens, she takes may her apron (stooping pick fallen bits), child sits man's shoulder, cuffs lugs father mother did, chidden her kissed him. And babbling chiding crowing laughter comes across babbling brook ears old gaffers gossiping wall. Gaffer I. spits over-munched stalk meadow soft-grass, speaks: "D'ye see yon chap?" Gaffer II. takes his hat wipes round spotted handkerchief (for Sunday hat heating thing work-day wear), puts on, makes reply: "Aye. But he beats me. And--see there!--he is t'first that is beat yet. Why, lad! I have met young chaps to-day I could ha' sworn mates mine forty years back--if I had not ha' i't' churchyard spelling fathers' tumstuns!" "Aye. There is many old standards gone home lately." "What call _him?_" "T' young chap?" "Aye." "They _call_ him--Darwin." "Dar--win? I known Darwin. They are old standards, Darwins. What is he Daddy Darwin t' Dovecot yonder?" "He _owns_ t' Dovecot. Did ye see t' lass?" "Aye. Shoo's his missus, I reckon?" "Aye." "What call her?" "Phoebe Shaw called her. And she would _my_ lass--but that is nother there, he is got t' Dovecot." "Shaw? _They're_ old standards, Shaws. Phoebe? They called her mother Phoebe. Phoebe Johnson. She dainty lass! My father fond Phoebe Johnson. He said she allus put i' mind orchard drying days; pink white apple-blossom clean clothes. And yon's her daughter? Where d'ye say t'young chap come from? He do not look like hereabouts." "He do not come hereabouts. And yet he come hereabouts, one may say. Look ye here. He come t' wukhus. That is short long it." "_The workhouse!_" "Aye." Stupefaction. The crows chattering wildly overhead. "And he owns Darwin's Dovecot?" "He owns Darwin's Dovecot." "And i' t' name things come about'!" "Why, I will tell thee. It i' fashion." * * * * * Not without reason wary writer put gossip mouths gaffers rather gammers. Male gossips love scandal dearly female gossips do, bring stronger relish energies sex. But country gaffers, whose speech--like shadows--grows lengthy leisurely hours eventide. The gentle reader shall tale plain narration. NOTE--It plain reader birds described Rooks (_corvus frugilegus_). I allowed speak generic family name Crow, common country practice. The genus _corvus_, _Crow_, includes Raven, Carrion Crow, Hooded Crow, Jackdaw, Rook. SCENE I. One Saturday night (some eighteen years earlier date gaffer-gossiping) parson's daughter sat her room open drawer bandy-legged black oak table, _balancing her bags_. The bags money-bags, matter shall made clear once. In parish, others, progress multiplication weapons civilization powers goodness push conquests brutality powers evil, added original duties parish priest, multifarious impracticable variety offices; which, ordinary late conditions, would performed several less salaried clerks, bankers, accountants, secretaries, librarians, club-committees, teachers, lecturers, discount ready-money dealers clothing, boots, blankets, coal, domestic-servant agencies, caterers public amusement, preservers public peace. The country parson (no less statesmen princes, men science letters) responsible great deal his work really done help-mate--woman. This explains five young lady's moneybags bore following inscriptions marking-ink: "Savings' bank," "Clothing club," "Library," "Magazines hymn-books," "Three-halfpenny club"--and three bore reference private funds, as--"House-money"--"Allowance "--"Charity." It bag bearing last greatest name parson's daughter seized emptied her lap. A ten-shilling piece, small silver, twopence halfpenny jingled together, roused silver-haired, tawny-pawed terrier, left hearthrug came smell matter. His mistress's right hand--absently caressing--quieted his feelings; left she held ten-shilling piece finger thumb, gazed thoughtfully bags squatted helpless row, twine-tied mouths hanging sides. It anxious consultation account-book half-sovereign exchanged silver; thanks clothing-club bag, looked leaner accommodation. In three-halfpenny bag (which bulged pence) silver solved copper, charity bag handsomely distended whole lot consigned table-drawer. Any one accustomed book-keeping must smile bag-keeping accounts; parson's daughter could never "bring her mind" keeping funds apart paper, mixing actual cash. Indeed, she could never brought her conscience it. Unless she taken tenth "charity" her dress pocket-money coin, put charity bag, self-imposed rule duty almsgiving would performed her soul's peace. The problem exercising her mind Saturday night spend left her benevolent fund treat children neighboring work-house. The fund low, decided matter. The following Wednesday would her twenty-first birthday. If children came tea her, foundation entertainment would, natural course things, laid Vicarage kitchen. The charity bag would provide extras feast. Nuts, toys, like. When parson's daughter locked drawer bandy-legged table, she vigor one made her mind, set rest her Saturday night's duties without delay. She put her Sunday clothes, her Bible Prayer-book, class-book pencil, oak chest foot bed. She brushed combed silver-haired terrier, looked abjectly depressed whilst doing, preposterously proud done. She washed her hair, studied her Sunday-school lesson morrow whilst drying. She spread colored quilt foot her white one terrier sleep on--a slur he always deeply resented. Then she went bed, slept one ought sleep Saturday night, bound Sunday School 9.15 following morning, clear mind Rudiments Faith, history Prophet Elisha, destinations parish magazines. SCENE II. Fatherless--motherless--homeless! A little work-house-boy, swarthy face tidily-cropped black hair, short thick fur mole, grubbing, quite cleverly mole, work-house garden. He set weed, weeding irregularly performed, his eyes heart clouds, he could see big boundary wall. For there--now dark white, white gray--some Air Tumbler pigeons turning somersaults homeward way, short regular intervals seemed tying knots lines flight. It much! The small gardener shamelessly abandoned his duties, and, curving his dirty paws side his mouth, threw his whole soul shouting words encouragement distant birds. "That is good un! On thee! Over ye go! Oo--ooray!" It last prolonged cheer drowned sound footsteps path behind him, he tumbler pigeon he could jumped nimbly man's hand fell upon his shoulder. Up went his arms shield his ears well-merited cuffing; fate kinder he deserved. It old man (prematurely aged drink consequent poverty), whose faded eyes seemed rekindle he also gazed pigeons, spoke one knows. "Yon's Daddy Darwin's Tumblers." This old pauper lately come "the House" (the house never home!), boy clung eagerly his flannel sleeve, plied thick fast questions world without workhouse-walls, happy owner yet happier creatures free earth, skies. The poor old pauper quite willing talk boy listen. It restored self-respect lose consequences follies able say Daddy Darwin he mates together, pigeon-fancying common "many long year afore" he came House. And two made friendship matters bring man boy together end time. And old pauper waxed eloquent feats Homing Birds Tumblers, points Almonds Barbs, Fantails Pouters; sprinkling his narrative also high sounding heterogeneous titles, Dragons Archangels, Blue Owls Black Priests, Jacobines, English Horsemen Trumpeters. And much boasting high stakes he pigeon-match then, bitter complaints harsh hospitality House he "had come to" now, never seemed occur connect two, warn lad hung upon his lips one cannot eat his cake rash appetites youth, yet hope support nourishment his old age. The longest story old man told "bit trip" he made Liverpool, see Antwerp Carriers flown thence Ghent, he fixed date remembering his twin sons born his absence, though birthday day race, his "missus turned stoopid," women (he warned boy) apt do, refused christened uncommon names connected fancy. All same, he bet lads would nicknamed Antwerp Carriers, known day death, come soon suddenly, croup; (as oddly chanced) he another "bit holiday" fly pigeons his Lincolnshire. This tale come end voice authority called "Jack March," rubbed his mole-like head, went ruefully off, muttering he "catch now." "Sure enough! sure enough!" chuckled unamiable old pauper. But fate kinder lad his friend. His negligent weeding passed unnoticed, he wanted hurry join children school-room. The parson's daughter come, children sing her, Jack's voice could dispensed with. He "cleaned himself" alacrity, taking his place circle boys standing hands behind backs, he lifted voice worthy cathedral choir, whilst varying monotony sacred song secretly snatching tail terrier went snuffing round legs group. And feat he proved much superior rest boys (who also tried it) he excelled art singing. Later he learned young lady come invite tea her her birthday. Later still he found old pauper more, questioned closely village Vicarage, parishioners kept pigeons, where. And he went his straw bed night, his black head throbbed visions high hopes, entirely honor drinking tea pretty young lady, one behave abashing circumstances. He even dream principally possibility getting hold silver-haired, tawny-pawed dog tail freer conditions afternoon, though refreshing thought. What kept long awake thinking this. From top old walnut-tree top field back Vicarage, could see hill, top hill farm buildings. And (so old pauper told him) pretty pigeons lived, who, though free play among clouds, yet condescended make earthly home--in Daddy Darwin's Dovecot. SCENE III. Two two, girls boys, young lady's guests marched Vicarage. The school-mistress anxious carry his her tin mug, give little trouble possible; resolutely declined, much children's satisfaction, walk free hands, tea teacups saucers, like anybody else. It fine day, went well. The children enjoyed themselves, behaved admirably bargain. There one suspicion misconduct, matter far clear parson's daughter hushed up, and, speak, dismissed case. The children playing game Jack March supposed excel, came look he could nowhere found. At last he discovered, high among branches old walnut-tree top field, though his hands unstained his pockets empty, gardener, first spy him, loudly denounced ungrateful young thief. Jack, swollen eyes cheeks besmirched angry tears, vehemently declaring he climbed tree "have look Master Darwin's pigeons," picked much leaf, let alone walnut; gardener, "shaking truth him" collar his fustian jacket, preaching loudly sin adding falsehood theft, parson's daughter came up, and, end, acquitted poor Jack, gave leave amuse he pleased. It please Jack play his comrades then. He felt sulky aggrieved. He would liked play terrier stood his troubles, barked gardener; little friend trotted his mistress, gone choir-practice. Jack wandered among shrubberies. By-and-by he heard sounds music, led he came gate wall, dividing Vicarage garden churchyard. Jack loved music, organ voices drew till he reached church porch; he startled voice voice song, utterance moan doleful seemed outpouring his lonely, outcast, injured feelings one comprehensive howl. It voice silver-haired terrier. He sitting porch, his nose up, his ears down, his eyes shut, his mouth open, bewailing bitterness spirit second greater crook his lot. To purpose caresses care indulgence his mistress, daily walks, weekly washings combings, constant companionship, she betrayed her abiding sense his inferiority, first, letting sleep white quilt, secondly, never allowing go church? Jack shared terrier's mood. What tea plum-cake him, his pauper-breeding stamped upon gardener free say--"A nice tale too! What is thou wi' doves, thou work'us lad?"--and take granted he would thieve lie he got chance? His disabilities dog's, however. The parish church his well another's, he crept inside leaned one stone pillars, big, calm friend. Far away, transept, group boys men held music near faces waning light. Among towered burly choirmaster, baton hand. The parson's daughter organ. Well accustomed produce his voice good purpose, choirmaster's words clearly heard throughout building, subject articulation emphasis, like, he speaking; throwing extra aspirate energy enthusiasm without teaching worth name. "That will do. We must altogether different. You two lads singing like bumblebees pitcher--border there, boys!--it is laughing matter--put papers keep eyes me--inflate chest--" (his seemed fill field vision) "and try give forth noble words you would idea meant." No satire intended taken here, two boys, practicing duet anthem, laid music, turned eyes teacher. "I will run recitative," he added, "and take time stick. And mind OH." The parson's daughter struck chord, burly choirmaster spoke voice melody: "My heart disquieted within me. My heart--my heart disquieted within me. And fear death fallen--is fallen upon me." The terrier moaned without, Jack thought boy's voice could worth listening choirmaster. But he wrong. A notes organ, then, night-stillness wood broken nightingale, upon silence church boy-alto's voice broke forth obedience choirmaster's uplifted hand: "_Then_, I said--I said----" Jack gasped, even he strained his eyes see singer could look like, higher, clearer notes soprano rose --"Then I sa--a--id," duet began: "Oh I wings--O I wings like dove!" _Soprano_.--"Then would I flee away." _Alto_.--"Then would I flee away." _Together_.--"And rest--flee away rest." The clear young voices soared chased among arches, pinions prayed. Then--swept seats upward sweep choirmaster's arms--the chorus rose, birds rise, carried strain. It fine composition, final chorus singular charm fugue. And voices mourned like doves, "Oh I wings!" pursued plaintive passage, "Then would I flee away--then would I flee away----," Jack's ears knew weariness repetition. It strangely like watching rising falling Daddy Darwin's pigeons, tossed turns upon homeward flight. After fashion piece period, chorus repeated, singers rose supreme effort. The choirmaster's hands flashed hither thither, controlling, inspiring, directing. He sang among tenors. Jack's voice nearly choked longing sing too. Could words man go deeply home young heart caged within workhouse walls? "Oh I wings like dove! Then would I flee away--" choirmaster's white hands fluttering downwards dusk, chorus sank them--"flee away rest!" SCENE IV. Jack March busy little brain, his nature limp type sits grief. That memorable tea-party fired his soul two distinct ambitions. First, choir-boy; and, secondly, dwell Daddy Darwin's Dovecot. He turned matter his mind, patched together following facts: The Board Guardians meant apprentice him, Jack, master, earliest opportunity. Daddy Darwin (so old pauper told him) strange old man, come world, lived quite alone, soul help house outside it. He "not say _mazelin_ yet, getting helpless, uncommon mean." A nephew came one fine day fetched away old pauper, his great delight. It hands Jack despatched letter, nephew stamped posted him, duly delivered following morning Mr. Darwin Dovecot. The old man correspondents, he looked long letter he opened it. It credit teaching workhouse schoolmistress: "HONORED SIR, "They call Jack March. I am workhouse lad, but, sir, I am good one, Board means 'prentice next time. Sir, face Board take shall never regret it. Though I says should not I am handy lad. I will clean floor one, willing work early late, time life you are was, birds must take deal seeing to. I see garden I am set weed, I never saw nought like them. Oh, sir, I beg pray let mind pigeons. You will none worse lad place, I shall happy days life. Sir, I am unthankful, please GOD, I like home, house doves. "From humble servent--hoping be-- "JACK MARCH." "Mr. Darwin, Sir. I love Tumblers own." Daddy Darwin thought hard thought long letter. He changed his mind fifty times day. But Friday Board day, Friday came he "faced Board." And little workhouse lad went home Daddy Darwin's Dovecot. SCENE V. The bargain oddly made, worked well. Whatever Jack's parentage may (and he named stormy month he born), blood ran his veins could beggar's blood. There hopeless, shiftless, invincible idleness him. He found work given do, he attached passionately proudly belongings his new home. "Yon lad seem handy enough, Daddy;--for vagrant, one may say." Daddy Darwin smoking his garden wall, Mrs. Shaw, neighboring farm, paused her walk chat. She notable housewife, touch envy her sense improved appearance doorsteps visible points Dovecot. Daddy Darwin took his pipe his mouth make way force his reply: "_Vagrant!_ Nay, missus, yon's vagrant. _He's fettling along._ Jack's sort he finds key he will look lock; ye give knife-blade he will fashion heft. Why, vagrant's chap that, he would maester owns to-morrow, he would tramp afore t' year out, three years would not repair mischief he would leave behind him. A vagrant's chap ye lend thing he loses it; ye give thing he abuses it----" "That is true enough, there is plenty servant-girls same," put Mrs. Shaw. "Maybe be, madam--maybe be; vagrants' children, I reckon. But yon little chap I got t' House comes folk that is stuff own, cared it--choose were." "Well, Daddy," said his neighbor, without malice, "I will wish good evening. You have got good bargain parish, seems." But Daddy Darwin chuckled, stirred ashes bowl his pipe. "The you, madam--the you. Aye! he is good bargain--a good bargain Jack March." It might supposed foregoing dialogue Daddy Darwin model householder, little workhouse boy neatest creature breathing. But gentle reader may imagine much mistaken. Daddy Darwin's Dovecot freehold, he inherited his father was, still attached good bit land passed father son generations church registers old enough record. But remaining acres heavily mortgaged sold. So bit house property elsewhere, old homestead itself, left. And Daddy Darwin never sort man retrieve his luck home, seek abroad. That he inherited somewhat higher refined nature his neighbors rather hindered helped prosper. And he unlucky love. When energies he prime, his father's death left poor prospects old farmer whose daughter he betrothed broke match married her elsewhere. His Alice long another man's wife. She died within year her wedding-day, her husband married within year her death. Her old lover better able mend his broken heart his broken fortunes. He banished women Dovecot, shut coarse consolation his neighbors. In loneliness, eating kindly heart bitterness spirit, he ought had-- To plough sow And reap mow-- gone him, hands strangers; pigeons, Dovecot always famous, became business pleasure his life. But late years his stock dwindled, he rarely went pigeon-matches competed shows races. A miserable fancy rivalled his interest pigeon fancying. His new hobby hoarding; money that, years back, he would freely spent improve his breed Tumblers back his Homing Birds he added stealthy pleasure store behind secret panel fine old oak bedstead belonged Darwyn owned Dovecot sixteenth century latter end. In bedstead Daddy slept lightly late, old men will, he horrid dreams, old men need have. The queer faces carved panels (one hid money hole) used frighten he child. They frighten grotesque ugliness, he looked them, _and knew which_, he dreaded dying twilight dark, dreamed aged men living alone, murdered savings. These growing fears small share deciding try Jack March; see lad growing stronger, nimbler, devoted his master's interests day day, nightly comfort poor old hoarder bed-head. As his keen sense Jack's industry carefulness, part incompleteness Daddy Darwin's nature, ill-luck his career, he sensitive perception order beauty, shrewd observation ways living qualities character, yet allowed his early troubles blight completely he never put forth effort rise ruin, he least conscious his neighbors. That Jack neatest creature breathing, one look him, he stood pigeons his head arms shoulders, would enough prove. As first readiest repudiation his workhouse antecedents he let his hair grow till hung wildest elf-locks, though terms his service Daddy Darwin would not, case, provided handsome clothes, he certainly better attention he bestowed upon them. As regarded Dovecot, however, Daddy Darwin done justice his bargain. A strong grateful attachment his master, passionate love pigeons he tended, kept Jack constantly busy service both; old pigeon-fancier taught benefits scrupulous cleanliness pigeon-cote, Jack "stoned" kitchen-floor doorsteps his responsibility. The time come he tidied himself. SCENE VI. Daddy Darwin made first breach his solitary life his free will, fated widen. The parson's daughter soon heard he got lad workhouse, boy sang well climbed walnut-tree look Daddy Darwin's pigeons. The obvious parish questions presented young lady's mind. "Had boy christened? Did he go Church Sunday School? Did he say his prayers know his Catechism? Had he Sunday suit? Would he choir?" Then, supposing (a uncommon case) boy _had_ christened, _said_ he said his prayers, _knew_ his Catechism, _was_ ready school, church, choir, got Sunday suit--a fresh series riddles propounded her busy brain. Would her father yield his everyday coat take his Sunday one weekday wear? Could charity bag better pay tailor's widow adapting old coat new chorister's back, taking seams, turning wrong-side out, getting new sleeves old tails? Could she herself spare boots village cobbler re-soled her--somewhat clumsily--and would "allowance" bag bear strain? Might she hope coax old pair trowsers her cousin, spending his Long Vacation Vicarage, never reckoned closely _his_ allowance, kept charity bag all? Lastly would "that old curmudgeon Dovecot" let his little farm-boy go church school choir? "I must go persuade him," said young lady. What she said, (at time) Daddy Darwin said, Jack never knew. He high sport terrier round big sweet-brier bush, he saw his old master slitting seams his weather-beaten coat haste he plucked crimson clove carnations dandelions, presented them, ungracefully, parson's daughter. Jack knew she come, strained his ears catch his name. But Daddy Darwin promising pipings cloves. "They dear old-fashioned things," said she, burying her nose bunch. "We are old-fashioned altogether, here, Miss," said Daddy Darwin, looking wistfully tumble-down house behind them. "You are pretty here," said she, looking also, thinking sketch would make, she could keep friendly terms old recluse, get leave sit garden. Then her conscience smiting her selfishness, she turned her big eyes put her small hand. "I much obliged you, Mr. Darwin, much obliged indeed. And I hope Jack credit kindness. And thank much cloves," she added, hastily changing subject cost argument, she wish reopened. Daddy Darwin thoughts reopening it. He slowly getting his ideas together say lad see he got along school trying choir, he found young lady's hand his, take care hurt it, whilst she rained thanks flowers. "You are freely welcome, Miss," he say all. In evening, however, he moody, Jack dying curiosity, last could contain longer. "What Miss Jenny want, Daddy?" he asked. The old man looked grim. "First make fool me, i' t' second place make fool thee," his reply. And he added pettish emphasis, "They are alike, gentle simple. Lad, lad! If ye'd peace life never let woman's foot across threshold. Steek t' door house--if ye one--and t' door heart--if ye one--and ye'll never rue. Look coat!" And old man went grumpily bed, dreamed Miss Jenny put her little foot his threshold, he shown her secret panel, let her take away his savings. And Jack went bed, dreamed he went school, showed Phoebe Shaw his Sunday suit. This dainty little damsel long making havoc Jack's heart. The attraction must one contrast, whereas Jack black grubby, week-day clothes--which ragged that--Phoebe fair, exquisitely clean, quite terribly tidy. Her mother neatest woman parish. It she will not say her trembling handmaid, "I hope I black grate without blacking myself." But little Phoebe promised far out-do her mother, seemed doubtful she could "black herself" she tried. Only bloom childhood could resisted polishing effects yellow soap, Phoebe's brow cheeks resist it. Her shining hair was--compressed plait would done credit rope-maker. Her pinafores speckless, her white Whitsun frock--Jack could think nothing least like Phoebe that, except snowy fantail strutting Dovecot roof; and, say truth, likeness remarkable. It shown Jack March mind master his fate, he succeed making friends little Phoebe Shaw. This Miss Jenny's visit, incident shall recorded here. Early Sunday mornings Jack's custom hide his work-day garb angle ivy-covered wall Dovecot garden, letting his head appear top, whence he watched see Phoebe pass her way Sunday School, bewilder sight her starched frock, her airs her Bible Prayer-book, class card, clean pocket-handkerchief. Now, amongst rest her Sunday paraphernalia, Phoebe always carried posy, made herbs strong smelling flowers. Countrywomen take mint southernwood long hot service, fine ladies take smelling-bottles (for pleasant delusion writers weaker sex strong sex working classes). And though Phoebe suffer "fainty feels" like her mother, she her little playmates took posies Sunday School, refreshed nerves stream question answer, hair oil corduroy, airs elders. One day she lost her posy her way school, her loss Jack's opportunity. He waiting half-an-hour among ivy, he saw her him, fuzzling round round like kitten chasing tail. He sprang top wall. "Have ye lost something?" he gasped. "My posy," said poor Phoebe, lifting her sweet eyes, full tears. A second spring brought Jack dust her feet, he searched faithfully, wandering along path she come, she called back. "Never mind," she said. "They will likely dusty now." Jack used think worse anything coating dust; he paused, trying solve perpetual problem his situation, find little maid really wanted. "It Was Old Man marygolds," said she. "They are common enough." A light illumined Jack's understanding. "We have Old Man i' plenty. Wait, I will get thee fresh posy." And he began reclimb wall. But Phoebe drew nearer. She stroked her frock, spoke mincingly confidentially. "My mother says Daddy Darwin red bergamot i' his garden. We have none i' ours. My mother always says there is nothing like red bergamot take church. She says it is deal refreshing Old Man, common. My mother says she is always meaning ask Daddy Darwin let us root set; she does not often see him, she she does not think on. But she always says there is nothing like red bergamot, Aunt Nancy, she says same." "_Red_ it?" cried Jack. "You wait there, love." And Phoebe could say nay, he wall back his arms full. "Is lot?" he inquired, dropping small haycock flowers her feet. "Do not ye know one t'other?" asked Phoebe, round eyes reproach. And spreading her clean kerchief grass she laid her Bible Prayer-book class card it, set vigorously nattily work, picking one flower another fragrant confusion, nipping stalks even lengths, rejecting withered leaves, instructing Jack she proceeded. "I suppose ye know rose? That is double velvet.[4] They dry sweeter lavender linen. These dark red things pheasants' eyes; but, dear, dear, lad! Ye'd dragged roots! And eh! Master Darwin say he misses pink hollyhocks And bud, too! _There's_ red Bergamot: smell it!"[5] [Footnote 4: Double velvet, old summer rose, common It described Parkinson.] [Footnote 5: Red Bergamot, Twinflower; _Monarda Didyma_.] It barely touched Jack's willing nose hastily withdrawn. Phoebe caught sight Polly Susan Smith coming school, crying she late must run, little maid picked her paraphernalia (not forgetting red bergamot), fled lane. And Jack, equal haste, snatched tell-tale heap flowers threw disused pig-sty, unlikely Daddy Darwin would go look his poor pink hollyhocks. SCENE VII. April busy month Dovecot. Young birds chipping egg, parent birds feeding young relieving nest, Jack his master constantly occupied excited. One night Daddy Darwin went bed; but, though he tired, he sleep long. He sold couple handsome quarrelsome pigeons, advantage, added price hoard bed-head. This renewed his old fears, store becoming valuable; he wondered really escaped Jack's quick observation, whether boy knew it, and, perhaps, talked it. As he lay worried he fancied he heard sounds without--the sound footsteps voices. Then his heart beat till he could hear nothing else; he could undoubtedly hear nothing all; he certainly heard something probably rats. And he lay cold sweat, pulled rug his face, made his mind give money parson, poor, he spared till daylight. He _was_ spared till daylight, recovered himself, settled leave money was, Jack rushed pigeon-house face dire dismay. He made one two futile efforts speak, unconsciously used words Shakespeare put mouth Macduff, "All pretty 'uns!" burst tears. And old man made his way pigeon-house, followed poor Jack, he found eggs cold callow young shivering deserted nests, every bird gone. And he remembered robbers, maddened thought whilst he lay expecting thieves break steal his money he let get safely his whole stock pigeons. Daddy Darwin never taken arms his troubles, one crushed him. The fame beauty his house-doves left prosperity place, nothing left-- _nothing_! Below dreary thought lay far bitter one, he dared confide Jack. He heard robbers; he might frightened away; he might least given lad chance save his pets, care crossed his mind except safety his old bones, miserable savings bed-head, he enduring much scrape together (oh satire!) distant connection he never seen. He crept back kitchen, dropped heap upon settle, muttered himself. Then his thoughts wandered. Supposing pigeons gone good, would he ever make his mind take money money-hole, buy fresh stock? He knew he never would, shrank meaner heap upon settle he said himself. He like look his faithful lad face. Jack looked face, and, finding help there, acted pretty promptly behind his back. He roused parish constable, fetched functionary Dovecot he bite sup break his fast. He spread meal Daddy, borrowed Shaws' light cart whilst eating it. The Shaws good farmer-folk, sympathized fully; Jack glad words pity Phoebe. She said she watched pretty pets "many score times," comforted one Jack's heartstrings. Phoebe's mother paid respect his sense promptitude. He acted exactly she would done. "Daddy right enough yon lad," she admitted. "He is one let grass grow his feet." And she gave good breakfast whilst horse "put to." It pleased her Jack jumped left half delicious cold tea-cake behind cart-wheels grated outside. Mrs. Shaw sent Phoebe put cake his pocket, "the Measter" helped Jack took reins. He said he would "see Daddy Darwin it," added weight his opinion constable, pigeons taken "a beastly low place" (as he put it) lately set pigeon-shooting outskirts neighboring town. They paused longer Dovecot needed hustle Daddy Darwin seat beside Master Shaw, Jack fill his pockets peas, take his place beside constable. He certain ideas his matter, confused jogtrot light cart, give final jumble poor Daddy Darwin's faculties. No wonder jumbled! The terrors night past, shock morning, completeness loss, piteous sight pigeon-house, remorseful shame, then--after years, he gone half mile his hearthstone--to set world see, front seat market-cart, back back parish constable, jogged miles nothing, crowded streets nothing, Beaulieu Gardens nothing; Master Shaw talking away easily sitting two armchairs, making "stepping into" lawyer's office, "going on" Town Hall, he talking stepping his bedchamber going garden! That day passed like dream, Daddy Darwin remembered happened one remembers visions night. He vision (a unpleasing vision) proprietor Beaulieu Gardens, big greasy man, sinister eyes close together, hook nose, heavy watch chain, bullying voice. He browbeat constable soon, even bullied Master Shaw silence. No help his loud indignation supposed traffic thieves. When he turned tables talking slander, loss time, compensation, Daddy Darwin smelt money, tremblingly whispered Master Shaw apologize get it. "They are gone good," he almost sobbed: "Gone good, like t' rest! And I will long  them." But even he spoke he heard sound made lift his head. It Jack's call feeding-time pigeons Dovecot. And quick following musical familiar sound came another. The old man put his lean hands behind his ears sure he heard aright--the sound wings--the wings dove! The men heard ran in. Whilst wrangling, Jack slipped past them, made his way weird enclosure front pigeon-house. And found him, captive pigeons coming his call; flying, fluttering, strutting, nestling head foot him, he scattering peas like hail. He first speak, choke his voice. His iron temperament white heat, and, he afterwards said, he "cared yon dirty chap wi' big nose, he _ratten_[6] hay-loft!" [Footnote 6: _Anglicé_ Rat.] "These ours," he said, shortly. "I will count  them over, see they are right. There one young 'un could fly. A white 'un." ("It is here," interpolated Master Shaw.) "I will pack  them i' yon," Jack turned his thumb heap hampers corner. "T' carrier leave t' baskets t' toll-bar next Saturday, ye may send lad  them, ye keep one." The proprietor Beaulieu Gardens man easily abashed, pigeons packed he fairly resumed his previous powers speech. Then, Master Shaw said, he talked "on side his mouth." Most willing he help bring justice scoundrels deceived robbed Mr. Darwin, he feared would difficult trace. His feeling wishing pleasantness among neighbors. The pigeons found Gardens. That enough. He would glad settle business court. Daddy Darwin heard chink dirty man's money, would compounded matter there. But parish constable, saw famous; Jack, turned eyes smouldering fire Master Shaw. "Maester Shaw! you will let chaps get off? Daddy's mazelin' wi' trouble, sir, I reckon you will see it." "If costs t' worth pigeons ten times over, I will see it, lad," Master Shaw's reply. And parish constable rose even vein satire he avenged man slighted his office. "Settle court? Aye! I dare say. And send t' chaps fetch  them away t' night after. Nay--bear hand hamper, Maester Shaw, please--if it is t' you, Mr. Proprietor, I think shall trouble step t' Town Hall by-and-by, see cannot get shut mistaking friends three months way." If day trying one Daddy Darwin night followed far worse. The thieves known police, case come Town Hall following morning; meanwhile constable thought fit keep pigeons his charge village lock-up. Jack refused parted his birds, remained them, leaving Daddy Darwin alone Dovecot. He dared go bed, pleasant night he spent, dozing weariness, starting fright, arm-chair facing money-hole. Some things he nervous he got quite used to, however. He bore sufficient dignity publicity Town Hall, great sensation created pigeons let loose without, coming Jack's call. Some fed boy's lips, he hero hour, Daddy Darwin's delight. Then lawyer lawyer's office proved genial comfortable him. He liked civil ways smooth speech, understood far better Master Shaw's brevity uncouthness. The lawyer chatted kindly intelligently; he gave Daddy Darwin wine biscuit, talked long standing Darwin family vicissitudes; he even took fat yellow books, showed old man many curious laws made time time special protection pigeons Dovecots, ancient statutes making killing house-dove felony. Then 1 James I. c. 29 awarded three months' imprisonment "without bail main price" person "shoot at, kill, destroy gun, crossbow, stone-bow, longbow, house-dove pigeon;" allowed alternative fine twenty shillings paid churchwardens parish benefit poor. Daddy Darwin hoped alternative case, proved 2 Geo. III. c. 29, twenty-shilling fine transferred owner birds; point another client called, polite lawyer left Daddy study laws himself. It Jack helping Master Shaw put horse cart, trial over, farmer said him, "I do not want put about, lad, I am afraid will not keep master long. T'old gentleman's breaking up, mark words! Constable going _George_ glass, Master Darwin left us went back office. I says, 'What ye going back t' lawyer for?' he says, 'I do not mind telling you, Master Shaw, it is make will.' And he goes. Now, there is two things death, Jack March! And one's parson, t' other's doctor." SCENE VIII. Little Phoebe Shaw coming day school, picking her way home tea, startled folk running past her, sound cheering far end village, gradually increased volume, caught bystanders ran. When Phoebe heard "Constable, Master Shaw, Daddy Darwin his lad, coming home, pigeons along wi'  them," she felt inclined run too; fit shyness came her, she demurely decided wait school-gate till came her way. They come. They stopped. What doing? Another bystander explained, "They are shaking hands wi' Daddy, I reckon they are making put t' birds here, see  them go home t' Dovecot." Phoebe ran her life. She loved beast bird well Jack himself, fame Daddy Darwin's doves great. To see put fly home adventure sight lightly forgone. The crowd moved hillock neighboring field she touched outskirts. By time pretty well numbered population village, oldest inhabitant youngest could run. Phoebe her mother's courage resource. Chirping feebly clearly, "I am Maester Shaw's little lass, ye let through?" she passed hand hand, till her little fingers found Jack's tight clasp, he fairly lifted her her father's side. She time. Some birds hung Jack, nervous, expecting peas; hesitation past. Free sweet sunshine--beating evening air silver wings feathers like gold--ignorant cold eggs callow young dead deserted nests--sped way roar rarely shook village body corporate--they flew straight home--to Daddy Darwin's Dovecot. SCENE IX. Daddy Darwin lived good many years making his will, Dovecot prospered his hands. It would say prospered hands Jack March. By hook crook he increased live stock place. Folk kind one set excellent example farm lads, though he lacked primal virtue belonging neighborhood. He bartered pigeons fowls, one gave sitting eggs "see he would make  them." Master Shaw gave little pig, kind words good counsel; Jack cleaned disused pigstys, never disused again. He scrubbed his pigs soap water Christians, admirable animals regardless pork coming to, infinite credit, brought profit bargain, he spent ducks' eggs, additions his farmyard family. The Shaws kind him; Mrs. Shaw's secrets must told, Phoebe unchangeably increasingly kind him, she sent pretty maid (who knack knowing her mind things) service. Jack March handsome, stalwart youth now, irreproachable conduct, qualities Mrs. Shaw particularly prized; he farm-lad, match her daughter. Jack saw his sweetheart several years. She well, home benefit "native air." He walked hill her returned church, lived remembrance walk two three years more. Phoebe given her Prayer-book carry, he found dead flower it, jealous. She asked he knew was, he replied fiercely he not, sure he cared know. "Ye never know much flowers," said Phoebe, demurely, "it is red bergamot." "I love--red bergamot," he whispered penitently. "And thou owes bit. I gave thee once." And Phoebe let put withered bits his hymn-book, he deserved. Jack still choir, taught Sunday School he used learn. The parson's daughter her way; Daddy Darwin grumbled first, end he got bottle-green Sunday-coat oak-press matched bedstead, put house-key his pocket, went church too. Now, years past he failed take his place, week week, pew traditionally appropriated use Darwins Dovecot. In hour sordid cares secret panel weighed less heavily his soul, things seen came nearer--the house made hands, treasures rust moth corrupt not, thieves break steal. Daddy Darwin died old age. As his health failed, Jack nursed tenderness woman; kind inquiries, dainties Jack could cooked, came many quarters pleased old man find he held respect remembrance. One afternoon, coming farmyard, Jack found sitting kitchen-table he lad left him, dread look change upon his face. At first he feared "a stroke," Daddy Darwin's mind clear his voice firmer usual. "My lad," he said, "fetch yon tea-pot corner cupboard. T' one wi' pole-house[7] painted it, letters. Take care ye shift it. It t' merry feast-pot[8] christening, yon's t' letters father's mother's names. Take t' lid. There is two bits paper inside." [Footnote 7: A _pole-house_ small dovecot top pole.] [Footnote 8: "Merry feast-pot" name given old pieces ware, made local potteries local festivals.] Jack he bid, laid papers (one small yellow age, bigger, blue, neatly written upon) his master's right hand. "Read yon," said old man, pushing small one towards him. Jack took wondering. It letter he written workhouse fifteen years before. That he could see. The past surged thickly his eyes, tossing impetuously him, he dropped chair table, snatching Daddy Darwin's hands he held his face tears. "GOD bless thee!" he sobbed. "You have good maester me!" "_Daddy_," wheezed old man. "_Daddy_, maester." And drawing his right hand away, he laid solemnly young man's head. "GOD bless _thee_, reward thee. What I done i' feckless life deserve son? But ever lad earned father home, thou hast earned  them, Jack March." He moved his hand laid trembling paper. "Every word i' letter ye've made good. Every word, even t' bit end. 'I love tumblers own,' says you. Lift thee head, lad, look me. _They thy own!_... Yon blue paper's last testament, made many year back Mr. Brown, Green Street, Solicitor, nice gentleman too; witnessed his clerks, two decent young chaps, civil enough, much watchchain situation. Jack March, son, I left thee maester Dovecot I have. And there is bit money t' bed-head that will help thee make fair start, bury decently atop father mother. Ye may let Bill Sexton toll hour-bell me, I am old standard, I never good much. Maybe I might ha' done better things happened different fashion; Lord knows all. I would like hymn grave, Jack, Vicar objections, thou sing thee can. Do not fret, son, thou'fet because. It Was sweet voice thine took back public worship, it is t' least I owe thee, Jack March. A poor reason lad, taking neglected duty--a poor reason--but Lord GOD mercy, there would small chance us. If Miss Jenny her husband come t' Vicarage summer, say I left her duty old man's blessing; she wants roots t' garden, give  them her, give her yon old chest stands back chamber. It belonged uncle mother's--a Derbyshire man. They say her husband's rich gentleman, treats her well. I reckon she may she is mind, new polished, she is always old lumber. They are whimsical lot, gentle simple. A talking _women_, Jack, I have word say, I fetch breath say it. Lad! sure you are maester Dovecot, you will give missus. Now take heed me. If ye fetch woman home Phoebe Shaw, I will _walk_, scare ye away t' old place. I am willing Phoebe, I charge ye tell lass hereafter. And tell her it is she is fair--too many  them that; she is thrifty houseproud--her mother's that, she is favorite mine; I have watched her whenever t' ould cat 's let her home, it is belief she loves ye, knowing nought _this_" (he laid his hand upon will), "and she will stick ye, choose her folks may say. Aye, aye, she is one t' sort quits falling house--_like rattens_." Language fails convey bitterness old man put last two words. It exhausted him, his mind wandered. When he extent recovered he spoke again, feebly. "Tak' duty Vicar, lad, Daddy Darwin's duty, say he is t' last feather shuttle, would thankful Sacrament." The Parson come gone. Daddy Darwin care lie down, he breathed difficulty; Jack made easy big armchair, raked fire cinders, took chair side hearth watch him. The old man slept comfortably last, much wearied, young man dozed also. He awoke Daddy Darwin moved, moment he thought he must dreaming. So erect old man stood, delight his wide-open eyes. They looking Jack's head. All lad never seen upon his face seemed come back it--youth, hope, resolution, tenderness. His lips trembling smile acutest joy. Suddenly he stretched his arms, crying, "Alice!" started forward fell--dead--on breast his adopted son. * * * * * Craw! Craw! Craw! The crows flapped slowly home, Gaffers moved too. The sun down, "damps" bad "rheumatics." "It is strange tale," said Gaffer II., "but all's true ye tell me, there is many like him." "That is right enough," Gaffer I. admitted. "He is t' through, ye ha' seen burying he gave t' old chap. He rare good accounts, never gainsaid ought, except i' lifting his voice he ha' done t' grave. Jacks sings bass solo well man i' t' place, he stood yonder, t' world like one crows, black visage, black wi' funeral clothes, choked crying like child i'stead man." "Well, well, t' old chap he had, I reckon," said Gaffer II. "_That's_ right enough; going backwards, ye may say, setting wild graff old standard, yon will's done well DADDY DARWIN'S DOVECOT." THE BLIND MAN AND THE TALKING DOG. There old man Fortune (whose eyes bandaged) deprived his sight. She taken his hearing also, he deaf. Poor he always been, Time stolen his youth strength him, left light burden Death carry he come old man's way. But Love (who blind also) given Blind Man Dog, led morning seat sun crab-tree, held his hat wayside alms, brought safely home sunset. The Dog wise faithful--as dogs often are--but wonder he could talk. In seen difference dogs men, talk; whilst matter admiration wise faithful. One day Mayor's little son came road, hand he held his playmate Aldegunda. "Give poor Blind Man penny," said she. "You always wanting give away money," replied boy peevishly. "It well father richest man town, I whole silver crown yet pocket." But he put penny hat Dog held out, Dog gave his master. "Heaven bless you," said Blind Man. "Amen," said Dog. "Aldegunda! Aldegunda!" cried boy, dancing delight. "Here dog talk. I would give silver crown him. Old man, I say, old man! Will sell dog silver crown?" "My master deaf well blind," said Dog. "What miserable old creature he must be," said boy compassionately. "Men smile miserable, they?" said Dog; "and master smiles sometimes--when sun warms right coats bones; he feels hat shake his knee pennies drop in; I lick his hand." "But that, he poor wretched old beggar, want everything," persisted boy. "Now I Mayor's son, he richest man town. Come live me, I give Blind Man silver crown. I perfectly happy I talking dog own." "It worth thinking of," said Dog. "I certainly like master perfectly happy. You sure nothing else wish for?" "I wish I man," replied boy. "To exactly I chose, plenty money spend, holidays year round." "That sounds well," said Dog. "Perhaps I better wait till grow up. There nothing else want, I suppose?" "I want horse," said boy, "a real black charger. My father ought know I old hobby-horse. It vexes look it." "I must wait charger, I see," said Dog. "Nothing vexes hobby-horse, I hope?" "Aldegunda vexes anything," answered boy, aggrieved air; "and it is hard I fond her. She always tumbles run races, her legs short. It is her birthday to-day, she toddles badly she yesterday, though she is year older." "She learned run time man," said Dog. "So nice little lady give annoyance, I sure?" The boy frowned. "She always wanting something. She wants something now, I see. What want, Aldegunda?" "I wish--" said Aldegunda, timidly,--"I like--the blind man silver crown, us keep penny, get back hat." "That is way go on," said boy, angrily. "You always think differently me. Now remember, Aldegunda, I will not marry grow big, unless agree I do, like wife story 'What Goodman sure right.'" On hearing Aldegunda sobbed till she burst strings her hat, boy tie afresh. "I will not marry cry," said he. But she cried more, went away bickering green lanes. As old man, he heard nothing; dog licked his withered hand he smiled. Many time boy return his playmate try get Talking Dog. But Dog always asked he yet got he wanted, and, honorable child, boy truthful say he content he not. "The day want nothing I dog," said. "Unless, indeed, present master attained perfect happiness you." "I afraid that," said boy. In time Mayor died, his widow moved her native town took her son her. Years passed, Blind Man lived on; one gets old keeps quiet his little corner world, Death seems sometimes forget remove him. Years passed, Mayor's son became man, strong rich, fine black charger. Aldegunda grew also. She beautiful, wonderfully beautiful, Love (who blind) gave her her old playmate. The wedding fine one, bridegroom mounted his black charger took his bride behind him, rode away green lanes. "Ah, delight!" he said. "Now ride town lived children; Blind Man still alive, shall give silver crown; Talking Dog alive, I shall claim him, to-day I perfectly happy want nothing." Aldegunda thought herself--"We happy, much, I like take Blind Man's dog him;" she dare say so. One--if two--must bear forbear happy even one's wedding day. By-and-bye rode crab-tree, seat empty. "What become Blind Man?" Mayor's son asked peasant near. "He died two days ago," said peasant. "He buried to-day, priest chanters returning grave." "And Talking Dog?" asked young man. "He grave now," said peasant; "but he neither spoken eaten since his master died." "We come nick time," said young man triumphantly, he rode churchyard. By grave dog, man said, winding path came priest his young chanters, sang shrill, clear voices--"Blessed dead die Lord." "Come live me, old master gone," said young man, stooping dog. But he made reply. "I think he dead, sir," said grave-digger. "I do not believe it," said young man fretfully. "He Enchanted Dog, he promised I I could say I ready say now. He kept his promise." But Aldegunda taken dog's cold head her arms, her tears fell fast it. "You forget," she said; "he promised come happy, his old master happier first; and, perhaps--" "I remember always disagree me," said young man, impatiently. "You always so. Tears wedding-day, too! I suppose truth one happy." Aldegunda made answer, one loves he willingly learn selfish imperious temper happiness never dwells. And rode away green lanes, shrill voices chanters followed them--"Blessed dead. Blessed dead." "SO-SO." "Be sure, child," said widow her little daughter, "that always told." "Very well, Mother." "Or rate well," said small house-dog, he lay blinking fire. "You darling!" cried little Joan, she sat hearth hugged him. But he got shook himself, moved three turns nearer oven, way; though her arms soft she kept her doll them, made wood, hurts. "What dear, kind house-dog are!" said little Joan, she meant she said, feel nice sharp edges one's duty little softened one. He particular kind dog, he smooth stroke, nice way blinking his eyes, soothing see. There difficulty his name. The name house-dog Faithful, well became him, his tombstone testified. The one called Wolf. He wild, ended his days gallows, worrying sheep. The little house-dog never chased anything, widow's knowledge. There reason whatever giving bad name, she thought several good ones, Faithful, Trusty, Keeper, fine old-fashioned titles, none seemed quite perfectly suit him. So he called So-so; nice soft name is. The widow poor woman, though she contrived her industry keep decent home together, get one another little comfort herself her child. One day she going business, she called her little daughter said her, "I going two hours. You young protect house, So-so strong Faithful was. But I go, shut house-door bolt big wooden bar, sure open reason whatever till I return. If strangers come, So-so may bark, he well bigger dog. Then go away. With summer's savings I bought quilted petticoat duffle cloak winter, I get work I going to-day, I shall buy enough wool knit warm stockings us both. So patient till I return, plumcake cupboard tea." "Thank you, Mother." "Good-bye, child. Be sure I told you," said widow. "Very well, Mother." Little Joan laid her doll, shut house-door, fastened big bolt. It heavy, kitchen looked gloomy she done it. "I wish Mother taken us three her, locked house put key her big pocket, she done before," said little Joan, she got rocking-chair, put her doll sleep. "Yes, would done well," So-so replied he stretched hearth. By-and-bye Joan grew tired hushabying doll, looked none sleepier it, she took three-legged stool sat front clock watch hands. After she drew deep sigh. "There sixty seconds every single minute, So-so," said she. "So I heard," said So-so. He snuffing back place, usually allowed. "And sixty whole minutes every hour, So-so." "You do not say so!" growled So-so. He found bit, cake top shelf. There much spilt crumb, though he snuffed every corner kitchen, till he stood snuffing house-door. "The air smells fresh," he said. "It is beautiful day, I know," said little Joan. "I wish Mother allowed us sit doorstep. We could taken care house--" "Just well," said So-so. Little Joan came smell air keyhole, and, So-so said, smelt fresh. Besides, one could see window fine evening was. "It is exactly Mother told us do," said Joan, "but I believe--" "It would well," said So-so. By-and-bye little Joan unfastened bar, opened door, she doll So-so went sat doorstep. Not stranger seen. The sun shone delightfully. An evening sun, hot. All day ripening corn field close by, glowed waved breeze. "It well, better," said little Joan, "for anyone comes see coming field-path." "Just so," said So-so, blinking sunshine. Suddenly Joan jumped up. "Oh!" cried she, "there is bird, big bird. Dear So-so, see him? I cannot, sun. What queer noise he makes. Crake! crake! Oh, I see now! He flying, he running, he gone corn. I wish I corn, I would catch him, put cage." "I will catch him," said So-so, he put his tail, started off. "No, no!" cried Joan. "You go. You must stay take care house, bark one comes." "You could scream, would well," replied So-so, his tail still up. "No, would not," cried little Joan. "Yes, would," reiterated So-so. Whilst bickering, old woman came door; she brown face, black hair, old red cloak. "Good evening, little dear," said she. "Are home fine evening?" "Only three us," said Joan; "I, doll, So-so. Mother' gone town business, taking care house, So-so wants go bird saw run corn." "Was pretty bird, little dear?" asked old woman. "It curious one," said Joan, "and I like go myself, cannot leave house." "Dear, dear! Is neighbor would sit doorstep keep house till slip field curious bird?" said old woman. "I am afraid not," said little Joan. "Old Martha, neighbor, bedridden. Of course, she able mind house instead us, would done well." "I distance go evening," said old woman, "but I object minutes' rest, sooner lose bird I sit doorstep oblige you, run cornfield." "But bark one comes?" asked little Joan. "For cannot, So-so must stay you." "I call dog I see one coming, well," said old woman. "So will," replied little Joan, she ran cornfield, where, matter, So-so run her, bounding barking springing among wheat stalks. They catch bird, though stayed longer intended, though So-so seemed know hunting supposed. "I dare say mother come home," said little Joan, went back field-path. "I hope she will not think ought stayed house." "It taken care of," said So-so, "and must well." When reached house, widow come home. But old woman gone, she taken quilted petticoat duffle cloak, plum-cake top shelf away her; ever heard lot. "For future, child," said widow, "I hope always told, whatever So-so may say." "I will, Mother," said little Joan (And she did.) But house-dog sat blinked. He dared speak, he disgrace. I feel quite sure So-so. Wild dogs often amend ways far side gallows, faithful sometimes fall; one begins So-so, he apt So-so end. So-so is seldom change. But one _very_ soft nice, he got cake tea-time. On whole, hope he lived good dog ever after. THE TRINITY FLOWER. A LEGEND. "Break forth, lips, praise, The wiser love severely kind: Since, richer chastening grown, I see, whereas I blind." _The Clear Vision, J. G. Whittler_ In days yore certain hermit, dwelt cell, he fashioned natural cave side hill. Now hermit great love flowers, moreover learned virtues herbs, great mystery healing lies hidden among green things God. And came pass country people parts came simples grew little garden he made his cell. And his fame spread, people came him, he added plat he reclaimed waste land around. But many years came spring colors flowers seemed paler hermit used be; summer drew shapes became indistinct, he mistook one plant another; autumn came, he told various scents, form, rather sight; flowers gone, winter come, hermit quite blind. Now hamlet lived boy become known hermit manner. On edge hermit's garden grew two crab trees, fruit he made every year certain confection grateful sick. One year many crab-apples stolen, sick folk hamlet little conserve. So following year, fruit ripening, hermit spoke every day came his cell, saying:-- "I pray you, good people, make known he robs crab trees, robs alone, dishonest, sick, inhuman." And yet crab-apples taken. The following evening, hermit sat side hill, he overheard two boys disputing theft. "It must either big man, small boy it," said one. "So I say, I reason." "And thy reason, Master Wiseacre?" asked other. "The fruit high plucked except big man," said first boy. "And branches strong enough child climb." "Canst thou think way rob apple-tree standing a-tip-toe, climbing apples, come thee?" said second boy. "Truly thy head never save thy heels; here is riddle thee: "Riddle riddle re, Four big brothers we; We gather fruit, climb never tree. "Who they?" "Four tall robbers, I suppose," said other. "Tush!" cried his comrade. "They four winds; whistle, falls ripest. But others shake besides winds, I show thee thou hast doubts matter." And he spoke he sprang catch boy, ran him; chased hill, hermit heard more. But he turned go home he said, "The thief far away thou stoodst near. Nevertheless, I patience. It needs I go seek thee, saith Scripture? _Thy sin_ find thee out." And he made conserve apples left, said nothing. Now certain time plague broke hamlet; sore, nurse many sick, that, though will not hermit ever leave his place, yet need he came ministered people village. And one day, he passed certain house, he heard moans within, entering, he saw lying upon bed boy tossed moaned fever, cried miserably his throat parched burning. And hermit looked upon his face, behold boy given riddle four winds upon side hill. Then hermit fed confection he him, grateful boy's parched palate, he thanked blessed hermit aloud, prayed leave morsel behind, soothe his torments night. Then said hermit, "My Son, I would I confection, sake others well thee. But indeed I two trees bear fruit whereof made; two successive years apples stolen thief, thereby robbing me, dishonest, poor, inhuman." Then boy's theft came back his mind, he burst tears, cried, "My Father, I took crab-apples!" And awhile he recovered his health; plague also abated hamlet, hermit went back his cell. But boy would thenceforth never leave him, always wishing show his penitence gratitude. And though hermit sent away, he ever returned, saying, "Of avail drive thee, since I resolved serve thee, even Samuel served Eli, Timothy ministered unto St. Paul?" But hermit said, "My rule live alone, without companions; wherefore begone." And boy still came, he drove garden. Then boy wandered far wide, moor bog, gathered rare plants herbs, laid near hermit's cell. And hermit inside, boy came garden, gathered stones swept paths, tied plants drooping, neatly well, he quick skilful lad. And hermit said, "Thou hast done well, I thank thee; begone," he answered, "What avails it, I resolved serve thee?" So last came day hermit said, "It may ordained; wherefore abide, Son." And boy answered, "Even so, I resolved serve thee." Thus he remained. And thenceforward hermit's garden throve never thriven before. For, though he skill, hermit old feeble; boy young active, he worked hard, labor love. And clever boy, he quickly knew names properties plants well hermit himself. And he working, he would go far afield seek new herbs. And he always returned village night. Now hermit's sight began fail, boy put right he mistook one plant another; hermit became quite blind, he relied completely upon boy gather herbs he wanted. And anything new planted, boy led old man spot, he might know many paces direction cell, might feel shape texture leaves, learn scent. And skill knowledge boy, hermit wise hindered preparing his accustomed remedies, he knew names virtues herbs, every plant grew. And sun shone, boy would guide his master's steps garden, would lead certain flowers; perfume old man could go without help, guided scent. And he fingered leaves breathed fragrance, he would say, "Blessed GOD every herb field, thrice blessed smell." And end garden set bush rosemary. "For," said hermit, "to must come." Because rosemary herb scatter dead. And he knew almost everything grew, he know boy told him. Yet this, though he embraced poverty solitude joy, service GOD man, yet bitter blindness him, he bewailed loss his sight, grief never lessened. "For," said he, "if pleased Lord send affliction, continual pain consuming sickness, I would borne gladly, seeing would left free see herbs, I use benefit poor. But sick suffer blindness, boy also I continual burden." And boy called hours prayer, saying, "My Father, time Nones office, marygold closing," "The Vespers bell soon sound valley, bindweed bells folded," hermit recited appointed prayers, he always added, "I beseech Thee take away blindness, Thou didst heal Thy servant son Timaeus." And boy he sorted herbs, he cried, "Is balm Gilead?" And boy answered, "The balm Gilead grows six full paces gate, Father." But hermit said, "I spoke figure, son I meant herb. But, alas! Is remedy heal physician? No cure curer?" And boy's heart grew heavier day day, hermit's grief. For he loved him. Now one morning boy came village, hermit met him, groping painfully his hands, joy his countenance, he said, "Is thy step, son? Come in, I somewhat tell thee." And he said, "A vision vouchsafed me, even dream. Moreover, I believe shall cure blindness." Then boy glad, begged hermit relate his dream, he follows:-- "I dreamed, behold I stood garden--thou also me--and many people gathered gate, whom, thy help, I gave herbs healing fashion I able since blindness came upon me. And gone, I smote upon forehead, said, 'Where herb shall heal affliction?' And voice beside said, 'Here, son,' And I cried thee, 'Who spoke?' And thou saidst, 'It man pilgrim's weeds, lo, he hath strange flower his hand.' Then said Pilgrim, 'It Trinity Flower. Moreover, I suppose thou hast it, thou wilt see clearly.' Then I thought thou didst take flower Pilgrim put hand. And lo, eyes opened, I saw clearly. And I knew Pilgrim's face, though I seen I cannot yet recall. But I believed Raphael Archangel--he led Tobias, gave sight his father. And even came know him, he vanished; I saw more." "And Trinity Flower like, Father?" asked boy. "It size Herb Paris, son," replied hermit. "But instead fourfold every way, numbered mystic Three. Every part threefold. The leaves three, petals three, sepals three. The flower snow-white, three parts stained crimson stripes, like white garments dyed blood." [Footnote: _Trillium erythrocarpum._ North America.] Then boy started up, saying, "If plant earth I find thee." But hermit laid his hand him, said, "Nay, son, leave not, I need thee. And flower come yet, I shall see." And day long old man murmured himself, "Then I shall see." "And didst thou see me, garden, thy dream, Father?" asked boy. "Ay, I did, son. And I meant say thee much pleaseth thou art grown well, strangely fair countenance. Also garden I never beheld it, must needs due thy care. But wherefore didst thou tell fair palms grown thorn hedge will not be? I stretching hand some, I awoke." "There palms there, Father," said boy. "Now, indeed thy youth makes thee little observant," said hermit. "However, I pardon thee, good thought moved thee plant yew beyond rosemary bush; seeing yew emblem eternal life, lies beyond grave." But boy said, "There yew there, Father." "Have I seen it, even vision?" cried hermit. "Thou wilt say next borders set heart's-ease, indeed must thy industry; whence come I know not, rare beautiful, eyes long sore see again." "Alas, Father!" cried boy, "the borders set rue, clumps heart's-ease there." "Could I forget I saw hour?" asked old man, angrily. "And holy Raphael point them, saying, 'Blessed eyes behold garden, borders set heart's-ease, hedges crowned palm!' But thou wouldst know better archangel, forsooth." Then boy wept; hermit heard weeping, he put his arm round said, "Weep not, dear son. And I pray thee, pardon I spoke harshly thee. For indeed I ill-tempered reason infirmities; thee, GOD reward thee thy goodness me, I never can. Moreover, I believe thy modesty, great thy goodness, hath hindered thee telling thou hast done garden, even fair sweet everlasting flowers, like I never saw before, thou hast set east border, even I hear bees humming sun." Then boy looked sadly garden, answered, "I cannot lie thee. There everlasting flowers. It flowers thyme bees rioting. And hedge bottom creepeth bitter-sweet." But hermit heard not. He groped his way sunshine, wandered walks, murmuring himself, "Then I shall see." Now Summer past, one autumn morning came garden gate man pilgrim's weeds; he saw boy he beckoned him, giving small tuber root, he said, "Give thy master. It root Trinity Flower." And he passed towards valley. Then boy ran hastily hermit; he told him, given root, he said, "The face pilgrim known also, O Father! For I remember I lay sick plague, ever seemed shadowy figure passed out, went streets, his face face pilgrim. But--I cannot deceive thee--methought Angel Death." Then hermit mused; little space he answered, "It also I saw him. I remember now. Nevertheless, let us plant root, abide GOD shall send." And thus did. And Autumn Winter went by, hermit became feeble, boy constantly cheered him, saying, "Patience, Father. Thou shalt see yet!" But hermit replied, "My son, I repent I patient affliction. Moreover, I set thee ill example, I murmured GOD--Who knowest best--ordained me." And boy ofttimes repeated, "Thou shalt yet see," hermit answered, "If GOD will. When GOD will. As GOD will." And he said prayers Hours, he longer added he added beforetime, evermore repeated, "If THOU wilt. When THOU wilt. As THOU wilt!" And Winter passed; snow lay ground boy hermit talked garden; boy longer contradicted old man, though he spoke continually heart's-ease, everlasting flowers, palm. For he said, "When Spring comes I may able get plants, fit garden his vision." And length Spring came. And rose Trinity Flower. And leaves unfolded, three, hermit said. Then boy wild joy impatience. And sun shone two days together, he would kneel flower, say, "I pray thee, Lord, send showers, may wax apace." And rained, he said, "I pray Thee, send sunshine, may blossom speedily." For he knew ask. And he danced hermit, cried, "Soon shalt see." But hermit trembled, said, "Not I will, THOU wilt!" And bud formed. And length one evening he went hamlet, boy came hermit said, "The bud almost breaking, Father. To-morrow thou shalt see." Then hermit moved his hands till he laid boy's head, he said, "The Lord repay thee sevenfold thou hast done me, dear child. And I pray thee, son, give thy pardon I sinned thee word deed, indeed thoughts thee ever tender." And boy wept, hermit still pressed him, till he said he forgave him. And unwillingly parted, hermit said, "I pray thee, dear son, remember that, though late, I conformed GOD." Saying which, hermit went his cell, boy returned village. But great his anxiety, he could rest; he returned garden ere light, sat flower till dawn. And first dim light he saw Trinity Flower bloom. And hermit said, white, stained crimson blood. Then boy she would tears joy, he plucked flower ran hermit's cell, hermit lay still upon his couch. And boy said, "I disturb him. When he wakes he find flower." And he went sat outside cell waited. And weary he waited, he fell asleep. Now sunrise, whilst yet early, he awakened voice hermit crying, "My son, dear son!" he jumped up, saying, "My Father!" But he spoke hermit passed him. And he passed he turned, boy saw his eyes open. And hermit fixed long tenderly him. Then boy cried, "Ah, tell me, Father, dost thou see?" And he answered, _"I see now!"_ passed walk. And he went garden, still dawn, boy trembled, hermit's footsteps gave sound. And he passed beyond rosemary bush, came again. And day wore on, hermit return, boy went his cell. Without, sunshine dried dew paths hermit's feet left prints, cherished spring flowers bursting bloom. But within, hermit's dead body lay stretched upon his pallet, Trinity Flower his hand. THE KYRKEGRIM TURNED PREACHER. A LEGEND. It said Norway every church Niss, Brownie. They race Good People, haunt farm houses, maids' work pot cream. They size year-old child, faces faces aged men. Their common dress gray home-spun, red peaked caps; Michaelmas Day wear round hats. The Church Niss called Kyrkegrim. His duty keep church clean, scatter marsh-marigold flowers floor service. He also keeps order congregation, pinches fall asleep, cuffs irreverent boys, hustles mothers crying children church quickly decorously possible. But his business church-brawlers alone. When last snow avalanche slipped high-pitched roof, gentian bluer sky, Baldur's Eyebrow blossoms hot Spring sun, pious folk will not come church time service, bring spades, rakes, watering-pots them, tend graves dead. The Kyrkegrim sits Lych Gate overlooks them. At lay tools good time he throws pebbles, crying each, _"Skynde dig!"_ (Make haste!), drives in. And bells begin, man fail bow church custom is, Kyrkegrim snatches his hat behind, he sees more. Nothing displeases Kyrkegrim people fall asleep sermon. This seen following story. Once upon time certain country church, served mild excellent priest, haunted active Kyrkegrim. Not speck dust seen altar porch, behavior congregation beyond reproach. But one fat farmer slept sermon, Kyrkegrim would, he could keep awake. Again he pinch him, nudge him, let cold draught wind upon his neck. The fat farmer shook himself, pulled his neck-kerchief, dozed again. "Doubtless fault sermons," said priest, Kyrkegrim complained him. For he humble-minded. But Kyrkegrim knew case, better preacher district. And yet he overheard farmer's sharp-tongued little wife speak discourse, he began think might so. No doubt preacher spoke somewhat fast slow, little loud soft. And he "stirring" enough, said farmer's wife; failing one ever laid her door. "His soul charge," sighed good priest, "and I cannot even make hear I got say. A heavy reckoning demanded me!" "The sermons fault, beyond doubt," Kyrkegrim said. "The farmer's wife quite right. She is sensible woman, use mop well myself." "Hoot, hoot!" cried church owl, pushing his head ivy-bush. "And shall she Kyrkegrim thou art turned preacher, preacher sits judgment seat? Not so, little Miss! Dust thou pulpit, leave parson preach, let Maker souls reckon them." "If preacher cannot keep people awake, time another took his place," said Kyrkegrim. "He bound find ears well arguments," retorted owl, he drew back his ivy-bush. But Kyrkegrim settled his red cap firmly his head, betook priest, whose meekness (as apt case) encouraged opposite qualities he do. "The farmer must roused somehow," said he. "It disgrace us all, what, hundreds years I Kyrkegrim, never befell before. It well next Sunday preach stirring sermon important subject." So preacher preached Sin--fair flower, bitter fruit!--and he preached his cheeks grew pale men's perils, Kyrkegrim trembled he sat listening porch, though he soul lose. "Was stirring enough?" he asked, twitching sleeve farmer's wife she flounced service. "Splendid!" said she, "and must hit folk pretty hard too." "It kept husband awake time, I think," said Kyrkegrim. "Heighty teighty!" cried farmer's wife. "I would know good man decent body parish, he take nap Sundays! He sinner he saint, thank Heaven, parson knows better preach him." "Next Sunday," said Kyrkegrim priest, "preach something concerns every one; respectable people well others." So preacher preached Death--whom tears cannot move, riches bribe, power defy. The uncertain interruption certain end life's labors! And he preached, women sitting seats wept dead whose graves tending, aged cheeks Kyrkegrim stole tears pity poor men, whose love labors cut short soon. But farmer slept before. "Do expect die?" asked Kyrkegrim. "Surely," replied farmer, "we must die day, one need preacher tell that. But funeral sermon, wife thinks. There bereavement miller's family." "Men strange race," thought Kyrkegrim; he went priest said--"The farmer afraid death. You must find subject men really stand awe." So Sunday came round again, preacher preached judgment--that dread Avenger dogs footsteps trespass, even now! That awful harvest whirlwind corruption must reap sow wind flesh! Lightly regarded, biding time, till man's forgotten follies find last. But farmer slept on. He wake preacher spoke judgment come, reckoning cannot shunned, trump Archangel, Day Doom. "On Michaelmas Day I shall preach myself," said Kyrkegrim, "and I cannot rouse him, I shall give charge here." This troubled poor priest, good Kyrkegrim likely found again. Nevertheless he consented, he meek, Michaelmas Day came Kyrkegrim pulled preacher's gown his homespun coat, laid his round hat desk iron-clamped Bible, began his sermon. "I shall give text," said he, "but I said seems good me, hear see Scriptures bear out." This uncommon beginning, good folk pricked ears, farmer among them, novelty agreeable church elsewhere. "I speak," said Kyrkegrim, "of last result sin, worst deaths, beginning judgment--hardness heart." The farmer looked little uncomfortable, Kyrkegrim went bravely on. "Let us seek examples Scripture. We speak Pharaoh." But Kyrkegrim spoke Pharaoh farmer ease again. And by-and-bye film stole gently his eyes, he nodded his seat. This made Kyrkegrim angry, he wish give his place, yet Niss may break his word. "Let us look punishment Pharaoh," he cried. But farmer's eyes still closed Kyrkegrim became agitated, turned hastily leaves iron-clamped Bible him. "We speak plagues," said he. "The plague blood, plague frogs, plague lice, plague flies--" At moment farmer snored. For brief instant, anger dismay kept Kyrkegrim silent. Then shutting iron clamps he pushed Book one side, scrambling stool, stretched his little body well desk, said, "But flies nothing fly coming turnip-crop!" The words hardly his mouth farmer sat suddenly upright, half rising his place, cried anxiously, "Eh, sir? What he say, wife? A new fly among turnips?" "Ah, soul clay!" yelled indignant Kyrkegrim, he hurled his round hat gaping farmer. "Is indeed thee Eternal Life kept store?" And drawing preacher's gown his head, he left pulpit, scrambling steps hastened church. * * * * * As he successful rousing sleepy farmer Kyrkegrim abandon his duties; said thenceforward he kept alone, left heavier responsibilities higher hands. * * * * *
