 MELCHIOR'S DREAM AND OTHER TALES MELCHIOR'S DREAM. AN ALLEGORY. "Thou hast given much me, Give one thing more--a grateful heart." GEORGE HERBERT. "Well, father, I do not believe Browns bit better are; yet I spent day young Brown, cooked sorts messes afternoon; he wasted twice much rum brandy lemons his trash, I want make good punch of. He quite surprised, too, I told mince-pies kept shut larder, brought meal-times, one apiece; he said mince-pies always going, he got one whenever he liked. Old Brown never blows sort thing; he likes Adolphus enjoy holidays, particularly Christmas." The speaker boy--if I may allowed use word speaking individual whose jackets time past resigned younger member his family, daily, privacy his apartment, examined his soft cheeks aid his sisters' "back-hair glass." He handsome boy too; tall, like David--"ruddy, fair countenance;" his face, though clouded then, bore expression general amiability. He eldest son large young family, educated one best public schools. He not, must confessed, think either small beer small beans himself; beer beans his family thought him, I think pale ale kidney-beans least. Young Hopeful had, however, his weak points like rest us; perhaps one weakest difficulty he found amusing without _bothering_ people. He quite monomania proposing troublesome "larks" inconvenient moments; his plans thwarted, Æolian harp cheerful compared tone which, arguing lamenting, he "Fought his battles again," distraction every occupied member household. When lords creation ages find nothing else do, generally take eating drinking; came pass hero set his mind upon brewing jorum punch, sipping accompaniment mince-pies; Paterfamilias quietly settled his writing half-an-hour, he disturbed application necessary ingredients. These he refused, quietly explaining he could afford waste his French brandy, etc., school-boy cookery, ending with, "You see reason, dear boy?" To dear boy replied above, concluded disrespectful (not say ungrateful) hint, "Old Brown never blows sort thing; he likes Adolphus enjoy holidays." Whereupon Paterfamilias made answer, mildly deprecating tone elder sometimes answer younger topsy-turvy days:-- "That is quite different case. Do not see, boy, Adolphus Brown son, nine brothers sisters? If punch mince-meat play with, reason Tom it, James, Edward, William, Benjamin, Jack. And sisters. Twice amount Browns' mince-meat would serve you. I like enjoy holidays much young Brown anybody; must remember I send boys good schools, give substantial comforts advantages power; Christmas bills heavy, I great many calls purse; must reasonable. Do not see?" "Well, father--" began boy; his father interrupted him. He knew unvarying beginning long grumble, dreading argument, cut short. "I decided. You must amuse way. And remember young Brown's quite another case. He son." Whereupon Paterfamilias went his study his sermon; his son, like Princess Andersen's story Swineherd, left outside sing, "O dearest Augustine, All's clean gone away!" Not he say that--that princess' song--what he said was, "_I wish I son!_" This rather vain wish, round dining-room fire (where he soon joined them) gathered his nine brothers sisters, who, say truth, looking much lively cheerful he. And yet (of days year doleful dissatisfied!) Christmas Eve. Now I know idea dulness discomfort Christmas improper one, particularly story. We know every little boy story-book spends Christmas holidays. First, large hamper good things sent grandpapa, inexhaustible Fortunatus's purse, contains everything, Norfolk turkey grapes grandpaternal vinery. There friend gives guinea member family, sees spend best. There godpapas godmammas, might almost fairy sponsors number expensive gifts bring upon scene. The uncles aunts also liberal. One night devoted magic-lantern (which perfect focus), another pantomime, third celebrated conjuror, fourth Christmas tree juvenile ball. The happy youth makes sufficiently ill plum-pudding, testify reader good was, much it; recovers time fall victim negus trifle supper reason. He neither fatigued late hours surfeited sweets; he is, hear it. But strictly candid history, I confess truth, behalf hero his brothers sisters. They spent morning decorating old church, pricking holly house, making mistletoe bush. Then afternoon tasted Christmas soup seen given out; put finishing touch snow man crowning holly, dragged yule-logs home carpenter's. And now, early tea over, Paterfamilias gone finish his sermon to-morrow; his friend shut his room; Materfamilias hers, one painful headaches even Christmas always keep away. So ten children left amuse themselves, found rather difficult matter. "Here is nice Christmas!" said hero. He turned his youngest brother arm-chair, lying his legs side. "Here is nice Christmas! A fellow might well school. I wonder Adolphus Brown would think cooped lot children like this! It is his party to-night, he is champagne ices. I wish I son." "Thank you," said chorus voices floor. They sprawling hearth-rug, pushing struggling like many kittens sack, every grumbled remonstrance:-- "Do not, Jack! you are treading me." "You need not take fire, Tom." "Keep legs yourself, Benjamin." "It was not I," etc., occasionally feebler cry small sister-- "Oh! boys rough." "And girls, I wonder?" inquired proprietor arm-chair cutting irony. "Whiney piney, whiney piney. I wish things brothers sisters!" "_You wish_ WHAT?" said voice shadow door, deep impressive ghost Hamlet. The ten sprang up; figure came fire-light, saw ghost, Paterfamilias's old college friend, spent his time abroad, who, home relatives his own, come spend Christmas his friend's vicarage. "You wish _what_?" he repeated. "Well, brothers sisters bore," reply. "One two would well; look, ten us; spoils everything. If fellow wants go anywhere, it is somebody else's _turn_. If old Brown sends basket grapes, it is share share alike; ten must taste, there is grape half each. If anybody calls comes luncheon, whole lot brats swarming about, looking kept school. Whatever one does, rest must do; whatever is, rest must share; whereas, fellow son, he would whole--and rules arithmetic, one better tenth." "And rules ten better one," said friend. "Sold again," sang Master Jack floor, went head heels fender. His brother boxed his ears great promptitude, went on, "Well, I do not care; confess, sir, is not rather nuisance?" Paterfamilias's friend looked grave, said, quietly, "I do not think I able judge. I never brother sister one, he drowned sea. Whatever I had, I whole of, would given away willingly one give to. If one sent grapes, I ate alone. If I made anything, one show to. If I wanted act, I must act characters, audience. I remember I got lot sticks last, cut heads faces them, carved names sides, called brothers sisters. If want know I thought nice number fellow have, I say I remember carving twenty-five. I used stick ground talk them. I only, lonely, alone, life, never felt nuisance speak of." This funny account; speaker looked far funny one sisters, tender-hearted, crept him, said, gently-- "Richard joking; he does not really want get rid us. The day curate said he wished he sister, Richard offered sell us ninepence; he fun. Only rather slow now, boys get rather cross; least, us do." "It is dreadful state things," said friend, smiling his black beard moustachios. "What done?" "I know would nice," insinuated young lady. "What?" "If would not mind telling us short story till supper-time. The boys like stories." "That is good idea," said Benjamin. "As girls did not!" But friend proclaimed order, seated girl question his knee. "Well, sort story be?" "Any sort," said Richard; "only true, please. I do not like stories like tracts. There usher school I at, he used read tracts good boys bad boys fellows Sunday afternoon. He always took real names, put names fellows instead. Those done well week he put good ones, had not bad. He did not like me, I always put bad boy, I came many untimely ends I got sick it. I hanged twice, transported sheep-stealing; I committed suicide one week, broke bank next; I ruined three families, became hopeless drunkard, broke hearts twelve distinct parents. I used beg let reformed next week; he said he never would till I Cæsar better. So, please, we will story cannot true." "Very well," said friend, laughing; "but is not true, may I put in? All best writers, know, draw characters friends now-a-days. May I put in?" "Oh, certainly!" said Richard, placing front fire, putting his feet hob, stroking his curls air seemed imply whatever he put would highly favoured. The rest struggled, pushed, squeezed modest equally comfortable quarters; moments thought, Paterfamilias's friend commenced story MELCHIOR'S DREAM. "Melchior hero. He was--well, he considered young man, consider too. He perfect; days taste heroes good deal imperfection, say wickedness. He son. On contrary, he great many brothers sisters, found quite objectionable friend Richard does." "I smell moral," murmured said Richard. "Your scent must keen," said story-teller, "for long way off. Well, he never felt objectionable one particular night, when, house full company, decided boys sleep 'barracks,' called it; is, one large room." "Thank goodness, come that!" said incorrigible Richard; he reduced order threats turned out, contented burning soles his boots bars grate silence: friend continued:-- "But worst. Not he, Melchior, sleep room his brothers, his bed longest largest, his youngest brother sleep end it--foot foot. True, means he got another pillow, for, course, little Hop-of-my-Thumb could without one, he took his; but, spite this, he determined that, sooner submit indignity, he would sit night. Accordingly, rest fast asleep, Melchior, his boots his waistcoat easily unbuttoned, sat fire long lumber-room served night 'barracks'. He refused eat supper downstairs mark his displeasure, repaid stolen meal according his taste. He got pork-pie, little bread cheese, large onions roast, couple raw apples, orange, papers soda tartaric acid compound effervescing draughts. When dainties finished, he proceeded warm beer pan, ginger, spice, sugar, lay back his chair sipped slowly, gazing him, thinking his misfortunes. "The night wore on, fire got lower lower, still Melchior sat, his eyes fixed dirty old print hung mantelpiece years, sipping his 'brew', fast getting cold. The print represented old man light costume, scythe one hand hour-glass other; underneath picture flourishing capitals word TIME. "'You are nice old beggar,' said Melchior, dreamily. 'You look like old hay-maker come work his shirt-sleeves, forgotten rest his clothes. Time! time went tailor's, I think.' "This irreverent; Melchior respectful mood; old man, he calm philosopher. "The night wore on, fire got lower lower, last went altogether. "'How stupid mended it!' said Melchior; he mended it, nothing go bed; bed he went accordingly. "'But I will not go sleep,' he said; 'no, no; I shall keep awake, to-morrow shall know I bad night.' "So he lay bed his eyes wide open, staring still old print, he could see his bed light candle, he left alight mantelpiece keep awake. The flame waved down, room draughty; lights shadows passed old man's face, Melchior almost fancied nodded him, he nodded back again; tired he shut his eyes seconds. When he opened again, longer doubt--the old man's head moving; his head, his legs, his whole body. Finally, he put his feet frame, prepared step right mantelpiece, candle, all. "'Take care,' Melchior tried say, 'you will set fire shirt.' But he could utter sound; old man arrived safely floor, he seemed grow larger larger, till he fully size man, still scythe hour-glass, airy costume. Then he came across room, sat Melchior's bedside. "'Who you?' said Melchior, feeling rather creepy. "'TIME,' said his visitor deep voice, sounded came distance. "'Oh, sure, yes! In copper-plate capitals.' "'What is copper-plate capitals?' inquired Time. "'Your name, print.' "'Very likely,' said Time. "Melchior felt uneasy. 'You must cold,' he said. 'Perhaps would feel warmer went back picture.' "'Not all,' said Time; 'I come purpose see you.' "'I pleasure knowing you,' said Melchior, trying keep his teeth chattering. "'There many people personal acquaintance me,' said his visitor. 'You advantage--I godfather.' "'Indeed,' said Melchior; 'I never heard it.' "'Yes,' said his visitor; 'and find great advantage.' "'Would like put coat?' said Melchior, trying civil. "'No, thank you,' answer. 'You want yourself. We must driving soon.' "'Driving!' said Melchior. "'Yes,' answer;  world driving; must drive; come brothers sisters.' "Melchior sat up; were, sure enough, dressed, climbing one bed--_his_ bed! "There little minx sister her curls (he always called carrot shavings), conceited (girls always are!) always trying attract notice, spite Melchior's incessant snubbings. There clever brother, his untidy hair bent shoulders, bad way; always ran back door visitors called, ever moping reading: this, spite Melchior's hiding his books, continually telling he disgrace family, perfect bear, fit seen, etc.--all laudable desire his improvement. There little Hop-of-my-Thumb, lively them, young monkey, worst all; always mischief, consorting low boys village; though Melchior fail tell he fit company gentlemen's sons, he certain cut he went school, he would probably end his days transported, hanged. There second brother, Melchior's chief companion, he particular quarrel. And little pale lame sister, he dearly loved; whom, odd say, he never tried improve all; his remedy her failings generally, 'Let her she likes, you?' There others tiresome respective ways; one climbed up. "'What doing, getting bed!' inquired indignant brother, soon he could speak. "'Do not know difference bed coach, godson?' said Time, sharply. "Melchior retort, looking round, he saw really large sort coach wide windows. 'I thought I bed,' he muttered. 'What I dreaming of?' "'What, indeed!' said godfather. 'But, quick, sit close, get in; brothers sisters.' "'Must families together?' inquired Melchior, dolefully. "'Yes, first,' answer; 'they get separated time. In fact, everyone cease driving sooner later. I drop road different stages, according orders,' he showed bundle papers his hands; 'but, I favour you, I tell confidence I drop brothers sisters you. There, four oldest sit side, five others there, little one must stand nursed.' "'Ugh!' said Melchior, 'the coach would well enough one alone; squeeze brats! I say, go pretty quick, you?' "'I will,' said Time, 'if wish it. But, beware cannot change mind. If I go quicker sake, I shall never go slow again; slower, I shall go quick; I favour far, godson. Here, take check-string; want me, pull it, speak tube. Now we are off.' "Whereupon old man mounted box, took reins. He whip; he wanted start, he shook hour-glass, went. Then Melchior saw road driving broad, filled vehicles kinds he could see hedges. The noise crowd dust great; Melchior seemed delightfully exciting. There every sort conveyance, grandest coach humblest donkey-cart; seemed enough escape run over. Among gay people many he knew; nice thing seemed drive among grandees, show his handsome face window, bow smile his acquaintance. Then appeared fashion wrap oneself tiger-skin rug, look life opera-glass, old Time kindly put one coach. "But Melchior much troubled his brothers sisters. Just moment he wishing look fashionable elegant, one would pull away rug, drop glass, quarrel, romp, something spoilt effect. In fact, one all, 'just spoilt everything;' he scolded, worse became. The 'minx' shook her curls, flirted window handsome ill-tempered looking man fine horse, praised her 'golden locks,' he called them; and, oddly enough, Melchior said man lout, locks question corkscrewy carrot shavings, she seemed like man his compliments more. Meanwhile, untidy brother pored his book, he came window, ridicule fine ladies gentlemen, Melchior sent Coventry. Then Hop-of-my-Thumb taken make signs exchange jokes disreputable-looking youths dog-cart; his brother would put 'sit still like gentleman' bottom coach, he seemed positively prefer his low companions; rest little better. "Poor Melchior! Surely never clearer case young gentleman's comfort destroyed, solely people's perverse determination happy way instead his. Surely, young gentleman ever knew better his brothers sisters would yield his wishes, would quarrel; ever completely overlooked fact, he yielded happy result might attained. At last he lost patience, pulling check-string, bade Godfather Time drive fast he could. "'For,' said he, 'there never peace many us coach; fellow rug glass, and, indeed, coach himself, he might drive bow talk best them; is, one might well go wild-beast caravan.' "Godfather Time frowned, shook his glass same, away went famous pace. All came stop. "'Now it,' says Melchior; 'here goes one rate.' "Time called name second brother his shoulder; boy stood up, bade his brothers sisters good-bye. "'It time I began push way world,' said he, passed coach, among crowd. "'You taken quiet boy,' said Melchior godfather angrily. 'Drive fast now, pity's sake; let us get rid tiresome ones.' "And fast enough drove, dropped first one other; sisters, reading boy, youngest still remained. "'What looking at?' said Melchior lame sister. "'At strange figure crowd,' she answered. "'I see nothing,' said Melchior. But looking while, he see figure wrapped cloak, gliding among people, unnoticed, unseen. "'Who it?' Melchior asked godfather. "'A friend mine,' Time answered. 'His name Death.' "Melchior shuddered, especially figure come coach, put hand window, which, his horror, lame sister laid smiled. At moment coach stopped. "'What doing?' shrieked Melchior, 'Drive on! drive on!' "But even he sprang seize check-string door opened, pale sister's face (a little paler now) dropped upon shoulder figure cloak, he carried her away; Melchior stormed raved vain. "'To take her, leave rest! Cruel! cruel!' "In his rage grief, he hardly knew untidy brother called, putting his book his arm, slipped coach without looking right left. Presently coach stopped again; Melchior looked door open, fine man fine horse, lifting sister saddle him. 'What fool's game playing?' said Melchior, angrily. 'I know man. He ill-tempered bad character.' "'You never told her before,' muttered young Hop-of-my-Thumb. "'Hold tongue,' said Melchior. 'I forbade her talk him, enough.' "'I do not want leave you; he cares me, do not,' sobbed sister; she carried away. "When she gone, youngest brother slid his corner came Melchior. "'We alone now, Brother,' he said; 'let us good friends. May I sit front seat you, half rug? I good polite, nothing fellows, talk me.' "Now Melchior really rather liked idea, his brother seemed submissive mood, he thought he would take opportunity giving good lecture, would graciously relent forgive. So he began asking he thought he fit company (Melchior), he thought gentlefolks would say boy playing youths young Hop-of-my-Thumb had, whether said youths scoundrels? And boy refused say (for kind him), Melchior said his tastes evidently bad ever, even hinted old transportation threat. This much; boy went angrily back his window corner, Melchior--like many us!--lost opportunity making peace sake wagging his tongue. "'But he come round minutes,' he thought A minutes passed, however, sign. A minutes more, noise, shout; Melchior looked up, saw boy jumped open window road, picked men dog-cart, gone. "And last hero alone. At first he enjoyed much. He shook his hair, wrapped rug, stared opera-glass, fine gentleman well indeed. But though everyone allowed finest young fellow road, yet nobody seemed care fact much he did; talked, complimented, stared him, he got tired it. For he could arrange his hair better; he could dispose rug gracefully, stare perseveringly glass; he could, his friends could nothing done. In fact, he got tired crowd, found gazing window, see his fine friends, try catch sight his brothers sisters. Sometimes he saw youngest brother, looking time wild reckless; sometimes sister, looking miserable; he saw one else. "At last stir among people, heads turned towards distance, looking something. Melchior asked was, told people looking man, hero many battles, honour his country foreign lands, coming home. Everybody stood gazed, Melchior them. Then crowd parted, hero came on. No one asked whether he handsome genteel, whether he kept good company, wore tiger-skin rug, looked opera-glass? They knew he _done_, enough. "He bronzed hairy man, one sleeve empty, breast covered stars; his face, brown sun wind, overgrown hair scarred wounds, Melchior saw his second brother! There doubt it. And brother himself, though he bowed kindly answer greetings showered him, gazing anxiously old coach, he used ride uncomfortable, time he looked back happiest his life. "'I thank you, gentlemen. I indebted you, gentlemen. I away long. I going home.' "'Of course he is!' shouted Melchior, waving his arms widely pride joy. 'He coming home; coach, he was--oh, seems hour ago! Time goes fast. We great friends young together. My brother I, ladies gentlemen, hero I--my brother--the hero stars upon his breast--he coming home!' "Alas! avail stars ribbons breast life-blood trickling slowly little wound? The crowd looked anxious; hero came on, slowly, his dim eyes straining old coach; Melchior stood his arms held silent agony. But he beginning hope, brothers seemed meet, figure passed between--a figure cloak. "'I seen many times, Friend, face face,' said hero; 'but I would fain waited little while.' "'To enjoy his well-earned honours,' murmured crowd. "'Nay,' he said, 'not that; see home, brothers sisters. But may be, friend Death, I ready, tired too.' With he held his hand, Death lifted hero many battles like child, carried away, stars ribbons all. "'Cruel Death!' cried Melchior; 'was one else crowd, must take him?' "His friends condoled him; soon went ways; hero seemed forgotten; Melchior, lost pleasure old bowings chattings, sat sadly gazing window, see he could see one he cared. At last, grave dark man, sitting horse, making speech crowd, he recognized his clever untidy brother. "'What man talking about?' he asked one near him. "'That man!' answer. 'Do not know? He _the_ man time. He philosopher. Everybody goes hear him. He found that--well--that everything mistake.' "'Has he corrected it?' said Melchior. "'You better hear yourself,' said man. 'Listen.' "Melchior listened, cold clear voice rang upon his ear, saying:-- "'The world fools go ever done; wise few, I address myself, I would say--Shake ever fancies feelings, creeds customs shackle you, true. We come time wise men led blindfold footsteps predecessors, tear away bandage see themselves. I torn away mine, looked. There Faith--it shaken rotten foundation; Hope--it disappointed every day; Love all. There nothing man each, his fate; he happiest wisest meet unmoved.' "'It lie!' shouted Melchior. 'I feel heart. A wicked foolish lie! Oh! teach evil folly left home us, brother? Oh, come back! come back!' "The philosopher turned his head coldly, smiled. 'I thank gentleman spoke,' he said, still cold voice, 'for his bad opinion, his good wishes. I think gentleman spoke home kindred. My experience life led find home valued left, kindred dear parted. I happily freed inconsistencies. I glad know fate tear place I care next shall deposit me, take away friends I value leaves. I recommend similar self-emancipation gentleman honour speaking.' "With philosopher went his way, crowd followed him. "'There separation bitter death,' said Melchior. "At last he pulled check-string, called Godfather Time humble entreating voice. "'It fault,' he began; 'it fault, Godfather; drive altogether wrong. Let us turn back begin again. Let us get afresh begin again.' "'But squeeze brats!' said Godfather Time, ironically. "'We happy,' murmured Melchior, humbly; 'and cold chilly; keep warm.' "'You tiger-skin rug opera-glass, know,' said Time. "'Ah, speak me!' cried Melchior, earnestly. 'I thinking them. There plenty room; little one sit knee; shall happy. The truth is, Godfather, I wrong. I gone wrong way work. A little love, kindness, forbearance, might kept sisters us, might led little one better tastes pleasures, taught experience truth faith hope love he reviles. Oh, I sinned! I sinned! Let us turn back, Godfather Time, begin again. And oh! drive slowly, partings come soon.' "'I sorry,' said old man bitter tone before, 'to disappoint rather unreasonable wishes. What say admirably true, misfortune, good intentions late. Like rest world ready seize opportunity past. You kind _then_. You advised _then_. You yielded _then_. You loved brothers sisters them. It late now.' "With he drove on, spoke more, poor Melchior stared sadly window. As he gazing crowd, he suddenly saw dog-cart, his brother his wretched companions. Oh, old worn he looked! ragged his clothes were! The men seemed trying persuade something he like, began quarrel; midst dispute he turned his head caught sight old coach; Melchior seeing this, waved his hands, beckoned his might. The brother seemed doubtful; Melchior waved harder, (was fancy?) Time seemed go slower. The brother made his mind; he turned jumped dog-cart he jumped old coach long ago, ducking among horses carriages, ran his life. The men came him; he ran like wind--pant, pant, nearer, nearer; last coach reached, Melchior seized prodigal his rags dragged in. "'Oh, thank GOD, I got safe, brother!' "But brother! wasted body sunken eyes; old curly hair turned matted locks, clung faster his face rags his trembling limbs; sight opera-glasses crowd! What subject tongues ever wagging, complimenting, backbiting, lying, breath, without sense scruple! What sight subject fine friends, whose good opinion Melchior anxious? Do think he anxious now? Do think he troubled either saw said; ashamed wretched prodigal lying among cushions? I think not. I think foolish us moments life (of real joy real sorrow) judge things higher standard, care vastly little 'people say'. The shame Melchior felt his brother fared hardly trials temptations world outside, he sat ease among cushions old coach, home alike. Thank GOD, home now! And poor Hop-of-my-Thumb front seat last, Melchior kneeling his feet, fondly stroking head rested him. "'Has powder come fashion, brother?' he said. 'Your hair streaked white.' "'If has,' said other, laughing, 'your barber better mine, Melchior, head white snow.' "'Is possible? old? Time gone fast? But staring window? I shall jealous crowd, brother.' "'I looking crowd,' said prodigal low voice; 'but I see--' "'You see what?' said Melchior. "'A figure cloak, gliding out--' "Melchior sprang horror. 'No! no!' he cried, hoarsely. 'No! surely no!' "Surely yes! Too surely well-known figure came on; prodigal's sunken eyes looked sunken still he gazed. As Melchior, he neither spoke moved, stood silent agony, terrible see. All thought seemed strike him; he seized his brother, pushed furthest corner seat, planted firmly door Death came put his hand coach. Then he spoke low steady voice, piteous cries tears. "'I humbly beseech you, good Death, must take one us, take me. I long drive, many comforts blessings, willing unworthy go. He suffered much, pleasure; leave little enjoy drive peace, little; he suffered much, I much blame; let go instead him.' "Alas Melchior! It decreed Providence GOD, that, although opportunities good, power every man, beyond count knowledge, yet, opportunity neglected, man self-sacrifice atone fallen suffered his negligence. Poor Melchior! An unalterable law made powerless spectator consequences his neglected opportunities. 'No man may deliver his brother, make agreement unto GOD him, cost redeem souls, he must let alone ever.' And ever bitter 'let alone,' case might acted not? "Poor Melchior! In vain he laid his hands Death's outstretched palm; fell passed air; he pushed aside--Death passed coach--'one taken left.' "As cloaked figure glided among crowd, many turned look his sad burden, though heeded him. Much said; general voice crowd this: 'Ah! he gone, he? Well! born rascal! It must great relief his brother!' A conclusion wise, near truth, world's conclusions generally are. As Melchior, he neither saw figure heard crowd, he fallen senseless among cushions. "When he came his senses, he found lying still upon his face; bitter his loneliness grief, he lay still move. He astonished, however, (as seemed him) unusual silence. The noise carriages deafening, sound. Was he deaf? crowd gone? He opened his eyes. Was he blind? night come? He sat right up, shook himself, looked again. The crowd _was_ gone; so, matter that, coach; Godfather Time. He lying among cushions, among pillows; he vehicle kind, bed. The room dark, still; 'barracks' window, blind, he saw winter sun pushing mist, like red hot cannon-ball hanging frosty trees; yard outside, cocks crowing. "There longer doubt he safe his old home; his brothers sisters? With beating heart he crept end bed; lay prodigal, haggard cheeks sunken eyes, grey locks miserable rags, rosy yellow-haired urchin fast asleep, his head upon his arm. 'I took his pillow,' muttered Melchior, self-reproachfully. "A minutes later, young Hop-of-my-Thumb (whom Melchior dared lose sight fear he melt away) seated comfortably his brother's back, wrapped blanket, making tour 'barracks.' "'It is awful lark,' said he, shivering mixture cold delight. "If exactly _lark_, happy tour Melchior, as, hope gradually changing certainty, he recognized his brothers one shapeless lump little beds. There were, sleeping peacefully happy home, embryo hero embryo philosopher, lay invariable book upon his pillow, his hair looking (as always did) he lived high wind. "'I say,' whispered Melchior, pointing him, 'what he say day parson?' "'He said he like one,' returned Hop-of-my-Thumb; 'but said he would frighten away congregation his looks. And then, know, he got angry, said he did not know priests need dandies, everybody humbuggy alike, thought nothing looks; he would philosopher like Diogenes, cared nobody, ugly ape, lived tub.' "'He make capital parson,' said Melchior, hastily, 'and I shall tell to-morrow. And I am squire here, he shall vicar, I will subscribe his dodges without grumble. I am eldest son. And, I say, do not think could brush his hair morning, till he learns himself?' "'Oh, I will!' lively answer; 'I am awful dab brushing. Look I brush best hat!' "'True,' said Melchior. 'Where girls to-night?' "'In little room end long passage,' said Hop-of-my-Thumb, trembling increased chilliness enjoyment. 'But you are never going there! shall wake company, come see what is matter.' "'I should not care did,' said Melchior, 'it would make feel real.' "As he understand sentiment, Hop-of-my-Thumb said nothing, held tightly; crept softly cold grey passage dawn. The girls' door open; girls afraid robbers, left bed-room door wide open night, natural obvious means self-defence. The girls slept together; frill pale sister's prim little night-cap buried one's uncovered curls. "'How tremble!' whispered Hop-of-my-Thumb; 'are cold?' This inquiry received answer; minutes he spoke again. 'I say, pretty look! do not they?' "But reason other, Melchior seemed lost his voice; he stooped kissed girls gently, two brothers crept back along passage 'barracks.' "'One thing more,' said Melchior; went mantelpiece. 'I lend bow arrows to-morrow, one condition--' "'Anything!' reply, enthusiastic whisper. "'That take old picture target, never let see again.' "It ungrateful! perfection man; something Melchior's muttered excuse-- "'I could not stand another night it.' "Hop-of-my-Thumb speedily put bed again, get warm, time pillows; Melchior restless sleep, he resolved shower-bath, dress. After which, he knelt window, covered his face his hands. "'He is saying long prayers,' thought Hop-of-my-Thumb, glancing his warm nest; 'and jolly humour he morning!' "Still young head bent, handsome face hidden; Melchior finding his life every moment real happy. For hardly thing, well-filled 'barracks' brother bedfellow, hardship last night, morning seem blessing. He rose last, stood sunshine, pouring in; smile his lips, his face two drops, which, water, come shower-bath, bath all." * * * * * "Is end?" inquired young lady his knee, story teller paused here. "Yes, end." "It is beautiful story," she murmured, thoughtfully; "but extraordinary one! I do not think I could dreamt wonderful dream." "Do think could eaten wonderful supper?" said friend, twisting his moustachios. After point, evening's amusements thoroughly successful. Richard took his smoking boots fire-place, called upon various entertainments he famous: accurate imitation train starting, two pieces bone used considerable effect; also bumble-bee, (very much season) went buzzing about, always caught heavy bang heads shoulders least expected it; specimens his talents received due applause his admiring brothers sisters. The bumble-bee caught (for twenty-first time) loud smack brother Benjamin's ear, door opened, Paterfamilias entered Materfamilias (whose headache better), followed candles. A fresh log thrown upon fire, yule cakes furmety put upon table, everybody drew round supper; Paterfamilias announced although he could give materials play with, he objection bowl moderate punch all, Richard might compound it. This delightful; he sat his father, ladling away rest, Adolphus Brown could hardly felt jovial, even champagne ices. The rest sat radiant faces shining heads goodly order; bottom table, Materfamilias, friend, happy his unselfish sympathy his twenty-five sticks come life, supping him. As happy--nearly--as certain woman's grave never dug southern sun could save her, children gathered round whose faces he often dreamt, might never see. His health drunk, everybody else's too, when, supper coming close, Richard (who sitting thoughtful silence minutes) got sudden resolution, said, "I want propose Mr. What is-his-name's health account. I want thank his story, one mistake it. Melchior kept effervescing papers put beer; it is splendid drink! Otherwise first-rate; though hit rather hard. I want say though I did not mean I said son (when fellow gets put he does not know he means), yet I know I quite wrong, story quite right. I want particularly say I am glad many us, more, know, merrier. I would not change father mother, brothers sisters, one world. It could not better, could not happier. We together, to-morrow Christmas Day. Thank GOD." It well said. It good speech. It well good blessings him, he could feel so, grateful. It well, good also, friend, neither home kindred grateful for, something else he could thank GOD heartily. The thought something came he sat his friend's table, filling his eyes tears. It came next day he knelt GOD's altar, remembering blessed fellowship deed love foundation hope joy. It came he went back his lonely wandering life, thought tender interest boyish speech. It came--a whisper consolation silence envy regret ever. "There _is_ something far better. There _is_ something far happier. There better Home earthly one, Family shall never divided." THE BLACKBIRD'S NEST. "Let think action mine way, But Thy love shall sway, Resigning rudder Thy skill." GEORGE HERBERT. One day, I little girl (which long time ago), I made discovery. The place I made remote, holly-bush bottom garden; discovery great one itself, though I thought grand. I found blackbird's nest, three young ones it. The discovery made wise. I sitting one morning log wood opposite holly-bush, reading story Goody Twoshoes, thinking much I like like her, go village raven, pigeon, lark shoulders, admired talked everybody. All sorts nonsense passed head I sat, book lap, staring straight me; I fancying kind condescension I would behave everybody I became Goody Twoshoes, I saw bird come holly-bush fly away. It blackbird: doubt it; must nest tree, long? Down went book, I flew make discovery. A blackbird's nest, three young ones! I stood still first pure pleasure sight; then, little little, grand ideas came head. I would kind little blackbirds, I thought; I would take home cold tree, make large nest cotton wool (which would much softer better were), feed them, keep them; then, full-grown, would, course, love better one, tame grateful; I walk shoulders, like Goody Twoshoes, admired everybody; for, I ashamed say, day dreams ended this, _to admired everybody_. I wrapped thoughts I know, till his hands laid upon shoulders, friend, curate village, come behind me. He lived next door us, often climbed wall divided garden bring flowers little bed. He tall, dark, young man; best hand making fire-balloons, mending toys, making broken wax doll good new hot knitting needle, imagine. I heard grown-up people call grave silent, he always laughed talked me. "What doing, little woman?" he said. "I got nest poor little birds," I answered; "I sorry cold; right I got indoors. I shall make beautiful nest cotton wool, feed them. Will not nice?" I spoke confidently; I really worked fancy I felt quite contemptuous pity wretched little birds hatched every year without rear them. At time, I general idea grown-up people always _did_ throw cold water splendid plans like mine; I indignant surprised friend curate tried show quite impossible I wished. The end his arguments I must leave nest place. But I great turn disputing, inclined give point. "You told Sunday," I said, pertly, "that never little kind things; let this." "If I could sure," he said, looking me, "that wish kind thing." I got angry rude. "Perhaps think I want kill them," I said. He answer, taking hands his, said, gravely, "Tell me, child, wish most--to kind poor little birds? honour glory them, bringing up?" "To kind them," said I, getting red. "I do not want honour glory," I felt ready cry. "Well, well," he said, smiling; "then I know believe I tell kindest thing little birds leave are. And like, come sit every day till able fly, keep watch nest, naughty boy may come near it--the curate, instance!" he pulled funny face. "That kind." "But never know, I want like me," said I. "I thought wanted kind," he answered. And he began talk gently different sorts kindness, I wished kind like Christian, I must kind without hoping reward, whether gratitude anything else. He told best followers Jesus times tried hard everything, however small, simply GOD's sake, put away. That often began even letters, etc., words, as, "Glory GOD," remind everything did, perfect, must done GOD, GOD alone. And good kind things even, afraid lest, though thing right, wish might come conceit presumption. "This self-devotion," he added, "is highest Christian life, seems, I dare say, hard even understand, much put practice. But must try best way can, little woman; GOD's grace really practised it, almost impossible downcast disappointed already Heaven. They wished nothing happen GOD's will; nothing GOD's glory. And good bishop says, 'I end, whether I succeed disappointed.' So end, child, kind little birds right way, denying yourself, whether know not." I could understood he said; I afraid I try understand I might done; however, I said more, stood silent, he comforted promise new flower garden, called "hen chickens," he said I take care instead little blackbirds. When he gone I went back holly-bush, stood gazing nest, nursing angry thoughts heart. "What _preach_," I thought, "about nothing! could conceit presumption taking care three poor little birds! The curate must forget I growing big girl; knowing feed them, I knew well he birds lived upon worms, liked bread-crumbs." And _thinking wrong_ ended (as almost always does) _doing wrong_: I took three little blackbirds nest, popped pocket-handkerchief, ran home. And I took trouble keep everyone is sight--even mother's; I want hear "grown-up" opinions matter. I filled basket cotton wool, put birds inside, took little room downstairs, would warm. Before I went bed I put two three worms, large supply soaked bread-crumbs, nest, close little beaks. "What want more?" thought I folly; conscience apt restless one young, I could feel quite comfortable bed, though I got sleep last, trying fancy Goody Twoshoes, three sleek full-fledged blackbirds shoulders. In morning, soon I could slip away, I went pets. Any one may guess I found; I believe one understand shock agony remorse I felt. There lay worms I dug reckless cruelty; wasted bread; there, all, lay three little blackbirds, cold dead! I know long I stood looking victims presumptuous wilfulness; last I heard footstep passage, fearing caught, I tore house, old seat near holly-bush, I flung ground, "wept bitterly." At last I heard well-known sound one climbing wall; curate stood me, plant "hen chickens" his hands. I jumped up, shrank away him. "Do not come near me," I cried; "the blackbirds dead;" I threw again. I knew experience things roused anger friend strongly see hear animals ill-treated. I never forgotten, one day I him, his wrath boy cruelly beating donkey; I felt, though I could see, expression his face, he looked holly-bush me, exclaimed, "You took them!" And added, low tone he always spoke angry, "And mother-bird wandering night round tree, seeking her little ones vain, comforted, not! Child, child! GOD Father given life His creatures destroy reckless manner?" His words cut heart like knife; I utterly wretched already much miserable; I lay still moaned. At last he took pity, lifting his knee, endeavoured comfort me. This not, however, easy matter. I knew much better he naughty I been; I felt I murdered poor tender little birds. "I never, never, forgive myself!" I sobbed. "But must reasonable," he said. "You gave way vanity wilfulness, persuaded wished kind blackbirds; punished. Is so?" "O yes!" I cried; "I wicked! I wish I good are!" "As I am!"--he began. I young understand sharp tone self-reproach he spoke. In eyes he perfection; perhaps little _too_ good. But he went on:-- "Do know, fault reminds time I wilful conceited, much bent upon great duty helping others grand fashion, rather humble way GOD's Providence pointed out, much serious matter; I older, too, less excuse. I almost tempted tell it; cases really quite alike, punishment met sin unspeakably bitter comparison yours, may thankful learnt lesson humility smaller cost." I understand him--in fact, I understand many things he said, he habit talking he speaking himself; I general idea his meaning, said (very truly), "I cannot fancy wrong." I puzzled curious expression his face; he said, "Shall I tell story?" I knew his stories old, gave eager "Yes." "It sad one," he said. "I think I like funny one now," I replied. "Is true?" "Quite," he answered. "It myself." He silent moments, making his mind speak; then, laying his head, he sometimes did, shoulder, I could see his face, he began. "When I boy (older you, I ought better), I might described words Scripture--I 'the son mother, she widow.' We badly off, she delicate, nay, ill--more ill, GOD knows, I idea of. I long used sight doctor twice week, her sometimes better sometimes worse; old servant lectured making noise, doctor begged she might excited worried, I fancied doctors nurses always say things sort, particular need attend them. "Not I unfeeling dear mother, I loved her devotedly wilful worldly way. It her sake I vexed poverty father's death plunged us. For her sake I worried her, grumbling her narrow lodgings lost comforts. For her sake, child, madness, I wasted hours I might soothed, comforted, waited her, dreaming wild schemes making famous rich, giving her back she lost. For her sake I fancied pouring money her feet, loading her luxuries, she praying common Father, laying treasure herself Heaven. "One day I remember, she remonstrating bad report schoolmaster given (he said I could work, would not), vanity overcame prudence, I told her I thought fellows made 'fag,' not; I writing poem dictionary day I done badly, I hoped poet long master composed grammar. I see her sorrowful face as, tears her eyes, she told 'fellows' alike made duty 'before GOD, Angels, Men.' That improving little events opportunities every day men became great, neglecting presumptuous fancies. And she entreated strive duty, leave rest GOD. I listened, however, impatiently I called 'jaw' 'scold,' (knowing tender interest she took I did) I tried coax her offering read poem. But she answered severity, she wished see good man, great one; she would rather see exercises duly written fifty poems composed expense neglected duty. Then she warned tenderly misery conceit would bring upon me, bade me, I said evening prayers, add prayer King David, 'Keep Thy servant presumptuous sins, lest get dominion me.' "Alas! got dominion already, strongly her words take hold. 'She will not even look poem,' I thought, hurried proudly room, banging one door leaving another open. And I silenced uneasy conscience fresh dreams making fortune hers. But punishment came last. One day doctor took room alone, told gently he could everyone knew already--my mother dying. I cannot tell you, child, blow fell upon me--how, first, I utterly disbelieved truth! It seemed _impossible_ hope life, object schemes fancies, taken away. But I awakened last, resolved that, GOD helping me, she live, I would better son. I look back thankfulness days together. I never left her. She took her food medicine hand; I received First Communion her day she died. The day before, kneeling her bed, I confessed sin vanity heart miserable dreams; destroyed hand papers, resolved I would apply studies, endeavour obtain scholarship necessary preparation Holy Orders. It ambition, little woman, undertaken humbly, fear GOD, path duty; I accomplished years after, I nothing left mother her memory." The curate silent, I felt, rather saw, tears wetting frock come eyes, though I crying bitterly. I flung arms round his neck, hugged tight. "Oh, I sorry!" I sobbed; "so very, sorry!" We became quieter bit; he lifted his head smiled, called fool making sad, told tell one he told me, babies been, except mother. "Tell her _everything_ always," he said. I soon cheered up, particularly he took wall, his workshop, made coffin poor little blackbirds, lined cotton-wool scented musk, mark respect. Then he dug deep hole garden buried them, made fine high mound earth, put "hen chicken" plants round. And night, sitting mother's knee, I told her "everything," she would tears sorrow repentance her arms. * * * * * Many years passed since then, many showers rain helped lay mound flat earth, "hen chickens" run it, made fine plot. The curate his mother met last; I transplanted many flowers he gave his grave. I sometimes wonder if, his perfect happiness, he knows, cares know, often remembrance his story stopped current conceited day-dreams, brought back practical duty humble prayer, "Keep Thy servant also presumptuous sins." FRIEDRICH'S BALLAD. A TALE OF THE FEAST OF ST. NICHOLAS. "Nè pinger nè scolpir fia più che queti, L'anima volta quell' Amor divino Ch'asserse prender noi Croce le braccia." "Painting Sculpture's aid vain I crave, My one sole refuge Love divine Which Cross stretched forth arms save." _Written by_ MICHAEL ANGELO _at age 83._ "So it," said one council, he rose addressed others. "It finally decided. The Story Woman walled up." The council ecclesiastical one, woman condemned barbarous bygone punishment "walled up" offending nun. In fact Story Woman (or _Märchen-Frau_ she called Germany) may taken represent imaginary personage known England name Mother Bunch, Mother Goose; instance name given certain family children old book ballads poems, accustomed read turn special solemnities, one particular night year; reader time peculiar costume, title "Märchen-Frau," Mother Bunch, name time familiarly adopted ballad-book itself. This book bound fashionable colour, illustrated fashionable artist; Chiswick Press set type it, Hayday's morocco thing unknown. It not, short, one attractions days books surrounded, whose insides always fulfil promise binding. If, however, points inferior modern volumes, others advantage. It share precarious favour dozen rivals mauve, supplanted ere year twelve new ones magenta. It never thrown aside contemptuous remark,--"I have read that!" On contrary, always possessors, (from best Book downwards) good book always be, friend, acquaintance--not readily criticized, loved trusted. The pages yellow worn, profane ill-usage, honourable wear tear; mottled binding presented much appearance might expected book pressed pillow one reader, pocket another; wept laughed over, warmed winter fires, damped summer grass, general seen much life venerable book question. It property one member family, joint possession all. It _mine_, _ours_, inscription, "For Children," written blank leaf testified; inscription hereafter pathetic memorial aged eyes days "the children" yet separated, took pleasures, like meals, together. And this, full consent council owners, _Märchen-Frau_ "walled up." But I attempt explain, way excuse seemingly ungracious act, may well give account doers thereof. Well, then:-- Providence blessed certain respectable tradesman, certain town Germany, large promising family children. He married early beloved his boyhood, left widower one motherless baby almost he man. A neighbour, womanly compassion, took pity upon desolate father, desolate child; she nursed babe her house dangerous sickness, long chief adviser parent, he awoke fact she become necessary him, married. Of union came family eight, two eldest laid turn quiet grave. The others survived, and, first wife's daughter, made goodly family party, sometimes sorely taxed resources tradesman provide for, though his business good his wife careful. They scrambled up, however, children will not circumstances; time story opens youngest turned his back upon babyhood, Marie, eldest, reached pinnacle childish ambition--she "grown up." A good Marie she was, always been; days she ran school little knapsack her back, her fair hair hanging two long plaits, present time, she tenderly fastened knapsack shoulders younger sister; plaits long reclaimed vagrant freedom, coiled close her head. "Our Marie clever," said one children, flattered _he was_ bit genius; "our Marie clever, also she never wrong." It genius story chiefly do. Friedrich child unusual talent; fact which, happily himself, discovered till he twelve years old. He learnt read quickly; he able, read every book he could lay his hands, his father's house number great. When Marie child, school kept certain old man, gentle learned his quiet way. He fond his fair-haired pupil, she longer scholar, passed many odd hour imparting her slight knowledge Latin, great Linnæus' system botany. He dead, his place filled less sympathizing pedagogue; Friedrich listened envious ears his fortunate sister's stories her friend master. "So he taught Latin--that great language! And botany--which science!" child would exclaim envious admiration, he heard thousandth time every particular old schoolmaster's kindness. And Marie would answer calmly, she "refooted" one father's stockings, "We good deal grammar, I fear I forgotten, I learnt heart Psalms Latin, I remember well. Also commenced system Mr. Linnæus, I stupid, ever preferred plates pictured flower gave torn pieces, he thought valuable. But, all, he taught good; though I forgotten many his lessons, words advice his I heeded little then, come back teach now. Father heard Burgomaster say he genius, I know he good, best all;" which, turned heel her stocking, Marie would put reach kitten, lay table dinner. And Friedrich--poor Friedrich!--groaning inwardly his sister's indifference her great opportunities learning, would speculate probable fate volume old schoolmaster's library, sold he, Friedrich, three years old. Thus, circumstances, boy expressed his feelings moderation he said, "Our Marie clever, also she never wrong." If schoolmaster dead, however, Friedrich not, nevertheless, friendless. There certain bookseller his native town, his spare time he ran messages, return glad let spend his playhours half-holidays among books his shop. There, perched top shelves ladder, crouched upon his toes bottom, he devoured volumes dipped others; he liked best poetry, uncommon taste many young readers one mania. Wherever sight verses met his eye, he fastened read greedily. One day, short time story opens, he found, his wanderings shelf shelf, nicely-bound volumes, one he opened, straightway verses attractive-looking metre met his eye, not, however, German, fair round Roman text, and, alas! language he understand. There customers shop, he stood still corner his nose almost resting bookshelf, staring fiercely page, he would force meaning fair clear-looking verses. When last beard vanished doorway, Friedrich came counter, book hand. "Well, now?" said comfortable bookseller, round German smile. "This book," said boy; "in language it?" The man stuck his spectacles his nose, smiled again. "It Italian, sonnets Petrarch, child. The edition fine one, careful." Friedrich went back his place, sighing heavily. After he came again. "Well now, it?" said bookseller, cheerfully. "Have Italian grammar?" "Only this," said other, he picked book shelf laid counter twinkle his eye. The boy opened looked disappointed. "It Italian," said he. "No, no," answer; "it French Italian, printed Paris. But wouldst thou grammar, child?" The boy blushed he caught stealing, said hastily-- "I _must_ read poems, I cannot I learn language." "And thou wouldst read Petrarch grammar," shouted bookseller; "ho! ho! ho!" "And dictionary," said Friedrich; "why not?" "Why not?" repeated other, renewed laughter. "Why not? Because learn language, Friedrich, one must master, exercises, phrase-book, progressive reading-lessons vocabulary; and, short, one must learn language way everybody else learns it; not, Friedrich." "Everybody nobody," said Friedrich, hotly; "at least nobody worth caring for. If I grammar dictionary, I would read beautiful poems." "Hear him!" said cheerful little bookseller. "He read Petrarch. He! If volumes stop shelves till thou canst read them, child--ho! ho! ho!" he rubbed his brushy little beard glee. Friedrich's temper nature calmest, conversation rubbed tenderest points. He answered almost fiercely-- "Take care volumes. If I live, _do_ stop shelves, I buy day. Remember!" he turned sharply round hide tears begun fall. For moment good shopkeeper's little mouth became round his round little eyes his round little face; he laid his hands counter, jumping neatly flung his dead weight Friedrich, embraced heartily. "My poor child! (a kiss)--would pleased Heaven make thee son nobleman--(another kiss). But hear me. A man Berlin compiling Italian grammar. It month two. I shall copy, thou shalt see it; ever thou canst read Petrarch I give thee volumes--(a volley kisses). And now, thou hast stayed long, come little room dine me." With invitation kind-hearted German released his young friend led back room, buried memory Petrarch mess vegetables melted butter. It may added here, Petrarchs remained shelf, years afterwards round-faced little bookseller redeemed his promise pride. Of visits father intents purposes ignorant. He knew Friedrich went see bookseller, bookseller good-natured him; he never dreamt his son read books his neighbour's shop lined, he knew nothing wild visions shop bred nourished mind his boy, made life outside doorstep seem dream. The father son saw life different points view. The boy felt he talented boys, designed poet; tradesman saw boy talented boys, designed business; opposite nature determinations one great misery Friedrich's life. If, however, source child's sorrows secret one, spoken his brothers sisters, even his friend bookseller, equally secret also sources his happiness. No eye his ever beheld scraps paper he begged bookseller, covered childish efforts verse-making. No one shared happiness hours, perhaps quarter spent working poem, three-fourths given day-dreams poet; knew wild fancies his brain made Friedrich's nights happy his days. By day he child (his family, reason, said tiresome one), night he man, great man. He visited courts Europe, received compliments Royalty; _his_ plays acted theatres; _his_ poems stood shelves booksellers; he made his family rich (the boy young wish money himself); he made everybody happy, famous. Fame! word rang his ears danced his eyes hours night wore on, he lived glorious lifetime. And so, mother, candle hand, came round like guardian angel among sleeping children, see "all right," he--poor child!--must feign sleeping his face, hide traces tears he wept he composed epitaph grace monument famous Friedrich ----, poet, philosopher, etc. Whoever doubts possibility exaggerated folly, never known imaginative childhood, wept unreal griefs, less bitter time remembered afterwards mixture shame amusement. Happy unhappy, however, his dreams boy great, enough; Friedrich vain, everyone tempted feels way singular unlike him. He revelled honours he showered upon himself, so--the night happy; so--the day unwelcome he smartly bid get put his stockings, found Fame gone child again, without honour, his country, his father's house. These sad dreams (sad uselessness) destined, however, good last; and, oddly enough, childish council condemned ballad-book decided his fate also. This happened. The children accustomed, said, celebrate Feast St. Nicholas readings beloved book. St. Nicholas's Day (the 6th December) years favourite festival children many parts Continent. In France, children diligently taught St. Nicholas comes night chimney, fills little shoes (which ranged purpose) sweetmeats rods, according his opinion owner's conduct past year. The Saint supposed travel air, followed ass laden two panniers, one contains good things, birch, he leaves his ass top chimney comes alone. The belief entertained Holland; parts Germany he even believed carry bad boys girls his sack, answering respect English Bogy. The day, may supposed, looked forward small amount anxiety; clean tidy little shoes placed young expectants; parents--who threatened promised St. Nicholas's name year past--take care that, one sort present other, shoes well filled. The great question--rods sweetmeats--is, however, finally settled individual breakfast-time great day; dinner, despite maternal warnings, said sweetmeats consumed. And came pass Friedrich his brothers sisters hit upon plan ending day, spirit enjoyment opened. The mother, little kind manoeuvring, generally induced father sup take his evening pipe neighbour, tradesman one whose presence rather "wet blanket" upon innocent folly fun. Then she good-naturedly took herself household matters, children left undisturbed possession stove, round gathered book, game commenced. Each turn read whichever poem he preferred; reader time being, wrapt huge hood cloak, kept purpose, called "Märchen-Frau," Story Woman. Sometimes song chorus, children sang whichever suited best thousand airs always floating German brains. Sometimes, ballad favourite one, others would take part verses contained dialogue. This generally case verses pet ballad Bluebeard, exciting point Sister Anne looking castle window. First Märchen-Frau read sonorous voice-- "Schwester Aennchen, siehst du nichts?" (Sister Anne, see nothing?) Then others replied Anne-- "Stäubchen fliegen, Gräschen wehen." (A little dust flies, little grass waves.) Again Märchen-Frau-- "Aennchen, lässt sich sonst nichts sehen?" (Little Anne, nothing else seen?) And unsatisfactory reply-- "Schwesterchen, sonst seh' ich nichts!" (Little sister, I see nothing else!) After Märchen-Frau finished ballad alone, conclusion received shouts applause laughter, would considerably astonished good father, could he heard them, sometimes oblige mother call order loft above, propriety's sake; for, truth, good woman loved hear them, often hummed chorus herself she turned clothes among she busy. At last, however, years crowning enjoyment St. Nicholas's Day, credit Märchen-Frau doomed fade. The last reading rather failure, old ballad-book supplanted new one, children outgrown histories; perhaps--though acknowledge it--Friedrich degree blame. His increasing knowledge, long readings bookseller's shop, his brothers sisters neither shared knew of, given feeling contempt one book feasted year year; his part, Märchen-Frau, occasion remarkable yawns anything else. The effect failure confined day. Whenever book brought out, feeling magic gone, greatly poor children disquieted fact. At last, one summer's day, year writing, one boys struck, he fancied, brilliant idea; brilliant ideas subject precious, he lost time summoning council his brothers sisters garden. It half-holiday, soon came trooping round great linden tree--where bees already full possession--and youngest girl, six years old, bore book hugged fast her two arms. The boy opened case--as lawyers say--by describing loss interest book since last Feast St. Nicholas. "This not," he said, "arise want love stories themselves, fact knowing well. Whatever ballad Märchen-Frau chose, every line familiar one seemed folly repeat it. In circumstances evident greatest compliment could pay stories forget them, he plan attaining desirable end. Let deny future pleasure; let put away Märchen-Frau till next St. Nicholas's Day, and, meantime, let his best forget much he possibly could." The speaker ceased, silence bees droned answer, children shouted applause garden rang. But came question, Märchen-Frau put? suggestive brother also idea. He found certain bricks thick old garden wall loose, taken hole quite thing purpose. Let wrap book carefully up, put hole, replace bricks. This his proposal, he sat down. The bees droned above, children shouted below, proposal carried amid general satisfaction. "So it," said suggestor, conclusion. "It finally decided. The Märchen-Frau walled up." And walled she forthwith, without parting embrace her judges, possibly slight latent faith suggestion one party perhaps St. Nicholas would put new inside new stories her next December. "I do not think I like new inside, though," doubted child mentioned, shake her tiny plaits, "or new stories either." As quaint little Fräulein went house she met Friedrich, came bookseller's. "Friedrich," said she, solemn voice, "we walled 'Märchen-Frau.'" "Have you, _Schwesterchen_?" This Friedrich's answer; may safely stated that, one asked his sister told him, he would utterly unable reply. He bookseller's! The summer passed, children kept faithfully resolve. The little sister sometimes sat wall comforted Märchen-Frau inside, promises coming soon; brick touched. There something pathetic children's voluntary renouncement one toy. The father absent mother busy, notice loss; Marie missed made inquiries children, she implored silent, discreetly held her tongue. Winter drew on, time change visible manners one children; he seemed restless uncomfortable, something preyed upon his mind. At last he induced unburden others, discovered he could not forget poems "Märchen-Frau." This grievance. "It seems I purpose," groaned he self-indignation. "The nearer time comes, I try forget, clearer I remember everyone. You know pet Bluebeard; well, I thought I would forget altogether, every word: turn came Märchen-Frau I would take piece. And now, rest, one runs head. It quite I purpose." Involuntarily company--who appeared forgotten little he--struck merry tune-- "Blaubart war ein reicher Mann," etc.[A] "Oh, do not!" groaned victim. "That is goes head along, especially verse-- "Stark war seines Körpers Ban, Feurig waren seine Blicke, Aber ach!--ein Missgeschicke!-- Aber ach! sein Bart war blau."[B] "On Sunday, preacher gave text, I looking him, came strongly head I nearly said loud--'But ah! his beard blue!' To-day schoolmaster asked question Solomon. I could remember nothing 'Ah! his beard blue!' I tried week might; harder I try, better I remember every word. It dreadful." [Footnote A: "Bluebeard rich man."] [Footnote B: "Strong build his body, Fiery his glances, But ah!--disaster!-- But ah! his beard blue."] It dreadful; he somewhat comforted learn memories his brothers sisters perverse his own. Those ballads easily forgotten. They refused give hold minds nourished amused long. One children really distressed, exception Friedrich, had, usual, given half his attention subject hand; sat absently humming account Bluebeard's position character, set forth Gotter's ballad. The others came conclusion one hope left--that St. Nicholas might put new ballads old book--and one made hiding-place, followed feebler pace little Fräulein, ran her lips tightly shut, her hands clenched, her eyes wide open mixture fear expectation. The bricks removed, book unwrapped, alas! everything same, even rough woodcut Bluebeard himself, act sharpening his scimitar. There change, except volume rather worse damp. It thrown murmur disappointment, seized immediately little Fräulein, flung herself upon passion tears embraces. Hers faithful affection; charm Märchen-Frau gone. They humour this, naturally looked one find fault with. Friedrich hand, fell upon reproached his want sympathy vexation. The boy awoke brown study, began defend himself:--"He sorry," he said; "but he could not see use making great fuss old ballads, nothing wonderful." This flat heresy, he indignantly desired say got like them--where even _one_ might found, St. Nicholas could provide them? Friedrich even less respectful idea St. Nicholas, said something which, translated English, would look like word _humbug_. This answer question "where get ballad?" fresh storm came upon his head; whereupon much goaded, mixture vanity vexation spirit, he let fact "he thought he could write one almost good himself." This turned current affairs. The children instinctive belief Friedrich's talents, elders attained. The faith childhood great; saw reason he able he said, forthwith began pet coax unmercifully scolded five minutes before. "Beloved Friedrich; dear little brother! _Do_ write one us. We know thou canst!" "I cannot," said Friedrich. "It nonsense. I joking." "It nonsense; know thou canst! Dear Fritz--just please us!" "Do!" said another. "It yesterday mother saying, 'Friedrich nothing useful!' But thou hast written poem thou wilt done one house--ay, town. And thou hast written one poem thou wilt write more, like Hans Sachs, Twelve Wise Masters thou hast told us often." Friedrich read many verses Cobbler Poet, name Hans Sachs awakened thought his mind. He heard nothing speech one sentence, decided him. _Friedrich nothing useful._ "I see I do," he said, walked hastily away. Down garden, road, away mill, he could stand roaring water talk aloud without heard. "Friedrich nothing useful. Yes, I write ballad." He went home, got together scraps paper, commenced. In half-a-dozen days he began many ballads, tore one all. He beat his brains plots, satisfied none. He fair maiden, cruel father, wicked sister, handsome knight, castle Rhine; plunged love story moonlight meeting, escape horseback, pursuit, capture, despair, suicide, ghostly apparition floated river, wrung her hands castle window. It seems impossible author his heroine take her world, bring her back again; poet content. He come sentiment life, felt rough boyish disgust maundering griefs his hero heroine, who, moreover, unpleasantly like every hero heroine he ever read similar circumstances; one thing another Friedrich determined be, original. He half hopes. With dauntlessness young ambition, he determined his best, best better anything ever done one. Having failed sentimental, he tried write something funny. Surely child's tales Bluebeard, Cinderella, etc., easy enough write. He would make _Kindeslied_--a child's song. But he mistaken; write new nursery ballad hardest task all. Time time he struggled; and, last, one day he written destroyed longer effort usual, he went bed hopeless despair. His disappointment mingled his dreams. He dreamt he bookseller's shop hunting among shelves scraps paper he written. He could find them, he thought, came across Petrarch volumes beautiful binding. He opened one saw--not word fair-looking Italian, but--his ballad he could write, written printed good German character his name title-page. He took his hands went shop, he seemed him, his dream, he become man. He dreamt he came steps, people street gathered round cheered shouted. The women held children look him; he Great Man! He thought he turned back shop went counter. There sat smiling little bookseller natural life, smiled bowed him, Friedrich hundred times seen bow smile bearded men came purchase. "How many sold this?" said Friedrich, his dream. "Forty thousand!" another smile bow. Forty thousand! It seemed world must read it. This Fame. He went shop, shouting market-place, home, his father led offered pipes mug ale, he Burgomaster. He sat down, his mother came in, rose embrace her, and, so, knocked mug. Crash! went floor loud noise, woke up; he found bed, he thrown mug water he put his bedside drink thirsty feverish hours he lay awake. He great man, child. He written ballad, broken mug. "Friedrich nothing useful." He buried his face, wept bitterly. In time, his tears dried, early he lay awake beat his brains. He added nothing his former character breaking piece crockery. Something must done. No funny ballads now. He would write something terrible--miserable; something make people weep he wept. He tragic humour indeed. He would hero go world seek his fortune, come back find his lady-love nunnery; old story. Well, he would turn way, put hero monastery; was not new. Then he would shut up, let meet till one monk nun, would grievous enough reason; oldest all. Friedrich gave love stories spot. It clearly his _forte_. Then he thought he would large family brothers sisters, kill plague. But, besides want incident, idea seem sufficiently sad. Either unreality, better faith, idea death possess gloom young older minds juster sense value human life, are, perhaps, heavily bound chains human interests. No; plague story might pathetic, miserable--not miserable enough rate Friedrich. In truth, he felt last every misfortune he could invent lost depths real sorrow oppressed his life, knowledge came idea his ballad. What fool never thought before! He would write history--the miserable bitter history--of great man born small way life, whose merits raise his low estate deserved glorious fame; toil, strive, struggle, his hopes prayers seemed last fulfilled, reward his labours hand, awake find dream; he nearer Fame ever, he might never reach it. Here enough sorrow tragedy. The ballad written now. The next day. Friedrich plunged bookseller's shop. "Well, now, it?" smiled comfortable little bookseller. "I want paper, please," gasped Friedrich; "a good big bit I may it, and, please, I must go now. I come clean shop end week, I busy to-day." "The condition shop," said little bookseller, grandiloquently, wave his hand, "yields important matters; namely, thy condition, child, best. Thou art white sheet paper, thou art heartily welcome. I silent, ignorant. Thou wouldst writer, art yet philosopher, Friedrich. Thou art fast-set thy philosophic equilibrium. Thou hast knocked three books stool since thou hast come shop. Be calm, child: consider even truly also fast-bound-eternally-immutable-condition everlastingly-varying-circumstance--" But time Friedrich home. How he got next three days he never knew. He stumbled house awkwardness idiot, stupid school nothing his previous good character saved flogging. The day Feast St. Nicholas (which holiday) schoolmaster dismissed severe inquiry, he meant dunce his life? Friedrich went home two sentences ringing his head-- "Do I mean dunce life?" "Friedrich nothing useful." To-night ballad must finished. He contrived sit beyond his usual hour, escaped notice crouching behind large linen chest, wrote wrote till his heart beat his head felt would split pieces. At last, careful mother discovered Friedrich bid her good-night, he brought his hiding-place sent bed. He took light went softly ladder loft, and, his great satisfaction, found others asleep. He said his prayers, got bed, he put light; he put box behind prevent seen, drew his paper wrote. The ballad done, he must make fair copy Märchen-Frau; hard work was, his feverish excited state, write thing finished. He worked resolutely, however, last completed trembling hands, pushed his pillow. Then he sat bed, looked round him. Time passed, still he sat shivering clasping his knees, reason he sat was--because he dared lie down. The work done, overstrained mind, longer occupied, filled ghastly fears fancies. He dare put light, yet faint glimmer made darkness horrible. He dare look behind him, though he knew nothing there. He trembled scratching sound wainscot, though he knew mice. A sudden light window, distant chorus, make his heart beat less wildly nothing alarming two three noisy students going home torches. Then his light took matter hands, first flared suddenness almost made Friedrich jump his skin, left total darkness. He could endure longer, and, scrambling bed, crossed floor warm light came steps ladder room beneath. There hero crouched without daring move, comforted sounds life below. But wearying, yet he dared go back. A neighbour "dropped in," he could see figures passing fro across kitchen. At last his sister passed, light shining her golden plaits, he risked low murmur "Marie! Marie!" She stopped instant, passed on; minutes, she returned, came ladder her finger her lips enjoin silence. He needed caution, instinctively aware one parental duty could obvious another tradesman, would crushing folly Friedrich displaying timely severity. The boy crept back bed, Marie came him. There unheroic moments lives greatest men, though head strong clear, plenty light good company, highly satisfactory proper smile condescension upon female inanity, times unpleasant mercy kind arms pity without asking reason, whose presence one may foolish without shame. And ill, perhaps, us, whose acutely strung minds go every discovery, every doubt, humble comforter (whether woman man) whose face faithful spirit set seal peace--a face steadfastness "as face angel." Such face looked upon Friedrich, fancied horrors fled; he wound his arms round Marie's neck, laid his head, comfortable, sublime. After dozen purposeless kisses, she spoke-- "What it, beloved?" "I--I do not think I get sleep," said poet. Marie abstained commenting remark, Friedrich silent comfortable. So comfortable that, though he despised her opinion matters he asked low whisper--"Marie, dost thou think would best thing world great man? To labour labour it, great man last?" Marie's answer low, quite decided-- "No." "Why not, Marie?" "It nice great, I love see thee great man, Friedrich, well indeed, best thing good. Great men always happy ones, though good also glorious, makes one think words poor heathen Lycaonia--'The gods come us likeness men.' But ever thou art great man, little brother, good great things thy life bring thee peace. Nay, rather, neither thy goodness thy greatness, mercy GOD!" And opinion Marie obstinately fixed, Friedrich argued more. "I think I shall now," said hero last; "I thank thee much, Marie." She kissed anew, bade GOD bless him, wished good-night, went ladder till her golden plaits caught glow warm kitchen, Friedrich lost sight her tall figure fair face, alone more. He better, still he could sleep. Wearied vexed, he lay staring darkness till he heard steps upon ladder, became involuntary witness of--the true St. Nicholas. It mother, basket her hand, Friedrich watched her she approached place shoes laid out, his among them. The children means immaculate way greatly superior families, mother tender-hearted, poor memory sins past, Friedrich saw her fill one shoe another cakes sweetmeats. At last she came his, she stopped. He lifted his head, indefinable fury surged his heart. He tiresome since ballad begun; she going put rods his shoes only? _His_! He could borne anything this. Meanwhile, she fumbling basket; and, last, pulled out--not rod, but--a paper cakes another kind, Friedrich particularly attached, she lined shoes thickly, filled sweetmeats, passed on. "Oh, mother! mother! Far, far kind!" The awkwardness stupidity yesterday, many yesterdays, smote heart, roused ready tears. But he cry long, he happy feeling community his brothers sisters getting deserved; seen St. Nicholas's proceedings diverted his mind gloomy fancies, altogether, comfortable sensation cakes kindness, he fell asleep smiling, slept soundly well. The next day he threw his arms round his mother, said cakes "so nice." "But I do not deserve them," he added. "Thou'lt mend," said she kindly. "And doubt Saint knew thou hadst eaten half dinner week past, brought cakes tempt thee; eat all, child; for, doubtless, plenty come from." "I much obliged whoever think it," said Friedrich. "And plenty are," said good woman Marie afterwards, dishing dinner. "Luise Jansen's shop full them. But, bless boy! he is clever anything. There is playing St. Nicholas him." The day went last, evening came on. The tradesman went see he could meet Burgomaster, children became rabid impatience Friedrich's ballad. He would read himself, Marie pressed service, crowned hood cloak, elected Märchen-Frau. The author sat arm-chair, face white miserable he ordered execution. He formed painful contrast his ruddy brothers sisters; would seem he begun already experience truth Marie's assertion, "great men always happy ones." The ballad put Märchen-Frau's hands, she told Friedrich written it. She gave quick glance it, asked he really invented all. The children repeated fact, pleasant surprising one them, Marie began. The young poet evidently good ear, verses easy musical, metre tolerably correct; hero ballad worked harder harder, got higher higher, children clapped hands, discovered "quite like Friedrich." Why, hero almost height fortune, others gloried his success, foolish author bury his face upon his arms, sob silently bitterly sympathy?--moreover, heavy absorbing grief he hear it, Marie stopped instant went again, know steps come behind his chair, his father Burgomaster room. The Märchen-Frau went on; hero awoke his unreal happiness his real fate, bewailed verse verse heavy weights birth, poverty, circumstance, kept heights fame. The ballad ended. Then voice fell Friedrich's ear, nearly took away his breath. It his father's asking sternly, "What this?" And he knew Marie standing up, strange emotion her face, he heard her say-- "It poem Friedrich written. He written himself. Every word. And he twelve years old!" She pointing him, or, perhaps, Burgomaster might recognized huddled miserable figure genius family. His next voice, he said Friedrich could hardly remember; last sentences he clearly understood. "GOD blessed children, neighbour. My wife, well I, would ashamed genius lost want little money. Give child me. He shall liberal education, great man." "I shall not," said tradesman, "stand way his interests commands. I cannot tell say kindness, Burgomaster. GOD willing, I hope he credit town." "GOD willing, he credit his country," said Burgomaster. The words rang Friedrich's ears again, like changes bells. They danced his eyes he saw book. They written his heart "graven iron pen lead rock ever." "GOD _willing, I hope he credit town._" "GOD _willing, he credit his country._" "_He shall liberal education, a_ GREAT MAN." Friedrich tried stand his feet thank Burgomaster; who, occasion, might tempted suppose idiot, white distorted child's face, struggling tears smiles. He could utter word; mist began come his eyes, Burgomaster's head seemed bob down, his father's, his mother's, Marie's, look pity her face. He tried tell _her_ he great man felt quite happy; but, unfortunately, able burst tears, burst laughing, sharp pain shot his head, he remembered more. * * * * * Friedrich dim consciousness coming round this, put bed; he fell asleep, slept heavily. When he woke Marie sitting his side, dark. The mother gone downstairs, she said, she taken her place. Friedrich lay silent bit; last he said, "I happy, Marie." "I glad, dearest." "Dost thou think father let Burgomaster give good education, Marie?" "Yes, dear, I sure he will." "It kind," said Friedrich, thoughtfully; "for I know he wants business. But I help day. And, Marie, I good man, I rich I give great alms poor." "Thou wilt good man thou art rich one, I trust," said his dogmatic sister. "We accepted have, not. Thou hast great talent, wilt give Lord, whether He make thee rich no. Wilt thou not, dearest?" "What dost thou mean, Marie? Am I never write anything hymns?" "No, no, I mean that," she said. "I ignorant cannot rightly explain thee, little brother. But genius great perilous gift; and, oh, Friedrich! Friedrich! promise this:--that thou wilt never, never write anything faith teaching Saviour, thou wilt never use graces poetry cover hideousness sins work lifetime see justly, fight manfully. Promise this." "Oh, Marie! think I could wicked!" "No! no!" she said, covering kisses. "I know thou wilt good great, shall proud little brother. GOD give thee pen ready writer, grace use His glory!" "I will," he said, "GOD help me! I write beautiful hymns thee, Marie, I dead shall sung churches. They shall like Evening Hymn sing often. Sing now, sister!" Marie cleared her throat, low voice, steadied grew louder sweeter till filled house died away among rafters, sang beautiful hymn begins-- "Herr, Dein Auge geht nicht unter, wenn es bei uns Abend wird;" (Lord! Thine eye go down, evening us.) The boy lay drinking full enjoyment simple vocal music innate German character; he lay, he hummed his accustomed part it, mother work caught song involuntarily, sang her work; Marie's clear voice breaking wooden walls house, heard passer street, struck bass familiar hymn, went his way. Before ended, Friedrich sleeping peacefully more. But Marie sat stove till watchman quaint old street told hour midnight, (with childish custom taught her old schoolmaster long ago) she folded her hands, murmured, "Nisi Dominus urbem custodiat, frustra vigilat custos." (Except Lord keep city, watchman waketh vain.) And she slept also. The snow fell softly roof, walls old church outside, pavement street poet's native town, night passed day came. There little tell, night last night his sorrowful humble childhood, day first day his fame. * * * * * The Duke ---- enlightened generous man, munificent patron Arts Sciences, literary scientific men. He exactly genius, he highly accomplished. He wrote little, played little, drew little; fortune befriend him, natural consequence he published little, composed little, framed his pictures. But better remarkable this, generous spirit he loved admired great things particular directions he little. He bought good pictures he painted bad ones; writers, musicians, artists could say little his performances, every reason talk loudly his liberality. He special admirer talent born obscurity; time writing (many years events related above), favourite "lion" literary clique he gathered round his palace, certain poet--the son small tradesman small town, educated kindness Burgomaster (long dead), made Germany ring his fame; visited Courts Europe, received compliments Royalty, whose plays acted theatres, whose poems stood shelves booksellers, great man--Friedrich! It lovely evening, Duke, leaning arm his favourite, walked terrace. The Duke (as usual) best possible humour. The poet (as uncommon) slightest degree inclined bad one. They reading critique his poems. It praise, true, praise judiciously administered, poet aggrieved. He rather felt (as authors unapt feel) poet could write poems critics created express capabilities understanding him. But good Duke his cheery amiable mood, quite bent upon smoothing his ruffled lion condition. "What impossible creatures geniuses please!" he said. "Tell me, friend, ever been, since first began career, bit homage approbation really pleased you?" "Oh, yes!" said poet, tone sounded like Oh, no! "I do not believe it," said Duke. "Come, now, could you, asked, describe happiest proudest hour life?" A new expression came poet's eyes, lighted his gaunt intellectual face. Some old memories awoke within him, doubtful he saw landscape he gazing. But Duke quick, though kind; he thought Friedrich heard him, repeated question. "Yes," said poet. "Yes, indeed I could." "Well, then, let guess," said Duke, facetiously. (He fancied he bringing his crusty genius capital condition.) "Was great tragedy 'Boadicea' first performed Berlin, theatre rose like one man offer homage, gods sent thunder? I wish ever treated humble efforts much favour. Was then?" "No!" "Was his Imperial Majesty Emperor ---- pleased present gold snuff-box set diamonds, express his opinion historical plays incomparably among finest productions poetic genius?" "His Imperial Majesty," said Friedrich, "is brave soldier; but, a--hem!--an indifferent critic. I take snuff, his Imperial Majesty read poetry. The interview gratifying, occasion. No!" "Was staying Dr. Kranz G----, students made great supper you, escorted carriage ways procession torches?" "Poor boys!" said poet, laughing; "it kind, could ill afford it. But would drunk quite much wine one would taken inside University clock, burnt Principal's wig, me. It unsteady procession brought home, I assure you. The way poked torches other's faces left one student, I heard, less eight duels his hands. And, oh! manner howled pathetic love songs! No! no!" The Duke laughed heartily. "Is various occasions fair ladies Germany testified admiration offerings sympathy handiwork?" "No!" roared poet. "Are quite sure?" said Duke, slyly. "I heard comforters, slippers, bouquets, locks hair, besides dozen warm stockings knit fair hands ----" "Spare me!" groaned Friedrich, mock indignation. "Am I pet preacher, I smothered female absurdities? I hair would stuff sofa, comforters would protect regiment Siberia, slippers, stockings ----. I shall sell them, I shall burn them. I would send back, ladies send nothing Christian names, identify Luise, Gretchen, Catherine, Bettina, beyond powers. No!" When ceased laughing Duke continued his catechism. "Was great poet G---- (your rival) paid handsome compliment verses ----" "No!" interrupted poet. "A thousand times no! The great poet praised verses allude simply cover his depreciation 'Captive Queen,' among best efforts, much his style. How Germany worship his bombastic ---- that is nothing! No." "Was passed accidentally streets Dresden, crowd discovered you, carried hotel shoulders?" The momentary frown passed Friedrich's face, he laughed again. "And men carried twisted leg I could not walk fortnight, say nothing headache I endured bowing populace like Chinese mandarin? No!" "Is triumph enjoyed country Europe?" "No!" "My dear genius, I guess more; what, name Fortune, happy occasion--this life triumph?" "It long story, highness, entertaining one myself." "You injustice," said Duke. "A long story good lost. Sit down, favour me." A patron's wishes neglected; somewhat unwillingly poet last sat down, told story his Ballad St. Nicholas's Day, told here. The fountain tears drier middle age childhood, he unmoved he concluded. "Every circumstance evening," he said, "is fresh remembrance then, till I die. It joy, triumph, satisfaction never fade. The words roused despair, promised knowledge ignorance fame humble condition, power make heart beat, bring hopeful tears eyes dried age-- "GOD _willing, he credit town._" "GOD _willing, he credit his country._" "_He shall liberal education, great man._" "It good poem," said delighted Duke. "I shall tell company to-night I fortunate man Germany. I heard unpublished poem. By bye, Poet, ballad published?" "No, never be. It shall never know less kindly criticism received then." "And really earnest? Was indeed happiest triumph talents ever earned?" "It was," said Friedrich. "The first blast trumpet Fame sweetest. Afterwards, find tune." "Your parents dead, I think?" "They are, youngest sister." "And Marie?" "She married--a man who, I think, way worthy her. Not bad, stupid man, strong Bible convictions subject marital authority. She angel his house he never understand world." "Do ever see her?" "Sometimes, I want rest. I went see her long ago, found her ever. I sat her feet, laid head her lap, tried child again. I bade her tell history Bluebeard, strove forget I ever lost childish simplicity she kept well;--and I almost succeeded. I forgotten great poet jealous 'Captive Queen,' told would grand thing like him. I thought I like see live Emperor. But delusion perfect, row street. The people found out, I must show window. The spell broken. I tried again." They steps palace. "Your story entertained touched beyond measure," said Duke. "But something wanting. It (as say) 'end well.' I fear happy." "I content," said Friedrich. "Yes, I happy. I never could child again, even pleased GOD restore circumstances childhood. It best is, I learnt truth Marie told me. It good, great things life bring peace; rather, neither one other, undeserved mercies GOD!" * * * * * For desire know poet's life told, added. He live old. A painful disease (the result mental toil), borne many years, ended his life almost prime. He retained his faculties till last, bore protracted suffering heroism endurance he always displayed smaller trials. The medical men pronounced, authority _post-mortem_ examination, he must years suffered silent martyrdom. Truly, his bodily sufferings (when known last) might well excuse many weaknesses much moody, irritable impatience; especially remembered mental sufferings intellectual men generally great proportion gifts, (when clogged nerves body ever urged beyond strength) often mock pride humanity leaving little space genius madman. Another fact known till he died--his charity. Then discovered much kindness he exercised secret, three poor widows fed daily his table best years his prosperity. Before his death he arranged his affairs, even disposal his worn-out body. "My country gracious me," he said, "and, cares, may dispose carcase will. But I desire death heart may taken body buried feet father mother churchyard native town. At feet," he added, old imperiousness--"strong death." "At feet, remember!" In one largest cities Germany, huge marble monument erected memory Great Man. On three sides pedestal bas-relief designs illustrating his works, whereby three fellow-countrymen added fame; fourth fine inscription Latin, setting forth his talents, his virtues, honours conferred him, stating conclusion (on authority his eulogizer) his works gained immortality. In quiet green churchyard, near quiet little town, shadow quaint old church, little cross marks graves tradesman his wife lived laboured generation, rest. Near them, daisies grow dust "Fräulein," awaits resurrection dead. And feet simple couple lies heart great son--a heart sickness earthly hope fever earthly ambition shall disturb more. By Poet's desire, "the rude memorial" marks spot contains his initials, words his native tongue mark foundation ambition he could feel death-- "Ich verlasse mich auf Gottes Güte immer und ewiglich." --_My trust tender mercy of_ GOD _for ever ever._ A BIT OF GREEN. "Thou oughtest, therefore, call mind heavy sufferings others, thou mayest easier bear thy small troubles."--THE IMITATION OF CHRIST. Children live always grass flowers feet, clear sky overhead, real idea charm country sights sounds whose home dirty, busy, manufacturing town--just town, fact, I lived I boy, twenty years ago. My father doctor, large, called "genteel," practice, lived comfortable house broad street. I born bred there; and, ever since I could remember, last sound soothed ears night, first I awoke morning, eternal rumbling rattling carts carriages passed rough stones. I never noticed I heard day-time, night chief amusement, I lay bed, guess sound wheels sort vehicle passing. "That light sharp rattle cab," I thought. "What noise makes, gone moment! One gentleman inside, I think. There is omnibus; there, jolty-jolt, goes light cart; that is carriage, way horses step; now, rumbling heavily distance, coming slowly nearer, heavier, louder, nothing brewer's dray!" And dray came slowly I asleep got safely hearing. Ours noisy street, noise made night cheerful; church clock near, struck quarters; light street lamps, came blind fell upon little bed. We little light, except gaslight daylight, street; sunshine seldom found way us, and, did, people little used pulled blinds fear hurt carpets. In room sister I called nursery, however, always welcomed blinds rolled top; and, carpet, damage done. But sunshine outside always make sunshine shine within, I remember one day when, though nursery unusually cheerful, though windows reflected square patches sunlight floor, I stood midst brightness, grumbling kicking sister's chair face black thunder-cloud. The reason ill-temper this: Ever since I could remember, father accustomed, year, take us country change air. Once he taken us sea, generally went old farmhouse middle beautiful moors lay many miles dirty black town. But year, sunshiny morning, he announced breakfast he could let us go called moor-home. He even added insult injury expressing his thankfulness good health, change matter necessity. I indignant speak, rushed upstairs nursery, little sister also taken refuge. She always gentle obedient (provokingly so, I thought), she sat rocking her doll her knee silent sorrow, whilst I stood kicking her chair grumbling tone well doll could hear, rocking would little use. I took pleasure trying make her angry myself. I reminded her lovely purple moors looking moment, sweet heather smelt, good bilberries tasted. I said I thought "very hard." It was not always paying visits, many children did, country relations; one treat year, father wanted take away. Not soul town, I said, would unfortunate were. The children next door would go somewhere, course. So would little Smiths, Browns, _everybody_. Everybody else went sea autumn; contented moors, he would not even let us go there. And, end every burst complaint, I discharged volley kicks leg chair, wound "I cannot think he cannot!" "I do not know," said sister, timidly, "but he said something affording it, spending money, trade bad, he afraid would great distress town." Oh, illogical women! I furious. "What earth us?" I shouted her. "Father's doctor; trade will not hurt him. But silly, Minnie, I cannot talk you. I know it is hard. Fancy staying whole year boxed beastly town!" And I worked I fully believed truth sentence I concluded-- "_There never_ WAS _anything miserable!_" Minnie said nothing, feelings something like dogs (Dr. Watts tells us) "delight To bark bite;" perhaps she afraid bitten. At rate, she held her tongue; father came room. The door open, he must heard last speech he came along passage; he made remark it, said, "Would young man like go see patient?" I went willingly, I tired half-ashamed teasing Minnie, soon street. It broad cheerful one, I said; long left narrower, turned side street, foot-path would allow us walk single file--a dirty, dark lane, surely sun never shine. "What horrid place!" I said. "I never before. Why do not pull street down?" "What become people live it?" said father. "Let live one bigger streets," I said; "it would much comfortable." "Very likely," he said; "but would pay much houses; have not money pay with, what is done?" I could say, for, like older social reformers myself, I felt sure reform needed, accomplish it. But I could decide upon dirty little street, come place much worse put quite head. There mournful fatality pretty names given, mockery, wretched bye-streets large towns. The street left called Rosemary Street, Primrose Place. Primrose Place like yard street; houses irregular different ages. On one side gap palings round it, building going on, beyond rose huge black factory. But condition Primrose Place beyond description. I never seen anything like before, kept close father consistent boyish, dignity. The pathway broken up, children squalled doors quarrelled street, strewn rags, bones, bits old iron, shoes, tops turnips. I think whole unbroken window row tall miserable houses, wet clothes hanging lines stretched across street, flapped heads. I counted three cripples went Primrose Place. My father stopped speak several people, I heard many complaints bad state trade sister alluded. He gave money one woman, spoke kindly all; he hurried fast he could, turned last one houses. My ill-humour time almost worked fresh air, novel scenes come; and, present, morning's disappointment forgotten I followed father crowded miserable rooms, clambered staircase staircase, till reached top house, stumbled latched door garret. After much groping dark, light dazzled me, I thought first room empty. But last faint "Good day" corner near window drew eyes way; there, stretched sort bed, supported chair his back, lay patient come see. He young man twenty-six years old, last stage terrible disease fatally common country--he dying consumption. There mistaking flushed cheek, painfully laborious breathing, incessant cough; two old crutches corner spoke another affliction--he cripple. His gaunt face lighted glow pleasure father came in, seated end bed, began talk him, whilst I looked round room. There absolutely nothing it, except bed sick man lay, chair supported him, small three-legged table. The low roof terribly repair, window patched newspaper; glass panes left, full glory streamed sun, midst blaze stood pot musk full bloom. The soft yellow flowers looked grand, smelled sweet, I lost admiration, till I found sick man's black eyes fixed mine. "You looking bit green, master?" he said, gratified tone. "Do like flowers?" I inquired, coming shyly bed. "Do I like  them?" he exclaimed low voice. "Ay, I love  them well enough--well enough," he looked fondly plant, "though it is long since I saw these." "You country long time?" I inquired, compassionately. I felt sad think he perhaps lain months, without taste fresh air run fields; I _not_ prepared his answer. "_I never country, young gentleman._" I looked father. "Yes," he said, answer glance, "it quite true. William born here. He got hurt boy, lame ever since. For years he entirely confined house. He never town, never saw green field." Never town! confined house years! house! The tears rushed eyes, I felt angry heart-ache sight suffering produces young insensible it, ignorant GOD's Providence submit "quietness confidence" His will. "My son hardly believe it, William." "It shame," I said; "it horrible. I sorry you." The black eyes turned kindly upon me, sick man said, "Thank heartily, Sir. You mean kindly. I used say sort things myself, I younger, knew better. I used think hard, one miserable I was. But I know much better I folks, many things I thankful for." I looked round room, began involuntarily count furniture--one, two, three. The "many things" certainly chairs tables. But he gazing him, went on: "I often think thankful I ought die peace, quiet room myself. There girl consumption floor me; she used sit cough, her father mother quarrelled I could hear floor. I used send her half anything nice I had, I found took it. I wish then," he added, sudden flush, "that I strong man!" "How shocking!" I said. "Yes," he answered; "it first set thinking many mercies I had. And came good parson St. John's, he taught many things; I knew father; neighbours kind. And I could work I got good wage, laid bit; I have sold things, there will sell I am gone; I have got keep I live, pay coffin. What man want more?" What, indeed! Unsatisfied heart, make answer! A fit coughing shook crazy room interrupted here. When he recovered himself, he turned father. "Ay, ay, I many mercies, know, Sir. Who would thought I could kept bit green like plant mine place like this? But, see, pulled old houses opposite I got it, sun could not come king's room better comes mine. I always afraid, year year, would build up, bit green would die; building now, last time. Indeed, indeed, I have much thankful for. Not," he added, low, reverential tone, "not mention greater blessings. The presence LORD! presence LORD!" I awed, almost frightened, tone he spoke, look his face, shadow death falling fast. He lay sort stupor, gazing his black eyes broken roof, he saw something invisible us. It time he seemed recollect there, I ventured ask him. "Where get plant?" He smiled. "That is long story, master; way. You see, father died quite young decline, left mother struggle eight us she could. She buried six, one another; she died herself, brother Ben I left alone. But mighty fond one another, got well. I got plenty employment, weaving mats baskets shop town, Ben worked factory. One Saturday night he came home state, said going cheap trip Monday country. It first parts, though many since, I believe. Neither he I ever town, he full must go. He brought his Saturday wage him, would work hard afterwards. Well, see, landlord day, said he must rent Tuesday, he would turn us out. I would got laid by, looking Ben's wages make up. But I could not bear see his face pining bit fresh air, I thought I could stay home work Monday would make rent, he need never know. So I pretended I did not want go, could not bothered fuss; last I set Monday without me. It late night he came back like one wild. He would got flowers his hat, flowers his button-holes; he would got his handkerchief filled hay, carrying something his coat. He began laughing crying, 'Eh, Bill!' he said, 'thou hast fool. Thou hast missed summat. But I have brought thee bit green, lad, I have brought thee bit green.' And he lifted his coat, plant, woman given him. We did not sleep much night. He spread hay bed, lay face on, see fields smelt, he began told it; that, I tired work, Sunday afternoon, I used say, 'Now, Ben, tell us bit country.' And he liked nothing better. He used say I go, he carried his back; LORD see fit. He took cold work, went three months afterwards. It singular, morning he died he called him, said, 'Bill, I have dreaming trip thou didst want go all. I dreamt--' he stopped, said more; but, bit, he opened his eyes wide, pulled him, he said, 'Bill, lad, there is flowers heaven, flowers!' And LORD took him. But I kept bit green his sake." Here followed another fit coughing, brought father end bed forbid his talking more. "I got see another patient yard," he said, "and I leave son here. He shall read chapter two till I come back; he good reader his age." And father went. I was, he said, good reader age; I felt nervous sick man drew Bible his side, put hands. I wondered I read; soon settled his asking certain Psalms, I read clearly distinctly I could. At first I rather disturbed his occasional remarks, murmured Amens; I soon got used it. He joined devoutly "Glory Father"--with I concluded--and asked chapter Revelation St. John. I ease now, read best, happy sense useful; whilst he lay sunshine, folding sheet his bony fingers, his eyes fixed beloved "bit green," drinking Words Life dying ears. "_Blessed dwell heavenly Jerusalem, need sun, neither moon, shine it; glory of_ GOD _does lighten it, Lamb light thereof._" By time father returned, sick man I fast friends; I left his blessing head. As went home, good kind father told I nearly old enough take interest his concerns, began talk his patients, poverty destitution parts town. Then he spoke bad state trade--that expected worse, want work consequent misery year would probably great. Finally he added, many likely starving, he thought right deny little annual treat, save money enable us take part relieving distressed. "Do not think so, boy?" he concluded, reached door comfortable (how comfortable!) home. My whole heart "Yes." It happy moment son his father first confides him. It happy moment father his son first learns appreciate labour his life, henceforth obey his commands, blind obedience, sympathizing spirit "perfect love" "casts fear." My heart full thank his wise forbearance wiser confidence; months sister's health made change air house country relative necessary, great pride thankfulness I well enough remain post duty father's side. One day, long visit William, he went see him; he came back I saw musk-plant his hand news he brought. Its flowers lovelier ever, master transplanted heavenly garden, he left me. Mortal man learn virtue one lesson; I often life ungrateful GOD man.

In one beautiful corners beautiful France stood grand old château. It fine old building, countless windows large small, high-pitched roofs pointed towers, good taste bad, best everywhere ornamental, gorgon heads frowned turrets long row stables fantastic dovecotes. It stood (as became castle) upon eminence, looked down. Very beautiful indeed looked upon. Terrace terrace glowed brilliant flowers, broad flights steps led one garden other. On last terrace all, fountains jets water poured one large basin, gold silver fish. Beyond shady walks, led lake floated water-lilies swans. From top topmost flight steps could see blazing gardens one other, fountains basin, walks lake, beyond trees, smiling country, blue sky France. Within castle, without, beauty reigned supreme. The sunlight, subdued blinds curtains, stole rooms furnished every grace luxury could procured country accounted highly-civilized world. It fell upon beautiful flowers beautiful china, upon beautiful tapestry pictures; fell upon Madame Viscountess, sitting her embroidery. Madame Viscountess young, she least beautiful object stately rooms. She married race nobles (themselves famed personal beauty) scrupulous choice lovely wives. The late Viscount (for Madame widow) one handsomest gay courtiers his day; Madame unworthy him. Even now, though roses her cheeks entirely artificial days her youth, she like exquisite piece porcelain. Standing embroidery frame Madame's child, boy who, spite his youth, already Monsieur Viscount. He also beautiful. His exquisitely-cut mouth curl inheritance scornful generations, redeemed his soft violet eyes under-lying expression natural amiability. His hair cut square across forehead, fell natural curls behind. His childish figure already trained fencing school, gathered dignity perpetually treading upon shallow steps lofty rooms. From rosettes his little shoes his _chapeau à plumes_, he also like porcelain figure. Surely, beings could exist except château this, air (unlike breathed common mortals) ante-rooms faint aristocratic odour, yards round Madame Viscountess dimly suggestive frangipani! Monsieur Viscount stay long embroidery frame; he entertaining to-day party children estate, come key old cabinet he wished display treasures. When tired this, went terrace, one children exclaimed beauty view. "It true," said little Viscount, carelessly, "and all, far see, estate." "I throw stone end property, Monsieur," said one boys, laughing; he picked one walk, stepping back, flung his little strength. The stone fell passed fountains, failure received shouts laughter. "Let us see beat that," cried; general search pebbles, flung random among flower beds. "One may easily throw those," said Viscount, poking wall first terrace; "but stone one may call stone. Who send fish-pond? It make fountain itself." The children drew round as, ruffles turned back, he tugged pulled large dirty looking stone, half-buried earth wall. "Up comes!" said Viscount, length; sure enough, came; underneath it, his bright eyes shining his dirty wrinkled body--horror horrors!--there lay toad. Now, even England, toads looked upon much favour, party English children would startled discovery. But French people, dread toads ludicrous intensity. In France toads believed teeth, bite, spit poison; hero his young guests must excused taking flight cry dismay. On next terrace, however, paused, seeing signs enemy, crept slowly back again. The little Viscount (be said) began feel ashamed himself, led way, his hand upon miniature sword hung his side. All eyes fixed upon fatal stone, behind seen slowly push forth, first dirty wrinkled leg, half dirty wrinkled head, one gleaming eye. It much; cries of, "It he! he comes! he spits! he pursues us!" young guests château fled good earnest, never stopped reached fountain fish-pond. But Monsieur Viscount stood his ground. At sudden apparition blood rushed his heart, made white, flooded back made red, he fairly drew his sword, shouting, "_Vive la France!_" rushed upon enemy. The sword small sharp, stabbed poor toad would undoubtedly been, sudden check received valiant little nobleman. It came shape large heavy hand seized Monsieur Viscount grasp giant, voice could belonged owner hand said slow deep tones, "_Que faites-vous?_" ("What doing?") It tutor, pacing terrace book, stood holding book his right hand, hero his left. Monsieur Viscount's tutor remarkable man. If he so, he would hardly tolerated château, since he particularly beautiful, especially refined. He holy orders, his tonsured head clerical costume bore witness--a costume which, tightness simplicity, served exaggerate unusual proportions his person. Monsieur Preceptor English blood his veins, his northern origin betrayed his towering height corresponding breadth, well his fair hair light blue eyes. But remarkable parts his outward man his hands, immense size, especially thumbs. Monsieur Preceptor exactly keeping his present abode. It he wanting grace beauty reigned around him, his presence made graces beauties look small. He seemed gift reverse bestowed upon King Midas--the gold his heavy hand laid seemed become rubbish. In presence late Viscount, Madame his widow, would felt fully deep importance dress _à la mode_, complexion _à la_ strawberries cream (such influences still exist); let burly tutor appear upon scene, magic died brocaded silks pearl-coloured stockings, dress complexion became subjects almost insignificance. Monsieur Preceptor certainly singular man chosen inmate household; but, though young, he unusual talents, added usual accompaniments modesty trustworthiness. To crown all, he rigidly pious times piety fashionable, obedient son church he minister. Moreover, family fashion permit demonstratively religious, may gain reflected credit austere chaplain; Monsieur Preceptor remained château went his way. It man laid hands Viscount, and, voice sounded like amiable thunder, made inquiry, "_Que faites-vous?_" "I going kill animal--this hideous horrible animal," said Monsieur Viscount, struggling vainly grasp tutors finger thumb. "It toad," said Monsieur Preceptor, his laconic tones. "_Only_ toad, say, Monsieur?" said Viscount. "That enough, I think. It bite--it spit--it poison: like dragon tell of, devastated Rhodes--I good knight shall kill it." Monsieur Preceptor laughed heartily. "You misled vulgar error. Toads bite--they teeth; neither spit poison." "You wrong, Monsieur," said Viscount; "I seen teeth myself. Claude Mignon, lodge, two terrible ones, he keeps his pocket charm." "I seen them," said tutor, "in Monsieur Claude's pocket. When he show similar ones toad's head I believe. Meanwhile, I must beg you, Monsieur, put sword. You must kill poor animal, quite harmless, useful garden--it feeds upon many insects reptiles injure plants." "It shall useful, garden," said little Viscount, fretfully. "There plenty gardeners destroy insects, and, needful, more. But toad shall remain. My mother would faint she saw hideous beast among her beautiful flowers." "Jacques!" roared tutor gardener distance. Jacques started clap thunder sounded his ear, approached low bows. "Take toad, Jacques, carry _potager_. It keep slugs cabbages." Jacques bowed low lower, scratched his head, reverence Asiatic humility, time moved gradually backwards, never even looked toad. "You also seen contents Monsieur Claude's pocket?" said tutor, significantly, quitting his hold Viscount, he stooped down, seized toad his huge finger thumb, strode direction _potager_, followed respectful distance Jacques, vented his awe astonishment alternate bows exclamations astounding conduct incomprehensible Preceptor. "What use ugly beasts?" said Viscount his tutor, his return _potager_. "Birds butterflies pretty, villains toads made for?" "You study natural history, Monsieur--" began priest, naturalist. "That always say," interrupted Viscount, perverse folly ignorance; "but I knew much do, would make understand ugly creatures need made." "Nor," said priest, firmly, "is necessary understand it, particularly care inquire. It enough remember Who made them, six thousand years either us born." With Monsieur Preceptor (who time kept his place little book his big thumb) returned terrace, resumed his devotions point interrupted exercise he continued till he joined Curé village, two priests relaxed political religious gossip day. Monsieur Viscount rejoined his young guests, fed gold fish swans, played _Colin Maillard_ shady walks, made beautiful bouquet Madame, fled indoors first approach evening chill, found Viscountess prepared feast fruit flowers great hall. Here, head table, Madame his right hand, his guests around, liveried lacqueys waiting his commands, Monsieur Viscount forgot anything ever made could mar beauty enjoyment; two priests outside stalked falling twilight, talked ugly talk crime poverty _somewhere_ now, troubles come hereafter. And night fell beautiful sky, beautiful château, beautiful gardens; upon secure slumbers beautiful Madame her beautiful son, beautiful, beautiful France. * * * * * CHAPTER II. It year grace 1792, thirteen years events related last chapter. It 2nd September, Sunday, day rest peace Christian countries, even gay, beautiful France--a day festivity merriment. This Sunday, however, seemed rather exception general rule. There gay groups bannered processions; typical incense public devotion symbol alike wanting; streets places seemed deserted, others ominous crowd, dreary silence broken distant sound yells cries, struck terror hearts Parisians. It deserted bye-street, overlooked shut-up warehouses, cellar one young man crept pathway. His dress beautiful, torn soiled; his face beautiful still, marred hideous eagerness face famine laid her hand--he starving. As man came warehouse, another man came street. His dress beautiful, neither he. There red look him--he wore red flannel cap, tricolour ribbons, something red upon his hands, neither ribbon flannel. He also looked hungry; food. The stopped he saw him, pulled something his pocket. It watch, repeater, gold filigree case exquisite workmanship, raised figures depicting loves Arcadian shepherd shepherdess; and, lay white hand owner, bore evanescent fragrance seemed recall scenes beautiful completely past days pastoral perfection, "All world love young And truth every shepherd's tongue." The young man held spoke. "It mother's," he said, appealing glance violet eyes; "I would part I starving. Will get food?" "You hiding?" said he red cap. "Is crime days?" said other, smile would days irresistible. The man took watch, shaded donor's beautiful face rough red cap tricolour ribbon, bade follow him. He, lately come Paris, dragged his exhausted body his conductor, hardly noticed crowds streets, signs man got free passage both, entrance little side-door large dark building, never knew till he delivered one gaolers he led prison Abbaye. Then wretch tore cap Liberty his victim's head, pointed fierce laugh. "He wants food, aristocrat. He shall wait long--there feast court below, he shall join presently. See it, Antoine! And you, _Monsieur_, _Mons-ieur_! listen banqueters." He ceased, silence yells cries court came like horrid answer imprecation. The man continued-- "He paid his admission, Monsieur. It belonged Madame his mother. Behold!" He held watch his head, dashed insane fury ground, and, bidding gaoler see his prisoner, rushed away court below. The prisoner needed attention. Weakness, fasting, horror overpowered delicate body sensitive mind, he lay senseless shattered relic happier times. Antoine, gaoler (a weak-minded man circumstances made cruel), looked indifference Jacobin remained place, half-suppressed pity he gone. The place he lay hall passage prison, several cells opened, number prisoners gathered together one end it. One watched proceedings Jacobin his victim profound interest, advanced poor youth lay. He priest, though thirteen years passed his head since saw château, though toil suffering anxiety added traces many more, yet would difficult recognize towering height, candid face, and, finally, large thumb little book ----, Monsieur Preceptor, years ago exchanged his old position parochial cure. He strode gaoler (whose head came little priest's elbow), and, drawing aside, asked, his old abruptness, "Who this?" "It Vicomte de B----. I know his face. He escaped commissaires days." "I thought so. Is his name registers?" "No. He escaped arrest, brought in, saw." "Antoine," said priest, low voice, gaze seemed pierce soul weak little gaoler; "Antoine, shoemaker Rue de la Croix, two three hard winters I think found friend." "Oh! Monsieur le Curé," said Antoine, writhing; "if Monsieur le Curé would believe I could save his life! But--" "Pshaw!" said priest, "it myself, boy. You must save him, Antoine. Hear me, _must_. Take one lower cells hide him. You risk nothing. His name prison register. He called, he missed; fanatic think he perished rest us (Antoine shuddered, though priest move muscle) mad fever subsided order restored, he reward you. And Antoine--" Here priest pocketed his book, somewhat awkwardly his huge hands unfastened left side his cassock, tore silk lining. Monsieur le Curé's cassock seemed cabinet oddities. First he pulled ingenious hiding-place crucifix, he replaced; knot white ribbon, he also restored; and, finally, tiny pocket bag cream-coloured satin, embroidered small bunches heartsease, aromatic otto roses. Awkwardly, somewhat slowly, he drew small locket, centre unreadable legend cabalistic-looking character, blazed finest diamonds. Heaven alone knows secret gem, struggle priest yielded it. He put Antoine's hand, talking he partly partly gaoler. "We brought nothing world, certain carry nothing out. The diamonds finest, Antoine, sell much. The blessing dying priest upon kindly, his curse ill poor child, whose home home better days. And locket--it remembrance, remember difficult!" As last observation addressed Antoine, also he hear it. He discontentedly watching body Viscount, he consented help, genuine weak-mindedness consented ungraciously. "How I get there? Monsieur le Curé sees he cannot stand upon his feet." Monsieur le Curé smiled, stooping, picked his old pupil his arms he baby, bore one doors. "You must come further," said Antoine, hastily. "Ingrate!" muttered priest momentary anger, then, ashamed, he crossed himself, pressing young nobleman his bosom last gush earthly affection he feel, he kissed his senseless face, spoke benediction ears could hear it, laid his burden down. "GOD Father, Son, Holy Ghost, thee dread hour death. Adieu! shall meet hereafter." The look pity, yearning rekindled love, struggle silenced memories passed his face left shining calm--foretaste perpetual Light eternal Rest. Before he reached prisoners, large thumb found old place little book, lips formed old old words; might almost said already, "his spirit GOD gave it." As Monsieur Viscount, perhaps well he sensible his position, Antoine got flight stone steps led cell simple process dragging heels. After similar fashion he crossed floor, deposited pallet; gaoler emptied broken pitcher water his face, locking door securely, hurried back his charge. When Monsieur Viscount came his senses he raised looked round his new abode. It small stone cell; underground, little grated window top seemed level court; pallet--painfully pressed worn--a chair, stone stood plate broken pitcher, one corner huge bundle firewood mocked place fire. Stones lay scattered about, walls black, far dark corners wet oozed trickled slowly down, lizards reptiles crawled up. I suppose first object attracts hopes new prisoner window his cell, this, despite his weakness, Monsieur Viscount crept. It afforded little satisfaction. It high cell reach it, low prison command view, securely grated iron. Then he examined walls, stone loose. As he so, his eye fell upon floor, he noticed two stones lay raised one third laid upon top. It looked like child's play, Monsieur Viscount kicked down, he saw underneath pellet paper roughly rolled together. Evidently something left former occupant cell his successor. Perhaps he begun plan getting away he time perfect his account, Perhaps--but time paper spread out, Monsieur Viscount read writing. The paper old yellow. It fly-leaf torn little book, written black chalk, words-- "_Souvenez-vous du Sauveur._" (Remember Saviour.) He turned over, he turned back again; mark; nothing more; Monsieur Viscount conceal he disappointed. How could otherwise? He bred ease luxury, surrounded everything could make life beautiful; ugliness, want, sickness, make life miserable, kept, far kept, precincts beautiful château his home. What _consolations_ religion him? They offered (and only) need them. They Monsieur Viscount Crucified Christ Greeks old--foolishness. He put paper his pocket lay again, feeling crowning disappointment he lately suffered. Presently, Antoine came food; dainty, Monsieur Viscount devoured like famished hound, made inquiries he came long he there. When gaoler began describe him, he called Curé, Monsieur Viscount's attention quickened eagerness, eagerness deepened tender interest always hangs round names known happier younger days. The happy memories recalled hearing his old tutor seemed blot his present misfortunes. With French excitability, he laughed wept alternately. "As burly ever, say? The little book? I remember it, his breviary. Ah! he. It Monsieur Preceptor, I seen years. Take him, bring here, let see him!" But Monsieur Preceptor Paradise. That first night Monsieur Viscount's imprisonment terrible one. The bitter chill Parisian autumn, gnawings half-satisfied hunger, thick walls shut hope escape exclude fearful cries lasted intervals throughout night, made like hideous dream. At last morning broke; half-past two of the clock, members _commune_ presented hall National Assembly significant announcement:--"The prisons empty!" Antoine, quaking hours, took courage, went half loaf bread pitcher water cell "empty." He found his prisoner struggling knot white ribbon, he trying fasten his hair. One glance his face told all. "It fever," said Antoine; he put bread water fetched old blanket pillow; day many days, gaoler hung his prisoner's pallet tenderness woman. Was he haunted vision burly figure bent his sick bed Rue de la Croix? Did voice (once familiar counsel benediction!) echo still his ears? "_The blessing dying priest upon well, his curse ill poor child, whose home home better days._" Be may, Antoine tended his patient constancy compatible keeping his presence prison secret; till crisis safely past, he began visit cell less frequently, reassumed harsh manners he held befit his office. Monsieur Viscount's mind rambled much his illness. He called his mother, long dead. He fancied his château. He thought his servants stood body him, one would move wait him. He thought he abundance tempting food cooling drinks, placed beyond his reach. He thought he saw two lights like stars near together, close ground, kept appearing vanishing away. In time he became sensible; château melted stern reality his prison walls; delicate food became bread water; servants disappeared like spectres; empty cell, dark corners near floor, he still fancied he saw two sparks light coming going, appearing vanishing away. He watched till his giddy head would bear longer, he closed his eyes slept. When he awoke he much better, he raised turned towards stone--there, bread broken pitcher, sat dirty, ugly, wrinkled toad, gazing him, Monsieur Viscount, eyes yellow fire. Monsieur Viscount long ago forgotten toad alarmed his childhood; his national dislike animal lessened years, toad prison seemed likely fare better toad château. He dragged his pallet, took one large damp stones lay floor cell, throw intruder. He expected he approached it, toad would crawl away, he could throw stone it; his surprise, beast sat quite unmoved, looking calm shining eyes, and, somehow other, Monsieur Viscount lacked strength heart kill it. He stood doubtful moment, sudden feeling weakness obliged drop stone, sit down, tears sprang his eyes sense his helplessness. "Why I kill it?" he said, bitterly. "The beast live grow fat upon damp loathsomeness, long put end feeble life. It shall remain. The cell big, big enough us both. However large rooms man builds live in, needs little space die!" So Monsieur Viscount dragged his pallet away toad, placed another stone it, removed pitcher; then, wearied his efforts, lay slept heavily. When he awoke, new stone pitcher toad, staring full topaz eyes. He lay still time move, animal showed intention spitting, he puzzled tameness. "It seems like sight man," he thought. "Is possible former inmate wretched prison amused his solitude making pet creature? man, he now?" Henceforward, sleeping waking, whenever Monsieur Viscount lay upon his pallet, toad crawled stone, kept watch shining lustrous eyes; whenever sound key grating lock, gaoler coming his rounds, away crept toad, quickly lost dark corners room. When man gone, returned place, Monsieur Viscount would talk it, he lay his pallet. "Ah! Monsieur Crapaud," he would say, mournful pleasantry, "without doubt master kind one; but, tell me, he, he now? Was he old young, last stage maddening loneliness he made friends creature you?" Monsieur Crapaud looked intelligent, he made reply, Monsieur Viscount recourse Antoine. "Who cell me?" he asked gaoler's next visit. Antoine's face clouded. "Monsieur le Curé room. My orders he imprisoned secret.'" Monsieur le Curé room. There revelation words. It explained now. The priest always love animals (and ugly, common animals), his pupil means shared. His room château little less menagerie. He even kept glass beehive there, communicated hole window bees flew out, he would stand hours his thumb breviary, watching labours his pets. And also his room! This dark, damp cell. Here, breviary hand, he stood, lain, knelt. Here, miserable prison, he found something love, expend rare intelligence benevolence his nature. Here, finally, last hours his life, he written fly-leaf his prayer-book something comfort his successor, and, "being dead, yet spoke" words consolation he administered his lifetime. Monsieur Viscount read paper different feelings. There is, perhaps, argument strong, virtue commands respect young men, consistency. Monsieur Preceptor's lifelong counsel example would done less his pupil effected knowledge his consistent career, past. It nobility priest's principles awoke Monsieur Viscount desire imitate his religious example, fact he applied his life, time wealth, time tribulation hour death. All high-strung piety--that life prayer--those unswerving admonitions consider vanity earthly treasures, prepare death--which sounded unreal amidst perfumed elegances château, came back reality gained experiment. The daily life self-denial, conversation garnished Scripture Fathers, not, all, mere priestly affectations. In symbolic manner, literally, he "watched coming his Lord," "taken cross daily;" so, cross laid him, voice spoke must speak all, "The Master come, calleth thee," he bore burden obeyed summons unmoved. _Unmoved_!--this fact struck deep heart Monsieur Viscount, he listened Antoine's account Curé's imprisonment. What astonished overpowered his undisciplined nature disturbed Monsieur Preceptor. He prayed château--he prayed prison. He often spoken château softening comforting influences communion lower animals nature, uncertainty imprisonment he tamed toad. "None things moved him," and, storm grief admiration, Monsieur Viscount bewailed memory his tutor. "If he lived teach me!" But he dead, nothing Monsieur Viscount make his example. This easy follow he imagined. Things seemed different Monsieur Preceptor. He lofty meditations, ardent prayers, calm peace seemed distant ever. Monsieur Viscount met, short, difficulties soul must meet with, which, moment enthusiasm, resolved upon higher better way life, moments depression perpetually tempted forego resolution. His prison life was, however, pretty severe discipline, he held struggles prayers; so, little little, day day, time his imprisonment went by, consolations religion became daily strength fretfulness imperious temper, sickness hope deferred, dark suggestions despair. The term his imprisonment long one. Many prisoners came went within walls Abbaye, Monsieur Viscount still remained his cell; indeed, he would gained little leaving he could done so, he would almost certainly retaken. As was, Antoine one occasion concealed behind bundles firewood, twice he narrowly escaped detection less friendly officials. There times guillotine seemed almost better long suspense: heads passed block, his remained his shoulders; weeks even months went by. And time, sleeping waking, whenever he lay upon his pallet, toad crept stone, kept watch lustrous eyes. Monsieur Viscount hardly acknowledged affection he came regard ugly despicable animal. The greater part his regard he believed due connection his tutor, rest he set score his humanity, took credit accordingly: whereas truth Monsieur Crapaud incalculable service his master, would lie chatter hours, almost forget his present discomfort recalling past happiness, he described château, gardens, burly tutor, beautiful Madame, laughed his childish remembrances toad's teeth Claude Mignon's pocket; whilst Monsieur Crapaud sat well-bred silent, world comprehension his fiery eyes. Whoever thinks puerile must remember hero Frenchman, young Frenchman, prescriptive right chatter chattering's sake, also he highly cultivated mind his converse with, even highly cultivated intellect ever reliable resource terrors solitary confinement. Foolish wise, however, Monsieur Viscount's attachment strengthened daily; one day something happened showed his pet new light, afforded fresh amusement. The prison much infested certain large black spiders, crawled floor walls; and, Monsieur Viscount lying his pallet, he saw one scramble stone sat Monsieur Crapaud. That good gentleman, whose eyes, till then, fixed usual his master, turned his attention intruder. The spider, conscious danger, suddenly stopped still. Monsieur Crapaud gazed intently his beautiful eyes, bent slightly forward. So remained seconds, spider turned round, began suddenly scramble away. At instant Monsieur Viscount saw his friend's eyes gleam intenser fire, his head jerked forwards; almost seemed something projected his mouth, drawn back rapidity lightning. Then Monsieur Crapaud resumed his position, drew his head, gazed mildly sedately him; _but spider nowhere seen_. Monsieur Viscount burst loud laugh. "Eh, well! Monsieur," said he, "but well-bred part. Who gave leave eat spiders? bolt unmannerly way, moreover." In spite reproof Monsieur Crapaud looked way ashamed himself, I regret state henceforward (with partial humaneness mankind general), Monsieur Viscount amused catching insects (which plentiful) old oyster-she will, setting liberty stone benefit his friend. As him, appeared fish came his net--spiders beetles, slugs snails damp corners, flies, wood-lice found turning large stone, disappeared one other. The wood-lice especial amusement: Monsieur Viscount touched them, shut tight little balls, condition he removed stone, placed like marbles row, Monsieur Crapaud watching proceeding rapt attention. After awhile balls would slowly open begin crawl away; he active wood-louse indeed escaped suction Monsieur Crapaud's tongue, as, his eyes glowing eager enjoyment, he bolted one another, Monsieur Viscount clapped his hands applauded. The grated window fine field spiders insects, piling stones floor, Monsieur Viscount contrived scramble it, fill his friend's oyster-she will prey. One day, year nine months his first arrival prison, he climbed embrasure window, usual, oyster-she will hand. He always chose time he knew court would probably deserted, avoid danger recognized grating. He was, therefore, little startled disturbed his capture fat black spider sound something bumping iron bars. On looking up, he saw string dangling window something attached end it. He drew in, and, he so, he fancied he heard distant sound voices clapped hands, window above. He proceeded examine his prize, found little round pincushion sand, women use polish needles with, that, apparently, used make-weight ensure steady descent neat little letter tied beside it, company small lead pencil. The letter directed "_The prisoner finds this._" Monsieur Viscount opened once. This letter-- "_In prison, 24th Prairial, year 2_. "_Fellow-sufferer, you? long imprisoned? Be good enough answer_." Monsieur Viscount hesitated moment, determined risk all. He tore bit paper, little pencil hurriedly wrote reply:-- "_In secret, June 12, 1794_. "_Louis Archambaud Jean-Marie Arnaud, Vicomte de B., supposed perished massacres September_, 1792. _Keep secret. I imprisoned year nine months. Who are_ you? _how long have_ _been here_?" The letter drawn up, he watched anxiously reply. It came, sheets blank paper. "_Monsieur_,--_We honour reply inquiries, thank frankness. Henri Edouard Clermont, Baron de St. Claire. Valerie de St. Claire. We two days. Accept sympathy misfortunes_." Four words note seized upon Monsieur Viscount's interest--_Valerie de St. Claire_;--and reasons, I pretend explain, he decided she author epistles, demon curiosity forthwith took possession his mind. Who she? she old young? And relation she stand Monsieur le Baron--that wife, sister, daughter? And equally inexplicable Monsieur Viscount determined his mind latter. To make assurance doubly sure, however, he laid trap discover real state case. He wrote letter thanks sympathy, expressed delicate chivalrous politeness nobleman old _régime_, addressed _Madame la Baronne_. The plan succeeded. The next note he received contained sentences:--"_I Baroness. Madame mother is, alas! dead. I father alone. He ill, thanks you, Monsieur, letters, relieve the_ ennui _of imprisonment. Are alone?_" Monsieur Viscount, duty bound, relieved _ennui_ Baron's captivity another epistle. Before answering last question, he turned round involuntarily, looked Monsieur Crapaud sat broken pitcher. The beautiful eyes turned towards him, Monsieur Viscount took his pencil, wrote hastily, "_I alone--I friend._" Henceforward oyster-she will took long time fill, patience seemed harder virtue ever. Perhaps last fact something rapid decline Monsieur Viscount's health. He became paler weaker, fretful. His prayers accompanied greater mental struggles, watered tears. He was, however, positive his assurances Monsieur Crapaud he knew exact nature malady consuming him. It resulted, he said, noxious unwholesome condition his cell; he would entreat Antoine swept out. After difficulty gaoler consented. It nearly month since Monsieur Viscount first startled appearance little pincushion. The stock paper long exhausted. He torn his cambric ruffles write upon, Mademoiselle de St. Claire made havoc her pocket-handkerchiefs purpose. The Viscount feebler ever, Antoine became alarmed. The cell swept next morning. He would come himself, he said, bring another man town help him, work heavy, he touch rheumatism. The man stupid fellow country, week Paris; he never heard Viscount, Antoine would tell prisoner certain young lawyer really died fever prison day before. Monsieur Viscount thanked him; till next morning arrived, he expecting every moment, Monsieur Viscount remembered toad, he would without doubt swept away rest general clearance. At first he thought he would beg leave it, knowledge petty insults class men heaped upon prisoners made feel would probably additional reason taking animal away. There place hide in, would go round room; unless--unless Monsieur Viscount took his hand. And he objected do. All his old feelings repugnance came back; he even got gloves on; his long white hands bare, he could touch toad. It true beast amused him, he chatted it; but, all, piece childish folly--an unmanly way, say least, relieving tedium captivity. What Monsieur Crapaud ugly (and people said venomous) reptile? To folly he condescending! With thoughts, Monsieur Viscount steeled glances his topaz-eyed friend, steps men heard upon stairs, he move window he placed himself, his back stone. The steps came nearer nearer, Monsieur Viscount began whistle--the key rattled lock, Monsieur Viscount heard bit bread fall, toad hastily descended hide usual corners. In moment his resolution gone; another second, would late. He dashed creature, picked up, men came he standing his hands behind him, Monsieur Crapaud quietly safely seated. The room swept, Antoine preparing go, other, eyeing prisoner suspiciously, stopped said sharp sneer, "Does citizen always preserve position?" "Not he," said gaoler, good-naturedly. "He spends his time bed, saves his legs. Come along, François." "I shall come," said other, obstinately. "Let citizen show his hands." "Plague take you!" said Antoine, whisper. "What sulky fit possesses you, comrade? Let poor wretch alone. What wouldst thou his hands? Wait little, thou shall his head." "We heads prisoners either, thou hadst care them," said François, sharply. "I say prisoner secretes something, I see it. Show hands, dog aristocrat!" Monsieur Viscount set his teeth keep speaking, held his hands silence, toad all. Both men started back exclamation, François got behind his comrade, swore his shoulder. Monsieur Viscount stood upright still, smile his white face. "Behold, citizen, I secrete, I desire keep. Behold I left secrete desire! There nothing more." "Throw down!" screamed François; "many witch burnt less--throw down." The colour began flood Monsieur Viscount's face; still he spoke gently, bated breath. "If wish suffer, citizen, let witness I suffered. I must friendless desire friend. I must brought low ask favour. Let Republic give this." "The Republic one safe rule aristocrats," said other; "she gives nothing keep till she pays shaving--once all. She gave one dogs rags dress wound his back with, he made rope his dressings, let window. We games. You may training beast spit poison good citizens. Throw kill it." Monsieur Viscount made reply. His hands moved towards his breast, he holding his golden-eyed friend. There times life brute creation contrasts favourably lords thereof, one them. It hard part now. Antoine, internally cursing his folly bringing companion cell, interfered. "If going stay bitten spit at, François, friend," said he, "I not. Thou art zealous, comrade, dull owl. The Republic far-sighted her wisdom beyond thy coarse ideas, ways taking heads aristocrats one. Dost thou see?" And he tapped his forehead significantly, looked prisoner; so, talking pushing, got his sulky companion cell, locked door them. "And so, friend--my friend!" said Monsieur Viscount, tenderly, "we safe more; long, Crapaud. Something tells I cannot much longer overlooked. A little while, I shall gone; thou wilt have, perchance, another master, I summoned mine." Monsieur Viscount's misgivings just. François, whose stupidity Antoine relied, (as uncommon people stupid respects) clever enough mischievous. Antoine's evident alarm made suspicious, he began talk too-elegant-looking young lawyer imprisoned "in secret," permitted gaoler keep venomous beasts. Antoine examined committed one his cells, Monsieur Viscount summoned revolutionary tribunal. There little need even scanty inquiry days preceded sentence. In every line his beautiful face, marred sickness suffering--in unconquerable dignity, dirt raggedness powerless hide, fatal nobility his birth breeding betrayed. When he returned ante-room, he positively know his fate; his mind moral certainty left hope. The room filled prisoners awaiting trial; and, he entered, his eyes wandered round see familiar faces. They fell upon two figures standing backs him--a tall, fierce-looking man, who, despite his height fierceness, restless, nervous despondency expressed his movements; young girl leant his arm support, whose steady quietude gave her air supporter. Without seeing faces, reasonable reason, Monsieur Viscount decided Baron his daughter, he begged man conducting moment's delay. The man consented. France becoming sick unmitigated carnage, even executioners sometimes indulged pity way change. As Monsieur Viscount approached two turned round, he saw her face--a fair resolute one, ashen hair large eyes. In common almost faces room, blanched suffering; and, fair say, common many them, pervaded lofty calm. Monsieur Viscount never instant doubted his conviction; he drew near said low voice, "Mademoiselle de St. Claire!" The Baron looked first fierce, alarmed. His daughter's face illumined; she turned her large eyes speaker, said simply, "Monsieur le Vicomte?" The Baron apologized, commiserated, sat seat near, look fretful despair; his daughter Monsieur Viscount left standing together. Monsieur Viscount desired say great deal, could say little. The moments went by, hardly word spoken. Valerie asked he knew his fate. "I heard it," he said; "but I morally certain. There one end days." She sighed. "It us. And must suffer, Monsieur, I wish may suffer together. It would comfort father--and me." Her composure vexed him. Just, too, he sensible desire life making fierce struggles his breast. "You seem look forward death great cheerfulness, Mademoiselle." The large eyes raised look surprise irritation his tone. "I think," she said, gently, "that one look forward _to_, _beyond_ it." She stopped hesitated, still watching his face, spoke hurriedly diffidently:-- "Monsieur, seems impertinent make suggestions you, doubtless full fund consolation; I remember, child, going hear preaching monk famous his eloquence. He said his text Scriptures--it mind to-day--'_There wicked cease troubling, weary rest._' The man becoming impatient. Adieu! Monsieur. A thousand thanks thousand blessings." She offered her cheek, ray increased colour, Monsieur Viscount stooped kissed it, thick mist gathering his eyes, he could see her face. "Adieu! Valerie!" "Adieu! Louis!" So met, parted; Monsieur Viscount went back his prison, he flattered last link broken chain earthly interests. When he reached cell he tired, lay down, seconds soft scrambling floor announced return Monsieur Crapaud his hiding-place. With one wrinkled leg another he clambered stone, Monsieur Viscount started he saw him. "Friend Crapaud! I actually forgotten thee. I fancied I said adieu last time;" he gave choked sigh, Monsieur Crapaud could expected understand. In five minutes he sprang suddenly. "Monsieur Crapaud, I long live, time must lost making will." Monsieur Crapaud wise express astonishment; his master began hunt tidy-looking stone (paper cambric end). They rough dirty; necessity made Viscount inventive, he took couple rubbed together till he polished both. Then he pulled little pencil, next half hour composed wrote busily. When done he lay down, read his friend. This Monsieur Viscount's last Testament:-- "_To successor cell._ "To Providence chosen inheritor sorrows captivity, I desire make another bequest. There prison toad. He tamed man (peace his memory!) tenanted cell me. He friend companion nearly two years sad imprisonment. He sat bedside, fed hand, shared confidence. He ugly, he beautiful eyes; he silent, he attentive; he brute, I wish men France respect his superiors! He faithful. May never worse friend! He feeds upon insects, I accustomed procure him. Be kind him; he repay it. Like men, I bequeath I would take I could. "Fellow-sufferer, adieu! GOD comfort He comforted me! The sorrows life sharp short; joys next life eternal. Think sometimes commends his friend pity, prayers. "This last testament Louis Archambaud Jean-Marie Arnaud, Vicomte de B----." Monsieur Viscount's last testament difficulty squeezed surface larger stones. Then he hid priest hidden _his_ bequest long ago, lay dream Monsieur Preceptor, met last. The next day one anxious suspense. In evening, usual, list guillotined next morning, brought prison; Monsieur Viscount begged sight it. It brought him. First list Antoine! Halfway his name, "Louis de B----," little lower his fascinated gaze fell upon names stirred his heart passion regret he fancied would never feel again, "Henri de St. Claire, Valerie de St. Claire." Her eyes seemed shine gathering twilight, her calm voice echo his ears. "_It mind to-day. There wicked cease troubling, weary rest._" _There_! He buried his face prayed. He disturbed unlocking door, new gaoler appeared Antoine! The poor wretch seemed overpowered terror. He begged imprisoned last night Monsieur Viscount. It matter hours, die daybreak, his request granted. Antoine's entrance turned current Monsieur Viscount's thoughts. No selfish reflections now. He must comfort poor creature, whose death he unintentional because. Antoine's first anxiety Monsieur Viscount bear witness gaoler treated kindly, earned blessing curse Monsieur le Curé, whose powerful presence seemed haunt still. On score he soon set rest, came old, old story. He bad man. If his life come again, he would differently. Did Monsieur Viscount think hope? Would Monsieur Viscount recognized himself, could he, two years ago, seen he now? Kneeling rough, uncultivated figure, pleading eloquence he could master rough uncultivated heart, great Truths Christianity--so great simple application needs! The violet eyes never appealed tenderly, soft voice never softer now, he strove explain ignorant soul, cardinal doctrines Faith Repentance, Charity, earnestness perhaps effectual his preaching. Monsieur Viscount quite much astonished flattered success his instructions. The faith he laid hold mortal struggles, seemed almost "come natural" (as people say) Antoine. With abundant tears he professed deepest penitence his past life, time he accepted doctrine Atonement natural remedy, never seemed doubt Infinite Mercy cover his infinite guilt. It orthodox even he doubted (which he not) sincerity gaoler's contrition belief, Monsieur Viscount could done nothing envy easy nature Antoine's convictions. He forgot difference respective capabilities! When night far advanced men rose knees, Monsieur Viscount persuaded Antoine lie his pallet, gaoler's heavy breathing told he asleep, Monsieur Viscount felt relieved alone more--alone, except Monsieur Crapaud, whose round fiery eyes open usual. The simplicity he obliged explain truths Divine Love Antoine, signal service Monsieur Viscount himself. It left excuse intricacies doubt, refined minds often torture themselves; he paced feebly cell, long-withheld peace he striven since his imprisonment seemed flood his soul. How blessed--how undeservedly blessed--was his fate! Who he short, mitigated sufferings, crown victory near? The way seemed long come, short look back upon, golden gates almost reached, everlasting doors open. A hours, then--! Monsieur Viscount buried his worn face his hands, tears trickled his fingers literally tears joy. He groped his way stone, pushed straw close it, lay ground rest, watched Monsieur's Crapaud's fiery eyes. And he lay, faces seemed rise darkness, take form features face priest, gaze unutterable benediction. And his mind, like familiar piece music, awoke words written fly-leaf little book; coming back, sleepily dreamily, again-- "_Souvenez-vous du Sauveur! Souvenez-vous du Sauveur_!" (Remember Saviour!) In remembrance he fell asleep. Monsieur Viscount's sleep hours without dream. Then began disturbed uneasy consciousness sleeping long, enables people awake whatever hour resolved upon. At last became intolerable, wearied he was, he awoke. It broad daylight, Antoine snoring beside him. Surely cart would come soon, executions generally early hour. But time went on, one came, Antoine awoke. The hours suspense passed heavily, last steps key rattled lock. The door opened, gaoler appeared jug milk loaf. With strange smile he set down. "A good appetite you, citizens." Antoine flew him. "Comrade! used friends. Tell me, it? Is execution deferred?" "The execution taken place last," said other, significantly; "_Robespierre dead!_" he vanished. Antoine uttered shriek joy. He wept, he laughed, he cut capers, flinging Monsieur Viscount's feet, he kissed rapturously. When he raised his eyes Monsieur Viscount's face, his transports moderated. The last shock much, he seemed almost stupor. Antoine got pallet, dragged blanket him, broke bread milk, played nurse more. On day thousands prisoners city Paris alone awoke shadow death hope life. The Reign Terror ended! CHAPTER III. It year Grace early present century. We beautiful country beautiful France. It château more. It same, changed. The unapproachable elegance, inviolable security, witnessed invasion. The right wing château ruins, traces fire upon blackened walls; there, broken statue roofless temple sad memorials Revolution. Within restored part château, however, looks well. Monsieur Viscount fortunate, rich man his father, yet regained enough his property live comfort, and, he thinks, luxury. The long rooms little less elegant former days, Madame present Viscountess's boudoir model taste. Not far another room, forms singular contrast. This room belongs Monsieur Viscount. It small, one window. The floor walls bare, contains furniture; floor worn-out pallet, lies stone, broken pitcher, little frame wall preserved crumpled bit paper like fly-leaf little book, half-effaced inscription, deciphered Monsieur Viscount one else. Above window written large letters, date word REMEMBER. Monsieur Viscount likely forget, he afraid prosperity lest spoil him. It evening, Monsieur Viscount strolling along terrace Madame his arm. He one offer her, empty sleeve pinned his breast, bit ribbon stirred breeze. Monsieur Viscount idle since saw last; faith taught die, taught also live--an honourable, useful life. It evening, air comes perfumed bed violets Monsieur Viscount kneeling. Madame (who fair face ashen hair) stands her little hand his shoulder, her large eyes upon violets. "My friend! friend! friend!" It Monsieur Viscount's voice, sound it, rustle among violets sends perfume high air. Then parted leaves come forth first dirty wrinkled leg, dirty wrinkled head gleaming eyes, Monsieur Crapaud crawls self-satisfied dignity Monsieur Viscount's outstretched hand. So stay laughing chatting, Monsieur Viscount bids his friend good-night, holds towards Madame she may same. But Madame (who enjoy Monsieur Crapaud's society prison) cannot induced scratch his head delicately tip her white finger. But she respects greatly, distance, she says. Then go back along terrace, met man-servant Monsieur Viscount's livery. Is possible Antoine, his shock head covered powder? Yes; grating voice, mental change avails subdue, his, he announces Monsieur le Curé arrived. It old Curé village (who survived troubles Revolution), many evenings he spends château, many times closing acts noble life recounted him, life his old friend he hopes ere long see--of Monsieur Preceptor. He kindly welcomed Monsieur Madame, pass together château. And Monsieur Viscount's steps ceased echo terrace, Monsieur Crapaud buries among violets. * * * * * Monsieur Viscount dead, Madame sleeps also his side; possessions descended son. Not least valued among case glass front sides, which, seated upon stone body toad stuffed exquisite skill, whose head gleam eyes genuine topaz. Above letters gold date, inscription:-- "MONSIEUR THE VISCOUNT'S FRIEND." ADIEU! THE YEW-LANE GHOSTS CHAPTER I. "Cowards cruel." OLD PROVERB. This story begins fine autumn afternoon when, end field shadows wayside trees stalking like long thin giants, man boy sat side side upon stile. They happy-looking pair. The boy looked uncomfortable, he wanted get away dared go. The man looked uncomfortable also; one ever seen look otherwise, strange he never professed object life his pleasure gratification. Not troubling consideration law principle--of his duty people's comfort--he consistently spent his whole time energies trying jolly; though grown-up young man, far every appearance failing attempt. From seen he estimable characters, shall help; he must appear story, he may well described. If constant self-indulgence answered well done, he would fine-looking young man; was, habits his life fast destroying his appearance. His hair would golden kept clean. His figure tall strong; custom slinking places he business be, lounging corners he nothing do, given hopeless slouch matter beauty he might almost well knock-kneed. His eyes would handsome lids less red; he ever looked face, would seen blue. His complexion fair nature discoloured drink. His manner something sneak swagger, he generally wore his cap a-one-side, carried his hands his pockets short stick his arm, whistled one passed him. His chief characteristic, perhaps, habit he kicking. Indoors he kicked furniture, road he kicked stones, he lounged wall he kicked it; he kicked animals human beings he felt sure would kick again. It said he announced his intention "turning steady, settling, getting wed." The object his choice prettiest girl village, good she pretty. To say truth, time Bessy felt unkindly towards yellow-haired lad; his conduct long put gulf them, conceit scamp would attempted pass. However, he flattered he "knew lasses meant said no;" strength knowledge he presumed far enough elicit rebuff hearty unmistakable week he laughing stock village. There mistake time "no" meant; his admiration turned hatred almost intense, he went faster "to bad" ever. It Bessy's little brother sat stile; "Beauty Bill," he called, large share he possessed family good looks. The lad one people seem born favourites. He handsome, merry, intelligent; and, well brought up, well-conducted amiable--the pride pet village. Why Mother Muggins shop let goody side her scales justice drop lower one lollipop Bill lad, exempt unwonted smiles her general anathema urchin race? There honest boys parish, paid treacle-sticks sterling copper realm! The roughs village proud him, would showed good nature ways little his benefit his father kept somewhat severe watch upon his habits conduct. Indeed, good parents strict home counterbalanced evils popularity Beauty Bill, and, whole, he little spoilt, well deserved favour he met with. It cover friendly patronage his companion detaining him; but, circumstances considered, Bill felt suspicious gratified, wished Bully Tom anywhere he was. The man threw one leg like pendulum clock. "Night school's opened, eh?" he inquired; back swung pendulum Bill's shins. "Yes;" boy screwed his legs one side. "You do not go, you?" "Yes, I do," said Bill, trying feel ashamed fact, "Father cannot spare day-school now, Bessy persuaded let go nights." Bully Tom's face looked shade darker, pendulum took swing fortunate lad avoided; conversation continued every appearance civility. "You come back Yew-lane, I suppose?" "Yes." "Why, there is one lives way old Johnson; must come back alone?" "Of course, I do," said Bill, beginning feel vaguely uncomfortable. "It must dark school looses?" next inquiry; boy's discomfort increased, he hardly knew why, he answered-- "There is moon." "So is," said Bully Tom, tone polite assent; "and there is weathercock church-steeple I never heard either  them coming help body, whatever happened." Bill's discomfort become alarm. "Why, could happen?" he asked. "I do not understand you." His companion whistled, looked air, kicked vigorously, said nothing. Bill extraordinarily brave, he fair amount spirit sense; shrewd suspicion Bully Tom trying frighten him, he almost made his mind run there. Curiosity, however, vague alarm he could throw off, made stay little information. "I wish you would it!" he exclaimed, impatiently. "What could happen? No one ever comes along Yew-lane; would not hurt me." "I know one ever comes near help it," reply; "so, sure, could not get set upon. And pious lad sort would not mind kind. Not like ghosts, anything that." And Bully Tom looked round his companion; fact disagreeable rarity. "I do not believe ghosts," said Bill, stoutly. "Of course do not," sneered his tormentor; "you are well educated. Some people does, though. I suppose seen does. Some people thinks murdered men walk. P'raps people thinks man murdered Yew-lane walks." "What man?" gasped Bill, feeling chilly spine. "Him riding cross-roads dragged Yew-lane, his head cut never found, his body buried churchyard," said Bully Tom, rush superior information; "and I know is, I thought he walked Yew-lane, lane, I would not go within five mile dusk--that is all. But I am book-larned." The two last statements true nothing else man said; holding his feet examining his boots his head a-one-side, considering probable efficiency flesh blood, he slid his perch, "loafed" slowly street, whistling kicking stones he went along. As Beauty Bill, he fled home fast his legs would carry him. By door stood Bessy, washing clothes; turned her pretty face he came up. "You are late, Bill," she said. "Go get tea, it is set out. It is night-school night, thou knows, Master Arthur always likes his class time." He lingered, she continued--"John Gardener afternoon potatoes, he says Master Arthur expecting friend." Bill heed piece news, slight flush his sister's face she delivered it; he wondering whether Bully Tom said mere invention frighten him, whether truth it. "Bessy!" he said, "was man ever murdered Yew-lane?" Bessy occupied her thoughts, notice anxiety question. "I believe was," she answered carelessly, "somewhere there. It is hundred years ago more. There is old gravestone churchyard wall, odd verse it. They say parish clerk wrote it. But get tea, you will late, father'll angry;" Bessy took her tub departed. Poor Bill! Then true. He began pull his trousers look his grazed legs; thoughts his aching shins, Bully Tom's cruelty, unavoidable night-school, possible ghost, much him, he burst tears. CHAPTER II. "There birds bushes, In meadows lies lamb, How I wonder they are ever Half frightened I am?" C.F. ALEXANDER. The night-school drawing close. The attendance good, room looked cheerful. In one corner Rector teaching group grown-up men, (better late never) zealously learning read; another schoolmaster flourishing his stick map he concluded his lesson geography. By fire sat Master Arthur, Rector's son, surrounded his class, front stood Beauty Bill. Master Arthur popular people, especially his pupils. The boys anxious get his class, loath leave it. They admired his great height, his merry laugh, variety walking-sticks he brought him, his funny way explaining pictures. He methodical teacher, rather apt give unexpected lessons subjects he happened interested himself; he clear simple way explaining anything, impressed memory, he took great deal pains his way. Bill especially devoted him. He often wished Master Arthur could get rich, take his man-servant; he thought he like brush his clothes take care his sticks. He great interest growth his moustache whiskers. For time past Master Arthur trick pulling his upper lip whilst he teaching; occasionally provoked whisper "Moostarch, guvernor!" two unruly members his class; never till to-night Bill seen anything line answered his expectations. Now, however, he stood young gentleman, fire-light fell distinct growth hair, Bill's interest became absorbed exclusion perfunctory attention lesson hand. Would Master Arthur grow beard? Would his moustache short like pictures Prince Albert, long pointed like great man whose portrait he seen papers? He calculating probable effect either style, order given put away books, thought time diverted came back again--his walk home. Poor Bill! his fears returned double force awhile forgotten. He dawdled books, he hunted wrong places his cap comforter, he lingered till last boy clattered doorway, left group elders closed proceedings locked school. But delay impossible. The whole party moved moonlight, Rector his son, schoolmaster teachers, commenced, sedate parish gossip, whilst Bill trotted behind, wondering whether possible impossible business would take one his way. But turning point reached, Rector destroyed his hopes. "None us go way, I think," said he, lightly grievance case; "however, it is far. Good-night, boy!" And volley good-nights, cheerful voices passed village. Bill stood till quite died away, silent, he turned lane. The cold night-wind crept his ears, made uncomfortable noises among trees, blew clouds face moon. He almost wished moon. The shifting shadows his feet, sudden patches light unexpected objects, startled him, he thought he felt less frightened quite dark. Once he ran bit, he resolved brave, reasonable; he repeated scraps lessons, hymns, last Sunday's Collect, divert compose his mind; plan seemed answer, he determined go Catechism, question answer, he hoped might carry end his unpleasant journey. He asked question considerable dignity, reply, sudden gleam moonlight lit round object ditch. Bill's heart seemed grow cold, he thought his senses would forsaken him. Could head ----? No! nearer inspection proved turnip; one came think it, would rather conspicuous place murdered man's skull lost many years. My hero must ridiculed much his fears. The terrors visit childhood less real overpowering unreasonable; excite wanton cruelty. Moreover, he little lad, Yew-lane daylight dark without fears, till Bully Tom's tormenting suggestions alarmed him. Even now, he reached avenue yews lane took name, passed gloomy shade, he tried brave. He tried think good GOD Who takes care His children, Whom darkness light alike. He thought he taught angels, wondered one near now, wished he could see him, Abraham good people seen angels. In short, poor lad his best apply he taught present emergency, likely he done he would worse; was, he little frightened, shall see. Yew-lane--cool dark hottest sunshine lay beyond it--a loitering place lovers--the dearly-loved play-place generations children sultry summer days--looked grim vault-like, narrow streaks moonlight peeping rare intervals make darkness felt! Moreover, really damp cold, favourable courage. At certain point Yew-lane skirted corner churchyard, crossed another road, thus forming "four-want-way," suicides buried times past. This road old high-road, mail coach ran, along which, night this, hundred years ago, horseman rode his last ride. As he passed church his fatal journey anything warn soon his headless body would buried beneath shadow? Bill wondered. He wondered he old young--what sort horse he rode--whose cruel hands dragged shadow yews slew him, his head hidden, why. Did church look same, moon shine brightly, night century ago? Bully Tom right. The weathercock moon sit still, whatever happens. The boy watched gleaming high road lay beyond dark aisle trees, till he fancied he could hear footfalls solitary horse--and yet, no! The sound upon hard road, nearer; clatter hoofs, something--and rustle--and Bill's blood seemed freeze his veins, he saw white figure, wrapped seemed shroud, glide shadow yews move slowly lane. When reached road paused, raised long arm warningly towards moment, vanished direction churchyard. What would consequence intense fright poor lad experienced anyone say, moment church clock begun strike nine. The familiar sound, close his ears, roused first shock, ceased he contrived make desperate rally his courage, flew road, crossed two fields lay home without looking behind him. CHAPTER III. "It her real _grief heart_, acute, children's sorrows often are. "We beheld opposite windows--and, seen thus little distance, many people's sorrows might seem equally trivial, equally deserving ridicule!" HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN. When Bill got home he found household busy much practical subject ghosts haunted yew-trees. Bessy ill. She felt pain her side day, towards night become violent doctor sent for, pronounced pleurisy, sent her bed. He coming downstairs Bill burst house. The mother much occupied her daughter notice lad's condition; doctor's sharp eyes saw something amiss, he inquired was. Bill hammered stammered, stopped short. The doctor tall, stout, comfortable-looking man, he looked he could not believe ghosts. A slight frown, however, come his comfortable face, he laid two fingers Bill's wrist he repeated his question. "Please, sir," said Bill, "I have seen--" "A mad dog?" suggested doctor. "No, sir." "A mad bull?" "No, sir," said Bill, desperately, "I have seen ghost." The doctor exploded fit laughter, looked comfortable ever. "And _where_ see ghost?" he inquired, professional voice, he took his coat-tails warmed fire. "In Yew-lane, sir; I am sure I see it," said Bill, half crying; "it white, beckoned me." "That is say saw white gravestone, tree moonlight, one classmates dressed table-cloth. It moonshine, depend upon it," said doctor, chuckle his joke; "take advice, boy, do not give way foolish fancies." At point mother spoke-- "If his father knew, sir, he would got fads his head, he would soon flog  them him." "His father good one," said doctor; "a little fond stick, perhaps. There," he added, good-naturedly, slipping sixpence Bill's hand, "get new knife, boy, cut good thick stick, next ghost meet, lay hold let taste it." Bill tried thank him, somehow his voice choked, doctor turned his mother. "The boy frightened," he said, "and upset. Give supper, put bed." And good gentleman departed. Bill duly feasted sent rest. His mother mention matter her husband, she knew he would angry; occupied real anxiety her daughter, she soon forgot herself. Consequently, next night-school night she sent Bill "clean himself," hurried his tea, packed off, nothing happened. The boy's feelings since night apparition enviable. He could neither eat sleep. As he lay bed night, he kept his face covered clothes, dreading he peeped room phantom murdered horseman would beckon dark corners. Lying till dawn broke cocks began crow, he would look cautiously forth, seeing grey light corners empty, figure door Yew-lane Ghost, his mother's faded print dress hanging nail, would drop his head fall wearily asleep. The day better, hour brought nearer next night school; Bessy's illness made his mother busy, he never could find right moment ask her sympathy his fears, still less could he feel able overcome them. And night-school came round again, he sat, gulping mouthfuls food, wondering he begin tell his mother he neither dare, could, would, go Yew-lane night. He opened his lips father came in, asked loud voice "Why Bill off." This effectually put stop confidences, boy ran house. Not, however, school. He made one two desperate efforts determination, gave altogether. He _could_ go! He wondering he himself, struck he would go whilst daylight look grave odd verse Bessy spoken. He difficulty finding it. It marked large ugly stone, inscription green places almost effaced. SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF EPHRAIM GARNETT-- He read far voice close said-- "You will late school, young chap." Bill looked up, his horror beheld Bully Tom standing road kicking churchyard wall. "Are not going?" he asked, Bill speak. "Not to-night," said Bill, crimson cheeks. "Larking, eh?" said Bully Tom. "My eyes, will not father give you!" he began move off. "Stop!" shouted Bill agony; "do not tell him, Tom. That would dirty trick. I will go next time, I indeed; I cannot go to-night. I am larking, I am scared. You will not tell?" "Not time, maybe," reply; "but I would not shoes play game next night;" he went. Bill thought well quit churchyard place he likely seen; he never played truant before, next hour two thoroughly miserable he slunk premises neighbouring farm, finally took refuge she would, began consider his position. He would remain hidden till nine of the clock, go home. If nothing said, well good; unless accident afterwards betray him. But his mother asked questions school? He dared not, he would not, tell lie; yet would result truth coming out? There could doubt his father would beat him. Bill thought again, decided he could bear thrashing, sight Yew-lane Ghost; he remained he was, wondering would be, he get next school-night came. The prospect hopeless, poor lad wearied anxiety wakeful nights, he almost asleep he startled church clock striking nine; and, jumping up, he ran home. His heart beat heavily he crossed threshold; his mother still absorbed thoughts Bessy, he went bed unquestioned. The next day passed without awkward remarks, satisfactory; night-school day came again, Bill felt he worse position ever. He played truant success; he aware would second time. Bully Tom spiteful, Master Arthur might come "look up" his recreant pupil, Bill's father would know all. On morning much-dreaded day, his mother sent Rectory fetch little delicacy promised Bessy's dinner. He generally found rather amusing go there. He liked peep pretty garden, look Master Arthur, sit kitchen watch cook, wonder she dishes bright things decorated walls. To-day quite different. He avoided gardens, he afraid seen his teacher, though cook unusual display pots pans operation, he sat corner kitchen indifferent everything thought Yew-lane Ghost. The dinner Bessy put two saucers, cook gave his hands she asked kindly his sister, added-- "You do not look over-well yourself, lad! What is amiss?" Bill answered he quite well, hurried house avoid inquiries. He becoming afraid everyone! As he passed garden he thought gardener, wondered he would help him. He young good-natured; he taken late coming see Bessy, Bill his ideas upon point; finally, he small class night-school. Bill wondered whether he screwed his courage to-night go, John Gardener would walk back pleasure hearing latest accounts Bessy. But hopes sort cut Master Arthur's voice shouting garden-- "Hi, there! I want you, Willie! Come here, I say." Bill ran evergreens, among flower-beds sunshine he saw--first, John Gardener driving mowing-machine velvety grass Master Arthur's nose, getting private interview him. Secondly, Master Arthur himself, sitting ground his terrier his lap, directing proceedings means donkey-headed stick elaborately carved ears; thirdly, Master Arthur's friend. Now little bits gossip fly; heard dining-room, conveyed parlour-maid kitchen, passed kitchen village, Master Arthur's friend clever young gentleman; consequently Beauty Bill anxious see him. As, however, clever young gentleman lying his back grass, his hat flattened his face keep sun, open book lying face upon his waistcoat keep place, otherwise quite immovable, like young gentlemen, Bill feel much wiser looking him. He better view soon, however, Master Arthur began poke his friend's legs donkey-headed stick, exhort get up. "Hi! Bartram, get up! Here is prime pupil. See turn out. You may examine like. Willie: gentleman clever gentleman, must keep wits you. _He'll_ put questions you, I tell you! There is much difference his head mine, mine head stick." And Master Arthur flourished his "one-legged donkey," he called it, air, added, "Bartram! lazy lout! _will_ get take interest humble efforts good fellow-creatures?" Thus adjured, Mr. Bartram sat jerk threw his book his boots, his hat it, looked Bill. Now Bill gardener grinning, always Master Arthur's funny speeches, Bill found clever gentleman looking him, he straightened his face quickly. The gentleman like his friend ("nothing near handsome," Bill reported home), he large prominent forehead he looked he bald. When he sat up, he suddenly screwed his eyes peculiar way, pulled double gold eye-glass, fixed his nose, stared second; his eyes unexpectedly opened full extent (they small ones), took sharp survey Bill top his spectacles; ended, he lay back his elbow without speaking. Bill decided Mr. Bartram proud, rather mad, disagreeable gentleman he ever saw; he felt sure could see well he (Bill) could, wore spectacles peculiar kind pride vain-glory he could exactly specify. Master Arthur seemed think, rate, he civil, began talk boy himself. "Why school last time, Willie? could not mother spare you?" "Yes, Sir." "Then did not come?" said Master Arthur, evident astonishment. Poor Bill! He stammered he stammered doctor, finally gasped-- "Please, Sir, I scared." "Scared? What of?" "Ghosts," murmured Bill ghostly whisper. Mr. Bartram raised little. Master Arthur seemed confounded. "Why, little goose! How never afraid before?" "Please, Sir, I saw one night." Mr. Bartram took another look top his eye-glass sat bolt upright, John Gardener stayed his machine listened, poor Bill told whole story Yew-lane Ghost. When finished, gardener, behind Master Arthur, said-- "I have heard something this, Sir, village," added Bill could hear. "Eh, what?" said Master Arthur. "Willie, take machine drive garden a-bit wherever like. Now, John." Willie like sent away interesting point. Another time he would enjoyed driving short grass, seeing jump like little green fountain front him; his whole mind absorbed words he caught intervals conversation going John young gentlemen. What could mean? Mr. Bartram seemed awakened extraordinary energy, talking rapidly. Bill heard words "lime-light" "large sheet," thought must planning magic-lantern exhibition, puzzled catching word "turnip." At last, he rounding corner bed geraniums, he distinctly heard Mr. Bartram ask-- "They cut man's head off, did not they?" Then talking ghost, all! Bill gave machine jerk, his dismay sliced branch one geraniums. What done? He must tell Master Arthur, he could interrupt now; he drove, feeling much dispirited, means cheered hearing shouts laughter party grass. When one puzzled spirits, consolation hear people laughing private joke; moreover, Bill felt still subject murdered man his ghost, merriment unsuitable. Whatever going on, quite evident Mr. Bartram leading spirit it, Bill could see Master Arthur waving one legged donkey ecstasy, he clapped his friend back till eye-glass danced upon his nose. At last Mr. Bartram threw back closing discussion, said loud enough Bill hear-- "You never heard bully was not coward." Bill thought Bully Tom, he said he dared risk chance meeting ghost, began think clever young gentleman, all. Just Master Arthur called him; he took bit broken geranium went. "Oh, Willie!" said Master Arthur, "we have talking misfortunes--geranium? fiddle-sticks! put button-hole--your misfortunes, I say, to-night rate intend help them. John--ahem!--will be--ahem!--engaged to-night, unable take his class usual; gentleman kindly consented fill his place ("Hear, hear," said gentleman alluded to), you will come to-night, like good lad, he I walk back you; see ghost, good company. But, mind, one condition. You must say anything it--about walking back you, I mean--to anybody. Say nothing; get ready come school usual. You understand?" "Yes, Sir," said Bill; "and I am much obliged you, Sir, gentleman well." Nothing said, Bill made his best bow retired. As he went he heard Master Arthur say gardener-- "Then you will go town once, John. We shall want things soon possible. You would better take pony, we will list ready you." Bill heard words; he left grounds laughter young gentlemen rang road. What mean? CHAPTER IV "The night pitmirk; wind soughed amid headstones railings gentry (for must die), black corbies steeple-holes cackled crawed fearsome manner." MANSIE WAUGH. Bill early night-school. No his class arrived, he took corner fire sacred first-comers, watched gradual gathering school. Presently Master Arthur appeared, close behind came his friend. Mr. Bartram Lindsay looked attractive he done garden. When standing, he elegant though plain-looking young man, neat his dress, admirable figure. He apt stand still silent length time, habit holding his chin air, led people say he "held high." This opinion Bill formed, he rather alarmed hearing Master Arthur pressing his friend take his class instead backward one, gardener usually presided; he proportionably relieved Mr. Bartram steadily declined. "To say truth, Bartram," said young gentleman, "I much obliged you, I used boys, prefer them." Then came schoolmaster. "Mr. Lindsay going take John's class? Thank you, Sir. I have put books; want anything else, Sir, p'raps you will mention it. When done reading, perhaps, Sir, kindly draft writing, take upper classes arithmetic, do not object, Sir." Mr. Lindsay object. "If picture two," he said. "Thank you. Know letters? All right. Different stages progression. Very good. I have doubt shall get together." "Between ourselves, Bartram," whispered Master Arthur his friend's ear, "the class composed boys ought school, have not; been, none better it. Some call 'read Testament,' confound b meet them. They one point general information--namely, know told them, none know next time. I call rag-tag bob-tail class. John says like forced tulips. They will not blossom simultaneously. He cannot get one standard reading." Mr. Lindsay laughed said-- "He better read less, try little general oral instruction. Perhaps do not remember cannot understand;"--and Rector coming moment, business evening commenced. Having afterwards cross school something, Bill passed new teacher his class, came conclusion "get together," well too. The rag-tag bob-tail shone night, afterwards loud praises lesson. "It clear," "He patient." Indeed, patience one great secret Mr. Lindsay's teaching; he waited long answer he generally got it. His pupils obliged exert hope passed over, everybody waiting. Finally, Bill's share arithmetic lesson converted Master Arthur's friend. He _was_ clever young gentleman, kind one too. The lesson interesting--the clever young gentleman, standing (without his eye-glass) blackboard, strict yet entertaining, obviously competent, pleasantly kind, Bill, liked arithmetic, (like intelligent children) appreciated good teaching, time think Yew-lane Ghost till lesson ended. It till hymn began (they always ended night-school singing), he remembered it. Then, he shouting his might Bishop Ken's glorious old lines-- "Keep me, oh keep me, King kings," he caught Mr. Lindsay's eyes fixed him, back came thoughts his terrible fright, little shame his timidity. Which us trusts "defence Most High?" Bill lingered he done last time, went "grown-ups." It raining, ground wet sludgy, though fair overhead. The wind cold, too, Mr. Lindsay began cough violently, Bill felt rather ashamed taking far his way, damp chilly lane, began wonder whether he could summon courage go alone. The result was, effort he said-- "Please, Mr. Lindsay, Sir, I think will not like come far cold night. I will try manage, like." Mr. Lindsay laid one hand Bill's shoulder, said quietly-- "No, thank you, boy, we will come you, Thank you, same." "Nevertheless, Bartram," said Master Arthur, "I wish could keep cough quiet--it spoil everything. A boy eating peppermints shade his copy-book night. I box his ears; I wish I seized goodies, might kept quiet." "Thank you," reply, "I abhor peppermint; I got lozenges, satisfy you. And I smell ghosts, I smother pocket-handkerchief." Master Arthur laughed boisterously. "We shall smell one brimstone it. I hope he will not set fire, scenic effect stronger bargained for." This beginning desultory conversation carried intervals two young gentlemen, which, though Bill heard every sentence, he could not understand one. He made one effort discover Master Arthur alluding to, satisfactory result, shall see. "Please, Master Arthur," he said desperately, "you do not think there will two ghosts, you, Sir?" "I say," said Master Arthur, slowly gravity Bill felt sure he making fun him, "I say, Bill, place haunted limit number ghosts--fifty quite likely one. What say, Bartram?" "Quite so," said Bartram. Bill made attempts understand mystery. He listened, grew bewildered dark hints he heard, never understood meant end came; (as uncommon) he wondered he could stupid, he seen first. They reached turning-point, passed dark lane, wind shuddering shivering among trees, Bill shuddered shivered too, felt glad young gentlemen him, all. Mr. Lindsay pulled his watch. "Well?" said his friend. "Ten minutes nine." Then walked silence, Master Arthur one arm his friend's, one-legged donkey other; Mr. Lindsay his hand Bill's shoulder. "I _should_ like pipe!" said Master Arthur presently; "it is abominably damp." "What fellow are," said Mr. Lindsay. "Out question! With wind setting lane too! talk cough--which better, by-the-bye." "What fellow _you_ are!" retorted other. "Bartram, oddest creature I know. What ever take up, drive so. Now I hardly got lark afloat I am sick it. I wish you would tell two things--first, grave to-night? and, secondly, made take young friend's warmly?" "One answer serve questions," said Mr. Lindsay. "The truth is, old fellow, young friend--[and Bill felt certain 'young friend' himself]--has look little chap I chum school--Regy Gordon. I do not talk often, I cannot well; he killed--think it, man!--_killed_ piece bullying this! When found him, he quite stiff speechless; he lived hours, he said two words--my name, amen." "Amen?" said Master Arthur, inquiringly. "Well, see surgeon said go, telegraphed his friends; long way off, he sinking rapidly; old Doctor room, half heart-broken, he saw Gordon move his hands together, he said, 'If boy knows prayers Gordon minor used say, let come say him;' I did. So I knelt his bed said them, old Doctor kneeling sobbing like child; I done, Regy moved his lips said 'Amen;' he said 'Lindsay!' smiled, then--" Master Arthur squeezed his friend's arm tightly, said nothing, young men silent; Bill could restrain his tears. It seemed saddest story he ever heard, Mr. Lindsay's hand upon his shoulder shook intolerably whilst he speaking, he taken away, made Bill worse, he fairly sobbed. "What blubbering about, young 'un?" said Mr. Lindsay. "He better us, good boy see day;" young gentleman put his hand back again, steady now. "What became fellow?" said Master Arthur. "He taken away, course. Sent abroad, I believe. It hushed up. And know," added Mr. Lindsay, "why native indolence roused get cad taught lesson, many time I wished GOD wishes late, bully taught _in time_. But one could thrash him; one durst complain. However, let us change subject, old fellow! I have got long since: though sometimes I think wish see Regy helps keep decent sort fellow. But I saw likeness morning, startled me; hear story, seemed like dream--the Gordon affair again. I suppose rustic nerves tougher; however, village blackguard shall not chance committing murder cure him!" "I believe half wanted undertake cure yourself," said Master Arthur. Mr. Lindsay laughed. "I minute. Fancy father's feelings I come home black eye encounter pot-house bully! You know I put foot tender secret man's, offering performer!" "How?" Mr. Lindsay lowered his voice, Bill could hear he said, recognize imitation John Gardener. "He said, 'I would rather it, _you_ please, Sir. The fact is, I am partial young woman myself!' After that, I could leave John defend his young woman's belongings." "Gently!" exclaimed Master Arthur. "There Yew Walk." From moment conversation carried whispers, Bill's mystification. The young gentlemen recovered spirits, kept exploding smothered chuckles laughter. "Cold work he is waiting long!" whispered one. "Do not know. His head's cover, remember!" said other: laughed. "Bet sixpence he is smearing his hand brimstone last half hour." "Do not smell yet, though." "He will patent aphis-destroyer rose-garden months come." "Sharp work eyelids gets sheet." They close Yews, wind came peculiar chill, passing vault. Mr. Bartram Lindsay stooped down, whispered Bill's ear. "Listen, lad. We cannot go lane you, want see ghost, do not want ghost see us. Do not frightened, go usual. And mind--when see white figure, point arm _towards Church_, scream loud like. Can this?" "Yes, Sir," whispered Bill. "Then you. We shall creep quietly behind trees; shall not hurt, I promise you." Bill summoned his courage, plunged shadows. What could meaning Mr. Lindsay's strange orders? Should he ever courage lift his arm towards church face awful apparition murdered man? And he did, would unquiet spirit take hint, go back grave, Bill knew corner he must point? Left alone, his terrors began return; he listened eagerly see if, amid ceaseless soughing wind among long yew branches, he could hear rustle young men's footsteps crept behind. But he could distinguish nothing. The hish-wishing thin leaves incessant, wind dexterous tormenting tricks played sounds produced, whole place seemed alive phantom rustlings footsteps; Bill felt Master Arthur right, "no limit" number ghosts! At last he could see end avenue. There among last trees place ghost appeared. There beyond lay white road, churchyard corner, tall grey tomb-stone glimmering moonlight. A steps more, slowly among yews came ghost before, raised long white arm. Bill determined that, he died it, he would he told; lifting his hand he pointed towards tomb-stone, gave shout. As he pointed, ghost turned round, then--rising behind tomb-stone, gliding slowly edge wall, separated churchyard lower level road--there appeared sight awful, Bill's shout merged prolonged scream terror. Truly Master Arthur's anticipations "scenic effect" amply realized. The walls buttresses old Church stood dark sky; white clouds sailed slowly moon, reflected damp grass, shone upon flat wet tomb-stones till looked like pieces water. It less bright upon upright ones, upon quaint crosses, short headstones, upon huge ungainly memorial murdered Ephraim Garnett. But _the_ sight shone night figure standing Ephraim Garnett's grave, looking wall. An awful figure, gigantic height, ghostly white garments clinging round headless body, carrying left arm head upon shoulders. On neither flesh hair. It seemed bare skull, fire gleaming hollow eye-sockets grinning teeth. The right hand figure outstretched warning; palms tips fingers mass lambent flame. When Bill saw fearful apparition he screamed hearty good will; noise he made nothing yell terror came beneath shroud Yew-lane Ghost, who, catching sight rival spectre, fled wildly lane, kicking white sheet he went, finally displaying, Bill's amazement, form features Bully Tom. But all. No sooner first ghost started, second (not behind-hand) jumped nimbly wall, gave chase. But fear put wings Bully Tom's feet; second ghost somewhat encumbered his costume, judged wisdom stop; taking fiery skull flaming hands, shied dexterity, hit Bully Tom middle his back, falling wet ground, went hiss. This blow unexpected shock Bully, thought ghost must come supernatural rapidity, falling his knees mud, began roar lustily: "Lord, mercy upon me! I will never more!" Mr. Lindsay likely alter his opinion subject bullies. This one, like others, mortal coward. Like men, fear GOD eyes, he made hearty fear sickness, death, departed souls, one two things, self-willed sinner knows well enough hands Power he cannot see, wish believe in. Bully Tom spoken truth he said he thought ghost Yew-lane he would not go near it. If he believed stories he alarmed poor Bill, lad's evening walk would never disturbed, far he concerned. Nothing his spite Bessy would made take much trouble vex peace, stop schooling, her pet brother; was, standing alone churchyard night position little his taste, he drunk pretty heavily public-house half hour beforehand, keep his spirits. And he paid back his coin, lay grovelling mud, calling profanely Lord, Whose mercy men always cry trouble, never ask sins. He confused blinded drink fright, he see second ghost divest his encumbrances, know John Gardener, till rosy-cheeked worthy, his clenched hands still flaming brimstone, danced round him, shouted scornfully, vehemence aspiration, he apt indulge excited: "Get hup, yer great cowardly booby, yer? So thought coming hout frighten little lad, ye? And met one hown size, ye? Now _will_ ye get hup take like man, shall I give ye lie there?" Bully Tom chose least two evils, staggering his feet oath, rushed upon John. But his present condition he match active little gardener, inspired wrath, thoughts Bessy; he received sound thrashing he known since he first arrogated character village bully. He roaring loudly mercy, John Gardener giving harmless roll mud way conclusion, he caught sight two young gentlemen lane--Master Arthur fits laughter absurd position ex-Yew-lane Ghost Mr. Lindsay standing still silent, folded arms, set lips, gold eye-glass his nose. As soon he saw them, he began shout, "Murder! help!" top his voice. "I see myself," said Master Arthur, driving his hands contemptuously his pockets--"I see helping great lout came frighten child, neither defend his eyes nose, take licking good grace he deserves it!" Bully Tom appealed Mr. Lindsay. "Yah! yah!" he howled: "will see man killed want help?" But clever young gentleman seemed even less inclined give his assistance. "Killed!" he said contemptuously; "I _have_ seen lad killed night this, piece bullying! Be thankful stopped time! I would not raise little finger save twice thrashing. It fairly earned! Give ghost his shroud, Gardener, let go; recommend haunt Yew-lane future." John so, words parting advice his account. "Be hoff you," he said. "Master Lindsay, he speaks like book. You are disgrace hage sect, are! I would soon fight old charwoman. Though, bless you, young gentlemen," he added, Bully Tom slunk muttering, "he _is_ biggest blackguard place; Rector'll say, he comes know you have mingled him, passes me." "He will forgive us, I dare say," said Master Arthur. "I wish he could seen emerge behind stone! It sight century! I wonder youngster thought it! Hi, Willie, here, Sir! What think second ghost?" Bill doubts light he ought regard apparition; he decided simple truth. "I thought looked horrid, Sir." "I hope did! The afternoon's work three able-bodied men marvellously wasted did not. However, I must say halloed loud enough!" Bill coloured, Mr. Lindsay looking hard top his spectacles. "Do not feel rather ashamed fright, you have seen ghosts without sheets?" inquired clever young gentleman. "Yes, Sir," said Bill, hanging his head. "I shall never believe ghosts again, Sir, though." Mr. Bartram Lindsay took his glasses, twiddled his fingers. "Well, well," he said low hurried voice; "I am parson, I do not pretend say believe should not. We know precious little much spirits dead see know left behind. But I think may venture assure poor soul passed waves troublesome world, whatever means, does not come back kicking white sheet dark lanes, frighten little boys going school." "And that is true, Sir," said John Gardener, admiringly. "So is," said Master Arthur. "I could not explained myself, Willie; sentiments I beg you will attend Mr. Lindsay told you." "Yes, Sir," said Bill. Mr. Lindsay laughed, though quite merrily, said-- "I could tell something more, Arthur, though he is young understand it: namely, he lives, day come, he would happy dead might come back hold hands us, anywhere, however short time." The young gentleman stopped abruptly; gardener heaved sympathetic sigh. "I tell is, Bartram," muttered Master Arthur, "I suppose I am young, too, I have quite enough melancholies one night. As you, you are old hills; it is time came home; I would known told night, old fellow, should not come expedition. Now, you, Willie," added young gentleman, whirling sharply round, "if you are pattern Solomon henceforth, will not fault friends. And wisdom does not bring school this, I shall try argument one-legged donkey." "I do not think I shall miss next time, Sir." "I hope will not. Now, John, you have come far, may well see lad safe home; do not shake hands family present state fists, might throw somebody fit. Good-night!" Yew-lane echoed round "Good-nights;" Bill gardener went high spirits. As crossed road, Bill looked round, trees saw young gentlemen strolling back Rectory, arm arm. Mr. Bartram Lindsay his chin high air, Master Arthur vehemently exhorting topic, he pointing moral flourishes one-legged donkey. * * * * * For like know "what became of" everybody, facts added: The young gentlemen got safely home; Master Arthur gave comical account adventure, Rector laughed much scold them, even he wished. Beauty Bill went Yew-lane many moonlight night one, he never saw another ghost, felt fears connection Ephraim Garnett. To make matters entirely comfortable, however, John kindly took custom walking home lad night-school ended. In return attention, Bill's family apt ask hour; fire-side he told story two ghosts often--from manufacture Rectory barn final apparition cross-roads--that whole family declare feel seen it. Bessy, hands cheerful doctor, got quite well, eventually married. As her cottage boasts finest window plants village, shrewdly surmised her husband gardener. Bully Tom talked loudly time "having law of" rival ghost; finding, perhaps, story redound his credit, unwilling give publicity, changed his mind. Winter summer, day night, sunshine moonlight, passed lane churchyard, wind many ghostly howl among yews, since poor Bill learnt story murder; he knows true Ephraim Garnett never seen cross-roads since hundred years ago, till Great Day. In ditch side Yew-lane shortly events I describing, little lad found large turnip, someone cut eyes, nose, mouth, put bits stick teeth. The turnip hollow, inside fixed bit wax candle. He lighted up, effect splendid, he made show his companions price marble each, well satisfied. And last Yew-lane Ghosts. A BAD HABIT. CHAPTER I. "Oh, much doth beauty beauteous seem By sweet ornament truth doth give! The rose looks fair, fairer deem For sweet odour doth live." SHAKESPEARE. My godmother, Lady Elizabeth, used say, "Most things matters habit. Good habits bad habits." And she generally added, "_Your_ bad habit, Selina, habit grumbling." I always accustomed seeing great respect paid anything godmother said did. In first place, she Mrs. Arthur James Johnson called "a fine lady," maids called "a real lady." She old friend and, I think, relative father, married little his rank--my mother daughter rich manufacturer. My father died I remember things, Joseph I lived mother her friends. At least, mother she could bear noise; rest time, tired playing games together, sat maids. "That learned little _toss_ trick grumbling, dear," godmother said, planting her gold eye-glasses her high nose; "and mouth growing shape, forehead getting puckered, chin poked, and--and boots bulged crooked." "_My boots_, godmother?" "Your boots, dear. No boots keep shape shake hips kick heels like servant Sunday walking. When little girls flounce high road, looks ridiculous; grow up, you will never clean petticoat, known well-bred woman behind back, unless learn walk legs feelings control. That sergeant coming to-morrow every week-day morning drill Joseph ten eleven whilst remain here." And godmother pressed leaves journal her lap, cut quite straight decisively heavy ivory paper-knife. I never taught bad manners mutter--nurse always talked herself she "put out"--and, I stood much awe Lady Elizabeth, I like complain aloud her arrangements. So I turned doll sharp flounce arms, muttered behind her tarlatan skirts "I think whole holidays visiting." I believe godmother heard me; she looked moment top her gold eye-glasses, went reading paper them. After moments, she laid her lap her left hand, her right hand took her eye-glasses held her fingers. "I shall sorry do not grow nice-looking, Selina," she said. "It is great advantage woman--indeed, anyone--to good-looking. Your mother pretty woman, too; father--" Lady Elizabeth stopped, then, seeming suddenly see I watching her waiting, put her glasses her eyes again, continued-- "Your father good-looking gentleman, fine face fine figure, beautiful eyes mouth, attractive hands, fascinating manners. It pity do not grow nice-looking." I grew crimson, partly mortification partly astonishment. I strong natural desire pretty, I felt sure I taught somehow much meritorious care it. It certainly please (if I offended them) maids said I never pretty Maud Mary Ibbetson, bosom friend; nurse took good looking-glass nursery, hung wavy one used her room instead, keep growing vain, I dispute her statement "the less little girls looked glass better." And I went see Maud Mary (who child rich parents, cheval-glass her bed-room), satisfaction feel she prettier, could see herself full length, she probably vainer I. It mortifying, therefore, find godmother thought plain, gave credit minding it. I grew redder redder, eyes filled tears. Lady Elizabeth nice one way--she treated us much courtesy consideration grown up. People think polite children, godmother polite. "My dear child," she said, holding her hand, "I sorry I hurt feelings. I beg pardon." I put hot rather dirty little paw among her cool fingers diamond rings. I could mutter her face, I said rather sobs "it seemed thing" blamed pretty. "My dear Selina, I never said anything pretty. I said I sorry grow nice-looking, quite another thing. It depend whether nice-looking not." I began feel comforted, I bridled chin aggrieved manner, I know I caught Mrs. Marsden, charwoman, she took tea nursery told long tales nurse; I said I "was sure was not want speaking to" nurse hair wave like Maud Mary's, I asked her crimp it, she said, "Handsome handsome does, ought enough you, Miss Selina, without _my_ slaving damp-plait hair every night." I repeated nurse's speech pretty volubly, her sharp accent accompanying toss. My godmother heard out, she said-- "Nurse quoted good proverb, even truer allowed be. Those well grow look well. My little goddaughter, soft child's face pinched pulled nice shape ugly shape, much pull pinch gutta-percha head I gave you, and, one way another, shaped along." "But people cannot give beautiful figures, eyes, mouths, hands, said papa had, unless born so," I objected. "Your father's figure, dear," said Lady Elizabeth, "was beautiful grace power comes training. He military man, look dozen common men marching regiment compare dozen class men go plodding work loafing play native villages, see people figures. His eyes, Selina, bright intelligence trained powers observation; beautiful kindliness, well-bred habit giving complete attention people affairs he talked them. He rare smile, may inherit, real beauty mouths his comes lips restrained firm sensitive lines, years self-control fine sympathies." I quite understand. "Do mean I practise mouth nice shape?" I asked. "Certainly not, dear, pinch nose shape finger thumb; lips, lines face, take shape themselves, according temper habits. "There two things," godmother continued, turning round look minute, "there two things, Selina, growing good-looking. One caught many little vulgarisms servants; little bad habit grumbling, which, matter, ill-bred habit well, would spoil prettiest eyes, nose, mouth, chin ever inherited. Under-bred ill-educated women are, general rule, much less good-looking well-bred highly-educated ones, especially middle life; good features pretty complexions belong one class another, nicer personal habits stricter discipline mind do. A girl never taught brush her teeth, breathe nostrils instead lips, chew back teeth instead front, poor chance growing pretty mouth, anyone may see observed middle-aged woman class munching meat pie railway-station. And if, bargain, she nothing talk her her neighbour's everyday affairs, nothing think keep her continually talking, life, dear child, full little rubs, constant chatter kind must almost certainly constant grumbling. And constant grumbling, Selina, makes ugly under-lip, forehead wrinkled frowning, dull eyes see nothing grievances. There book library pictures faces I must show you. Do draw all, dear?" "Mamma gave drawing-slate birthday," I replied, "but Joseph bothered lend him, he is broken glass. It _is_ tiresome! But it is always way lend things." "What makes think always way lend things?" godmother gently inquired. "It seems was, I am sure," answer. "It fish-kettle cook lent Browns. They kept fortnight, let rust, first time cook put drop water leaked; she said always _was_ way; might lend everything had, people conscience, came borrowing pepperpot--" My godmother put her long hands impatient gesture. "That do, dear. I do not care hear mother's cook said fish-kettle." I felt uncomfortable, glad Lady Elizabeth went talking. "Have Joseph collections? When I age, I remember I made nice collection wafers. They quite pretty modern monograms." "Joseph collected feathers pillows once," I said, laughing. "He got great many different sorts, nurse burned them, he cried." "I am sorry nurse burned them. I daresay made happy. I advise begin collection, Selina. It capital cure discontent. Anything do. A collection buttons, instance. There great many kinds; ever travelled friend crowns collection mandarin's button, one day least will not feel grievance worth speaking of." I feeling much aggrieved Lady Elizabeth spoke, thinking "it seemed hard scolded visiting, one got scrape." But I said "nobody home ever said I grumbled much;" I "did not know servants complained people's." "I suppose do," said godmother. "I told already I consider foible ill-educated people, whose interests limited, whose feelings disciplined. You know James, butler, Selina, not?" "Oh, yes, godmamma!" I knew James well. He kind me, always liberal when, Lady Elizabeth's orders, he helped almonds raisins dessert. "My mother died young," said Lady Elizabeth, "and sixteen I head father's household. I well trained, I tried duty. Amid details providing entertaining many people, duty think everything, never seem I anything mind. I fairly trained _for kitchen-maid_, Selina, I done I told bawled me, talked seemed overwhelmed work Prime Minister. Well, servants known babyhood, light matter needful authority without hurting feelings old faithful friends. But, whole, respected efforts, proud self-possession. I trouble younger ones, young help me, I young overawe. I busy one morning writing necessary letters, James--who seventeen, under-footman--came drawing room wished speak me. When he wasted good deal time describing his unwillingness disturb me, years his father lived father's service, I said, 'James, I important letters write, little time spare. If complaint make, kindly put shortly can?' 'I am sure, lady, I wish complain,' James's reply; thereon his complaints poured forth continuous stream. I took watch (unseen James, I never insult people), gave five minutes his grievances. He got pretty fast them. He mentioned stone floor his bed-room, draught pantry, overbearingness butler, potatoes servants' hall under-boiled cook temper, inferior quality new plate-powder, insinuations his father's honesty servants upstarts comparison, his hat spoilt rain, he never miserable his life--when five minutes expired, I said 'Then, James, want go?' He coloured, I really think tears stood his eyes. He good-hearted lad. "When he began say he could never regard place he looked this, he felt towards his lordship he could feel towards master mistress, I gave another five minutes he pleased with. To justice, list quite long his grievances. No people like us, he never happy his life. So I said, 'Then, James, want stay?' "James began fresh statement, his grievances his satisfactions came alternately, I cut short saying, 'Well, James, difficulty seems made mind want. I time balance matters you, better go downstairs think well over, let know decide.' "He went accordingly, he driven think stopped talking me, I suppose he wise enough perceive easier find crosses one's lot feel quite sure one could change better. I doubt he _not_ got he might lawfully wished for, but, different positions were, I, duty make best life found it. It is good thing, dear child, get habit saying oneself, 'One cannot everything.' I suppose James learned say it, he lived ever since." At moment Joseph called open window led garden-- "Oh, Selina! I sorry; I got shop I could not remember whether quarter yard ribbon three-quarters wanted doll's hat." Joseph always stupid things like this. It vexed much, I jumped hastily seized doll go speak him, saying, I so, "boys enough drive one wild, one might well ask poodle anything Joseph." And till I flounced drawing-room I felt rather hot uncomfortable remember I tossed head, knitted brows, jerked chin, pouted lips, shaken skirts, kicked heels, I so, godmother probably observing her gold eye-glasses. CHAPTER II. "It easier prevent ill habits break them."--OLD PROVERB. I must say Joseph _was_ rather stupid boy. He year younger me, I never could make understand exactly I wanted played together; he always saying, "Oh, I say, look here, Selina!" proposing silly plan his own. But he good-natured, alone I let uncle dolls. When spent day Maud Mary, however, never let play baby-house; allowed postman baker, people sort, knock ring, sent messages. During first week visit Lady Elizabeth, weather fine Joseph I played day long garden. Then became rainy, quarrelled old swing imperfect backgammon board lumber-room, allowed amuse ourselves. But one morning went play-room, drilling Sergeant Walker, Joseph found model fortress wooden soldiers cannon one corner room; I found Dutch market, kinds wooden booths, little tables tea another. They presents godmother; far best kind toys ever had, could many things them. Joseph happy his soldiers he never came near Dutch fair; times he always bothering allowed play dolls. At first I glad, I afraid he would coming saying, "Oh, I say, Selina," suggesting things; I wanted arrange shops way. But done, I taking dolls one booth another shop, I think seemed odd Joseph even want walk fair. And I gave leave shopkeeper, stand front booth turn, he seem anxious come; he would bring cannon him, hide behind his back I came buy vegetables dolls' dinners. We quarrelled cannon. I said one ever heard greengrocer cannon his shop; Joseph said could not matter greengrocer stood front cannon hide it. So I said I would not cannon fair all; Joseph said he did not want come fair, he liked his fortress much better, he rattled out, dragging his cannon behind him, knocked Adelaide Augusta, gutta-percha doll, leaning fishmonger's slab, her chin salmon. It hard, I said so; Joseph said plenty times I would not let play dolls; I said it--when I did not want he wanted, I wanted he would not, he selfish. So last he put away his cannon, came played shops; he stupid, would look his shoulder fortress he ought pretending sell; once, I left fair, he got his cannon back shot peas it, fowls fell real hooks poulterer's shop, said he bombarding city. I angry, said, "I shall go straight down, complain godmamma," I went. The worst morning Lady Elizabeth said me, "Remember one thing, dear. I listen complaints whatever. No grumbles either Joseph. If want anything got, ask it, I best you, little guests; right reasonable, fair both, shall want. But must know mind ask, make best I you. I hear general complaints whatever." Remembering this, I felt little nervous I fairly drawing-room, Lady Elizabeth laid her glasses hear I say. "Do want anything, dear?" said she. I began complain--that Joseph stupid; seemed provoking; I think unkind him, etc.; Lady Elizabeth put her hand. "My dear Selina, forgotten I told you. If anything old woman like make father's child happy, afraid ask it, I grumbling drawing-room. By means make mind want, do not afraid ask old godmother. But she thinks right refuse, think right ask, must make best matters stand, keep good humour good manners like lady." I felt puzzled. When I complained nurse Joseph "was tiresome," she grumbled back "she never knew children," forth. It always easy meet grievance grievance, I found easy make mind pluck courage ask many words I wanted. "Shall I ask Joseph put away his cannon come play game hour now, dear? I certainly forbid fire shop." This quite satisfy me. As matter fact, Joseph left his fortress play me; I really think he would discharge his cannon poulterer's again. But I thought hardly used, I wanted godmother think too, scold Joseph. What else I wanted, I feel quite sure. "I wish would speak Joseph," I said. "He would attend told selfish stupid he is." "My dear, I never offered complain Joseph, I order molest you, I ask play you." "I am sure I do not want play me, unless he play nicely, invent things dolls say, Maud Mary would," reply; I getting thoroughly vexed. "Then I tell unless he play game wish it, he better amuse his toys. Is anything else want, dear?" I could speak, I crying, I sobbed "I missed Maud Mary so." "Who Maud Mary, Selina?" "Maud Mary Ibbetson, particular friend--my _very_ particular friend," I explained. I spoke warmly, moment memory Maud Mary seemed adorable, I longed pour complaints her sympathetic ear. Besides, I another reason regretting she me. When together, she, rule, new handsome toys exhibit, whilst I played humbler part admirer. But she me, then, would triumph displaying Dutch fair! The longer I thought her faster tears fell, help think anything definite ask for; Lady Elizabeth said, "would like go home, dear? want ask friend stay you?" I grace feel ashamed peevishness, thank godmother her kindness, protest wanting anything more. I added, amid subsiding sobs, "it seem thing," I got Dutch fair play dolls in, Joseph stupid, dear Maud Mary, would enjoyed much, able see it. CHAPTER III. "Nous aurons aussi la fête dans notre rue."--RUSSIAN PROVERB. Next day, drill long corridor over, Lady Elizabeth told Joseph bring his fortress, guns, soldiers library, play Thirty Years' War bay-window large book pictures sieges battles, she lent him. To godmother turned kindly said, "I invited little friend Maud come stay week. I hope she arrive to-day, better prepare dolls shops company." Maud Mary coming! I danced joy, kissed godmother, expressed delight again. I liked talk Joseph, he plunged Thirty Years' War, attention give me. It custom neighbourhood mother lived call people double Christian names, John Thomas, William Edward, forth; godmother never called Maud Mary anything Maud. It possible darling friend might arrive twelve of the clock train, carriage sent meet her, whilst I danced big hall impatience. When came back without her disappointment knew bounds. I felt sure Ibbetsons' coachman unpunctual, dear Maud Mary's nurse cross, usual, tried get her things packed. I rushed library full forebodings, godmother said, "No grumbling, dear!" Joseph called out, "Oh, I say, Selina, I wish would not swing doors so: you have knocked Wallenstein, he is fallen top Gustavus Adolphus;" I compose best I could till five of the clock train. Then she came. Darling Maud Mary! Perhaps I crushed her new feather kissing her (and Maud Mary particular her clothes); perhaps she tired travelling, I forgot; perhaps she would rather tea first, Maud Mary quite nice Dutch fair I liked her be. She said she rather wondered Lady Elizabeth given big dolls' house like instead; she come away hurry she forgot lock up, she least surprised kitten got broke something, "it seem rather odd" invited hurried way; she _was_ going big house pay grand visit, course dressmaker "disappointed" Mrs. Ibbetson, "that way things always happen;" last time Mr. Ibbetson Paris he offered bring her dolls' railway train, real first-class carriages really stuffed, she said she would rather locket, one hanging round her neck, much handsomer Lucy Jane Smith's, cost five pounds London. Maud Mary's inattention fair dolls obvious I followed godmother's advice, "made best it" saying, "I am afraid you are much tired, darling?" Maud Mary tossed her chin frowned. It "enough tire anybody," she said, travel particular line. The railway her papa director differently managed. I think godmother's courtesy us, her thoughtful kindness, fixed her repeated hints self-control good manners rather firmly head. I distinctly remember making effort forget toys think Maud Mary's comfort. I said, "Will come take things, darling?" she said, "Yes, darling;" tea. But next day, she quite rested, really nothing complain of, I think she might praised Dutch fair. She said "seemed funny thing" play old garret; she need wanted alter arrangement shops, everything her way, she always home, because, her dolls' house hers, Dutch fair mine. I think, moment, getting godmother speak her, I knew would use complain unless I something ask for. When I came think it, I found I wanted Maud Mary let manage toys direct game, I resolved ask her myself. "Look here, darling," said I, "when I come play you, I always play dolls like, dolls' house yours; I wish would play game to-day, Dutch fair mine." Maud Mary flounced her feet, bridled her wavy head, said she sure she want play I did not like her way playing; Dutch fair, her papa could buy her one day her own. I nettled, Maud Mary little apt flourish Mr. Ibbetson's money face; her father rich, godmother lady rank, I said "my godmother, Lady Elizabeth, said vulgar flounce toss one's head one put out." Maud Mary crimsoned, and, exclaiming she care Lady Elizabeth Lady Anybody Else said, she whisked three shops ends her sash, kicked wax Josephine Esmeralda's nose heel her Balmoral boot. I do not like confessing it, I push Maud Mary, Maud Mary slapped me. And looked up, godmother standing us, her gold spectacles her nose. * * * * * Lady Elizabeth kind, even I knew she right. When she said, "I asked friend week, week, dear, she guest, must try please, _make best it_," I dispute it; I felt spirit self-suppression hospitable pride awake within she said. I think hardest part that, whatever I whatever I gave up, Maud Mary recognized effort part. What she got she took her due, she get she grumbled about. I sometimes think partly because, long week, she never ceased grumbling, I did; I hope life. Only I said, "O godmamma! glad I shall I alone Joseph again!" And sudden remorse, I added, "But I beg pardon, that is grumbling; _have_ kind!" Lady Elizabeth took her eye-glasses, held her hands mine. "Is grumbling, little woman?" she said. "Well, I am sure." "_I'm_ sure," I said, smiling; "for know I said I _glad_ alone Joseph, try good him; he kind boy, he little awkward dolls, I mean make best it. _One cannot everything_," I added, laughing. Lady Elizabeth drew head towards her, stroked kissed it. "GOD bless you, child," she said. "You _have_ inherited father's smile." * * * * * "But, I say, Selina," whispered Joseph, I went look his fortress bay-window. "Do suppose it is he is dead she cried behind her spectacles she said got his smile?" A HAPPY FAMILY. CHAPTER I. "If solid happiness prize, Within breast jewel lies. * * * * * From selves joys must flow, And peace begins home." COTTON. The family--our family, Happy Family--consisted brothers sisters. I father mother, course. I eldest, I remind brothers; worthy gender, sisters sometimes forget. Though live village, father gentleman, I shall I grown up. I told village boys once. One feels mean boasting one better born are; I tell them, I sure would always know. Our house old, ghost--the ghost great-great-great-great-great-aunt. She "crossed her father's will," nurse says, he threatened flog her his dog-whip, she ran away, never heard more. He would let pond dragged, he never went near again; villagers like go near now. They say may meet her there, sunset, flying along path among trees, her hair half down, knot ribbon fluttering it, parted lips, terror her eyes. The men family (my father's family, mother Irish) always strong wills. I strong myself. People say I like picture great-grandfather (the great-great-great-nephew ghost). He must wonderful old gentleman accounts. Sometimes nurse says us, "Have way, you will live longer," always makes think great-grandfather, much his way, lived nearly hundred. I remember father telling us his sisters visit old granny months time, he shut shutters three of the clock summer afternoons, made play dummy whist candle light. "Did not brothers go?" asked Uncle Patrick, across dinner-table. My father laughed. "Not we! My mother got us once--but never again." "And sisters like it?" "Like it? They used cry hearts out. I really believe killed poor Jane. She consumptive chilly, always craving fresh air; granny never would open windows, fear draughts his bald head; yet girls fires room, young people should not pampered." "And ye never-r offer-r-ed--neither ye--to go stead them?" When Uncle Patrick rolls his R's discussion, mother becomes nervous. "One cannot expect boys consider things," she said. "Boys boys, know." "And would  them be?" said father. Uncle Patrick turned mother. "Too true, Geraldine. Ye do not expect it. Worse luck! I assure ye, I would aghast brutes men be, I was not amazed we are good are, best gentlest sex--the moulders childhood, desire manhood--demand little alone give. There conceivable uses women preferring biggest brutes barbarous times, it is now; boys civilised boys, men civilised men, sweet sister, _do_ expect it, grace favours rewards nobleness, easy prize selfishness savagery." My father spoke fairly. "There is truth say, Pat." "And small grace saying it. Forgive me, John." That is way Uncle Patrick flares cools down, like straw bonfire. But father makes allowances him; first, he Irishman, and, secondly, he is cripple. * * * * * I love mother dearly, I anything I like her. I always could. When I baby, I would go sleep unless she walked me, (though walking bad her) I got way, afterwards. With one exception. She would never tell godfather. I asked once, she distressed I glad promise never speak again. But I thought more, though I knew his portrait--such fine fellow--and he swaggering, ridiculous name mine. How father allowed christened Bayard I cannot imagine. But I rather proud one time--in days I wore long curls, accustomed hearing called "a perfect picture," little sayings quoted mother her friends, made miserable grown-up people took liberty attending anything me. I remember wriggling mother's knee I wanted change, she gave her watch keep quiet, stroked curls, called her fair-haired knight, her little Bayard; though, remembering also, lingeringly I used her bidding, ate sugar she was not looking, tried bawl fits, kicked nurse-girl's shins, dared go upstairs dark--I must confess young chimpanzee would good claims I represent model self-conquest true chivalry, "the Knight without fear without reproach." However, vanity last long. I wonder grand-faced godfather mine suffered I suffered he went school said his name Bayard? I owe day harvest young wag turned Backyard. I gave name Backyard every subsequent inquirer, Backyard I modestly remained. CHAPTER II. "The lady gay macaw." LONGFELLOW. My sisters much like fellows' sisters, excepting Lettice. That child like one herself. I used tease girls fun, I teased Lettice principle--to knock nonsense her. She eight, small, but, top row her tight little curls rosettes her best shoes, she seemed mass affectation. Strangers always liked Lettice. I believe she born company voice her mouth; she would flit like butterfly one grown-up person another, chit-chattering, whilst us stood pounding knuckles pockets, tying legs knots, wished drawing-room carpet would open let us cellar play catacombs. That Cocky came. Lettice's airs graces bewitched old lady called yellow chariot, like cockatoo herself--a cockatoo citron velvet bonnet, bird Paradise feather. When old lady put her eye-glass, she would frightened yard-dog; Lettice stood tip-toes stroked feather, saying, "What love-e-ly bird!" And next day came Cocky--perch complete--_for little girl loves birds_. Lettice proud Cocky, Edward really loved him, took trouble him. Edward good boy. My mother called Black Prince. He I disgraced eyes Cockatoo lady, cost family thirty thousand pounds, ill afford lose. It unlucky she came luncheon day Edward I settled dress Early Britons, blue woad, dine earth-nuts shrubbery. As slipped side door, yellow chariot drove front. We doormats on, well powder-blue, old lady terribly shocked, drove straight away, return. Nurse says she father's godmother, thirty thousand pounds, she would bequeathed us offended her. I take blame entirely, I always made others play I pleased. We used play kinds things--concerts, circuses, theatricals, sometimes conjuring. Uncle Patrick see us long time, one day heard he coming, I made mind I would perfectly new entertainment him. We like entertainments Uncle Patrick, he good audience. He laughs, cries, claps, thumps his crutch, things go badly, he amuses rest. Ever since I remember anything, I remember old print, called "The Happy Family," nursery fire-place, I used wonder immovable cat, sparrows her back, sitting owl magpie. And I saw Edward sitting Benjamin cat, two sparrows he brought hand, struggling laughing Cocky would push itself, crest first, his waistcoat, come top kiss him--that idea struck me; I resolved Happy Family Uncle Patrick, act Showman myself. Edward anything beasts. He absolutely necessary confederate, possible Lettice might want show Cocky, I want girl stage, I said little her. But I told Edward yard-dog, practise happy rest family pets. Fred, farm-boy, promised look owl. Benjamin, cat, could got mice enough; he would eaten Edward time teach better, I set trap. I knew village-boy magpie, ready tamed. Bernard, yard-dog, lumbering old fellow, tricks. We tried. We took once, snow-drift, lantern round his neck, he rescued nothing, lost lantern--and he lost himself, dark. But he handsome good, I knew, I put middle, he would let anything sit upon him. He would feel it, mind he did. He takes notice Cocky. Benjamin never quarrels Cocky, he dare forget Cocky there. And Cocky sometimes looks Benjamin's yellow eyes thinking easily would come out. But quite sufficiently happy together Happy Family. The mice gave trouble rest, I settled Lettice wind mechanical mouse, run curtain rose. CHAPTER III. "Memor esto majorum." OLD MOTTO. " . . . . All fears laid aside, If I remember Such lived died!" LONGFELLOW. Do wish avoid vexations? Then never Happy Family! Mine countless. Fred could get owl. Lettice _did_ want show Cocky. I way, she looked sulky spiteful. I got Tom Smith's magpie; I him, too. However, costume Showman gorgeous, Edward kept Happy Family well together. We arranged Tom put Mag left wing, run round behind, call Mag softly right. Then she would hop across stage him, show well. Lettice let mother know spectators might take places, tell gardener raise curtain. I really think one magpie must "a sign sorrow," nurse says; made Bernard take his beautiful foolish head give trouble I cannot imagine. He would not lie down, he did, _grump_ protest seemed forbode failure. However, he let Cocky scold pull his hair, safety-valve Cocky. Benjamin dozed dignity. He knew Cocky was not watching his yellow eyes. I do not think Lettice meant mischief she summoned spectators, time up. But her warning curtain rise simple malice revenge. I never forget catastrophe, I clearly remember Tom Smith I _began_ quarrel. He excessively impudent, seemed think could not Happy Family without his chattering senseless magpie. When I told remember he speaking gentleman, he grinned me. "A gentleman? Nay, sakes! Ye're civil enough half. More like new policeman, ye were not Guy Fawkes finery." "Be off," said I, "and take bird you." "What I will not go?" "I will make you!" "Ye darsen't touch me." "Dare not I?" "Ye darsen't." "I dare." "Try." "_Are_ going?" "Noa." I pushed him. He struck first. He is bigger me, he is bigger coward, I would got middle stage, given something bawl about, I became conscious curtain up. I realised then, civil, stupid Fred, arrived left wing, panting gasping-- "Measter Bayard! Here is young wood-owl ye." As he spoke, escaped him, fluff feathers flying effort, squawking, plunging, fluttering, made wildly darkest corner stage, Lettice ran mechanical mouse front. Bernard rose, shook everything, Cocky went screaming hysterics; I heard thud Uncle Patrick's crutch, peals upon peals laughter audience greeted long-planned spectacle Happy Family! * * * * * Our Irish uncle always nice. He teases mocks, uncertain temper. But one goes trouble. I went next morning pour woes, defend myself, complain others. I spoke seriously Lettice. It pleasant fellow sister grows peculiar, I believe Lettice will. Only Sunday before, I told her she would sort woman men hate, she said she did not care; I said she ought to, women made men, Bible says so; she said grandmamma said every soul made GOD final good. She high-falutin mood, said she wished she christened Joan instead Lettice, I would true Bayard; could ride world together, dressed armour, fighting right. And she would say list her favourite heroines, asked I minded _their_ peculiar, I said course not, mind women do not belong you? So she said she could see that; I said girls cannot see reason; quarrelled, I gave her regular lecture, I repeated Uncle Patrick. He listened quite quietly till mother came in, got fidgetty, told argue uncle. Then he said-- "Ah! let boy talk, Geraldine, let hear he say himself. There is sublime audacity his notions, I tell ye. Upon conscience, I believe he thinks his grandmother created his particular convenience." That is he mocks, I suppose he meant Irish grandmother. He thinks there is nobody like her wide world, father says she handsomest wittiest old lady British Isles. But I mind. I said, "Well, Uncle Patrick, you are man, I believe agree me, though mock me." "Agree ye?" He started up, pegged room. "Faith! life live like globe inhabit--if revolves axis, _and you are axis_--there is flaw philosophy; IF--Now perish impetuosity! I have frightened dear mother away. May I ask, bye, _she_ good fortune please ye, since Maker souls made her, eternity, particular object mothering brief patch time?" He stopped portrait--my godfather's portrait. All his Irish rhodomontade went straight head, I ran him. "Uncle, know I adore her! But there is one thing she will not do, and, oh, I wish would! It is years since she told never ask, I have honour, I have never even asked nurse; I do not think it is wrong ask you. Who man behind you, looks wonderfully fine fellow? My Godfather Bayard." I experienced shock night before, nothing shock seeing Uncle Patrick's face then, hearing sob his words, instead flowing like stream. "Is possible? Ye do not know? She cannot speak yet? Poor Geraldine!" He controlled himself, turned picture, leaning his crutch. I stood gazed too, I think, save life, I could helped asking-- "Who he?" "Your uncle. Our brother. Oh, Bayard, Bayard!" "Is he dead?" He nodded, speechless; somehow I could forbear. "What he die of?" "Of unselfishness. He died--for others." "Then he _was_ hero? That is he looks like. I glad he godfather. Dear Uncle Pat, tell it." "Not now--hereafter. Nephew, man--with heart man mouse--is likely behave well pinch; man habitually selfish _sure_ he will, choice comes sharp his life lives others. The impulse supreme moment focusses habits customs man's soul. The supreme moment may never come, habits customs mould us cradle grave. His early disciplined dear mother, he bettered her teaching. Strong weak, wise foolish--tender hard--gracious surly--good evil. Oh, brother, without fear without reproach! Speak across grave, tell sister's son vice cowardice become alike impossible man never--cradled selfishness, made callous custom--learned pamper expense others!" I waited little I asked-- "Were he died?" "I was." "Poor Uncle Patrick! What _did_ do?" He pegged away sofa, threw it. "Played fool. Broke arm thigh, damaged spine, and--_lived_. Here rest mortal remains." And next ten minutes, he mocked himself, he can. * * * * * One like outdone uncle, even uncle; easy learn live like Godfather Bayard. Sometimes I wish grandmother brought her sons high pitch, sometimes I wish mother let unlucky name become extinct family, I might adopt nickname. One could live _Backyard_ easily enough. It seems suit grumpy tyrannical, seeing one's nose, well. But I try learn unselfishness; though I sometimes think would quite easy owl learn respect independence mouse, cat forbearing sparrow! I certainly get better others I used do; I hopes even father's godmother finally estranged fault. Uncle Patrick went call her whilst he us. She fond "that amusing Irishman crutch," she calls him; father says he will swear Uncle Patrick entertained her mightily unlucky entertainment, she pleased Punch her cockatoo thick it. I afraid true; idea made hot, I known she really coming call us again, I certainly kept way. But Uncle Patrick said, "If yellow chariot rolls way again, Bayard, ye need pursuing archæological revivals early English costume," I thought his chaff. But she come. I pegging new gardens little ones. We there, she turned her eye us (just like cockatoo), said, company voice-- "What happy little family!" I could hardly keep countenance, I heard Edward choking Benjamin's fur, he hidden his face. But Lettice never moved muscle. She clasped her hands, put her head one side, said--in _her_ company voice--"But know brother Bayard _is_ good us now, _that_ A HAPPY FAMILY."
