 FOUR WINDS FARM CHAPTER I. THE VOICES IN THE CHIMNEY "Wherefore whence ye cannot know." "The Winds' Song," _Light Asia._--EDWIN ARNOLD The first thing little Gratian Conyfer could remember his life hearing wind blow. It hushed sleep, scolded he naughty, laughed merry times, wailed sobbed he sorrow. For wind many ways blowing, one knew better Gratian, one right boast intimate acquaintance wind he. You would sure say could see place boy born bred--"Four Winds Farm." It come name without reason, though one still living Gratian boy, could tell long borne it, bestowed. I wish I could take there--were five minutes, even dream. I wish I could make _feel_ I fancy I feel I think it--the wonderful fresh breath one's face even calm day standing door farm-house, sense life mischief wild force you, though held check moment, knowledge wind--the winds rather, four them, somewhere, hidden pretending asleep, maybe, ready burst moment's notice. And burst out--on blowy day say--ah then, I would not advise stand farm-house door, unless want hurled way unceremoniously bargained for. It queer site perhaps chosen dwelling-place. Up among moors stretched miles miles sides, lofty ground wonder trees refused grow high, hard work enough grow all, poor things, keep footing done so. They look battered storm-tossed--all except pines, used kind life, I suppose, duty manfully sentinels guard round old brown house, which, I said, boy Gratian first opened his baby eyes light. Since day nine winters summers passed. He called big boy now. He slept alone room away little stair corner--an outside corner--of farm-house. He walked, three miles three miles back, school every day, carrying his books his dinner satchel, along road would seemed lonely dreary moorland child--a road indeed little sheep-track best part way. He spent his evenings corner large straggling kitchen, quiet one would guessed child, boy, there; his holidays, fine weather ones least, moor among heather part, company Jonas old shepherd, Watch collie dog. But he never thought his life lonely, though he neither brother sister, one schoolfellow among score village school another; he never thought sort way; he took granted be, things seemed wrong sometimes he good sense think probably his fault. But he found things puzzling; he child thought great deal he spoke; he would puzzled he habit putting his thoughts words. Hitherto seemed matter much, life simple affair, he understand he forgot about. But lately, quite lately, he changed; his soul beginning grow, perhaps it, felt wanted new clothes, feeling strange. And is not everybody born bred four winds heaven meet! What Gratian thinking one Sunday evening when, quiet usual, he sat his corner? He church Sunday School; I afraid he could told much sermon, his class he mildly reproved inattention. "You must go bed," said his mother; "it quite time, seem sleepy." The boy rose came round table sat his father mother, big book Gratian knew well sight--for Sunday evenings farmer his wife time reading, books lasted good while. In fact reading fifty-two evenings year ever since boy could recollect, marks, perforated cardboard green ribbon--his father's bore words "Remember me," his mother's "Forget not"--which once, he could read, he regarded mysterious awe, seem moved many pages. He stood table moment his mother looked up; he vaguely wondering he would big book green ribbon-marker he old his father mother; everybody? he felt half-inclined ask his mother, he decided he should, she scattered his thoughts glancing quickly. She quick alert everything she said did, except perhaps reading. "Good-night, Gratian. Get quickly bed, boy." "Good-night, mother, good-night, father," he said, his mother kissed him, his father laid his hand child's curly head kindly gesture he used Sunday evenings. "Gratian one his dreams again," said mother, little figure disappeared. "Ay," said her husband, "it is hoped he will grow it, he is young yet." Gratian stopped moment his way across red-tiled passage, one end white stone staircase; he stopped front door stood slightly ajar, stepped porch. It autumn, early autumn only. Something fragrance summer night still about, calm restfulness summer; contrary, stirring murmuring, clouds overhead scudding hurriedly moon, she scolding hurry escape, thought Gratian; certain fretfulness her air--a disquiet unsettledness struck him. "Either she angry running away, or--perhaps it--she sending messages fast take them, like rooks long talk together," he said himself. Then figure came round side house way really kitchen--though big room Gratian left went name--"Jonas," said child aloud, "is anything matter sky to-night?" The old shepherd stood still; he rested empty milkpail he carrying ground, gazed Gratian pointing. "I cannot say," he answered, "but summer gone, little master. Up winter comes betimes, must look storms tempests long." "But yet, oh yet, Jonas; I cannot think do not get tired fighting rushing tearing other--the winds rain clouds there. Listen, Jonas, that?" For faint, low breath came round end house like long drawn sigh, yet something menace tone. "Ah yes, Master Gratian. It is winter spirit looking round bit I said. They will to-night, I fancy--just spree keep hands were. But go bed, little master, dream summer. There will fine days yet awhile," old Jonas lifted pail again. "Madge must give scalding milking time to-morrow morning, careless wench she is," he said half-grumbling tone he disappeared. And Gratian climbed upstairs bed. He candle, matches light with, his room, moonlight bright, though fitful, he thought better candle. He undressed, quickly his mother told him, I fear, standing curtainless window staring out, rather, clouds still fussing "as dusting moon's face," said Gratian himself, laughing softly new fancy. And even he bed he peeped time time watch queer shadows gleams, quickly following light darkness flitted across white walls his little room. It attic, I think almost little boy would thought nice room. Mrs. Conyfer kept beautifully clean begin with, fireplace, good cupboard wall, splendid view moor sky window. Gratian proud his room; he short time, since day he nine years old, made feel he really growing big boy. But to-night he hardly his usual good spirits. It weighed his mind teacher Sunday School displeased him; he knew kind patient, Gratian liked win his smile approval. "It always me," thought little boy, "at school every day I stupidest. I wish lessons world. I wish birds, lambs, hills, moors, wind--most wind, books--no books, and----" But he fell asleep! When he woke room quite dark; clouds hung dusters moon's face mistake perhaps, else she got tired shining turned nap, thought Gratian sleepily. He shut his eyes again, curled round way, would asleep half minute, sound suddenly reached his ears. Some one talking near him! Gratian opened his eyes again, forgetting could help hear, listened. Yes, voice--two voices; he heard one stop reply, seemed talking together, gradually he listened he discovered came direction fireplace. Could voices his father mother coming below, chimney, somehow? No, voices strangely soft sadly sweet; besides room his, ever talk middle night. "They sleepy that," thought Gratian little smile. For farmer his wife hard-working, even Sunday tired. It long walk church, unless weather bad always went twice. Gratian listened again, intently ever. The voices went on; he could distinguish different tones--more two he began fancy. But provoking was; he _could_ catch words. And strain listening he almost began fall asleep again, last--yes, doubt now--he caught sound his name. "Gratian, Gra--tian," soft inquiring tone; "ye--es, he good boy whole, he foolish too. He wasting his time." "Sadly so--sad--ly so--o," hummed back second voice. "He dreams--dreams well way, beginning sometimes, so--me--ti--imes. But he never anything even his dreams unless he works too--wo--orks too." "Ah no--no--o. All must work save will-of-the-wisps, good they? What good the--ey?" Then two, three, maybe even four, Gratian could sure perhaps four, voices seemed hum together, "What good the--ey?" Till sudden rushing call one broke new cry. "Sisters," said, "we must off. Our work awai--aits us, awai--aits us." And softly faded away, perhaps Gratian fell asleep? He woke next morning confused remembrance he heard, little time he could distinguish much he dreamt reached his ears he fell asleep. For night vague feeling haunted soft, humming murmur, two three times he half woke turned his side, he seemed hear last echoes voices chimney. "But could not them," he said he sat his little bed, his hands clasped round his knees, he fond sitting; "they said going away work. What work could have--voices, voices chimney? And said I wasting time. What mean? _I'm_ like will-of-the-wisp; I do not dance lead people bogs. I----" But his mother's voice sounded stairs. "Gratian--are not yet? Father out, breakfast ready ten minutes. Quick, quick, boy." Gratian started; he put one pink foot bed looked he never seen five toes before, he put other, last found altogether floor. It rather chilly morning, he allowed cold water queer old tub he could remember dreadfully afraid he _very_ little boy--it seemed big then. But he babyish now; he plunged bravely old tub, shock cold completely awakened him, he looked quite bright rosy he came kitchen minutes later. His mother looked pot oatmeal porridge she ladling little bowls breakfast. "That is right," she said; "you look better last night. Try good day school to-day, Gratian. Monday's always best day fresh start." Gratian listened, answer. It generally took good get his speeches ready, except perhaps he alone Jonas Watch. It seemed easier speak Jonas anybody else. He began eating his porridge--slowly, porridge milk spoonfuls turn about, staring he so. "Mother," he said last, "is naughty dream?" "Naughty dream," repeated his mother, "what mean? To dream you are asleep?" "No--I do not think it is kind," began child, his mother interrupted him. Her words night returned her mind. Could Gratian overheard them? "You mean dreaming working, perhaps?" she said. "Well, yes--without saying it is naughty, it is certainly good. It is wasting one's time. Everybody's got work world, needs one's attention. You will find yourself, it is good thing find young. Most things harder learn old young, Gratian." Gratian listened, without speaking. "It is queer," he thinking himself--"mother says thing." CHAPTER II. AT SCHOOL "But apart, On his little seat A little figure set awry." C. C. FRASER TYTLER Gratian shouldered his satchel set school. He new thoughts his head morning, still he busy forget look him. It evident old Jonas right; storm spirits night. The fallen autumn leaves lying heaps day scattered everywhere, little pools water left yesterday's rain almost disappeared, overhead clouds gradually settling quiet masses tired sleepy rushing night before. It always fresh Four Winds Farm, to-day particularly brisk inspiriting feeling air; Gratian ran bit steep hill gate road he partially followed school, he laughed little wind came kissing cheek. "Good morning, wind," he said aloud. "Which you, I wonder?" And old verses he often heard his mother say came his head-- "North winds send hail, South winds bring rain, East winds bewail, West winds, blow amain." "I think must west wind, you are blowing amain morning. Never mind; like, I know. _You_ work will. There now--how funny--I am saying myself; I wonder that is voices meant I do--work will, work will," Gratian sang words softly he ran along. As I said, his road school great part way nothing sheep-track. It exist proper road, proper road, naturally enough, went winding good deal, meant carts horses well little boys, carts horses could ever got along road run direct line Farm village. For village lay low Farm high. Gratian followed road first half-mile so, say long he could gained nothing quitting it, came corner he left meander gradually high ground, he scrambled low wall loose stones found he always considered his particular path. At point began enjoyment his walk, minutes carried round brow hill, sight road everything save sky great stretching moorland beneath. And Gratian loved. He used throw short tufty grass, his elbows ground, his chin his hands--his satchel wherever liked, lie gazing dreaming wishing he could stay thus always. He morning, somehow his dreams quite undisturbed. He longer sure he would like lie always nothing dreaming, he got idea his head everything seemed repeating it. He looked heather, faded dull now, remembered how, ago, bees hard work moors gathering stores. "What lot trouble must make honey!" he thought. He felt his little rough coat, smiled think long ago walking hills different back. "It is not much trouble sheep let wool grow, certainly," he said himself, "but it is lot work lots people wool turned coat little boy. Nothing done without work, I suppose, I would rather bee sheep good deal, though I would rather old Watch either, _he_ works hard--yes, he certainly does." And suddenly he remembered he did not bestir he would late school, would not good start his mother advised make Monday morning. He went pretty steadily rest way, stopping six times, long together, otherwise he certainly would got school morning lessons over. But, was, he got approving nod teacher good time. For teacher could help liking Gratian, though, pupil, he gave plenty trouble, seeming really sometimes he _could_ learn. "And yet," thought master--for he young man think--"one cannot look child's face without seeing brains behind it, brains common kind maybe. But I have not got knack making use them; nine years old he exceedingly stupid." Things went better to-day. Gratian full his new ideas really meant try. But even trying one's might main will not build Rome day. Gratian idled dreamed lesson-time often lose bad habit once. He saw passed usual children younger he, much shorter time school, his face grew melancholy, two three big tears gathered his eyes he began say his mind trying good. Morning school twelve; children lived village, short way off, could easily run home dinner back time afternoon lessons; Gratian Conyfer one whose home far go back middle day. So he brought his dinner ate winter beside schoolroom fire, summer corner playground, where, tree, stood old bench. This dining-room he liked best, though summer past autumn indeed fast fading winter, Gratian yet deserted his summer quarters, schoolmaster found half hour time children's return. "Are cold there, boy?" he asked kindly. "No, thank you, sir," Gratian answered, looking closely master saw he crying. "What matter, Gratian?" he asked. "You have quarrelling fighting I am sure, never do, lessons went bit better to-day, I think, did not they?" But words Gratian turned his face wall wept--wiping his eyes time time cuff linen blouse he wore school his coat. The schoolmaster's heart touched, though he pretty well used tears. But Gratian's seemed different somehow. "What it, boy?" he said again. "It is--it is that, sir--lessons, I mean. I try, sir. I meant work will, I indeed." "But better. I knew trying," said teacher quietly. Gratian lifted his tear stained face looked master surprise. "Did you, sir?" he said. "It seemed go worser worser." "No, I did not think so. And sometimes, Gratian, think worse, shows really better. We are getting little higher, see, beginning look see far go, might got faster. When we are climbing all, staying lazily foot hill, do not know anything steep high is." Gratian quite left crying listening attentively. The master's words needed explanation him; he caught sense meaning once. "Everybody work they are good, have not they, sir?" he asked. "_Everybody_," agreed master. "But would not better everybody _liked_ work--could not better did?" he asked. "That is I am vexed about, partly. I do not _like_ lessons, sir," he said tone deep conviction. "I am afraid I am stupid ever like them." The schoolmaster could scarcely keep smiling. "You are old yet, Gratian," he said. "It is possible may change. Besides, ways beginning's worst. You cannot read easily yet--not well enough enjoy reading yourself?" "No, sir," said boy, hanging his head again. "Well, then, wait see do not change books lessons." "And I do not ever change," said Gratian earnestly. "Can people ever things well do not like doing?" The schoolmaster looked him. It curious question boy nine years old. "Yes," he said, "I hope so, indeed," his mind went back time he looked forward something different village schoolmaster, he could fancied employment could less his liking teaching. "I hope so, indeed," he repeated. "And work you--get like work whatever is." "Thank you, sir," said boy, master turned away. Then thought struck him. "What best like doing, Gratian?" The boy hesitated. Then he grew little red. "It is not anything really," he said; "it is mother calls dreaming--out moors, sir, that is best all--with wind about, nothing moor sky. And feel keeps me. Even I am home kitchen fire, I shut eyes I fancy it." The master nodded his head. "Dreaming harm right place. But one nothing dream, dreams would lose colour, I expect." "That is something like _they_ said, again," thought boy himself. The schoolmaster walked away. "A child something uncommon him, I fancy," he said his mind. "One sees sometimes child living much alone nature he does. But I scarcely think he is clever, rough daily life likely nip bud sort poetry imagination may germs of." He did not quite understand Gratian, then, too, he did not take account born protection four winds heaven. But Gratian felt much happier his talk master, afternoon lessons went better. They generally easier morning ones, often interesting. This afternoon geography lesson. The master drew great frame big maps hanging it, explained children he went along. It north to-day, far away north, ice-fields spread hundreds miles everything sleep whiteness silence. And Gratian listened parted lips earnest eyes. He seemed see all. "I wish I knew much he does," he thought. "I wish I could read books myself." And first time came home faint, shadowy feeling books are--of treasures buried rows rows little black letters he often wished never invented. "Yes," he said himself, "I will try learn I read myself." It growing already little dusk he set his walk home. The evenings beginning "to draw in" country folk say. But little cared merry throng poured schoolroom gate five of the clock rang church clock, chattering, racing, tumbling other, pushing, pulling, shouting, play. For good-natured set, though rough ready--these hardy moor children. And grow honest sturdy men women, hospitable kindly, active thrifty, though care little beyond corner world, would scarcely find books "learning" existence suddenly made end of. There mischievous imps among them, nevertheless, none Tony, miller's son. He meant harm, he loved teasing, Gratian, gentle silent, often tempting victim. This evening, sometimes happened, dozen children whose homes lay end village, past road Farm, went together. "We will run bit road home thee, Gratian," said Tony. And though boy much care company, he thought would unfriendly say so, he like refuse Tony insisted carrying his satchel him. "There is books mine," he said; "I took home dinner-time, I am sure shoulders aching get Farm weight yours. My goodness, many books got it? I say," he pretended examine them, "here is Gratian Conyfer going head school, put us shame his learning." But Gratian said nothing he seemed satisfied, stopping minute two arrange satchel again, ran others. "It is getting dark, Tony," said his sister Dolly, "we must not go farther. Good-night, Gratian, we have brought bit way--Tony, Ralph, I," children gradually fallen off. "Yes--a good mile it, thank you, Dolly. And thank you, Tony, helping satchel--that is right, thank you," Tony officiously fastening on. "Good-night," said Tony; "you are coward way, Gratian. I should not like way go dark, dark soon. There queer things seen moor sunset, folks say." "Ay, say," said Ralph. "I will home time," Gratian called back. For he know fear was. But he ran awhile, he felt tired usual. Was perhaps fit crying he dinner-time made weary? He plodded on, however, shifting his satchel time time, felt strangely heavy, queer tales he heard little mountain man would jump shoulders, cling till he strangled you, unless remembered right spell force with; brownies catch children invisible ropes, make run round round without knowing left straight road, till drop fatigue, came his mind. "There must something wrong satchel," he said last, he pulled round he could open it. He drew his hand cry vexation distress. Tony, yes must Tony--though first he half-inclined think mountain men brownies playing tricks him--Tony filled satchel heavy stones, doubt taken books time he pretending examine them. It bad. And he done books? "He may taken home him, he may hidden get he passes by, he may left moor, rains they will spoilt, copy-books sure blow away." For his new ardour, Gratian brought home books kinds, meaning work well his master quite astonished next day, poor little fellow sat heather, his arms shoulders aching sore, let tears roll his face. Suddenly slight sound, something murmur rustle, little way him, made look round. It unusually still evening; Gratian scarcely ever known moorland road still--it could wind then! He looked round curiously, moment two forgot his troubles his wonder could be. There was, again, boy started his feet. CHAPTER III. FLYING VISITS "I see thee not, I clasp thee not; Yet feel I thou art nigh." _To Summer Wind._--SIR NOEL PATON Yes--he heard again, time sounded almost like voices speaking. He turned side whence came, his surprise, darkness, glimmered instant two sudden light. It scarcely indeed called light; like reflection faint colour dark background. "It like black rainbow," said Gratian himself. "I wonder sorts rainbows come night. I wonder----" suddenly waft soft though fresh air his cheek made start. All around him, instant before, still he could understand it, his surprise lessened voice sounded close his ear. "What books, Gratian? How going find them?" [Illustration: Was fancy he seen waving, fluttering form beside him?] The boy turned look speaking. His first thought one his companions, knowing trick Tony played him, run books. But figure beside one his companions--was one all? Gratian rubbed his eyes; faint light remained,--the last rays reflected sunset--were bewildering decided night; fancy he heard voice speaking? fancy he seen waving, fluttering form beside him? No, again; softly moving garments, something green radiance them, sweet, fair face, like face dream, seen instant hidden wave mist seemed come him, gentle yet cheery voice repeating again-- "What books, Gratian? How going find them?" "I do not know," said boy. "Who you? How know them, help find them?" But sound his voice, rough sharp, yet thick somehow seemed, comparison soft clearness tones he heard, fell his ears strangely. It seemed awake him. "Am I dreaming?" he said himself. "There one there. How silly speak nobody! I might well speaking wind!" "Exactly," said voice, followed time little burst sweetest laughter Gratian ever heard. "Come, Gratian, do not dull; what is wrong eyes? Come, dear, want find books, that is say. You see now, do not you?" And fresh waft passed across his cheeks, flutter radiant green fair face caught his eyes. "Yes," he said, "I see now--or--or I see half second ago," even he said vision seemed fade. "That is right--then come." He opening his lips ask where, he time, he need so. The breeze, slight was, seemed draw onwards, faint, quivering green light gleamed moment moment him. It evident way he go. Only instant misgiving came he hesitated. "I say," he called out, "you must not offended, you are will-of-the-wisp, you? I do not want follow one them. They are good." Again soft laughter, sounded kind pleasant, least mocking. "That is right. Never anything say will-of-the-wisps, Gratian. But I am one--see--I keep way. I do not dance jerk side side." It true; wonderful fast she--if she, voice sounded like woman's--got ground Gratian her, without faltering stumbling even getting breath. "Here are," she said, "stoop Gratian--there books hidden beside furze bush feet. And going rain; would quite spoilt morning even I done best. It ugly trick Master Tony's. There now, got them?" "Yes, thank you," said Gratian, fumbling his satchel, still hanging round his shoulders, though his surprise empty, he remember thrown stones out, "I got now. Thank _very_ much whoever are. I would like kiss I could see long enough time." But breath like butterfly's kiss fluttered his cheek, gleam two soft bluey-green eyes seemed hundredth part second dance his own. "I kissed you," said voice, sounding farther away, "and first thousandth time known it! But waking little now; baby boy learning see hear feel. Good-bye--good-night, Gratian. Work best books to-night--get home fast can. By bye late; shall I speed way? You know far to-morrow morning--look furze bush right path turns last time, see I do not know help home time." And almost last words faded, Gratian felt gently lifted his feet--a rush, soft whiz, he standing Farm gate, shone warm ruddy glow unshuttered windows big kitchen, his mother's voice, she heard latch click, called him-- "Is you, Gratian? You late; still, beautiful evening I really begun think blown away coming moor." And Gratian rubbed his eyes he came blinking kitchen. His mother's words puzzled him, though he knew she joking. It _was_ still night--that funny part it. "Why, look world you would nap, boy," she went on, Gratian stood rubbing his hands fire, wondering perhaps he had. He half-inclined tell his mother Tony's trick come it. But she might say he dreamt it, would seem ill-natured Tony. "And I do not want mother father think I am always dreaming fancying," he thought himself, moment farmer's footsteps heard he came supper. "Anyway I want see I mean get better school I done." He speak much table, he tried help his mother passing her whatever she wanted, jumping fetch anything missing. And great pleasure his father twice nodded smiled approvingly. "He is getting quite handy lad--eh, mother?" he said. As soon supper cleared away, Gratian set work his lessons light heart. It wonderful much easier interesting seemed he really gave his whole attention, especially since he tried understand teacher said them. "If I tried like before, much I now," he could help saying sigh. "And queer thing is, I try I want try. My head begins feel much tidier." But goodwill world, nine years old head cannot _very_ much time. Gratian finished lessons he _had_ next day going back his books wish learn again, thoroughly, much he really taken understood, his distress his poor little head bumped volume him, he found start he going sleep! Still was not late--mother said nothing yet bed-time. "It I got stupid, lazy way learning, I suppose," he said himself, getting his seat. "Perhaps air wake bit," he went little entrance hall stood porch, looking out. It different night last. All still calm name Farm seem suit it. Gratian leant door-post, looking sky, then, like evening before, old Jonas, followed Watch, came round corner. "Good evening, Jonas," said boy. "How quiet to-night! There was not much storm all." "No, Master Gratian," replied shepherd; "I told a-knocking bit keep hands in;" he stood still looked sky. "I do not like still this," said boy. "It does not seem right. I came breath air wake up. I have working hard lessons, Jonas; I am going always work hard now. But I wish I was not sleepy." "Sign you have worked enough to-night, maybe," said Jonas. But he spoke, Gratian started. "Jonas," he said, "did see sort light there--across grass front, sort golden-looking flash? ah, again," moment soft, almost warm waft air seemed float across his face, Gratian fancied he heard words, "good boy, good boy." "It Is breath south wind getting up," said old Jonas quietly. "I have often thought there is colours winds, Master Gratian, though folk would laugh old silly I said so." "_Colours_," repeated Gratian, "do mean many colours? I was not saying anything wind though, Jonas--did feel too? It there--look, Jonas--it seemed come behind big bush." "Due south, due south," said Jonas. "And golden yellow fancy south." "And north, the----" began Gratian eagerly, his mother's voice interrupted him. "Bedtime, Gratian," she called, "come put away books. You have done enough lessons to-night." Gratian gave little shake impatience. "How tiresome," he said. "I quite awake now. I want go telling winds, Jonas, I want lot lessons. I cannot go bed yet," even words his lips, he started shivered. "Jonas, cannot south wind. It is cold anything." For sharp keen gust suddenly come round corner, rasping child's unprotected face almost "like knife" people sometimes say, Watch, rubbing his nose Gratian, gave snort disgust. "You see Watch feels too," said boy. But Jonas turned little looked calmly. "I cannot say I felt it, Master Gratian," he said. "But there is answering winds freaks Four Winds Farm, it is natural know  them most. All same, I take you are feeling cold chilly-like means bed best place. You are getting sleepy--to say nothing Missus calling ye go." And mother's voice heard. "Gratian, Gratian, boy. Do not hear me?" He moved, slowly. A little imp opposition taken abode boy. Perhaps he feeling pleased his good resolutions beginnings! "Too bad," he muttered himself, "just I getting understand lessons better. Old Jonas stupid." Again short, sharp cutting slap cold air his face, spite boy moved quickly. "Good-night, Jonas," he said rather grumpily, though he would let shiver fear he told showed he sleepy, "I am going. I am tired, I am going same. Only say it is south wind--!" "I do not say now. I said _was_ south--that soft feeling one could see glow south it. Like enough it is east now; is not winds meet? Well, I am too. Good-night, master." "And you will tell colours another time, will not you, Jonas?" said Gratian mollified tone. "Or you will tell me, maybe," said old man. "Never fear--we will good talks it. Out moor holiday, nobody sheep Watch hear fancies--that is best time--is not it?" And old shepherd whistled dog disappeared round corner house. His mother met Gratian kitchen door. "I coming look you," she said. "Put away books now. You would good to-night." "I was not sleepy, mother. I went door wake up," he replied. But his tone longer fretful cross. "Feeling needed waking something like sleepy," she answered smiling. "And lessons learn found books, Gratian." He understand, he kept words his mind think over. "Good-night, mother," he lifted his soft round face her kiss. "Good-night, boy. Father gone stable speak one men. I will say good-night you. Pleasant dreams, get early like want work more." "Mother," said Gratian hesitatingly. "Well?" "Is good thing born four winds meet?" She laughed. "I cannot say," she replied. "It is done harm far. But do not begin getting head full fancies, boy. Off bed, get sleep fast can. Pleasant dreams." "But, mother," said child he went upstairs, "dreams fancies." "Yes, do not waste time. There is harm dreaming we are asleep--we cannot aught else then." "Oh," said Gratian, "it is dreaming day wastes time then." He turning corner stair he said so, speaking his mother. Just little waft air came right his face. It sharp touch made start door, soft warm breath old Jonas said south wind. Rather remind Gratian kindly breeze sea-green glimmerings moor. He stood still instant. Again fluttered him, he heard words, "Not always, Gratian; always." "What I saying?" he asked himself. "Ah yes--that dreaming day waste time! And she says 'Not always.' You puzzling people whoever are," he went on; "you whose voices I hear chimney, seem know I thinking whether I say not." And he lifted his little face towards corner whence sudden draught come, fell his ears sound rippling laughter--the merriest yet softest laughter he ever heard, several voices seemed mingle. So near seemed first he could fancied came old granary side wooden partition shutting staircase, again, instant, seemed dance flicker away, till nothing remained faint ringing echo, might well slight rattle glass old casement window. Then silent, boy went his room, soon covered fast asleep his little white bed. There voices chimney night, Gratian hear them. But he curious dream. CHAPTER IV. A RAINBOW DANCE "Purple azure, white green golden, * * * * * whirl Over thousand motions." _Prometheus Unbound._--SHELLEY He dreamt he awoke, found his comfortable bed his room, equally comfortable much uncommon bed different place. Out moor! He opened his eyes stared surprise; stars, overhead, blinking winking asking business little boy among middle night. And he find he was, he felt still surprised warm cozy. For he felt perfectly so, even though he neither blankets sheets pillow, instead complete nest softest moss him. He lying it, covered perfectly bird covered feathers. "Dear me," he said himself, "this funny. How I got here, covered like this?" But still he feel excessively surprised he awake; dreams, everybody knows, surprise one feels quickly disappears, one generally ready take things come. So he lay still, quietly gazing him. And gradually murmur approaching sound caught his ears. It like soft voices fluttering garments breezes among trees, mixed together, till came nearer voices detached sounds, he heard saying. "Yes, he deserves treat, poor child," said one gentle caressing tones; "you teased enough, sisters." "Teased him!" exclaimed another voice, time seemed familiar one him; "_I_ tease him! Why, well know, mission life comfort console. I do not believe petting praising extent do, perhaps--still cannot say I ever tease. Laugh little then, I may. But harm." "I never pet praise except deserved," murmured first voice--and he heard soft tones sort delicious languor seemed creep Gratian--"never. But I beg pardon, sister, I misjudged you. You rigorous sometimes, know, and----" "So much better--so much better," broke clear cutting distinctness another voice; "how would world go round--that say, would ships sail windmills turn--if four sweet silky you, golden-winged sister? But _I_ teased child call it--I slapped face; yes, I ready again--to sting sharply, I think he needs it." "Right, right--quite right," said another voice, exactly sharp clear like last, yet resemblance it, though deeper sterner strange cold strength accents. "You his true friend so. I part shall always ready invigorate support him--to brace battles he must fight. But you, sister, rare gift correction discerning weak points may lead defeat failure. Yours ungrateful task truly, valuable monitor." "I must find satisfaction considerations; plain I shall never get elsewhere," replied former speaker, rather bitterly. "What horrid things said me, sure! Every ache pain laid door--I 'neither good man beast,' I told! yet--I grim gray, I, sisters? There rosy glow trail garments people short-sighted colour-blind." "True, indeed, knows better I," said sweet mellow tones first speaker. "When come way dance together, sister, could less grim you?" "Ah, indeed," said cold, stern voice, sounded less stern now, "then her sharp biting words came neighbourhood _me_. Ah well--I bear reproach." "I think so," said voice Gratian recognised, "for know heart, great icy creature, love fun well one. How whirl leap rush tear about, spirits really get better you! And pretty playthings--your snow-flakes filigree icicles--none us boast treasures, speak icebergs crystal palaces, hide heaven knows what. My poor waves foam, though I allow pretty way, nothing possessions." [Illustration: "Now dance--our rainbow dance, sisters--no need wake roughly. We need kiss his eyelids."] "Never mind that. _I_ do not grumble, though I might. What one millions tons sand toy, I like know? And little else comes way I play catch-and-toss with! I waft scents about, sure--there pleasure that. But dance--our rainbow dance, sisters--no need wake roughly. We need kiss his eyelids." And Gratian, time, strange say, known his eyes closed again, felt across his lids breeze fresh sudden he naturally unclosed see whence came. And open he feel inclined shut again, I assure you. The sight pretty--and sight only. For voices melted music--far first, slow degrees coming nearer; rising, falling, swelling, sinking, bright rejoicing like song lark, soft low tones mother hushing her baby sleep, wildly triumphant like battle strain victory, even listened changing mournful, solemn cadence dirge, till last mingled slow, even measure stately harmony, colours weaving distance, like plaited rainbow boy's eyes, took definite form drew near him. He saw then--the four invisible sisters; he saw them, yet hard tell he saw! They distinct yet vague, separate yet together. But degrees he distinguished better. There his old friend floating sea-green-and-blue mantle, streaming fair hair loving sad eyes, next her sister golden wings glowing locks laughing rosy face, gray shrouded nimble figure, seemed everywhere once, whose features Gratian could scarcely see, though pair bright sparkling eyes flashed then, sometimes gleam radiant red lighted grim robe. And meshes dance glided white form genius north--cold stately, sparkling she moved, though shaded steel-blue veil covered dusky head. But dance went on, music gradually grew faster soft regular movements changed quicker measure. In four figures wove unwove together, quickly moved varied brilliant grew colours seemed part them, seemed others well her own, Gratian understood spoken rainbow dance. Golden-wings glowed every shade reflected her rich background, sister sea grew warmer red yellow shone among lapping folds her mantle, feather-like trimming foam, gray East-wind's garments grew ruddier, like sky sunrise, cold white icy North glimmered gleamed like opal. And faster faster danced glided whirled about, till Gratian felt his breath going, another moment he would carried away rush. "Stop, stop," he cried last. "It beautiful, lovely, breath going. Stop." Instantly four heads turned towards him, four pairs wings sheathed themselves, eyes, laughing gentle, piercing grave, seemed gazing once, eight outstretched arms seemed lift upwards. "No--no--" he said, "I do not want--I do not----." But struggle speak he awoke. He his bed course, light he saw must nearly time get up. He stretched sleepily, smiling he so. "What nice dreams I had," he said himself. "I wonder come working well lessons? _They_ said treat me. I wish I could go sleep dream again." But he heard his mother's voice calling stair him. "Are up, Gratian? You late quick." Gratian gave little shake impatience bedclothes; he glanced window--the sky gray overcast, every sign rainy day it. He tucked again, even though he knew foolish thus delay evil moment. "It is bad," he thought. "I _never_ I want. Last night I go bed I wanted sit up, I get I want stay bed." But moment strange thing happened. The little casement window burst open bang, blast cold sharp wind dashed room, upsetting chair, scattering Gratian's clothes, neatly laid together little heap, flinging bed whirl, coverlet took playing antics turn, blankets doubt would followed example Gratian clutched them. But his comfort destroyed--no possibility feeling warm snug window open uproar going on. Gratian sprang rage, ran window. He shut easily enough. "I cannot think made fly open," he said himself; "there wind night, never burst open before." He stood shivering undecided. Now window shut, bed looked comfortable again. "I will get five minutes," he said himself; "I am shivering cold wind, I shall not get warm day." He turned bed, one little foot raised get in, lo behold, rattle bang, window burst open! Gratian flew back, shut obediently before. But he thoroughly awakened alert. There good going back bed he blown fashion, Gratian set dress himself, though rather surly mood, keeping eye rebellious window while. But window behaved quite well--it showed signs bursting open, even rattle! Gratian ready good time all. "You look cold, boy," said his mother, he seated table eating his breakfast. "The wind blew window open twice, made room cold," he replied rather dolefully. "Blew window open? That is strange," said his father. "The wind's east morning, it is east wind could burst window. You cannot shut properly." "Yes, father, I did--the first time I shut well second, did not blow open second time. But I _know_ I shut well times. I think must east, felt sharp blew in." "It must changed quickly then," said farmer, eyeing sky large old-fashioned kitchen window front him. "That is queer thing hereabouts; many day I put answer, I could not say way wind blowing." "Or way _wasn't_ blowing, would like it," said Mrs. Conyfer smile. "It is hoped it will blow right way school anyway, Gratian. You do not look sure morning!" "I am cold, mother, I have always got I do not want. Last night I did not want go bed, morning I did not want get up, I do not want go school, I must." He got slowly unwillingly began putting his books together. His mother looked slight smile her face. "'Must''s grand word, Gratian," she said. "I do not know we would without it. You will feel right you are scampering across moor." "Maybe," he replied. But his tone rather plaintive still. He feeling "sorry himself" morning. Things general, however, seem brighter, his mother prophesied would, he found outside. It really cold all; one breezy yet chilly mornings when, though nothing depressing air, curious feeling mystery--as nature holding secret discussions, winds waves, hills clouds, trees birds even, know about, we--clumsy creatures are--are yet shut from. "What about, I wonder?" said Gratian himself, he became conscious feeling--an _autumn_ feeling always is, I think. "Everything seems grave. Are planning winter coming, flowers tender little plants taken care till over? Or going great storm sky? perhaps trying settle without battle, look gloomy there." For grayness threatening steel-blue shade betokens disturbance kind. Still child's spirits rose he ran; something reviving little gusts moorland breeze met every then, he forgot everything else pleasure quick movement glow soon replaced chilly feelings he set out. He run good way, something white, light-coloured, fluttering ground little way him, caught his eye. And he drew nearer he saw book, papers kind, hooked low-growing furze bush. Suddenly words mysterious figure night returned his mind--"Look furze bush right path turns last time," she said. Gratian stopped short. Yes--there front landmark--the path turned last time, she said. He looked astonishment. "This books last night, then," he said himself. "I idea I come far! Why, I home half second--it strange--I could fancy dream, else last night rainbow dance _wasn't_ dream." He ran white thing still fluttering appealingly, begging detach it. Poor white thing! It exercise-book. At first Gratian fancied must one his copy-books, left behind mistake his fairy friend given back rest his books. But soon he took his hands saw neat, clear characters, he knew his, he need look signature, "Anthony Ferris," guess belonged miller's son--for Tony clever boy, almost head school, famed his good writing. "Ah ha," thought Gratian triumphantly, "I now, Master Tony." He recognised book containing Tony's dictation lessons, wrongly spelt words--not many them, Tony good speller too--marked schoolmaster. "Tony must meant take book home copy clear, correct wrong spelling," thought Gratian. And he remembered hearing teacher telling Tony's class neatness done would depend several important good marks. "He will head his class, he is lost book. Serve right trick he played me," said Gratian himself, he rolled tattered book slipped his satchel. "It is badly torn he could copied right, would torn pieces evening, wind's getting up. So is not fault his own--nasty spiteful fellow. Where would _my_ poor books now, thanks him?" The wind getting indeed--and cold biting wind too. For Gratian thus thinking, came gust he seldom felt force of. For instant he staggered fell, unprepared he sudden buffet. It took his strength agility keep his feet short remainder moorland path, sharp violent blasts. And face hands tingling smarting painfully he entered schoolroom. CHAPTER V. GOOD FOR EVIL "For it is sweet stammer one letter Of Eternal's language;--on earth called forgiveness!" _The Children Lord's Supper._--LONGFELLOW Tony's face almost first thing he caught sight of. It late, several children already there, Tony, contrary his custom, instead playing outside till last moment, schoolroom eagerly searching something among slates books belonging his class. Gratian understood reason, smiled inwardly--but he smiled visibly I do not think his face would improved it. Nor real pleasure rejoicing feeling triumph moment made forget his smarting face hands. "How red look, Gratian," said Dolly, Tony's sister, "have crying?" "Crying--no, nonsense, Dolly," he replied tone gentle Gratian seldom used. "Whose face would not red horrible wind cutting one pieces." "Wind!" repeated Dolly, "I did not feel wind. It must got sudden. Did get home quickly last night?" Gratian looked her. For half instant he wondered meaning her question--had Dolly anything trick played him? But his glance her kindly, honest face reassured him. He going answer Tony interrupted him. "Got home quick," he said, looking grin; "of course he did. He hurry get work. Did not see lot books he took home him? My! shoulders must ached got Farm, Gratian. Mine did, I know, though it was short bit I carried satchel." "It pretty heavy," said Gratian, unfastening he spoke, coolly taking books one another, watching Tony while, "but nothing hurt. And I got lessons done nicely. It kind you, Tony, help carry satchel." Tony stared--with eyes mouth wide open. "What is matter?" said his sister. "You look you would seen ghost, Tony." The boy turned away, muttering himself. "Tony's put morning," said Dolly low voice Gratian, "and I cannot help sorry too. He is lost his exercise-book he copy clear--and master said it would getting prize. Tony's great taking." "How he lose it?" asked Gratian rather queer feeling, he wondered Dolly would say she knew moment lost book safely hidden away bottom his satchel, he took care leave within Tony's reach. "He does not know," said Dolly dolefully. "He is sure he left school last night. We looking evening, he thought maybe it would all. But is not." Then bell rang lessons begin, Gratian saw Tony, side schoolroom higher class, though Dolly himself, she places off, chance talking whispering. Gratian's lessons well learnt understood. It long he found higher his class he almost ever done before, he caught master's eye looking approval, smile encouragement his face. Why he could meet brightly answering smile he would done day before? Why he turn away, his cheeks tingling wind slapping them, inside sheltered schoolroom? The master felt little disappointed. "He never really well he foolishly shy bashful," he said himself, Gratian turned away ashamed grateful kind words teacher said end morning's lessons; boy, corner playground children run home dinner, felt nearly, quite, unhappy day before. "I do not see I mind Tony," he thinking he sat there. "He is naughty, unkind boy, he deserves punished. If had not _her_ helping me, I would not known lessons bit morning, master would thought I never going try. I hope Tony lose his place prize everything. Oh, cold is!" round wall, _through_ indeed, almost seemed, came sneaking sharp little gust air, cold, cutting, Gratian actually shivered shook, smarting his face began again. "I feel cold even bones," he said himself. Just voices reached his ear. The door schoolhouse opened master appeared, showing lady, evidently come speak something. She pleasant-looking lady, Gratian's eyes rested satisfaction her pretty dress graceful figure. "Then forget it? You let know days think?" Gratian heard her say. "Certainly, madam," replied schoolmaster. "I already one two mind who, I think, may suitable. But I like think ask parents' consent." "Of course--of course. Good-bye present, thank you," said lady, she went little garden-gate schoolmaster returned his house. "I wonder talking about," thought Gratian. But he soon forgot again--his mind full affairs. Tony looked vexed unhappy afternoon, Dolly's rosy face bore traces tears. She overtook Gratian his way home evening, began talking lost book. "It is vexing Tony, is not it?" she said, "and know, Gratian, it is even vexing thought. Did see lady school to-day? Do know she was?" Gratian shook his head. "She is lady Big House road, that is shut long. It is not her house, she is sister cousin gentleman belongs to, he is lent her doctors said air hereabouts would good her little boy. He is ill someway, he scarcely walk. And she came school to-day ask master one boys--his best boy, she said--might go sometimes play her little boy read little. And Tony sure top class he finished copying exercises--he would put right faults master marked, wanted copying. But he is chance; boys nearly done." "How know lady said?" Gratian asked. "The master told mother. He met her village afternoon lessons, asked her she would let Tony go, he head his class." "And would he like go, d'ye think, Dolly?" asked Gratian. "He would like head his class, anyway," sister replied. "I do not know father let go, we are busy mill, Tony's big enough help he is school. But he would like see Ben conceited Robert put him. If now, Gratian, I do not think he would mind much." Gratian's heart beat fast her words. Visions pleasure going see pretty lady her boy, hearing her soft voice speaking him, seeing inside Big House, always subject curiosity children village, rose temptingly him. But soon faded. "Me!" he exclaimed, "I would chance--even failing Tony." "I do not know," said Dolly. "You are never naughty boy, read nice like. Master always seems think read next best Tony. I should not wonder he sent you, he is vexed Tony. And he that, he told writing neatly. I think shown gentlemen come see school sometimes. But I musn't go farther you, Gratian. It will dark I get home. I am afraid Tony must dropped book here, blew away. Good-night, Gratian." "Good-night, Dolly," he replied. And little hesitation he added, "I wish--I wish Tony had not lost his book." "Thank you, Gratian," said little girl she ran off. Gratian stood looked her queer mixture feelings. It true, he said Dolly, he wish Tony lost his book, almost he wished _he_ found it. But now, standing softly fading light, evening breeze--no longer sharp blast morning--gently fanning his cheeks, looking little Dolly she ran home, thinking Tony's sunburnt troubled face, angry feelings seemed grow fainter, till wish see his schoolfellow punished his mischievous trick died away altogether. And he got this, quick step still better things. "I _will_, I _will_," he shouted aloud, though one--_was_ one?--to hear. And he sprang forward rush Dolly overtake her, seemed he half-lifted his feet, moment another waft breeze he feeling, though still softer scent spring flowers it, blew his face. "Are kissing me, kind wind?" he said laughing, answer, were, he felt blown along almost swiftly night before. At rate take long gain ground miller's daughter. "Dolly, Dolly," he called he saw within paces her. "Stop, stop. I something you--something say you." Dolly turned round astonishment. "Gratian!" she exclaimed, "have running time? I would waited I would known." [Illustration: "Look here, Dolly," he held her poor copy-book he already taken his satchel.] "Never mind. I ran fast," said Gratian. "Look here, Dolly," he held her poor copy-book he already taken his satchel. "This I ran for; give Tony, and----" "Tony's lost exercise-book!" cried Dolly. "Oh Gratian, glad he be. Where find it? _How_ good you! Did find now, since said good-night me?" Gratian's face grew red, dark Dolly see. "No," he said, "I found before. But--but--Tony done bad turn, Dolly, was not easy--not once--to good one instead. But I have done now, may tell I say. I am quite earnest, I am glad I have done it. Tell I hope he will head his class now, anyway, and----" "Gratian," said Dolly, catching hold his arm she spoke, "I do not know trick Tony played you, tried play you. But I know he is terrible fond tricks, though I do not think he is got bad heart. And bad play you, was--you never ill turns none us." "I have near time, though," said Gratian, feeling, temptation over, comfort confessing worst. "I mad Tony, I did not like bringing give back his book. I do not want think better I am, Dolly." "But I think good same, I do," said little girl earnestly, "and I will tell Tony so. And shall not tricks played him--he is bad that. Thank much, Gratian. If he gets prize, it will you." "And going Big House," added Gratian, rather sadly. "He will one now. I think that is far getting prize. It thinking made feel I _must_ give his book. I would give good deal, I know, one go Big House." "Would you?" said Dolly, little surprised, often Gratian spoke eagerly anything. "I do not know I would care much it. And sure might one had not helped Tony now! But I do not know would much fun all--just amusing little boy that is ill." "You did not see lady, Dolly, _I_ did," said Gratian. "She is like one I ever saw before--she is beautiful. Her hair's little colour yours, I think, her skin's like--like cream, her eyes kind forget-me-nots." "Was she finely dressed?" asked Dolly, becoming interested. "Yes--at least I think so. Her dress soft, nice sort shiny way she moved, she spoke prettily. And oh, Dolly, it would terribly nice see Big House. Fancy, I have heard tell beautiful pictures there." "Pictures--big ones gold frames, mean?" Dolly inquired. "I do not know gold frames. I have never seen any. But pictures sorts things--of places far away, I daresay, sky blue big sea--like master tells us sometimes geography. Oh, I would like anything see pictures, Dolly." "I never thought things. What funny boy are, Gratian," said Dolly, she ran joyfully, Tony's tattered book her hand. It take Gratian long make his way home--the feeling done right "adds feather heel." But he sped along moorland path he could help wondering his soft-voiced friend night anywhere near. "I think she must pleased me," he thought. "It feels like her kissing me," evening breeze met he ran. "Is Golden-wings, you, Spirit Waves?" he said, he learnt his dream think thus. And little soft laughter air told he far wrong. "Perhaps together," he thought. "I think pleased. It nicer sharp East-wind comes snapping one--though all, East-wind, I think perhaps I thank stung morning--I rather think I deserved it." Whiz, rush, dash--came sharp blast he spoke. Gratian started, half moment felt almost angry. "I did not deserve now, though," he said. But ripple laughter made his vexation fade away. "You silly boy," came whisper close his ear. "Cannot take joke?" "Yes, I can, well one;" sooner words his mouth again, whir swoop becoming familiar him, he raised ground, really, he knew he was, he found gate farm-house. His mother coming door. "Dear me, child," she said, "how suddenly come! I several times gate look you, though yet dark I did not see you." "I come quickly, mother dear," said Gratian, moment he thought telling her his strange new friends. But somehow, he point so, words would come, his feelings grew misty confused one tries recollect dream one knows one's memory moment before. And he felt voices winds little told songs birds heard themselves. So he looked his mother's face smile, she stooped kissed him--which she often do. For moorland people soft caressing ways, rather sharp rugged, though hearts true. "I wonder come from, sometimes, Gratian," said his mother half-laughing. "You do not seem like children about." "But mother, I am getting dreaming lessons. I indeed," said child brightly. "I think ask master next time, he will tell he is pleased me." "That is good boy," said she well pleased. So day ended well child Four Winds. CHAPTER VI. ORGAN TONES "Music, soft voices die, Vibrates memory." SHELLEY As Gratian running school next morning he felt one tugging his coat, looking round, Tony, his round face redder usual, his eyes bright yet shy. "She give me, Gratian--Doll did--and--and--I have thank you. I awful glad--I that." "Have got done? Will right prize that?" asked Gratian. Tony nodded. "I think so. I sat late last night writing, I think I will get done to-night. It awful good you, Gratian," Tony went on, growing his ease, "for I will not go say was not mean trick stones. But I meant go back get books keep safe till next morning. You look funny tramping along bag stones," Tony's face screwed he wanted laugh dared not. "It did not _feel_ funny," said Gratian. "It felt horrid. Indeed makes get cross think even now--do not say it, Tony." For seem if, all, miller's boy getting rather easily! And felt little hard good things falling Tony's share, he unkind another. "I want forget it," he went on; "if master knew it, he would let without good scolding. But I am going stand shivering--I tell I do not want say it, Tony." "Shivering," repeated Tony, "why it is wonderful mild morning November. Father saying so"--and tell truth Gratian thought he ran across moor. "But, Gratian, need not mad now--I know mean trick, show I know it, I promise master _shall_ know it," Tony held his head higher he said words. "There is one thing, Gratian. I wish you would tell found book, knew I would hidden yours? I have thinking thinking it, I cannot make out. Folks say there is still queer customers met moor nightfall. I wonder got fairies help you, Gratian?" added Tony laughing. Gratian laughed too. "No, Tony, was not fairies," he said, his good-humour returning. And quite restored sweet soft whisper moment breathed his ear--"no, fairies--but secret--eh, Gratian?" And Gratian laughed softly return. "Who then?" persisted Tony. But school-bell rang, time talking. Tony kept busy next day two his writing-out, took longer he expected. Gratian working hard make lost time, he felt happy. He saw master pleased, his companions beginning look never done before. But he missed his new friends. The weather still--for days he heard scarcely rustle among trees bushes, though he lain awake night, murmuring voices chimney reached his ears. "Have gone away already? Was dream?" child asked sadly. Sunday came round again, Gratian set church his father mother. Going church one his pleasures--of late especially, owner Big House, though seldom himself, generous rich, he spent money restoring church giving beautiful organ. And Sunday mornings organist came distance play it, afternoon great voice silent, one village--not even schoolmaster, supposed know things--knew play it. For reason Gratian never cared go church second time--he would much rather stayed moor Jonas Watch, sometimes, fine summer weather, walk hot tiring even big people, his mother allowed so. But now, winter hand, fit sauntering lying heather, especially Sunday clothes on, child knew use asking stay home. This Sunday afternoon brought welcome surprise. Scarcely boy settled his corner beside his mother, rich deep tones fell his ear. He started looked him, sure his fancy playing false. But no--clearer stronger grew music--there mistake, Gratian gave pleasure listening. And never beautiful. New fancies mingled his enjoyment it, seemed he could distinguish voices his friends--the loving, plaintive breath west, telling lapping waves lonely shore; sterner, deeper tones strong spirit north; even sharply thrilling blast ever-restless east wind seemed flash like lightning darts, cutting yet melting harmony. And time time sweet, rich glowing song praise lips Golden-wings, joyful. "Yes, there," said Gratian ecstasy completest pleasure. "I hear all. That perhaps come lately--it surprise! But I found out, see. Ah, I could play organ could never hide long, friends. Perhaps organ one real homes. I wonder be." And his face looked bright yet absorbed his mother could help smiling him, sat waiting moment last notes died away. "Are pleased music afternoon too?" she said. "It thanks stranger lady--the squire's cousin, come Big House. There--you see her. She closing organ." Gratian stood his tiptoes bent forward far he could. He caught one glimpse fair face, enough. It same--the lady forget-me-not eyes; his eyes beamed fresh delight. "They must friends too," first thought darted his brain; "she must know them, else she could not make voices come like that. Oh dear, I could go Big House, perhaps she would tell she knows them." But even think possibility nice. Gratian mused it, turning his mind, his will not, way home. And evening, he sat his corner reading verses master always liked his scholars say Monday morning--his father mother big Sunday books open table usual--a strange feeling came he church, listening organ; absorbing grew feeling that, fearful vanishing, he closed his eyes leaned his curly head wooden rail old chair listened. Yes, clearer fuller grew tones--he curled corner chancel time, his dream--and gradually front, were, background sound, grew voices he learnt know well. They seemed singing together first, degrees singing turned soft speaking, sound organ faded silence, opening his eyes, faint ray moonlight creeping window, he saw he his bed his room. How he come there? Had his mother carried undressed without awaking she sometimes done he tiny boy? "No--she could not. I am big heavy," he thought sleepily. "But hush! voices again." "Yes, I carried up. He sleepy--he never knew--nobody knew. The mother looked round thought he gone himself. And Golden-wings undressed him. He notice scent his little shirt he puts morning." "Humph!" replied second voice, rather surly tone, "you spoiling child, sister south. Snow-wings I must take hand while--a whi--ile." For East-wind evidently hurry. Her voice grew fainter she flying away. "Stop moment," said softest voice all. "It is fair say spoiling child--Sea-breezes I--we are nothing kind. We never pet comfort save he deserves it--we keep strictly compact. You icy sister free interfere thought right. Do hear, Gray-wings! he--ar?" And far off, top chimney, came Gray-wings's reply. "All right--all right, I have not time wait. Good-night--go--od-ni--ght," East-wind's voice sounded soft musical. Then two gentle sisters went murmuring together, said pleasant Gratian hear. "_I_ say," said Golden-wings--"_I_ say he good boy. He credit his training, little though he suspects long he charge." "He awaking things now," replied she others called Spirit Sea. "It sad think day guardianship must come end." "Well, do not think it, then. _I_ never think disagreeable things," replied bright voice. "But one help it? Think tiny he was--the queer little red-faced solemn-eyed baby, first sang lullabies him, looked forward time he hear voices one godchild _can_ hear. And now----" "Now time come, must take care say--he may awake moment. But listen, sister--I think must something--you I. Our sterner sisters well places, work play _my_ idea education. Now listen plan;" murmuring grew soft vague Gratian could longer distinguish syllables. He tried strain his ears, useless, he grew sleepy trying keep awake. The last sound he conscious flapping wings murmured "Good-night, Gratian. Good-night, little godson--good-ni--ight," he fell asleep slept till morning. He would forgotten perhaps, remembered indistinctness dream past, something unusual look little heap clothes lay chair beside his bed. They _very_ neatly folded--though Gratian prided rather his neat folding--and shirt snow-white smooth boy thought first his mother laid fresh one he asleep. But no--yesterday Sunday. Mrs. Conyfer would thought another clean one Monday extravagant--besides, even her linen drawers, scented lavender, could come delicious fragrance! Gratian snuffed sniffed ever-increasing satisfaction, words he overheard night returned his memory. And his stockings--they scented! What like I could tell you, unless true, old travellers say, miles miles away far-famed Spice Islands fragrance may perceived, wafted sea breeze. That, I think, may give faint idea perfume left South-wind her godson's garments. "So it is true--I was not dreaming," thought boy. "I wonder plot I could not hear about. I shall know long, I daresay." At breakfast he noticed his mother looking curiously. "What it, mother?" he said; "is hair neat?" "No, child. On contrary, I thinking tidy look morning. Your collar smooth clean. Can one wore yesterday?" "Yes, mother," he replied, "just look nice is. And has not nice scent?" He got he spoke stood beside her. She smoothed his collar satisfaction. "It certainly well starched ironed," she said. "Madge improving; I must tell her so. That new soap quite pleasant smell it--like new-mown hay. It is partly lavender drawers, I daresay." But Gratian smiled himself--thinking he knew better! "Gratian," said his mother, two mornings later, he starting school, "I message master yesterday. He wants see you, he busy, he says father I village to-day to-morrow, he would take kindly would look in. I must call mill father to-day--he is busy go himself--so I think I will go school, walk back together. So do not start home afternoon till I come." "No, mother, I will not," said Gratian. But he still hung he say. "What it?" asked his mother. "You are afraid master's going give bad account you?" "No, mother--not since I have cured dreaming," he answered. "I wondering I knew he going ask you." "Better wait know sure," said his mother. So Gratian set off. But he found impossible keep thinking wondering himself. Could anything Big House? Had Tony kept his promise, told master trick he played, Gratian, he, chosen? "He did not seem care much," thought Gratian, "not near much I should--oh, dear no! Still would not nice tell himself, whether he cared not." But his mother said, best wait know, instead wasting time fruitless guessing. Tony seemed quite cheerful merry, little Dolly friendly possible. After morning lessons children dispersed, schoolmaster called Gratian again. "It cold eat dinner playground, boy," he said. "After run little, come find warmer dining-room inside. But I something else say you. I talk Anthony Ferris yesterday." Gratian felt growing red, he speak. "He told trick he would played you. A unkind silly trick was, I said him; he told I will not punish him. He told more, Gratian--of finding his book giving back him, might done ill turn keeping it." "I keep one day, sir," said Gratian humbly. "Ah well, give end," said master smiling. "I pleased see right thing face temptation. And Tony feels himself. He is honest-hearted lad clever one. He done piece work I gave well, doubt he stands head boy"--here master stopped seemed thinking something. Then he went rather abruptly. "That I wanted say now, I think. Tony really grateful you, he show it, he will. Did father mother say anything coming see me?" "Please, sir, mother's coming afternoon. I am wait go home her." "Ah well, that is right." But Gratian plenty think he ate his dinner. He much impressed Tony's really told. "I wonder," he kept saying himself, "I wonder perhaps----" CHAPTER VII. THE BIG HOUSE AND THE LADY "The light love, purity grace; The mind, music breathing her face; The heart, whose softness harmonised whole." Mrs. Conyfer waiting Gratian gate schoolhouse he came out. "We must make haste," she said; "I think it is going rain." Gratian looked sky, sniffed cold evening air. "Yes," he said, "I think is." "It is cold quite I came down," Mrs. Conyfer went on--the dwellers Four Winds often spoke "coming down," meant going village--"that is perhaps rain coming. I do not want get bonnet spoilt--I might known going rain father said wind west." "Why west wind bring rain?" asked Gratian; "is comes sea?" "Nay," said his mother, "I do not know. You know better things I--you that is always listening winds hearing they have got say." Gratian looked up, little surprised. "What makes say that, mother?" he asked. Mrs. Conyfer laughed little. "I scarcely know," she said. "We always said baby seemed hear words wind--you always content lie still, matter long left, wind blowing. And seems even you are always happiest best there is wind about, though it is maybe fancy mine." But Gratian looked pleased. "No, mother," he said, "I do not think it is fancy. I think it is quite true." And he pulled his cap he spoke let wind blow his hair about, lifted his face inviting caresses. "It is getting up," he said. "But I think we will get home rain comes." His mother heard whisper reached his ear gust wind. "I help home, Gratian, mother, though she will not know it." He laughed he felt gentle, steady way blown along--never long walk Farm seemed short Mrs. Conyfer. "Dear me," she said, within yards gate, "I could not believed home! It makes difference wind us, I suppose." Gratian pulled her back moment, she going in. "Mother," he said, "what master wanted say you? Will not tell me?" "I must speak first father," she replied; "it is something must his leave first." Gratian could ask more, nothing said till next morning he starting school. Then his mother came door him. "I have message master," she said. "Listen, Gratian. You must tell father I objection his he likes he spoke yesterday. He said he would like tell himself--so I will not tell more. Maybe you will care hear it." "Ah--I do not think that," said boy, he ran off. He needed blowing school morning. The way seemed short, even though still drizzling--a cold, disagreeable, small rain, succeeded downpour night before. But Gratian cared little rain--what true child moors could?--he rather liked otherwise, especially came drifting great sheets, almost blinding moment, dispersed suddenly, standing high ground one could see slopes beneath raining stopped. It gave one feeling "above clouds" Gratian liked. But morning nothing weather panorama kind--just sheer, steady, sapping rain, wind interfere. "They tired, I daresay," thought Gratian; "for must hard work last night, getting clouds together rain. I expect Golden-wings goes altogether it is cold dreary. I wonder she is. I would like see her home--it must full beautiful colours scents." "And mine--would not like see mine?" whistled sudden cold breath his ear. "Yes, I made jump. But I am going bring snow yet--I have come moment, see much rain Green-wings got together. She must not waste it, see. I cannot her interfering reservoirs winter. I hold good old-fashioned winter--a snowy Christmas plenty picture exhibitions pet artist, Jack Frost. A good winter's healthiest end concerned." "Yes, I think too," said Gratian. He wished civil White-wings. It interesting one talk he went along, North-wind mild mood seemed agreeable companion, less snappish jerky her sister east. "That is sensible boy," said snow-bringer condescendingly; "you have something old northern spirit moorlands still, I fancy. Ah! could see north--the real north--I do not fancy would care much sleepy golden lands dreaming now." "I would like _see_ them," replied child; "I do not say I would like live always. But scents colours--they must beautiful. I seem know Golden-wings kisses me." "Humph," said Spirit North. Both she Gray-wings peculiar way saying "humph" Gratian praised either gentler sisters--"as scents I do not say--scent stupid sort thing. I do not understand anything it. But _colours_--you are mistaken, I assure you, think south beat that. You have got head full idea snow--interminable ice-fields rest it. Why, good boy, never hear Arctic sunsets--not speak Northern Lights? I could show sunsets sunrises never dreamt of--like rainbows painted gold. Ah, pity cannot come me!" "And cannot I?" asked Gratian. "I am afraid cold." The North-wind gave whistle good-natured contempt. "My dear, you would time afraid afraid--you would dead you would even looked you. Ah--it is terrible inconvenience, bodies yours--if like us, now! But I must not waste time talking, I passing I thought I would say word two. When sisters together there is never getting syllable edgeways. Good-bye, child. We will meet oftener next months." "Good-bye, Godmother White-wings," said Gratian, gust wind rushing past whistle seemed answer, "Good-bye." "I am glad little talk her," he said himself; "she is much nicer I thought she was, she makes one feel strong brisk. Dear me--what wonderful places must north she lives!" The master called aside morning lessons. "Did mother send message me, Gratian?" he asked. "Yes, sir," he repeated Mrs. Conyfer said. The schoolmaster looked pleased. "I am glad she father objection," he said. "I think may good thing several ways. But I must explain you. You know Big House call it, here? A lady her son come stay time--relations squire's----" "Yes, sir, I know," interrupted Gratian; "she plays organ Sunday afternoons, her little boy ill." "Not exactly ill, he fall, he must not walk stand much. It is dull him, home he used companions. His mother asked send one best boys--a boy could read well one thing--as playmate. At first I thought Tony Ferris, I spoke him. But Tony begged choose instead him." Gratian raised his brown eyes fixed master's face. "Does Tony want go?" he asked. "I should not like take he wants go." "I think he would happier go," said master, "and perhaps may suitable. Besides Tony thinks he owes something. He told trick he played you, know--and certainly deserve chosen he. I sure he would care much it; still give pleasure think he got you, may let pleasure." "Yes, sir," said Gratian thoughtfully. And he added, "it good Tony ask me." "Yes, was," agreed master. "Then I go?" asked Gratian. "This afternoon. I let hour earlier, stay Big House till dark. It farther home here, go road back it. We shall see get on, lady tell going again." Gratian still lingered. "What it?" said master. "Do think shall like it?" "Oh no, sir, oh no," exclaimed child. "I wondering. Are pictures Big House, think, sir?" "Yes, I think some. Are fond pictures?" "I do not know, sir. I have never seen real ones. But I have often thought them, fancied mind. There lots things I would like see pictures I cannot see way." "Well, perhaps see Big House," said master smile. Out playground Gratian ran Tony. "Has he told you?" he asked eagerly. "Yes," said Gratian. "I am go afternoon. It good you, Tony, want go instead you." Tony got rather red. "I do not know I would a-cared much, Gratian," he said. "It was not cost much. But tell truth, I want get telling master trick I would played you. And I do not know I would told it, mighty queer thing happened--it is thanks I told." "What it?" asked Gratian. "It night I bed. I would put telling, I thought maybe it would forgotten. And night sudden came storm wind woke up--the window burst open, I swear you, Gratian--I have told one else--I saw figure white, white wings, leaning bed, brought storm it. I frightened I began think bad things I done, I hollered out, 'I will tell master first thing to-morrow morning, I will.' And wind seemed go sudden came, I heard sort singing, something like organ plays low church, beautiful sweet scent flowers room; I suppose I fell asleep again, I woke morning, I could fancied dream, nobody else heard wind night." "We hear nights place," said Gratian, "but I am never frightened it." "You would night--leastways _I_ was. I durstn't go back word, dream dream--so know, Gratian, I came tell. And I hope you will enjoy Big House." "I shall thank I do, same, Tony," Gratian replied. "It is way mine. I would feel great silly going among gentry folk like that," said Tony, he scampered his dinner. About three of the clock afternoon Gratian found gates Big House. He often passed way stood looking in, he never within gates, always kept locked; strange, almost sad look loneliness desertedness place, even though gardens allowed untidy overrun. Now looked already different; padlock chain removed, marks wheels upon gravel. It seemed Gratian even he known visitors old house he would guessed it. He walked slowly avenue led gates house. He least afraid shy, he full interest expectation. He wanted see everything--to miss nothing, even walk avenue seemed full wonder charm. It _had_ charm doubt, side stood pine-trees like rows sentinels keeping guard comers, tall, stately, solemn, moving heads silent dignity, reply observations passing among there, high heard. The pines round Gratian's home tall straight--naturally, great deal buffeting order live all, course help grow tall erect. Gratian looked wonder great height. "How I wish I knew say there," he said. But drop something cold falling his face made start. It beginning rain. "I would not like wet I first see lady young gentleman," he thought. "I must quick." So he set run, perhaps much hasten matters, he got hall door he breath he stand still several minutes venturing ring. The bell, he ring it, sounded sharp hollow, almost like bell ringing empty house. And door opened, he saw large hall look bare empty, he felt little disappointed. But feeling last long. Before he time say anything servant, sweet, bright voice came sounding clearly. "Oh, he is, Fergus," words she said, another instant owner voice appeared. It lady organ. She came forward smiling, holding her hand, Gratian gazed her moment without speaking, seeming understand she speaking him. He never seen one like her before. She tall fair, her face truly lovely. But made so, delicate features pretty soft colours, sunny brightness, yet time time veiled look pitying sadness, almost sweeter. And times intense blueness her eyes grew paler fainter, looked almost gray, like sea cloud comes sunny sky above; Gratian never seen sea, he could think himself. What he say told quite well. "She like Golden-wings Green-wings mixed together," his thought. And decided this, his mind seemed grow clearer, sort confused bewilderment he felt moment wafted away, he distinguished words she repeated once. "You little boy Mr. Cornelius kindly sent see poor little boy. It kind come. I hope Fergus great friends." She thought he shy first he answer. But looking she saw shyness speaking his big brown eyes. "You afraid me, you?" she said smiling again. "Oh no," he replied. "I did not mean rude. I could not frightened you. I thinking--I never saw anybody beautiful before," he went simply, "and made think." The lady flushed little--a little. "I pleased like face," she said. "I like too, I sure Fergus will. Will come see now? He waiting eagerly you." She held her hand again, Gratian time put his little brown one confidingly. And thus she led large, cold hall, short passage, rendered light cheerful large window--here door stood open, glow warmth seemed meet drew near it. CHAPTER VIII. LITTLE FERGUS "Old portraits round order set, Carved heavy tables, chairs, buffet Of dark mahogany." MRS. SOUTHEY For bright fire burning room, sent red rays flickering dancing directions, lighting faded tints ancient curtains covers, bringing rich crimson shades shining, old dark mahogany furniture. There flowers too; bouquet autumn leaves--bronze copper olive--with two three fragile "last roses" middle, Gratian's eyes rested pleasure moment, way small figure--the interesting object all. He lying little sofa, placed within reach fire's warmth, yet near enough window see garden, watch life birds plants, clouds breezes. The autumn afternoon looked later darker Gratian he glanced within he part out-of-doors, his eyes returned pleasure nearer warmth colour, though first momentary glimpse boy sofa sort shyness made look away. For child extremely pale thin--he looked much ill Gratian prepared for, gave feeling timidity nothing else could caused. But lady soon put his ease. "Fergus, dear," she said, "here little friend hoping for. Come near us, dear boy"--for she sat low chair beside couch, evidently her usual place--"and I help get first steps making friends. To begin with," she said smiling, "do know do not know name? That seems absurd, does not it? And do not know ours." "Yes--I know _his_," said Gratian, smiling too, little gesture towards invalid, gentle half-timid one could called rude; "you said it--Fergus. I never heard name before." "It Scotch name," said lady. "One almost fancy oneself Scotland here. And tell us name." "Gratian," he replied, "Gratian Conyfer." "What nice name," said Fergus, speaking first time, "and queer one! I say said me, Gratian--I never heard name before." "How come it?" asked Fergus's mother. "I think mother called Grace, several baby brothers died, called father," he replied. "And old you?" asked Fergus, raising little his elbow. "I am eight half. I am small age I stand up--am I, mother?" "No, dear," she answered little shadow her bright face. "And you, Gratian?" "I nine," he said; "but say school I do not look much. Tony twelve, he much, much bigger." "Tony--who Tony?" asked Fergus; "is he brother?" "Oh no, I brothers. He is head boy school." "Yes," said Fergus's mother, "I remember him. He boy Mr. Cornelius first thought sending." "And did not he come?" asked Fergus. Gratian looked lady. "Did master tell you?" he asked. The lady smiled, nodded her head. "Yes," she said, "I know story. You may tell Fergus, Gratian; he would like hear it. Now I going away, I letters write. In half hour shall tea. Would like library, Fergus?" "Oh, library," he said eagerly. "I have not two days, mother. And Gratian see pictures--you told he liked pictures?--and best all, play organ us, little mother." "Then feel better to-day, boy?" she said, stooping kiss white forehead she leaving room. "Some days I cannot get like move all," she added Gratian. "Yes, I feel better," he said. "I do not mind hurting I do not feel horrible way I did not care _anything_. Have ever ill, Gratian? Do know feels?" Gratian considered. "I sore throat," he said, "but I did not mind much. It winter, I fire room, I liked see flames going dancing chimney." "Yes," said Fergus, "I know mean. I am sure must thinkings things, Gratian. Do like music too, much pictures? Mother says people like pictures much, often like music too, and--and--there is something else kind people like too, I forget what." "Flowers," suggested Gratian; "flowers trees, perhaps." "No," said Fergus, looking little puzzled, "these would count pictures, do not think? I will ask mother--she said nicely. Do not like anybody says thing seems fit things?" "Yes," said Gratian, "I think I do. But I think things myself, mostly--I have got anybody much talk to, except sometimes Jonas. He is got nice thoughts, he would never say except Watch me." "Who is Watch?" asked Fergus eagerly. "Is he dog?" "He is sheep-dog, Jonas shepherd," replied Gratian. "They are sometimes alone sheep days days--out moors. It is strange--I have sometimes--it is like another world--to see moors round, ever far, like sea, I suppose--only I have never seen sea--and creature anywhere, except wild birds sometimes." "Stop," said Fergus, closing his eyes; "yes, I see now. Go on, Gratian--is sky gray, blue little white clouds?" "Gray now," said boy, "and there is wind feel blowing. But it is coming--you know it is coming--now Watch pricks his ears, he tell much farther can, old Jonas pats little. Jonas old blue round cap--a shepherd's cap--and his face browny-red, his hair nearly white, his eyes blue. Can see him, Fergus? And sheep keep browsing--they make little scrumping noise quite, quite close them. And wind really comes great bird gives cry--up, high up--and swoops moment goes again, till looks little black speck sky. And time know wind coming. Can see all, Fergus?" "All," said boy; "it is beautiful. You must tell pictures often, Gratian, till I go again. I never one could make come so, except mother's music--they come that. Have not noticed come music?" "I do not know," said Gratian. "I have never seen real pictures--painted ones big gold frames." "There here," said Fergus; "not many, some. I like them--perhaps too. But I like pictures come go one's fancy best. That is kind mother's music brings me." "Yes," said Gratian, his eyes sparkling, "I understand." "I sure would," said Fergus, tiny touch patronising his tone, Gratian entirely single-minded see, rather perhaps object he see it. "I knew minute I saw you, you would suit me. I am glad fellow did not come instead you. But, bye, have not told that--mother said you would tell me." Gratian related story his satchel stones. Fergus boy enough laugh little, though he called mean trick; Gratian told found his books again, he looked puzzled. "How could find them?" he asked. "It nearly dark, did not say?" "I do not quite know," replied Gratian, he spoke truth. It always difficult distinguish real fancy, dreaming waking, concerning his four friends, curious way difficulty increased much he ever thought talking them, he felt he meant so. "I fancies sometimes--like dreams, perhaps--that I cannot explain. And help often--when I trouble help me." "I do not see fancies help find things lost," said Fergus, who, except his particular way, practical Gratian, "unless mean dream things, dreams come true." "It is little like that," Gratian replied. "I think I sort dream coming here. I want come--most since I heard lady play church." "Yes," said Fergus, "is not mother's playing beautiful? I have heard her play church ever long, I am glad there is organ here. She plays every day. I like music best everything world--do not you?" To Gratian gave his old answer--"I do not know yet." Then began talking commonplace things. Each told his daily life his childish interests. Fergus greatly struck account Gratian's home--the old house queer name. "How I like see it," he said, "and feel wind blow." "The winds," corrected Gratian, "the four winds." "The _four_ winds," repeated Fergus. "North, south, east, west. They do not blow together, they?" "I think sometimes. Yes, I know do--at night I am sure I have heard four together, like tones music." Fergus looked delighted. "Ah, come back music, see," he said. "There is nothing tells everything explains everything well music." "You must thought great deal," said Gratian admiringly. "I have begun think things, I think it is puzzling, though I am older you. I do not know music would explain things me." "Perhaps much me," said Fergus. "You see it is best thing--ever since I five years old I have lying like this. At home others kind, cannot quite understand," he added, shaking his head little sadly; "they run jump play. And children that, do not need think much. Still dull without them--that I begged mother try get somebody play with. But I think you are better that, Gratian. I think understand more--how it? You have never ill lie still." "No," said boy, "but I have brothers sisters play me. And perhaps it is born Four Winds--mother says herself." "I daresay is," said Fergus gravely. "Will not get better soon?" asked Gratian, looking Fergus profound sympathy. For, gentle he was, idea lie still, able run moors feel his dear winds his face, even call others help he could get window look sunshine--it seemed perhaps dreadful Gratian would done ordinary, healthy child like Tony Ferris. "Will not able walk run about--even it is little?" "I hope so," Fergus replied. "Mother says I must not expect ever quite strong. But say I am getting better. That is mother brought here. Do know I eat ever much I came? If I get well enough play--even piano--I would not mind much. I could make sorts things then--I could make pictures even moorland Four Winds Farm, I think, Gratian." "I will try tell them--I will try make fancies stories pictures," said Gratian; "then afterwards, get well play, make music." Just door opened, Fergus's mother came in. "Tea ready," she said, "and Andrew going carry library, Fergus." She looked boy little anxiously she spoke, Gratian saw slight shadow pain fear crept Fergus's face. "Mother," he said, "would perhaps better stay all? You could show Gratian pictures." The lady looked disappointed. "The tea nicely set out," she said, "and know cannot hear organ well here. And Andrew does not hurt you--he careful." Gratian looked on, anxious too. He understood must good Fergus go another room, otherwise his mother would wish it. Fergus caught sight eagerness Gratian's face, carried day. "I go," he said; "here, Andrew." A man-servant, good-humoured face strong pair arms, came forward lifted child carefully. "You walk beside me, Gratian, hold hand. If hurts much I pinch little, do not let mother know," he said whisper; thus little procession moved room right across hall another corridor. "There must window open," said Fergus; "do not feel air blowing in? Oh do not shut it, mother," lady started forward, "it is nice soft air--scented making hay. Oh, it is delicious." His mother seemed little surprised. "There window open, dear," she said. "It must feel change warm room hall. Perhaps I covered up." "Oh no, no," repeated Fergus. "I am least cold. It is cold wind all. Gratian, do not _you_ feel it?" "Yes," said Gratian, holding Fergus's hand firmly. But his eyes curious look them, he smiling inwardly himself. "Golden-wings, darling," he murmured, "I know you are there--thank much blowing away his pain." In another moment Fergus settled couch library--a lofty room rows rows books every side, nearly ceiling. It would looked gloomy dull cheerful fire one corner neat tea-table drawn it; was, sort solemn mystery pleasing Gratian. "Is not nice here?" said Fergus. "I am glad I came. And know did not hurt bit. The fresh air came seemed blow pain away." "I think really must getting stronger," said his mother, smile hopefulness her face, she busied herself tea-table; "you brought us good luck, Gratian." "I believe he has," said Fergus. "Mother, know he telling me? He born four winds meet--he _must_ lucky child, must not he, mother?" "I say so, certainly," said lady smile. "I wonder good born Sunday." "Oh far better, mother," said Fergus; "there lots children born Sundays, I never heard one born winds' meeting-place." "Gratian able tell stories, I daresay," said his mother--"stories winds tell him, perhaps--eh, Gratian?" Gratian smiled. "He telling pictures already," said Fergus; "oh, mother I am happy." "My darling," said his mother. "Now let see good appetite have. You must hungry too, Gratian, boy. You long walk home you." Gratian hungry, he hardly felt he could eat--there much look think about. Everything dainty pretty; though he well accustomed Farm perfect cleanliness neatness, new see sparkling silver, tea-kettle boiling spirit-lamp cheerful sound, pretty china glass, variety bread cakes tempt poor Fergus's appetite. And lady herself--with her forget-me-not eyes sweet voice. Gratian felt he fairyland. CHAPTER IX. MUSIC AND COUNSEL "What strange new life, finer sense, Which lifts self, bids ... rise glorious thought High hopes, inarticulate fantasies?" "Voices."--_Songs Two Worlds_ After tea Fergus's mother turned two boys. "Shall I play now?" she said, "or shall first show Gratian pictures?" "Play last thing, please," said Fergus. "I like keep mind I go bed--it makes sleep better. We go gallery show Gratian pictures; would dark waited." "It rather dark already," said lady, "still Gratian see some, next time he comes he look again." She rang bell, Andrew came, she told wheel Fergus's couch picture-gallery, opened library were. Andrew opened double door end room come in, he gently wheeled forward couch Fergus lying, pushed doorway. The gallery scarcely large enough deserve name, Gratian's eyes looked wonderful place. It long rather narrow, light came top, along sides ends hung good many pictures. All one side portraits--gentlemen wigs, ladies powder, queer, fancy dresses, mostly looking stiff unnatural, though among beautiful faces, two three portraits children, caught Gratian's eye. "What think them?" asked Fergus. Gratian hesitated. "I do not think people long ago could pretty now," he said last, "except lady long black dress--oh, she pretty, red little boy dog, two girls blowing soap-bubbles. The big one got eyes like--like lady's," he added half-timidly. The lady looked pleased. "You quick eye, Gratian," she said. "The pictures admire best here, little girl great-grandmother. Now, look side. These pictures kinds--not family ones." Gratian followed her silence. The pictures mostly landscapes--some old dark one could scarcely distinguish were. And colours brighter, boy care better--they like skies trees he ever seen even imagined, he felt disappointed. Suddenly he gave little cry. "Oh, I like that--I like that," he said, he glanced lady approval. She smiled again. "Yes," she said, "it wonderful picture. Quite much picture wind sea." Gratian gazed delight. The scene coast, one might call playfully stormy day. The waves came dancing in, crests flashing sunshine, pursued tossed wind; above, little clouds scudding along quite busy eager _their_ business, whatever was, white-sailed fishing-boats below. "Do like much?" she asked. "Yes," boy replied, "that is like I fancied pictures were. I have never seen sea, I feel must like that." And he seem care see others. [Illustration: And she sat play light sparkled glowed her fair hair, making look like gold.] Fergus getting little tired lying alone his mother Gratian made tour gallery. So Andrew called wheel back door library, whence he could best hear organ. It stood one side large hall, recess probably made purpose. It dark recess even mid-day, dusk fast increasing, lady lit candles fixed side music-desk, she sat play light sparkled glowed her fair hair, making look like gold. Gratian touched Fergus. "Does not look pretty?" he said, pointing little island light gloomy hall. Fergus nodded. "I always think mother turns angel she plays," he said. "Now, let us listen, Gratian, afterwards tell pictures music makes you, I will tell makes me." The organ old rather repair, Andrew well used blowing. That made it, I think, wonderful lady could bring music it. It fine perfect, doubtless, Gratian heard her church Sunday afternoon, still beautiful enough think nothing his delight listening. She played several pieces--some sad plaintive, joyful triumphant, Gratian begged her play last he heard church. "That good choice good-night one," she said. "It favourite Fergus's too. He calls his good-night hymn." Fergus speak--he lying his eyes shut, quiet happiness, last notes died away, "Do not speak yet, Gratian," he said, "you do not know I seeing--flocks birds slowly flying sight, sun set, one hears bell distance ringing faintly; one one lights going cottages I see foot hill, night creeping up. That _I_ see mother plays good-night. What see, Gratian?" "The moor, I think," said boy, "our moor, up, far up, behind house. It must looking I see now, minute; music coming place--a church, I think, _very_ far away. The wind bringing it--the south wind, one sea. And know music played church lots people kneeling cannot see faces, I think crying softly." "Yes," said Fergus, "that is not bad. I see too. You will soon get way, Gratian," he went on, his funny little patronising tone, "of making music-pictures practice together. That is best music, see. It makes pictures too. Now pictures never make music." "But give feelings--like telling stories--at least one I like much does. And I suppose many pictures like that--as beautiful that?" he went on, asking question lady, left organ standing Fergus, listening saying. "Yes," she said, "there many pictures I like see, many places too. Places make one wish one could paint moment one sees them. Perhaps pictures going care for, little Gratian? If so, music poetry everything you--they voice." "_Poetry_," repeated Fergus, "that is thing--the thing I could not remember name of, Gratian." Gratian looked rather puzzled. "I do not know much poetry," he said. "But I do not know anything. I never saw pictures before. There many things know about," he added little sigh. "Do not discouraged," said lady smiling. "Everybody find learn work hard." "Has everybody voice?" asked Gratian. "No, great many have not, do not use well, worse none. But do not look grave; shall plenty time talking things. I think must going home now, otherwise mother wondering become you. And thank her letting us you, say I hope may come Saturday. You do not mind long walk home--for almost dark, see?" "Oh no, I do not mind dark anything like that," said Gratian little smile, lady, even though her forget-me-not eyes clear, could quite understand. For he thinking himself, "How could I afraid, four godmothers take care me, wherever I were?" Then he turned say good-bye Fergus, little fellow stretched his two thin arms clasped round moorland child's neck. "I love you," he said; "kiss come soon, let us make stories tell other." The lady kissed too. "Thank good Fergus," she said. And Gratian, looking her face, wished he could tell her much he liked he seen heard, somehow words would come. All he could say was, "Thank you, good-night." Out-of-doors again, especially he got far well-known road he passed along every day, seemed like dream. All way avenue pines he kept glancing back see lights windows Big House--he liked think Fergus his mother fire, talking afternoon making, perhaps, plans another. "I hope his back will not hurt to-night carry bed," he said himself. "It good Golden-wings come. But I am afraid she cannot much more, winter near. Green-wings might perhaps come sometimes, but----" A sudden puff wind his face, voice his ear, interrupted him. The wind felt sharp cold, he need tingling his cheeks tell hand. "But what?" said cutting tones Gray-wings. "Ah, I know going say, Master Gratian. White-wings I sharp outspoken new friends! Much know it. On contrary, nothing would lame boy good nice blast north, he able again. It moorland air doctors, sense once, sent here. And I sure must know is not Golden-wings Green-wings met moors." "I am sorry I have offended you," said Gratian, "but need not quite cross it. I do not mind sharp I deserve it, I have quite good to-day, _quite_ good. I am sure lady would not like I was not good." "Humph!" said Gray-wings. At least she meant "humph," Gratian understood so, one else would sounded like "whri--i--zz," would put hand head sure cap hat was not going fly off. "Humph! _I_ do not set perfect, though I might boast little experience, billions years more, queer world you. And I have pretty well snubbed time kept proper place--to extent, indeed, I do not even quarrel _very_ much worse name I deserve. It is good one's pride, I make wry face swallow it, though course, same, must pleasant feeling know one quite, _quite_ good. I wish you would tell it is like." "You are horrid unkind, Gray-wings," said Gratian, feeling almost ready cry. "Just I happy, try spoil all. Tell think I have good I will listen, need not go mocking nothing." There answer, Gratian thought perhaps Gray-wings feeling ashamed herself. But he much mistaken. She reserving her breath burst laughter. Gratian course knew laughter, though I do not suppose either I would known that. "What amuses so?" asked boy. "It is Green-wings--you cannot see her unfortunately--she is posting hurry. She thinks I tease you, she knows I am rather mischievous mood to-night. But they have caught her--she cannot get past corner there, Wildridge hills are--and she fuss. The hills never like her run past without paying visit help it, she is soft-hearted go her way will-ye, nill-ye, I do. So you will trust take home all, dear godchild." "Dear Green-wings," said Gratian, "I do not like her anxious me." "Bless you, she is always pathetic humour one something," said Gray-wings. "I do not mind taking home will not mock me," said Gratian. "Are really displeased me? Have I done anything naughty without knowing it?" Gray-wings's tone suddenly changed. Never her voice sounded gentle yet earnest. "No, child. I meant warn you. It part correct warn--of two I would rather, far, warn. Do not get little head turned--do not think nothing worth, nothing beautiful, except new things may see hear learn. And never think _quite_ anything. That always mistake. What seem new another way putting old--and path real good always same--never think get faster leaving it. You cannot understand yet, time. Now put arms out, darling--I beside you. Clasp round neck; never mind feels cold--there. I safe, goes----" A whirl, rapid upbearing, rush cold, fresh air, pleasant, dreamy feeling, one rocked little boat sea. Gratian closed his eyes--he _was_ tired, poor little chap, nothing tiring new sights feelings--and knew till he found lying heather, yards Farm gates. He looked him--it quite night now--he felt drowsy still, longer tired, cold--just pleasantly warm comfortable. "Gray-wings must wrapped somehow," he said himself. "She is kind, really. But I must run in--what would mother think she saw lying here?" And he jumped ran home. The gate open, door house open too, within porch stood his mother. "Is you, Gratian?" she said, she heard his step. "Yes, mother," he replied; he came light he looked her. She much, much older-looking Fergus's mother, she married young, Gratian youngest several, others died. But he glanced her sunburnt face, saw love shining her eyes, tired rather worn daily work she was, she somehow reminded graceful lady sweet blue eyes. "I understand Gray-wings said," he thought. "It is mother's face she looks Fergus." And he held his mouth kiss. "Have happy Big House?" Mrs. Conyfer asked. "Were kind you? She seems kind lady, one trust pretty looks." "Oh! she is kind," answered Gratian eagerly; "and so is Fergus. He is her boy, mother--he cannot walk, scarcely stand. But he is getting better--the air make better." "It is hoped so, I am sure," said farmer's wife, great sympathy her tone. "It must terrible grief--the poor child--I could not find heart refuse let go Mr. Cornelius told his affliction. But happy, good you?" "Oh, mother! yes--happier ever I life." Mrs. Conyfer smiled yet sighed little. She knew her child altogether like his compeers moor country--she proud it, yet sometimes afraid vague misgiving. "Come warm yourself--it is cold evening. There is hot girdle cakes cup Fernflower's milk supper--though maybe many fine things eat Big House will not hungry." "Ah, I am, though," he said brightly; big kitchen looked cheery, little supper tempting, Gratian smiled satisfaction. "How good make nice me, mother!" he said. "I could never like _anywhere_ better home, however beautiful was." CHAPTER X. THE STORY OF THE SEA-GULL "Now brothers call bay, Now great winds shoreward blow, Now salt tides seaward flow, Now wild white horses play, Champ chafe toss spray, Children dear, let us away! This way, way!" _The Forsaken Merman_ The winter--the real winter, known country--came slowly year. There snow little frost Christmas. Fergus gained ground steadily, his mother, first dreaded experiment bleak bracing air, encouraged she stayed week week. And weeks never half-holiday two boys spend together. Gratian learning much--more even knew best full understanding of; much, much he knew. "He like different child," said schoolmaster one day lady, she looked she passing village; "if seen year ago; he seemed always dreaming clouds. I really thought I never succeed teaching anything. You opened his mind." "His mind begun open he ever saw me, Mr. Cornelius," said Fergus's mother smile. "It like flower--it asks nothing allowed grow. He uncommon child--one could imagine specially happy influences surrounded him. He seems take feel interest many different things. I wonder he grow up." "Ah yes, madam," said schoolmaster sigh. "It pity think his his father him. But yet, one do?" "One would like least find he _might_ be," she said thoughtfully. "He _good_ man, whether he ever leaves moors not--of I feel sure. And his duty stay quiet corner world, I suppose must regret it." "I suppose not. I _try_ think so," said schoolmaster. But something his tone lady suspected he looking back rather sadly dreams, long ago past, his future--dreams never come pass, left village schoolmaster. And her sympathy half-understood disappointment made her think still Gratian. "Cornelius would live child he turn one great few," she thought herself. It one afternoons Gratian always spent Fergus. She could leave her lame boy perfect comfort his friend's care, sure he would safe happy. As she made her way pine avenue drew near house, she heard bright voices welcoming her. "Mother dear," Fergus called out, "I walked twelve times along south terrace--six times six times down--with Gratian's arm. It sheltered there--just nice little soft breeze. Do know, Gratian, I often notice breeze here? It came you." "But getting colder now, boy," she answered. "You must come in. I see Mr. Cornelius, Gratian. I glad hear he pleased lessons. I would like think us distracted attention." "I am sure does not, madam," said Gratian simply. "So often things tell read us, I hear somehow I here, seem come right minute, make lessons easier. I never found lessons nice winter." "I do not like lessons," said Fergus. "I never shall like them." "You look upon necessary evils then," said his mother. "I usedn't like them," said Gratian. "_Now_ I often think I would like go till I am quite big." "Well, can, cannot you?" said Fergus. "No," Gratian replied; "boys like stop they are big enough help fathers home, I have big brother like Tony. I will stop going school long. I used think I would glad. Now I would sorry even I shepherd." "How mean?" asked lady. Gratian looked her his soft brown eyes. "I used think shepherd lying heather day--alone sheep Watch, like old Jonas--would best life any. But I want know things. I think one fancy better one knows more. And I would like fancy." "What would like do?" asked Fergus's mother. "Would like learn _make_ music well play it? That Fergus wants do." Gratian shook his head. "I do not know," he replied. "I do not know _yet_. And is not best plan it, I know father need farm?" "Perhaps best," she said. But she answered thinking something else time. And Andrew came help Fergus steps house, tea waiting library. Fergus's mother rather tired. She walked distance see poor woman ill afternoon. "Do not ask play much to-day, dear boys," she said. "I never like play much I tired; does not seem fair music." "Then shall not play all, mother darling," said Fergus. "Gratian, I will tell what; shall tell mother story. That rest her nicely." Gratian looked hesitatingly. "He tells nice stories," Fergus went on. "Does he often tell them?" asked lady. "Yes, alone," said Fergus. "The music makes think often," said Gratian. "It makes Fergus see pictures, makes think stories. Sometimes I see pictures too, I think I like stories best." "He made beauty day, Princess whose eyes forget-me-nots, whoever seen her could never forget her again; good people made happy, naughty people made unhappy--only good somehow end. Gratian made come right." "That sounds pretty," said lady. "Did come music?" "No," said boy, "that story came mostly eyes. I called lady forget-me-not eyes first Sunday church." He spoke simply lady could help smiling. "My eyes thank pretty thoughts them," she said. "Will tell story again?" "No," Fergus interrupted. "I want new one. You one ready to-day, Gratian." "I little one, I tell it, like," said Gratian. "It is not exactly like story. There is not anything wonderful like one Princess, one underground fairies." "No, _was_ beauty," said Fergus. "But never mind one is not quite nice," he added, condescendingly. So Gratian began. "It sea-gull," he said. "You know them, course, sea. This little, young sea-gull. It long learnt fly, sea-gulls need fly well, often go many miles without rest sea, unless happens ship passing rock standing water, even bunch seaweed floating--that might young bird heavy. There stormy weather year sea-gull his brothers sisters hatched, sometimes father mother sea-gulls quite frightened let try fly, fear beaten storm winds strength rise again. It quite different, see, little land-birds learning fly. They flutter little way one twig another near ground, fall cannot much hurt. Sea-gulls need brave hearts even quite little. This sea-gull brave, almost brave. He loved sea dearly he still nestling, peeping his home, high ledge rock, dancing, flashing waves below, he longed among them. He felt he almost would go mad joy his mother would let dash her, whirling curving air, nothing great ocean. And he would scarcely believe her his father told was not easy fly looked--not beginning, birds learn degrees. At last one day father, sniffing about, came told mother would good day beginning. So four young ones got ready, stood edge nest great excitement. I think must funny see first--they awkward clumsy. But did not hurt themselves--for old birds kept first among rocks could not fall far. And sea-gull was not quite sure next day, quite impatient go flying, I daresay he got better he become less conceited. When could fly little better father mother took little bay, nice soft sand, wind blew gently, got well. And content stay till spring storms wings grown stronger. They quite content except one I telling of." "What his name?" asked Fergus. "He has not got one," Gratian replied, "but make one. I daresay would better." "Call White-wings," said Fergus. "No," said Gratian, "that will not do," though he did not say why. "Besides his wings were not white. We will call 'Quiver,' he always quivering impatience. Well, quite content except Quiver, he discontented. He looked longingly sea, wishing midst flocks birds he saw sparkling sunshine; last one morning his father mother gone good fly themselves, well deserved, poor things, trouble little ones, he stood nest, flapping his impatient wings, said three others he going his account. The brothers sisters begged not, use--off he would go, he hurry see world feel independent. Well, he got pretty well first; sea far out, several rocks sticking he could rest on, he found easy he tempted fly farther he intended, going one rock other. And he did not notice far he gone till he resting rock good way out, looking round he could not tell bit he was, nothing sea round him. He could not think become points rocks--they seemed disappeared. But he beginning feel rather frightened number gulls flew lighted rock. They chattering excited. "'We must make haste,' said, 'and get shore fast storm us. And must shelter till get back rocks.' "They rested moment two, got ready start again. Quiver stood flapped his wings attract attention. "'May I fly you?' he said. 'I am afraid I do not quite know way.' "They looked surprise. "'What away home--a young fledgling like you?' said. 'Come us like, it is chance, you will probably never get shore.' "Oh frightened he was, he wished he would stayed home! But he flew away them, was, said, his chance, he suffered something dreadful. And last he reached shore, drop lie sands gasping bruised, and, he thought, dying. A man passing, hurry get home storm, picked poor Quiver, half pity, half he thought his little master might like his feathers he died, make pet he lived. And Quiver, quite fainting time, woke find lying little sort tool-house garden, boy big you, Fergus, stooping him. "'I do not think he is going die,' boy said. 'I have made bed hay corner--to-morrow we will see he is.' "Poor Quiver felt strange queer sad. It took several days get better, he did not like food gave him, though course meant kind. At last, one day he able hop even flap his wings little. "'Now I shall soon able fly home again,' he thought joyfully. 'If I get sea I will sure meet gulls show way.' "And boy came look him, he pleased hear said quite well again. "'We let garden now, cannot we?' he said gardener, 'and we will see he is good slug catcher say.' "'No fear he is that, sir,' said gardener. 'But first must clip his wings, else he would flying away.' "And he took Quiver his arms, stretching his wings, though hurt them, snipped big sharp pair scissors. Quiver did not feel it, feel nails cut, he dreadfully frightened. And he still shaking confused gardener set garden path--though he got better minute looked him. It pretty garden, he pleased air again, though he felt something strange it, he never away sea. And he ran steps try his legs, turned round meaning say good-bye boy thank his sea-gull way his hospitality starting off. Having done he stretched his wings fly--but--oh dear, matter? He could raise inches ground--wings!--he none left, pitiful cry he rolled ground misery despair. "'Poor bird!' said boy; 'you should not clipped his wings, Barnes. It would better let fly away.' "'He would never got his home; he is young bird fly far. And he will uncommon good slugs, you will see, sir.' "So summer poor Quiver spent garden. He got used while, still he always pain his heart. He used rush along paths he desperate hurry eager get end, he would rush back again. It way he could keep his impatience his longing sea. He used pretend he got end path he would feel salt air see waves dancing; children house, course did not understand his thoughts, used laugh call 'that absurd creature.' But his heart sore mind, even catching slugs little consolation him. "And Quiver lived summer autumn till winter came round again, time whenever his wings began grow longer, Barnes snipped short again. I do not think ever bird severely punished discontent impatience. "The winter dreadfully cold one; frost long time nothing seemed alive all--there worm slug insect kind garden. The little boy his brothers sisters went away began get cold, went, told Barnes he must leave Quiver garden; he must shut winter large poultry house cocks hens. "'For there is nothing eat outside, might forget feed him, know,' children said. "So Quiver passed winter safely, though sadly enough. He plenty eat, one teased ill-used him, he used sometimes almost _choke_ his longing freedom fresh air--above all, air sea. He know long winter lasted; he still young bird, he often felt he would die he kept prisoner much longer. But he bear it, he did not die, he grew last patient one would thought he discontented bird. There little yard covered netting outside hen-house, Quiver could see sky there; clouds scudding along windy day reminded little waves he feared he would never see again; stupid, peaceful cocks hens used wonder he found stare hours together. _They_ thought far interesting thing life poke ground corn thrown them. "At last--at last--came spring. It came little bits time course, Quiver could not understand made everything feel different, sky looked blue again, till one day gardener's wife, managed poultry, opened door covered yard let out, Quiver, thinner quicker hens, slipped past her got garden. She saw he got there, she thought right--he might begin his slug-catching again. And he hurried along path his old way, feeling thankful free, longing his heart, stronger ever. It long since he tried fly least he forgotten almost he wings, he went hurrying along his legs. All sudden something startled him--a noise trees something like that--and without thinking he doing, he stretched his wings old way. But fancy his surprise; instead flopping lopping done long, ever since Barnes cut them, stood firm steady, quite able support his weight; he tried again, again, and--it mistake--up he soared, up, up, up, clear spring sky, strong free fearless, his wings grown again! That long dull winter; happiness came poor Quiver last, he learnt wait." "And he fly home?" asked Fergus breathlessly; "did he find his father mother others old nest among rocks?" "Yes," replied Gratian, moment's consideration, "he met gulls his way sea, told exactly go. And he find home. You know, generally, bird families do not stay long together, gulls unhappy Quiver fixed stay close old ones till he came back. They always kept hoping he would come back." "I glad," said Fergus sigh relief. "How beautiful must feel sea-wind again, see waves dancing sunshine! Do know, Gratian, I little afraid end going say Quiver grown good he went 'up, up, up,' straight heaven. I should not liked that--at least till he lived happily sea first. And then," Fergus began get little confused, "I do not know that. _Do_ gulls go heaven, mother? You do not mind thinking dogs do." The lady smiled. She said anything yet; she seemed thinking seriously. But she drew Gratian her kissed his forehead. "Thank you, dear boy," she said. "I glad heard one stories." CHAPTER XI. DRAWN TWO WAYS "When Love wants this, Pain wants that, And hearts want Tit Tat." MATTHEW BROWNE Gratian almost danced along moor path his way home evening; he felt happy. Never he loved Fergus his mother much--he could understand he ever lived without them, like child he think he ever _could_ so. He let future take care itself. It cold course. He rather fancied White-wings far off, twice he stood still listen. It little time since he heard anything his friends. But first nothing met his ear, he ran on. Suddenly breath--a waft rather soft air blew his face. It White-wings, certainly Gray-wings. Gratian looked surprise--he could hardly expect soft western sister cold night. "Yes, I," she said; "you hardly believe it, you? I passing by--no one else know I here. I do not generally come merry spirits--I do not feel need then. But I far off, I thought I would give kiss way. So told sea-gull's story--I glad liked it." "Yes," said Gratian, "they did, indeed. But, Green-wings, I am glad you have come, I wanted ask you, ask I made myself, I say? I am afraid telling is not true; know I could not explain others. I could not I tried." "You meant so," replied she quickly. "What said Fergus asked stories?" "I said I could not explain I knew them--that sometimes sort dream. I did not want say I made myself, though I _partly_ made them--you know I have, Green-wings." "Certainly--it I instance, told remarkable fact natural history related end story?" said Green-wings her soft laugh. "You may quite take credit that. But I will not laugh you, dear. It true stories, yet sort dream. No one could hear them--no one would say whispers wind talking language you, anything reflection pretty fancies. It right--you see. But I must go," she gave little sigh. "Green-wings, darling, seem little sad to-night," said Gratian. "Why it? Is winter come?" "I never merry, know. But I little sadder usual to-night. I foresee--I foresee sorrows"--and her voice breathed words exquisite plaintiveness sounded like dying away notes dirge. "But keep heart, darling, trust us all--all four. We wish good, though may show different ways. And wherever I I always comfort you, moment. No distance separate us child." "And I _your_ child, I not, dear Green-wings?" asked Gratian. "I knew first, I think I love most." "My darling, good-night," whispered Green-wings, soft flutter she gone. There mother waiting open door Gratian's return evening. "It cold standing outside now," he said he went in, adding aloud, "Here I am, mother. Did think I late?" Mrs. Conyfer sitting fire. Her knitting lay her knee, her hands idle. She looked Gratian came in. "I glad come, dear," she said; her voice sounded tired, he close her he saw her face seemed tired also. "Are well, mother?" he said gently. Mrs. Conyfer looked little surprised pleased too. It new her either think she asked it. For though her husband kind good, he plain even little rough, moorland people general. Gratian never rough, he habit much noticing him. Since he often Fergus lady he learnt observant others, especially his mother, tender his manner. "Are well, mother dear?" he repeated. "I am bit tired, boy," she said. "I am getting old, I suppose, I have worked pretty hard way--not say I would poor man's wife course, farmer's wife deal her mind." "And everything well, mother," said Gratian admiringly. "I am getting old enough see different things many houses. Fergus like hear dairy cocks hens, girdle cakes nice things make." "He is really nice little gentleman!" said Mrs. Conyfer, well pleased, "I _am_ glad hear he is getting much better. I am sure his mother deserves he should--such sweet lady she is." For Sunday two boys' mothers spoken other. "Yes, he is _much_ better," said Gratian. "To-day he walked six times terrace arm." "They were not afraid let out, cold to-day?" said Mrs. Conyfer. "It was not cold--you usedn't mind cold, mother," said boy. "Maybe much now," she replied. "I think I am getting rheumatic like father mother me, I cannot move quick, one feels cold more." "What makes people rheumatics?" asked Gratian. "Folk do not much hereabout," his mother answered; "but I do not belong moor country, know. My home way this, valley, it is milder much damper--and damp worst anything rheumatism. Dear me, I remember old grandmother perfect sight it--all doubled up--you wondered she got about. But she marvel patience, cheery too. I hope I shall like her that, I live long, it is sore trial active nature become nearly helpless." "Had she nobody kind her she got ill?" asked Gratian. "Oh yes; her children good her, far could be. But married world, busy families. She good deal alone, poor old grandmother." "Mother," said Gratian quickly. "If ever got like that, I would never marry go world. I would stay home comfort you. I would run messages everything I could you. Mother, I wish you would let use already, even though you are ill." Mrs. Conyfer smiled, pleasure amusement her smile. "I think Big House done good, Gratian. You never used notice think things much went there," she said. "And you are getting handy, there is doubt. I hope I shall never laid aside, I am sure you would best, dear. Now I think I shall go bed, must too. Father's still--he Jonas much see cold nights, seeing creatures warm sheltered. There is snow far off, saying. The wind's north." Gratian's dreams grotesque night. He dreamt his mother turned sea-gull, except her face, remained same. And she could neither walk fly, she lame stiff, else her wings cut--he sure which. Then he heard Green-wings's voice saying, "She wants sight sea make her well. Gratian, take her sea; call cocks hens help you;" he thought he opened his eyes found terrace he walking Fergus, beautiful little carriage drawn dozen cocks hens; he would got in, Fergus seemed push back, saying, "Not yet, yet, mother first," Fergus kept looking Mrs. Conyfer he know she poor sea-gull, standing looking funny little red knitted shawl Gratian's mother wore chilly morning. And came flying above, Gratian's four friends. Nobody seemed see himself, cocks hens began making noise he felt quite confused. "Oh, take poor mother," he called out--for use trying make one else understand--"Green-wings you, take poor mother." "Not without you, Gratian," replied Gray-wings's sharp voice. "It is place look mother," she spoke she stooped towards he felt her cold breath, start gave he awoke. The door his room blown open, window rattling, clothes slipped one side. No wonder he dreamt he cold. He covered went sleep. Mrs. Conyfer usual next morning. She said she better, she limped little she walked, Gratian like see it, though she assured hurt her. "I shall take rest Sunday," she said, "and may tend bit, Gratian. He is handy girl," she added, turning farmer smile. And Mr. Conyfer patted his son's head. "That is right," he said; "always good mother." "Winter really coming," thought Gratian, he ran school, he glanced sky wondering snow last way. It held however little time yet. It third day Gratian his way home rather surprised meet Mr. Cornelius returning Farm. The school-children knew master somewhere, he left school charge one two head boys his sister, lived taught girls sewing. He smiled nodded Gratian, speak, boy could help wondering he Four Winds, why. And soon he got home he ran eagerly ask. "Has master here, mother? What he come for?" he called out. His father mother together kitchen, talking rather earnestly. His father looked he answered-- "Yes, Gratian," he said, "Mr. Cornelius here. He something important talk us about. After tea done lessons tell you." "I have not lessons, father," he replied. "We time afternoon master out." So soon tea he told was. "Your friends Big House," began farmer, "are leaving soon. They dare not stay gets really cold. You will sorry lose them, boy?" Gratian felt lump rise his throat, he tried answer cheerfully. "Yes, father. They have good me. I knew they would go time, I tried think it. The lady taught many things I never knew before. I will try forget them." "She good you, she wants still more. That is Cornelius came about. I do not want make vain, Gratian, she thinks, Cornelius thinks--and know--that there is making something common you--that, taught trained right way, may come something good bit higher plain moorland farmer." Gratian listened wide-opened eyes. "I know," he said breathlessly, "I have felt sometimes. I do not rightly know what. I would like learn--I would like to----oh, father, I cannot say I mean. It is many thoughts I cannot say," child leaned his head his mother's shoulder burst tears. The farmer his wife looked other. They simple unlettered folk, something "understood." "My boy, little Gratian," said mother, tones she seldom used; "do not cry, dear. Listen father." And moment two child raised his still tearful eyes, farmer went on. "It is that," he said. "It is cannot rightly say, want learn. No one tell yet talent may be, perhaps not, speak, everyday one all. If so, harm done; wise hands, come home Four Winds follow father's grandfather's steps. But friends think better chance learning seeing I give here. And lady written her husband, he is quite willing, it is, speak, settled. You go leave here, Gratian, year lessons home little boy, is not yet strong enough go school. And end time it will easier see best fitted for. You will teaching kinds--music drawing, sorts book-learning. It is handsome offer, there is denying." And tears quite disappeared Gratian's bright eyes, his whole face glowed hope satisfaction. "I will best, father. I promise that. You shall call ashamed me. It is good mother let go. But I shall come home long--I shall not long without seeing you?" "Oh yes--you shall come home course. Anyway visit, see best do. We are going give away altogether, may sure," said farmer little attempt joke. But mother speak. She kissed boy she rarely kissed him, whispered "God bless you, dear," she bade good-night. "I wonder it is come giving outlandish name!" said Mrs. Conyfer rather melancholy smile. And Gratian fell asleep his mind whirl. "I like talk godmothers," almost his last thought. "I wonder I shall still see sometimes I far Four Winds." And next morning he woke, he lay looking round his little room thinking much he liked it, happy he it. He beginning realise good good, light without shadow. But seemed shadow drawback kind next day he went Big House talk lady Fergus. Fergus delighted words. "It like story book, is not it, Gratian?" he said. "And turn great man, world thank mother found you." Gratian blushed little. "I do not know _great_ man," he said, "but I want find really I best, fault I do not _something_ good." "Yes, boy--that exactly I want feel," said Fergus's mother. But Gratian anxious know his four friends say it. "I do not think it is kind none come speak me," he said aloud his way home. "I know you are far off--all you. I am sure I heard Gray-wings scolding outside last night." A sound faint laughter seemed answer. "Oh are, Gray-wings, I thought much," he said, buttoning his jacket, cold. But he hardly spoken he heard, nearer laughter been, soft sigh. "I never forget you--remember, Gratian, whenever want me--whenever sor--row." "That is Green-wings," he said himself. "But she talk sorrow I am happy--happier ever life, I think. She _is_ rather melancholy nature." He ran on--the door latched--he hurried kitchen. There one there. "Where mother be?" he thought. He heard steps moving upstairs turned go there. Halfway he met Madge, servant, coming down. Her face looked anxious distressed rosiness. "Oh poor missis," she said. "She is go bed. The pains her ankles knees got bad--I am afeared she is going really ill." Gratian ran past her his mother's room. "Do not frightened," Mrs. Conyfer said once. "It is rheumatism bad to-day. I will better morning, dear. I must well going away soon." And farmer came she met cheerful tone, though evident she suffering severely. But Gratian sat her bedside evening, he could. He grave silent, thought deep his heart-- "I cannot go away--I cannot I must not mother going really ill. Poor mother! I am sure godmothers would not think I should." CHAPTER XII. LEARNING TO WAIT "If beauty earth And skies hearts men Were gently gathered birth, And loved born again." MATTHEW BROWNE But godmothers seemed forgotten him. He went sadly bed--and tears came his eyes he remembered evening he thought "happier he ever his life." He fell asleep however one nine years old, whatever troubles one has, slept soundly hours. Then he awakened his door opening one coming in. It his father. "Gratian, wake up. Your mother ill I am afraid. Some one must go doctor--old Jonas nearest. I cannot leave her--she seems nearly unconscious. Dress quick can, tell Jonas bring Dr. Spense soon possible." Gratian dressed almost once. He felt giddy miserable, yet strange feeling he known before. He dared try think clearly--he dared face terrible fear bottom his heart. It his first experience real trouble. As he hurried he met Madge door; she wakened up. A sudden thought struck him. "Madge," he said, "if I am back quickly, tell father frightened. I think I will go way doctor myself. It will save time go waking old Jonas, I know he could not go fast I can." Madge looked admiringly yet half-anxiously boy. He seemed little fellow go way alone dark winter night. "I daresay you are right," she said, "and yet I am half-afraid. Had not better ask master first?" Gratian shook his head. "No, no. It right. Do not trouble unless he asks," he ran. He went quickly he could find his way--it _very_ dark night--till he fairly moorland path. Then he stood still. "White-wings, Green-wings--whichever hears me, come help me. Dear Green-wings, said always would comfort me." "So she would, surely," said voice, firmer colder hers, kindly too, "but moment it is strength comfort want. Hold arms, boy, there--clasp tight, do not start cold breath. That is right. Why, I fly snow-flake!" And Gratian felt strange, whirling, rushing sensation, he closed his eyes he falling asleep, knew till he found standing village street, doors doctor's house, felt, rather heard, clear cold whisper "Farewell, Gratian, present." And next morning neighbours spoke sudden northern blast come rushing moors night, wondered brought snow it, little thinking brought little boy instead! Dr. Spense soon awakened, long time always seems anxious watcher sick-bed, Farmer Conyfer could scarcely believe his ears he heard rattle dogcart wheels steep road, his eyes doctor, followed Gratian, came staircase. "My boy, done bravely!" said father amazement. "Doctor, I cannot understand he quick!" The doctor turned kindly Gratian. "Go down, good child, warm yourself. I saw sparkle nice fire kitchen--it bitter night. I keep promise you; I go away I will look in." For Gratian, though able tell much his mother's illness, begged doctor promise tell truth he thought her. "I would rather know, sir, I would indeed, even it is bad," he said tremblingly. And he sat kitchen fire waiting, seemed never till he least understood he loved his mother. It queer, boisterous night surely. For chimney, well-built well-seasoned was, came sudden swirl wind. But strangely enough make fire smoke. And Gratian, anxious though he was, smiled pretty green light seemed suddenly dance among flames. And he neither surprised startled soft voice whispered his ear: "I here, darling. I _would_ come one moment, though White-wings trying blow away. Keep heart--and do not lose hope." And doctor came in. "My boy," he said, he stood warming his hands blaze, "I tell truth. I afraid poor mother going ill good while. She taken care herself. But I good hopes she recover. And may good deal. I see sensible, handy, I sure. You must instead daughter her while--it hard father, may great help." Gratian thanked him, tears, would kept back, his eyes. And promising come day, past midnight, doctor went away. Some days passed--the fever high first, poor Mrs. Conyfer suffered much. But almost sooner doctor ventured hope, she began get little better. Within week she danger. And came Fergus's mother again. She already come ask news her little friend's mother, first great anxiety she said nothing plans made. But she asked see farmer, talked time downstairs Gratian watched his mother. "I thankful better--so thankful better go, Gratian," said poor woman. "Oh yes, dear mother, cannot thankful enough," boy replied. "I never forget night--the night ill," he said shiver thought it. "I shall able write much you, child," she said. "The doctor says hands joints stiff good while, I must try fret, keep easy mind. I try--but will not easy that is always stirring. And I shall miss first, course. But you are well happy--and would sad dull different." Just farmer's voice came sounding stairs. "Gratian," said, "come here." The boy obeyed. But first he stooped kissed pale face pillow. "Dear mother," he said. His father standing kitchen fire he went in, lady seated one big old arm-chairs. She looked fresh love interest her sweet blue eyes. "Dear Gratian," she said, "Fergus fretting sadly. Your father telling clever sick-nurse are. And indeed I sure way Fergus. I very, glad dear mother better." "She miss good deal first, I am afraid," said farmer, "but I must best. It is going, boy--the lady already put days sake. It is good you, madam--_very_ good. I will get ready well I can. You will excuse his things shipshape order his mother would them." "Of course, course," she replied. "Then day to-morrow. I _daren't_ wait longer--the doctor says Fergus must risk cold yet." Gratian listened silence. But he turned, first his father lady, spoke. "Father, dear lady," he began, "do not vexed me--oh do not. But I cannot go now. I have thought days--I am--I am _dreadfully_ sorry," his voice faltered. "I wanted learn understand. But would not right. I know would not. Mother would get well quick without me, perhaps she would never get well all. And learning seeing things would really good I knew I was not right. Father--tell think I am right." The lady farmer looked other; tears lady's eyes. "Is he right?" asked Gratian's father. She bent her head. "I am afraid he is," she said, "but fair let quite understand. It is not merely putting while, Gratian," she went on; "I afraid may altogether. We likely come back part country again, husband, though kind, little peculiar. He nephew he send companion Fergus do not come. We like better, duty something Jack, Fergus needs companion, seems natural take instead sending away school." "Of course," said farmer, looking his son. "Yes, I understand," said Gratian. "But does not make difference. If I never learnt anything more--of learning, I mean--if I never left Four Winds saw beautiful places things world, _shouldn't_ make difference. I could not ever happy or--or--do anything really good great," he went on, blushing little, "if I began wrong--could I?" "He right," said his father Fergus's mother together. And settled. The person difficult satisfy he _was_ right was--no, Fergus--sorry he he loved his mother much agree--poor Mrs. Conyfer herself, sacrifice made. Gratian talk her ever long, assure her his sake well--that he would miserable her got good his new opportunities. And end she gave in, allowed herself enjoy comfort her little boy's care companionship her long weary time slow recovery. Fergus his mother leave day soon. With early January winter spirits, chained hitherto, broke forth fury. Never falls snow known even wild region, many night Gratian, lying awake, unable sleep rattle racket, felt strange excitement thought work his mysterious protectors. "White-wings Gray-wings seem really going mad," he thought twice. But sound laughter, mingling whistling roaring shrieking chimney, reassured him. "No fear, fear," he seemed hear; "we must let spirits sometimes. But you would better go school day two, small Gratian, same." And several "days two" winter impossible go school, one come Farm, heavy dark even mid-day storm-clouds, deep lay treacherous snow-drifts. Not even doctor could reach them. But fortunately Mrs. Conyfer time much better. All she required care rest. "Oh, mother dear, glad I I leave you!" Gratian would often say. "How dull dreary long days would seemed! You could not even got letters me." And lessons he learnt winter patient waiting, quiet watching self-forgetfulness, bore fruit. And his four friends forget him. There came soft breath two gentle sisters whose voices hushed others time, mysterious way Gratian felt summoned lonely moorland two whose carnival time was. And standing great sweep open country around him, his hair tossed White-wings's giant touch, his cheeks tingling sharp blast mischievous Gray-wings, Gratian laughed pleasure daring enjoyment. "I child too--Spirits North East. You cannot frighten me. I defy you." And two laughed shouted wild glee foster-child's great spirit. "He us credit," cried, though old Jonas passing heard nothing shriek fresh fury above, shouted Gratian hasten within shelter. But winter never lasts ever. Spring came again--slow reluctant--and long Gray-wings consented take her yearly nap let her sister west soothe comfort storm-tossed country. And then, day day Gratian made his way school, he watched awakened ever-awaking eyes exquisite eternal beauty summer's gradual approach, till last Golden-wings clasped her arms one morning told her joy able return. "For I love country, though one believe it," she said. "The scent gorse heather delicious refreshing strong spice perfumes home;" many story she told child, many song she sang long summer days--which he loved spend his old way, among heather Jonas Watch browsing sheep. For holidays begun. His mother well, quite well, now, Gratian free he chose. He moors one day--a lovely cloudless day, would sultry anywhere else--when old Jonas startled saying suddenly: "Did know, Master Gratian, gentry's come back Big House?" Gratian sat straight his astonishment. "No, Jonas. How hear it?" "Down village, quite sudden-like. It got ready last week, there is none us much lately." Gratian felt excited lie still dream more. [Illustration: It Fergus, little lame Fergus, mounted tiny rough-coated pony, coming towards him!] "I will ask mother I may go see," he said jumping up. And he ran. But unexpected sight met stone's throw Farm. It Fergus, little lame Fergus, mounted tiny rough-coated pony, coming towards him! And joy meeting could describe? "We tried keep secret till quite sure," said boy. "There difficulty it, settled now. Father taken Big House cousin, live half year. We there--my sisters--and big brother comes sometimes--and mother course. All except Jack. Jack gone sea. He nice, he hated lessons--he wanted go sea. So want now, Gratian--my Gratian.

"But I shall get strong I live beautiful air. And I shall happy, I learn play organ--and makes all." And came Fergus said. The summer autumn followed, Gratian studied his friend's tutor. And winter after, greatly his mother's joy, he went away planned before. But ever course. No great length time passed without his returning his birthplace. "I die," he said sometimes, "if I could time time stand old porch feel breath four winds me." This story opening life boy lived make his mark among men. How he so, he found his voice, tell. But he early learnt choose right, know he prospered. Besides--was he godchild Four Winds Heaven? THE END.
