 THE WATER BABIES CHAPTER I “I heard thousand blended notes, While grove I sate reclined; In sweet mood pleasant thoughts Bring sad thoughts mind. “To her fair works Nature link The human soul ran; And much grieved heart think, What man made man.” WORDSWORTH. ONCE upon time little chimney-sweep, his name Tom. That short name, heard before, much trouble remembering it. He lived great town North country, plenty chimneys sweep, plenty money Tom earn his master spend. He could read write, care either; he never washed himself, water court he lived. He never taught say his prayers. He never heard God, Christ, except words never heard, would well he never heard. He cried half his time, laughed half. He cried he climb dark flues, rubbing his poor knees elbows raw; soot got his eyes, every day week; his master beat him, he every day week; he enough eat, happened every day week likewise. And he laughed half day, he tossing halfpennies boys, playing leap-frog posts, bowling stones horses’ legs trotted by, last excellent fun, wall hand behind hide. As chimney-sweeping, hungry, beaten, he took way world, like rain snow thunder, stood manfully his back till over, his old donkey hail-storm; shook his ears jolly ever; thought fine times coming, he would man, master sweep, sit public-house quart beer long pipe, play cards silver money, wear velveteens ankle-jacks, keep white bull-dog one gray ear, carry her puppies his pocket, like man. And he would apprentices, one, two, three, he could. How he would bully them, knock about, his master him; make carry home soot sacks, he rode his donkey, pipe his mouth flower his button-hole, like king head his army. Yes, good times coming; and, his master let pull leavings his beer, Tom jolliest boy whole town. One day smart little groom rode court Tom lived. Tom hiding behind wall, heave half brick his horse’s legs, custom country welcome strangers; groom saw him, halloed know Mr. Grimes, chimney-sweep, lived. Now, Mr. Grimes Tom’s master, Tom good man business, always civil customers, he put half-brick quietly behind wall, proceeded take orders. Mr. Grimes come next morning Sir John Harthover’s, Place, his old chimney-sweep gone prison, chimneys wanted sweeping. And he rode away, giving Tom time ask sweep gone prison for, matter interest Tom, he prison twice himself. Moreover, groom looked neat clean, his drab gaiters, drab breeches, drab jacket, snow-white tie smart pin it, clean round ruddy face, Tom offended disgusted his appearance, considered stuck-up fellow, gave airs he wore smart clothes, people paid them; went behind wall fetch half-brick all; not, remembering he come way business, was, were, flag truce. His master delighted his new customer he knocked Tom hand, drank beer night he usually two, order sure getting time next morning; man’s head aches he wakes, glad he turn out, breath fresh air. And, he get four next morning, he knocked Tom again, order teach (as young gentlemen used taught public schools) he must extra good boy day, going great house, might make good thing it, could give satisfaction. And Tom thought likewise, and, indeed, would done behaved his best, even without knocked down. For, places upon earth, Harthover Place (which he never seen) wonderful, and, men earth, Sir John (whom he seen, sent gaol twice) awful. Harthover Place really grand place, even rich North country; house large frame-breaking riots, Tom could remember, Duke Wellington, ten thousand soldiers match, easily housed therein; least, Tom believed; park full deer, Tom believed monsters habit eating children; miles game-preserves, Mr. Grimes collier lads poached times, occasions Tom saw pheasants, wondered tasted like; noble salmon-river, Mr. Grimes his friends would liked poach; must got cold water, like all. In short, Harthover grand place, Sir John grand old man, even Mr. Grimes respected; could he send Mr. Grimes prison he deserved it, he twice week; he land miles; he jolly, honest, sensible squire, ever kept pack hounds, would he thought right his neighbours, well get he thought right himself; but, more, he weighed full fifteen stone, nobody knew many inches round chest, could thrashed Mr. Grimes fair fight, folk round could do, which, dear little boy, would right do, great many things one do, would like much do. So Mr. Grimes touched his hat he rode town, called “buirdly awd chap,” his young ladies “gradely lasses,” two high compliments North country; thought made his poaching Sir John’s pheasants; whereby may perceive Mr. Grimes properly-inspected Government National School. Now, I dare say, never got three of the clock midsummer morning. Some people get want catch salmon; want climb Alps; great many must, like Tom. But, I assure you, three of the clock midsummer morning pleasantest time twenty-four hours, three hundred sixty-five days; every one get then, I never could tell, save determined spoil nerves complexions night might well day. But Tom, instead going dinner half-past eight night, ball ten, finishing somewhere twelve four, went bed seven, his master went public-house, slept like dead pig; reason he piert game-cock (who always gets early wake maids), ready get fine gentlemen ladies ready go bed. So he his master set out; Grimes rode donkey front, Tom brushes walked behind; court, street, past closed window-shutters, winking weary policemen, roofs shining gray gray dawn. They passed pitmen’s village, shut silent now, turnpike; real country, plodding along black dusty road, black slag walls, sound groaning thumping pit-engine next field. But soon road grew white, walls likewise; wall’s foot grew long grass gay flowers, drenched dew; instead groaning pit-engine, heard skylark saying his matins high air, pit-bird warbling sedges, he warbled night long. All else silent. For old Mrs. Earth still fast asleep; and, like many pretty people, she looked still prettier asleep awake. The great elm-trees gold-green meadows fast asleep above, cows fast asleep beneath them; nay, clouds fast asleep likewise, tired lain earth rest, long white flakes bars, among stems elm-trees, along tops alders stream, waiting sun bid rise go day’s business clear blue overhead. On went; Tom looked, looked, he never far country before; longed get gate, pick buttercups, look birds’ nests hedge; Mr. Grimes man business, would heard that. Soon came poor Irishwoman, trudging along bundle her back. She gray shawl her head, crimson madder petticoat; may sure she came Galway. She neither shoes stockings, limped along she tired footsore; she tall handsome woman, bright gray eyes, heavy black hair hanging her cheeks. And she took Mr. Grimes’ fancy much, he came alongside he called her: “This hard road gradely foot like that. Will ye up, lass, ride behind me?” But, perhaps, she admire Mr. Grimes’ look voice; she answered quietly: “No, thank you: I would sooner walk little lad here.” “You may please yourself,” growled Grimes, went smoking. So she walked beside Tom, talked him, asked he lived, he knew, himself, till Tom thought he never met pleasant-spoken woman. And she asked him, last, whether he said his prayers! seemed sad he told her he knew prayers say. Then he asked her she lived, she said far away sea. And Tom asked her sea; she told rolled roared rocks winter nights, lay still bright summer days, children bathe play it; many story more, till Tom longed go see sea, bathe likewise. At last, bottom hill, came spring; spring see here, soaks white gravel bog, among red fly-catchers, pink bottle-heath, sweet white orchis; one may see, too, here, bubbles warm sandbank hollow lane great tuft lady ferns, makes sand dance reels bottom, day night, year round; spring either those; real North country limestone fountain, like one Sicily Greece, old heathen fancied nymphs sat cooling hot summer’s day, shepherds peeped behind bushes. Out low cave rock, foot limestone crag, great fountain rose, quelling, bubbling, gurgling, clear could tell water ended air began; ran away road, stream large enough turn mill; among blue geranium, golden globe-flower, wild raspberry, bird-cherry tassels snow. And Grimes stopped, looked; Tom looked too. Tom wondering whether anything lived dark cave, came night fly meadows. But Grimes wondering all. Without word, he got his donkey, clambered low road wall, knelt down, began dipping his ugly head spring—and dirty he made it. Tom picking flowers fast he could. The Irishwoman helped him, showed tie up; pretty nosegay made them. But he saw Grimes actually wash, he stopped, quite astonished; Grimes finished, began shaking his ears dry them, he said: “Why, master, I never saw before.” “Nor again, likely. ’Twasn’t cleanliness I it, coolness. I would ashamed want washing every week so, like smutty collier lad.” “I wish I might go dip head in,” said poor little Tom. “It must good putting town-pump; beadle drive chap away.” “Thou come along,” said Grimes; “what dost want washing thyself? Thou drink half gallon beer last night, like me.” “I do not care you,” said naughty Tom, ran stream, began washing his face. Grimes sulky, woman preferred Tom’s company his; he dashed horrid words, tore his knees, began beating him. But Tom accustomed that, got his head safe Mr. Grimes’ legs, kicked his shins his might. “Are ashamed yourself, Thomas Grimes?” cried Irishwoman wall. Grimes looked up, startled her knowing his name; he answered was, “No, never yet;” went beating Tom. “True you. If ever ashamed yourself, would gone Vendale long ago.” “What know Vendale?” shouted Grimes; he left beating Tom. “I know Vendale, you, too. I know, instance, happened Aldermire Copse, night, two years ago come Martinmas.” “You do?” shouted Grimes; leaving Tom, he climbed wall, faced woman. Tom thought he going strike her; she looked full fierce face that. “Yes; I there,” said Irishwoman quietly. “You Irishwoman, speech,” said Grimes, many bad words. “Never mind I am. I saw I saw; strike boy again, I tell I know.” Grimes seemed quite cowed, got his donkey without another word. “Stop!” said Irishwoman. “I one word both; see over. Those wish clean, clean be; wish foul, foul be. Remember.” And she turned away, gate meadow. Grimes stood still moment, like man stunned. Then he rushed her, shouting, “You come back.” But he got meadow, woman there. Had she hidden away? There place hide in. But Grimes looked about, Tom also, he puzzled Grimes her disappearing suddenly; look would, she there. Grimes came back again, silent post, he little frightened; and, getting his donkey, filled fresh pipe, smoked away, leaving Tom peace. And gone three miles more, came Sir John’s lodge-gates. Very grand lodges were, grand iron gates stone gate-posts, top dreadful bogy, teeth, horns, tail, crest Sir John’s ancestors wore Wars Roses; prudent men wear it, enemies must run lives first sight them. Grimes rang gate, came keeper spot, opened. “I told expect thee,” he said. “Now thou’lt good keep main avenue, let find hare rabbit thee thou comest back. I shall look sharp one, I tell thee.” “Not it is bottom soot-bag,” quoth Grimes, he laughed; keeper laughed said: “If that is thy sort, I may well walk thee hall.” “I think thou best had. It is thy business see thy game, man, mine.” So keeper went them; and, Tom’s surprise, he Grimes chatted together way quite pleasantly. He know keeper poacher turned outside in, poacher keeper turned inside out. They walked great lime avenue, full mile long, stems Tom peeped trembling horns sleeping deer, stood among ferns. Tom never seen enormous trees, he looked he fancied blue sky rested heads. But he puzzled much strange murmuring noise, followed way. So much puzzled, last he took courage ask keeper was. He spoke civilly, called Sir, he horribly afraid him, pleased keeper, he told bees lime flowers. “What bees?” asked Tom. “What make honey.” “What honey?” asked Tom. “Thou hold thy noise,” said Grimes. “Let boy be,” said keeper. “He is civil young chap now, that is he will long he bides thee.” Grimes laughed, he took compliment. “I wish I keeper,” said Tom, “to live beautiful place, wear green velveteens, real dog-whistle button, like you.” The keeper laughed; he kind-hearted fellow enough. “Let well alone, lad, ill times. Thy life’s safer mine events, eh, Mr. Grimes?” And Grimes laughed again, two men began talking, quite low. Tom could hear, though, poaching fight; last Grimes said surlily, “Hast thou anything me?” “Not now.” “Then do not ask questions till thou hast, I man honour.” And laughed again, thought good joke. And time come great iron gates front house; Tom stared rhododendrons azaleas, flower; house itself, wondered many chimneys it, long ago built, man’s name built it, whether he got much money his job? These last difficult questions answer. For Harthover built ninety different times, nineteen different styles, looked somebody built whole street houses every imaginable shape, stirred together spoon. _For attics Anglo-Saxon_. _The third door Norman_. _The second Cinque-cento_. _The first-floor Elizabethan_. _The right wing Pure Doric_. _The centre Early English_, _with huge portico copied Parthenon_. _The left wing pure Bœotian_, _which country folk admired all_, _became like new barracks town_, _only three times big_. _The grand staircase copied Catacombs Rome_. _The back staircase Tajmahal Agra_. _This built Sir John’s great-great-great-uncle_, _who won_, _in Lord Clive’s Indian Wars_, _plenty money_, _plenty wounds_, _and taste his betters_. _The cellars copied caves Elephanta_. _The offices Pavilion Brighton_. And rest nothing heaven, earth, earth. So Harthover House great puzzle antiquarians, thorough Naboth’s vineyard critics, architects, persons like meddling men’s business, spending men’s money. So setting upon poor Sir John, year year, trying talk spending hundred thousand pounds so, building, please himself. But he always put off, like canny North-countryman he was. One wanted build Gothic house, he said he Goth; another build Elizabethan, he said he lived good Queen Victoria, good Queen Bess; another bold enough tell his house ugly, he said he lived inside it, outside; another, unity it, he said he liked old place. For he liked see Sir John, Sir Hugh, Sir Ralph, Sir Randal, left his mark upon place, his taste; he notion disturbing his ancestors’ work disturbing graves. For house looked like real live house, history, grown grown world grew; upstart fellow know his grandfather was, would change spick span new Gothic Elizabethan thing, looked bad spawned night, mushrooms are. From may collect (if wit enough) Sir John sound-headed, sound-hearted squire, man keep country side order, show good sport his hounds. But Tom his master go great iron gates, Dukes Bishops, round back way, long way round was; little back-door, ash-boy let in, yawning horribly; passage housekeeper met them, flowered chintz dressing-gown, Tom mistook her My Lady herself, she gave Grimes solemn orders “You take care this, take care that,” he going chimneys, Tom. And Grimes listened, said every then, his voice, “You will mind that, little beggar?” Tom mind, least he could. And housekeeper turned grand room, covered sheets brown paper, bade begin, lofty tremendous voice; whimper two, kick his master, grate Tom went, chimney, housemaid stayed room watch furniture; Mr. Grimes paid many playful chivalrous compliments, met slight encouragement return. How many chimneys Tom swept I cannot say; he swept many he got quite tired, puzzled too, like town flues he accustomed, would find—if would get look, perhaps would like do—in old country-houses, large crooked chimneys, altered again, till ran one another, anastomosing (as Professor Owen would say) considerably. So Tom fairly lost his way them; he cared much that, though he pitchy darkness, he much home chimney mole underground; last, coming he thought right chimney, he came wrong one, found standing hearthrug room like he never seen before. Tom never seen like. He never gentlefolks’ rooms carpets up, curtains down, furniture huddled together cloth, pictures covered aprons dusters; he often enough wondered rooms like ready quality sit in. And he saw, he thought sight pretty. The room dressed white,—white window-curtains, white bed-curtains, white furniture, white walls, lines pink there. The carpet gay little flowers; walls hung pictures gilt frames, amused Tom much. There pictures ladies gentlemen, pictures horses dogs. The horses he liked; dogs he care much, bull-dogs among them, even terrier. But two pictures took his fancy were, one man long garments, little children mothers round him, laying his hand upon children’s heads. That pretty picture, Tom thought, hang lady’s room. For he could see lady’s room dresses lay about. The picture man nailed cross, surprised Tom much. He fancied he seen something like shop-window. But there? “Poor man,” thought Tom, “and he looks kind quiet. But lady sad picture her room? Perhaps kinsman hers, murdered savages foreign parts, she kept remembrance.” And Tom felt sad, awed, turned look something else. The next thing he saw, puzzled him, washing-stand, ewers basins, soap brushes, towels, large bath full clean water—what heap things washing! “She must dirty lady,” thought Tom, “by master’s rule, want much scrubbing that. But she must cunning put dirt way well afterwards, I do not see speck room, even towels.” And then, looking toward bed, he saw dirty lady, held his breath astonishment. Under snow-white coverlet, upon snow-white pillow, lay beautiful little girl Tom ever seen. Her cheeks almost white pillow, her hair like threads gold spread bed. She might old Tom, maybe year two older; Tom think that. He thought her delicate skin golden hair, wondered whether she real live person, one wax dolls he seen shops. But he saw her breathe, he made his mind she alive, stood staring her, she angel heaven. No. She cannot dirty. She never could dirty, thought Tom himself. And he thought, “And people like washed?” And he looked his wrist, tried rub soot off, wondered whether ever would come off. “Certainly I look much prettier then, I grew like her.” And looking round, he suddenly saw, standing close him, little ugly, black, ragged figure, bleared eyes grinning white teeth. He turned angrily. What little black ape want sweet young lady’s room? And behold, himself, reflected great mirror, like Tom never seen before. And Tom, first time his life, found he dirty; burst tears shame anger; turned sneak chimney hide; upset fender threw fire-irons down, noise ten thousand tin kettles tied ten thousand mad dogs’ tails. Up jumped little white lady her bed, and, seeing Tom, screamed shrill peacock. In rushed stout old nurse next room, seeing Tom likewise, made her mind he come rob, plunder, destroy, burn; dashed him, he lay fender, fast she caught jacket. But she hold him. Tom policeman’s hands many time, too, more; he would ashamed face his friends ever he stupid enough caught old woman; he doubled good lady’s arm, across room, window moment. He need drop out, though he would done bravely enough. Nor even let spout, would old game him; he got spout church roof, he said take jackdaws’ eggs, policeman said steal lead; and, he seen high, sat till sun got hot, came another spout, leaving policemen go back stationhouse eat dinners. But window spread tree, great leaves sweet white flowers, almost big his head. It magnolia, I suppose; Tom knew nothing that, cared less; tree he went, like cat, across garden lawn, iron railings park towards wood, leaving old nurse scream murder fire window. The gardener, mowing, saw Tom, threw his scythe; caught his leg it, cut his shin open, whereby he kept his bed week; his hurry he never knew it, gave chase poor Tom. The dairymaid heard noise, got churn her knees, tumbled it, spilling cream; yet she jumped up, gave chase Tom. A groom cleaning Sir John’s hack stables let go loose, whereby he kicked lame five minutes; he ran gave chase Tom. Grimes upset soot-sack new-gravelled yard, spoilt utterly; he ran gave chase Tom. The old steward opened park-gate hurry, he hung his pony’s chin upon spikes, and, aught I know, hangs still; he jumped off, gave chase Tom. The ploughman left his horses headland, one jumped fence, pulled ditch, plough all; he ran on, gave chase Tom. The keeper, taking stoat trap, let stoat go, caught his finger; he jumped up, ran Tom; considering he said, he looked, I sorry Tom he caught him. Sir John looked his study window (for he early old gentleman) nurse, marten dropped mud his eye, he last send doctor; yet he ran out, gave chase Tom. The Irishwoman, too, walking house beg,—she must got round byway—but she threw away her bundle, gave chase Tom likewise. Only Lady give chase; she put her head window, her night-wig fell garden, she ring her lady’s-maid, send her privately, quite put her running, she came nowhere, consequently placed. In word, never heard Hall Place—not even fox killed conservatory, among acres broken glass, tons smashed flower-pots—such noise, row, hubbub, babel, shindy, hullabaloo, stramash, charivari, total contempt dignity, repose, order, day, Grimes, gardener, groom, dairymaid, Sir John, steward, ploughman, keeper, Irishwoman, ran park, shouting, “Stop thief,” belief Tom least thousand pounds’ worth jewels his empty pockets; magpies jays followed Tom up, screaking screaming, he hunted fox, beginning droop his brush. And poor Tom paddled park his little bare feet, like small black gorilla fleeing forest. Alas him! big father gorilla therein take his part—to scratch gardener’s inside one paw, toss dairymaid tree another, wrench Sir John’s head third, he cracked keeper’s skull his teeth easily cocoa-nut paving-stone. However, Tom remember ever father; he look one, expected take care himself; running, he could keep couple miles stage-coach, chance copper cigar-end, turn coach-wheels his hands feet ten times following, do. Wherefore his pursuers found difficult catch him; hope catch all. Tom, course, made woods. He never wood his life; he sharp enough know he might hide bush, swarm tree, and, altogether, chance open. If he known that, he would foolisher mouse minnow. But he got wood, he found different sort place he fancied. He pushed thick cover rhododendrons, found caught trap. The boughs laid hold his legs arms, poked his face his stomach, made shut his eyes tight (though great loss, he could see best yard his nose); he got rhododendrons, hassock-grass sedges tumbled over, cut his poor little fingers afterwards spitefully; birches birched soundly he nobleman Eton, face (which fair swishing brave boys agree); lawyers tripped up, tore his shins sharks’ teeth—which lawyers likely enough have. “I must get this,” thought Tom, “or I shall stay till somebody comes help me—which I do not want.” But get difficult matter. And indeed I do not think he would ever got all, stayed till cock-robins covered leaves, he suddenly run his head wall. Now running head wall pleasant, especially loose wall, stones set edge, sharp cornered one hits eyes makes see manner beautiful stars. The stars beautiful, certainly; unfortunately go twenty-thousandth part split second, pain comes not. And Tom hurt his head; he brave boy, mind penny. He guessed wall cover would end; he went, like squirrel. And he was, great grouse-moors, country folk called Harthover Fell—heather bog rock, stretching away up, sky. Now, Tom cunning little fellow—as cunning old Exmoor stag. Why not? Though he ten years old, he lived longer stags, wits start bargain. He knew well stag, he backed he might throw hounds out. So first thing he he wall make neatest double sharp his right, run along wall nearly half mile. Whereby Sir John, keeper, steward, gardener, ploughman, dairymaid, hue-and-cry together, went ahead half mile opposite direction, inside wall, leaving mile outside; Tom heard shouts die away woods chuckled merrily. At last he came dip land, went bottom it, he turned bravely away wall moor; he knew he put hill his enemies, could go without seeing him. But Irishwoman, alone all, seen way Tom went. She kept ahead every one whole time; yet she neither walked ran. She went along quite smoothly gracefully, her feet twinkled past fast could see foremost; till every one asked strange woman was; agreed, want anything better say, she must league Tom. But she came plantation, lost sight her; could less. For she went quietly wall Tom, followed wherever he went. Sir John rest saw her; sight mind. And Tom right away heather, moor bred, except rocks stones lying everywhere, that, instead moor growing flat he went upwards, grew broken hilly, rough little Tom could jog along well enough, find time, too, stare strange place, like new world him. He saw great spiders there, crowns crosses marked backs, sat middle webs, saw Tom coming, shook fast became invisible. Then he saw lizards, brown gray green, thought snakes, would sting him; much frightened he, shot away heath. And then, rock, he saw pretty sight—a great brown, sharp-nosed creature, white tag her brush, round her four five smutty little cubs, funniest fellows Tom ever saw. She lay her back, rolling about, stretching her legs head tail bright sunshine; cubs jumped her, ran round her, nibbled her paws, lugged her tail; she seemed enjoy mightily. But one selfish little fellow stole away rest dead crow close by, dragged hide it, though nearly big he was. Whereat his little brothers set full cry, saw Tom; ran back, jumped Mrs. Vixen, caught one her mouth, rest toddled her, dark crack rocks; end show. And next he fright; for, he scrambled sandy brow—whirr-poof-poof-cock-cock-kick—something went his face, horrid noise. He thought ground blown up, end world come. And he opened his eyes (for he shut tight) old cock-grouse, washing sand, like Arab, want water; who, Tom trodden him, jumped noise like express train, leaving his wife children shift themselves, like old coward, went off, screaming “Cur-ru-you-uck, cur-ru-you-uck—murder, thieves, fire—cur-you-uck-cock-kick—the end world come—kick-kick-cock-kick.” He always fancying end world come, anything happened farther end his nose. But end world come, twelfth August was; though old grouse-cock quite certain it. So old grouse came back his wife family hour afterwards, said solemnly, “Cock-cock-kick; dears, end world quite come; I assure coming day to-morrow—cock.” But his wife heard often she knew it, little more. And, besides, she mother family, seven little poults wash feed every day; made her practical, little sharp-tempered; she answered was: “Kick-kick-kick—go catch spiders, go catch spiders—kick.” So Tom went on, he hardly knew why; he liked great wide strange place, cool fresh bracing air. But he went slowly he got higher hill; ground grew bad indeed. Instead soft turf springy heather, he met great patches flat limestone rock, like ill-made pavements, deep cracks stones ledges, filled ferns; he hop stone stone, he slipped between, hurt his little bare toes, though tolerably tough ones; still he would go up, he could tell why. What would Tom said he seen, walking moor behind him, Irishwoman taken his part upon road? But whether he looked little behind him, whether she kept sight behind rocks knolls, he never saw her, though she saw him. And he began get little hungry, thirsty; he run long way, sun risen high heaven, rock hot oven, air danced reels it, limekiln, till everything round seemed quivering melting glare. But he could see nothing eat anywhere, still less drink. The heath full bilberries whimberries; flower yet, June. And water; find top limestone rock? Now he passed deep dark swallow-hole, going earth, chimney dwarfs house underground; once, he passed, he could hear water falling, trickling, tinkling, many many feet below. How he longed get it, cool his poor baked lips! But, brave little chimney-sweep he was, he dared climb chimneys those. So he went on, till his head spun round heat, he thought he heard church-bells ringing long way off. “Ah!” he thought, “where church houses people; and, perhaps, one give bit sup.” So he set again, look church; he sure he heard bells quite plain. And minute more, he looked round, he stopped again, said, “Why, big place world is!” And was; for, top mountain he could see—what could he see? Behind him, far below, Harthover, dark woods, shining salmon river; his left, far below, town, smoking chimneys collieries; far, far away, river widened shining sea; little white specks, ships, lay bosom. Before lay, spread like map, great plains, farms, villages, amid dark knots trees. They seemed his feet; he sense see long miles away. And his right rose moor moor, hill hill, till faded away, blue blue sky. But moors, really his feet, lay something, which, soon Tom saw it, he determined go, place him. A deep, deep green rocky valley, narrow, filled wood; wood, hundreds feet him, he could see clear stream glance. Oh, he could get stream! Then, stream, he saw roof little cottage, little garden set squares beds. And tiny little red thing moving garden, bigger fly. As Tom looked down, he saw woman red petticoat. Ah! perhaps she would give something eat. And church-bells ringing again. Surely must village there. Well, nobody would know him, happened Place. The news could got yet, even Sir John set policemen county him; he could get five minutes. Tom quite right hue-and-cry got thither; he come without knowing it, best part ten miles Harthover; he wrong getting five minutes, cottage mile off, good thousand feet below. However, he went; like brave little man he was, though he footsore, tired, hungry, thirsty; church-bells rang loud, he began think must inside his head, river chimed tinkled far below; song sang:— _Clear cool_, _clear cool_, _By laughing shallow_, _and dreaming pool_; _Cool clear_, _cool clear_, _By shining shingle_, _and foaming wear_; _Under crag ouzel sings_, _And ivied wall church-bell rings_, _Undefiled_, _for undefiled_; _Play me_, _bathe me_, _mother child_. _Dank foul_, _dank foul_, _By smoky town murky cowl_; _Foul dank_, _foul dank_, _By wharf sewer slimy bank_; _Darker darker farther I go_, _Baser baser richer I grow_; _Who dares sport sin-defiled_? _Shrink me_, _turn me_, _mother child_. _Strong free_, _strong free_, _The floodgates open_, _away sea_, _Free strong_, _free strong_, _Cleansing streams I hurry along_, _To golden sands_, _and leaping bar_, _And taintless tide awaits afar_. _As I lose infinite main_, _Like soul sinned pardoned again_. _Undefiled_, _for undefiled_; _Play me_, _bathe me_, _mother child_. So Tom went down; he never saw Irishwoman going behind him. CHAPTER II “And care heaven? love In heavenly spirits creatures base That may compassion evils move? There is:—else much wretched case Of men beasts: But oh! exceeding grace Of Highest God loves His creatures so, And His works mercy doth embrace, That blessed Angels He sends fro, To serve wicked man, serve His wicked foe!” SPENSER. A MILE off, thousand feet down. So Tom found it; though seemed he could chucked pebble back woman red petticoat weeding garden, even across dale rocks beyond. For bottom valley one field broad, side ran stream; it, gray crag, gray down, gray stair, gray moor walled heaven. A quiet, silent, rich, happy place; narrow crack cut deep earth; deep, way, bad bogies hardly find out. The name place Vendale; want see yourself, must go High Craven, search Bolland Forest north Ingleborough, Nine Standards Cross Fell; found it, must turn south, search Lake Mountains, Scaw Fell sea; then, found it, must go northward merry Carlisle, search Cheviots across, Annan Water Berwick Law; then, whether found Vendale not, found country, people, ought make proud British boy. So Tom went go down; first he went three hundred feet steep heather, mixed loose brown grindstone, rough file; pleasant his poor little heels, he came bump, stump, jump, steep. And still he thought he could throw stone garden. Then he went three hundred feet lime-stone terraces, one other, straight carpenter ruled his ruler cut his chisel. There heath there, but— First, little grass slope, covered prettiest flowers, rockrose saxifrage, thyme basil, sorts sweet herbs. Then bump two-foot step limestone. Then another bit grass flowers. Then bump one-foot step. Then another bit grass flowers fifty yards, steep house-roof, he slide his dear little tail. Then another step stone, ten feet high; he stop himself, crawl along edge find crack; he rolled over, he would rolled right old woman’s garden, frightened her her wits. Then, he found dark narrow crack, full green-stalked fern, hangs basket drawing-room, crawled it, knees elbows, he would chimney, another grass slope, another step, on, till—oh, dear me! I wish over; he. And yet he thought he could throw stone old woman’s garden. At last he came bank beautiful shrubs; white-beam great silver-backed leaves, mountain-ash, oak; cliff crag, cliff crag, great beds crown-ferns wood-sedge; shrubs he could see stream sparkling, hear murmur white pebbles. He know three hundred feet below. You would giddy, perhaps, looking down: Tom not. He brave little chimney-sweep; he found top high cliff, instead sitting crying his baba (though he never baba cry for), he said, “Ah, suit me!” though he tired; he went, stock stone, sedge ledge, bush rush, he born jolly little black ape, four hands instead two. And he never saw Irishwoman coming behind him. But he getting terribly tired now. The burning sun fells sucked up; damp heat woody crag sucked still more; perspiration ran ends his fingers toes, washed cleaner he whole year. But, course, he dirtied everything, terribly he went. There great black smudge crag ever since. And black beetles Vendale since ever known before; all, course, owing Tom’s blacked original papa all, he setting married, sky-blue coat scarlet leggins, smart gardener’s dog polyanthus his mouth. At last he got bottom. But, behold, bottom—as people usually find coming mountain. For foot crag heaps heaps fallen limestone every size head stage-waggon, holes full sweet heath-fern; Tom got them, he bright sunshine again; he felt, suddenly, people generally do, he b-e-a-t, beat. You must expect beat times life, little man, live life man ought live, let strong healthy may: are, find ugly feeling. I hope day may stout staunch friend beat; for, not, best lie are, wait better times, poor Tom did. He could get on. The sun burning, yet he felt chill over. He quite empty, yet he felt quite sick. There two hundred yards smooth pasture cottage, yet he could walk it. He could hear stream murmuring one field beyond it, yet seemed hundred miles off. He lay grass till beetles ran him, flies settled his nose. I do not know he would got again, gnats midges taken compassion him. But gnats blew trumpets loud his ear, midges nibbled his hands face wherever could find place free soot, last he woke up, stumbled away, low wall, narrow road, cottage-door. And neat pretty cottage was, clipped yew hedges round garden, yews inside too, cut peacocks trumpets teapots kinds queer shapes. And open door came noise like frogs Great-A, know going scorching hot to-morrow—and know I do not know, do not know, nobody knows. He came slowly open door, hung round clematis roses; peeped in, half afraid. And sat empty fireplace, filled pot sweet herbs, nicest old woman ever seen, her red petticoat, short dimity bedgown, clean white cap, black silk handkerchief it, tied her chin. At her feet sat grandfather cats; opposite her sat, two benches, twelve fourteen neat, rosy, chubby little children, learning Chris-cross-row; gabble enough made it. Such pleasant cottage was, shiny clean stone floor, curious old prints walls, old black oak sideboard full bright pewter brass dishes, cuckoo clock corner, began shouting soon Tom appeared: frightened Tom, eleven of the clock. All children started Tom’s dirty black figure,—the girls began cry, boys began laugh, pointed rudely enough; Tom tired care that. “What art thou, dost want?” cried old dame. “A chimney-sweep! Away thee! I will sweeps here.” “Water,” said poor little Tom, quite faint. “Water? There is plenty i’ beck,” she said, quite sharply. “But I cannot get there; I am clemmed hunger drought.” And Tom sank upon door-step, laid his head post. And old dame looked her spectacles one minute, two, three; she said, “He is sick; bairn’s bairn, sweep none.” “Water,” said Tom. “God forgive me!” she put her spectacles, rose, came Tom. “Water’s bad thee; I will give thee milk.” And she toddled next room, brought cup milk bit bread. Tom drank milk one draught, looked up, revived. “Where didst come from?” said dame. “Over Fell, there,” said Tom, pointed sky. “Over Harthover? Lewthwaite Crag? Art sure thou art lying?” “Why I?” said Tom, leant his head post. “And got ye there?” “I came Place;” Tom tired desperate he heart time think story, he told truth words. “Bless thy little heart! And thou hast stealing, then?” “No.” “Bless thy little heart! I will warrant not. Why, God’s guided bairn, he innocent! Away Place, Harthover Fell, Lewthwaite Crag! Who ever heard like, God had not led him? Why dost eat thy bread?” “I cannot.” “It is good enough, I made myself.” “I cannot,” said Tom, he laid his head his knees, asked— “Is Sunday?” “No, then; be?” “Because I hear church-bells ringing so.” “Bless thy pretty heart! The bairn’s sick. Come wi’ me, I will hap thee somewhere. If thou wert bit cleaner I would put thee bed, Lord’s sake. But come along here.” But Tom tried get up, he tired giddy she help lead him. She put outhouse upon soft sweet hay old rug, bade sleep his walk, she would come school over, hour’s time. And she went again, expecting Tom fall fast asleep once. But Tom fall asleep. Instead he turned tossed kicked strangest way, felt hot he longed get river cool himself; he fell half asleep, dreamt he heard little white lady crying him, “Oh, you are dirty; go washed;” he heard Irishwoman saying, “Those wish clean, clean be.” And he heard church-bells ring loud, close too, he sure must Sunday, spite old dame said; he would go church, see church like inside, he never one, poor little fellow, his life. But people would never let come in, soot dirt like that. He must go river wash first. And he said loud again, though half asleep he know it, “I must clean, I must clean.” And sudden he found himself, outhouse hay, middle meadow, road, stream him, saying continually, “I must clean, I must clean.” He got his legs, sleep awake, children often get bed, go room, quite well. But he bit surprised, went bank brook, lay grass, looked clear, clear limestone water, every pebble bottom bright clean, little silver trout dashed fright sight his black face; he dipped his hand found cool, cool, cool; he said, “I fish; I swim water; I must clean, I must clean.” So he pulled his clothes haste he tore them, easy enough ragged old things. And he put his poor hot sore feet water; his legs; farther he went in, church-bells rang his head. “Ah,” said Tom, “I must quick wash myself; bells ringing quite loud now; stop soon, door shut, I shall never able get all.” Tom mistaken: England church doors left open service time, everybody likes come in, Churchman Dissenter; ay, even he Turk Heathen; man dared turn out, long he behaved quietly, good old English law would punish man, he deserved, ordering peaceable person God’s house, belongs alike. But Tom know that, he knew great deal people ought know. And he never saw Irishwoman, behind time, before. For he came river side, she stept cool clear water; her shawl her petticoat floated her, green water-weeds floated round her sides, white water-lilies floated round her head, fairies stream came bottom bore her away upon arms; she Queen all; perhaps besides. “Where been?” asked her. “I smoothing sick folks’ pillows, whispering sweet dreams ears; opening cottage casements, let stifling air; coaxing little children away gutters, foul pools fever breeds; turning women gin-shop door, staying men’s hands going strike wives; I help help themselves: little enough is, weary work me. But I brought new little brother, watched safe way here.” Then fairies laughed joy thought little brother coming. “But mind, maidens, he must see you, know here. He savage now, like beasts perish; beasts perish he must learn. So must play him, speak him, let see you: keep harmed.” Then fairies sad, could play new brother, always told. And Queen floated away river; whither she went, thither she came. But Tom, course, never saw heard: perhaps he would made little difference story; hot thirsty, longed clean once, he tumbled quick he could clear cool stream. And he two minutes he fell fast asleep, quietest, sunniest, cosiest sleep ever he his life; he dreamt green meadows he walked morning, tall elm-trees, sleeping cows; he dreamt nothing all. The reason his falling delightful sleep simple; yet hardly one found out. It merely fairies took him. Some people think fairies. Cousin Cramchild tells little folks his Conversations. Well, perhaps none—in Boston, YOU.S., he raised. There clumsy lot spirits there, cannot make people hear without thumping table: get living thereby, I suppose want. And Aunt Agitate, her Arguments political economy, says none. Well, perhaps none—in her political economy. But wide world, little man—and thank Heaven it, else, crinolines theories, us would get squashed—and plenty room fairies, without people seeing them; unless, course, look right place. The wonderful strongest things world, know, things one see. There life you; life makes grow, move, think: yet cannot see it. And steam steam-engine; makes move: yet cannot see it; may fairies world, may makes world go round old tune “_C’est l’amour_, _l’amour_, _l’amour_ _Qui fait la monde à la ronde_:” yet one may able see except whose hearts going round tune. At events, make believe fairies world. It last time many one shall make believe. And yet, all, need that. There must fairies; fairy tale: one fairy tale fairies? You do not see logic that? Perhaps not. Then please see logic great many arguments exactly like it, hear beard gray. The kind old dame came back twelve, school over, look Tom: Tom there. She looked his footprints; ground hard slot, say dear old North Devon. And grow brave healthy man, may know day slot means, know too, I hope, slot mean—a broad slot, blunt claws, makes man put his cigar, set his teeth, tighten his girths, he sees it; his rights mean, he them, brow, bay, tray, points; see something worth seeing Haddon Wood Countisbury Cliff, good Mr. Palk Collyns show way, mend bones fast smash them. Only jolly day comes, please do not break neck; stogged mire never be, I trust; heath-cropper bred born. So old dame went quite sulky, thinking little Tom tricked her false story, shammed ill, run away again. But she altered her mind next day. For, Sir John rest run breath, lost Tom, went back again, looking foolish. And looked foolish still Sir John heard story nurse; foolish still, again, heard whole story Miss Ellie, little lady white. All she seen poor little black chimney-sweep, crying sobbing, going get chimney again. Of course, she much frightened: wonder. But all. The boy taken nothing room; mark his little sooty feet, could see he never hearthrug till nurse caught hold him. It mistake. So Sir John told Grimes go home, promised five shillings he would bring boy quietly him, without beating him, he might sure truth. For he took granted, Grimes too, Tom made his way home. But Tom came back Mr. Grimes evening; he went police-office, tell look boy. But Tom heard of. As his gone great fells Vendale, dreamed his gone moon. So Mr. Grimes came Harthover next day sour face; he got there, Sir John hills far away; Mr. Grimes sit outer servants’ hall day, drink strong ale wash away his sorrows; washed away long Sir John came back. For good Sir John slept badly night; he said his lady, “My dear, boy must got grouse-moors, lost himself; he lies heavily conscience, poor little lad. But I know I do.” So, five next morning he got, his bath, his shooting-jacket gaiters, stableyard, like fine old English gentleman, face red rose, hand hard table, back broad bullock’s; bade bring his shooting pony, keeper come his pony, huntsman, first whip, second whip, under-keeper bloodhound leash—a great dog tall calf, colour gravel-walk, mahogany ears nose, throat like church-bell. They took place Tom gone wood; hound lifted his mighty voice, told he knew. Then he took place Tom climbed wall; shoved down, got through. And wise dog took moor, fells, step step, slowly; scent day old, know, light heat drought. But cunning old Sir John started five morning. And last he came top Lewthwaite Crag, he bayed, looked faces, much say, “I tell he gone here!” They could hardly believe Tom would gone far; looked awful cliff, could never believe he would dared face it. But dog said so, must true. “Heaven forgive us!” said Sir John. “If find all, shall find lying bottom.” And he slapped his great hand upon his great thigh, said— “Who go Lewthwaite Crag, see boy alive? Oh I twenty years younger, I would go myself!” And he would done, well sweep county. Then he said— “Twenty pounds man brings boy alive!” his way, he said he meant. Now among lot little groom-boy, little groom indeed; he ridden court, told Tom come Hall; he said— “Twenty pounds none, I go Lewthwaite Crag, it is poor boy’s sake. For he civil spoken little chap ever climbed flue.” So Lewthwaite Crag he went: smart groom he top, shabby one bottom; he tore his gaiters, he tore his breeches, he tore his jacket, he burst his braces, he burst his boots, he lost his hat, worst all, he lost his shirt pin, he prized much, gold, he raffle Malton, figure top it, t’ould mare, noble old Beeswing herself, natural life; really severe loss: he never saw anything Tom. And Sir John rest riding round, full three miles right, back again, get Vendale, foot crag. When came old dame’s school, children came see. And old dame came too; she saw Sir John, she curtsied low, she tenant his. “Well, dame, you?” said Sir John. “Blessings broad back, Harthover,” says she—she did not call Sir John, Harthover, fashion North country—“and welcome Vendale: you are hunting fox time year?” “I hunting, strange game too,” said he. “Blessings heart, makes look sad morn?” “I am looking lost child, chimney-sweep, run away.” “Oh, Harthover, Harthover,” says she, “ye always man merciful; ye’ll harm poor little lad I give tidings him?” “Not I, I, dame. I am afraid hunted house miserable mistake, hound brought top Lewthwaite Crag, and—” Whereat old dame broke crying, without letting finish his story. “So he told truth all, poor little dear! Ah, first thoughts best, body’s heart’ll guide right, hearken it.” And she told Sir John all. “Bring dog here, lay on,” said Sir John, without another word, he set his teeth hard. And dog opened once; went away back cottage, road, meadow, bit alder copse; there, upon alder stump, saw Tom’s clothes lying. And knew much need know. And Tom? Ah, comes wonderful part wonderful story. Tom, he woke, course he woke—children always wake slept exactly long good them—found swimming stream, four inches, or—that I may accurate—3.87902 inches long round parotid region his fauces set external gills (I hope understand big words) like sucking eft, he mistook lace frill, till he pulled them, found he hurt himself, made his mind part himself, best left alone. In fact, fairies turned water-baby. A water-baby? You never heard water-baby. Perhaps not. That reason story written. There great many things world never heard of; great many nobody ever heard of; great many things, too, nobody ever hear of, least coming Cocqcigrues, man shall measure things. “But things water-babies.” How know that? Have see? And see, seen none, would prove none. If Mr. Garth find fox Eversley Wood—as folks sometimes fear he never will—that prove things foxes. And Eversley Wood woods England, waters know waters world. And one right say water-babies exist, till seen water-babies existing; quite different thing, mind, seeing water-babies; thing nobody ever did, perhaps ever do. “But surely water-babies, somebody would caught one least?” Well. How know somebody not? “But would put spirits, _Illustrated News_, perhaps cut two halves, poor dear little thing, sent one Professor Owen, one Professor Huxley, see would say it.” Ah, dear little man! follow all, see end story. “But water-baby contrary nature.” Well, but, dear little man, must learn talk things, grow older, different way that. You must talk “are not” “cannot” speak great wonderful world round you, wisest man knows smallest corner, is, great Sir Isaac Newton said, child picking pebbles shore boundless ocean. You must say cannot be, contrary nature. You know Nature is, she do; nobody knows; even Sir Roderick Murchison, Professor Owen, Professor Sedgwick, Professor Huxley, Mr. Darwin, Professor Faraday, Mr. Grove, great men good boys taught respect. They wise men; must listen respectfully say: even say, I sure never would, “That cannot exist. That contrary nature,” must wait little, see; perhaps even may wrong. It children read Aunt Agitate’s Arguments, Cousin Cramchild’s Conversations; lads go popular lectures, see man pointing big ugly pictures wall, making nasty smells bottles squirts, hour two, calling anatomy chemistry—who talk “cannot exist,” “contrary nature.” Wise men afraid say anything contrary nature, except contrary mathematical truth; two two cannot make five, two straight lines cannot join twice, part cannot great whole, (at least, seems present): wiser men are, less talk “cannot.” That rash, dangerous word, “cannot”; people use often, Queen Fairies, makes clouds thunder fleas bite, takes much trouble one other, apt astonish suddenly showing them, though say she cannot, yet she can, more, will, whether approve not. And therefore is, dozens hundreds things world certainly said contrary nature, see going eyes day long. If people never seen little seeds grow great plants trees, quite different shape themselves, trees produce fresh seeds, grow fresh trees, would said, “The thing cannot be; contrary nature.” And would quite right saying so, saying things cannot be. Or suppose again, come, like M. Du Chaillu, traveller unknown parts; human ever seen heard elephant. And suppose described people, said, “This shape, plan, anatomy beast, his feet, his trunk, his grinders, his tusks, though tusks all, two fore teeth run mad; section his skull, like mushroom reasonable skull reasonable unreasonable beast; forth, forth; though beast (which I assure I seen shot) first cousin little hairy coney Scripture, second cousin pig, (I suspect) thirteenth fourteenth cousin rabbit, yet he wisest beasts, everything save read, write, cast accounts.” People would surely said, “Nonsense; elephant contrary nature;” thought telling stories—as French thought Le Vaillant he came back Paris said he shot giraffe; king Cannibal Islands thought English sailor, he said his country water turned marble, rain fell feathers. They would tell you, knew science, “Your elephant impossible monster, contrary laws comparative anatomy, far yet known.” To would answer less, thought. Did learned men, too, hold, till within last twenty-five years, flying dragon impossible monster? And know hundreds found fossil world? People call Pterodactyles: ashamed call flying dragons, denying long flying dragons could exist. The truth is, folks’ fancy things cannot be, simply seen them, worth savage’s fancy cannot thing locomotive, he never saw one running wild forest. Wise men know business examine is, settle not. They know elephants; know flying dragons; wiser are, less inclined say positively water-babies. No water-babies, indeed? Why, wise men old said everything earth double water; may see is, quite true, still quite true theories likely hear many day. There land-babies—then water-babies? _Are water-rats_, _water-flies_, _water-crickets_, _water-crabs_, _water-tortoises_, _water-scorpions_, _water-tigers water-hogs_, _water-cats water-dogs_, _sea-lions sea-bears_, _sea-horses sea-elephants_, _sea-mice sea-urchins_, _sea-razors sea-pens_, _sea-combs sea-fans_; _and plants_, _are water-grass_, _and water-crowfoot_, _water-milfoil_, _and on_, _without end_? “But things nicknames; water things really akin land things.” That is always true. They are, millions cases, family, actually individual creatures. Do even know green drake, alder-fly, dragon-fly, live water till change skins, Tom changed his? And water animal continually change land animal, land animal sometimes change water animal? Do not put Cousin Cramchild’s arguments, stand like man, answer (quite respectfully, course) thus:— If Cousin Cramchild says, water-babies, must grow water-men, ask he knows not? then, he knows must, Proteus Adelsberg caverns grows perfect newt. If he says strange transformation land-baby turn water-baby, ask he ever heard transformation Syllis, Distomas, common jelly-fish, M. Quatrefages says excellently well—“Who would exclaim miracle come pass, he saw reptile come egg dropped hen his poultry-yard, reptile give birth indefinite number fishes birds? Yet history jelly-fish quite wonderful would be.” Ask he knows this; he not, tell go look himself; advise (very respectfully, course) settle strange things cannot happen, till he seen strange things happen every day. If he says things cannot degrade, is, change downwards lower forms, ask him, told water-babies lower land-babies? But even were, he know strange degradation common goose-barnacles, one finds sticking ships’ bottoms; still stranger degradation cousins theirs, one hardly likes talk, shocking ugly is? And, lastly, he says (as he certainly will) transformations take place lower animals, higher, say seems little boys, grown people, strange fancy. For changes lower animals wonderful, difficult discover, changes higher animals far wonderful, far difficult discover? And may man, crown flower things, undergo change much wonderful rest, Great Exhibition wonderful rabbit-burrow? Let answer that. And he says (as he will) seen change his experience, he bound believe it, ask respectfully, his microscope been? Does us, coming world, go transformation wonderful sea-egg, butterfly? reason analogy, well Scripture, tell us transformation last? that, though shall be, know not, yet crawling caterpillar, shall hereafter perfect fly. The old Greeks, heathens were, saw much two thousand years ago; I care little Cousin Cramchild, he sees even less they. And forth, forth, till he quite cross. And tell water-babies, least ought be; that, least, he cannot answer. And meanwhile, dear little man, till know great deal nature Professor Owen Professor Huxley put together, do not tell cannot be, fancy anything wonderful true. “We fearfully wonderfully made,” said old David; are; everything around us, deal table. Yes; much fearfully wonderfully made, already, table, stands now, nothing piece dead deal wood, if, foxes say, geese believe, spirits could make dance, talk rapping it. Am I earnest? Oh dear no! Do not know fairy tale, fun pretence; believe one word it, even true? But events, happened Tom. And, therefore, keeper, groom, Sir John made great mistake, unhappy (Sir John least) without reason, found black thing water, said Tom’s body, he drowned. They utterly mistaken. Tom quite alive; cleaner, merrier, he ever been. The fairies washed him, see, swift river, thoroughly, his dirt, his whole husk she will washed quite him, pretty little real Tom washed inside it, swam away, caddis case stones silk bored through, away goes back, paddling shore, split skin, fly away caperer, four fawn-coloured wings, long legs horns. They foolish fellows, caperers, fly candle night, leave door open. We hope Tom wiser, he got safe his sooty old she will. But good Sir John understand this, fellow Linnæan Society; he took his head Tom drowned. When looked empty pockets his she will, found jewels there, money—nothing three marbles, brass button string it—then Sir John something like crying ever he his life, blamed bitterly he need done. So he cried, groom-boy cried, huntsman cried, dame cried, little girl cried, dairymaid cried, old nurse cried (for somewhat her fault), lady cried, though people wigs, reason hearts; keeper cry, though he good-natured Tom morning before; he dried running poachers, could get tears milk leather: Grimes cry, Sir John gave ten pounds, he drank week. Sir John sent, far wide, find Tom’s father mother: he might looked till Doomsday them, one dead, Botany Bay. And little girl would play her dolls whole week, never forgot poor little Tom. And soon lady put pretty little tombstone Tom’s she will little churchyard Vendale, old dalesmen sleep side side lime-stone crags. And dame decked garlands every Sunday, till she grew old she could stir abroad; little children decked it, her. And always she sang old old song, she sat spinning she called her wedding-dress. The children could understand it, liked none less that; sweet, sad; enough them. And words it:— _When world young_, _lad_, _And trees green_; _And every goose swan_, _lad_, _And every lass queen_; _Then hey boot horse_, _lad_, _And round world away_; _Young blood must course_, _lad_, _And every dog his day_. _When world old_, _lad_, _And trees brown_; _And sport stale_, _lad_, _And wheels run down_; _Creep home_, _and take place there_, _The spent maimed among_: _God grant find one face there_, _You loved young_. Those words: body it: soul song dear old woman’s sweet face, sweet voice, sweet old air she sang; that, alas! one cannot put paper. And last she grew stiff lame, angels forced carry her; helped her her wedding-dress, carried her Harthover Fells, long way beyond too; new schoolmistress Vendale, hope she certificated. And Tom swimming river, pretty little lace-collar gills his neck, lively grig, clean fresh-run salmon. Now do not like story, go schoolroom learn multiplication-table, see like better. Some people, doubt, would so. So much better us, them. It takes sorts, say, make world. CHAPTER III “He prayeth well loveth well Both men bird beast; He prayeth best loveth best All things great small: For dear God loveth us, He made loveth all.” COLERIDGE. TOM quite amphibious. You know means? You better, then, ask nearest Government pupil-teacher, may possibly answer smartly enough, thus— “Amphibious. Adjective, derived two Greek words, _amphi_, fish, _bios_, beast. An animal supposed ignorant ancestors compounded fish beast; therefore, like hippopotamus, cannot live land, dies water.” However may be, Tom amphibious: better still, he clean. For first time his life, he felt comfortable nothing himself. But he enjoyed it: he know it, think it; enjoy life health, yet never think alive healthy; may long think it! He remember ever dirty. Indeed, he remember his old troubles, tired, hungry, beaten, sent dark chimneys. Since sweet sleep, he forgotten his master, Harthover Place, little white girl, word, happened he lived before; best all, he forgotten bad words he learned Grimes, rude boys he used play. That strange: know, came world, became land-baby, remembered nothing. So he, he became water-baby? Then lived before? My dear child, tell? One tell that, remembering something happened lived before; remember nothing, know nothing it; book, man, ever tell us certainly. There wise man once, wise man, good man, wrote poem feelings children lived before; he said— “_Our birth sleep forgetting_; _The soul rises us_, _our life’s star_, _Hath elsewhere setting_, _And cometh afar_: _Not entire forgetfulness_, _And utter nakedness_, _But trailing clouds glory_, _do come_ _From God_, _who home_.” There, know that. But I you, I would believe that. For great fairy Science, likely queen fairies many year come, good, never harm; instead fancying people, body makes soul, steam-engine could make coke; or, people, soul nothing body, stuck like pin pincushion, fall first shake;—you believe one true, _orthodox_, _inductive_, _rational_, _deductive_, _philosophical_, _seductive_, _logical_, _productive_, _irrefragable_, _salutary_, _nominalistic_, _comfortable_, _realistic_, _and on-all-accounts-to-be-received_ doctrine wonderful fairy tale; is, soul makes body, snail makes his she will. For rest, enough us sure whether lived before, shall live again; though not, I hope, poor little heathen Tom did. For he went downward water: we, I hope, shall go upward different place. But Tom happy water. He sadly overworked land-world; now, make that, he nothing holidays water-world long, long time come. He nothing enjoy himself, look pretty things seen cool clear water-world, sun never hot, frost never cold. And he live on? Water-cresses, perhaps; perhaps water-gruel, water-milk; many land-babies likewise. But know one-tenth water-things eat; answerable water-babies. Sometimes he went along smooth gravel water-ways, looking crickets ran among stones, rabbits land; he climbed ledges rock, saw sand-pipes hanging thousands, every one pretty little head legs peeping out; he went still corner, watched caddises eating dead sticks greedily would eat plum-pudding, building houses silk glue. Very fanciful ladies were; none would keep materials day. One would begin pebbles; she would stick piece green wood; she found she will, stuck too; poor she will alive, like taken build houses with: caddis let voice matter, rude selfish, vain people apt be; she stuck piece rotten wood, smart pink stone, on, till she patched like Irishman’s coat. Then she found long straw, five times long herself, said, “Hurrah! sister tail, I will one too;” she stuck her back, marched quite proud, though inconvenient indeed. And, that, tails became fashion among caddis-baits pool, end Long Pond last May, toddled long straws sticking behind, getting other’s legs, tumbling other, looking ridiculous, Tom laughed till he cried, did. But quite right, know; people must always follow fashion, even spoon-bonnets. Then sometimes he came deep still reach; he saw water-forests. They would looked little weeds: Tom, must remember, little everything looked hundred times big you, things minnow, sees catches little water-creatures see microscope. And water-forest he saw water-monkeys water-squirrels (they six legs, though; everything almost six legs water, except efts water-babies); nimbly enough ran among branches. There water-flowers too, thousands; Tom tried pick them: soon he touched them, drew turned knots jelly; Tom saw alive—bells, stars, wheels, flowers, beautiful shapes colours; alive busy, Tom was. So he found great deal world he fancied first sight. There one wonderful little fellow, too, peeped top house built round bricks. He two big wheels, one little one, teeth, spinning round round like wheels thrashing-machine; Tom stood stared him, see he going make his machinery. And think he doing? Brick-making. With his two big wheels he swept together mud floated water: nice he put his stomach ate; mud he put little wheel his breast, really round hole set teeth; he spun neat hard round brick; he took stuck top his house-wall, set work make another. Now he clever little fellow? Tom thought so: he wanted talk brick-maker much busy proud his work take notice him. Now must know things water talk; language ours; horses, dogs, cows, birds talk other; Tom soon learned understand talk them; he might pleasant company he good boy. But I sorry say, he like little boys, fond hunting tormenting creatures mere sport. Some people say boys cannot help it; nature, proof originally descended beasts prey. But whether nature not, little boys help it, must help it. For naughty, low, mischievous tricks nature, monkeys have, reason give way tricks like monkeys, know better. And therefore must torment dumb creatures; do, certain old lady coming surely give exactly deserve. But Tom know that; he pecked howked poor water-things sadly, till afraid him, got his way, crept shells; he one speak play with. The water-fairies, course, sorry see unhappy, longed take him, tell naughty he was, teach good, play romp too: forbidden that. Tom learn his lesson sound sharp experience, many another foolish person do, though may many kind heart yearning while, longing teach teach themselves. At last one day he found caddis, wanted peep house: house-door shut. He never seen caddis house-door before: must he do, meddlesome little fellow, pull open, see poor lady inside. What shame! How like one breaking bedroom-door in, see looked bed? So Tom broke pieces door, prettiest little grating silk, stuck shining bits crystal; he looked in, caddis poked her head, turned shape bird’s. But Tom spoke her she could answer; her mouth face tight tied new night-cap neat pink skin. However, she did not answer, caddises did; held hands shrieked like cats Struwelpeter: “_Oh_, _you nasty horrid boy_; _there again_! _And she laid herself fortnight’s sleep_, _and she would come beautiful wings_, _and flown about_, _and laid lots eggs_: _and broken her door_, _and she cannot mend her mouth tied fortnight_, _and she die_. _Who sent worry us lives_?” So Tom swam away. He much ashamed himself, felt naughtier; little boys done wrong will not say so. Then he came pool full little trout, began tormenting them, trying catch them: slipped his fingers, jumped clean water fright. But Tom chased them, he came close great dark hover alder root, floushed huge old brown trout ten times big he was, ran right him, knocked breath his body; I do not know frightened two. Then he went sulky lonely, he deserved be; bank he saw ugly dirty creature sitting, half big himself; six legs, big stomach, ridiculous head two great eyes face like donkey’s. “Oh,” said Tom, “you ugly fellow sure!” he began making faces him; put his nose close him, halloed him, like rude boy. When, hey presto; thing’s donkey-face came moment, popped long arm pair pincers end it, caught Tom nose. It hurt much; held quite tight. “Yah, ah! Oh, let go!” cried Tom. “Then let go,” said creature. “I want quiet. I want split.” Tom promised let alone, he let go. “Why want split?” said Tom. “Because brothers sisters split, turned beautiful creatures wings; I want split too. Do not speak me. I sure I shall split. I split!” Tom stood still, watched him. And he swelled himself, puffed, stretched stiff, last—crack, puff, bang—he opened his back, top his head. And his inside came slender, elegant, soft creature, soft smooth Tom: pale weak, like little child ill long time dark room. It moved legs feebly; looked half ashamed, like girl she goes first time ballroom; began walking slowly grass stem top water. Tom astonished he never said word he stared his eyes. And he went top water too, peeped see would happen. And creature sat warm bright sun, wonderful change came it. It grew strong firm; lovely colours began show body, blue yellow black, spots bars rings; back rose four great wings bright brown gauze; eyes grew large filled head, shone like ten thousand diamonds. “Oh, beautiful creature!” said Tom; he put his hand catch it. But thing whirred air, hung poised wings moment, settled Tom quite fearless. “No!” said, “you cannot catch me. I dragon-fly now, king flies; I shall dance sunshine, hawk river, catch gnats, beautiful wife like myself. I know I shall do. Hurrah!” And he flew away air, began catching gnats. “Oh! come back, come back,” cried Tom, “you beautiful creature. I one play with, I lonely here. If come back I never try catch you.” “I do not care whether not,” said dragon-fly; “for cannot. But I dinner, looked little pretty place, I come back, little chat I seen travels. Why, huge tree is! huge leaves it!” It big dock: know dragon-fly never seen little water-trees; starwort, milfoil, water-crowfoot, like; look big him. Besides, he short-sighted, dragon-flies are; never could see yard his nose; great many folks, half handsome he. The dragon-fly come back, chatted away Tom. He little conceited his fine colours his large wings; know, he poor dirty ugly creature his life before; great excuses him. He fond talking wonderful things he saw trees meadows; Tom liked listen him, he forgotten them. So little became great friends. And I glad say, Tom learned lesson day, he torment creatures long time after. And caddises grew quite tame, used tell strange stories way built houses, changed skins, turned last winged flies; till Tom began long change his skin, wings like day. And trout he made (for trout soon forget frightened hurt). So Tom used play hare hounds, great fun had; he used try leap water, head heels, shower came on; somehow he never could manage it. He liked most, though, see rising flies, sailed round round shadow great oak, beetles fell flop water, green caterpillars let boughs silk ropes reason all; changed foolish minds reason either; hauled tree, rolling rope ball paws; clever rope-dancer’s trick, neither Blondin Leotard could it: take much trouble one tell; cannot get living, Blondin Leotard do, trying break necks string. And often Tom caught touched water; caught alder-flies, caperers, cock-tailed duns spinners, yellow, brown, claret, gray, gave his friends trout. Perhaps he quite kind flies; one must good turn one’s friends one can. And last he gave catching even flies; he made acquaintance one accident found merry little fellow. And way happened; quite true. He basking top water one hot day July, catching duns feeding trout, he saw new sort, dark gray little fellow brown head. He little fellow indeed: he made himself, people ought do. He cocked his head, he cocked his wings, he cocked his tail, he cocked two whisks his tail-end, and, short, he looked cockiest little man little men. And he proved be; instead getting away, he hopped upon Tom’s finger, sat bold nine tailors; he cried tiniest, shrillest, squeakiest little voice ever heard, “Much obliged you, indeed; I do not want yet.” “Want what?” said Tom, quite taken aback his impudence. “Your leg, kind enough hold sit on. I must go see wife minutes. Dear me! troublesome business family is!” (though idle little rogue nothing all, left his poor wife lay eggs herself). “When I come back, I shall glad it, you will good keep sticking so;” he flew. Tom thought cool sort personage; still so, when, five minutes he came back, said—“Ah, tired waiting? Well, leg well.” And he popped Tom’s knee, began chatting away his squeaking voice. “So live water? It is low place. I lived time; shabby dirty. But I did not choose last. So I turned respectable, came top, put gray suit. It is business-like suit, think, do not you?” “Very neat quiet indeed,” said Tom. “Yes, one must quiet neat respectable, sort thing little, one becomes family man. But I am tired it, that is truth. I have done quite enough business, I consider, last week, last life. So I shall put ball dress, go smart man, see gay world, dance two. Why should not one jolly one can?” “And become wife?” “Oh! she plain stupid creature, that is truth; thinks nothing eggs. If she chooses come, she may; not, I go without her;—and I go.” And, he spoke, he turned quite pale, quite white. “Why, you are ill!” said Tom. But he answer. “You are dead,” said Tom, looking he stood his knee white ghost. “No, I are not!” answered little squeaking voice his head. “This here, ball-dress; that is skin. Ha, ha! could trick that!” And Tom could, Houdin, Robin, Frikell, conjurors world. For little rogue jumped clean his skin, left standing Tom’s knee, eyes, wings, legs, tail, exactly alive. “Ha, ha!” he said, he jerked skipped down, never stopping instant, he St. Vitus’s dance. “Are not I pretty fellow now?” And he was; his body white, his tail orange, his eyes colours peacock’s tail. And oddest all, whisks end his tail grown five times long before. “Ah!” said he, “now I see gay world. My living, will not cost much, I mouth, see, inside; I never hungry stomach-ache neither.” No he had. He grown dry hard empty quill, silly shallow-hearted fellows deserve grow. But, instead ashamed his emptiness, he quite proud it, good many fine gentlemen are, began flirting flipping down, singing— “_My wife shall dance_, _and I shall sing_, _So merrily pass day_; _For I hold quite wisest thing_, _To drive dull care away_.” And he danced three days three nights, till he grew tired, he tumbled water, floated down. But became Tom never knew, he never minded; Tom heard singing last, he floated down— “_To drive dull care away-ay-ay_!” And he care, nobody else cared either. But one day Tom new adventure. He sitting water-lily leaf, he his friend dragon-fly, watching gnats dance. The dragon-fly eaten many he wanted, sitting quite still sleepy, hot bright. The gnats (who care least poor brothers’ death) danced foot his head quite happily, large black fly settled within inch his nose, began washing his face combing his hair his paws: dragon-fly never stirred, kept chatting Tom times he lived water. Suddenly, Tom heard strangest noise stream; cooing, grunting, whining, squeaking, put bag two stock-doves, nine mice, three guinea-pigs, blind puppy, left settle make music. He looked water, he saw sight strange noise; great ball rolling stream, seeming one moment soft brown fur, next shining glass: yet ball; sometimes broke streamed away pieces, joined again; noise came louder louder. Tom asked dragon-fly could be: but, course, his short sight, he could even see it, though ten yards away. So he took neatest little header water, started see himself; and, he came near, ball turned four five beautiful creatures, many times larger Tom, swimming about, rolling, diving, twisting, wrestling, cuddling, kissing biting, scratching, charming fashion ever seen. And do not believe me, may go Zoological Gardens (for I afraid will not see nearer, unless, perhaps, get five morning, go Cordery’s Moor, watch great withy pollard hangs backwater, otters breed sometimes), say, otters play water merriest, lithest, gracefullest creatures ever saw. But, biggest saw Tom, she darted rest, cried water-language sharply enough, “Quick, children, something eat, indeed!” came poor Tom, showing wicked pair eyes, set sharp teeth grinning mouth, Tom, thought her handsome, said himself, _Handsome handsome does_, slipped water-lily roots fast he could, turned round made faces her. “Come out,” said wicked old otter, “or worse you.” But Tom looked her two thick roots, shook his might, making horrible faces while, he used grin railings old women, he lived before. It quite well bred, doubt; know, Tom finished his education yet. “Come, away, children,” said otter disgust, “it worth eating, all. It nasty eft, nothing eats, even vulgar pike pond.” “I eft!” said Tom; “efts tails.” “You eft,” said otter, positively; “I see two hands quite plain, I know tail.” “I tell I not,” said Tom. “Look here!” he turned his pretty little self quite round; and, sure enough, he tail you. The otter might got saying Tom frog: but, like great many people, she said thing, she stood it, right wrong; she answered: “I say eft, therefore are, fit food gentlefolk like children. You may stay till salmon eat (she knew salmon would not, she wanted frighten poor Tom). Ha! ha! eat you, eat them;” otter laughed wicked cruel laugh—as may hear sometimes; first time hear probably think bogies. “What salmon?” asked Tom. “Fish, eft, great fish, nice fish eat. They lords fish, lords salmon;” she laughed again. “We hunt pools, drive corner, silly things; proud, bully little trout, minnows, till see us coming, meek once, catch them, disdain eat all; bite soft throats suck sweet juice—Oh, good!”—(and she licked her wicked lips)—“and throw away, go catch another. They coming soon, children, coming soon; I smell rain coming sea, hurrah fresh, salmon, plenty eating day long.” And otter grew proud she turned head heels twice, stood upright half water, grinning like Cheshire cat. “And come from?” asked Tom, kept close, he considerably frightened. “Out sea, eft, great wide sea, might stay safe liked. But sea silly things come, great river below, come watch them; go go follow them. And fish bass pollock, jolly days along shore, toss roll breakers, sleep snug warm dry crags. Ah, merry life too, children, horrid men.” “What men?” asked Tom; somehow he seemed know he asked. “Two-legged things, eft: and, I come look you, actually something like you, tail” (she determined Tom tail), “only great deal bigger, worse luck us; catch fish hooks lines, get feet sometimes, set pots along rocks catch lobsters. They speared poor dear husband he went find something eat. I laid among crags then, low world, sea rough fish would come shore. But speared him, poor fellow, I saw carrying away upon pole. All, he lost his life sakes, children, poor dear obedient creature he was.” And otter grew sentimental (for otters sentimental choose, like good many people cruel greedy, good anybody all) she sailed solemnly away burn, Tom saw her time. And lucky her she so; sooner she gone, bank came seven little rough terrier doors, snuffing yapping, grubbing splashing, full cry otter. Tom hid among water-lilies till gone; he could guess water-fairies come help him. But he could help thinking otter said great river broad sea. And, he thought, he longed go see them. He could tell why; he thought, he grew discontented narrow little stream he lived, his companions there; wanted get wide wide world, enjoy wonderful sights he sure full. And he set go stream. But stream low; he came shallows he could keep water, water left keep under. So sun burned his back made sick; he went back lay quiet pool whole week more. And then, evening hot day, he saw sight. He stupid day, trout; would move inch take fly, though thousands water, lay dozing bottom shade stones; Tom lay dozing too, glad cuddle smooth cool sides, water quite warm unpleasant. But toward evening grew suddenly dark, Tom looked saw blanket black clouds lying right across valley his head, resting crags right left. He felt quite frightened, still; everything still. There whisper wind, chirp bird heard; next great drops rain fell plop water, one hit Tom nose, made pop his head quickly enough. And thunder roared, lightning flashed, leapt across Vendale back again, cloud cloud, cliff cliff, till rocks stream seemed shake: Tom looked water, thought finest thing he ever saw his life. But water he dared put his head; rain came bucketsful, hail hammered like shot stream, churned foam; soon stream rose, rushed down, higher higher, fouler fouler, full beetles, sticks; straws, worms, addle-eggs, wood-lice, leeches, odds ends, omnium-gatherums, this, that, other, enough fill nine museums. Tom could hardly stand stream, hid behind rock. But trout not; rushed among stones, began gobbling beetles leeches greedy quarrelsome way, swimming great worms hanging mouths, tugging kicking get away other. And now, flashes lightning, Tom saw new sight—all bottom stream alive great eels, turning twisting along, stream away. They hiding weeks past cracks rocks, burrows mud; Tom hardly ever seen them, except night: out, went hurrying past fiercely wildly he quite frightened. And hurried past he could hear say other, “We must run, must run. What jolly thunderstorm! Down sea, sea!” And otter came her brood, twining sweeping along fast eels themselves; she spied Tom she came by, said “Now time, eft, want see world. Come along, children, never mind nasty eels: shall breakfast salmon to-morrow. Down sea, sea!” Then came flash brighter rest, light it—in thousandth part second gone again—but he seen them, he certain it—Three beautiful little white girls, arms twined round other’s necks, floating torrent, sang, “Down sea, sea!” “Oh stay! Wait me!” cried Tom; gone: yet he could hear voices clear sweet roar thunder water wind, singing died away, “Down sea!” “Down sea?” said Tom; “everything going sea, I go too. Good-bye, trout.” But trout busy gobbling worms never turned answer him; Tom spared pain bidding farewell. And now, rushing stream, guided bright flashes storm; past tall birch-fringed rocks, shone one moment clear day, next dark night; past dark hovers swirling banks, great trout rushed Tom, thinking good eat, turned back sulkily, fairies sent home tremendous scolding, daring meddle water-baby; narrow strids roaring cataracts, Tom deafened blinded moment rushing waters; along deep reaches, white water-lilies tossed flapped beneath wind hail; past sleeping villages; dark bridge-arches, away away sea. And Tom could stop, care stop; he would see great world below, salmon, breakers, wide wide sea. And daylight came, Tom found salmon river. And sort river it? Was like Irish stream, winding brown bogs, wild ducks squatter among white water-lilies, curlews flit fro, crying “Tullie-wheep, mind sheep;” Dennis tells strange stories Peishtamore, great bogy-snake lies black peat pools, among old pine-stems, puts his head night snap cattle come drink?—But must believe Dennis tells you, mind; ask him: “Is salmon here, think, Dennis?” “Is salmon, thin, honour manes? Salmon? Cartloads thim, thin, an’ ridgmens, shouldthering ache water, av’ ye’d luck see thim.” Then fish pool over, never get rise. “But cannot salmon here, Dennis! and, you will think, one come last tide, he would gone higher pools now.” “Shure thin, honour’s thrue fisherman, understands like book. Why, ye spake ye’d known wather thousand years! As I said, could fish all, now?” “But said shouldering water?” And Dennis look his handsome, sly, soft, sleepy, good-natured, untrustable, Irish gray eye, answer prettiest smile: “Shure, did not I think honour would like pleasant answer?” So must trust Dennis, he habit giving pleasant answers: but, instead angry him, must remember he poor Paddy, knows better; must burst laughing; he burst laughing too, slave you, trot you, show good sport he can—for he affectionate fellow, fond sport are—and he cannot, tell fibs instead, hundred hour; wonder poor ould Ireland prosper like England Scotland, places, folk taken ridiculous fancy honesty best policy. Or like Welsh salmon river, remarkable chiefly (at least, till last year) containing salmon, poached enlightened peasantry, prevent _Cythrawl Sassenach_ (which means you, little dear, kith kin, signifies much Chinese _Fan Quei_) coming bothering Wales, good tackle, ready money, civilisation, common honesty, like things Cymry stand need whatsoever? Or salmon stream I trust see among Hampshire water-meadows hairs gray, wise new fishing-laws?—when Winchester apprentices shall covenant, three hundred years ago, made eat salmon three days week; fresh-run fish shall plentiful Salisbury spire Holly-hole Christchurch; good time coming, folks shall see that, Heaven’s gifts food, one protected carefully worthy gentleman salmon, generous enough go sea weighing five ounces, come back next year weighing five pounds, without cost soil state one farthing? Or like Scotch stream, Arthur Clough drew his “Bothie”:— “_Where ledge granite_ _Into granite bason amber torrent descended_. . . . . _Beautiful colour derived green rocks under_; _Beautiful all_, _where beads foam uprising_ _Mingle clouds white delicate hue stillness_. . . . _Cliff cliff sides_, _with rowan pendant birch boughs_.” . . . Ah, little man, big man, fish stream that, hardly care, I think, whether she roaring full spate, like coffee covered scald cream, fish swirling fly oar-blade swirls boat-race, flashing cataract like silver arrows, fiercest foam; whether fall dwindled single thread, shingle white dusty turnpike road, salmon huddle together one dark cloud clear amber pool, sleeping away time till rain creeps back sea. You care much, eyes brains; lay rod contentedly, drink eyes beauty glorious place; listen water-ouzel piping stones, watch yellow roes come drink look great soft trustful eyes, much say, “You could heart shoot us?” And then, sense, turn talk great giant gilly lies basking stone beside you. He tell fibs, little man; he Scotchman, fears God, priest; and, talk him, surprised his knowledge, his sense, his humour, his courtesy; find out—unless found before—that man may learn his Bible thorough gentleman he brought drawing-rooms London. No. It none these, salmon stream Harthover. It stream see dear old Bewick; Bewick, born bred upon them. A full hundred yards broad was, sliding broad pool broad shallow, broad shallow broad pool, great fields shingle, oak ash coverts, past low cliffs sandstone, past green meadows, fair parks, great house gray stone, brown moors above, sky smoking chimney colliery. You must look Bewick see like, he drawn hundred times care love true north countryman; and, even care salmon river, ought, like good boys, know Bewick. At least, old Sir John used say, sensibly he put too, he will not do: “If want describe finished young gentleman France, I hear, say him, ‘_Il sait son Rabelais_.’ But I want describe one England, I say, ‘_He knows his Bewick_.’ And I think higher compliment.” But Tom thought nothing river like. All his fancy was, get wide wide sea. And he came place river spread broad still shallow reaches, wide little Tom, he put his head water, could hardly see across. And he stopped. He got little frightened. “This must sea,” he thought. “What wide place is! If I go I shall surely lose way, strange thing bite me. I stop look otter, eels, one tell I shall go.” So he went back little way, crept crack rock, river opened wide shallows, watched one tell his way: otter eels gone miles miles stream. There he waited, slept too, he quite tired his night’s journey; and, he woke, stream clearing beautiful amber hue, though still high. And he saw sight made jump up; he knew moment one things he come look for. Such fish! ten times big biggest trout, hundred times big Tom, sculling stream past him, easily Tom sculled down. Such fish! shining silver head tail, crimson dot; grand hooked nose grand curling lip, grand bright eye, looking round proudly king, surveying water right left belonged him. Surely he must salmon, king fish. Tom frightened he longed creep hole; he need been; salmon true gentlemen, and, like true gentlemen, look noble proud enough, yet, like true gentlemen, never harm quarrel one, go business, leave rude fellows themselves. The salmon looked full face, went without minding him, swish two his tail made stream boil again. And minutes came another, four five, on; passed Tom, rushing plunging cataract strong strokes silver tails, leaping clean water rock, shining gloriously moment bright sun; Tom delighted he could watched day long. And last one came bigger rest; he came slowly, stopped, looked back, seemed anxious busy. And Tom saw he helping another salmon, especially handsome one, single spot upon it, clothed pure silver nose tail. “My dear,” said great fish his companion, “you really look dreadfully tired, must over-exert first. Do rest behind rock;” he shoved her gently his nose, rock Tom sat. You must know salmon’s wife. For salmon, like true gentlemen, always choose lady, love her, true her, take care her work her, fight her, every true gentleman ought; like vulgar chub roach pike, high feelings, take care wives. Then he saw Tom, looked fiercely one moment, he going bite him. “What want here?” he said, fiercely. “Oh, do not hurt me!” cried Tom. “I want look you; handsome.” “Ah?” said salmon, stately civilly. “I really beg pardon; I see are, little dear. I met one two creatures like before, found agreeable well-behaved. Indeed, one showed great kindness lately, I hope able repay. I hope shall way here. As soon lady rested, shall proceed journey.” What well-bred old salmon he was! “So seen things like before?” asked Tom. “Several times, dear. Indeed, last night one river’s mouth came warned wife new stake-nets got stream, I cannot tell how, since last winter, showed us way round them, charmingly obliging way.” “So babies sea?” cried Tom, clapped his little hands. “Then I shall one play there? How delightful!” “Were babies stream?” asked lady salmon. “No! I grew lonely. I thought I saw three last night; gone instant, sea. So I went too; I nothing play caddises dragon-flies trout.” “Ugh!” cried lady, “what low company!” “My dear, he low company, he certainly learnt low manners,” said salmon. “No, indeed, poor little dear: sad live among people caddises, actually six legs, nasty things; dragon-flies, too! even good eat; I tried once, hard empty; and, trout, every one knows are.” Whereon she curled her lip, looked dreadfully scornful, her husband curled his too, till he looked proud Alcibiades. “Why dislike trout so?” asked Tom. “My dear, even mention them, help it; I sorry say relations us credit. A great many years ago like us: lazy, cowardly, greedy, instead going sea every year see world grow strong fat, chose stay poke little streams eat worms grubs; properly punished it; grown ugly brown spotted small; actually degraded tastes, eat children.” “And pretend scrape acquaintance us again,” said lady. “Why, I actually known one propose lady salmon, little impudent little creature.” “I hope,” said gentleman, “that ladies race would degrade listening creature instant. If I saw thing happen, I consider duty put death upon spot.” So old salmon said, like old blue-blooded hidalgo Spain; more, he would done too. For must know, enemies bitter race; salmon looks trout, great folks look little folks, something much like tolerated. CHAPTER IV “Sweet lore Nature brings; Our meddling intellect Mis-shapes beauteous forms things We murder dissect. Enough science art: Close barren leaves; Come forth, bring heart That watches receives.” WORDSWORTH. SO salmon went up, Tom warned wicked old otter; Tom went down, slowly cautiously, coasting along shore. He many days it, many miles sea; perhaps he would never found his way, fairies guided him, without his seeing fair faces, feeling gentle hands. And, he went, he strange adventure. It clear still September night, moon shone brightly water, he could sleep, though he shut his eyes tight possible. So last he came top, sat upon little point rock, looked broad yellow moon, wondered she was, thought she looked him. And he watched moonlight rippling river, black heads firs, silver-frosted lawns, listened owl’s hoot, snipe’s bleat, fox’s bark, otter’s laugh; smelt soft perfume birches, wafts heather honey grouse moor far above; felt happy, though he could well tell why. You, course, would cold sitting September night, without least bit clothes wet back; Tom water-baby, therefore felt cold fish. Suddenly, he saw beautiful sight. A bright red light moved along river-side, threw water long tap-root flame. Tom, curious little rogue he was, must needs go see was; he swam shore, met light stopped shallow run edge low rock. And there, underneath light, lay five six great salmon, looking flame great goggle eyes, wagging tails, much pleased it. Tom came top, look wonderful light nearer, made splash. And he heard voice say: “There fish rose.” He know words meant: he seemed know sound them, know voice spoke them; he saw bank three great two-legged creatures, one held light, flaring sputtering, another long pole. And he knew men, frightened, crept hole rock, he could see went on. The man torch bent water, looked earnestly in; he said: “Tak’ muckle fellow, lad; he is ower fifteen punds; haud hand steady.” Tom felt danger coming, longed warn foolish salmon, kept staring light he bewitched. But he could make his mind, came pole water; fearful splash struggle, Tom saw poor salmon speared right through, lifted water. And then, behind, sprang three men three men; shouts, blows, words Tom recollected heard before; he shuddered turned sick now, he felt somehow strange, ugly, wrong, horrible. And began come back him. They men; fighting; savage, desperate, up-and-down fighting, Tom seen many times before. And he stopped his little ears, longed swim away; glad he water-baby, nothing horrid dirty men, foul clothes backs, foul words lips; he dared stir his hole: rock shook his head trampling struggling keepers poachers. All sudden tremendous splash, frightful flash, hissing, still. For water, close Tom, fell one men; he held light his hand. Into swift river he sank, rolled current. Tom heard men run along seemingly looking him; he drifted deep hole below, lay quite still, could find him. Tom waited long time, till quiet; he peeped out, saw man lying. At last he screwed his courage swam him. “Perhaps,” he thought, “the water made fall asleep, me.” Then he went nearer. He grew curious, he could tell why. He must go look him. He would go quietly, course; he swam round round him, closer closer; and, he stir, last he came quite close looked face. The moon shone bright Tom could see every feature; and, he saw, he recollected, bit bit, his old master, Grimes. Tom turned tail, swam away fast he could. “Oh dear me!” he thought, “now he turn water-baby. What nasty troublesome one he be! And perhaps he find out, beat again.” So he went river little way, lay rest night alder root; but, morning came, he longed go big pool, see whether Mr. Grimes turned water-baby yet. So he went carefully, peeping round rocks, hiding roots. Mr. Grimes lay still; he turned water-baby. In afternoon Tom went back again. He could rest till he found become Mr. Grimes. But time Mr. Grimes gone; Tom made his mind he turned water-baby. He might made easy, poor little man; Mr. Grimes turn water-baby, anything like one all. But he make easy; long time he fearful lest he meet Grimes suddenly deep pool. He could know fairies carried away, put him, put everything falls water, exactly ought be. But, know, happened Mr. Grimes effect he never poached salmon more. And quite certain that, man becomes confirmed poacher, way cure put water twenty-four hours, like Grimes. So grow big man, behave honest fellows should; never touch fish head game belongs another man without his express leave; people call gentleman, treat like one; perhaps give good sport: instead hitting river, calling poaching snob. Then Tom went down, he afraid staying near Grimes: he went, vale looked sad. The red yellow leaves showered river; flies beetles dead gone; chill autumn fog lay low upon hills, sometimes spread thickly river he could see his way. But he felt his way instead, following flow stream, day day, past great bridges, past boats barges, past great town, wharfs, mills, tall smoking chimneys, ships rode anchor stream; he ran hawsers, wondered were, peeped out, saw sailors lounging board smoking pipes; ducked again, he terribly afraid caught man turned chimney-sweep more. He know fairies close always, shutting sailors’ eyes lest see him, turning aside millraces, sewer-mouths, foul dangerous things. Poor little fellow, dreary journey him; he longed back Vendale, playing trout bright summer sun. But could be. What never come again. And people little babies, even water-babies, lives. Besides, people make minds go see world, Tom did, must needs find weary journey. Lucky lose heart stop half-way, instead going bravely end Tom did. For remain neither boys men, neither fish, flesh, good red-herring: learnt great deal much, yet enough; sown wild oats, without advantage reaping them. But Tom always brave, determined, little English bull-dog, never knew he beaten; he held, till he saw long way red buoy fog. And he found his surprise, stream turned round, running inland. It tide, course: Tom knew nothing tide. He knew minute water, fresh, turned salt round him. And came change him. He felt strong, light, fresh, his veins run champagne; gave, he know why, three skips water, yard high, head heels, salmon first touch noble rich salt water, which, wise men tell us, mother living things. He care tide him. The red buoy sight, dancing open sea; buoy he would go, he went. He passed great shoals bass mullet, leaping rushing shrimps, he never heeded them, him; he passed great black shining seal, coming mullet. The seal put his head shoulders water, stared him, looking exactly like fat old greasy negro gray pate. And Tom, instead frightened, said, “How d’ye do, sir; beautiful place sea is!” And old seal, instead trying bite him, looked his soft sleepy winking eyes, said, “Good tide you, little man; looking brothers sisters? I passed play outside.” “Oh, then,” said Tom, “I shall playfellows last,” he swam buoy, got upon (for he quite breath) sat there, looked round water-babies: none seen. The sea-breeze came freshly tide blew fog away; little waves danced joy around buoy, old buoy danced them. The shadows clouds ran races bright blue bay, yet never caught up; breakers plunged merrily upon wide white sands, jumped rocks, see green fields inside like, tumbled broke pieces, never minded bit, mended jumped again. And terns hovered Tom like huge white dragon-flies black heads, gulls laughed like girls play, sea-pies, red bills legs, flew fro shore shore, whistled sweet wild. And Tom looked looked, listened; he would happy, he could seen water-babies. Then tide turned, he left buoy, swam round round search them: vain. Sometimes he thought he heard laughing: laughter ripples. And sometimes he thought he saw bottom: white pink shells. And he sure he found one, he saw two bright eyes peeping sand. So he dived down, began scraping sand away, cried, “Do not hide; I want one play much!” And jumped great turbot his ugly eyes mouth awry, flopped away along bottom, knocking poor Tom over. And he sat bottom sea, cried salt tears sheer disappointment. To come way, faced many dangers, yet find water-babies! How hard! Well, seem hard: people, even little babies, cannot want without waiting it, working too, little man, find day. And Tom sat upon buoy long days, long weeks, looking sea, wondering water-babies would come back; yet never came. Then he began ask strange things came sea seen any; said “Yes,” said nothing all. He asked bass pollock; greedy shrimps care answer word. Then came whole fleet purple sea-snails, floating along, sponge full foam, Tom said, “Where come from, pretty creatures? seen water-babies?” And sea-snails answered, “Whence come know not; whither going, tell? We float life mid-ocean, warm sunshine heads, warm gulf-stream below; enough us. Yes; perhaps seen water-babies. We seen many strange things sailed along.” And floated away, happy stupid things, went ashore upon sands. Then came great lazy sunfish, big fat pig cut half; he seemed cut half too, squeezed clothes-press till he flat; his big body big fins he little rabbit’s mouth, bigger Tom’s; and, Tom questioned him, he answered little squeaky feeble voice: “I am sure I do not know; I have lost way. I meant go Chesapeake, I am afraid I have got wrong somehow. Dear me! following pleasant warm water. I am sure I have lost way.” And, Tom asked again, he could answer, “I have lost way. Do not talk me; I want think.” But, like good many people, he tried think less he could think; Tom saw blundering day, till coast-guardsmen saw his big fin water, rowed out, struck boat-hook him, took away. They took town showed penny head, made good day’s work it. But course Tom know that. Then came shoal porpoises, rolling went—papas, mammas, little children—and quite smooth shiny, fairies French-polish every morning; sighed softly came by, Tom took courage speak them: answered was, “Hush, hush, hush;” learnt say. And came shoal basking sharks’ long boat, Tom frightened them. But lazy good-natured fellows, greedy tyrants, like white sharks blue sharks ground sharks hammer-heads, eat men, saw-fish threshers ice-sharks, hunt poor old whales. They came rubbed great sides buoy, lay basking sun backfins water; winked Tom: he never could get speak. They eaten many herrings quite stupid; Tom glad collier brig came frightened away; smell horribly, certainly, he hold his nose tight long there. And came beautiful creature, like ribbon pure silver sharp head long teeth; seemed sick sad. Sometimes rolled helpless side; dashed away glittering like white fire; lay sick motionless. “Where come from?” asked Tom. “And _you_ sick sad?” “I come warm Carolinas, sandbanks fringed pines; great owl-rays leap flap, like giant bats, upon tide. But I wandered north north, upon treacherous warm gulf-stream, till I met cold icebergs, afloat mid ocean. So I got tangled among icebergs, chilled frozen breath. But water-babies helped among them, set free again. And I mending every day; I sick sad; perhaps I shall never get home play owl-rays more.” “Oh!” cried Tom. “And seen water-babies? Have seen near here?” “Yes; helped last night, I eaten great black porpoise.” How vexatious! The water-babies close him, yet he could find one. And he left buoy, used go along sands round rocks, come night—like forsaken Merman Mr. Arnold’s beautiful, beautiful poem, must learn heart day—and sit upon point rock, among shining sea-weeds, low October tides, cry call water-babies; he never heard voice call return. And last, his fretting crying, he grew quite lean thin. But one day among rocks he found playfellow. It water-baby, alas! lobster; distinguished lobster he was; he live barnacles his claws, great mark distinction lobsterdom, bought money good conscience Victoria Cross. Tom never seen lobster before; he mightily taken one; he thought curious, odd, ridiculous creature he ever seen; he far wrong; ingenious men, scientific men, fanciful men, world, old German bogy-painters bargain, could never invent, wits boiled one, anything curious, ridiculous, lobster. He one claw knobbed jagged; Tom delighted watching hold seaweed his knobbed claw, he cut salads his jagged one, put his mouth, smelling them, like monkey. And always little barnacles threw casting-nets swept water, came share whatever dinner. But Tom astonished see he fired off—snap! like leap-frogs make goose’s breast-bone. Certainly he took wonderful shots, backwards, too. For, he wanted go narrow crack ten yards off, think he did? If he gone head foremost, course he could turned round. So he used turn his tail it, lay his long horns, carry his sixth sense tips (and nobody knows sixth sense is), straight his back guide him, twist his eyes back till almost came sockets, made ready, present, fire, snap!—and away he went, pop hole; peeped twiddled his whiskers, much say, “You could not that.” Tom asked water-babies. “Yes,” he said. He seen often. But he think much them. They meddlesome little creatures, went helping fish shells got scrapes. Well, his part, he ashamed helped little soft creatures even she will backs. He lived quite long enough world take care himself. He conceited fellow, old lobster, civil Tom; hear he alter his mind he done, conceited people generally have. But he funny, Tom lonely, he could quarrel him; used sit holes rocks, chat hours. And time happened Tom strange important adventure—so important, indeed, he near never finding water-babies all; I sure would sorry that. I hope forgotten little white lady while. At least, she comes, looking like clean white good little darling, she always was, always be. For befell pleasant short December days, wind always blows south-west, till Old Father Christmas comes spreads great white table-cloth, ready little boys girls give birds Christmas dinner crumbs—it befell (to go on) pleasant December days, Sir John busy hunting nobody home could get word him. Four days week he hunted, good sport he had; two he went bench board guardians, good justice he did; and, he got home time, he dined five; he hated absurd new fashion dining eight hunting season, forces man make interest footman cold beef beer soon he comes in, spoil his appetite, sleep arm-chair his bedroom, stiff tired, two three hours he get his dinner like gentleman. And like Sir John, dear little man, master; and, want either read hard ride hard, stick good old Cambridge hours breakfast eight dinner five; may get two days’ work one. But, course, find fox three afternoon run till dark, leave twenty miles home, must wait dinner till get it, better men done. Only see that, go hungry, horse not; give his warm gruel beer, take gently home, remembering good horses do not grow hedge like blackberries. It befell (to go second time) Sir John, hunting day, dining five, fell asleep every evening, snored terribly windows Harthover shook, soot fell chimneys. Whereon My Lady, able get conversation song dead nightingale, determined go leave him, doctor, Captain Swinger agent, snore concert every evening hearts’ content. So she started seaside children, order put herself condition mild applications iodine. She might well stayed home used Parry’s liquid horse-blister, plenty stables; she would saved her money, saved chance, also, making children ill instead well (as hundreds made), taking nasty smelling undrained lodging, wondering caught scarlatina diphtheria: people will not wise enough understand till dead bad smells, late; besides see, Sir John certainly snore loud. But she went nobody must know, fear young ladies begin fancy water-babies there! hunt howk (besides raising price lodgings), keep aquariums, ladies Pompeii (as may see paintings) used keep Cupids cages. But nobody ever heard starved Cupids, let die dirt neglect, English young ladies poor sea-beasts. So nobody must know My Lady went. Letting water-babies die bad taking singing birds’ eggs; for, though thousands, ay, millions, world, yet one many. Now befell that, shore, rocks, Tom sitting his friend lobster, walked one day little white lady, Ellie herself, her wise man indeed—Professor Ptthmllnsprts. His mother Dutchwoman, therefore he born Curaçao (of course learnt geography, therefore know why); his father Pole, therefore he brought Petropaulowski (of course learnt modern politics, therefore know why): he thorough Englishman ever coveted his neighbour’s goods. And his name, I said, Professor Ptthmllnsprts, ancient noble Polish name. He was, I said, great naturalist, chief professor _Necrobioneopalæonthydrochthonanthropopithekology_ new university king Cannibal Islands founded; and, member Acclimatisation Society, he come collect nasty things he could find coast England, turn loose round Cannibal Islands, nasty things enough eat left. But he worthy kind good-natured little old gentleman; fond children (for he least cannibal himself); good world long good him. Only one fault he had, cock-robins likewise, may see look nursery window—that, one else found curious worm, he would hop round them, peck them, set his tail, bristle his feathers, cock-robin would; declare he found worm first; his worm; and, not, worm all. He met Sir John Scarborough, Fleetwood, somewhere (if do not care where, nobody else does), made acquaintance him, become fond his children. Now, Sir John knew nothing sea-cockyolybirds, cared less, provided fishmonger sent good fish dinner; My Lady knew little: she thought proper children know something. For stupid old times, must understand, children taught know one thing, know well; enlightened new times taught know little everything, know ill; great deal pleasanter easier, therefore quite right. So Ellie he walking rocks, he showing her one ten thousand beautiful curious things seen there. But little Ellie satisfied all. She liked much better play live children, even dolls, she could pretend alive; last she said honestly, “I do not care things, cannot play me, talk me. If little children water, used be, I could see them, I like that.” “Children water, strange little duck?” said professor. “Yes,” said Ellie. “I know used children water, mermaids too, mermen. I saw picture home, beautiful lady sailing car drawn dolphins, babies flying round her, one sitting her lap; mermaids swimming playing, mermen trumpeting conch-shells; called ‘The Triumph Galatea;’ burning mountain picture behind. It hangs great staircase, I looked ever since I baby, dreamt hundred times; beautiful, must true.” But professor least notion allowing things true, merely people thought beautiful. For rate, he said, Baltas would quite right thinking fine thing eat grandpapas, thought ugly thing put underground. The professor, indeed, went further, held man forced believe anything true, he could see, hear, taste, handle. He held strange theories good many things. He even got British Association, declared apes hippopotamus majors brains men have. Which shocking thing say; for, so, would become faith, hope, charity immortal millions? You may think important differences ape, able speak, make machines, know right wrong, say prayers, little matters kind; child’s fancy, dear. Nothing depended great hippopotamus test. If hippopotamus major brain, ape, though four hands, feet, apish apes aperies. But hippopotamus major ever discovered one single ape’s brain, nothing save great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great- greater-greatest-grandmother ape too. No, dear little man; always remember one true, certain, final, all-important difference ape is, hippopotamus major brain, none; that, therefore, discover one brain wrong dangerous thing, every one much shocked, may suppose professor.—Though really, all, do not much matter; because—as Lord Dundreary others would put it—nobody men hippopotamuses brains; so, hippopotamus discovered ape’s brain, would one, know, something else. But professor gone, I sorry say, even that; he read British Association Melbourne, Australia, year 1999, paper assured every one found better wiser news, not, never been, could be, rational half-rational beings except men, anywhere, anywhen, anyhow; _nymphs_, _satyrs_, _fauns_, _inui_, _dwarfs_, _trolls_, _elves_, _gnomes_, _fairies_, _brownies_, _nixes_, _wills_, _kobolds_, _leprechaunes_, _cluricaunes_, _banshees_, _will-of-the-wisps_, _follets_, _lutins_, _magots_, _goblins_, _afrits_, _marids_, _jinns_, _ghouls_, _peris_, _deevs_, _angels_, _archangels_, _imps_, _bogies_, worse, nothing all, pure bosh wind. And he get early morning prove that, eat his breakfast overnight; he it, least his satisfaction. Whereon certain great divine, clever divine he, called regular Sadducee; probably he quite right. Whereon professor, return, called regular Pharisee; probably he quite right too. But quarrel least; for, men men world, hard words run like water duck’s back. So professor divine met dinner evening, sat together sofa afterwards hour, talked state female labour antarctic continent (for nobody talks shop his claret), vowed best company he ever met his life. What advantage men world! From may guess professor least little Ellie’s opinion. So he gave her succinct compendium his famous paper British Association, form suited youthful mind. But, gone his arguments water-babies already, often, repeat here. Now little Ellie was, I suppose, stupid little girl; for, instead convinced Professor Ptthmllnsprts’ arguments, she asked question again. “But water-babies?” I trust hope professor trod moment edge sharp mussel, hurt one his corns sadly, he answered quite sharply, forgetting he scientific man, therefore ought known he could not know; he logician, therefore ought known he could prove universal negative—I say, I trust hope mussel hurt his corn, professor answered quite sharply: “Because are not.” Which even good English, dear little boy; for, must know Aunt Agitate’s Arguments, professor ought said, he angry say anything kind—Because not: none: none them; (if he reading Aunt Agitate too) exist. And he groped his net weeds violently, that, befell, he caught poor little Tom. He felt net heavy; lifted quickly, Tom entangled meshes. “Dear me!” he cried. “What large pink Holothurian; hands, too! It must connected Synapta.” And he took out. “It actually eyes!” he cried. “Why, must Cephalopod! This extraordinary!” “No, I are not!” cried Tom, loud he could; he like called bad names. “It water-baby!” cried Ellie; course was. “Water-fiddlesticks, dear!” said professor; he turned away sharply. There denying it. It water-baby: he said moment ago none. What he do? He would liked, course, taken Tom home bucket. He would put spirits. Of course not. He would kept alive, petted (for he kind old gentleman), written book him, given two long names, first would said little Tom, second himself; course he would called Hydrotecnon Ptthmllnsprtsianum, long name like that; forced call everything long names now, used short ones, ever since took making nine species one. But—what would learned men say his speech British Association? And would Ellie say, he told her? There wise old heathen once, said, “Maxima debetur pueris reverentia”—The greatest reverence due children; is, grown people never say anything wrong children, lest set bad example.—Cousin Cramchild says means, “The greatest respectfulness expected little boys.” But he raised country little boys expected respectful, good President:—Well, every one knows his concerns best; perhaps are. But poor Cousin Cramchild, justice, opinion, moral mission, scholar speak of, hard authority—why, great temptation him. But people, I afraid professor one them, interpret strange, curious, one-sided, left-handed, topsy-turvy, inside-out, behind-before fashion even Cousin Cramchild; make mean, must show respect children, never confessing wrong them, even know so, lest lose confidence elders. Now, professor said Ellie, “Yes, darling, water-baby, wonderful thing is; shows little I know wonders nature, spite forty years’ honest labour. I telling could creatures; and, behold! one come confound conceit show Nature do, done, beyond man’s poor fancy imagine. So, let us thank Maker, Inspirer, Lord Nature His wonderful glorious works, try find something one;”—I think that, professor said that, little Ellie would believed firmly, respected deeply, loved better, ever she done before. But he different opinion. He hesitated moment. He longed keep Tom, yet he half wished he never caught him; last he quite longed get rid him. So he turned away poked Tom his finger, want anything better do; said carelessly, “My dear little maid, must dreamt water-babies last night, head full them.” Now Tom horrible unspeakable fright while; kept quiet he could, though he called Holothurian Cephalopod; fixed his little head man clothes caught him, he might put clothes too, make dirty black chimney-sweep again. But, professor poked him, he could bear; and, fright rage, he turned bay valiantly mouse corner, bit professor’s finger till bled. “Oh! ah! yah!” cried he; glad excuse rid Tom, dropped seaweed, thence he dived water gone moment. “But water-baby, I heard speak!” cried Ellie. “Ah, gone!” And she jumped rock, try catch Tom he slipped sea. Too late! worse, she sprang down, she slipped, fell six feet, her head sharp rock, lay quite still. The professor picked her up, tried waken her, called her, cried her, he loved her much: she would waken all. So he took her his arms carried her her governess, went home; little Ellie put bed, lay quite still; she woke called water-baby: one knew she meant, professor tell, he ashamed tell. And, week, one moonlight night, fairies came flying window brought her pretty pair wings she could help putting on; she flew window, land, sea, clouds, nobody heard saw anything her long while. And say one ever yet seen water-baby. For part, I believe naturalists get dozens dredging; say nothing them, throw overboard again, fear spoiling theories. But, see professor found out, every one due time. A terrible old fairy found professor out; she felt his bumps, cast his nativity, took lunars carefully inside out; she knew he would well she seen print book, say dear old west country; he it; he found beforehand, everybody always is; old fairy find naturalists day, put _Times_, whose side laugh be? So old fairy took hand severely then. But she says she always severe best people, chance curing them, therefore patients pay her best; she work salary Emperor China’s physicians (it pity not), cure, pay. So she took poor professor hand: he content things are, she filled his head things not, try he would like better; he choose believe water-baby he saw it, she made believe worse things water-babies—in _unicorns_, _fire-drakes_, _manticoras_, _basilisks_, _amphisbænas_, _griffins_, _phoenixes_, _rocs_, _orcs_, _dog-headed men_, _three-headed dogs_, _three-bodied geryons_, pleasant creatures, folks think never existed yet, folks hope never exist, though know nothing matter, never will; creatures upset, terrified, flustered, aggravated, confused, astounded, horrified, totally flabbergasted poor professor doctors said he his wits three months; perhaps right, then. So doctors county called make report his case; course every one flatly contradicted other: else use men science? But last majority agreed report true medical language, one half bad Latin, half worse Greek, rest might English, learnt write it. And beginning thereof— “_The subanhypaposupernal anastomoses peritomic diacellurite encephalo digital region distinguished individual whose symptomatic phœnomena melancholy honour_ (_subsequently preliminary diagnostic inspection_) _of making inspectorial diagnosis_, _presenting interexclusively quadrilateral antinomian diathesis known Bumpsterhausen’s blue follicles_, _we proceeded_”— But proceeded My Lady never knew; she frightened long words she ran her life, locked herself her bedroom, fear squashed words strangled sentence. A boa constrictor, she said, bad company enough: boa constrictor made paving stones? “It quite shocking! What think matter him?” said she old nurse. “That his wit’s addled; may wi’ unbelief heathenry,” quoth she. “Then cannot say so?” And heaven, sea, rocks, vales re-echoed—“Why indeed?” But doctors never heard them. So she made Sir John write _Times_ command Chancellor Exchequer time put tax long words;— A light tax words three syllables, necessary evils, like rats: but, like them, must kept judiciously. A heavy tax words four syllables, _heterodoxy_, _spontaneity_, _spiritualism_, _spuriosity_, _etc._ And words five syllables (of I hope one wish see examples), totally prohibitory tax. And similar prohibitory tax words derived three languages once; words derived two languages become common hope rooting rooting peth-winds. The Chancellor Exchequer, scholar man sense, jumped notion; he saw one plan abolishing Schedule D: he brought his bill, Irish members, (I sorry say) Scotch likewise, opposed strongly, ground free country man bound either understand let others understand him. So bill fell first reading; Chancellor, philosopher, comforted thought first time woman hit grand idea men turned stupid noses thereat. Now doctors way; work went earnest, gave poor professor divers sundry medicines, prescribed ancients moderns, Hippocrates Feuchtersleben, below, viz.— 1. _Hellebore_, _to wit_— _Hellebore Æta_. _Hellebore Galatia_. _Hellebore Sicily_. _And Hellebores_, _after method Helleborising Helleborists Helleboric era_. _But would do_. _Bumpsterhausen’s blue follicles would stir inch his encephalo digital region_. 2. _Trying find matter him_, _after method Hippocrates_, _Aretæus_, _Celsus_, _Coelius Aurelianus_, _And Galen_. But found great deal much trouble, people since; recourse to— 3. _Borage_. _Cauteries_. Boring hole his head let fumes, (says Gordonius) “will, without doubt, much good.” But did not. _Bezoar stone_. _Diamargaritum_. _A ram’s brain boiled spice_. _Oil wormwood_. _Water Nile_. _Capers_. _Good wine_ (_but none got_). _The water smith’s forge_. _Ambergris_. _Mandrake pillows_. _Dormouse fat_. _Hares’ ears_. _Starvation_. _Camphor_. _Salts senna_. _Musk_. _Opium_. _Strait-waistcoats_. _Bullyings_. _Bumpings_. _Bleedings_. _Bucketings cold water_. _Knockings down_. _Kneeling his chest till broke in_, _etc. etc._; _after mediæval monkish method_: _but would do_. _Bumpsterhausen’s blue follicles stuck still_. Then— 4. _Coaxing_. _Kissing_. _Champagne turtle_. _Red herrings soda water_. _Good advice_. _Gardening_. _Croquet_. _Musical soirées_. _Aunt Salty_. _Mild tobacco_. _The Saturday Review_. _A carriage outriders_, _etc. etc._ After modern method. But would do. And he convict lunatic, shot Queen, killed his creditors avoid paying them, indulged little amiable eccentricity kind, would given addition— The healthiest situation England, Easthampstead Plain. Free run Windsor Forest. The _Times_ every morning. A double-barrelled gun pointers, leave shoot three Wellington College boys week (not more) case black game scarce. But he neither mad enough bad enough allowed luxuries, grew desperate, fell bad ways, viz.— 5. _Suffumigations sulphur_. _Herrwiggius his_ “_Incomparable drink madmen_:” Only could find was. _Suffumigation liver fish_ * * * Only forgotten name, Dr. Gray could well procure specimen. _Metallic tractors_. _Holloway’s Ointment_. _Electro-biology_. _Valentine Greatrakes his Stroking Cure_. _Spirit-rapping_. _Holloway’s Pills_. _Table-turning_. _Morison’s Pills_. _Homœopathy_. _Parr’s Life Pills_. _Mesmerism_. _Pure Bosh_. _Exorcisms_, _for read Maleus Maleficarum_, _Nideri Formicarium_, _Delrio_, _Wierus_, _etc._ But could get one mentioned water-babies. _Hydropathy_. _Madame Rachel’s Elixir Youth_. _The Poughkeepsie Seer his Prophecies_. _The distilled liquor addle eggs_. _Pyropathy_. As successfully employed old inquisitors cure malady thought, Persian Mollahs cure rheumatism. _Geopathy_, _or burying him_. _Atmopathy_, _or steaming him_. _Sympathy_, _after method Basil Valentine his Triumph Antimony_, _and Kenelm Digby his Weapon-salve_, _which call hair dog bit him_. _Hermopathy_, _or pouring mercury his throat move animal spirits_. _Meteoropathy_, _or going moon look his lost wits_, _as Ruggiero Orlando Furioso’s_: _only_, _having hippogriff_, _they forced use balloon_; _and_, _falling North Sea_, _were picked Yarmouth herring-boat_, _and came home much wiser_, _and scales_. _Antipathy_, _or using like_ “_a man brother_.” _Apathy_, _or nothing all_. _With ipathies opathies Noodle invented_, _and Foodle tried_, _since black-fellows chipped flints Abbéville_—_which considerable time ago_, _to judge Great Exhibition_. But nothing would do; he screamed cried day water-baby, come drive away monsters; course try find one, believe them, thinking nothing Bumpsterhausen’s blue follicles; having, usual, set cart horse, taken effect because. So forced last let poor professor ease his mind writing great book, exactly contrary his old opinions; he proved moon made green cheese, mites (which may see sometimes quite plain telescope, keep lens dirty enough, Mr. Weekes kept his voltaic battery) nothing world little babies, hatching swarming millions, ready come world whenever children want new little brother sister. Which must mistake, one reason: that, atmosphere round moon (though one says is, least side, he round back see, found moon shape Bath bun, wet man moon went Midsummer-day Macintoshes Cording’s boots, spearing eels sneezing); that, therefore, I say, atmosphere, evaporation; therefore dew-point never fall 71.5° zero Fahrenheit: and, therefore, cannot cold enough four of the clock morning condense babies’ mesenteric apophthegms left ventricles; and, therefore, never catch hooping-cough; hooping-cough, cannot babies all; and, therefore, babies moon.—Q.E.D. Which may seem roundabout reason; so, perhaps, is: heard worse ones time, better men are. But one thing certain; that, good old doctor got his book written, he felt considerably relieved Bumpsterhausen’s blue follicles, things infinitely worse; wit, pride vain-glory, blindness hardness heart; true causes Bumpsterhausen’s blue follicles, good many ugly things besides. Whereon foul flood-water his brains ran down, cleared fine coffee colour, fish like rise in, till fine clean fresh-run fish begin rise his brains; he caught two three (which exceedingly fine sport, brain rivers), anatomised carefully, never mentioned he found them, except little children; became ever sadder wiser man; good thing become, dear little boy, even though one pay heavy price blessing. CHAPTER V “Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear The Godhead’s benignant grace; Nor know anything fair As smile upon thy face: Flowers laugh thee beds And fragrance thy footing treads; Thou dost preserve stars wrong; And ancient heavens, Thee, fresh strong.” WORDSWORTH, _Ode Duty_. BUT became little Tom? He slipped away rocks water, I said before. But he could help thinking little Ellie. He remember she was; he knew she little girl, though she hundred times big he. That surprising: size nothing kindred. A tiny weed may first cousin great tree; little dog like Vick knows Lioness dog too, though she twenty times larger herself. So Tom knew Ellie little girl, thought her day, longed her play with; he soon think something else. And account happened him, published next morning, Water-proof Gazette, finest watered paper, use great fairy, Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, reads news carefully every morning, especially police cases, hear soon. He going along rocks three-fathom water, watching pollock catch prawns, wrasses nibble barnacles rocks, shells all, he saw round cage green withes; inside it, looking much ashamed himself, sat his friend lobster, twiddling his horns, instead thumbs. “What, naughty, put lock-up?” asked Tom. The lobster felt little indignant notion, he much depressed spirits argue; he said, “I cannot get out.” “Why get in?” “After nasty piece dead fish.” He thought looked smelt nice he outside, did, lobster: he turned round abused he angry himself. “Where get in?” “Through round hole top.” “Then do not get it?” “Because I cannot:” lobster twiddled his horns fiercely ever, he forced confess. “I jumped upwards, downwards, backwards, sideways, least four thousand times; I cannot get out: I always get underneath there, cannot find hole.” Tom looked trap, wit lobster, he saw plainly enough matter; may look lobster-pot. “Stop bit,” said Tom. “Turn tail me, I will pull hindforemost, will not stick spikes.” But lobster stupid clumsy he could not hit hole. Like great many fox-hunters, he sharp long he his country; soon get lose heads; lobster, speak, lost his tail. Tom reached clawed hole him, till he caught hold him; then, expected, clumsy lobster pulled head foremost. “Hullo! pretty business,” said Tom. “Now take great claws, break points spikes, shall get easily.” “Dear me, I never thought that,” said lobster; “and experience life I had!” You see, experience little good unless man, lobster, wit enough make use it. For good many people, like old Polonius, seen world, yet remain little better children all. But got half spikes away saw great dark cloud them: lo, behold, otter. How she grin grin she saw Tom. “Yar!” said she, “you little meddlesome wretch, I now! I serve telling salmon I was!” And she crawled pot get in. Tom horribly frightened, still frightened she found hole top, squeezed herself right it, eyes teeth. But sooner her head inside valiant Mr. Lobster caught her nose held on. And three pot, rolling over, tight packing was. And lobster tore otter, otter tore lobster, squeezed thumped poor Tom till he breath left his body; I do not know would happened he last got otter’s back, safe hole. He right glad he got out: he would desert his friend saved him; first time he saw his tail uppermost he caught hold it, pulled his might. But lobster would let go. “Come along,” said Tom; “do not see she dead?” And she was, quite drowned dead. And end wicked otter. But lobster would let go. “Come along, stupid old stick-in-the-mud,” cried Tom, “or fisherman catch you!” And true, Tom felt one beginning haul pot. But lobster would let go. Tom saw fisherman haul boat-side, thought him. But Mr. Lobster saw fisherman, he gave furious tremendous snap, he snapped his hand, pot, safe sea. But he left his knobbed claw behind him; never came his stupid head let go all, he shook his claw easier method. It something bull, that; must know lobster Irish lobster, hatched Island Magee mouth Belfast Lough. Tom asked lobster he never thought letting go. He said determinedly point honour among lobsters. And is, Mayor Plymouth found his cost—eight nine hundred years ago, course; happened lately would personal mention it. For one day he tired sitting hard chair, grand furred gown, gold chain round his neck, hearing one policeman another come sing, “What shall drunken sailor, early morning?” answering exactly alike: “Put round house till he gets sober, early morning”— That, over, he jumped up, played leap-frog town-clerk till he burst his buttons, his luncheon, burst buttons, said: “It low spring-tide; I shall go afternoon cut capers.” Now he mean cut capers eat boiled mutton. It commandant artillery Valetta used amuse cutting them, stuck upon one bastions notice, “No one allowed cut capers me,” greatly edified midshipmen port, Maltese Nix Mangiare stairs. But mayor meant he would go afternoon’s fun, like schoolboy, catch lobsters iron hook. So Mewstone he went, lobsters he looked. And he came certain crack rocks he excited that, instead putting his hook, he put his hand; Mr. Lobster home, caught finger, held on. “Yah!” said mayor, pulled hard he dared: he pulled, lobster pinched, till he forced quiet. Then he tried get his hook his hand; hole narrow. Then he pulled again; he could stand pain. Then he shouted bawled help: one nearer men-of-war inside breakwater. Then he began turn little pale; tide flowed, still lobster held on. Then he turned quite white; tide his knees, still lobster held on. Then he thought cutting his finger; he wanted two things with—courage knife; he got neither. Then he turned quite yellow; tide his waist, still lobster held on. Then he thought naughty things he ever done; sand he put sugar, sloe-leaves tea, water treacle, salt tobacco (because his brother brewer, man must help his kin). Then he turned quite blue; tide his breast, still lobster held on. Then, I doubt, he repented fully said naughty things he done, promised mend his life, many think life left mend. Whereby, fancy, make cheap bargain. But old fairy birch rod soon undeceives them. And he grew colours once, turned his eyes like duck thunder; water his chin, still lobster held on. And came man-of-war’s boat round Mewstone, saw his head sticking water. One said keg brandy, another cocoa-nut, another buoy loose, another black diver, wanted fire it, would pleasant mayor: yell came great hole middle midshipman charge guessed was, bade pull fast could. So somehow Jack-tars got lobster out, set mayor free, put ashore Barbican. He never went lobster-catching again; hope he put salt tobacco, even sell his brother’s beer. And story Mayor Plymouth, two advantages—first, quite true; second, (as folks say good stories ought have) moral whatsoever: more, indeed, part book, fairy tale, know. And happened Tom wonderful thing; he left lobster five minutes he came upon water-baby. A real live water-baby, sitting white sand, busy little point rock. And saw Tom looked moment, cried, “Why, one us. You new baby! Oh, delightful!” And ran Tom, Tom ran it, hugged kissed ever long, know why. But want introductions water. At last Tom said, “Oh, while? I looking long, I lonely.” “We days days. There hundreds us rocks. How see us, hear us sing romp every evening go home?” Tom looked baby again, he said: “Well, wonderful! I seen things like again, I thought shells, sea-creatures. I never took water-babies like myself.” Now, odd? So odd, indeed, will, doubt, want know happened, Tom could never find water-baby till he got lobster pot. And, read story nine times over, think yourself, find why. It good little boys told everything, never forced use wits. They would learn, then, Dr. Dulcimer’s famous suburban establishment idler members youthful aristocracy, masters learn lessons boys hear them—which saves great deal trouble—for time being. “Now,” said baby, “come help me, I shall finished brothers sisters come, time go home.” “What shall I help at?” “At poor dear little rock; great clumsy boulder came rolling last storm, knocked head off, rubbed flowers. And I must plant seaweeds, coralline, anemones, I make prettiest little rock-garden shore.” So worked away rock, planted it, smoothed sand round, it, capital fun till tide began turn. And Tom heard babies coming, laughing singing shouting romping; noise made like noise ripple. So he knew he hearing seeing water-babies along; he know them, his eyes ears opened. And came, dozens dozens them, bigger Tom smaller, neatest little white bathing dresses; found he new baby, hugged kissed him, put middle danced round sand, one ever happy poor little Tom. “Now then,” cried once, “we must come away home, must come away home, tide leave us dry. We mended broken sea-weed, put rock-pools order, planted shells sand, nobody see ugly storm swept last week.” And reason rock-pools always neat clean; water-babies come inshore every storm sweep out, comb down, put rights again. Only men wasteful dirty, let sewers run sea instead putting stuff upon fields like thrifty reasonable souls; throw herrings’ heads dead dog-fish, refuse, water; way make mess upon clean shore—there water-babies come, sometimes hundreds years (for cannot abide anything smelly foul), leave sea-anemones crabs clear away everything, till good tidy sea covered dirt soft mud clean sand, water-babies plant live cockles whelks razor-shells sea-cucumbers golden-combs, make pretty live garden again, man’s dirt cleared away. And that, I suppose, reason water-babies watering-place I ever seen. And home water-babies? In St. Brandan’s fairy isle. Did never hear blessed St. Brandan, he preached wild Irish wild, wild Kerry coast, he five hermits, till weary longed rest? For wild Irish would listen them, come confession mass, liked better brew potheen, dance pater o’pee, knock head shillelaghs, shoot behind turf-dykes, steal other’s cattle, burn other’s homes; till St. Brandan his friends weary them, would learn peaceable Christians all. So St. Brandan went point Old Dunmore, looked tide-way roaring round Blasquets, end world, away ocean, sighed—“Ah I wings dove!” And far away, setting sun, he saw blue fairy sea, golden fairy islands, he said, “Those islands blest.” Then he his friends got hooker, sailed away away westward, never heard more. But people would hear changed gorillas, gorillas day. And St. Brandan hermits came fairy isle found overgrown cedars full beautiful birds; he sat cedars preached birds air. And liked his sermons well told fishes sea; came, St. Brandan preached them; fishes told water-babies, live caves isle; came hundreds every Sunday, St. Brandan got quite neat little Sunday-school. And he taught water-babies great many hundred years, till his eyes grew dim see, his beard grew long he dared walk fear treading it, he might tumbled down. And last he five hermits fell fast asleep cedar-shades, sleep unto day. But fairies took water-babies, taught lessons themselves. And say St. Brandan awake begin teach babies more: think he sleep on, better worse, till coming Cocqcigrues. But, still clear summer evenings, sun sinks sea, among golden cloud-capes cloud-islands, locks friths azure sky, sailors fancy see, away westward, St. Brandan’s fairy isle. But whether men see not, St. Brandan’s Isle actually stood there; great land ocean, sunk sunk beneath waves. Old Plato called Atlantis, told strange tales wise men lived therein, wars fought old times. And island came strange flowers, linger still land:—the Cornish heath, Cornish moneywort, delicate Venus’s hair, London-pride covers Kerry mountains, little pink butterwort Devon, great blue butterwort Ireland, Connemara heath, bristle-fern Turk waterfall, many strange plant more; fairy tokens left wise men good children St. Brandan’s Isle. Now Tom got there, he found isle stood pillars, roots full caves. There pillars black basalt, like Staffa; pillars green crimson serpentine, like Kynance; pillars ribboned red white yellow sandstone, like Livermead; blue grottoes like Capri, white grottoes like Adelsberg; curtained draped seaweeds, purple crimson, green brown; strewn soft white sand, water-babies sleep every night. But, keep place clean sweet, crabs picked scraps floor ate like many monkeys; rocks covered ten thousand sea-anemones, corals madrepores, scavenged water day long, kept nice pure. But, make nasty work, left black dirty, poor chimney-sweeps dustmen are. No; fairies considerate that, dressed beautiful colours patterns, till look like vast flower-beds gay blossoms. If think I talking nonsense, I say true; old gentleman named Fourier used say ought chimney-sweeps dustmen, honour instead despising them; he clever old gentleman: but, unfortunately world, mad March hare. And, instead watchmen policemen keep nasty things night, thousands thousands water-snakes, wonderful creatures were. They named Nereids, sea-fairies took care them, Eunice Polynoe, Phyllodoce Psamathe, rest pretty darlings swim round Queen Amphitrite, her car cameo she will. They dressed green velvet, black velvet, purple velvet; jointed rings; three hundred brains apiece, must uncommonly shrewd detectives; eyes tails; eyes every joint, kept sharp look-out; wanted baby-snake, grew one end tails, able take care dropped off; brought families cheaply. But nasty thing came by, rushed upon it; hundreds feet sprang whole cutler’s shop _Scythes_, _Javelins_, _Billhooks_, _Lances_, _Pickaxes_, _Halberts_, _Forks_, _Gisarines_, _Penknives_, _Poleaxes_, _Rapiers_, _Fishhooks_, _Sabres_, _Bradawls_, _Yataghans_, _Gimblets_, _Creeses_, _Corkscrews_, _Ghoorka swords_, _Pins_, _Tucks_, _Needles_, _And forth_, stabbed, shot, poked, pricked, scratched, ripped, pinked, crimped naughty beasts terribly, run lives, else chopped small pieces eaten afterwards. And, all, every word, true, faith microscopes, Linnæan Society. And water-babies thousands, Tom, either, could count.—All little children good fairies take to, cruel mothers fathers not; untaught brought heathens, come grief ill-usage ignorance neglect; little children overlaid, given gin young, let drink hot kettles, fall fire; little children alleys courts, tumble-down cottages, die fever, cholera, measles, scarlatina, nasty complaints one business have, one day, folks common sense; little children killed cruel masters wicked soldiers; there, except, course, babes Bethlehem killed wicked King Herod; taken straight heaven long ago, everybody knows, call Holy Innocents. But I wish Tom given his naughty tricks, left tormenting dumb animals he plenty playfellows amuse him. Instead that, I sorry say, he would meddle creatures, water-snakes, would stand nonsense. So he tickled madrepores, make shut up; frightened crabs, make hide sand peep tips eyes; put stones anemones’ mouths, make fancy dinner coming. The children warned him, said, “Take care at. Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid coming.” But Tom never heeded them, quite riotous high spirits good luck, till, one Friday morning early, Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid came indeed. A tremendous lady she was; children saw her stood row, upright indeed, smoothed bathing dresses, put hands behind them, going examined inspector. And she black bonnet, black shawl, crinoline all; pair large green spectacles, great hooked nose, hooked much bridge stood quite her eyebrows; her arm she carried great birch-rod. Indeed, she ugly Tom tempted make faces her: not; he admire look birch-rod her arm. And she looked children one one, seemed much pleased them, though she never asked one question behaving; began giving sorts nice sea-things—sea-cakes, sea-apples, sea-oranges, sea-bullseyes, sea-toffee; best she gave sea-ices, made sea-cows’ cream, never melt water. And, do not quite believe me, think—What cheap plentiful sea-rock? Then sea-toffee well? And every one find sea-lemons (ready quartered too) look low tide; sea-grapes sometimes, hanging bunches; and, go Nice, find fish-market full sea-fruit, call “frutta di mare:” though I suppose call “fruits de mer” now, compliment successful, therefore immaculate, potentate seemingly desirous inheriting blessing pronounced remove neighbours’ land-mark. And, perhaps, reason place called Nice, many nice things sea there: least, not, ought be. Now little Tom watched sweet things given away, till his mouth watered, his eyes grew round owl’s. For he hoped his turn would come last; did. For lady called up, held her fingers something them, popped his mouth; and, lo behold, nasty cold hard pebble. “You cruel woman,” said he, began whimper. “And cruel boy; puts pebbles sea-anemones’ mouths, take in, make fancy caught good dinner! As them, I must you.” “Who told that?” said Tom. “You yourself, minute.” Tom never opened his lips; he much taken aback indeed. “Yes; every one tells exactly done wrong; without knowing themselves. So use trying hide anything me. Now go, good boy, I put pebbles mouth, put none creatures’.” “I know harm it,” said Tom. “Then know now. People continually say me: I tell them, do not know fire burns, reason burn you; do not know dirt breeds fever, reason fevers kill you. The lobster know harm getting lobster-pot; caught same.” “Dear me,” thought Tom, “she knows everything!” And she did, indeed. “And so, know things wrong reason punished them; though much, much, little man” (and lady looked kindly, all), “as know.” “Well, little hard poor lad,” said Tom. “Not all; I best friend ever life. But I tell you; I cannot help punishing people wrong. I like do; I often very, sorry them, poor things: I cannot help it. If I tried it, I same. For I work machinery, like engine; full wheels springs inside; wound carefully, I cannot help going.” “Was long ago since wound up?” asked Tom. For he thought, cunning little fellow, “She run day: may forget wind her up, old Grimes used forget wind his watch he came public-house; I shall safe.” “I wound all, long ago, I forget it.” “Dear me,” said Tom, “you must made long time!” “I never made, child; I shall go ever ever; I old Eternity, yet young Time.” And came lady’s face curious expression—very solemn, sad; yet very, sweet. And she looked away, she gazing sea, sky, something far, far off; she so, came quiet, tender, patient, hopeful smile her face Tom thought moment she look ugly all. And she did; she like great many people pretty feature faces, yet lovely behold, draw little children’s hearts though house plain enough, yet windows beautiful good spirit looking forth. And Tom smiled her face, she looked pleasant moment. And strange fairy smiled too, said: “Yes. You thought ugly now, not?” Tom hung his head, got red ears. “And I ugly. I ugliest fairy world; I shall be, till people behave ought do. And I shall grow handsome sister, loveliest fairy world; her name Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby. So she begins I end, I begin she ends; listen her must listen me, see. Now, run away, except Tom; he may stay see I going do. It good warning begin with, he goes school. “Now, Tom, every Friday I come call ill-used little children serve served children.” And Tom frightened, crept stone; made two crabs lived angry, frightened friend butter-fish flapping hysterics: he would move them. And first she called doctors give little children much physic (they old ones; young ones learnt better, army surgeons, still fancy baby’s inside much like Scotch grenadier’s), she set row; rueful looked; knew coming. And first she pulled teeth out; she bled round: she dosed calomel, jalap, salts senna, brimstone treacle; horrible faces made; she gave great emetic mustard water, basons; began again; way she spent morning. And she called whole troop foolish ladies, pinch children’s waists toes; she laced tight stays, choked sick, noses grew red, hands feet swelled; she crammed poor feet dreadfully tight boots, made dance, clumsily indeed; she asked liked it; said all, she let go: done foolish fashion, fancying children’s good, wasps’ waists pigs’ toes could pretty, wholesome, use anybody. Then she called careless nurserymaids, stuck pins over, wheeled perambulators tight straps across stomachs heads arms hanging side, till quite sick stupid, would sun-strokes: but, water, could water-strokes; which, I assure you, nearly bad, find try sit mill-wheel. And mind—when hear rumbling bottom sea, sailors tell ground-swell: know better. It old lady wheeling maids perambulators. And time she tired, she go luncheon. And luncheon she set work again, called cruel schoolmasters—whole regiments brigades them; she saw them, she frowned terribly, set work earnest, best part day’s work come. More half nasty, dirty, frowzy, grubby, smelly old monks, who, dare hit man size, amused beating little children instead; may see picture old Pope Gregory (good man true though he was, he meddled things he understand), teaching children sing fa-fa-mi-fa cat-of-nine tails his chair: but, never children own, took heads (as folks still) people world knew manage children: first brought England, old Anglo-Saxon times, fashion treating free boys, girls too, worse would treat dog horse: Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid caught long ago; given many taste rods; much good may them. And she boxed ears, thumped head rulers, pandied hands canes, told told stories, bad sort people; indignant, stood upon honour, declared told truth, she declared not, telling lies; last she birched round soundly her great birch-rod set imposition three hundred thousand lines Hebrew learn heart she came back next Friday. And cried howled so, breaths came sea like bubbles soda-water; one reason bubbles sea. There others: one principally concerns little boys. And time she tired she glad stop; and, indeed, she done good day’s work. Tom quite dislike old lady: he could help thinking her little spiteful—and wonder she was, poor old soul; she wait grow handsome till people would done by, she wait long time. Poor old Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid! she great deal hard work her, better born washerwoman, stood tub day: but, see, people cannot always choose profession. But Tom longed ask her one question; all, whenever she looked him, she look cross all; funny smile her face, she chuckled herself way gave Tom courage, last he said: “Pray, madam, may I ask question?” “Certainly, little dear.” “Why do not bring bad masters serve too? The butties knock poor collier-boys; nailers file lads’ noses hammer fingers; master sweeps, like master Grimes? I saw fall water long ago; I surely expected he would here. I am sure he bad enough me.” Then old lady looked stern Tom quite frightened, sorry he bold. But she angry him. She answered, “I look week round; different place this, knew wrong.” She spoke quietly; something her voice made Tom tingle head foot, he got shoal sea-nettles. “But people,” she went on, “did know wrong: stupid impatient; therefore I punish till become patient, learn use common sense like reasonable beings. But chimney-sweeps, collier-boys, nailer lads, sister set good people stop sort thing; much obliged her I am; she could stop cruel masters ill-using poor children, I grow handsome least thousand years sooner. And good boy, would done by, not; then, sister, MADAME DOASYOUWOULDBEDONEBY, comes Sunday, perhaps she take notice you, teach behave. She understands better I do.” And she went. Tom glad hear chance meeting Grimes again, though he little sorry him, considering he used sometimes give leavings beer: he determined good boy Saturday; he was; he never frightened one crab, tickled live corals, put stones sea anemones’ mouths, make fancy got dinner; Sunday morning came, sure enough, MRS. DOASYOUWOULDBEDONEBY came too. Whereat little children began dancing clapping hands, Tom danced his might. And pretty lady, I cannot tell colour her hair was, or, her eyes: could Tom; for, one looks her, think is, she sweetest, kindest, tenderest, funniest, merriest face ever saw, want see. But Tom saw she tall woman, tall her sister: instead gnarly horny, scaly, prickly, like her, she nice, soft, fat, smooth, pussy, cuddly, delicious creature ever nursed baby; she understood babies thoroughly, she plenty her own, whole rows regiments them, day. And her delight was, whenever she spare moment, play babies, she showed herself woman sense; babies best company, pleasantest playfellows, world; least, wise people world think. And therefore children saw her, naturally caught hold her, pulled her till she sat stone, climbed her lap, clung round her neck, caught hold her hands; put thumbs mouths, began cuddling purring like many kittens, ought done. While could get nowhere else sat sand, cuddled her feet—for one, know, wear shoes water, except horrid old bathing-women, afraid water-babies pinching horny toes. And Tom stood staring them; he could understand about. “And you, little darling?” she said. “Oh, new baby!” cried, pulling thumbs mouths; “and he never mother,” put thumbs back again, wish lose time. “Then I his mother, he shall best place; get out, you, moment.” And she took two great armfuls babies—nine hundred one arm, thirteen hundred other—and threw away, right left, water. But minded naughty boys Struwelpeter minded St. Nicholas dipped his inkstand; even take thumbs mouths, came paddling wriggling back her like many tadpoles, till could see nothing her head foot swarm little babies. But she took Tom her arms, laid softest place all, kissed him, patted him, talked him, tenderly low, things he never heard his life; Tom looked her eyes, loved her, loved, till he fell fast asleep pure love. And he woke she telling children story. And story she tell them? One story she told them, begins every Christmas Eve, yet never ends ever ever; and, she went on, children took thumbs mouths listened quite seriously; sadly all; she never told anything sad; Tom listened too, never grew tired listening. And he listened long he fell fast asleep again, and, he woke, lady nursing still. “Do not go away,” said little Tom. “This nice. I never one cuddle before.” “Do not go away,” said children; “you sung us one song.” “Well, I time one. So shall be?” “The doll lost! The doll lost!” cried babies once. So strange fairy sang:— _I sweet little doll_, _dears_, _The prettiest doll world_; _Her cheeks red white_, _dears_, _And her hair charmingly curled_. _But I lost poor little doll_, _dears_, _As I played heath one day_; _And I cried her week_, _dears_, _But I never could find she lay_. _I found poor little doll_, _dears_, _As I played heath one day_: _Folks say she terribly changed_, _dears_, _For her paint washed away_, _And her arm trodden cows_, _dears_, _And her hair least bit curled_: _Yet_, _for old sakes’ sake she still_, _dears_, _The prettiest doll world_. What silly song fairy sing! And silly water-babies quite delighted it! Well, see advantage Aunt Agitate’s Arguments sea-land below. “Now,” said fairy Tom, “will good boy sake, torment sea-beasts till I come back?” “And cuddle again?” said poor little Tom. “Of course I will, little duck. I like take cuddle way, I must not;” away she went. So Tom really tried good boy, tormented sea-beasts long he lived; he quite alive, I assure you, still. Oh, good little boys ought kind pussy mammas cuddle tell stories; afraid ought growing naughty, bringing tears mammas’ pretty eyes! CHAPTER VI “Thou little child, yet glorious night Of heaven-born freedom thy Being’s height, Why earnest pains dost thou provoke The Years bring inevitable yoke— Thus blindly thy blessedness strife? Full soon thy soul shall her earthly freight, And custom lie upon thee weight Heavy frost, deep almost life.” WORDSWORTH. HERE I come saddest part story. I know people laugh it, call much ado nothing. But I know one man would not; he officer pair gray moustaches long arm, said company two heart-rending sights world, moved tears, he would anything prevent remedy, child broken toy child stealing sweets. The company laugh him; his moustaches long gray that: but, he gone, called sentimental forth, one dear little old Quaker lady soul white her cap, not, course, generally partial soldiers; she said quietly, like Quaker: “Friends, borne upon mind truly brave man.” Now may fancy Tom quite good, he everything he could want wish: would much mistaken. Being quite comfortable good thing; make people good. Indeed, sometimes makes naughty, made people America; made people Bible, waxed fat kicked, like horses overfed underworked. And I sorry say happened little Tom. For he grew fond sea-bullseyes sea-lollipops his foolish little head could think nothing else: he always longing more, wondering strange lady would come give some, she would give him, much, whether she would give others. And he thought nothing lollipops day, dreamt nothing else night—and happened then? That he began watch lady see she kept sweet things: began hiding, sneaking, following her about, pretending looking way, going something else, till he found she kept beautiful mother-of-pearl cabinet away deep crack rocks. And he longed go cabinet, yet he afraid; he longed again, less afraid; last, continual thinking it, he longed violently he afraid all. And one night, children asleep, he could sleep thinking lollipops, he crept away among rocks, got cabinet, behold! open. But, he saw nice things inside, instead delighted, he quite frightened, wished he never come there. And he would touch them, he did; he would taste one, he did; he would eat one, he did; he would eat two, three, on; he terrified lest she come catch him, began gobbling fast he taste them, pleasure them; he felt sick, would one more; one again; till he eaten up. And while, close behind him, stood Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid. Some people may say, But she keep her cupboard locked? Well, I know.—It may seem strange thing, she never keep her cupboard locked; every one may go taste themselves, fare accordingly. It odd, is; I quite sure she knows best. Perhaps she wishes people keep fingers fire, burned. She took her spectacles, she like see much; her pity she arched her eyebrows her hair, her eyes grew wide would taken sorrows world, filled great big tears, often do. But she said was: “Ah, poor little dear! like rest.” But she said herself, Tom neither heard saw her. Now, must fancy she sentimental all. If do, think she going let you, me, human wrong, she tender-hearted punish us, find much mistaken, many man every year every day. But strange fairy she saw her lollipops eaten? Did she fly Tom, catch scruff neck, hold him, howk him, hump him, hurry him, hit him, poke him, pull him, pinch him, pound him, put corner, shake him, slap him, set cold stone reconsider himself, forth? Not bit. You may watch her work know find her. But never see her that. For, she had, she knew quite well Tom would fought, kicked, bit, said bad words, turned moment naughty little heathen chimney-sweep, his hand, like Ishmael’s old, every man, every man’s hand him. Did she question him, hurry him, frighten him, threaten him, make confess? Not bit. You may see her, I said, her work often enough know look her: never see her that. For, she had, she would tempted tell lies his fright; would worse him, possible, even becoming heathen chimney-sweep again. No. She leaves anxious parents teachers (lazy ones, call them), who, instead giving children fair trial, would expect demand themselves, force fright confess faults—which cruel unfair judge bench dare wickedest thief murderer, good British law forbids it—ay, even punish make confess, detestable crime never committed now, save Inquisitors, Kings Naples, wretched people world weary. And say, “We trained child way he go, he grew he departed it. Why Solomon say he would depart it?” But perhaps way beating, hurrying frightening, questioning, way child go; even way colt go want break make quiet serviceable horse. Some folks may say, “Ah! Fairy need she knows everything already.” True. But, she know, she would surely behave worse British judge jury; parents teachers either. So she said nothing matter, even Tom came next day rest sweet things. He horribly afraid coming: he still afraid staying away, lest one suspect him. He dreadfully afraid, too, lest sweets—as expected, he eaten all—and lest fairy inquire taken them. But, behold! she pulled many ever, astonished Tom, frightened still more. And, fairy looked full face, he shook head foot: however she gave his share like rest, he thought within she could found out. But, he put sweets his mouth, he hated taste them; made sick he get away fast he could; terribly sick he was, cross unhappy, week after. Then, next week came, he his share again; fairy looked full face; sadly she ever looked. And he could bear sweets: took spite himself. And Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby came, he wanted cuddled like rest; she said seriously: “I like cuddle you; I cannot, horny prickly.” And Tom looked himself: he prickles, like sea-egg. Which quite natural; must know believe people’s souls make bodies snail makes she will (I joking, little man; I serious, solemn earnest). And therefore, Tom’s soul grew prickly naughty tempers, his body could help growing prickly, too, nobody would cuddle him, play him, even like look him. What could Tom go away hide corner cry? For nobody would play him, he knew full well why. And he miserable week ugly fairy came looked full face, seriously sadly ever, he could stand longer, thrust sweetmeats away, saying, “No, I do not want any: I cannot bear now,” burst crying, poor little man, told Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid every word happened. He horribly frightened he done so; he expected her punish severely. But, instead, she took kissed him, quite pleasant, her chin bristly indeed; he lonely-hearted, he thought rough kissing better none. “I forgive you, little man,” she said. “I always forgive every one moment tell truth accord.” “Then take away nasty prickles?” “That different matter. You put yourself, take away.” “But I that?” asked Tom, crying afresh. “Well, I think time go school; I shall fetch schoolmistress, teach get rid prickles.” And she went away. Tom frightened notion school-mistress; he thought she would certainly come birch-rod cane; he comforted himself, last, she might something like old woman Vendale—which she least; for, fairy brought her, she beautiful little girl ever seen, long curls floating behind her like golden cloud, long robes floating round her like silver one. “There he is,” said fairy; “and must teach good, whether like not.” “I know,” said little girl; she seem quite like, she put her finger her mouth, looked Tom her brows; Tom put his finger his mouth, looked her his brows, he horribly ashamed himself. The little girl seemed hardly know begin; perhaps she would never begun poor Tom burst crying, begged her teach good help cure his prickles; she grew tender-hearted she began teaching prettily ever child taught world. And little girl teach Tom? She taught him, first, taught ever since said first prayers mother’s knees; she taught much simply. For lessons world, child, hard words lessons this, therefore water-babies like better like lessons, long learn more; grown men cannot puzzle quarrel meaning, land; lessons rise clear pure, like Test Overton Pool, everlasting ground life truth. So she taught Tom every day week; Sundays she always went away home, kind fairy took her place. And she taught Tom many Sundays, his prickles vanished quite away, his skin smooth clean again. “Dear me!” said little girl; “why, I know now. You little chimney-sweep came bedroom.” “Dear me!” cried Tom. “And I know you, too, now. You little white lady I saw bed.” And he jumped her, longed hug kiss her; not, remembering she lady born; he jumped round round her till he quite tired. And began telling story—how he got water, she fallen rock; he swum sea, she flown window; this, that, other, till talked out: began again, I cannot say two talked fastest. And set work lessons again, liked well went well till seven full years past gone. You may fancy Tom quite content happy seven years; truth is, he not. He always one thing his mind, was—where little Ellie went, she went home Sundays. To beautiful place, she said. But beautiful place like, it? Ah! she could say. And strange, true, one say; oftenest it, even nearest it, say least it, make people understand least like. There good many folks Other-end-of-Nowhere (where Tom went afterwards), pretend know north south well penny postmen there; but, safe Other-end-of-Nowhere, nine hundred ninety-nine million miles away, say cannot concern us. But dear, sweet, loving, wise, good, self-sacrificing people, really go there, never tell anything it, save beautiful place world; and, ask more, grow modest, hold peace, fear laughed at; quite right are. So good little Ellie could say was, worth rest world put together. And course made Tom anxious go likewise. “Miss Ellie,” he said last, “I know I cannot go go home Sundays, I shall peace, give none either.” “You must ask fairies that.” So fairy, Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, came next, Tom asked her. “Little boys fit play sea-beasts cannot go there,” she said. “Those go must go first like, like, help somebody like.” “Why, Ellie that?” “Ask her.” And Ellie blushed, said, “Yes, Tom; I like coming first; I much happier home, always Sunday. And I afraid you, Tom, first, because—because—” “Because I prickles? But I prickly now, I, Miss Ellie?” “No,” said Ellie. “I like much now; I like coming here, too.” “And perhaps,” said fairy, “you learn like going do not like, helping one do not like, Ellie has.” But Tom put his finger his mouth, hung his head down; he see all. So Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby came, Tom asked her; he thought his little head, She strict her sister, perhaps she may let easily. Ah, Tom, Tom, silly fellow! yet I do not know I blame you, many grown people got notion heads. But, try it, get answer Tom did. For, he asked second fairy, she told first did, words. Tom unhappy that. And, Ellie went home Sunday, he fretted cried day, care listen fairy’s stories good children, though prettier ever. Indeed, he overheard them, less he liked listen, children like, took trouble people, worked feed little brothers sisters instead caring play. And, she began tell story holy child old times, martyred heathen would worship idols, Tom could bear more, ran away hid among rocks. And, Ellie came back, he shy her, he fancied she looked him, thought coward. And he grew quite cross her, she superior him, he could do. And poor Ellie quite surprised sad; last Tom burst crying; he would tell her really his mind. And he eaten curiosity know Ellie went to; he began care his playmates, sea-palace anything else. But perhaps made matters easier him; he grew discontented everything round he care stay, care he went. “Well,” he said, last, “I miserable here, I will go; go me?” “Ah!” said Ellie, “I wish I might; worst is, fairy says must go alone go all. Now do not poke poor crab about, Tom” (for he feeling naughty mischievous), “or fairy punish you.” Tom nearly saying, “I do not care she does;” he stopped time. “I know she wants do,” he said, whining dolefully. “She wants go horrid old Grimes. I do not like him, that is certain. And I find him, he turn chimney-sweep again, I know. That is I afraid along.” “No, he will not—I know much that. Nobody turn water-babies sweeps, hurt all, long good.” “Ah,” said naughty Tom, “I see want; persuading along go, tired me, want get rid me.” Little Ellie opened her eyes wide that, brimming tears. “Oh, Tom, Tom!” she said, mournfully—and she cried, “Oh, Tom! you?” And Tom cried, “Oh, Ellie, you?” For neither could see other—not least. Little Ellie vanished quite away, Tom heard her voice calling him, growing smaller smaller, fainter fainter, till silent. Who frightened Tom? He swam among rocks, halls chambers, faster ever he swam before, could find her. He shouted her, she answer; he asked children, seen her; last he went top water began crying screaming Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid—which perhaps best thing do—for she came moment. “Oh!” said Tom. “Oh dear, oh dear! I naughty Ellie, I killed her—I know I killed her.” “Not quite that,” said fairy; “but I sent her away home, she come back I know long.” And Tom cried bitterly salt sea swelled his tears, tide .3,954,620,819 inch higher day before: perhaps owing waxing moon. It may so; considered right new philosophy, know, give spiritual causes physical phenomena—especially parlour-tables; and, course, physical causes spiritual ones, like thinking, praying, knowing right wrong. And odds till comes even, folks say Berkshire. “How cruel send Ellie away!” sobbed Tom. “However, I find her again, I go world’s end look her.” The fairy slap Tom, tell hold his tongue: she took her lap kindly, her sister would done; put mind her fault, she wound inside, like watches, could help things whether she liked not. And she told he nursery long enough, must go see world, he intended ever man; he must go alone himself, every one else ever born go, see his eyes, smell his nose, make his bed lie it, burn his fingers he put fire. And she told many fine things seen world, odd, curious, pleasant, orderly, respectable, well-managed, and, whole, successful (as, indeed, might expected) sort place was, people would tolerably brave honest good it; she told afraid anything he met, nothing would harm he remembered his lessons, he knew right. And last she comforted poor little Tom much he quite eager go, wanted set minute. “Only,” he said, “if I might see Ellie I went!” “Why want that?” “Because—because I much happier I thought she forgiven me.” And twinkling eye stood Ellie, smiling, looking happy Tom longed kiss her; still afraid would respectful, she lady born. “I going, Ellie!” said Tom. “I going, world’s end. But I do not like going all, that is truth.” “Pooh! pooh! pooh!” said fairy. “You like well indeed, little rogue, know bottom heart. But do not, I make like it. Come here, see happens people pleasant.” And she took one her cupboards (she sorts mysterious cupboards cracks rocks) wonderful waterproof book, full photographs never seen. For she found photography (and fact) 13,598,000 years anybody born; and, more, her photographs merely represent light shade, do, colour also, colours, may see look black-cock’s tail, butterfly’s wing, indeed things be, speak. And therefore her photographs curious famous, children looked great delight opening book. And title-page written, “The History great famous nation Doasyoulikes, came away country Hardwork, wanted play Jews’ harp day long.” In first picture saw Doasyoulikes living land Readymade, foot Happy-go-lucky Mountains, flapdoodle grows wild; want know is, must read Peter Simple. They lived much life jolly old Greeks Sicily, may see painted ancient vases, really seemed great excuses them, need work. Instead houses lived beautiful caves tufa, bathed warm springs three times day; and, clothes, warm gentlemen walked little beside cocked hat pair straps, light summer tackle kind; ladies gathered gossamer autumn (when lazy) make winter dresses. They fond music, much trouble learn piano violin; dancing, would great exertion. So sat ant-hills day long, played Jews’ harp; and, ants bit them, got went next ant-hill, till bitten likewise. And sat flapdoodle-trees, let flapdoodle drop mouths; vines, squeezed grape-juice throats; and, little pigs ran ready roasted, crying, “Come eat me,” fashion country, waited till pigs ran mouths, took bite, content, many oysters would been. They needed weapons, enemies ever came near land; tools, everything readymade hand; stern old fairy Necessity never came near hunt up, make use wits, die. And on, on, on, till never comfortable, easy-going, happy-go-lucky people world. “Well, jolly life,” said Tom. “You think so?” said fairy. “Do see great peaked mountain behind,” said fairy, “with smoke coming top?” “Yes.” “And see ashes, slag, cinders lying about?” “Yes.” “Then turn next five hundred years, see happens next.” And behold mountain blown like barrel gunpowder, boiled like kettle; whereby one-third Doasyoulikes blown air, another third smothered ashes; one-third left. “You see,” said fairy, “what comes living burning mountain.” “Oh, warn them?” said little Ellie. “I warn I could. I let smoke come mountain; wherever smoke fire. And I laid ashes cinders about; wherever cinders, cinders may again. But like face facts, dears, people do; invented cock-and-bull story, which, I sure, I never told them, smoke breath giant, gods buried mountain; cinders dwarfs roasted little pigs whole with; nonsense kind. And, folks humour, I cannot teach them, save good old birch-rod.” And she turned next five hundred years: remnant Doasyoulikes, liked, before. They lazy move away mountain; said, If blown once, reason blow again. And number: said, The merrier, fewer better fare. However, quite true; flapdoodle-trees killed volcano, eaten roast pigs, who, course, could expected little ones. So live hard, nuts roots scratched ground sticks. Some talked sowing corn, ancestors used do, came land Readymade; forgotten make ploughs (they forgotten even make Jews’ harps time), eaten seed-corn brought land Hardwork years since; course much trouble go away find more. So lived miserably roots nuts, weakly little children great stomachs, died. “Why,” said Tom, “they growing better savages.” “And look ugly getting,” said Ellie. “Yes; people live poor vegetables instead roast beef plum-pudding, jaws grow large, lips grow coarse, like poor Paddies eat potatoes.” And she turned next five hundred years. And living trees, making nests keep rain. And underneath trees lions prowling about. “Why,” said Ellie, “the lions seem eaten good many them, left now.” “Yes,” said fairy; “you see strongest active ones could climb trees, escape.” “But great, hulking, broad-shouldered chaps are,” said Tom; “they rough lot ever I saw.” “Yes, getting strong now; ladies marry strongest fiercest gentlemen, help trees lions’ way.” And she turned next five hundred years. And fewer still, stronger, fiercer; feet changed shape oddly, laid hold branches great toes, thumbs, Hindoo tailor uses his toes thread his needle. The children much surprised, asked fairy whether her doing. “Yes, no,” she said, smiling. “It could use feet well hands could get good living: or, indeed, get married; got best everything, starved rest; left keep regular breed toe-thumb-men, breed short-horns, skye-terriers, fancy pigeons kept up.” “But hairy one among them,” said Ellie. “Ah!” said fairy, “that great man his time, chief tribe.” And, she turned next five hundred years, true. For hairy chief hairy children, hairier children still; every one wished marry hairy husbands, hairy children too; climate growing damp none hairy ones could live: rest coughed sneezed, sore throats, went consumptions, could grow men women. Then fairy turned next five hundred years. And fewer still. “Why, one ground picking roots,” said Ellie, “and he cannot walk upright.” No he could; way shape feet altered, shape backs altered also. “Why,” cried Tom, “I declare apes.” “Something fearfully like it, poor foolish creatures,” said fairy. “They grown stupid now, hardly think: none used wits many hundred years. They almost forgotten, too, talk. For stupid child forgot words heard stupid parents, wits enough make fresh words itself. Beside, grown fierce suspicious brutal keep other’s way, mope sulk dark forests, never hearing other’s voice, till forgotten almost speech like. I afraid apes soon, liked.” And next five hundred years dead gone, bad food wild beasts hunters; except one tremendous old fellow jaws like jack, stood full seven feet high; M. Du Chaillu came him, shot him, he stood roaring thumping his breast. And he remembered his ancestors men, tried say, “Am I man brother?” forgotten use his tongue; he tried call doctor, he forgotten word one. So he said “Ubboboo!” died. And end great jolly nation Doasyoulikes. And, Tom Ellie came end book, looked sad solemn; good reason do, really fancied men apes, never thought, simplicity, asking whether creatures hippopotamus majors brains not; case, told already, could possibly apes, though apish apes aperies. “But could saved becoming apes?” said little Ellie, last. “At first, dear; would behaved like men, set work like. But longer waited, behaved like dumb beasts, like, stupider clumsier grew; till last past cure, thrown wits away. It things help make ugly, I know I shall grow fair.” “And now?” asked Ellie. “Exactly ought be, dear.” “Yes!” said fairy, solemnly, half herself, she closed wonderful book. “Folks say I make beasts men, circumstance, selection, competition, forth. Well, perhaps right; perhaps, again, wrong. That one seven things I forbidden tell, till coming Cocqcigrues; and, events, concern theirs. Whatever ancestors were, men are; I advise behave such, act accordingly. But let recollect this, two sides every question, downhill well uphill road; and, I turn beasts men, I can, laws circumstance, selection, competition, turn men beasts. You near turned beast twice, little Tom. Indeed, made mind go journey, see world, like Englishman, I sure would ended eft pond.” “Oh, dear me!” said Tom; “sooner that, slime, I will go minute, world’s end.” CHAPTER VII “And Nature, old Nurse, took The child upon her knee, Saying, ‘Here story book Thy father hath written thee. “‘Come wander me,’ she said, ‘Into regions yet untrod, And read still unread In Manuscripts God.’ “And he wandered away away With Nature, dear old Nurse, Who sang night day The rhymes universe.” LONGFELLOW. “NOW,” said Tom, “I ready off, it is world’s end.” “Ah!” said fairy, “that brave, good boy. But must go farther world’s end, want find Mr. Grimes; he Other-end-of-Nowhere. You must go Shiny Wall, white gate never opened; come Peacepool, Mother Carey’s Haven, good whales go die. And Mother Carey tell way Other-end-of-Nowhere, find Mr. Grimes.” “Oh, dear!” said Tom. “But I know way Shiny Wall, all.” “Little boys must take trouble find things themselves, never grow men; must ask beasts sea birds air, good them, tell way Shiny Wall.” “Well,” said Tom, “it long journey, I better start once. Good-bye, Miss Ellie; know I getting big boy, I must go see world.” “I know must,” said Ellie; “but forget me, Tom. I shall wait till come.” And she shook hands him, bade good-bye. Tom longed much kiss her; he thought would respectful, considering she lady born; he promised forget her: his little whirl-about head full notion going see world, forgot her five minutes: however, though his head forgot her, I glad say his heart not. So he asked beasts sea, birds air, none knew way Shiny Wall. For why? He still far south. Then he met ship, far larger he ever seen—a gallant ocean-steamer, long cloud smoke trailing behind; he wondered she went without sails, swam her see. A school dolphins running races round round her, going three feet her one, Tom asked way Shiny Wall: know. Then he tried find she moved, last he saw her screw, delighted he played her quarter day, till he nearly his nose knocked fans, thought time move. Then he watched sailors upon deck, ladies, bonnets parasols: none could see him, eyes opened,—as, indeed, people’s eyes not. At last came quarter-gallery pretty lady, deep black widow’s weeds, her arms baby. She leaned quarter-gallery, looked back back toward England far away; she looked she sang: I. “_Soft soft wind_, _from sweet south sliding_, _Waft thy silver cloud-webs athwart summer sea_; _Thin thin threads mist dewy fingers twining_ _Weave veil dappled gauze shade babe me_. II. “_Deep deep Love_, _within thine abyss abiding_, _Pour Thyself abroad_, _O Lord_, _on earth air sea_; _Worn weary hearts within Thy holy temple hiding_, _Shield sorrow_, _sin_, _and shame helpless babe me_.” Her voice soft low, music air sweet, Tom could listened day. But she held baby gallery rail, show dolphins leaping water gurgling ship’s wake, lo! behold, baby saw Tom. He quite sure eyes met, baby smiled held his hands; Tom smiled held his hands too; baby kicked leaped, wanted jump overboard him. “What see, darling?” said lady; her eyes followed baby’s till she caught sight Tom, swimming among foam-beads below. She gave little shriek start; she said, quite quietly, “Babies sea? Well, perhaps happiest place them;” waved her hand Tom, cried, “Wait little, darling, little: perhaps shall go rest.” And old nurse, black, came talked her, drew her in. And Tom turned away northward, sad wondering; watched great steamer slide away dusk, lights board peep one one, die again, long bar smoke fade away evening mist, till sight. And he swam northward again, day day, till last he met King Herrings, curry-comb growing his nose, sprat his mouth cigar, asked way Shiny Wall; he bolted his sprat head foremost, said: “If I you, young Gentleman, I go Allalonestone, ask last Gairfowl. She ancient clan, nearly ancient own; knows good deal modern upstarts do not, ladies old houses likely do.” Tom asked his way her, King Herrings told kindly, he courteous old gentleman old school, though he horribly ugly, strangely bedizened too, like old dandies lounge club-house windows. But Tom thanked set off, he called him: “Hi! I say, fly?” “I never tried,” says Tom. “Why?” “Because, can, I advise say nothing old lady it. There; take hint. Good-bye.” And away Tom went seven days seven nights due north-west, till he came great codbank, like he never saw before. The great cod lay tens thousands, gobbled she will-fish day long; blue sharks roved hundreds, gobbled came up. So ate, ate, ate other, done since making world; man come yet catch them, find rich old Mother Carey is. And he saw last Gairfowl, standing Allalonestones alone. And grand old lady she was, full three feet high, bolt upright, like old Highland chieftainess. She black velvet gown, white pinner apron, high bridge her nose (which sure mark high breeding), large pair white spectacles it, made her look rather odd: ancient fashion her house. And instead wings, she two little feathery arms, she fanned herself, complained dreadful heat; she kept crooning old song herself, she learnt she little baby-bird, long ago— “_Two little birds sat stone_, _One swam away_, _and one_, _With fal-lal-la-lady_. “_The swam after_, _and none_, _And poor stone left alone_; _With fal-lal-la-lady_.” It “flew” away, properly, “swam” away: but, she could fly, she right alter it. However, fit song her sing, she lady herself. Tom came her humbly, made his bow; first thing she said was— “Have wings? Can fly?” “Oh dear, no, madam; I think thing,” said cunning little Tom. “Then I shall great pleasure talking you, dear. It quite refreshing nowadays see anything without wings. They must wings, forsooth, now, every new upstart sort bird, fly. What want flying, raising proper station life? In days ancestors birds ever thought wings, well without; laugh I keep good old fashion. Why, marrocks dovekies got wings, vulgar creatures, poor little ones enough are; cousins too, razor-bills, gentlefolk born, ought know better ape inferiors.” And she running on, Tom tried get word edgeways; last he did, old lady got breath, began fanning herself again; he asked she knew way Shiny Wall. “Shiny Wall? Who know better I? We came Shiny Wall, thousands years ago, decently cold, climate fit gentlefolk; now, heat, vulgar-winged things fly eat everything, gentlepeople’s hunting spoilt, one really cannot get one’s living, hardly venture rock fear flown creature would dared come within mile one thousand years ago—what I saying? Why, quite gone world, dear, nothing left honour. And I last family. A friend mine I came settled rock young, way low people. Once great nation, spread Northern Isles. But men shot us so, knocked us head, took eggs—why, believe it, say coast Labrador sailors used lay plank rock board thing called ship, drive us along plank hundreds, till tumbled ship’s waist heaps; then, I suppose, ate us, nasty fellows! Well—but—what I saying? At last, none us left, except old Gairfowlskerry, Iceland coast, man could climb. Even peace; one day, I quite young girl, land rocked, sea boiled, sky grew dark, air filled smoke dust, tumbled old Gairfowlskerry sea. The dovekies marrocks, course, flew away; proud that. Some us dashed pieces, drowned; left got away Eldey, dovekies tell dead now, another Gairfowlskerry risen sea close old one, poor flat place safe live on: I left alone.” This Gairfowl’s story, and, strange may seem, every word true. “If wings!” said Tom; “then might flown away too.” “Yes, young gentleman: people gentleman ladies, forget _noblesse oblige_, find easy get world people do not care do. Why, I recollected _noblesse oblige_, I alone now.” And poor old lady sighed. “How that, madam?” “Why, dear, gentleman came hither me, time, he wanted marry—in fact, he actually proposed me. Well, I cannot blame him; I young, handsome then, I do not deny: see, I could hear thing, he deceased sister’s husband, see?” “Of course not, madam,” said Tom; though, course, he knew nothing it. “She much diseased, I suppose?” “You understand me, dear. I mean, lady, right honourable feelings, house always had, I felt duty snub him, howk him, peck continually, keep his proper distance; and, tell truth, I pecked little hard, poor fellow, he tumbled backwards rock, and—really, unfortunate, fault—a shark coming saw flapping, snapped up. And since I lived alone— ‘_With fal-lal-la-lady_.’ And soon I shall gone, little dear, nobody miss me; poor stone left alone.” “But, please, way Shiny Wall?” said Tom. “Oh, must go, little dear—you must go. Let see—I sure—that is—really, poor old brains getting quite puzzled. Do know, little dear, I afraid, want know, must ask vulgar birds about, I quite forgotten.” And poor old Gairfowl began cry tears pure oil; Tom quite sorry her; too, he his wit’s end ask. But came flock petrels, Mother Carey’s chickens; Tom thought much prettier Lady Gairfowl, perhaps were; Mother Carey great deal fresh experience time she invented Gairfowl time she invented them. They flitted along like flock black swallows, hopped skipped wave wave, lifting little feet behind daintily, whistling tenderly, Tom fell love once, called know way Shiny Wall. “Shiny Wall? Do want Shiny Wall? Then come us, show you. We Mother Carey’s chickens, she sends us seas, show good birds way home.” Tom delighted, swam them, he made his bow Gairfowl. But she would return his bow: held herself bolt upright, wept tears oil she sang: “_And poor stone left alone_; _With fal-lal-la-lady_.” But she wrong there; stone left alone: next time Tom goes it, he see sight worth seeing. The old Gairfowl gone already: better things come her place; Tom comes he see fishing-smacks anchored hundreds, Scotland, Ireland, Orkneys, Shetlands, Northern ports, full children old Norse Vikings, masters sea. And men hauling great cod thousands, till hands sore lines; making cod-liver oil guano, salting fish; man-of-war steamer protect them, lighthouse show way; I, perhaps, shall go day Allalonestone great summer sea-fair, dredge strange creatures man never saw before; shall hear sailors boast worst jewel Queen Victoria’s crown, eighty miles codbank, food poor folk land. That Tom see, perhaps I shall see too. And shall sorry cannot get Gairfowl stuff, much less find gairfowl enough drive stone pens slaughter them, old Norsemen did, drive board along plank till ship victualled them, old English French rovers used do, dear old Hakluyt tells: shall remember Mr. Tennyson says: “_The old order changeth_, _giving place new_, _And God fulfils many ways_.” And Tom agog start Shiny Wall; petrels said no. They must go first Allfowlsness, wait great gathering sea-birds, start summer breeding-places far away Northern Isles; would sure find birds going Shiny Wall: Allfowlsness was, he must promise never tell, lest men go shoot birds, stuff them, put stupid museums, instead leaving play breed work Mother Carey’s water-garden, ought be. So Allfowlsness nobody must know; said is, Tom waited many days; he waited, he saw curious sight. On rabbit burrows shore gathered hundreds hundreds hoodie-crows, see Cambridgeshire. And made noise, Tom came shore went see matter. And he found holding great caucus, hold every year North; stump-orators speechifying; tribune, speaker stood old sheep’s skull. And cawed cawed, boasted clever things done; many lambs’ eyes picked out, many dead bullocks eaten, many young grouse swallowed whole, many grouse-eggs flown away with, stuck point bills, hoodie-crow’s particularly clever feat, he proud gipsy hokany-baro; is, I will not tell you. And last brought prettiest, neatest young lady-crow ever seen, set her middle, began abusing vilifying, rating, bullyragging her, she stolen grouse-eggs, actually dared say she would steal any. So she tried publicly laws (for hoodies always try offenders great yearly parliament). And she stood middle, her black gown gray hood, looking meek neat Quakeress, bawled her once— And vain she pleaded— _That she like grouse-eggs_; _That she could get her living well without them_; _That she afraid eat them_, _for fear gamekeepers_; _That she heart eat them_, _because grouse pretty_, _kind_, _jolly birds_; _And dozen reasons more_. For scaul-crows set upon her, pecked her death then, Tom could come help her; flew away, proud done. Now, scandalous transaction? But true republicans, hoodies, every one he likes, make people too; that, freedom speech, thought, action, allowed among them, might well American citizens new school. But fairies took good crow, gave her nine new sets feathers running, turned her last beautiful bird paradise green velvet suit long tail, sent her eat fruit Spice Islands, cloves nutmegs grow. And Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid settled her account wicked hoodies. For, flew away, find nasty dead dog?—on set work, peeking gobbling cawing quarrelling hearts’ content. But moment afterwards, threw bills air, gave one screech; turned head heels backward, fell dead, one hundred twenty-three once. For why? The fairy told gamekeeper dream, fill dead dog full strychnine; he did. And birds began gather Allfowlsness, thousands tens thousands, blackening air; swans brant geese, harlequins eiders, harolds garganeys, smews goosanders, divers loons, grebes dovekies, auks razor-bills, gannets petrels, skuas terns, gulls beyond naming numbering; paddled washed splashed combed brushed sand, till shore white feathers; quacked clucked gabbled chattered screamed whooped talked matters friends, settled go breed summer, till might heard ten miles off; lucky one hear old keeper, lived alone upon Ness, turf hut thatched heather fringed round great stones slung across roof bent-ropes, lest winter gales blow hut right away. But he never minded birds hurt them, season; indeed, he minded two things whole world, were, his Bible his grouse; he good old Scotchman ever knit stockings winter’s night: only, birds going, he toddled out, took his cap them, wished merry journey safe return; gathered feathers left, cleaned sell south, make feather-beds stuffy people lie on. Then petrels asked bird whether would take Tom Shiny Wall: one set going Sutherland, one Shetlands, one Norway, one Spitzbergen, one Iceland, one Greenland: none would go Shiny Wall. So good-natured petrels said would show part way themselves, going far Jan Mayen’s Land; he must shift himself. And birds rose up, streamed away long black lines, north, north-east, north-west, across bright blue summer sky; cry like ten thousand packs hounds, ten thousand peals bells. Only puffins stayed behind, killed young rabbits, laid eggs rabbit-burrows; rough practice, certainly; man must see his family. And, Tom petrels went north-eastward, began blow right hard; old gentleman gray great-coat, looks big copper boiler, gulf Mexico, got behindhand his work; Mother Carey sent electric message steam; steam coming, much hour ought come week, puffing roaring swishing swirling, till could see sky ended sea began. But Tom petrels never cared, gale right abaft, away went crests billows, merry many flying-fish. And last saw ugly sight—the black side great ship, waterlogged trough sea. Her funnel her masts overboard, swayed surged her lee; her decks swept clean barn floor, living soul board. The petrels flew her, wailed round her; sorry indeed, also expected find salt pork; Tom scrambled board her looked round, frightened sad. And there, little cot, lashed tight bulwark, lay baby fast asleep; baby, Tom saw once, he seen singing lady’s arms. He went it, wanted wake it; behold, cot jumped little black tan terrier dog, began barking snapping Tom, would let touch cot. Tom knew dog’s teeth could hurt him: least could shove away, did; he dog fought struggled, he wanted help baby, want throw poor dog overboard: struggling came tall green sea, walked weather side ship, swept waves. “Oh, baby, baby!” screamed Tom: next moment he scream all; he saw cot settling green water, baby, smiling it, fast asleep; he saw fairies come below, carry baby cradle gently soft arms; he knew right, would new water-baby St. Brandan’s Isle. And poor little dog? Why, he kicked coughed little, he sneezed hard, he sneezed clean his skin, turned water-dog, jumped danced round Tom, ran crests waves, snapped jelly-fish mackerel, followed Tom whole way Other-end-of-Nowhere. Then went again, till began see peak Jan Mayen’s Land, standing-up like white sugar-loaf, two miles clouds. And fell whole flock molly-mocks, feeding dead whale. “These fellows show way,” said Mother Carey’s chickens; “we cannot help farther north. We do not like get among ice pack, fear nip toes: mollys dare fly anywhere.” So petrels called mollys: busy greedy, gobbling peeking spluttering fighting blubber, take least notice. “Come, come,” said petrels, “you lazy greedy lubbers, young gentleman going Mother Carey, do not attend him, will not earn discharge her, know.” “Greedy are,” says great fat old molly, “but lazy are not; and, lubbers, we are lubbers you. Let us look lad.” And he flapped right Tom’s face, stared impudent way (for mollys audacious fellows, whalers know), asked he hailed from, land he sighted last. And, Tom told him, he seemed pleased, said he good plucked one got far. “Come along, lads,” he said rest, “and give little chap cast pack, Mother Carey’s sake. We have eaten blubber enough to-day, we will e’en work bit time helping lad.” So mollys took Tom backs, flew him, laughing joking—and oh, smell train oil! “Who you, jolly birds?” asked Tom. “We spirits old Greenland skippers (as every sailor knows), hunted here, right whales horse-whales, full hundreds years agone. But, saucy greedy, turned mollys, eat whale’s blubber days. But lubbers none, could sail ship man North seas, though do not hold new-fangled steam. And it is shame black imps petrels call us so; they are her grace’s pets, think may say anything like.” “And you?” asked Tom him, he saw he king birds. “My name Hendrick Hudson, right good skipper I; name last world’s end, spite wrong I did. For I discovered Hudson River, I named Hudson’s Bay; many come wake dared shown way. But I hard man time, that is truth, stole poor Indians coast Maine, sold slaves Virginia; last I cruel sailors, seas, set adrift open boat, I never heard more. So I am king mollys, till I have worked time.” And came edge pack, beyond could see Shiny Wall looming, mist, snow, storm. But pack rolled horribly upon swell, ice giants fought roared, leapt upon other’s backs, ground powder, Tom afraid venture among them, lest he ground powder too. And he afraid, he saw lying among ice pack wrecks many gallant ship; masts yards standing, seamen frozen fast board. Alas, alas, them! They true English hearts; came end like good knights-errant, searching white gate never opened yet. But good mollys took Tom his dog up, flew safe pack roaring ice giants, set foot Shiny Wall. “And gate?” asked Tom. “There gate,” said mollys. “No gate?” cried Tom, aghast. “None; never crack one, that is whole secret, better fellows, lad, found cost; been, they would killed every right whale swims sea.” “What I do, then?” “Dive floe, sure, pluck.” “I have come far turn now,” said Tom; “so goes header.” “A lucky voyage you, lad,” said mollys; “we knew one right sort. So good-bye.” “Why do not come too?” asked Tom. But mollys wailed sadly, “We cannot go yet, cannot go yet,” flew away pack. So Tom dived great white gate never opened yet, went black darkness, bottom sea, seven days seven nights. And yet he bit frightened. Why he be? He brave English lad, whose business go see world. And last he saw light, clear clear water overhead; he came thousand fathoms, among clouds sea-moths, fluttered round his head. There moths pink heads wings opal bodies, flapped slowly; moths brown wings flapped quickly; yellow shrimps hopped skipped quickly all; jellies colours world, neither hopped skipped, dawdled yawned, would get his way. The dog snapped till his jaws tired; Tom hardly minded all, he eager get top water, see pool good whales go. And large pool was, miles miles across, though air clear ice cliffs opposite side looked close hand. All round ice cliffs rose, walls spires battlements, caves bridges, stories galleries, ice-fairies live, drive away storms clouds, Mother Carey’s pool may lie calm year’s end year’s end. And sun acted policeman, walked round outside every day, peeping top ice wall, see went right; he played conjuring tricks, exhibition fireworks, amuse ice-fairies. For he would make four five suns once, paint sky rings crosses crescents white fire, stick middle them, wink fairies; I daresay much amused; anything’s fun country. And good whales lay, happy sleepy beasts, upon still oily sea. They right whales, must know, finners, razor-backs, bottle-noses, spotted sea-unicorns long ivory horns. But sperm whales raging, ramping, roaring, rumbustious fellows, that, Mother Carey let in, would peace Peacepool. So she packs away great pond South Pole, two hundred sixty-three miles south-south-east Mount Erebus, great volcano ice; butt ugly noses, day night year’s end year’s end. But good quiet beasts, lying like black hulls sloops, blowing every jets white steam, sculling round huge mouths open, sea-moths swim throats. There threshers thresh poor old backs, sword-fish stab stomachs, saw-fish rip up, ice-sharks bite lumps sides, whalers harpoon lance them. They quite safe happy there; wait quietly Peacepool, till Mother Carey sent make old beasts new. Tom swam nearest whale, asked way Mother Carey. “There she sits middle,” said whale. Tom looked; he could see nothing middle pool, one peaked iceberg: he said so. “That is Mother Carey,” said whale, “as find get her. There she sits making old beasts new year round.” “How she that?” “That is her concern, mine,” said old whale; yawned wide (for he large) swam his mouth 943 sea-moths, 13,846 jelly-fish bigger pins’ heads, string salpæ nine yards long, forty-three little ice-crabs, gave parting pinch round, tucked legs stomachs, determined die decently, like Julius Cæsar. “I suppose,” said Tom, “she cuts great whale like whole shoal porpoises?” At old whale laughed violently he coughed creatures; swam away thankful escaped terrible whalebone net his, bourne traveller returns; Tom went iceberg, wondering. And, he came near it, took form grandest old lady he ever seen—a white marble lady, sitting white marble throne. And foot throne swum away, sea, millions new-born creatures, shapes colours man ever dreamed. And Mother Carey’s children, she makes sea-water day long. He expected, course—like grown people ought know better—to find her snipping, piecing, fitting, stitching, cobbling, basting, filing, planing, hammering, turning, polishing, moulding, measuring, chiselling, clipping, forth, men go work make anything. But, instead that, she sat quite still her chin upon her hand, looking sea two great grand blue eyes, blue sea itself. Her hair white snow—for she old—in fact, old anything likely come across, except difference right wrong. And, she saw Tom, she looked kindly. “What want, little man? It long since I seen water-baby here.” Tom told her his errand, asked way Other-end-of-Nowhere. “You ought know yourself, already.” “Have I, madam? I am sure I forget it.” “Then look me.” And, Tom looked her great blue eyes, he recollected way perfectly. Now, strange? “Thank you, madam,” said Tom. “Then I will not trouble ladyship more; I hear busy.” “I never busy I now,” she said, without stirring finger. “I heard, madam, always making new beasts old.” “So people fancy. But I going trouble make things, little dear. I sit make make themselves.” “You clever fairy, indeed,” thought Tom. And he quite right. That grand trick good old Mother Carey’s, grand answer, she occasion make several times impertinent people. There once, instance, fairy clever she found make butterflies. I do not mean sham ones; no: real live ones, would fly, eat, lay eggs, everything ought; she proud her skill she went flying straight North Pole, boast Mother Carey she could make butterflies. But Mother Carey laughed. “Know, silly child,” she said, “that one make things, take time trouble enough: every one who, like me, make things make themselves.” But people yet believe Mother Carey clever comes to; till they, too, go journey Other-end-of-Nowhere. “And now, pretty little man,” said Mother Carey, “you sure know way Other-end-of-Nowhere?” Tom thought; behold, he forgotten utterly. “That took eyes me.” Tom looked her again, recollected; looked away, forgot instant. “But I do, madam? For I cannot keep looking I somewhere else.” “You must without me, people do, nine hundred ninety-nine thousandths lives; look dog instead; he knows way well enough, forget it. Besides, may meet queer-tempered people there, let pass without passport mine, must hang round neck take care of; and, course, dog always go behind you, must go whole way backward.” “Backward!” cried Tom. “Then I shall able see way.” “On contrary, look forward, see step you, certain go wrong; but, look behind you, watch carefully whatever passed, especially keep eye dog, goes instinct, therefore cannot go wrong, know coming next, plainly saw looking-glass.” Tom much astonished: he obeyed her, he learnt always believe fairies told him. “So is, dear child,” said Mother Carey; “and I tell story, show I perfectly right, custom be. “Once time, two brothers. One called Prometheus, he always looked him, boasted he wise beforehand. The called Epimetheus, he always looked behind him, boast all; said humbly, like Irishman, he sooner prophesy event. “Well, Prometheus clever fellow, course, invented sorts wonderful things. But, unfortunately, set work, work would do: wherefore little come them, little left them; nobody knows were, save archæological old gentlemen scratch queer corners, find little save Ptinum Furem, Blaptem Mortisagam, Acarum Horridum, Tineam Laciniarum. “But Epimetheus slow fellow, certainly, went among men clod, muff, milksop, slowcoach, bloke, boodle, forth. And little he did, many years: he did, he never again. “And happened last? There came two brothers beautiful creature ever seen, Pandora name; means, All gifts Gods. But she strange box her hand, fanciful, forecasting, suspicious, prudential, theoretical, deductive, prophesying Prometheus, always settling going happen, would nothing pretty Pandora her box. “But Epimetheus took her it, he took everything came; married her better worse, every man ought, whenever he even chance good wife. And opened box them, course, see inside: for, else, possible use could them? “And flew ills flesh heir to; children four great bogies, Self-will, Ignorance, Fear, Dirt—for instance: _Measles_, _Famines_, _Monks_, _Quacks_, _Scarlatina_, _Unpaid bills_, _Idols_, _Tight stays_, _Hooping-coughs_, _Potatoes_, _Popes_, _Bad Wine_, _Wars_, _Despots_, _Peacemongers_, _Demagogues_, _And_, _worst all_, _Naughty Boys Girls_. But one thing remained bottom box, was, Hope. “So Epimetheus got great deal trouble, men world: he got three best things world bargain—a good wife, experience, hope: Prometheus much trouble, great deal (as hear), his making; nothing beside, save fancies spun his brain, spider spins her web her stomach. “And Prometheus kept looking far ahead, he running box lucifers (which useful things he ever invented, much harm good), he trod his nose, tumbled (as deductive philosophers do), whereby he set Thames fire; hardly put yet. So he chained top mountain, vulture give peck whenever he stirred, lest he turn whole world upside his prophecies his theories. “But stupid old Epimetheus went working grubbing on, help his wife Pandora, always looking behind see happened, till he really learnt know would happen next; understood well side his bread buttered, way cat jumped, he began make things would work, go working, too; till drain ground, make looms, ships, railroads, steam ploughs, electric telegraphs, things see Great Exhibition; foretell famine, bad weather, price stocks (what hardest all) next vagary great idol Whirligig, call Public Opinion; till last he grew rich Jew, fat farmer, people thought twice meddled him, asked help them; for, he earned his money well, he could afford spend well likewise. “And his children men science, get good lasting work done world; children Prometheus fanatics, theorists, bigots, bores, noisy windy people, go telling silly folk happen, instead looking see happened already.” Now, Mother Carey’s wonderful story? And, I happy say, Tom believed every word. For happened Tom likewise. He sorely tried; though, keeping dog heels (or rather toes, he walk backward), he could see pretty well way dog hunting, yet much slower work go backwards go forwards. But, trying still, sooner he got Peacepool, came running conjurors, fortune-tellers, astrologers, prophesiers, projectors, prestigiators, many parts (and many everywhere), Old Mother Shipton her broomstick, Merlin, Thomas Rhymer, Gerbertus, Rabanus Maurus, Nostradamus, Zadkiel, Raphael, Moore, Old Nixon, good many black coats white ties might known better, considering century born, bawling screaming him, “Look a-head, look a-head; show man never saw before, right away end world!” But I proud say that, though Tom Cambridge—for, he had, he would certainly senior wrangler—he little dogged, hard, gnarly, foursquare brick English boy, he never turned his head round way Peacepool Other-end-of-Nowhere: kept his eye dog, let pick scent, hot cold, straight crooked, wet dry, hill dale; means he never made single mistake, saw wonderful hitherto by-no-mortal-man-imagined things, duty relate next chapter. CHAPTER VIII AND LAST “Come me, O ye children! For I hear play; And questions perplexed Have vanished quite away. “Ye open Eastern windows, That look towards sun, Where thoughts singing swallows, And brooks morning run. “For contrivings And wisdom books, When compared caresses, And gladness looks? “Ye better ballads That ever sung said; For ye living poems, And rest dead.” LONGFELLOW. HERE begins never-to-be-too-much-studied account nine-hundred-and-ninety-ninth part wonderful things Tom saw his journey Other-end-of-Nowhere; good little children requested read; that, ever get Other-end-of-Nowhere, may probably do, may burst laughing, try run away, silly vulgar thing may offend Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid. Now, soon Tom left Peacepool, he came white lap great sea-mother, ten thousand fathoms deep; she makes world-pap day long, steam-giants knead, fire-giants bake, till risen hardened mountain-loaves island-cakes. And Tom near kneaded world-pap, turned fossil water-baby; would astonished Geological Society New Zealand hundreds thousands years hence. For, he walked along silence sea-twilight, soft white ocean floor, he aware hissing, roaring, thumping, pumping, steam-engines world once. And, he came near, water grew boiling-hot; hurt least: also grew foul gruel; every moment he stumbled dead shells, fish, sharks, seals, whales, killed hot water. And last he came great sea-serpent himself, lying dead bottom; he thick scramble over, Tom walk round three-quarters mile more, put his path sadly; and, he got round, he came place called Stop. And he stopped, time. For he edge vast hole bottom sea, rushing roaring clear steam enough work engines world once; clear, indeed, quite light moments; Tom could see almost top water above, pit nobody knows far. But, soon he bent his head edge, he got rap nose pebbles, he jumped back again; steam, rushed up, rasped away sides hole, hurled sea shower mud gravel ashes; spread around, sank again, covered dead fish fast, Tom stood five minutes he buried silt his ankles, began afraid he buried alive. And perhaps he would been, he thinking, whole piece ground he stood torn blown upwards, away flew Tom mile sea, wondering coming next. At last he stopped—thump! found tight legs wonderful bogy he ever seen. It I do not know many wings, big sails windmill, spread ring like them; hovered steam rushed up, ball hovers top fountain. And every wing leg below, claw like comb tip, nostril root; middle stomach one eye; mouth, one side, madreporiform tubercle star-fish is. Well, strange beast; stranger dozens may see. “What want here,” cried quite peevishly, “getting way?” tried drop Tom: he held tight claws, thinking safer he was. So Tom told he was, his errand was. And thing winked one eye, sneered: “I old taken way. You come gold—I know are.” “Gold! What gold?” And really Tom know; suspicious old bogy would believe him. But Tom began understand little. For, vapours came hole, bogy smelt his nostrils, combed sorted his combs; then, steamed his wings, changed showers streams metal. From one wing fell gold-dust, another silver, another copper, another tin, another lead, on, sank soft mud, veins cracks, hardened there. Whereby comes pass rocks full metal. But, sudden, somebody shut steam below, hole left empty instant: rushed water hole, whirlpool bogy spun round round fast teetotum. But his day’s work, like fair fall hounds; he say Tom— “Now time, youngster, get down, earnest, I do not believe.” “You will soon see,” said Tom; away he went, bold Baron Munchausen, shot rushing cataract like salmon Ballisodare. And, he got bottom, he swam till he washed shore safe upon Other-end-of-Nowhere; he found it, his surprise, people do, much like This-End-of-Somewhere he habit expecting. And first he went Waste-paper-land, stupid books lie heaps, hill dale, like leaves winter wood; he saw people digging grubbing among them, make worse books bad ones, thrashing chaff save dust it; good trade drove thereby, especially among children. Then he went sea slops, mountain messes, territory tuck, ground sticky, made bad toffee (not Everton toffee, course), full deep cracks holes choked wind-fallen fruit, green goose-berries, sloes, crabs, whinberries, hips haws, nasty things little children eat, get them. But fairies hide way country fast can, hard work have, little use is. For fast hide away old trash, foolish wicked people make fresh trash full lime poisonous paints, actually go steal receipts old Madame Science’s big book invent poisons little children, sell wakes fairs tuck-shops. Very well. Let go on. Dr. Letheby Dr. Hassall cannot catch them, though setting traps day long. But Fairy birch-rod catch time, make begin one corner shops, eat way other: time got stomach-aches cure poisoning little children. Next he saw little people world, writing little books world, little people world; probably great people write about: names books Squeeky, Pump-lighter, Narrow Narrow World, Hills Chattermuch, Children’s Twaddeday, something else. And, rest little people world read books, thought good President; perhaps right, every one knows his business best. But Tom thought he would sooner jolly good fairy tale, Jack Giant-killer Beauty Beast, taught something he did not know already. And next he came centre Creation (the hub, call there), lies latitude 42.21° south, longitude 108.56° east. And he found wise people instructing mankind science spirit-rapping, house burning heads: Tom told fire, held indignation meeting forthwith, unanimously determined hang Tom’s dog coming country gunpowder his mouth. Tom could not help saying though fancy carried wit away Lincolnshire two hundred years ago, yet one Lincolnshire nobleman among good old Lord Yarborough, he would called fire-engines he hanged people’s dogs. But use, dog hanged: Tom could not even his carcase; abolished have-his-carcase act country, fear lest rogues fell out, honest men come own. And would succeeded perfectly, always do, (as also always do) failed one little particular, viz. dog would die, water-dog, bit fingers abominably forced let go, Tom likewise, British subjects. Whereon recommenced rapping spirits fathers; much astonished poor old spirits came, saw how, according laws Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, descendants weakened constitution hard living. Then came Tom Island Polupragmosyne (which call Rogues’ Harbour; wrong; middle Bramshill Bushes, county police cleared long ago). There every one knows his neighbour’s business better his own; noisy place is, might expected, considering inhabitants _ex officio_ wrong side house “Parliament Man, Federation World;” always making wry mouths, crying fairies’ grapes sour. There Tom saw ploughs drawing horses, nails driving hammers, birds’ nests taking boys, books making authors, bulls keeping china-shops, monkeys shaving cats, dead dogs drilling live lions, blind brigadiers shelfed principals colleges, play-actors least shelfed popular preachers; and, short, every one set something he learnt, he learnt, pretended learn, he failed. There stands Pantheon Great Unsuccessful, builders Tower Babel Trafalgar Fountains; politicians lecture constitutions ought marched, conspirators revolutions ought succeeded, economists schemes ought made every one’s fortune, projectors discoveries ought set Thames fire. There cobblers lecture orthopedy (whatsoever may be) cannot sell shoes; poets Æsthetics (whatsoever may be) cannot sell poetry. There philosophers demonstrate England would freest richest country world, she would turn Papist again; penny-a-liners abuse Times, wit enough get staff; young ladies walk lockets Charles First’s hair (or somebody else’s, Jews’ genuine stock used up), inscribed neat appropriate legend—which indeed popular land, which, I hope, learn translate due time perpend likewise:— “_Victrix causa diis placuit_, _sed victa puellis_.” When he got middle town, set once, show his way; rather, show he know his way; asking way he wanted go, one ever thought that. But one pulled hither, another poked thither, third cried— “You must not go west, I tell you; destruction go west.” “But I going west, may see,” said Tom. And another, “The east lies here, dear; I assure east.” “But I do not want go east,” said Tom. “Well, then, events, whichever way going, going wrong,” cried one voice—which thing ever agreed about; pointed thirty-and-two points compass, till Tom thought sign-posts England got together, fallen fighting. And whether he would ever escaped town, hard say, dog taken his head going pull his master pieces, tackled sharply gastrocnemius muscle, he gave business think last; rubbing bitten calves, Tom dog got safe away. On borders island he found Gotham, wise men live; dragged pond moon fallen it, planted hedge round cuckoo, keep spring year. And he found bricking town gate, wide little folks could get through. And, he asked why, told expanding liturgy. So he went on; business his: he could help saying his country, kitten could get hole cat, she might stay outside mew. But he saw end fellows, he came island Golden Asses, nothing thistles grow. For turned mokes ears yard long, meddling matters understand, Lucius story. And like him, mokes must remain, till, laws development, thistles develop roses. Till then, must comfort thought, longer ears are, thicker hides; good beating do not hurt them. Then came Tom great land Hearsay, less thirty odd kings, beside half dozen Republics, perhaps next mail. And he fell deep, dark, deadly, destructive war, waged princes potentates parts, spiritual temporal, think? One thing I sure of. That unless I told you, would never know; waged war either; strategy art military consisted safe easy process stopping ears screaming, “Oh, do not tell us!” running away. So Tom came land, he found all, high low, man, woman, child, running lives day night continually, entreating told did not know what: land island, dislike water (being musty lot part), ran round round shore ever, (as island exactly circumference planet honour living) hard work, especially business look after. But them, bandmaster fugleman, ran gentleman shearing pig; melodious strains animal led ever, conquest, still flight; kept spirits mightily thought would least pig’s wool pains. And running them, day night, came poor, lean, seedy, hard-worked old giant, ought cockered up, good dinner given him, good wife found him, set play little children; he would presentable old fellow all; he heart, though considerably overgrown brains. He made principally fish bones parchment, put together wire Canada balsam; smelt strongly spirits, though he never drank anything water: spirits he used somehow, denying. He great pair spectacles his nose, butterfly-net one hand, geological hammer other; hung pockets, full collecting boxes, bottles, microscopes, telescopes, barometers, ordnance maps, scalpels, forceps, photographic apparatus, tackle finding everything everything, little too. And, strange all, he running forwards backwards, fast he could. Away good folks ran him, except Tom, stood his ground dodged his legs; giant, he passed him, looked down, cried, he quite pleased comforted,— “What? you? And actually do not run away, like rest?” But he take his spectacles off, Tom remarked, order see plainly. Tom told he was; giant pulled bottle cork instantly, collect with. But Tom sharp that, dodged his legs front him; giant could see all. “No, no, no!” said Tom, “I have round world, world, Mother Carey’s haven, beside caught net called Holothurian Cephalopod, bottled old giant like you.” And giant understood great traveller Tom been, he made truce once, would kept day pick his brains, delighted he finding one tell he know before. “Ah, lucky little dog!” said he last, quite simply—for he simplest, pleasantest, honestest, kindliest old Dominie Sampson giant ever turned world upside without intending it—“ah, lucky little dog! If I been, see seen!” “Well,” said Tom, “if want that, best put head water hours, I did, turn water-baby, baby, might chance.” “Turn baby, eh? If I could that, know happening one hour, I know everything then, rest. But I cannot; I cannot little child again; I suppose I could, would use, I know nothing happening me. Ah, lucky little dog!” said poor old giant. “But run poor people?” said Tom, liked giant much. “My dear, it is running me, father son, hundreds hundreds years, throwing stones till knocked spectacles fifty times, calling malignant turbaned Turk, beat Venetian traduced State—goodness knows mean, I never read poetry—and hunting round round—though catch cannot, every time I go ground, I go faster, grow bigger. While I want friends them, tell something advantage, like Mr. Joseph Ady: somehow strangely afraid hearing it. But, I suppose I man world, tact.” “But do not turn round tell so?” “Because I cannot. You see, I one sons Epimetheus, must go backwards, I go all.” “But do not stop, let come you?” “Why, dear, think. If I did, butterflies cockyolybirds would fly past me, I catch new species, grow rusty mouldy, die. And I do not intend that, dear; I destiny me, say: though I do not know, do not care.” “Do not care?” said Tom. “No. Do duty lies nearest you, catch first beetle come across, motto; I thriven hundred years. Now I must go on. Dear me, I talking you, least nine new species escaped me.” And went giant, behind before, like bull china-shop, till he ran steeple great idol temple (for idolaters parts, course, else would never afraid giants), knocked upper half clean off, hurting horribly small back. But little he cared; soon ruins steeple well his legs, he poked peered among falling stones, shifted his spectacles, pulled his pocket-magnifier, cried— “An entirely new Oniscus, three obscure Podurellæ! Besides moth M. le Roi des Papillons (though he, like Frenchmen, given hasty inductions) says confined limits Glacial Drift. This important!” And he sat nave temple (not man world) examine his Podurellæ. Whereon (as expected) roof caved bodily, smashing idols, sending priests flying doors windows, like rabbits burrow ferret goes in. But he never heeded; dust flew bat, giant moment. “Dear me! This even important! Here cognate species Macgilliwaukie Brown insists confined Buddhist temples Little Thibet; I look it, may variety produced difference climate!” And bagged his bat, he got, he went; people ran, none better humour temple smashed sake three obscure species Podurella, Buddhist bat. “Well,” thought Tom, “this pretty quarrel, good deal said sides. But business mine.” And was, he water-baby, original sow right ear; never have, unless baby, whether water, land, air, matters not, provided keep continually baby. So giant ran round people, people ran round giant, running, unto day aught I know, know; run till either he, they, both, turn little children. And then, Shakespeare says (and therefore must true)— “_Jack shall Gill_ _Nought shall go ill_ _The man shall his mare again_, _and go well_.” Then Tom came famous island, called, days great traveller Captain Gulliver, Isle Laputa. But Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid named Isle Tomtoddies, heads bodies. And Tom came near it, he heard grumbling grunting growling wailing weeping whining he thought people must ringing little pigs, cropping puppies’ ears, drowning kittens: he came nearer still, he began hear words among noise; Tomtoddies’ song sing morning evening, night too, great idol Examination— “_I cannot learn lesson_: _the examiner’s coming_!” And song knew. And Tom got shore first thing he saw great pillar, one side inscribed, “Playthings allowed here;” he shocked he would stay see written side. Then he looked round people island: instead men, women, children, he found nothing turnips radishes, beet mangold wurzel, without single green leaf among them, half burst decayed, toad-stools growing them. Those left began crying Tom, half dozen different languages once, badly spoken, “I cannot learn lesson; come help me!” And one cried, “Can show extract square root?” And another, “Can tell distance α Lyræ β Camelopardis?” And another, “What latitude longitude Snooksville, Noman’s County, Oregon, YOU.S.?” And another, “What name Mutius Scævola’s thirteenth cousin’s grandmother’s maid’s cat?” And another, “How long would take school-inspector average activity tumble head heels London York?” And another, “Can tell name place nobody ever heard of, nothing ever happened, country discovered yet?” And another, “Can show correct hopelessly corrupt passage Graidiocolosyrtus Tabenniticus, crocodiles tongues?” And on, on, on, till one would thought trying tide-waiters’ places, cornetcies heavy dragoons. “And good earth I tell you?” quoth Tom. Well, did not know that: knew examiner coming. Then Tom stumbled hugest softest nimblecomequick turnip ever saw filling hole crop swedes, cried him, “Can tell anything anything like?” “About what?” says Tom. “About anything like; fast I learn things I forget again. So mamma says intellect adapted methodic science, says I must go general information.” Tom told he know general information, officers army; he friend went drummer: he could tell great many strange things he seen his travels. So he told prettily enough, poor turnip listened carefully; he listened, he forgot, water ran him. Tom thought he crying: his poor brains running away, worked hard; Tom talked, unhappy turnip streamed juice, split shrank till nothing left rind water; whereat Tom ran away fright, he thought he might taken killing turnip. But, contrary, turnip’s parents highly delighted, considered saint martyr, put long inscription his tomb his wonderful talents, early development, unparalleled precocity. Were foolish couple? But still foolish couple next them, beating wretched little radish, bigger thumb, sullenness obstinacy wilful stupidity, never knew reason could not learn hardly even speak was, great worm inside eating brains. But even foolisher hundred score papas mammas, fetch rod ought fetch new toy, send dark cupboard instead doctor. Tom puzzled frightened he saw, he longing ask meaning it; last he stumbled respectable old stick lying half covered earth. But stout worthy stick was, belonged good Roger Ascham old time, carved head King Edward Sixth, Bible his hand. “You see,” said stick, “there pretty little children could wish see, might still left grow like human beings, handed me; foolish fathers mothers, instead letting pick flowers, make dirt-pies, get birds’ nests, dance round gooseberry bush, little children should, kept always lessons, working, working, working, learning week-day lessons week-days, Sunday lessons Sunday, weekly examinations every Saturday, monthly examinations every month, yearly examinations every year, everything seven times over, enough, enough good feast—till brains grew big, bodies grew small, changed turnips, little water inside; still foolish parents actually pick leaves fast grow, lest anything green them.” “Ah!” said Tom, “if dear Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby knew she would send lot tops, balls, marbles, ninepins, make jolly sand-boys.” “It would use,” said stick. “They cannot play now, tried. Do not see legs turned roots grown ground, never taking exercise, sapping moping always place? But comes Examiner-of-all-Examiners. So better get away, I warn you, he examine dog bargain, set examine dogs, examine water-babies. There escaping his hands, his nose nine thousand miles long, go chimneys, keyholes, upstairs, downstairs, lady’s chamber, examining little boys, little boys’ tutors likewise. But he thrashed—so Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid promised me—I shall thrashing him: I do not lay it is pity.” Tom went off: rather slowly surlily; he somewhat minded face Examiner-of-all-Examiners, came striding among poor turnips, binding heavy burdens grievous borne, laying little children’s shoulders, like Scribes Pharisees old, touching one his fingers; he plenty money, fine house live in, forth; poor little turnips had. But he got near, he looked big burly dictatorial, shouted loud Tom, come examined, Tom ran his life, dog too. And really time; poor turnips, hurry fright, crammed fast ready Examiner, burst popped dozens round him, till place sounded like Aldershot field-day, Tom thought he blown air, dog all. As he went shore he passed poor turnip’s new tomb. But Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid taken away epitaph talents precocity development, put one her instead Tom thought much sensible:— “_Instruction sore long time I bore_, _And cramming vain_; _Till heaven please woes ease_ _With water brain_.” So Tom jumped sea, swam his way, singing:— “_Farewell_, _Tomtoddies all_; _I thank stars_ _That nought I know save three royal r’s_: _Reading riting sure_, _with rithmetick_, _Will help lad sense thin thick_.” Whereby may see Tom poet: John Bunyan, though he wise man meet month Sundays. And next he came Oldwivesfabledom, folks heathens, worshipped howling ape. And he found little boy sitting middle road, crying bitterly. “What crying for?” said Tom. “Because I frightened I could wish be.” “Not frightened? You queer little chap: but, want frightened, goes—Boo!” “Ah,” said little boy, “that kind you; I do not feel made impression.” Tom offered upset him, punch him, stamp him, fettle head brick, anything else whatsoever would give slightest comfort. But he thanked Tom civilly, fine long words he heard folk use, therefore, he thought fit proper use himself; cried till his papa mamma came, sent Powwow man immediately. And good-natured gentleman lady were, though heathens; talked quite pleasantly Tom his travels, till Powwow man arrived, his thunderbox his arm. And well-fed, ill-favoured gentleman he was, ever served Her Majesty Portland. Tom little frightened first; he thought Grimes. But he soon saw his mistake: Grimes always looked man face; fellow never did. And he spoke, fire smoke; he sneezed, squibs crackers; he cried (which he whenever paid him), boiling pitch; sure stick. “Here again!” cried he, like clown pantomime. “So cannot feel frightened, little dear—eh? I will you. I will make impression you! Yah! Boo! Whirroo! Hullabaloo!” And he rattled, thumped, brandished his thunderbox, yelled, shouted, raved, roared, stamped, danced corrobory like black fellow; he touched spring thunderbox, popped turnip-ghosts magic-lanthorns pasteboard bogies spring-heeled Jacks, sallaballas, horrid din, clatter, clank, roll, rattle, roar, little boy turned whites his eyes, fainted right away. And his poor heathen papa mamma much delighted found gold mine; fell upon knees Powwow man, gave palanquin pole solid silver curtains cloth gold; carried backs: soon taken up, pole stuck shoulders, could set more, carried willynilly, Sinbad carried old man sea: pitiable sight see; father brave officer, wore two swords blue button; mother pretty lady ever pinched feet like Chinese. But see, chosen foolish thing often; so, laws Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, go whether chose not, till coming Cocqcigrues. Ah! do not wish one would go convert poor heathens, teach frighten little children fits? “Now, then,” said Powwow man Tom, “would not like frightened, little dear? For I see plainly wicked, naughty, graceless, reprobate boy.” “You are another,” quoth Tom, sturdily. And man ran him, cried “Boo!” Tom ran return, cried “Boo!” likewise, right his face, set little dog upon him; his legs dog went. At which, believe it, fellow turned tail, thunderbox all, “Woof!” like old sow common; ran his life, screaming, “Help! thieves! murder! fire! He going kill me! I ruined man! He murder me; break, burn, destroy precious invaluable thunderbox; thunder-showers land. Help! help! help!” At papa mamma people Oldwivesfabledom flew Tom, shouting, “Oh, wicked, impudent, hard-hearted, graceless boy! Beat him, kick him, shoot him, drown him, hang him, burn him!” forth: luckily nothing shoot, hang, burn with, fairies hid killing-tackle way little before; could pelt stones; stones went clean him, came side. But he mind bit; holes closed fast made, he water-baby. However, he glad he safe country, noise made deaf. Then he came quiet place, called Leaveheavenalone. And sun drawing water sea make steam-threads, wind twisting make cloud-patterns, till worked loveliest wedding veil Chantilly lace, hung Crystal Palace one buy could afford it; good old sea never grudged, she knew would pay her back honestly. So sun span, wind wove, went well great steam-loom; likely, considering—and considering—and considering— And last, innumerable adventures, wonderful last, he saw huge building, much bigger, and—what surprising—a little uglier certain new lunatic asylum, built quite materials. None it, least—or, indeed, aught I ever saw, part building whatsoever—is cased nine-inch brick inside out, filled rubble walls, order gentleman confined Her Majesty’s pleasure may unconfined his pleasure, take walk neighbouring park improve his spirits, hour’s light wholesome labour his dinner-fork one legs his iron bedstead. No. The walls building built entirely different principle, need described, yet discovered. Tom walked towards great building, wondering was, strange fancy he might find Mr. Grimes inside it, till he saw running toward him, shouting “Stop!” three four people, who, came nearer, nothing else policemen’s truncheons, running along without legs arms. Tom astonished. He long past that. Besides, he seen naviculæ water move nobody knows how, hundred times, without arms, legs, anything stand stead. Neither he frightened he harm. So he stopped; and, foremost truncheon came asked his business, he showed Mother Carey’s pass; truncheon looked oddest fashion; he one eye middle his upper end, he looked anything, quite stiff, he slope himself, poke himself, till wonder he tumble over; but, quite full spirit justice (as policemen, truncheons, ought be), he always position stable equilibrium, whichever way he put himself. “All right—pass on,” said he last. And he added: “I better go you, young man.” And Tom objection, company respectable safe; truncheon coiled thong neatly round handle, prevent tripping up—for thong got loose running—and marched Tom’s side. “Why policeman carry you?” asked Tom, while. “Because like clumsy-made truncheons land-world, cannot go without whole man carry about. We work ourselves; well, though I say not.” “Then thong handle?” asked Tom. “To hang by, course, duty.” Tom got his answer, say, till came great iron door prison. And truncheon knocked twice, head. A wicket door opened, looked tremendous old brass blunderbuss charged muzzle slugs, porter; Tom started back little sight him. “What case this?” he asked deep voice, his broad bell mouth. “If please, sir, case; young gentleman her ladyship, wants see Grimes, master-sweep.” “Grimes?” said blunderbuss. And he pulled his muzzle, perhaps look his prison-lists. “Grimes chimney No. 345,” he said inside. “So young gentleman better go roof.” Tom looked enormous wall, seemed least ninety miles high, wondered he ever get up: but, he hinted truncheon, settled matter moment. For whisked round, gave shove behind sent roof time, his little dog his arm. And he walked along leads, till he met another truncheon, told his errand. “Very good,” said. “Come along: use. He unremorseful, hard-hearted, foul-mouthed fellow I charge; thinks nothing beer pipes, allowed here, course.” So walked along leads, sooty were, Tom thought chimneys must want sweeping much. But he surprised see soot stick his feet, dirty least. Neither live coals, lying plenty, burn him; for, water-baby, his radical humours moist cold nature, may read large Lemnius, Cardan, Van Helmont, gentlemen, knew much could, man know more. And last came chimney No. 345. Out top it, his head shoulders showing, stuck poor Mr. Grimes, sooty, bleared, ugly, Tom could hardly bear look him. And his mouth pipe; a-light; though he pulling his might. “Attention, Mr. Grimes,” said truncheon; “here gentleman come see you.” But Mr. Grimes said bad words; kept grumbling, “My pipe will not draw. My pipe will not draw.” “Keep civil tongue, attend!” said truncheon; popped like Punch, hitting Grimes crack head itself, his brains rattled inside like dried walnut she will. He tried get his hands out, rub place: he could not, stuck fast chimney. Now he forced attend. “Hey!” he said, “why, it is Tom! I suppose come laugh me, spiteful little atomy?” Tom assured he not, wanted help him. “I do not want anything except beer, I cannot get; light bothering pipe, I cannot get either.” “I will get one,” said Tom; he took live coal (there plenty lying about) put Grimes’ pipe: went instantly. “It is use,” said truncheon, leaning chimney looking on. “I tell you, use. His heart cold freezes everything comes near him. You see presently, plain enough.” “Oh, course, it is fault. Everything’s always fault,” said Grimes. “Now do not go hit again” (for truncheon started upright, looked wicked); “you know, arms free, dare not hit then.” The truncheon leant back chimney, took notice personal insult, like well-trained policeman was, though he ready enough avenge transgression morality order. “But cannot I help way? Cannot I help get chimney?” said Tom. “No,” interposed truncheon; “he come place everybody must help themselves; he find out, I hope, he done me.” “Oh, yes,” said Grimes, “of course it is me. Did I ask brought prison? Did I ask set sweep foul chimneys? Did I ask lighted straw put make go up? Did I ask stick fast first chimney all, shamefully clogged soot? Did I ask stay here—I do not know long—a hundred years, I believe, never get pipe, beer, nothing fit beast, let alone man?” “No,” answered solemn voice behind. “No Tom, behaved way.” It Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid. And, truncheon saw her, started bolt upright—Attention!—and made low bow, full spirit justice, must tumbled end, probably hurt one eye. And Tom made his bow too. “Oh, madam,” he said, “do not think me; that is past gone, good times bad times times pass over. But may I help poor Mr. Grimes? May not I try get bricks away, he may move his arms?” “You may try, course,” she said. So Tom pulled tugged bricks: he could move one. And he tried wipe Mr. Grimes’ face: soot would come off. “Oh, dear!” he said. “I come way, terrible places, help you, I use all.” “You best leave alone,” said Grimes; “you good-natured forgiving little chap, that is truth; you would best off. The hail’s coming soon, beat eyes little head.” “What hail?” “Why, hail falls every evening here; and, till comes close me, it is like much warm rain: turns hail head, knocks like small shot.” “That hail never come more,” said strange lady. “I told was. It mother’s tears, she she would she prayed her bedside; cold heart froze hail. But she gone heaven now, weep her graceless son.” Then Grimes silent awhile; he looked sad. “So old mother’s gone, I never speak her! Ah! good woman she was, might happy one, her little school Vendale, had not bad ways.” “Did she keep school Vendale?” asked Tom. And he told Grimes story his going her house, she could abide sight chimney-sweep, kind she was, he turned water-baby. “Ah!” said Grimes, “good reason she hate sight chimney-sweep. I ran away her took sweeps, never let her know I was, sent her penny help her, it is late—too late!” said Mr. Grimes. And he began crying blubbering like great baby, till his pipe dropped his mouth, broke bits. “Oh, dear, I little chap Vendale again, see clear beck, apple-orchard, yew-hedge, different I would go on! But it is late now. So go along, kind little chap, do not stand look man crying, that is old enough father, never feared face man, worse neither. But I am beat now, beat I must be. I have made bed, I must lie it. Foul I would be, foul I am, Irishwoman said once; little I heeded it. It is fault: it is late.” And he cried bitterly Tom began crying too. “Never late,” said fairy, strange soft new voice Tom looked her; she beautiful moment, Tom half fancied she her sister. No late. For, poor Grimes cried blubbered on, his tears his mother’s could do, Tom’s could do, nobody’s earth could him; washed soot his face his clothes; washed mortar away bricks; chimney crumbled down; Grimes began get it. Up jumped truncheon, going hit crown tremendous thump, drive like cork bottle. But strange lady put aside. “Will obey I give chance?” “As please, madam. You are stronger me—that I know well, wiser me, I know well also. And, master, I have fared ill enough yet. So whatever ladyship pleases order me; I am beat, that is truth.” “Be then—you may come out. But remember, disobey again, worse place still go.” “I beg pardon madam, I never disobeyed I know of. I never honour setting eyes upon till I came ugly quarters.” “Never saw me? Who said you, Those foul, foul be?” Grimes looked up; Tom looked too; voice Irishwoman met day went together Harthover. “I gave warning then: gave thousand times since. Every bad word said—every cruel mean thing did—every time got tipsy—every day went dirty—you disobeying me, whether knew not.” “If I would known, madam—” “You knew well enough disobeying something, though know me. But come take chance. Perhaps may last.” So Grimes stepped chimney, really, scars his face, he looked clean respectable master-sweep need look. “Take away,” said she truncheon, “and give his ticket-of-leave.” “And he do, madam?” “Get sweep crater Etna; he find steady men working time there, teach his business: mind, crater gets choked again, earthquake consequence, bring me, I shall investigate case severely.” So truncheon marched Mr. Grimes, looking meek drowned worm. And aught I know, know, he sweeping crater Etna day. “And now,” said fairy Tom, “your work done. You may well go back again.” “I glad enough go,” said Tom, “but I get great hole again, steam stopped blowing?” “I take backstairs: I must bandage eyes first; I never allow anybody see backstairs mine.” “I sure I shall tell anybody them, madam, bid not.” “Aha! So think, little man. But would soon forget promise got back land-world. For, people found backstairs, would fine ladies kneeling you, rich men emptying purses you, statesmen offering place power; young old, rich poor, crying you, ‘Only tell us great backstairs secret, slaves; make lord, king, emperor, bishop, archbishop, pope, like—only tell us secret backstairs. For thousands years paying, petting, obeying, worshipping quacks told us key backstairs, could smuggle us them; spite disappointments, honour, glorify, adore, beatify, translate, apotheotise likewise, chance knowing something backstairs, may go pilgrimage it; and, even cannot get it, lie foot it, cry— ‘_Oh_, _backstairs_, _precious backstairs_, _invaluable backstairs_, _requisite backstairs_, _necessary backstairs_, _good-natured backstairs_, _cosmopolitan backstairs_, _comprehensive backstairs_, _accommodating backstairs_, _well-bred backstairs_, _commercial backstairs_, _economical backstairs_, _practical backstairs_, _logical backstairs_, _deductive backstairs_, _comfortable backstairs_, _humane backstairs_, _reasonable backstairs_, _long-sought backstairs_, _coveted backstairs_, _aristocratic backstairs_, _respectable backstairs_, _gentlenmanlike backstairs_, _ladylike backstairs_, _orthodox backstairs_, _probable backstairs_, _credible backstairs_, _demonstrable backstairs_, _irrefragable backstairs_, _potent backstairs_, _all-but-omnipotent backstairs_, &c. Save us consequences actions, cruel fairy, Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid!’ Do think would little tempted tell know, laddie?” Tom thought certainly. “But want know backstairs?” asked he, little frightened long words, understanding least; as, indeed, he meant do, either. “That I shall tell you. I never put things little folks’ heads likely come themselves. So come—now I must bandage eyes.” So she tied bandage his eyes one hand, she took off. “Now,” she said, “you safe stairs.” Tom opened his eyes wide, his mouth too; he not, he thought, moved single step. But, he looked round him, could doubt he safe backstairs, whatsoever may be, man going tell you, plain reason man knows. The first thing Tom saw black cedars, high sharp rosy dawn; St. Brandan’s Isle reflected double still broad silver sea. The wind sang softly cedars, water sang among eaves: sea-birds sang streamed ocean, land-birds built among boughs; air full song stirred St. Brandan his hermits, slumbered shade; moved good old lips, sang morning hymn amid dreams. But among songs one came across water sweet clear all; song young girl’s voice. And song she sang? Ah, little man, I old sing song, young understand it. But patience, keep eye single, hands clean, learn day sing yourself, without needing man teach you. And Tom neared island, sat upon rock graceful creature ever seen, looking down, her chin upon her hand, paddling her feet water. And came her she looked up, behold Ellie. “Oh, Miss Ellie,” said he, “how grown!” “Oh, Tom,” said she, “how grown too!” And wonder; quite grown up—he tall man, she beautiful woman. “Perhaps I may grown,” she said. “I time enough; I sitting waiting many hundred years, till I thought never coming.” “Many hundred years?” thought Tom; he seen much his travels he quite given astonished; and, indeed, he could think nothing Ellie. So he stood looked Ellie, Ellie looked him; liked employment much stood looked seven years more, neither spoke stirred. At last heard fairy say: “Attention, children. Are never going look again?” “We looking while,” said. And thought been. “Then look more,” said she. They looked—and cried once, “Oh, you, all?” “You dear Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby.” “No, good Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid; grown quite beautiful now!” “To you,” said fairy. “But look again.” “You Mother Carey,” said Tom, low, solemn voice; he found something made happy, yet frightened he ever seen. “But grown quite young again.” “To you,” said fairy. “Look again.” “You Irishwoman met day I went Harthover!” And looked she neither them, yet once. “My name written eyes, eyes see there.” And looked her great, deep, soft eyes, changed every hue, light changes diamond. “Now read name,” said she, last. And her eyes flashed, one moment, clear, white, blazing light: children could read her name; dazzled, hid faces hands. “Not yet, young things, yet,” said she, smiling; she turned Ellie. “You may take home Sundays, Ellie. He his spurs great battle, become fit go man; he done thing he like.” So Tom went home Ellie Sundays, sometimes week-days, too; he great man science, plan railroads, steam-engines, electric telegraphs, rifled guns, forth; knows everything everything, except hen’s egg do not turn crocodile, two three little things one know till coming Cocqcigrues. And he learnt he water-baby, underneath sea. “And course Tom married Ellie?” My dear child, silly notion! Do not know one ever marries fairy tale, rank prince princess? “And Tom’s dog?” Oh, may see clear night July; old dog-star worn last three hot summers dog-days since; take put Tom’s dog his place. Therefore, new brooms sweep clean, may hope warm weather year. And end story.
