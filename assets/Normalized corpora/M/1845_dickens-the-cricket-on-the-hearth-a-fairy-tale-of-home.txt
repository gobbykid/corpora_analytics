 THE CRICKET ON THE HEARTH CHAPTER I—Chirp First The kettle began it! Do not tell Mrs. Peerybingle said. I know better. Mrs. Peerybingle may leave record end time she could not say began it; but, I say kettle did. I ought know, I hope! The kettle began it, full five minutes little waxy-faced Dutch clock corner, Cricket uttered chirp. As clock had not finished striking, convulsive little Haymaker top it, jerking away right left scythe front Moorish Palace, had not mowed half acre imaginary grass Cricket joined all! Why, I naturally positive. Every one knows that. I would not set opinion opinion Mrs. Peerybingle, unless I quite sure, account whatever. Nothing induce me. But, question fact. And fact is, kettle began it, least five minutes Cricket gave sign existence. Contradict me, I will say ten. Let narrate exactly happened. I proceeded first word, plain consideration—if I tell story I must begin beginning; possible begin beginning, without beginning kettle? It appeared sort match, trial skill, must understand, kettle Cricket. And led it, came about. Mrs. Peerybingle, going raw twilight, clicking wet stones pair pattens worked innumerable rough impressions first proposition Euclid yard—Mrs. Peerybingle filled kettle water-butt. Presently returning, less pattens (and good deal less, tall Mrs. Peerybingle short), she set kettle fire. In she lost her temper, mislaid instant; for, water uncomfortably cold, slippy, slushy, sleety sort state wherein seems penetrate every kind substance, patten rings included—had laid hold Mrs. Peerybingle’s toes, even splashed her legs. And rather plume (with reason too) upon legs, keep particularly neat point stockings, find this, moment, hard bear. Besides, kettle aggravating obstinate. It would not allow adjusted top bar; would not hear accommodating kindly knobs coal; _would_ lean forward drunken air, dribble, Idiot kettle, hearth. It quarrelsome, hissed spluttered morosely fire. To sum all, lid, resisting Mrs. Peerybingle’s fingers, first turned topsy-turvy, then, ingenious pertinacity deserving better because, dived sideways in—down bottom kettle. And hull Royal George never made half monstrous resistance coming water, lid kettle employed Mrs. Peerybingle, she got again. It looked sullen pig-headed enough, even then; carrying handle air defiance, cocking spout pertly mockingly Mrs. Peerybingle, said, ‘I will not boil. Nothing shall induce me!’ But Mrs. Peerybingle, restored good humour, dusted her chubby little hands other, sat kettle, laughing. Meantime, jolly blaze uprose fell, flashing gleaming little Haymaker top Dutch clock, one might thought he stood stock still Moorish Palace, nothing motion flame. He move, however; his spasms, two second, right regular. But, his sufferings clock going strike, frightful behold; and, Cuckoo looked trap-door Palace, gave note six times, shook him, time, like spectral voice—or like something wiry, plucking his legs. It violent commotion whirring noise among weights ropes quite subsided, terrified Haymaker became again. Nor he startled without reason; rattling, bony skeletons clocks disconcerting operation, I wonder much set men, Dutchmen, liking invent them. There popular belief Dutchmen love broad cases much clothing lower selves; might know better leave clocks lank unprotected, surely. Now was, observe, kettle began spend evening. Now was, kettle, growing mellow musical, began irrepressible gurglings throat, indulge short vocal snorts, checked bud, had not quite made mind yet, good company. Now was, two three vain attempts stifle convivial sentiments, threw moroseness, reserve, burst stream song cosy hilarious, never maudlin nightingale yet formed least idea of. So plain too! Bless you, might understood like book—better books I could name, perhaps. With warm breath gushing forth light cloud merrily gracefully ascended feet, hung chimney-corner domestic Heaven, trolled song strong energy cheerfulness, iron body hummed stirred upon fire; lid itself, recently rebellious lid—such influence bright example—performed sort jig, clattered like deaf dumb young cymbal never known use twin brother. That song kettle’s song invitation welcome somebody doors: somebody moment coming on, towards snug small home crisp fire: doubt whatever. Mrs. Peerybingle knew it, perfectly, she sat musing hearth. It is dark night, sang kettle, rotten leaves lying way; and, above, mist darkness, and, below, mire clay; there is one relief sad murky air; I do not know one, it is nothing glare; deep angry crimson, sun wind together; set brand upon clouds guilty weather; widest open country long dull streak black; there is hoar-frost finger-post, thaw upon track; ice is not water, water is not free; could not say anything ought be; he is coming, coming, coming!— And here, like, Cricket DID chime in! Chirrup, Chirrup, Chirrup magnitude, way chorus; voice astoundingly disproportionate size, compared kettle; (size! could not see it!) burst like overcharged gun, fallen victim spot, chirruped little body fifty pieces, would seemed natural inevitable consequence, expressly laboured. The kettle last solo performance. It persevered undiminished ardour; Cricket took first fiddle kept it. Good Heaven, chirped! Its shrill, sharp, piercing voice resounded house, seemed twinkle outer darkness like star. There indescribable little trill tremble it, loudest, suggested carried legs, made leap again, intense enthusiasm. Yet went well together, Cricket kettle. The burden song still same; louder, louder, louder still, sang emulation. The fair little listener—for fair she was, young: though something called dumpling shape; I do not object that—lighted candle, glanced Haymaker top clock, getting pretty average crop minutes; looked window, she saw nothing, owing darkness, her face imaged glass. And opinion (and would been), she might looked long way, seen nothing half agreeable. When she came back, sat her former seat, Cricket kettle still keeping up, perfect fury competition. The kettle’s weak side clearly being, he did not know he beat. There excitement race it. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket mile ahead. Hum, hum, hum—m—m! Kettle making play distance, like great top. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket round corner. Hum, hum, hum—m—m! Kettle sticking his way; idea giving in. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket fresher ever. Hum, hum, hum—m—m! Kettle slow steady. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket going finish him. Hum, hum, hum—m—m! Kettle finished. Until last got jumbled together, hurry-skurry, helter-skelter, match, whether kettle chirped Cricket hummed, Cricket chirped kettle hummed, chirped hummed, would taken clearer head mine decided anything like certainty. But, this, doubt: that, kettle Cricket, one moment, power amalgamation best known themselves, sent, each, his fireside song comfort streaming ray candle shone window, long way lane. And light, bursting certain person who, instant, approached towards gloom, expressed whole thing him, literally twinkling, cried, ‘Welcome home, old fellow! Welcome home, boy!’ This end attained, kettle, dead beat, boiled over, taken fire. Mrs. Peerybingle went running door, where, wheels cart, tramp horse, voice man, tearing excited dog, surprising mysterious appearance baby, soon What is-his-name pay. Where baby came from, Mrs. Peerybingle got hold flash time, _I_ do not know. But live baby was, Mrs. Peerybingle’s arms; pretty tolerable amount pride she seemed it, she drawn gently fire, sturdy figure man, much taller much older herself, stoop long way down, kiss her. But she worth trouble. Six foot six, lumbago, might done it. ‘Oh goodness, John!’ said Mrs. P. ‘What state weather!’ He something worse it, undeniably. The thick mist hung clots upon his eyelashes like candied thaw; fog fire together, rainbows his whiskers. ‘Why, see, Dot,’ John made answer, slowly, he unrolled shawl his throat; warmed his hands; ‘it—it an’t exactly summer weather. So, wonder.’ ‘I wish would not call Dot, John. I do not like it,’ said Mrs. Peerybingle: pouting way clearly showed she _did_ like it, much. ‘Why else you?’ returned John, looking upon her smile, giving her waist light squeeze his huge hand arm could give. ‘A dot and’—here he glanced baby—‘a dot carry—I will not say it, fear I spoil it; I near joke. I do not know ever I nearer.’ He often near something clever, his account: lumbering, slow, honest John; John heavy, light spirit; rough upon surface, gentle core; dull without, quick within; stolid, good! Oh Mother Nature, give thy children true poetry heart hid poor Carrier’s breast—he Carrier way—and bear talking prose, leading lives prose; bear bless thee company! It pleasant see Dot, her little figure, her baby her arms: doll baby: glancing coquettish thoughtfulness fire, inclining her delicate little head enough one side let rest odd, half-natural, half-affected, wholly nestling agreeable manner, great rugged figure Carrier. It pleasant see him, his tender awkwardness, endeavouring adapt his rude support her slight need, make his burly middle-age leaning-staff inappropriate her blooming youth. It pleasant observe Tilly Slowboy, waiting background baby, took special cognizance (though her earliest teens) grouping; stood her mouth eyes wide open, her head thrust forward, taking air. Nor less agreeable observe John Carrier, reference made Dot aforesaid baby, checked his hand point touching infant, he thought he might crack it; bending down, surveyed safe distance, kind puzzled pride, amiable mastiff might supposed show, he found himself, one day, father young canary. ‘An’t he beautiful, John? Do not he look precious his sleep?’ ‘Very precious,’ said John. ‘Very much so. He generally _is_ asleep, an’t he?’ ‘Lor, John! Good gracious no!’ ‘Oh,’ said John, pondering. ‘I thought his eyes generally shut. Halloa!’ ‘Goodness, John, startle one!’ ‘It an’t right turn  them way!’ said astonished Carrier, ‘is it? See he is winking  them once! And look his mouth! Why he is gasping like gold silver fish!’ ‘You do not deserve father, do not,’ said Dot, dignity experienced matron. ‘But know little complaints children troubled with, John! You would not much know names, stupid fellow.’ And she turned baby her left arm, slapped back restorative, she pinched her husband’s ear, laughing. ‘No,’ said John, pulling his outer coat. ‘It is true, Dot. I do not know much it. I know I have fighting pretty stiffly wind to-night. It is blowing north-east, straight cart, whole way home.’ ‘Poor old man, has!’ cried Mrs. Peerybingle, instantly becoming active. ‘Here! Take precious darling, Tilly, I make use. Bless it, I could smother kissing it, I could! Hie then, good dog! Hie, Boxer, boy! Only let make tea first, John; I will help parcels, like busy bee. “How doth little”—and rest it, know, John. Did ever learn “how doth little,” went school, John?’ ‘Not quite know it,’ John returned. ‘I near once. But I spoilt it, I dare say.’ ‘Ha ha,’ laughed Dot. She blithest little laugh ever heard. ‘What dear old darling dunce are, John, sure!’ Not disputing position, John went see boy lantern, dancing fro door window, like Will Wisp, took due care horse; fatter would quite believe, I gave his measure, old his birthday lost mists antiquity. Boxer, feeling his attentions due family general, must impartially distributed, dashed bewildering inconstancy; now, describing circle short barks round horse, he rubbed stable-door; feigning make savage rushes his mistress, facetiously bringing sudden stops; now, eliciting shriek Tilly Slowboy, low nursing-chair near fire, unexpected application his moist nose her countenance; now, exhibiting obtrusive interest baby; now, going round round upon hearth, lying he established night; now, getting again, taking nothing fag-end tail his, weather, he remembered appointment, off, round trot, keep it. ‘There! There is teapot, ready hob!’ said Dot; briskly busy child play keeping house. ‘And there is old knuckle ham; there is butter; there is crusty loaf, all! Here is clothes-basket small parcels, John, you have got there—where you, John?’ ‘Do not let dear child fall grate, Tilly, whatever do!’ It may noted Miss Slowboy, spite her rejecting caution vivacity, she rare surprising talent getting baby difficulties several times imperilled short life, quiet way peculiarly her own. She spare straight shape, young lady, insomuch her garments appeared constant danger sliding sharp pegs, her shoulders, loosely hung. Her costume remarkable partial development, possible occasions, flannel vestment singular structure; also affording glimpses, region back, corset, pair stays, colour dead-green. Being always state gaping admiration everything, absorbed, besides, perpetual contemplation her mistress’s perfections baby’s, Miss Slowboy, her little errors judgment, may said done equal honour her head her heart; though less honour baby’s head, occasional means bringing contact deal doors, dressers, stair-rails, bed-posts, foreign substances, still honest results Tilly Slowboy’s constant astonishment finding herself kindly treated, installed comfortable home. For, maternal paternal Slowboy alike unknown Fame, Tilly bred public charity, foundling; word, though differing fondling one vowel’s length, different meaning, expresses quite another thing. To seen little Mrs. Peerybingle come back her husband, tugging clothes-basket, making strenuous exertions nothing (for he carried it), would amused almost much amused him. It may entertained Cricket too, anything I know; but, certainly, began chirp again, vehemently. ‘Heyday!’ said John, his slow way. ‘It is merrier ever, to-night, I think.’ ‘And it is sure bring us good fortune, John! It always done so. To Cricket Hearth, luckiest thing world!’ John looked her he nearly got thought his head, she his Cricket chief, he quite agreed her. But, probably one his narrow escapes, he said nothing. ‘The first time I heard cheerful little note, John, night brought home—when brought new home here; little mistress. Nearly year ago. You recollect, John?’ O yes. John remembered. I think so! ‘Its chirp welcome me! It seemed full promise encouragement. It seemed say, would kind gentle me, would expect (I fear that, John, then) find old head shoulders foolish little wife.’ John thoughtfully patted one shoulders, head, though he would said No, no; he expectation; he quite content take were. And really he reason. They comely. ‘It spoke truth, John, seemed say so; ever been, I sure, best, considerate, affectionate husbands me. This happy home, John; I love Cricket sake!’ ‘Why I then,’ said Carrier. ‘So I, Dot.’ ‘I love many times I heard it, many thoughts harmless music given me. Sometimes, twilight, I felt little solitary down-hearted, John—before baby keep company make house gay—when I thought lonely would I die; lonely I I could know lost me, dear; Chirp, Chirp, Chirp upon hearth, seemed tell another little voice, sweet, dear me, whose coming sound trouble vanished like dream. And I used fear—I fear once, John, I young know—that might prove ill-assorted marriage, I child, like guardian husband; might not, however hard tried, able learn love me, hoped prayed might; Chirp, Chirp, Chirp cheered again, filled new trust confidence. I thinking things to-night, dear, I sat expecting you; I love Cricket sake!’ ‘And I,’ repeated John. ‘But, Dot? _I_ hope pray I might learn love you? How talk! I learnt that, long I brought here, Cricket’s little mistress, Dot!’ She laid her hand, instant, his arm, looked agitated face, she would told something. Next moment she upon her knees basket, speaking sprightly voice, busy parcels. ‘There many to-night, John, I saw goods behind cart, now; though give trouble, perhaps, still pay well; reason grumble, we? Besides, delivering, I dare say, came along?’ ‘Oh yes,’ John said. ‘A good many.’ ‘Why what is round box? Heart alive, John, it is wedding-cake!’ ‘Leave woman alone find that,’ said John, admiringly. ‘Now man would never thought it. Whereas, it is belief pack wedding-cake tea-chest, turn-up bedstead, pickled salmon keg, unlikely thing, woman would sure find directly. Yes; I called pastry-cook’s.’ ‘And weighs I do not know what—whole hundredweights!’ cried Dot, making great demonstration trying lift it. ‘Whose it, John? Where going?’ ‘Read writing side,’ said John. ‘Why, John! My Goodness, John!’ ‘Ah! who would thought it!’ John returned. ‘You never mean say,’ pursued Dot, sitting floor shaking her head him, ‘that it is Gruff Tackleton toymaker!’ John nodded. Mrs. Peerybingle nodded also, fifty times least. Not assent—in dumb pitying amazement; screwing her lips little force (they never made screwing up; I clear that), looking good Carrier through, her abstraction. Miss Slowboy, mean time, mechanical power reproducing scraps current conversation delectation baby, sense struck them, nouns changed plural number, inquired aloud young creature, Was Gruffs Tackletons toymakers then, Would call Pastry-cooks wedding-cakes, Did mothers know boxes fathers brought homes; on. ‘And really come about!’ said Dot. ‘Why, she I girls school together, John.’ He might thinking her, nearly thinking her, perhaps, she school time. He looked upon her thoughtful pleasure, he made answer. ‘And he is old! As unlike her!—Why, many years older you, Gruff Tackleton, John?’ ‘How many cups tea shall I drink to-night one sitting, Gruff Tackleton ever took four, I wonder!’ replied John, good-humouredly, he drew chair round table, began cold ham. ‘As eating, I eat little; little I enjoy, Dot.’ Even this, his usual sentiment meal times, one his innocent delusions (for his appetite always obstinate, flatly contradicted him), awoke smile face his little wife, stood among parcels, pushing cake-box slowly her her foot, never looked, though her eyes cast too, upon dainty shoe she generally mindful of. Absorbed thought, she stood there, heedless alike tea John (although he called her, rapped table his knife startle her), he rose touched her arm; she looked moment, hurried her place behind teaboard, laughing her negligence. But, she laughed before. The manner music quite changed. The Cricket, too, stopped. Somehow room cheerful been. Nothing like it. ‘So, parcels, they, John?’ she said, breaking long silence, honest Carrier devoted practical illustration one part his favourite sentiment—certainly enjoying he ate, could not admitted he ate little. ‘So, parcels; they, John?’ ‘That is all,’ said John. ‘Why—no—I—’ laying his knife fork, taking long breath. ‘I declare—I have clean forgotten old gentleman!’ ‘The old gentleman?’ ‘In cart,’ said John. ‘He asleep, among straw, last time I saw him. I have nearly remembered him, twice, since I came in; he went head again. Halloa! Yahip there! Rouse up! That is hearty!’ John said latter words outside door, whither he hurried candle his hand. Miss Slowboy, conscious mysterious reference The Old Gentleman, connecting her mystified imagination certain associations religious nature phrase, disturbed, hastily rising low chair fire seek protection near skirts her mistress, coming contact she crossed doorway ancient Stranger, she instinctively made charge butt offensive instrument within her reach. This instrument happening baby, great commotion alarm ensued, sagacity Boxer rather tended increase; for, good dog, thoughtful master, had, seemed, watching old gentleman his sleep, lest he walk young poplar trees tied behind cart; he still attended closely, worrying his gaiters fact, making dead sets buttons. ‘You are undeniable good sleeper, sir,’ said John, tranquillity restored; mean time old gentleman stood, bareheaded motionless, centre room; ‘that I half mind ask six are—only would joke, I know I spoil it. Very near though,’ murmured Carrier, chuckle; ‘very near!’ The Stranger, long white hair, good features, singularly bold well defined old man, dark, bright, penetrating eyes, looked round smile, saluted Carrier’s wife gravely inclining his head. His garb quaint odd—a long, long way behind time. Its hue brown, over. In his hand he held great brown club walking-stick; striking upon floor, fell asunder, became chair. On he sat down, quite composedly. ‘There!’ said Carrier, turning his wife. ‘That is way I found him, sitting roadside! Upright milestone. And almost deaf.’ ‘Sitting open air, John!’ ‘In open air,’ replied Carrier, ‘just dusk. “Carriage Paid,” he said; gave eighteenpence. Then he got in. And he is.’ ‘He is going, John, I think!’ Not all. He going speak. ‘If please, I left till called for,’ said Stranger, mildly. ‘Do not mind me.’ With that, he took pair spectacles one his large pockets, book another, leisurely began read. Making Boxer he house lamb! The Carrier his wife exchanged look perplexity. The Stranger raised his head; glancing latter former, said, ‘Your daughter, good friend?’ ‘Wife,’ returned John. ‘Niece?’ said Stranger. ‘Wife,’ roared John. ‘Indeed?’ observed Stranger. ‘Surely? Very young!’ He quietly turned over, resumed his reading. But, he could read two lines, he interrupted say: ‘Baby, yours?’ John gave gigantic nod; equivalent answer affirmative, delivered speaking trumpet. ‘Girl?’ ‘Bo-o-oy!’ roared John. ‘Also young, eh?’ Mrs. Peerybingle instantly struck in. ‘Two months three da-ays! Vaccinated six weeks ago-o! Took fine-ly! Considered, doctor, remarkably beautiful chi-ild! Equal general run children five months o-old! Takes notice, way quite won-der-ful! May seem impossible you, feels his legs al-ready!’ Here breathless little mother, shrieking short sentences old man’s ear, her pretty face crimsoned, held Baby stubborn triumphant fact; Tilly Slowboy, melodious cry ‘Ketcher, Ketcher’—which sounded like unknown words, adapted popular Sneeze—performed cow-like gambols round unconscious Innocent. ‘Hark! He is called for, sure enough,’ said John. ‘There is somebody door. Open it, Tilly.’ Before she could reach it, however, opened without; primitive sort door, latch, one could lift he chose—and good many people choose, kinds neighbours liked cheerful word two Carrier, though he great talker himself. Being opened, gave admission little, meagre, thoughtful, dingy-faced man, seemed made great-coat sack-cloth covering old box; for, he turned shut door, keep weather out, he disclosed upon back garment, inscription G & T large black capitals. Also word GLASS bold characters. ‘Good evening, John!’ said little man. ‘Good evening, Mum. Good evening, Tilly. Good evening, Unbeknown! How is Baby, Mum? Boxer’s pretty well I hope?’ ‘All thriving, Caleb,’ replied Dot. ‘I sure need look dear child, one, know that.’ ‘And I am sure I need look another,’ said Caleb. He did not look her though; he wandering thoughtful eye seemed always projecting time place, matter he said; description equally apply his voice. ‘Or John another,’ said Caleb. ‘Or Tilly, far goes. Or certainly Boxer.’ ‘Busy now, Caleb?’ asked Carrier. ‘Why, pretty well, John,’ he returned, distraught air man casting Philosopher’s stone, least. ‘Pretty much so. There is rather run Noah’s Arks present. I could wished improve upon Family, I do not see it is done price. It would satisfaction one’s mind, make clearer Shems Hams, Wives. Flies an’t scale neither, compared elephants know! Ah! well! Have got anything parcel line me, John?’ The Carrier put his hand pocket coat he taken off; brought out, carefully preserved moss paper, tiny flower-pot. ‘There is!’ he said, adjusting great care. ‘Not much leaf damaged. Full buds!’ Caleb’s dull eye brightened, he took it, thanked him. ‘Dear, Caleb,’ said Carrier. ‘Very dear season.’ ‘Never mind that. It would cheap me, whatever cost,’ returned little man. ‘Anything else, John?’ ‘A small box,’ replied Carrier. ‘Here are!’ ‘“For Caleb Plummer,”’ said little man, spelling direction. ‘“With Cash.” With Cash, John? I do not think it is me.’ ‘With Care,’ returned Carrier, looking his shoulder. ‘Where make cash?’ ‘Oh! To sure!’ said Caleb. ‘It is right. With care! Yes, yes; that is mine. It might cash, indeed, dear Boy Golden South Americas lived, John. You loved like son; did not you? You need not say did. _I_ know, course. “Caleb Plummer. With care.” Yes, yes, it is right. It is box dolls’ eyes daughter’s work. I wish her sight box, John.’ ‘I wish was, could be!’ cried Carrier. ‘Thank’ee,’ said little man. ‘You speak hearty. To think she never see Dolls—and a-staring her, bold, day long! That is cuts. What is damage, John?’ ‘I will damage you,’ said John, ‘if inquire. Dot! Very near?’ ‘Well! it is like say so,’ observed little man. ‘It is kind way. Let see. I think that is all.’ ‘I think not,’ said Carrier. ‘Try again.’ ‘Something Governor, eh?’ said Caleb, pondering little while. ‘To sure. That is I came for; head’s running Arks things! He has not here, he?’ ‘Not he,’ returned Carrier. ‘He is busy, courting.’ ‘He is coming round though,’ said Caleb; ‘for he told keep near side road going home, ten one he would take up. I better go, bye.—You could not goodness let pinch Boxer’s tail, Mum, half moment, could you?’ ‘Why, Caleb! question!’ ‘Oh never mind, Mum,’ said little man. ‘He might not like perhaps. There is small order come in, barking dogs; I wish go close Natur’ I could, sixpence. That is all. Never mind, Mum.’ It happened opportunely, Boxer, without receiving proposed stimulus, began bark great zeal. But, implied approach new visitor, Caleb, postponing his study life convenient season, shouldered round box, took hurried leave. He might spared trouble, he met visitor upon threshold. ‘Oh! You here, you? Wait bit. I will take home. John Peerybingle, service you. More service pretty wife. Handsomer every day! Better too, possible! And younger,’ mused speaker, low voice; ‘that is Devil it!’ ‘I astonished paying compliments, Mr. Tackleton,’ said Dot, best grace world; ‘but condition.’ ‘You know then?’ ‘I got believe it, somehow,’ said Dot. ‘After hard struggle, I suppose?’ ‘Very.’ Tackleton Toy-merchant, pretty generally known Gruff Tackleton—for firm, though Gruff bought long ago; leaving his name, said his nature, according Dictionary meaning, business—Tackleton Toy-merchant, man whose vocation quite misunderstood his Parents Guardians. If made Money Lender, sharp Attorney, Sheriff’s Officer, Broker, he might sown his discontented oats his youth, and, full run ill-natured transactions, might turned amiable, last, sake little freshness novelty. But, cramped chafing peaceable pursuit toy-making, he domestic Ogre, living children his life, implacable enemy. He despised toys; would not bought one world; delighted, his malice, insinuate grim expressions faces brown-paper farmers drove pigs market, bellmen advertised lost lawyers’ consciences, movable old ladies darned stockings carved pies; like samples his stock trade. In appalling masks; hideous, hairy, red-eyed Jacks Boxes; Vampire Kites; demoniacal Tumblers would not lie down, perpetually flying forward, stare infants countenance; his soul perfectly revelled. They his relief, safety-valve. He great inventions. Anything suggestive Pony-nightmare delicious him. He even lost money (and he took toy kindly) getting Goblin slides magic-lanterns, whereon Powers Darkness depicted sort supernatural she will-fish, human faces. In intensifying portraiture Giants, he sunk quite little capital; and, though painter himself, he could indicate, instruction his artists, piece chalk, certain furtive leer countenances monsters, safe destroy peace mind young gentleman ages six eleven, whole Christmas Midsummer Vacation. What he toys, he (as men are) things. You may easily suppose, therefore, within great green cape, reached calves his legs, buttoned chin uncommonly pleasant fellow; he choice spirit, agreeable companion, ever stood pair bull-headed-looking boots mahogany-coloured tops. Still, Tackleton, toy-merchant, going married. In spite this, he going married. And young wife too, beautiful young wife. He did not look much like bridegroom, he stood Carrier’s kitchen, twist his dry face, screw his body, his hat jerked bridge his nose, his hands tucked bottoms his pockets, his whole sarcastic ill-conditioned self peering one little corner one little eye, like concentrated essence number ravens. But, Bridegroom he designed be. ‘In three days’ time. Next Thursday. The last day first month year. That is wedding-day,’ said Tackleton. Did I mention he always one eye wide open, one eye nearly shut; one eye nearly shut, always expressive eye? I do not think I did. ‘That is wedding-day!’ said Tackleton, rattling his money. ‘Why, it is wedding-day too,’ exclaimed Carrier. ‘Ha ha!’ laughed Tackleton. ‘Odd! You are another couple. Just!’ The indignation Dot presumptuous assertion described. What next? His imagination would compass possibility another Baby, perhaps. The man mad. ‘I say! A word you,’ murmured Tackleton, nudging Carrier his elbow, taking little apart. ‘You will come wedding? We are boat, know.’ ‘How boat?’ inquired Carrier. ‘A little disparity, know,’ said Tackleton, another nudge. ‘Come spend evening us, beforehand.’ ‘Why?’ demanded John, astonished pressing hospitality. ‘Why?’ returned other. ‘That is new way receiving invitation. Why, pleasure—sociability, know, that!’ ‘I thought never sociable,’ said John, his plain way. ‘Tchah! It is use anything free you, I see,’ said Tackleton. ‘Why, then, truth a—what tea-drinking people call sort comfortable appearance together, wife. We know better, know, but—’ ‘No, do not know better,’ interposed John. ‘What talking about?’ ‘Well! We _don’t_ know better, then,’ said Tackleton. ‘We will agree do not. As like; matter? I going say, sort appearance, company produce favourable effect Mrs. Tackleton be. And, though I do not think good lady’s friendly me, matter, still she cannot help herself falling views, there is compactness cosiness appearance her always tells, even indifferent case. You will say you will come?’ ‘We arranged keep Wedding-Day (as far goes) home,’ said John. ‘We made promise six months. We think, see, home—’ ‘Bah! what is home?’ cried Tackleton. ‘Four walls ceiling! (why do not kill Cricket? _I_ would! I always do. I hate noise.) There four walls ceiling house. Come me!’ ‘You kill Crickets, eh?’ said John. ‘Scrunch  them, sir,’ returned other, setting his heel heavily floor. ‘You will say you will come? It is much interest mine, know, women persuade they are quiet contented, could not better off. I know way. Whatever one woman says, another woman determined clinch, always. There is spirit emulation among  them, sir, wife says wife, “I am happiest woman world, mine’s best husband world, I dote him,” wife say yours, more, half believe it.’ ‘Do mean say she do not, then?’ asked Carrier. ‘Do not!’ cried Tackleton, short, sharp laugh. ‘Do not what?’ The Carrier faint idea adding, ‘dote upon you.’ But, happening meet half-closed eye, twinkled upon turned-up collar cape, within ace poking out, he felt unlikely part parcel anything doted on, he substituted, ‘that she do not believe it?’ ‘Ah dog! You are joking,’ said Tackleton. But Carrier, though slow understand full drift his meaning, eyed serious manner, he obliged little explanatory. ‘I humour,’ said Tackleton: holding fingers his left hand, tapping forefinger, imply ‘there I am, Tackleton wit:’ ‘I humour, sir, marry young wife, pretty wife:’ he rapped his little finger, express Bride; sparingly, sharply; sense power. ‘I am able gratify humour I do. It is whim. But—now look there!’ He pointed Dot sitting, thoughtfully, fire; leaning her dimpled chin upon her hand, watching bright blaze. The Carrier looked her, him, her, again. ‘She honours obeys, doubt, know,’ said Tackleton; ‘and that, I man sentiment, quite enough _me_. But think there is anything it?’ ‘I think,’ observed Carrier, ‘that I chuck man window, said was not.’ ‘Exactly so,’ returned unusual alacrity assent. ‘To sure! Doubtless would. Of course. I am certain it. Good night. Pleasant dreams!’ The Carrier puzzled, made uncomfortable uncertain, spite himself. He could not help showing it, his manner. ‘Good night, dear friend!’ said Tackleton, compassionately. ‘I am off. We are exactly alike, reality, I see. You will not give us to-morrow evening? Well! Next day go visiting, I know. I will meet there, bring wife be. It will her good. You are agreeable? Thank’ee. What is that!’ It loud cry Carrier’s wife: loud, sharp, sudden cry, made room ring, like glass vessel. She risen her seat, stood like one transfixed terror surprise. The Stranger advanced towards fire warm himself, stood within short stride her chair. But quite still. ‘Dot!’ cried Carrier. ‘Mary! Darling! What is matter?’ They her moment. Caleb, dozing cake-box, first imperfect recovery his suspended presence mind, seized Miss Slowboy hair her head, immediately apologised. ‘Mary!’ exclaimed Carrier, supporting her his arms. ‘Are ill! What it? Tell me, dear!’ She answered beating her hands together, falling wild fit laughter. Then, sinking his grasp upon ground, she covered her face her apron, wept bitterly. And she laughed again, she cried again, she said cold was, suffered lead her fire, she sat before. The old man standing, before, quite still. ‘I am better, John,’ she said. ‘I am quite well now—I—’ ‘John!’ But John side her. Why turn her face towards strange old gentleman, addressing him! Was her brain wandering? ‘Only fancy, John dear—a kind shock—a something coming suddenly eyes—I do not know was. It is quite gone, quite gone.’ ‘I am glad it is gone,’ muttered Tackleton, turning expressive eye round room. ‘I wonder it is gone, was. Humph! Caleb, come here! Who is grey hair?’ ‘I do not know, sir,’ returned Caleb whisper. ‘Never see before, life. A beautiful figure nut-cracker; quite new model. With screw-jaw opening his waistcoat, he would lovely.’ ‘Not ugly enough,’ said Tackleton. ‘Or firebox, either,’ observed Caleb, deep contemplation, ‘what model! Unscrew his head put matches in; turn heels up’ards light; firebox gentleman’s mantel-shelf, he stands!’ ‘Not half ugly enough,’ said Tackleton. ‘Nothing all! Come! Bring box! All right now, I hope?’ ‘Oh quite gone! Quite gone!’ said little woman, waving hurriedly away. ‘Good night!’ ‘Good night,’ said Tackleton. ‘Good night, John Peerybingle! Take care carry box, Caleb. Let fall, I will murder you! Dark pitch, weather worse ever, eh? Good night!’ So, another sharp look round room, he went door; followed Caleb wedding-cake his head. The Carrier much astounded his little wife, busily engaged soothing tending her, he scarcely conscious Stranger’s presence, now, he stood there, guest. ‘He do not belong them, see,’ said John. ‘I must give hint go.’ ‘I beg pardon, friend,’ said old gentleman, advancing him; ‘the so, I fear wife well; Attendant infirmity,’ he touched his ears shook his head, ‘renders almost indispensable, arrived, I fear must mistake. The bad night made shelter comfortable cart (may I never worse!) acceptable, still bad ever. Would you, kindness, suffer rent bed here?’ ‘Yes, yes,’ cried Dot. ‘Yes! Certainly!’ ‘Oh!’ said Carrier, surprised rapidity consent. ‘Well! I do not object; but, still I am quite sure that—’ ‘Hush!’ she interrupted. ‘Dear John!’ ‘Why, he is stone deaf,’ urged John. ‘I know he is, but—Yes, sir, certainly. Yes! certainly! I will make bed, directly, John.’ As she hurried it, flutter her spirits, agitation her manner, strange Carrier stood looking her, quite confounded. ‘Did mothers make Beds then!’ cried Miss Slowboy Baby; ‘and hair grow brown curly, caps lifted off, frighten it, precious Pets, a-sitting fires!’ With unaccountable attraction mind trifles, often incidental state doubt confusion, Carrier he walked slowly fro, found mentally repeating even absurd words, many times. So many times he got heart, still conning over, like lesson, Tilly, administering much friction little bald head her hand she thought wholesome (according practice nurses), tied Baby’s cap on. ‘And frighten it, precious Pets, a-sitting fires. What frightened Dot, I wonder!’ mused Carrier, pacing fro. He scouted, his heart, insinuations Toy-merchant, yet filled vague, indefinite uneasiness. For, Tackleton quick sly; he painful sense, himself, man slow perception, broken hint always worrying him. He certainly intention his mind linking anything Tackleton said, unusual conduct his wife, two subjects reflection came his mind together, he could keep asunder. The bed soon made ready; visitor, declining refreshment cup tea, retired. Then, Dot—quite well again, she said, quite well again—arranged great chair chimney-corner her husband; filled his pipe gave him; took her usual little stool beside hearth. She always _would_ sit little stool. I think she must kind notion coaxing, wheedling little stool. She was, out, best filler pipe, I say, four quarters globe. To see her put chubby little finger bowl, blow pipe clear tube, and, she done so, affect think really something tube, blow dozen times, hold her eye like telescope, provoking twist her capital little face, she looked it, quite brilliant thing. As tobacco, she perfect mistress subject; her lighting pipe, wisp paper, Carrier his mouth—going near his nose, yet scorching it—was Art, high Art. And Cricket kettle, turning again, acknowledged it! The bright fire, blazing again, acknowledged it! The little Mower clock, his unheeded work, acknowledged it! The Carrier, his smoothing forehead expanding face, acknowledged it, readiest all. And he soberly thoughtfully puffed his old pipe, Dutch clock ticked, red fire gleamed, Cricket chirped; Genius his Hearth Home (for Cricket was) came out, fairy shape, room, summoned many forms Home him. Dots ages, sizes, filled chamber. Dots merry children, running gathering flowers, fields; coy Dots, half shrinking from, half yielding to, pleading his rough image; newly-married Dots, alighting door, taking wondering possession household keys; motherly little Dots, attended fictitious Slowboys, bearing babies christened; matronly Dots, still young blooming, watching Dots daughters, danced rustic balls; fat Dots, encircled beset troops rosy grandchildren; withered Dots, leaned sticks, tottered crept along. Old Carriers too, appeared, blind old Boxers lying feet; newer carts younger drivers (‘Peerybingle Brothers’ tilt); sick old Carriers, tended gentlest hands; graves dead gone old Carriers, green churchyard. And Cricket showed things—he saw plainly, though his eyes fixed upon fire—the Carrier’s heart grew light happy, he thanked his Household Gods his might, cared Gruff Tackleton do. * * * * * But, young figure man, Fairy Cricket set near Her stool, remained there, singly alone? Why linger still, near her, arm upon chimney-piece, ever repeating ‘Married! me!’ O Dot! O failing Dot! There place husband’s visions; shadow fallen his hearth! CHAPTER II—Chirp Second Caleb Plummer his Blind Daughter lived alone themselves, Story-books say—and blessing, back I hope, Story-books, saying anything workaday world!—Caleb Plummer his Blind Daughter lived alone themselves, little cracked nutshell wooden house, was, truth, better pimple prominent red-brick nose Gruff Tackleton. The premises Gruff Tackleton great feature street; might knocked Caleb Plummer’s dwelling hammer two, carried pieces cart. If one done dwelling-house Caleb Plummer honour miss inroad, would been, doubt, commend demolition vast improvement. It stuck premises Gruff Tackleton, like barnacle ship’s keel, snail door, little bunch toadstools stem tree. But, germ full-grown trunk Gruff Tackleton sprung; and, crazy roof, Gruff last, had, small way, made toys generation old boys girls, played them, found out, broken them, gone sleep. I said Caleb his poor Blind Daughter lived here. I said Caleb lived here, his poor Blind Daughter somewhere else—in enchanted home Caleb’s furnishing, scarcity shabbiness not, trouble never entered. Caleb sorcerer, magic art still remains us, magic devoted, deathless love, Nature mistress his study; her teaching, wonder came. The Blind Girl never knew ceilings discoloured, walls blotched bare plaster there, high crevices unstopped widening every day, beams mouldering tending downward. The Blind Girl never knew iron rusting, wood rotting, paper peeling off; size, shape, true proportion dwelling, withering away. The Blind Girl never knew ugly shapes delf earthenware board; sorrow faintheartedness house; Caleb’s scanty hairs turning greyer grey, her sightless face. The Blind Girl never knew master, cold, exacting, uninterested—never knew Tackleton Tackleton short; lived belief eccentric humourist loved his jest them, who, he Guardian Angel lives, disdained hear one word thankfulness. And Caleb’s doing; her simple father! But he Cricket his Hearth; listening sadly music motherless Blind Child young, Spirit inspired thought even her great deprivation might almost changed blessing, girl made happy little means. For Cricket tribe potent Spirits, even though people hold converse know (which frequently case); unseen world, voices gentle true, may implicitly relied on, certain give none tenderest counsel, Voices Spirits Fireside Hearth address human kind. Caleb his daughter work together usual working-room, served ordinary living-room well; strange place was. There houses it, finished unfinished, Dolls stations life. Suburban tenements Dolls moderate means; kitchens single apartments Dolls lower classes; capital town residences Dolls high estate. Some establishments already furnished according estimate, view convenience Dolls limited income; others could fitted expensive scale, moment’s notice, whole shelves chairs tables, sofas, bedsteads, upholstery. The nobility gentry, public general, whose accommodation tenements designed, lay, there, baskets, staring straight ceiling; but, denoting degrees society, confining respective stations (which experience shows lamentably difficult real life), makers Dolls far improved Nature, often froward perverse; for, they, resting arbitrary marks satin, cotton-print, bits rag, superadded striking personal differences allowed mistake. Thus, Doll-lady distinction wax limbs perfect symmetry; she her compeers. The next grade social scale made leather, next coarse linen stuff. As common-people, many matches tinder-boxes, arms legs, were—established sphere once, beyond possibility getting it. There various samples his handicraft, besides Dolls, Caleb Plummer’s room. There Noah’s Arks, Birds Beasts uncommonly tight fit, I assure you; though could crammed in, anyhow, roof, rattled shaken smallest compass. By bold poetical licence, Noah’s Arks knockers doors; inconsistent appendages, perhaps, suggestive morning callers Postman, yet pleasant finish outside building. There scores melancholy little carts, which, wheels went round, performed doleful music. Many small fiddles, drums, instruments torture; end cannon, shields, swords, spears, guns. There little tumblers red breeches, incessantly swarming high obstacles red-tape, coming down, head first, side; innumerable old gentlemen respectable, say venerable, appearance, insanely flying horizontal pegs, inserted, purpose, street doors. There beasts sorts; horses, particular, every breed, spotted barrel four pegs, small tippet mane, thoroughbred rocker his highest mettle. As would hard count dozens upon dozens grotesque figures ever ready commit sorts absurdities turning handle, would easy task mention human folly, vice, weakness, type, immediate remote, Caleb Plummer’s room. And exaggerated form, little handles move men women strange performances, Toy ever made undertake. In midst objects, Caleb his daughter sat work. The Blind Girl busy Doll’s dressmaker; Caleb painting glazing four-pair front desirable family mansion. The care imprinted lines Caleb’s face, his absorbed dreamy manner, would sat well alchemist abstruse student, first sight odd contrast his occupation, trivialities him. But, trivial things, invented pursued bread, become serious matters fact; and, apart consideration, I prepared say, myself, Caleb Lord Chamberlain, Member Parliament, lawyer, even great speculator, he would dealt toys one whit less whimsical, I great doubt whether would harmless. ‘So rain last night, father, beautiful new great-coat,’ said Caleb’s daughter. ‘In beautiful new great-coat,’ answered Caleb, glancing towards clothes-line room, sack-cloth garment previously described, carefully hung dry. ‘How glad I bought it, father!’ ‘And tailor, too,’ said Caleb. ‘Quite fashionable tailor. It is good me.’ The Blind Girl rested her work, laughed delight. ‘Too good, father! What good you?’ ‘I am half-ashamed wear though,’ said Caleb, watching effect he said, upon her brightening face; ‘upon word! When I hear boys people say behind me, “Hal-loa! Here is swell!” I do not know way look. And beggar would not go away last night; I said I common man, said “No, Honour! Bless Honour, do not say that!” I quite ashamed. I really felt I had not right wear it.’ Happy Blind Girl! How merry she was, her exultation! ‘I see you, father,’ she said, clasping her hands, ‘as plainly, I eyes I never want me. A blue coat—’ ‘Bright blue,’ said Caleb. ‘Yes, yes! Bright blue!’ exclaimed girl, turning her radiant face; ‘the colour I remember blessed sky! You told blue before! A bright blue coat—’ ‘Made loose figure,’ suggested Caleb. ‘Made loose figure!’ cried Blind Girl, laughing heartily; ‘and it, you, dear father, merry eye, smiling face, free step, dark hair—looking young handsome!’ ‘Halloa! Halloa!’ said Caleb. ‘I shall vain, presently!’ ‘I think are, already,’ cried Blind Girl, pointing him, her glee. ‘I know you, father! Ha, ha, ha! I have found out, see!’ How different picture her mind, Caleb, he sat observing her! She spoken his free step. She right that. For years years, he never crossed threshold his slow pace, footfall counterfeited her ear; never he, his heart heaviest, forgotten light tread render cheerful courageous! Heaven knows! But I think Caleb’s vague bewilderment manner may half originated his confused everything around him, love his Blind Daughter. How could little man otherwise bewildered, labouring many years destroy his identity, objects bearing it! ‘There are,’ said Caleb, falling back pace two form better judgment his work; ‘as near real thing sixpenn’orth halfpence sixpence. What pity whole front house opens once! If staircase it, now, regular doors rooms go at! But that is worst calling, I am always deluding myself, swindling myself.’ ‘You speaking quite softly. You tired, father?’ ‘Tired!’ echoed Caleb, great burst animation, ‘what tire me, Bertha? _I_ never tired. What mean?’ To give greater force his words, he checked involuntary imitation two half-length stretching yawning figures mantel-shelf, represented one eternal state weariness waist upwards; hummed fragment song. It Bacchanalian song, something Sparkling Bowl. He sang assumption Devil-may-care voice, made his face thousand times meagre thoughtful ever. ‘What! You are singing, you?’ said Tackleton, putting his head door. ‘Go it! _I_ cannot sing.’ Nobody would suspected it. He had not generally termed singing face, means. ‘I cannot afford sing,’ said Tackleton. ‘I am glad _you can_. I hope afford work too. Hardly time both, I think?’ ‘If could see him, Bertha, he is winking me!’ whispered Caleb. ‘Such man joke! you would think, did not know him, he earnest—would not now?’ The Blind Girl smiled nodded. ‘The bird sing will not sing, must made sing, say,’ grumbled Tackleton. ‘What owl cannot sing, ought not sing, sing; anything _he_ made do?’ ‘The extent he is winking moment!’ whispered Caleb his daughter. ‘O, gracious!’ ‘Always merry light-hearted us!’ cried smiling Bertha. ‘O, you are there, you?’ answered Tackleton. ‘Poor Idiot!’ He really believe she Idiot; he founded belief, I cannot say whether consciously not, upon her fond him. ‘Well! there,—how you?’ said Tackleton, his grudging way. ‘Oh! well; quite well. And happy even wish be. As happy would make whole world, could!’ ‘Poor Idiot!’ muttered Tackleton. ‘No gleam reason. Not gleam!’ The Blind Girl took his hand kissed it; held moment her two hands; laid her cheek tenderly, releasing it. There unspeakable affection fervent gratitude act, Tackleton moved say, milder growl usual: ‘What is matter now?’ ‘I stood close beside pillow I went sleep last night, remembered dreams. And day broke, glorious red sun—the _red_ sun, father?’ ‘Red mornings evenings, Bertha,’ said poor Caleb, woeful glance his employer. ‘When rose, bright light I almost fear strike walking, came room, I turned little tree towards it, blessed Heaven making things precious, blessed sending cheer me!’ ‘Bedlam broke loose!’ said Tackleton his breath. ‘We shall arrive strait-waistcoat mufflers soon. We are getting on!’ Caleb, his hands hooked loosely other, stared vacantly his daughter spoke, he really uncertain (I believe he was) whether Tackleton done anything deserve her thanks, not. If he could perfectly free agent, moment, required, pain death, kick Toy-merchant, fall his feet, according his merits, I believe would even chance course he would taken. Yet, Caleb knew his hands he brought little rose-tree home her, carefully, his lips he forged innocent deception help keep her suspecting much, much, he every day, denied himself, she might happier. ‘Bertha!’ said Tackleton, assuming, nonce, little cordiality. ‘Come here.’ ‘Oh! I come straight you! You need not guide me!’ she rejoined. ‘Shall I tell secret, Bertha?’ ‘If will!’ she answered, eagerly. How bright darkened face! How adorned light, listening head! ‘This day little what is-her-name, spoilt child, Peerybingle’s wife, pays her regular visit you—makes her fantastic Pic-Nic here; an’t it?’ said Tackleton, strong expression distaste whole concern. ‘Yes,’ replied Bertha. ‘This day.’ ‘I thought so,’ said Tackleton. ‘I like join party.’ ‘Do hear that, father!’ cried Blind Girl ecstasy. ‘Yes, yes, I hear it,’ murmured Caleb, fixed look sleep-walker; ‘but I do not believe it. It is one lies, I have doubt.’ ‘You see I—I want bring Peerybingles little company May Fielding,’ said Tackleton. ‘I going married May.’ ‘Married!’ cried Blind Girl, starting him. ‘She is con-founded Idiot,’ muttered Tackleton, ‘that I afraid she would never comprehend me. Ah, Bertha! Married! Church, parson, clerk, beadle, glass-coach, bells, breakfast, bride-cake, favours, marrow-bones, cleavers, rest tom-foolery. A wedding, know; wedding. Do not know wedding is?’ ‘I know,’ replied Blind Girl, gentle tone. ‘I understand!’ ‘Do you?’ muttered Tackleton. ‘It is I expected. Well! On account I want join party, bring May her mother. I will send little something other, afternoon. A cold leg mutton, comfortable trifle sort. You will expect me?’ ‘Yes,’ she answered. She drooped her head, turned away; stood, her hands crossed, musing. ‘I do not think will,’ muttered Tackleton, looking her; ‘for seem forgotten it, already. Caleb!’ ‘I may venture say I am here, I suppose,’ thought Caleb. ‘Sir!’ ‘Take care she do not forget I have saying her.’ ‘_She_ never forgets,’ returned Caleb. ‘It is one things she an’t clever in.’ ‘Every man thinks his geese swans,’ observed Toy-merchant, shrug. ‘Poor devil!’ Having delivered remark, infinite contempt, old Gruff Tackleton withdrew. Bertha remained he left her, lost meditation. The gaiety vanished her downcast face, sad. Three four times she shook her head, bewailing remembrance loss; her sorrowful reflections found vent words. It Caleb occupied, time, yoking team horses waggon summary process nailing harness vital parts bodies, she drew near his working-stool, sitting beside him, said: ‘Father, I lonely dark. I want eyes, patient, willing eyes.’ ‘Here are,’ said Caleb. ‘Always ready. They mine, Bertha, hour four-and-twenty. What shall eyes you, dear?’ ‘Look round room, father.’ ‘All right,’ said Caleb. ‘No sooner said done, Bertha.’ ‘Tell it.’ ‘It is much usual,’ said Caleb. ‘Homely, snug. The gay colours walls; bright flowers plates dishes; shining wood, beams panels; general cheerfulness neatness building; make pretty.’ Cheerful neat wherever Bertha’s hands could busy themselves. But nowhere else, cheerfulness neatness possible, old crazy she would Caleb’s fancy transformed. ‘You working dress on, gallant wear handsome coat?’ said Bertha, touching him. ‘Not quite gallant,’ answered Caleb. ‘Pretty brisk though.’ ‘Father,’ said Blind Girl, drawing close his side, stealing one arm round his neck, ‘tell something May. She fair?’ ‘She indeed,’ said Caleb. And she indeed. It quite rare thing Caleb, draw his invention. ‘Her hair dark,’ said Bertha, pensively, ‘darker mine. Her voice sweet musical, I know. I often loved hear it. Her shape—’ ‘There is Doll’s room equal it,’ said Caleb. ‘And her eyes!—’ He stopped; Bertha drawn closer round his neck, arm clung him, came warning pressure he understood well. He coughed moment, hammered moment, fell back upon song sparkling bowl; his infallible resource difficulties. ‘Our friend, father, benefactor. I never tired, know, hearing him.—Now, I ever?’ she said, hastily. ‘Of course not,’ answered Caleb, ‘and reason.’ ‘Ah! With much reason!’ cried Blind Girl. With fervency, Caleb, though his motives pure, could endure meet her face; dropped his eyes, she could read his innocent deceit. ‘Then, tell him, dear father,’ said Bertha. ‘Many times again! His face benevolent, kind, tender. Honest true, I sure is. The manly heart tries cloak favours show roughness unwillingness, beats every look glance.’ ‘And makes noble!’ added Caleb, his quiet desperation. ‘And makes noble!’ cried Blind Girl. ‘He older May, father.’ ‘Ye-es,’ said Caleb, reluctantly. ‘He is little older May. But do not signify.’ ‘Oh father, yes! To his patient companion infirmity age; his gentle nurse sickness, his constant friend suffering sorrow; know weariness working his sake; watch him, tend him, sit beside his bed talk awake, pray asleep; privileges would be! What opportunities proving her truth devotion him! Would she this, dear father? ‘No doubt it,’ said Caleb. ‘I love her, father; I love her soul!’ exclaimed Blind Girl. And saying so, she laid her poor blind face Caleb’s shoulder, wept wept, he almost sorry brought tearful happiness upon her. In mean time, pretty sharp commotion John Peerybingle’s, little Mrs. Peerybingle naturally could not think going anywhere without Baby; get Baby weigh took time. Not much Baby, speaking thing weight measure, vast deal it, done easy stages. For instance, Baby got, hook crook, certain point dressing, might rationally supposed another touch two would finish off, turn tip-top Baby challenging world, he unexpectedly extinguished flannel cap, hustled bed; he simmered (so speak) two blankets best part hour. From state inaction he recalled, shining much roaring violently, partake of—well? I would rather say, you will permit speak generally—of slight repast. After which, he went sleep again. Mrs. Peerybingle took advantage interval, make herself smart small way ever saw anybody life; and, short truce, Miss Slowboy insinuated herself spencer fashion surprising ingenious, connection herself, anything else universe, shrunken, dog’s-eared, independent fact, pursuing lonely course without least regard anybody. By time, Baby, alive again, invested, united efforts Mrs. Peerybingle Miss Slowboy, cream-coloured mantle body, sort nankeen raised-pie head; course time three got door, old horse already taken full value his day’s toll Turnpike Trust, tearing road his impatient autographs; whence Boxer might dimly seen remote perspective, standing looking back, tempting come without orders. As chair, anything kind helping Mrs. Peerybingle cart, know little John, think _that_ necessary. Before could seen lift her ground, she her place, fresh rosy, saying, ‘John! How _can_ you! Think Tilly!’ If I might allowed mention young lady’s legs, terms, I would observe Miss Slowboy’s fatality rendered singularly liable grazed; she never effected smallest ascent descent, without recording circumstance upon notch, Robinson Crusoe marked days upon his wooden calendar. But might considered ungenteel, I will think it. ‘John? You have got Basket Veal Ham-Pie things, bottles Beer?’ said Dot. ‘If have not, must turn round again, minute.’ ‘You are nice little article,’ returned Carrier, ‘to talking turning round, keeping full quarter hour behind time.’ ‘I sorry it, John,’ said Dot great bustle, ‘but I really could think going Bertha’s—I would it, John, account—without Veal Ham-Pie things, bottles Beer. Way!’ This monosyllable addressed horse, did not mind all. ‘Oh _do_ way, John!’ said Mrs. Peerybingle. ‘Please!’ ‘It will time enough that,’ returned John, ‘when I begin leave things behind me. The basket’s here, safe enough.’ ‘What hard-hearted monster must be, John, said so, once, save turn! I declared I would not go Bertha’s without Veal Ham-Pie things, bottles Beer, money. Regularly fortnight ever since married, John, made little Pic-Nic there. If anything go wrong it, I almost think never lucky again.’ ‘It kind thought first instance,’ said Carrier: ‘and I honour it, little woman.’ ‘My dear John,’ replied Dot, turning red, ‘do not talk honouring _me_. Good Gracious!’ ‘By bye—’ observed Carrier. ‘That old gentleman—’ Again visibly, instantly embarrassed! ‘He is odd fish,’ said Carrier, looking straight along road them. ‘I cannot make out. I do not believe there is harm him.’ ‘None all. I am—I am sure there is none all.’ ‘Yes,’ said Carrier, his eyes attracted her face great earnestness her manner. ‘I glad feel certain it, it is confirmation me. It is curious he taken his head ask leave go lodging us; an’t it? Things come strangely.’ ‘So strangely,’ she rejoined low voice, scarcely audible. ‘However, he is good-natured old gentleman,’ said John, ‘and pays gentleman, I think his word relied upon, like gentleman’s. I quite long talk morning: he hear better already, he says, he gets used voice. He told great deal himself, I told great deal myself, rare lot questions he asked me. I gave information two beats, know, business; one day right house back again; another day left house back (for he is stranger do not know names places here); he seemed quite pleased. “Why, I shall returning home to-night way,” he says, “when I thought you would coming exactly opposite direction. That is capital! I may trouble another lift perhaps, I will engage fall sound asleep again.” He _was_ sound asleep, sure-ly!—Dot! thinking of?’ ‘Thinking of, John? I—I listening you.’ ‘O! That is right!’ said honest Carrier. ‘I afraid, look face, I gone rambling long, set thinking something else. I near it, I will bound.’ Dot making reply, jogged on, little time, silence. But, easy remain silent long John Peerybingle’s cart, everybody road something say. Though might ‘How you!’ indeed often nothing else, still, give back right spirit cordiality, required, merely nod smile, wholesome action lungs withal, long-winded Parliamentary speech. Sometimes, passengers foot, horseback, plodded little way beside cart, express purpose chat; great deal said, sides. Then, Boxer gave occasion good-natured recognitions of, by, Carrier, half-a-dozen Christians could done! Everybody knew him, along road—especially fowls pigs, saw approaching, his body one side, his ears pricked inquisitively, knob tail making air, immediately withdrew remote back settlements, without waiting honour nearer acquaintance. He business everywhere; going turnings, looking wells, bolting cottages, dashing midst Dame-Schools, fluttering pigeons, magnifying tails cats, trotting public-houses like regular customer. Wherever he went, somebody might heard cry, ‘Halloa! Here is Boxer!’ came somebody forthwith, accompanied least two three somebodies, give John Peerybingle his pretty wife, Good Day. The packages parcels errand cart, numerous; many stoppages take give out, means worst parts journey. Some people full expectation parcels, people full wonder parcels, people full inexhaustible directions parcels, John lively interest parcels, good play. Likewise, articles carry, required considered discussed, reference adjustment disposition which, councils holden Carrier senders: Boxer usually assisted, short fits closest attention, long fits tearing round round assembled sages barking hoarse. Of little incidents, Dot amused open-eyed spectatress her chair cart; she sat there, looking on—a charming little portrait framed admiration tilt—there lack nudgings glancings whisperings envyings among younger men. And delighted John Carrier, beyond measure; he proud his little wife admired, knowing she did not mind it—that, anything, she rather liked perhaps. The trip little foggy, sure, January weather; raw cold. But cared trifles? Not Dot, decidedly. Not Tilly Slowboy, she deemed sitting cart, terms, highest point human joys; crowning circumstance earthly hopes. Not Baby, I will sworn; it is Baby nature warmer sound asleep, though capacity great respects, blessed young Peerybingle was, way. You could not see far fog, course; could see great deal! It is astonishing much may see, thicker fog that, take trouble look it. Why, even sit watching Fairy-rings fields, patches hoar-frost still lingering shade, near hedges trees, pleasant occupation: make mention unexpected shapes trees came starting mist, glided again. The hedges tangled bare, waved multitude blighted garlands wind; discouragement this. It agreeable contemplate; made fireside warmer possession, summer greener expectancy. The river looked chilly; motion, moving good pace—which great point. The canal rather slow torpid; must admitted. Never mind. It would freeze sooner frost set fairly in, would skating, sliding; heavy old barges, frozen somewhere near wharf, would smoke rusty iron chimney pipes day, lazy time it. In one place, great mound weeds stubble burning; watched fire, white daytime, flaring fog, dash red it, until, consequence, she observed, smoke ‘getting her nose,’ Miss Slowboy choked—she could anything sort, smallest provocation—and woke Baby, would not go sleep again. But, Boxer, advance quarter mile so, already passed outposts town, gained corner street Caleb his daughter lived; long reached door, he Blind Girl pavement waiting receive them. Boxer, way, made certain delicate distinctions his own, his communication Bertha, persuade fully he knew her blind. He never sought attract her attention looking her, he often people, touched her invariably. What experience he could ever blind people blind dogs, I do not know. He never lived blind master; Mr. Boxer elder, Mrs. Boxer, his respectable family either side, ever visited blindness, I aware of. He may found himself, perhaps, he got hold somehow; therefore he hold Bertha too, skirt, kept hold, Mrs. Peerybingle Baby, Miss Slowboy, basket, got safely within doors. May Fielding already come; her mother—a little querulous chip old lady peevish face, who, right preserved waist like bedpost, supposed transcendent figure; who, consequence better off, labouring impression she might been, something happened never happen, seemed never particularly likely come pass—but it is same—was genteel patronising indeed. Gruff Tackleton also there, agreeable, evident sensation perfectly home, unquestionably his element, fresh young salmon top Great Pyramid. ‘May! My dear old friend!’ cried Dot, running meet her. ‘What happiness see you.’ Her old friend was, full, hearty glad she; really was, you will believe me, quite pleasant sight see embrace. Tackleton man taste beyond question. May pretty. You know sometimes, used pretty face, how, comes contact comparison another pretty face, seems moment homely faded, hardly deserve high opinion it. Now, case, either Dot May; May’s face set Dot’s, Dot’s face set May’s, naturally agreeably, that, John Peerybingle near saying he came room, ought born sisters—which improvement could suggested. Tackleton brought his leg mutton, and, wonderful relate, tart besides—but do not mind little dissipation brides case; do not get married every day—and addition dainties, Veal Ham-Pie, ‘things,’ Mrs. Peerybingle called them; chiefly nuts oranges, cakes, small deer. When repast set forth board, flanked Caleb’s contribution, great wooden bowl smoking potatoes (he prohibited, solemn compact, producing viands), Tackleton led his intended mother-in-law post honour. For better gracing place high festival, majestic old soul adorned herself cap, calculated inspire thoughtless sentiments awe. She also wore her gloves. But let us genteel, die! Caleb sat next his daughter; Dot her old schoolfellow side side; good Carrier took care bottom table. Miss Slowboy isolated, time being, every article furniture chair she sat on, she might nothing else knock Baby’s head against. As Tilly stared her dolls toys, stared her company. The venerable old gentlemen street doors (who full action) showed especial interest party, pausing occasionally leaping, listening conversation, plunging wildly over, great many times, without halting breath—as frantic state delight whole proceedings. Certainly, old gentlemen inclined fiendish joy contemplation Tackleton’s discomfiture, good reason satisfied. Tackleton could not get all; cheerful his intended bride became Dot’s society, less he liked it, though he brought together purpose. For he regular dog manger, Tackleton; laughed he could not, he took his head, immediately, must laughing him. ‘Ah, May!’ said Dot. ‘Dear dear, changes! To talk merry school-days makes one young again.’ ‘Why, an’t particularly old, time; you?’ said Tackleton. ‘Look sober plodding husband there,’ returned Dot. ‘He adds twenty years age least. Do not you, John?’ ‘Forty,’ John replied. ‘How many _you_’ll add May’s, I sure I do not know,’ said Dot, laughing. ‘But she cannot much less hundred years age her next birthday.’ ‘Ha ha!’ laughed Tackleton. Hollow drum, laugh though. And he looked he could twisted Dot’s neck, comfortably. ‘Dear dear!’ said Dot. ‘Only remember used talk, school, husbands would choose. I do not know young, handsome, gay, lively, mine be! And May’s!—Ah dear! I do not know whether laugh cry, I think silly girls were.’ May seemed know do; colour flushed her face, tears stood her eyes. ‘Even persons themselves—real live young men—were fixed sometimes,’ said Dot. ‘We little thought things would come about. I never fixed John I am sure; I never much thought him. And I told you, ever married Mr. Tackleton, you would slapped me. Would not you, May?’ Though May did not say yes, she certainly did not say no, express no, means. Tackleton laughed—quite shouted, he laughed loud. John Peerybingle laughed too, his ordinary good-natured contented manner; his mere whisper laugh, Tackleton’s. ‘You could not help yourselves, that. You could not resist us, see,’ said Tackleton. ‘Here are! Here are!’ ‘Where gay young bridegrooms now!’ ‘Some dead,’ said Dot; ‘and forgotten. Some them, could stand among us moment, would believe creatures; would believe saw heard real, _could_ forget so. No! would believe one word it!’ ‘Why, Dot!’ exclaimed Carrier. ‘Little woman!’ She spoken earnestness fire, she stood need recalling herself, without doubt. Her husband’s check gentle, he merely interfered, he supposed, shield old Tackleton; proved effectual, she stopped, said more. There uncommon agitation, even her silence, wary Tackleton, brought his half-shut eye bear upon her, noted closely, remembered purpose too. May uttered word, good bad, sat quite still, her eyes cast down, made sign interest passed. The good lady her mother interposed, observing, first instance, girls girls, byegones byegones, long young people young thoughtless, would probably conduct like young thoughtless persons: two three positions less sound incontrovertible character. She remarked, devout spirit, she thanked Heaven she always found her daughter May, dutiful obedient child; she took credit herself, though she every reason believe entirely owing herself. With regard Mr. Tackleton she said, That he moral point view undeniable individual, That he eligible point view son-in-law desired, one senses could doubt. (She emphatic here.) With regard family he soon about, solicitation, admitted, she believed Mr. Tackleton knew that, although reduced purse, pretensions gentility; certain circumstances, wholly unconnected, she would go far say, Indigo Trade, she would particularly refer, happened differently, might perhaps possession wealth. She remarked she would allude past, would mention her daughter time rejected suit Mr. Tackleton; she would say great many things she say, great length. Finally, she delivered general result her observation experience, marriages least romantically sillily called love, always happiest; she anticipated greatest possible amount bliss—not rapturous bliss; solid, steady-going article—from approaching nuptials. She concluded informing company to-morrow day she lived for, expressly; over, she would desire nothing better packed disposed of, genteel place burial. As remarks quite unanswerable—which happy property remarks sufficiently wide purpose—they changed current conversation, diverted general attention Veal Ham-Pie, cold mutton, potatoes, tart. In order bottled beer might slighted, John Peerybingle proposed To-morrow: Wedding-Day; called upon drink bumper it, he proceeded his journey. For ought know he rested there, gave old horse bait. He go four five miles farther on; he returned evening, he called Dot, took another rest his way home. This order day Pic-Nic occasions, been, ever since institution. There two persons present, besides bride bridegroom elect, indifferent honour toast. One Dot, flushed discomposed adapt herself small occurrence moment; other, Bertha, rose hurriedly, rest, left table. ‘Good bye!’ said stout John Peerybingle, pulling his dreadnought coat. ‘I shall back old time. Good bye all!’ ‘Good bye, John,’ returned Caleb. He seemed say rote, wave his hand unconscious manner; he stood observing Bertha anxious wondering face, never altered expression. ‘Good bye, young shaver!’ said jolly Carrier, bending kiss child; Tilly Slowboy, intent upon her knife fork, deposited asleep (and strange say, without damage) little cot Bertha’s furnishing; ‘good bye! Time come, I suppose, _you’ll_ turn cold, little friend, leave old father enjoy his pipe his rheumatics chimney-corner; eh? Where is Dot?’ ‘I am here, John!’ she said, starting. ‘Come, come!’ returned Carrier, clapping his sounding hands. ‘Where is pipe?’ ‘I quite forgot pipe, John.’ Forgot pipe! Was wonder ever heard of! She! Forgot pipe! ‘I will—I will fill directly. It is soon done.’ But soon done, either. It lay usual place—the Carrier’s dreadnought pocket—with little pouch, her work, she used fill it, her hand shook so, she entangled (and yet her hand small enough come easily, I sure), bungled terribly. The filling pipe lighting it, little offices I commended her discretion, vilely done, first last. During whole process, Tackleton stood looking maliciously half-closed eye; which, whenever met hers—or caught it, hardly said ever met another eye: rather kind trap snatch up—augmented her confusion remarkable degree. ‘Why, clumsy Dot are, afternoon!’ said John. ‘I could done better myself, I verily believe!’ With good-natured words, he strode away, presently heard, company Boxer, old horse, cart, making lively music road. What time dreamy Caleb still stood, watching his blind daughter, expression his face. ‘Bertha!’ said Caleb, softly. ‘What happened? How changed are, darling, hours—since morning. _You_ silent dull day! What it? Tell me!’ ‘Oh father, father!’ cried Blind Girl, bursting tears. ‘Oh hard, hard fate!’ Caleb drew his hand across his eyes he answered her. ‘But think cheerful happy been, Bertha! How good, much loved, many people.’ ‘That strikes heart, dear father! Always mindful me! Always kind me!’ Caleb much perplexed understand her. ‘To be—to blind, Bertha, poor dear,’ he faltered, ‘is great affliction; but—’ ‘I never felt it!’ cried Blind Girl. ‘I never felt it, fulness. Never! I sometimes wished I could see you, could see him—only once, dear father, one little minute—that I might know I treasure up,’ she laid her hands upon her breast, ‘and hold here! That I might sure right! And sometimes (but I child) I wept prayers night, think images ascended heart Heaven, might true resemblance yourselves. But I never feelings long. They passed away left tranquil contented.’ ‘And again,’ said Caleb. ‘But, father! Oh good, gentle father, bear me, I wicked!’ said Blind Girl. ‘This sorrow weighs down!’ Her father could choose let his moist eyes overflow; she earnest pathetic, he understand her, yet. ‘Bring her me,’ said Bertha. ‘I cannot hold closed shut within myself. Bring her me, father!’ She knew he hesitated, said, ‘May. Bring May!’ May heard mention her name, coming quietly towards her, touched her arm. The Blind Girl turned immediately, held her hands. ‘Look face, Dear heart, Sweet heart!’ said Bertha. ‘Read beautiful eyes, tell truth written it.’ ‘Dear Bertha, Yes!’ The Blind Girl still, upturning blank sightless face, tears coursing fast, addressed her words: ‘There not, soul, wish thought good, bright May! There not, soul, grateful recollection stronger deep remembrance stored there, many many times when, full pride sight beauty, consideration Blind Bertha, even two children, Bertha much child ever blindness be! Every blessing head! Light upon happy course! Not less, dear May;’ she drew towards her, closer grasp; ‘not less, bird, because, to-day, knowledge His wife wrung heart almost breaking! Father, May, Mary! oh forgive so, sake he done relieve weariness dark life: sake belief me, I call Heaven witness I could wish married wife worthy his goodness!’ While speaking, she released May Fielding’s hands, clasped her garments attitude mingled supplication love. Sinking lower lower down, she proceeded her strange confession, she dropped last feet her friend, hid her blind face folds her dress. ‘Great Power!’ exclaimed her father, smitten one blow truth, ‘have I deceived her her cradle, break her heart last!’ It well Dot, beaming, useful, busy little Dot—for she was, whatever faults she had, however may learn hate her, good time—it well them, I say, she there: would ended, hard tell. But Dot, recovering her self-possession, interposed, May could reply, Caleb say another word. ‘Come, come, dear Bertha! come away me! Give her arm, May. So! How composed she is, see, already; good her mind us,’ said cheery little woman, kissing her upon forehead. ‘Come away, dear Bertha. Come! here is her good father come her; will not you, Caleb? To—be—sure!’ Well, well! she noble little Dot things, must obdurate nature could withstood her influence. When she got poor Caleb his Bertha away, might comfort console other, she knew could, she presently came bouncing back,—the saying is, fresh daisy; I say fresher—to mount guard bridling little piece consequence cap gloves, prevent dear old creature making discoveries. ‘So bring precious Baby, Tilly,’ said she, drawing chair fire; ‘and I lap, here is Mrs. Fielding, Tilly, tell management Babies, put right twenty points I am wrong be. Will not you, Mrs. Fielding?’ Not even Welsh Giant, who, according popular expression, ‘slow’ perform fatal surgical operation upon himself, emulation juggling-trick achieved his arch-enemy breakfast-time; even he fell half readily snare prepared him, old lady artful pitfall. The fact Tackleton walked out; furthermore, two three people talking together distance, two minutes, leaving her her resources; quite enough put her her dignity, bewailment mysterious convulsion Indigo trade, four-and-twenty hours. But becoming deference her experience, part young mother, irresistible, short affectation humility, she began enlighten her best grace world; sitting bolt upright wicked Dot, she did, half hour, deliver infallible domestic recipes precepts, would (if acted on) utterly destroyed done Young Peerybingle, though he Infant Samson. To change theme, Dot little needlework—she carried contents whole workbox her pocket; however she contrived it, I do not know—then little nursing; little needlework; little whispering chat May, old lady dozed; little bits bustle, quite her manner always, found short afternoon. Then, grew dark, solemn part Institution Pic-Nic she perform Bertha’s household tasks, she trimmed fire, swept hearth, set tea-board out, drew curtain, lighted candle. Then she played air two rude kind harp, Caleb contrived Bertha, played well; Nature made her delicate little ear choice one music would jewels, she wear. By time established hour tea; Tackleton came back again, share meal, spend evening. Caleb Bertha returned time before, Caleb sat his afternoon’s work. But he could not settle it, poor fellow, anxious remorseful his daughter. It touching see sitting idle his working-stool, regarding her wistfully, always saying his face, ‘Have I deceived her her cradle, break her heart!’ When night, tea done, Dot nothing washing cups saucers; word—for I must come it, use putting off—when time drew nigh expecting Carrier’s return every sound distant wheels, her manner changed again, her colour came went, she restless. Not good wives are, listening husbands. No, no, no. It another sort restlessness that. Wheels heard. A horse’s feet. The barking dog. The gradual approach sounds. The scratching paw Boxer door! ‘Whose step that!’ cried Bertha, starting up. ‘Whose step?’ returned Carrier, standing portal, his brown face ruddy winter berry keen night air. ‘Why, mine.’ ‘The step,’ said Bertha. ‘The man’s tread behind you!’ ‘She deceived,’ observed Carrier, laughing. ‘Come along, sir. You will welcome, never fear!’ He spoke loud tone; he spoke, deaf old gentleman entered. ‘He is much stranger, have not seen once, Caleb,’ said Carrier. ‘You will give house-room till go?’ ‘Oh surely, John, take honour.’ ‘He is best company earth, talk secrets in,’ said John. ‘I reasonable good lungs, he tries  them, I tell you. Sit down, sir. All friends here, glad see you!’ When he imparted assurance, voice amply corroborated he said his lungs, he added his natural tone, ‘A chair chimney-corner, leave sit quite silent look pleasantly him, he cares for. He is easily pleased.’ Bertha listening intently. She called Caleb her side, he set chair, asked him, low voice, describe visitor. When he done (truly now; scrupulous fidelity), she moved, first time since he come in, sighed, seemed interest concerning him. The Carrier high spirits, good fellow he was, fonder his little wife ever. ‘A clumsy Dot she was, afternoon!’ he said, encircling her his rough arm, she stood, removed rest; ‘and yet I like her somehow. See yonder, Dot!’ He pointed old man. She looked down. I think she trembled. ‘He is—ha ha ha!—he is full admiration you!’ said Carrier. ‘Talked nothing else, whole way here. Why, he is brave old boy. I like it!’ ‘I wish he better subject, John,’ she said, uneasy glance room. At Tackleton especially. ‘A better subject!’ cried jovial John. ‘There is thing. Come, great-coat, thick shawl, heavy wrappers! cosy half-hour fire! My humble service, Mistress. A game cribbage, I? That is hearty. The cards board, Dot. And glass beer here, there is left, small wife!’ His challenge addressed old lady, accepting gracious readiness, soon engaged upon game. At first, Carrier looked sometimes, smile, called Dot peep his shoulder his hand, advise knotty point. But his adversary rigid disciplinarian, subject occasional weakness respect pegging she entitled to, required vigilance his part, left neither eyes ears spare. Thus, his whole attention gradually became absorbed upon cards; he thought nothing else, hand upon his shoulder restored consciousness Tackleton. ‘I sorry disturb you—but word, directly.’ ‘I am going deal,’ returned Carrier. ‘It is crisis.’ ‘It is,’ said Tackleton. ‘Come here, man!’ There his pale face made rise immediately, ask him, hurry, matter was. ‘Hush! John Peerybingle,’ said Tackleton. ‘I sorry this. I indeed. I afraid it. I suspected first.’ ‘What it?’ asked Carrier, frightened aspect. ‘Hush! I will show you, you will come me.’ The Carrier accompanied him, without another word. They went across yard, stars shining, little side-door, Tackleton’s counting-house, glass window, commanding ware-room, closed night. There light counting-house itself, lamps long narrow ware-room; consequently window bright. ‘A moment!’ said Tackleton. ‘Can bear look window, think?’ ‘Why not?’ returned Carrier. ‘A moment more,’ said Tackleton. ‘Do not commit violence. It is use. It is dangerous too. You are strong-made man; might murder know it.’ The Carrier looked face, recoiled step he struck. In one stride he window, he saw— Oh Shadow Hearth! Oh truthful Cricket! Oh perfidious Wife! He saw her, old man—old longer, erect gallant—bearing his hand false white hair his way desolate miserable home. He saw her listening him, he bent his head whisper her ear; suffering clasp her round waist, moved slowly dim wooden gallery towards door entered it. He saw stop, saw her turn—to face, face he loved so, presented his view!—and saw her, her hands, adjust lie upon his head, laughing, she it, his unsuspicious nature! He clenched his strong right hand first, would beaten lion. But opening immediately again, he spread eyes Tackleton (for he tender her, even then), so, passed out, fell upon desk, weak infant. He wrapped chin, busy his horse parcels, she came room, prepared going home. ‘Now, John, dear! Good night, May! Good night, Bertha!’ Could she kiss them? Could she blithe cheerful her parting? Could she venture reveal her face without blush? Yes. Tackleton observed her closely, she this. Tilly hushing Baby, she crossed re-crossed Tackleton, dozen times, repeating drowsily: ‘Did knowledge wifes, then, wring hearts almost breaking; fathers deceive cradles break hearts last!’ ‘Now, Tilly, give Baby! Good night, Mr. Tackleton. Where is John, goodness’ sake?’ ‘He is going walk beside horse’s head,’ said Tackleton; helped her her seat. ‘My dear John. Walk? To-night?’ The muffled figure her husband made hasty sign affirmative; false stranger little nurse places, old horse moved off. Boxer, unconscious Boxer, running before, running back, running round round cart, barking triumphantly merrily ever. When Tackleton gone likewise, escorting May her mother home, poor Caleb sat fire beside his daughter; anxious remorseful core; still saying his wistful contemplation her, ‘Have I deceived her her cradle, break her heart last!’ The toys set motion Baby, stopped, run down, long ago. In faint light silence, imperturbably calm dolls, agitated rocking-horses distended eyes nostrils, old gentlemen street-doors, standing half doubled upon failing knees ankles, wry-faced nut-crackers, Beasts upon way Ark, twos, like Boarding School walking, might imagined stricken motionless fantastic wonder, Dot false, Tackleton beloved, combination circumstances. CHAPTER III—Chirp Third The Dutch clock corner struck Ten, Carrier sat his fireside. So troubled grief-worn, he seemed scare Cuckoo, who, cut his ten melodious announcements short possible, plunged back Moorish Palace again, clapped his little door behind him, unwonted spectacle much his feelings. If little Haymaker armed sharpest scythes, cut every stroke Carrier’s heart, he never could gashed wounded it, Dot done. It heart full love her; bound held together innumerable threads winning remembrance, spun daily working her many qualities endearment; heart she enshrined herself gently closely; heart single earnest Truth, strong right, weak wrong; could cherish neither passion revenge first, room hold broken image Idol. But, slowly, slowly, Carrier sat brooding his hearth, cold dark, fiercer thoughts began rise within him, angry wind comes rising night. The Stranger beneath his outraged roof. Three steps would take his chamber-door. One blow would beat in. ‘You might murder know it,’ Tackleton said. How could murder, he gave villain time grapple hand hand! He younger man. It ill-timed thought, bad dark mood his mind. It angry thought, goading avenging act, change cheerful house haunted place lonely travellers would dread pass night; timid would see shadows struggling ruined windows moon dim, hear wild noises stormy weather. He younger man! Yes, yes; lover heart _he_ never touched. Some lover her early choice, she thought dreamed, she pined pined, he fancied her happy his side. O agony think it! She above-stairs Baby, getting bed. As he sat brooding hearth, she came close beside him, without his knowledge—in turning rack his great misery, he lost sounds—and put her little stool his feet. He knew it, he felt her hand upon his own, saw her looking his face. With wonder? No. It his first impression, he fain look her again, set right. No, wonder. With eager inquiring look; wonder. At first alarmed serious; then, changed strange, wild, dreadful smile recognition his thoughts; then, nothing her clasped hands her brow, her bent head, falling hair. Though power Omnipotence his wield moment, he much diviner property Mercy his breast, turned one feather’s weight her. But he could bear see her crouching upon little seat he often looked her, love pride, innocent gay; and, she rose left him, sobbing she went, he felt relief vacant place beside rather her long-cherished presence. This anguish keener all, reminding desolate he become, great bond his life rent asunder. The he felt this, he knew he could better borne see her lying prematurely dead little child upon her breast, higher stronger rose his wrath his enemy. He looked weapon. There gun, hanging wall. He took down, moved pace two towards door perfidious Stranger’s room. He knew gun loaded. Some shadowy idea shoot man like wild beast, seized him, dilated his mind grew monstrous demon complete possession him, casting milder thoughts setting undivided empire. That phrase wrong. Not casting his milder thoughts, artfully transforming them. Changing scourges drive on. Turning water blood, love hate, gentleness blind ferocity. Her image, sorrowing, humbled, still pleading his tenderness mercy resistless power, never left his mind; but, staying there, urged door; raised weapon his shoulder; fitted nerved his finger trigger; cried ‘Kill him! In his bed!’ He reversed gun beat stock upon door; he already held lifted air; indistinct design his thoughts calling fly, God’s sake, window— When, suddenly, struggling fire illumined whole chimney glow light; Cricket Hearth began Chirp! No sound he could heard, human voice, even hers, could moved softened him. The artless words she told her love Cricket, freshly spoken; her trembling, earnest manner moment, him; her pleasant voice—O voice was, making household music fireside honest man!—thrilled his better nature, awoke life action. He recoiled door, like man walking his sleep, awakened frightful dream; put gun aside. Clasping his hands his face, he sat beside fire, found relief tears. The Cricket Hearth came room, stood Fairy shape him. ‘“I love it,”’ said Fairy Voice, repeating he well remembered, ‘“for many times I heard it, many thoughts harmless music given me.”’ ‘She said so!’ cried Carrier. ‘True!’ ‘“This happy home, John; I love Cricket sake!”’ ‘It been, Heaven knows,’ returned Carrier. ‘She made happy, always,—until now.’ ‘So gracefully sweet-tempered; domestic, joyful, busy, light-hearted!’ said Voice. ‘Otherwise I never could loved her I did,’ returned Carrier. The Voice, correcting him, said ‘do.’ The Carrier repeated ‘as I did.’ But firmly. His faltering tongue resisted his control, would speak way, him. The Figure, attitude invocation, raised hand said: ‘Upon hearth—’ ‘The hearth she blighted,’ interposed Carrier. ‘The hearth she has—how often!—blessed brightened,’ said Cricket; ‘the hearth which, her, stones bricks rusty bars, been, her, Altar Home; nightly sacrificed petty passion, selfishness, care, offered homage tranquil mind, trusting nature, overflowing heart; smoke poor chimney gone upward better fragrance richest incense burnt richest shrines gaudy temples world!—Upon hearth; quiet sanctuary; surrounded gentle influences associations; hear her! Hear me! Hear everything speaks language hearth home!’ ‘And pleads her?’ inquired Carrier. ‘All things speak language hearth home, must plead her!’ returned Cricket. ‘For speak truth.’ And Carrier, his head upon his hands, continued sit meditating his chair, Presence stood beside him, suggesting his reflections power, presenting him, glass picture. It solitary Presence. From hearthstone, chimney, clock, pipe, kettle, cradle; floor, walls, ceiling, stairs; cart without, cupboard within, household implements; every thing every place she ever familiar, she ever entwined one recollection herself her unhappy husband’s mind; Fairies came trooping forth. Not stand beside Cricket did, busy bestir themselves. To honour her image. To pull skirts, point appeared. To cluster round it, embrace it, strew flowers tread on. To try crown fair head tiny hands. To show fond loved it; one ugly, wicked accusatory creature claim knowledge it—none playful approving selves. His thoughts constant her image. It always there. She sat plying her needle, fire, singing herself. Such blithe, thriving, steady little Dot! The fairy figures turned upon once, one consent, one prodigious concentrated stare, seemed say, ‘Is light wife mourning for!’ There sounds gaiety outside, musical instruments, noisy tongues, laughter. A crowd young merry-makers came pouring in, among May Fielding score pretty girls. Dot fairest all; young too. They came summon her join party. It dance. If ever little foot made dancing, was, surely. But she laughed, shook her head, pointed her cookery fire, her table ready spread: exulting defiance rendered her charming she before. And she merrily dismissed them, nodding her would-be partners, one one, passed, comical indifference, enough make go drown immediately her admirers—and must so, less; could not help it. And yet indifference her character. O no! For presently, came certain Carrier door; bless her welcome she bestowed upon him! Again staring figures turned upon once, seemed say, ‘Is wife forsaken you!’ A shadow fell upon mirror picture: call will. A great shadow Stranger, he first stood underneath roof; covering surface, blotting objects. But nimble Fairies worked like bees clear again. And Dot there. Still bright beautiful. Rocking her little Baby cradle, singing softly, resting her head upon shoulder counterpart musing figure Fairy Cricket stood. The night—I mean real night: going Fairy clocks—was wearing now; stage Carrier’s thoughts, moon burst out, shone brightly sky. Perhaps calm quiet light risen also, his mind; he could think soberly happened. Although shadow Stranger fell intervals upon glass—always distinct, big, thoroughly defined—it never fell darkly first. Whenever appeared, Fairies uttered general cry consternation, plied little arms legs, inconceivable activity, rub out. And whenever got Dot again, showed her more, bright beautiful, cheered inspiring manner. They never showed her, otherwise beautiful bright, Household Spirits falsehood annihilation; so, Dot them, one active, beaming, pleasant little creature light sun Carrier’s Home! The Fairies prodigiously excited showed her, Baby, gossiping among knot sage old matrons, affecting wondrous old matronly herself, leaning staid, demure old way upon her husband’s arm, attempting—she! bud little woman—to convey idea abjured vanities world general, sort person novelty mother; yet breath, showed her, laughing Carrier awkward, pulling his shirt-collar make smart, mincing merrily room teach dance! They turned, stared immensely showed her Blind Girl; for, though she carried cheerfulness animation her wheresoever she went, she bore influences Caleb Plummer’s home, heaped running over. The Blind Girl’s love her, trust her, gratitude her; her good busy way setting Bertha’s thanks aside; her dexterous little arts filling moment visit something useful house, really working hard feigning make holiday; her bountiful provision standing delicacies, Veal Ham-Pie bottles Beer; her radiant little face arriving door, taking leave; wonderful expression her whole self, her neat foot crown her head, part establishment—a something necessary it, could not without; Fairies revelled in, loved her for. And looked upon once, appealingly, seemed say, among nestled her dress fondled her, ‘Is wife betrayed confidence!’ More once, twice, thrice, long thoughtful night, showed her sitting her favourite seat, her bent head, her hands clasped her brow, her falling hair. As he seen her last. And found her thus, neither turned looked upon him, gathered close round her, comforted kissed her, pressed one another show sympathy kindness her, forgot altogether. Thus night passed. The moon went down; stars grew pale; cold day broke; sun rose. The Carrier still sat, musing, chimney corner. He sat there, his head upon his hands, night. All night faithful Cricket Chirp, Chirp, Chirping Hearth. All night he listened voice. All night household Fairies busy him. All night she amiable blameless glass, except one shadow fell upon it. He rose broad day, washed dressed himself. He could not go his customary cheerful avocations—he wanted spirit them—but mattered less, Tackleton’s wedding-day, he arranged make his rounds proxy. He thought gone merrily church Dot. But plans end. It wedding-day too. Ah! little he looked close year! The Carrier expected Tackleton would pay early visit; he right. He walked fro his door, many minutes, he saw Toy-merchant coming his chaise along road. As chaise drew nearer, he perceived Tackleton dressed sprucely his marriage, he decorated his horse’s head flowers favours. The horse looked much like bridegroom Tackleton, whose half-closed eye disagreeably expressive ever. But Carrier took little heed this. His thoughts occupation. ‘John Peerybingle!’ said Tackleton, air condolence. ‘My good fellow, find morning?’ ‘I poor night, Master Tackleton,’ returned Carrier, shaking his head: ‘for I good deal disturbed mind. But it is now! Can spare half hour so, private talk?’ ‘I came purpose,’ returned Tackleton, alighting. ‘Never mind horse. He will stand quiet enough, reins post, you will give mouthful hay.’ The Carrier brought his stable, set him, turned house. ‘You married noon,’ he said, ‘I think?’ ‘No,’ answered Tackleton. ‘Plenty time. Plenty time.’ When entered kitchen, Tilly Slowboy rapping Stranger’s door; removed steps. One her red eyes (for Tilly crying night long, her mistress cried) keyhole; she knocking loud; seemed frightened. ‘If please I cannot make nobody hear,’ said Tilly, looking round. ‘I hope nobody an’t gone died please!’ This philanthropic wish, Miss Slowboy emphasised various new raps kicks door; led result whatever. ‘Shall I go?’ said Tackleton. ‘It is curious.’ The Carrier, turned his face door, signed go he would. So Tackleton went Tilly Slowboy’s relief; he kicked knocked; he failed get least reply. But he thought trying handle door; opened easily, he peeped in, looked in, went in, soon came running again. ‘John Peerybingle,’ said Tackleton, his ear. ‘I hope nothing—nothing rash night?’ The Carrier turned upon quickly. ‘Because he is gone!’ said Tackleton; ‘and window’s open. I do not see marks—to sure it is almost level garden: I afraid might some—some scuffle. Eh?’ He nearly shut expressive eye altogether; he looked hard. And he gave his eye, his face, his whole person, sharp twist. As he would screwed truth him. ‘Make easy,’ said Carrier. ‘He went room last night, without harm word deed me, one entered since. He away his free will. I would go gladly door, beg bread house house, life, I could change past he never come. But he come gone. And I done him!’ ‘Oh!—Well, I think he got pretty easy,’ said Tackleton, taking chair. The sneer lost upon Carrier, sat too, shaded his face his hand, little time, proceeding. ‘You showed last night,’ he said length, ‘my wife; wife I love; secretly—’ ‘And tenderly,’ insinuated Tackleton. ‘Conniving man’s disguise, giving opportunities meeting her alone. I think there is sight I would not rather seen that. I think there is man world I would not rather show me.’ ‘I confess suspicions always,’ said Tackleton. ‘And made objectionable here, I know.’ ‘But show me,’ pursued Carrier, minding him; ‘and saw her, wife, wife I love’—his voice, eye, hand, grew steadier firmer he repeated words: evidently pursuance steadfast purpose—‘as saw her disadvantage, right also see eyes, look breast, know mind is, upon subject. For it is settled,’ said Carrier, regarding attentively. ‘And nothing shake now.’ Tackleton muttered general words assent, necessary vindicate something other; he overawed manner his companion. Plain unpolished was, something dignified noble it, nothing soul generous honour dwelling man could imparted. ‘I plain, rough man,’ pursued Carrier, ‘with little recommend me. I clever man, well know. I young man. I loved little Dot, I seen her grow up, child, her father’s house; I knew precious she was; she life, years years. There is many men I cannot compare with, never could loved little Dot like me, I think!’ He paused, softly beat ground short time his foot, resuming. ‘I often thought though I was not good enough her, I make her kind husband, perhaps know her value better another; way I reconciled myself, came think might possible married. And end came about, married.’ ‘Hah!’ said Tackleton, significant shake head. ‘I studied myself; I experience myself; I knew much I loved her, happy I be,’ pursued Carrier. ‘But I not—I feel now—sufficiently considered her.’ ‘To sure,’ said Tackleton. ‘Giddiness, frivolity, fickleness, love admiration! Not considered! All left sight! Hah!’ ‘You best interrupt me,’ said Carrier, sternness, ‘till understand me; you are wide so. If, yesterday, I would struck man blow, dared breathe word her, to-day I would set foot upon his face, he brother!’ The Toy-merchant gazed astonishment. He went softer tone: ‘Did I consider,’ said Carrier, ‘that I took her—at her age, her beauty—from her young companions, many scenes she ornament; she brightest little star ever shone, shut her day day dull house, keep tedious company? Did I consider little suited I her sprightly humour, wearisome plodding man like must be, one her quick spirit? Did I consider merit me, claim me, I loved her, everybody must, knew her? Never. I took advantage her hopeful nature her cheerful disposition; I married her. I wish I never had! For her sake; mine!’ The Toy-merchant gazed him, without winking. Even half-shut eye open now. ‘Heaven bless her!’ said Carrier, ‘for cheerful constancy she tried keep knowledge me! And Heaven help me, that, slow mind, I found before! Poor child! Poor Dot! _I_ find out, seen her eyes fill tears, marriage spoken of! I, seen secret trembling her lips hundred times, never suspected till last night! Poor girl! That I could ever hope she would fond me! That I could ever believe she was!’ ‘She made show it,’ said Tackleton. ‘She made show it, tell truth origin misgivings.’ And he asserted superiority May Fielding, certainly made sort show fond _him_. ‘She tried,’ said poor Carrier, greater emotion he exhibited yet; ‘I begin know hard she tried, dutiful zealous wife. How good she been; much she done; brave strong heart she has; let happiness I known roof bear witness! It help comfort me, I alone.’ ‘Here alone?’ said Tackleton. ‘Oh! Then mean take notice this?’ ‘I mean,’ returned Carrier, ‘to her greatest kindness, make her best reparation, power. I release her daily pain unequal marriage, struggle conceal it. She shall free I render her.’ ‘Make _her_ reparation!’ exclaimed Tackleton, twisting turning his great ears his hands. ‘There must something wrong here. You did not say that, course.’ The Carrier set his grip upon collar Toy-merchant, shook like reed. ‘Listen me!’ he said. ‘And take care hear right. Listen me. Do I speak plainly?’ ‘Very plainly indeed,’ answered Tackleton. ‘As I meant it?’ ‘Very much meant it.’ ‘I sat upon hearth, last night, night,’ exclaimed Carrier. ‘On spot she often sat beside me, her sweet face looking mine. I called her whole life, day day. I her dear self, every passage, review me. And upon soul she innocent, One judge innocent guilty!’ Staunch Cricket Hearth! Loyal household Fairies! ‘Passion distrust left me!’ said Carrier; ‘and nothing grief remains. In unhappy moment old lover, better suited her tastes years I; forsaken, perhaps, me, her will; returned. In unhappy moment, taken surprise, wanting time think she did, she made herself party his treachery, concealing it. Last night she saw him, interview witnessed. It wrong. But otherwise she innocent truth earth!’ ‘If opinion’—Tackleton began. ‘So, let her go!’ pursued Carrier. ‘Go, blessing many happy hours she given me, forgiveness pang she caused me. Let her go, peace mind I wish her! She will never hate me. She will learn like better, I am drag upon her, she wears chain I riveted, lightly. This day I took her, little thought her enjoyment, her home. To-day she shall return it, I trouble her more. Her father mother to-day—we made little plan keeping together—and shall take her home. I trust her, there, anywhere. She leaves without blame, she live I sure. If I die—I may perhaps she still young; I lost courage hours—she will find I remembered her, loved her last! This end showed me. Now, it is over!’ ‘O no, John, over. Do say it is yet! Not quite yet. I heard noble words. I could steal away, pretending ignorant affected deep gratitude. Do say it is over, ‘till clock struck again!’ She entered shortly Tackleton, remained there. She never looked Tackleton, fixed her eyes upon her husband. But she kept away him, setting wide space possible them; though she spoke impassioned earnestness, she went nearer even then. How different her old self! ‘No hand make clock strike hours gone,’ replied Carrier, faint smile. ‘But let so, will, dear. It strike soon. It is little matter say. I would try please harder case that.’ ‘Well!’ muttered Tackleton. ‘I must off, clock strikes again, it will necessary upon way church. Good morning, John Peerybingle. I am sorry deprived pleasure company. Sorry loss, occasion too!’ ‘I spoken plainly?’ said Carrier, accompanying door. ‘Oh quite!’ ‘And you will remember I said?’ ‘Why, compel make observation,’ said Tackleton, previously taking precaution getting his chaise; ‘I must say unexpected, I am far likely forget it.’ ‘The better us both,’ returned Carrier. ‘Good bye. I give joy!’ ‘I wish I could give _you_,’ said Tackleton. ‘As I cannot; thank’ee. Between ourselves, (as I told before, eh?) I do not much think I shall less joy married life, May has not officious me, demonstrative. Good bye! Take care yourself.’ The Carrier stood looking he smaller distance his horse’s flowers favours near hand; then, deep sigh, went strolling like restless, broken man, among neighbouring elms; unwilling return clock eve striking. His little wife, left alone, sobbed piteously; often dried her eyes checked herself, say good he was, excellent he was! twice she laughed; heartily, triumphantly, incoherently (still crying time), Tilly quite horrified. ‘Ow please do not!’ said Tilly. ‘It is enough dead bury Baby, please.’ ‘Will bring sometimes, see his father, Tilly,’ inquired her mistress, drying her eyes; ‘when I cannot live here, gone old home?’ ‘Ow please do not!’ cried Tilly, throwing back her head, bursting howl—she looked moment uncommonly like Boxer. ‘Ow please do not! Ow, everybody gone done everybody, making everybody else wretched! Ow-w-w-w!’ The soft-hearted Slowboy trailed juncture, deplorable howl, tremendous long suppression, she must infallibly awakened Baby, frightened something serious (probably convulsions), her eyes encountered Caleb Plummer, leading his daughter. This spectacle restoring her sense proprieties, she stood moments silent, her mouth wide open; then, posting bed Baby lay asleep, danced weird, Saint Vitus manner floor, time rummaged her face head among bedclothes, apparently deriving much relief extraordinary operations. ‘Mary!’ said Bertha. ‘Not marriage!’ ‘I told her would there, mum,’ whispered Caleb. ‘I heard much last night. But bless you,’ said little man, taking her tenderly hands, ‘I do not care say. I do not believe them. There an’t much me, little torn pieces sooner I would trust word you!’ He put his arms her hugged her, child might hugged one his dolls. ‘Bertha could not stay home morning,’ said Caleb. ‘She afraid, I know, hear bells ring, could not trust herself near wedding-day. So started good time, came here. I thinking I done,’ said Caleb, moment’s pause; ‘I blaming till I hardly knew turn, distress mind I caused her; I have come conclusion I would better, you will stay me, mum, while, tell her truth. You will stay while?’ he inquired, trembling head foot. ‘I do not know effect may upon her; I do not know she will think me; I do not know she will ever care her poor father afterwards. But it is best her she undeceived, I must bear consequences I deserve!’ ‘Mary,’ said Bertha, ‘where hand! Ah! Here is!’ pressing her lips, smile, drawing her arm. ‘I heard speaking softly among themselves, last night, blame you. They wrong.’ The Carrier’s Wife silent. Caleb answered her. ‘They wrong,’ he said. ‘I knew it!’ cried Bertha, proudly. ‘I told so. I scorned hear word! Blame _her_ justice!’ she pressed hand her own, soft cheek her face. ‘No! I blind that.’ Her father went one side her, Dot remained upon other: holding her hand. ‘I know all,’ said Bertha, ‘better think. But none well her. Not even you, father. There nothing half real true me, she is. If I could restored sight instant, word spoken, I could choose her crowd! My sister!’ ‘Bertha, dear!’ said Caleb, ‘I something mind I want tell you, three alone. Hear kindly! I confession make you, darling.’ ‘A confession, father?’ ‘I wandered truth lost myself, child,’ said Caleb, pitiable expression his bewildered face. ‘I wandered truth, intending kind you; cruel.’ She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him, repeated ‘Cruel!’ ‘He accuses strongly, Bertha,’ said Dot. ‘You will say so, presently. You will first tell so.’ ‘He cruel me!’ cried Bertha, smile incredulity. ‘Not meaning it, child,’ said Caleb. ‘But I been; though I never suspected it, till yesterday. My dear blind daughter, hear forgive me! The world live in, heart mine, does not exist I represented it. The eyes trusted in, false you.’ She turned her wonder-stricken face towards still; drew back, clung closer her friend. ‘Your road life rough, poor one,’ said Caleb, ‘and I meant smooth you. I altered objects, changed characters people, invented many things never been, make happier. I concealments you, put deceptions you, God forgive me! surrounded fancies.’ ‘But living people fancies!’ she said hurriedly, turning pale, still retiring him. ‘You cannot change them.’ ‘I done so, Bertha,’ pleaded Caleb. ‘There one person know, dove—’ ‘Oh father! say, I know?’ she answered, term keen reproach. ‘What _I_ know! I leader! I miserably blind.’ In anguish her heart, she stretched her hands, she groping her way; spread them, manner forlorn sad, upon her face. ‘The marriage takes place to-day,’ said Caleb, ‘is stern, sordid, grinding man. A hard master me, dear, many years. Ugly his looks, his nature. Cold callous always. Unlike I painted everything, child. In everything.’ ‘Oh why,’ cried Blind Girl, tortured, seemed, almost beyond endurance, ‘why ever this! Why ever fill heart full, come like Death, tear away objects love! O Heaven, blind I am! How helpless alone!’ Her afflicted father hung his head, offered reply his penitence sorrow. She short time passion regret, Cricket Hearth, unheard her, began chirp. Not merrily, low, faint, sorrowing way. It mournful her tears began flow; Presence beside Carrier night, appeared behind her, pointing her father, fell like rain. She heard Cricket-voice plainly soon, conscious, her blindness, Presence hovering her father. ‘Mary,’ said Blind Girl, ‘tell home is. What truly is.’ ‘It poor place, Bertha; poor bare indeed. The house scarcely keep wind rain another winter. It roughly shielded weather, Bertha,’ Dot continued low, clear voice, ‘as poor father his sack-cloth coat.’ The Blind Girl, greatly agitated, rose, led Carrier’s little wife aside. ‘Those presents I took care of; came almost wish, dearly welcome me,’ she said, trembling; ‘where come from? Did send them?’ ‘No.’ ‘Who then?’ Dot saw she knew, already, silent. The Blind Girl spread her hands her face again. But quite another manner now. ‘Dear Mary, moment. One moment? More way. Speak softly me. You true, I know. You would deceive now; would you?’ ‘No, Bertha, indeed!’ ‘No, I sure would not. You much pity me. Mary, look across room now—to father is—my father, compassionate loving me—and tell see.’ ‘I see,’ said Dot, understood her well, ‘an old man sitting chair, leaning sorrowfully back, his face resting his hand. As his child comfort him, Bertha.’ ‘Yes, yes. She will. Go on.’ ‘He old man, worn care work. He spare, dejected, thoughtful, grey-haired man. I see now, despondent bowed down, striving nothing. But, Bertha, I seen many times before, striving hard many ways one great sacred object. And I honour his grey head, bless him!’ The Blind Girl broke away her; throwing herself upon her knees him, took grey head her breast. ‘It sight restored. It sight!’ she cried. ‘I blind, eyes open. I never knew him! To think I might died, never truly seen father loving me!’ There words Caleb’s emotion. ‘There gallant figure earth,’ exclaimed Blind Girl, holding her embrace, ‘that I would love dearly, would cherish devotedly, this! The greyer, worn, dearer, father! Never let say I blind again. There is furrow his face, there is hair upon his head, shall forgotten prayers thanks Heaven!’ Caleb managed articulate ‘My Bertha!’ ‘And blindness, I believed him,’ said girl, caressing tears exquisite affection, ‘to different! And beside me, day day, mindful me—always, never dreamed this!’ ‘The fresh smart father blue coat, Bertha,’ said poor Caleb. ‘He is gone!’ ‘Nothing gone,’ she answered. ‘Dearest father, no! Everything here—in you. The father I loved well; father I never loved enough, never knew; benefactor I first began reverence love, he sympathy me; All you. Nothing dead me. The soul dear here—here, worn face, grey head. And I NOT blind, father, longer!’ Dot’s whole attention concentrated, discourse, upon father daughter; looking, now, towards little Haymaker Moorish meadow, she saw clock within minutes striking, fell, immediately, nervous excited state. ‘Father,’ said Bertha, hesitating. ‘Mary.’ ‘Yes, dear,’ returned Caleb. ‘Here she is.’ ‘There change _her_. You never told anything _her_ true?’ ‘I done it, dear, I afraid,’ returned Caleb, ‘if I could made her better she was. But I must changed her worse, I changed her all. Nothing could improve her, Bertha.’ Confident Blind Girl she asked question, her delight pride reply her renewed embrace Dot, charming behold. ‘More changes think for, may happen though, dear,’ said Dot. ‘Changes better, I mean; changes great joy us. You must not let startle much, ever happen, affect you? Are wheels upon road? You have quick ear, Bertha. Are wheels?’ ‘Yes. Coming fast.’ ‘I—I—I know quick ear,’ said Dot, placing her hand upon her heart, evidently talking on, fast she could hide palpitating state, ‘because I noticed often, quick find strange step last night. Though said, I well recollect say, Bertha, “Whose step that!” taken greater observation step, I do not know. Though I said now, great changes world: great changes: cannot better prepare surprised hardly anything.’ Caleb wondered meant; perceiving she spoke him, less his daughter. He saw her, astonishment, fluttered distressed she could scarcely breathe; holding chair, save herself falling. ‘They wheels indeed!’ she panted. ‘Coming nearer! Nearer! Very close! And hear stopping garden-gate! And hear step outside door—the step, Bertha, not!—and now!’— She uttered wild cry uncontrollable delight; running Caleb put her hands upon his eyes, young man rushed room, flinging away his hat air, came sweeping upon them. ‘Is over?’ cried Dot. ‘Yes!’ ‘Happily over?’ ‘Yes!’ ‘Do recollect voice, dear Caleb? Did ever hear like before?’ cried Dot. ‘If boy Golden South Americas alive’—said Caleb, trembling. ‘He alive!’ shrieked Dot, removing her hands his eyes, clapping ecstasy; ‘look him! See he stands you, healthy strong! Your dear son! Your dear living, loving brother, Bertha!’ All honour little creature her transports! All honour her tears laughter, three locked one another’s arms! All honour heartiness she met sunburnt sailor-fellow, his dark streaming hair, half-way, never turned her rosy little mouth aside, suffered kiss it, freely, press her his bounding heart! And honour Cuckoo too—why not!—for bursting trap-door Moorish Palace like house-breaker, hiccoughing twelve times assembled company, he got drunk joy! The Carrier, entering, started back. And well he might, find good company. ‘Look, John!’ said Caleb, exultingly, ‘look here! My boy Golden South Americas! My son! Him fitted out, sent away yourself! Him always friend to!’ The Carrier advanced seize hand; but, recoiling, feature his face awakened remembrance Deaf Man Cart, said: ‘Edward! Was you?’ ‘Now tell all!’ cried Dot. ‘Tell all, Edward; do not spare me, nothing shall make spare his eyes, ever again.’ ‘I man,’ said Edward. ‘And could steal, disguised, house old friend?’ rejoined Carrier. ‘There frank boy once—how many years it, Caleb, since heard he dead, proved, thought?—who never would done that.’ ‘There generous friend mine, once; father friend;’ said Edward, ‘who never would judged me, man, unheard. You he. So I certain hear now.’ The Carrier, troubled glance Dot, still kept far away him, replied, ‘Well! that is fair. I will.’ ‘You must know I left here, boy,’ said Edward, ‘I love, love returned. She young girl, perhaps (you may tell me) did not know her mind. But I knew mine, I passion her.’ ‘You had!’ exclaimed Carrier. ‘You!’ ‘Indeed I had,’ returned other. ‘And she returned it. I ever since believed she did, I sure she did.’ ‘Heaven help me!’ said Carrier. ‘This worse all.’ ‘Constant her,’ said Edward, ‘and returning, full hope, many hardships perils, redeem part old contract, I heard, twenty miles away, she false me; she forgotten me; bestowed herself upon another richer man. I mind reproach her; I wished see her, prove beyond dispute true. I hoped she might forced it, her desire recollection. It would small comfort, would some, I thought, I came. That I might truth, real truth; observing freely myself, judging myself, without obstruction one hand, presenting influence (if I any) her, other; I dressed unlike myself—you know how; waited road—you know where. You suspicion me; neither had—had she,’ pointing Dot, ‘until I whispered her ear fireside, she nearly betrayed me.’ ‘But she knew Edward alive, come back,’ sobbed Dot, speaking herself, she burned do, narrative; ‘and she knew his purpose, she advised means keep his secret close; his old friend John Peerybingle much open his nature, clumsy artifice—being clumsy man general,’ said Dot, half laughing half crying—‘to keep him. And she—that is me, John,’ sobbed little woman—‘told all, his sweetheart believed dead; she last over-persuaded her mother marriage silly, dear old thing called advantageous; she—that is again, John—told yet married (though close upon it), would nothing sacrifice went on, love her side; he went nearly mad joy hear it; she—that is again—said she would go them, she often done old times, John, would sound his sweetheart sure she—me again, John—said thought right. And right, John! And brought together, John! And married, John, hour ago! And here is Bride! And Gruff Tackleton may die bachelor! And I am happy little woman, May, God bless you!’ She irresistible little woman, anything purpose; never completely irresistible her present transports. There never congratulations endearing delicious, she lavished herself Bride. Amid tumult emotions his breast, honest Carrier stood, confounded. Flying, now, towards her, Dot stretched her hand stop him, retreated before. ‘No, John, no! Hear all! Do not love more, John, till you have heard every word I say. It wrong secret you, John. I am sorry. I did not think harm, till I came sat little stool last night. But I knew written face, seen walking gallery Edward, I knew thought, I felt giddy wrong was. But oh, dear John, could you, could you, think so!’ Little woman, she sobbed again! John Peerybingle would caught her his arms. But no; she would not let him. ‘Do not love yet, please, John! Not long time yet! When I sad intended marriage, dear, I remembered May Edward young lovers; knew her heart far away Tackleton. You believe that, now. Do not you, John?’ John going make another rush appeal; she stopped again. ‘No; keep there, please, John! When I laugh you, I sometimes do, John, call clumsy dear old goose, names sort, it is I love you, John, well, take pleasure ways, would not see altered least respect made King to-morrow.’ ‘Hooroar!’ said Caleb unusual vigour. ‘My opinion!’ ‘And I speak people middle-aged, steady, John, pretend humdrum couple, going jog-trot sort way, it is I am silly little thing, John, I like, sometimes, act kind Play Baby, that: make believe.’ She saw he coming; stopped again. But she nearly late. ‘No, do not love another minute two, please, John! What I want tell you, I kept last. My dear, good, generous John, talking night Cricket, I lips say, first I love quite dearly I now; I first came home here, I half afraid I might not learn love every bit well I hoped prayed I might—being young, John! But, dear John, every day hour I loved more. And I could loved better I do, noble words I heard say morning, would made me. But I cannot. All affection I (it great deal, John) I gave you, well deserve, long, long ago, I left give. Now, dear husband, take heart again! That is home, John; never, never think sending other!’ You never derive much delight seeing glorious little woman arms third party, would felt seen Dot run Carrier’s embrace. It complete, unmitigated, soul-fraught little piece earnestness ever beheld days. You may sure Carrier state perfect rapture; may sure Dot likewise; may sure were, inclusive Miss Slowboy, wept copiously joy, wishing include her young charge general interchange congratulations, handed round Baby everybody succession, something drink. But, now, sound wheels heard outside door; somebody exclaimed Gruff Tackleton coming back. Speedily worthy gentleman appeared, looking warm flustered. ‘Why, Devil’s this, John Peerybingle!’ said Tackleton. ‘There is mistake. I appointed Mrs. Tackleton meet church, I will swear I passed her road, her way here. Oh! she is! I beg pardon, sir; I have not pleasure knowing you; favour spare young lady, she rather particular engagement morning.’ ‘But I cannot spare her,’ returned Edward. ‘I could not think it.’ ‘What mean, vagabond?’ said Tackleton. ‘I mean, I make allowance vexed,’ returned other, smile, ‘I deaf harsh discourse morning, I discourse last night.’ The look Tackleton bestowed upon him, start he gave! ‘I sorry, sir,’ said Edward, holding May’s left hand, especially third finger; ‘that young lady cannot accompany church; she once, morning, perhaps you will excuse her.’ Tackleton looked hard third finger, took little piece silver-paper, apparently containing ring, his waistcoat-pocket. ‘Miss Slowboy,’ said Tackleton. ‘Will kindness throw fire? Thank’ee.’ ‘It previous engagement, quite old engagement, prevented wife keeping her appointment you, I assure you,’ said Edward. ‘Mr. Tackleton justice acknowledge I revealed faithfully; I told him, many times, I never could forget it,’ said May, blushing. ‘Oh certainly!’ said Tackleton. ‘Oh sure. Oh it is right. It is quite correct. Mrs. Edward Plummer, I infer?’ ‘That is name,’ returned bridegroom. ‘Ah, I should not known you, sir,’ said Tackleton, scrutinising his face narrowly, making low bow. ‘I give joy, sir!’ ‘Thank’ee.’ ‘Mrs. Peerybingle,’ said Tackleton, turning suddenly she stood her husband; ‘I sorry. You have not done great kindness, but, upon life I sorry. You better I thought you. John Peerybingle, I sorry. You understand me; that is enough. It is quite correct, ladies gentlemen all, perfectly satisfactory. Good morning!’ With words he carried off, carried too: merely stopping door, take flowers favours his horse’s head, kick animal once, ribs, means informing screw loose his arrangements. Of course became serious duty now, make day it, mark events high Feast Festival Peerybingle Calendar evermore. Accordingly, Dot went work produce entertainment, reflect undying honour house every one concerned; short space time, she her dimpled elbows flour, whitening Carrier’s coat, every time he came near her, stopping give kiss. That good fellow washed greens, peeled turnips, broke plates, upset iron pots full cold water fire, made useful sorts ways: couple professional assistants, hastily called somewhere neighbourhood, point life death, ran doorways round corners, everybody tumbled Tilly Slowboy Baby, everywhere. Tilly never came force before. Her ubiquity theme general admiration. She stumbling-block passage five-and-twenty minutes past two; man-trap kitchen half-past two precisely; pitfall garret five-and-twenty minutes three. The Baby’s head was, were, test touchstone every description matter,—animal, vegetable, mineral. Nothing use day did not come, time other, close acquaintance it. Then, great Expedition set foot go find Mrs. Fielding; dismally penitent excellent gentlewoman; bring her back, force, needful, happy forgiving. And Expedition first discovered her, she would listen terms all, said, unspeakable number times, ever she lived see day! could not got say anything else, except, ‘Now carry grave:’ seemed absurd, account her dead, anything like it. After time, she lapsed state dreadful calmness, observed, unfortunate train circumstances occurred Indigo Trade, she foreseen she would exposed, her whole life, every species insult contumely; she glad find case; begged would not trouble her,—for she? oh, dear! nobody!—but would forget lived, would take course life without her. From bitterly sarcastic mood, she passed angry one, she gave vent remarkable expression worm would turn trodden on; and, that, she yielded soft regret, said, given her confidence, might she her power suggest! Taking advantage crisis her feelings, Expedition embraced her; she soon her gloves on, her way John Peerybingle’s state unimpeachable gentility; paper parcel her side containing cap state, almost tall, quite stiff, mitre. Then, Dot’s father mother come, another little chaise; behind time; fears entertained; much looking road; Mrs. Fielding always would look wrong morally impossible direction; apprised thereof, hoped she might take liberty looking she pleased. At last came: chubby little couple, jogging along snug comfortable little way quite belonged Dot family; Dot her mother, side side, wonderful see. They like other. Then, Dot’s mother renew her acquaintance May’s mother; May’s mother always stood her gentility; Dot’s mother never stood anything her active little feet. And old Dot—so call Dot’s father, I forgot was not his right name, never mind—took liberties, shook hands first sight, seemed think cap much starch muslin, did not defer Indigo Trade, said help now; and, Mrs. Fielding’s summing up, good-natured kind man—but coarse, dear. I would not missed Dot, honours her wedding-gown, benison her bright face! money. No! good Carrier, jovial ruddy, bottom table. Nor brown, fresh sailor-fellow, his handsome wife. Nor one among them. To missed dinner would miss jolly stout meal man need eat; missed overflowing cups drank The Wedding-Day, would greatest miss all. After dinner, Caleb sang song Sparkling Bowl. As I am living man, hoping keep so, year two, he sang through. And, by-the-by, unlooked-for incident occurred, he finished last verse. There tap door; man came staggering in, without saying leave, leave, something heavy his head. Setting middle table, symmetrically centre nuts apples, he said: ‘Mr. Tackleton’s compliments, he has not got use cake himself, p’raps you will eat it.’ And words, he walked off. There surprise among company, may imagine. Mrs. Fielding, lady infinite discernment, suggested cake poisoned, related narrative cake, which, within her knowledge, turned seminary young ladies, blue. But she overruled acclamation; cake cut May, much ceremony rejoicing. I do not think one tasted it, came another tap door, man appeared again, his arm vast brown-paper parcel. ‘Mr. Tackleton’s compliments, he is sent toys Babby. They are not ugly.’ After delivery expressions, he retired again. The whole party would experienced great difficulty finding words astonishment, even ample time seek them. But none all; messenger scarcely shut door behind him, came another tap, Tackleton walked in. ‘Mrs. Peerybingle!’ said Toy-merchant, hat hand. ‘I am sorry. I am sorry I morning. I time think it. John Peerybingle! I am sour disposition; I cannot help sweetened, less, coming face face man you. Caleb! This unconscious little nurse gave broken hint last night, I found thread. I blush think easily I might bound daughter me, miserable idiot I was, I took her one! Friends, one all, house lonely to-night. I much Cricket Hearth. I scared away. Be gracious me; let join happy party!’ He home five minutes. You never saw fellow. What _had_ he his life, never known, before, his great capacity jovial! Or Fairies him, effected change! ‘John! will not send home evening; you?’ whispered Dot. He near though! There wanted one living creature make party complete; and, twinkling eye, he was, thirsty hard running, engaged hopeless endeavours squeeze his head narrow pitcher. He gone cart journey’s end, much disgusted absence his master, stupendously rebellious Deputy. After lingering stable little time, vainly attempting incite old horse mutinous act returning his account, he walked tap-room laid fire. But suddenly yielding conviction Deputy humbug, must abandoned, he got again, turned tail, come home. There dance evening. With general mention recreation, I left alone, I reason suppose quite original dance, one uncommon figure. It formed odd way; way. Edward, sailor-fellow—a good free dashing sort fellow he was—had telling various marvels concerning parrots, mines, Mexicans, gold dust, he took his head jump his seat propose dance; Bertha’s harp there, she hand upon seldom hear. Dot (sly little piece affectation she chose) said her dancing days over; _I_ think Carrier smoking his pipe, she liked sitting him, best. Mrs. Fielding choice, course, say _her_ dancing days over, that; everybody said same, except May; May ready. So, May Edward got up, amid great applause, dance alone; Bertha plays her liveliest tune. Well! you will believe me, dancing five minutes, suddenly Carrier flings his pipe away, takes Dot round waist, dashes room, starts her, toe heel, quite wonderfully. Tackleton sooner sees this, he skims across Mrs. Fielding, takes her round waist, follows suit. Old Dot sooner sees this, he is, alive, whisks Mrs. Dot middle dance, foremost there. Caleb sooner sees this, he clutches Tilly Slowboy hands goes score; Miss Slowboy, firm belief diving hotly among couples, effecting number concussions them, principle footing it. Hark! Cricket joins music Chirp, Chirp, Chirp; kettle hums! * * * * * But this! Even I listen them, blithely, turn towards Dot, one last glimpse little figure pleasant me, she rest vanished air, I left alone. A Cricket sings upon Hearth; broken child’s-toy lies upon ground; nothing else remains.
