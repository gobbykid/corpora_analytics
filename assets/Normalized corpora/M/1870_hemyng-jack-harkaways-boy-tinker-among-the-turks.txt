The matter ended here, however. When got board, serious reception awaiting them. Their project discovered betrayed skipper officious noodle, Captain Willis little alarmed. The consequences might serious. So captain Jack Harry Girdwood up, gave word two sort. "We wish preserve friendly relations people here, Mr. Harkaway," said he, severely; "and sort adventure calculated achieve object." Jack attempt deny occurred. "We done harm," he said; "we simply cruising saw murder done. We arrived late prevent it, Tinker pleased take upon avenge murdered woman, woman was, could tell her shrieks sack went stifled ever." The captain somewhat startled this. "Is true?" "I would know, captain, I habit saying true." The captain bowed stiffly young Jack's rebuke. "I do not wish imply anything else," he said; "but get high stirrups, young gentleman, remember I command here. Remember thirst excitement, act way likely compromise well everybody board. You wanting proper appreciation right wrong. Before add anything worse present discussion, reflect. The injured air pleased assume place. I leave reflections, young gentleman." And saying, captain turned away left him. Jack's first impulse walk captain, fire parting shot. But Harry Girdwood's hand arrested him. "Do not foolish, Jack," said he. "Let go, I----" "Do not foolish, I say, Jack," persisted Harry Girdwood. "Do know saying?" "Are siding me?" exclaimed Jack. "In general sense I you, I cannot approve replies. You right retort, I should not true pal, Jack, I spoke face convictions." Jack sulked little time. And he captain advised. He reflected. He soon led back correct train thought, lad high moral courage, well physically brave, he afraid acknowledge he wrong. Harry Girdwood walked little way off. Young Jack--dare-devil Jack--coloured he walked Harry held his hand. "Tip us fin, messmate," he said, forced gaiety. "You right, I wrong, course." He turned off. "Where going?" demanded Harry. "To captain." "What for?" "To apologise insolent." Off he went. "Captain Willis." "Do want me, Mr. Harkaway?" asked captain. "The chief mate standing by, Jack feel he far offended expiate his fault public. "When disengaged, Captain Willis, I would beg favour half word you." "Is urgent, Mr. Harkaway?" he asked. "I refractory, Captain Willis." A faint smile stole captain's face spite his endeavour repress it. "I see presently," he said mate. "Come quarter hour so." "Yes, sir," said mate. "Now, Mr. Harkaway, I am service," said Captain Willis, walking forward. Jack grew rather red face this. Then he made plunge, blurted out. "I idiot, Captain Willis, I want know I thoroughly appreciate fairness high sense justice." "Now flattering me, Mr. Harkaway," said captain. "Captain Willis," said impetuous Jack, "if call Mr. Harkaway, I shall think stiff-backed bear malice." "What wild fellow are," said captain. "Why, earth shall I call you?" "Jack, sir," returned hero. "John Sunday holidays, prefer it, proof do not bear ill feeling madman, good luck lucid interval, apologise heartily I now." The captain held his hand. Jack dropped his spank, grasped warmly. "Do not say subject, Mr.--I mean, Jack," said captain, smiling, "or make quite uncomfortable." And matter ended. Jack could dull long together. He plucked his old vivacity, went Mr. Figgins' cabin. "I must go give orphan turn," said he. CHAPTER LX. TURKISH CUSTOMS--JACK GIVES THE ORPHAN A NOTION OF WHAT HE MAY EXPECT--MATRIMONIAL WEAKNESSES--PASHA BLUEBEARD--THE SORT OF A MAN HE IS--HIS EXCELLENCY'S VISIT--MR. FIGGINS IS SPECIALLY INVITED--HOPES AND FEARS. Jack found Mr. Figgins his cabin, squatting cushion cross-legged. Tinker Bogey attending upon him. Since desperate dive sea, adventure shark, two darkeys orphan become fast friends. "Hullo, Mr. Figgins," said Jack, surprise, "what is going forward now?" "Only practising Turkish manners customs," returned Mr. Figgins, quite seriously. "I mean go ashore to-morrow, make acquaintances; I should not like appear quite strange I got ashore. When Rome----" "You must Romans do," added young Jack. "Yes; Turkey," said orphan, "you must----" "Do Turkeys do," concluded Jack. "Precisely," added orphan. "That is it." "You practising smoke long hookah begin with." "Yes--no--it is chibouk," said Mr. Figgins. "That know, I believe, make thoroughly well received Turkish polite society." "Every thing," responded Jack, "with hook--ah." "I did not feel comfortable first," said orphan, "but I am getting now." "There is one danger exposed going ashore." "What is that?" "Any gentleman slightest pretensions good looks nearly always obliged get married times." Mr. Figgins stared aghast this. "A times?" "Yes." "But I am orphan." "No matter; it is fact, sir, I assure you," said Jack, gravely. Mr. Figgins looked exceedingly alarmed. "If I could believe thing joking, Mr. Jack, I precious uncomfortable." "Why?" "Because experience matrimony thing pleasant already," responded orphan. "You married, then?" said Jack, surprise. "Once." "Very moderate that, sir," said Jack. "You widower, I suppose, then?" "I suppose so." "You sure?" "Not quite." "Ah, well, then, will not bad might." "What will not?" "Marriage." "I beg pardon, Mr. Jack," exclaimed orphan; "my experience happy state thing agreeable one wife. Goodness knows long I survive I had, say, several wives." "Do not worry yourself, Mr. Figgins," said Jack, "but well prepared." "For what?" "An emergency. You do not know might happen country." Mr. Figgins looked really anxious this. "I do not well see marry man." "That is question, Mr. Figgins. You could refuse. It would cost life certainty." The orphan nearly rolled his cushion. "What!" "Fact, I assure you," said Jack, gravely. "Explain." "You expected pay visit state pasha." "Yes." "That greatest honour landing stranger." "What pasha?" "The governor province, regular Bung." "Well." "Bluebeard pasha, remember." "No, no," interrupted orphan, delighted show his historical accuracy. "Bluebeard bashaw." "It thing, another way writing pronouncing identical dignity rank. Well, know polygamy pet vice followers Islam." "Oh, it is dreadful, Jack." "The greater man, greater polygamist. A pasha many wives he keep, too. The pasha province rich his rank, his matrimonial proclivities." "Lor'!" "How many wives suppose he has?" asked Jack, air deep gravity. "Do not know," replied orphan, quietly. "Ninety-eight living." Mr. Figgins jumped dropped his chibouk. "Never." "A fact," asserted Jack, gravity. "Why, man must regular Bluebeard." "You have hit it, sir," responded Jack; "that is sort man he is." "Well, well Turks old sinners pashas, I Englishman." "This way likely done," continued Jack. "On presentation his excellency pasha, expected make present. The pasha makes return visit ceremony, leaves behind solid evidence his liberality." "Well?" "Well, highest compliment pasha pay leave one his wives. He generally makes old stock-keeper, something good thirty years seraglio." Mr. Figgins took liveliest interest narrative. He growing rapidly convinced truth Jack's descriptions singular manners customs country were. Yet he eyed Jack one lingering doubt. "Ahem!" said Mr. Figgins, "I do not think I shall join visit ashore morning." "We will see morning," said Jack; "it is pity put trip sake trifling danger wife given you." "It is use," said Mr. Figgins, "my mind fully made up; I shall visit pasha." "It taken grave insult go ashore without paying respects his excellency." "I cannot help that," returned orphan, resolutely; "I will not visit him." "Mr. Figgins," said Jack, voice deep solemnity, "these Turks cruel, vindictive, revengeful. The last Englishman refused was, order pasha, skinned alive, placed sunny side wall, blown death flies." "Surely Turks barbarians," said Mr. Figgins. "You will find are. They would think polishing killing fly." If rascal Jack intended make poor Mr. Figgins uneasy, he certainly succeeded well. Mr. Figgins looked supremely miserable. "Good night, Mr. Figgins. Think over." "I tell I----" "Never mind, do not decide rashly. Pleasant dreams." "Pleasant dreams," said orphan. "I shall nightmare." The orphan's pillow haunted night visions terrible nature. He fancied presence turbaned Turk, powerful pasha, sitting cross-legged ottoman, smoking pipe, endless length, holding his hand drawn sword--a scimitar looked ready chop his head off. Beside terrible Turk stood five ladies, baggy trousers, long veils. No words spoken, instinctively orphan knew he decide scimitar quintet wives--wall-flowers pasha's harem. Silently, mute horror, orphan submit least two evils, choose wife. Then he awoke suddenly. What immense relief find dream all. "I do not quite believe young Harkaway," said orphan, dubiously; "he dreadful practical joker. But I will not go shore, nevertheless. It is interesting see savages, all; really nothing savages." And long tedious time spent endeavouring get sleep again, he dropped off. But dream getting much married. * * * * He slept far morning, his dreams disturbed much, he tired out. When he awoke, someone knocking his cabin door. "Come in." "It is me, Mr. Figgins," said familiar voice. "Come in, captain." Captain Deering entered. "Not yet, Mr. Figgins?" he said, surprise. "We have got visitors aboard already." "Dear me." "Distinguished visitors. The pasha his suite." "You do not say so?" exclaimed orphan, sitting up. "Fact, sir," returned captain. "It must ten years since I last honour interview his excellency." "You know him, then, Captain Deering?" "Rather. Been often. Know every inch country," said captain. "What sort man pasha?" said orphan, thinking Jack's statement. "Oh, decent fellow enough, unless he is riled," reply. "Do speak language?" said orphan. "Like native." "Is he much married say?" demanded Mr. Figgins. The captain smiled. "His excellency weakness way; but," he added, warning voice, "you must make allusion that." "I will not see him," said Mr. Figgins. "I do not intend visit him." "But I come fetch pay respects." "Where?" "Here, board, state saloon." "But----" "Make haste, Mr. Figgins," interrupted Captain Deering. "It joke make pasha wait. Look alive. I will come fetch five minutes. Up get." And Captain Deering departed. Mr. Figgins sorely perplexed now. But he arose began dress quickly possible. "After all," he said himself, "it well. I certainly like see pasha, bit luck, there is danger rate, young Harkaway said true." He went cabin door shouted Tinker. "Tinker!" "He is engaged," answered Captain Deering, close by. "I want him." "He is away, attending his excellency saloon," returned Captain Deering. "Bogey then." "Bogey's too." "Never mind." "Are nearly ready?" "Yes" "Look sharp. I would not his excellency put temper world; would sure result bowstringing his poor devils slaves he got ashore again, would not care conscience." Mr. Figgins hurriedly completed his toilet. "What fiend wretched old bigamist must be," he said himself. "I am precious glad young Harkaway warned me, all. I might got trouble I gone ashore without knowing this." "Stop," said captain. "Have thing take his excellency present?" This made orphan feel somewhat nervous. It tended confirm young Jack said. "It is, then, custom make presents?" he said. "Yes." "What shall I give?" "Any thing. That is nice watch wear." "Must I give that?" "Yes. His excellency sure present much richer one--that is Turkish etiquette." This corroborated Jack's words. Yet far pleasant way putting Jack thought fit do. Mr. Figgins objected present wives. Any thing rich way jewellery quite another matter. "On entering presence, prostrate three times; third time work touch his excellency's toe lips." "I hope his excellency's boots clean." "His excellency would insult letting kiss his boot. No boot stocking he wear." Mr. Figgins made awfully wry face this. "Ugh! I do not like idea kissing naked toe." "You will soon get used it," said captain, cheerfully, "when you have kissed many pashas' toes I have. Hold tongue--here are." He pushed open saloon door ushered Mr. Figgins presence his excellency. CHAPTER LXI. MORE ABOUT CHIVEY AND HIS MASTER--THE FATAL PIT--IS IT THE END?--ARTFUL CHIVEY AND THE ARTFULLER NOTARY--DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND--HOW THE TIGER PREPARED TO SPRING--HERBERT MURRAY IN DANGER. Before proceed describe orphan's presentation arch polygamist, Turkish pasha, remarkable result interview, must look around see neglecting characters whose eventful careers undertaken chronicle. We losing sight one least, decided claim upon attention. This person none Herbert Murray. The reader forgotten circumstances parted company unscrupulous son unscrupulous father. Goaded desperation his villainous servant, Herbert Murray turned upon traitor hurled gravel pit. Then assassin walked away scene. But ere he got far, his steps arrested sound groan. A groan came gravel pit. "Was fancy?" No. Surely not. There again. A low moan--a wail anguish. Back he went, muttering himself-- "Not dead?" He went round nearly bottom pit, peered over. There Chivey leaning upon his elbow groaning severity his bruises, dreadful shock he received. "You have done me, now," he moaned, he caught sight his master. "No; I shall," retorted assassin. And he took deliberate aim pistol. "I expected this," said Chivey, faintly; "but remember murder hanging matter." "I shall escape," retorted Murray, coldly. "But cannot," said Chivey, grin triumph, even he groaned. There something his manner made Murray uneasy. "Twenty-four hours I am missing," gasped Chivey, "your forgery hands police; get back forgery, you are dock Old Bailey, before, stand trial forgery, clue murder." His words caused Murray singular thrill. "What mean that, traitor?" he demanded. "Mean? Why, I know well trust you. I tell I taken every possible precaution," retorted Chivey, "so safe I live. I know man well take every precaution. Now," he added, sinking back exhausted, "now, young sweet pleasant, fire away." Murray paused, concealed his pistol. Was true precautions? Chivey vindictive he cunning. He shown every action. "Supposing I spare you?" said Murray. "You cannot," retorted tiger; "I am done for." "So much better." "So say now," returned Chivey, his voice growing fainter fainter. "Wait remember words--I will revenged." He gasped breath. Then still. Was he dead? Murray trembled fear thought. The words revengeful tiger rang his ear. And he strode away. Silent moody befits one bearing brand Cain. * * * * Chivey far badly hurt he first appeared. He bones broken, his worst injuries bruises unpleasant shaking. But Chivey artful. He thought best keep quiet Herbert Murray gone. Chivey struggled his knees. Then he began crawl along sand pit. Progress difficult first. But he persevered got along time. "If bruises would let think act," he muttered himself, groaning, he crawled back town. "Señor Velasquez," he said himself, happy thought crossed him. "Señor Velasquez man million." He paused think ways means, cunning smile deepened his face, he gradually made his mind. "The worst I must confederate," muttered young schemer. "No matter, one way it, I must make best it." Señor Velasquez obscure notary. Chivey made chatting acquaintance notary town, Spaniard speaking English tolerable proficiency. "What nature secret hold _in terrorem_ master?" demanded notary, Chivey length reached his office. Chivey smiled. "I said secret, Mr. Velasquez," he answered. "But seek advice that," notary made reply, "I must know particulars case." "Oh, no." "Oh, yes." "Why?" "How I advise keep dark?" Chivey leered Spanish notary grinned. "Do not try come old soldier me, please," he said. "Old soldier?" said Señor Velasquez, surprise. "Yes." "What 'old soldier?' What mean that?" "I mean, sir, artful." "Is English?" exclaimed notary. "Rather." "Well, I confess I understand it." "Then," said Chivey, getting quite cheerful he warmed matter, "I think English education seriously neglected, that is I think." "Possibly," said Spaniard. "I learnt tongue student, well grounded slang." "More's pity." There spice contempt Chivey's tone appeared rather aggravate Señor Velasquez. "You clever, Mr. Chivey," said he, "far clever. Now want keep secret, I shall guess secret concerns----" He paused. "Who?" asked Chivey. "The young man whose letters employed intercept." The tiger looked alarmed. "I mean young Señor Jack Harkaway." Chivey looked rather anxiously. "Do not imprudent, Señor Velasquez," he said. "You precious dangerous party thing with." "Not I," returned Señor Velasquez; "I easily dealt with. But would deal must cunning." "You do not find nothing sort me," said Chivey. "What require me?" demanded notary, getting vexed. "He is proud old cove," thought tiger. So he drew his horns met notary half way. "You right, Mr. Velasquez," he remarked. "It concern Jack Harkaway." "I knew that." "Now I want give promise tell I going say you, make use without express permission." "I promise. Now proceed, I pressed time." "I will," said tiger, resolutely. The notary produced paper writing materials. "My master, Mr. Murray, attempted life," began Chivey, "and I possessed certain secrets." "I see." "He present moment idea he killed me. Now I want is, make thoroughly understand he get his difficulty getting way, manner means all." "I see." "How it?" "I go see him." Chivey jumped idea immediately. "Yes, sir, that is sort; there is letters tell tales us." "None." "Get one him, though, can," said Chivey, eagerly; "something compromising yet deeper, like." "I it," said Señor Velasquez. "And pay it? Give price." "Thirty pounds," returned Chivey, feverish state anxiety. "I will it," returned notary, great coolness. CHAPTER LXII. HOW SEÑOR VELASQUEZ PLAYED A DEEP GAME WITH CHIVEY--DOUBLE DEALING--HERBERT MURRAY'S CHANCE--"HARKAWAY MUST BE PUT AWAY"--A GUILTY COMPACT--CHIVEY IN DURANCE VILE--THE SICK ROOM AND THE OPIATE--AN OVERDOSE--THE NOTARY'S GUARDIAN--THE SPANISH GAROTTE--"TALKING IN YOUR SLEEP IS A VERY BAD GAME." Señor Velasquez thing fool. Chivey soft, he competent cope keen spirit Spanish notary. Señor Velasquez walked hotel Herbert Murray staying, first person he chanced meet Murray himself. "I wish word private, Señor Murray," said notary. Murray looked anxiously around him, starting "like guilty thing upon fearful summons." The bland smile Spanish notary reassured him, however. "What I Señor Velasquez?" he asked. "I begged words private," answered Velasquez. "Take seat, Señor Velasquez," said Herbert Murray, "and tell I serve you," entering his room. The notary made comfortable his chair. "I speak safety now?" he said. "Of course." "No fear interruption here?" The notary looked Murray steadily eyes he said-- "I thinking officious servant." Herbert Murray changed colour he faltered-- "Of whom?" "Chivey, I think call him--your groom, I mean." "There fear now," said Murray, averted eyes; "not least world." Señor Velasquez smiled significantly. "Your man Chivey," resumed Spanish notary, "has confided secret." "Concerning me?" "Yes." "The villain!" "Now listen me, Señor Murray. You behaved imprudently indeed. Your whole secret me." Herbert started. "With you?" "Yes." Herbert Murray glanced anxiously door. The notary followed his eyes inward anxiety, yet he betray his uneasiness all. "He speaking truth once, then," said Murray. "He confided his secrets someone else." "Yes." Herbert Murray walked round room, took his position his back door. "Señor Velasquez," he said, low determined voice, "you made unfortunate admission. If witness, one; witness, life danger." The notary certainly felt uncomfortable, he old stager display it. Herbert Murray produced pistol, he proceeded examine cock deliberately. "That would advance purpose much, Señor Murray," he said, coolly; "the noise would bring house trooping room." Murray quite calm collected now, therefore he open reason. "There something that," he said, "so I quieter helpmate here." He uncocked pistol put his breast pocket. Then he whipped long Spanish stiletto. "There reasons using that." "And are?" "Here one," returned notary, drawing long, slender blade his sleeve. Murray palpably disconcerted this. The Spanish notary young Englishman stood facing silence considerable time. The former first break silence. "Now, look here, Señor Murray," said he, "I child, I, knowing I know, come unprepared every emergency--aye, even violence." "Go on," said Murray, his set teeth. "You imprudently placed hands unscrupulous young man." "I have." "And he proved utterly unworthy?" "Utterly." "All known me," said notary, craftily. "Now must pay heed Chivey." "I not," returned Herbert Murray, significantly, "though little fear molestation him, señor." Young Murray little dreamt notary's peculiar smile. "Your sole danger, I take it, Señor Murray, fellow countryman, Jack Harkaway." "Yes." "Then must direct attention. Where he?" "Gone." "Where to?" "Do not know." "I then," returned notary, quietly: "and tell I here. I necessary information; must follow him." "Why?" "To make sure him," coldly replied Spaniard. "How?" Velasquez spoke not. But his meaning clear he put words. A vicious dig his stiletto air. Nothing more. And began understand other. * * * * Señor Velasquez, notary, playing double game. From Herbert Murray he carefully kept knowledge Chivey still lived. And why? That knowledge would lessened his hold. The cunning way he let Herbert Murray understand he knew all, even attempt upon Chivey's life gravel pits, completed mastery he meant hold young rascal. He arranged everything young Murray. He discovered destination ship Jack Harkaway his friends escaped, he procured berth vessel sailing direction. "Once get within arm's length young Harkaway," he said; "you must firm let blow sure." "I will," returned his pupil. "Once Harkaway removed path, may sleep peace, he alone punish forgery." "I hope so." "I know it," said Velasquez. So well notary's plans laid, luckily fortune play his hands, forty-eight hours his interview Murray, he young gentleman safely board ship outward bound. Now Herbert Murray passed one night fearful scene gravel pit, remembrance haunted his pillow moment he went bed moment he arose unrefreshed full fever. And yet he setting intention securing his future peace immunity peril commission fresh crime. The ship setting sail little daybreak, arranged Señor Velasquez come see off. But much his surprise, notary put appearance. Eagerly he waited ship start, lest thing occur eleventh hour, he find laid heels answer his crimes. * * * * Chivey supposed hiding. In reality he prisoner house Señor Velasquez, he knew it. The notary old man, he suffered sundry ailments belong age--notably rheumatism. An acute attack prostrated old man, held he anxious doing. And night Herbert Murray set sail, he lay groaning moaning racking pains. His cries reached Chivey, lay next room, he came sick man's door ask he could assistance. He peered warily in. In spite his groans anguish, old notary insensible influence opiate. Chivey crept in. On low table beside bed lamp flickering fearfully, glass containing medicine. Beside glass phial labelled laudanum. Something possessed intruder empty contents phial glass, he done so, sufferer opened his eyes. "Who is there?" "It is me, Señor Velasquez," said tiger. "You ill----" "What here?" demanded notary, sharply. "You called out. I thought I might assistance." "No, no." "Then I go, señor," said Chivey, "for I tired." "Stay, give physic go." Chivey handed glass. The sick man gulped down, made wry face. "How bitter tastes," he said, shudder. "Good-night, señor." "Good-night." * * * * Chivey remain long absent. The heavy breathing notary soon told safe return room. The business morrow filled mind old Spaniard, he talking his sleep. "At hour daybreak, I tell you, Murray," he muttered. "The berth paid for, paid gold. You follow track enemy Harkaway, within reach, give sharp, sure stroke, free enemy, seeing already taken good care traitor servant." Chivey amazed, electrified. Did he hear aright? "At daybreak!" he exclaimed, aloud. "Yes; daybreak," returned notary his sleep. After pause, sleeper muttered-- "What say you? If Chivey quite dead? What that? How could he follow you? He funds. The money he possessed I strong box bed." Chivey staggered. "Is Murray going bolt, leave power old villain, I wonder," he muttered. He broke his speculations, notary babbling something again. "'The Mogador,'" muttered old man, speaking thickly opiate began make felt; "the captain called Gonzales. You mention name Señor Velasquez, he treat well. He knows me." He muttered words grew incoherent instant. Then he lay back motionless log. The opium held fast power. "Now box," exclaimed tiger, excitedly. Chivey tore open box, lifting musty old deeds parchments, he feasted his eyes upon mine wealth. A pile gold. Bright glittering pieces every size country. And beside thick bundles paper money. "Gold uncommonly pretty," said tiger, "but notes packs closest." Bundle bundle he stowed away his person, regularly padding his chest his shirt. "Now trifle loose cash," he said, coolly. So saying, he dropped sixty seventy gold pieces his breeches pocket. His waistcoat pockets he stuffed full also. Then he pushed back box place bed. "The old man still sleeps," he said himself, looking round bed. He rare good humour himself. "Ha, ha! I rich now," said Chivey. "Thank you, old señor, done good turn. May sleep long." He gave final glance made off. * * * * A distant church clock tolled hour midnight he gained seashore. He luck. Not soul he encounter he reached beach, he came upon two sailors, launching rowing boat. "'Mogador?'" he said, tone inquiry. "_Si_, señor." "That is sort," said Chivey. "I want see Captain Gonzales." "Come us, then," said one sailors. "Rather," responded tiger; "off dive; whip  them up, tickle flank, we are common canter." The sailors understood little English. In little time standing deck "Mogador." And facing Chivey he scrambled side, master ship, Captain Gonzales, Chivey presented one sailors. "Señor Velasquez sent you, captain," said ever ready tiger. "Then welcome." "He told give that," said Chivey, handing captain pair banknotes; "and beg give best accommodation cabin myself." "It shall done." "And let Mr. Murray know presence board he comes." "Good." "I going important business Señor Velasquez, captain," pursued Chivey, infinite assurance; "as may judge, he values care one hundred crowns paid next visit here." "Rely upon uttermost assistance." "Thank you," said Chivey, patronising smile; "and I will obliged show berth." "Here," cried Spanish captain. "Pedro--Juan--Lopez. Take gentleman private cabin." The "Mogador" stood sea bravely enough. Chivey there. Herbert Murray there. But latter little suspected presence former. Herbert Murray, fancied security, reclining deck upon cushions he got below, smoking lazily, looking blue sky overhead, Chivey, looking vainly appropriate cue make his reappearance, slipped suddenly forward, touching his hat, remarked coolest manner world-- "Did ring me, sir?" Herbert looked he seen ghost. "Chivey!" "Guv'ner." Herbert Murray stared his villainous servant. But villainous Chivey was, Herbert Murray never thought bit that. His heart leaped his mouth, he overjoyed find there. "Oh, Chivey, vagabond!" he ejaculated. "I am awfully glad see you." "One touch nature makes whole world kin." There is lot truth trite homely old saying. For one little phrase guilty Herbert come straight heart even villainous tiger touched immediately. "Look here, guv'nor," said Mr. Chivey, "I do not think half bad I thought. My opinion half bad  them, ugly job gravel pits provoking. I bear malice." "You do not!" exclaimed his master, quite overjoyed. "Not bit." "Shake hands." Chivey obeyed. And faster friends ever that. But Señor Velasquez? What compacts villain? For time use plotter, whose plans had, present time, failed. CHAPTER LXIII. THE ORPHAN IS PRESENTED AT COURT--IS A BIT NERVOUS--LESSONS IN THE TURKISH LANGUAGE--MANNERS AND CUSTOMS--THE PASHA OF MANY WIVES--AN OFFICIAL PRESENT--BOWSTRINGING--AN EXECUTION--HORROR! THE ORPHAN'S PERIL, AND WHAT CAME OF IT. Having got Chivey his master together again, travel Turkish coast company young Jack his friends. The orphan roused his slumbers presented pasha province. His excellency pasha done honour pay visit ceremony board ship, seated great state surrounded his suite best saloon. After chief personages board presented, his excellency had, according Captain Deering, desired see distinguished personage, Mr. Figgins, _alias_ orphan. And orphan stood trembling outside door saloon. "In go, Mr. Figgins," whispered Captain Deering. "One moment." "Nonsense." "Just word." "Bah!" said captain, grin; "you are not going tooth out. In you." He opened door, gave timorous orphan vigorous drive behind, Mr. Figgins stood august presence. The pasha seated--it would irreverent say squatted, would better express it--upon cushion was, Paddy says, hanging floor. His excellency peculiar, say painful attitude, less agile mortals find unattainable, appears mean true rest Turk tailor. The pasha rejoiced beard enormous dimensions, grizzled dirt-coloured beard almost touched cushion upon he sat. A turban red gold silk upon his venerable head. And beside his excellency upon cushion laid his arms, weapons barbarous make, thought orphan. A scimitar, curved _à la_ Saladin, two long-barrelled pistols, jewelled butts, "as though earrings bracelets," orphan said himself, long dagger ivory hilt sheath, piece cord. "That is tie together with," mentally decided orphan. "One might well travel Woolwich Arsenal armoury Tower. Barbarous old beast." "Now," said Captain Deering, "tuck tuppenny, Mr. Figgins; bow low can." The orphan put his back angle forty-five his legs. "Lower." "Ugh!" "A little bit more." "Lower," said Captain Deering, agonised whisper. "We shall bowstrung his excellency thinks us wanting respect." The orphan thus admonished made effort, he went Head first! There chattering, horrible sounds going on, Captain Deering scrambled unfortunate orphan, latter thought his time come. The captain dragged his feet, however. Then presentation proceeded with. "His Excellency Ali Kungham Ben Nardbake," cried dignitary standing beside pasha, voice like toastmaster. "Good gracious me!" exclaimed orphan, "all that?" "That is half it," said Captain Deering. "To faithful, he known well Sid Ney Ali Ben Lesters puar Nasr ed Bowstrung Strattford Bustum." Mr. Figgins greatly alarmed this. "Powerful memories his godfathers godmothers must had," he murmured. Beside pasha stood official, beard extraordinary length. "Who is that?" "Hush?" whispered Deering; "do not speak loud." "Who he?" asked orphan, sinking his voice. "The one beard?" "Yes." "His name Whiska Said Mahmoud Ben Ross Latreille," returned Deering. "Dear, dear!" murmured orphan, despairing accents, "I shall never----" "Ease her, stop her!" cried familiar voice Mr. Figgins's ear, "you have got knot." It Nat Cringle. All hushed. The bearded official looked pasha, nodded. Then drawing his sword, he signed two his men, Nat Cringle, looking dreadfully frightened, bustled behind curtain rigged across saloon, pasha's back. "What going do?" asked orphan, his teeth chattering alarm. Captain Deering much affected stage proceedings he covered his face his pocket-handkerchief. "Poor Nat!" "What it?" faltered Mr. Figgins, faintly. "Did see cord taken away Nat?" demanded captain, funereal bass. "Ye-es." "Then hark." Mr. Figgins hark, awful sound reached behind curtain. It like expiring groans hapless porker hands ruthless butcher, thing else could compare to. A fatal struggle going behind curtain. Groans dying wails heard awhile. Awful sounds. Then still. "Oh, it?" murmured orphan, distress. "Squiziz Wizen, pasha's executioner, dealt upon poor Nat Cringle." "What!" gasped Figgins. "Bowstrung," returned Captain Deering. The orphan turned faint. Then he turned door, would fled. "Oh, let go home," he cried. "I do not feel happy here." But Deering stayed him. "You must go, Mr. Figgins," whispered Captain Deering. "Why not?" "His excellency address us." The pasha coughed. "_Quel est votre jeu?_" demanded his excellency. "What he say?" asked Figgins. "Batta pudn," continued his excellency, gracious air; "also bono Jonni." "He says may present whatever brought," whispered captain. "I have brought nothing," returned Mr. Figgins. "Nothing?" "No; I forgot." "Thoughtless man," said Captain Deering. "Take this." He thrust parcel brown paper his hands. "What shall I it?" "Place cushion his excellency." Mr. Figgins complied. "Luciousosity," said pasha, looking upon offering greedily. Then he clapped his hands vigorously three times. The minister appeared, leading two veiled ladies. The pasha made remarks his language, Captain Deering commissioned render English. "His excellency, recognising generous offering," said he, "presents choicest gifts his seraglio, two wives. You must cherish life." The orphan's countenance fell this. The capital punishment poor Nat Cringle nothing this. "Tell I would rather take two," he whispered Deering. "Why not?" ejaculated latter. "I wish live single." The bearded minister approached, leading two veiled beauties. "Oh! oh, dear," groaned poor orphan. He placed gloved hand upon Mr. Figgins's shoulders. Then, upon given signal, threw arms around orphan hugged him, violent cachinnation heard. "What lovely smile," said Captain Deering. "Did hear it?" "Oh! Please do not," cried orphan. He struggled get free. But beauties seraglio held tight. The orphan grew desperate, jerked clutches. But tussle he flopped ground again. "Infidel dog!" roared pasha, venting his wrath English, "barbarian idolater, thou shalt die!" Thereupon, Captain Deering dropped beside orphan, sued mercy. "Be merciful, O great prince!" he cried. "Have pity humblest slave. His heart filled gratitude." The pasha growled reply indistinct, startled Figgins, sounded like rumbling distant thunder. "Oh, shall I do?" moaned orphan. "Oh, somebody take home." "Silence," whispered Captain Deering. "Prostrate do. Bury face silent, his excellency bids rise. He may overlook it." Mr. Figgins scarce dared breathe. There he lay, his face upon ground, humbly awaiting stern despot's permission move. * * * * He waited long--very long. While he waited thus, strange commotion observed amongst pasha's suite. The chief officer removed his turban beard, and--wonderful relate!--beneath laughing face Harry Girdwood. He winked his august master, hurriedly removed his turban beard well. And pasha bore marvellous resemblance Jack Harkaway younger. They helped drag other's robes--for beneath Turkish garments everyday clothes. The veiled beauties harem disrobed. Beneath veils feminine attire familiarly garbed, glance revealed Tinker his body-guard Bogey. "Now then, Mr. Figgins," said Nat Cringle, "wake up." The orphan looked amazement sound. "Nat Cringle!" "Hullo!" Mr. Figgins looked wonderment. Facing Jack Harkaway, sitting upon camp stool, beside stood his constant companion, Harry Girdwood. Engaged conversation Captain Deering, subject conversation appeared orphan himself. The Turkish soldiers people generally forming pasha's suite disappeared, places several sailors, appeared considerably amused something. When Mr. Figgins sat looked him, he muttered-- "What is this?" "A serious case, Harry," said Jack, gravely. "Very." "A case doctor." "What mean?" "These habits drinking grow upon one," said Harry Girdwood, sadly. "I do not understand," faltered orphan. "Shall help bed, sir?" asked one sailors compassionately. "Never!" cried Mr. Figgins, majesty. "Oh, yes, do," said Harry. But nerved desperation, orphan tore away them, darted door. "I shall go report upon outrageous doings captain ship," he said, drawing up. "Here is captain himself," said good-natured voice behind him. "And now, he you, Mr. Figgins?" The orphan turned. There captain. "Mr. Figgins," said captain, serious air, shaking his forefinger him, "you indulging early day." "What?" He could endure more. With cry disgust, he dashed past captain, scrambled stairs deck. Once there, he shot like race horse along deck, gaining his berth, he locked in. But even he could shut ringing laughter incorrigible practical jokers. Mr. Figgins, may guess, seen day. * * * * Upon day following events related, Jack received letters home. And among one created little excitement amongst nearest friends Jack Harkaway. "Do think probable he will come?" "I should not wonder," said Harry Girdwood. "I like see his dear old face again," said Jack. "I will bet penny shall see yet; here, least next stage," said Harry. "It would rare treat talk someone seen dear folks home." "It would indeed. I hope he come." And hope would come? Can guess reader? No. Then read on, learn reasons bring friend home roaming distant shore meet Jack his friends. CHAPTER LXIV. THE SAPIENT DOCTOR MUGGINS CAME IN HASTE--IMPEDIMENTS IN THE WAY OF THE PRESCRIPTION--DWELLS ON ARTIFICIAL LIMBS--OLD-REMINISCENCES--THE TORMENTOR. Reader, return little time old friend, Mole, England. Mr. Mole sad. For many years his life old Isaac Mole led wandering career, he found exceedingly difficult, say irksome, settle prosy existence dropped into. He never complained, true. But he fell sort settled melancholy, nothing could shake off, even grew neglectful bottle. His friends grew anxious. They wished take medical advice. He resisted persuasion stoutly. So recourse artifice, invited eminent medical man house visitor. And guise friendly chat, doctor took his observations. But peculiar ailment, ailment could called, Isaac Mole, completely baffled man science first. It casual conversation that, observing man, he discovered real truth. "Our patient wants roving commission," said physician himself. And he communicated his convictions old Jack. "I scarcely believe possible, doctor," said Jack. But doctor positive. "Nothing good get move; I am sure I he physical ailment." "What is done then?" demanded Harkaway. "He cannot travel alone." "I do not know that," said doctor; "he is hale wiry enough. The difficulty I see, Mrs. Mole." "I will undertake get that," said Jack. "You will?" "Yes." "It settled then," said physician, smile. "Good." "What would good physic world, would send son." "My Jack!" "Yes." "Impossible. Why, Jack _en route_ Turkey." "What that?" coolly inquired doctor. "Consider distance, dear doctor." "Pshaw, sir. Distance nothing nowadays. It different thing I boy. Take word it, Mr. Harkaway, patient jump chance." "He is much attached roving boy." "I know it," returned doctor. "Never day passes he speaks him; I declare I never single interview Mr. Mole, he managed somehow turn conversation upon son his pranks." "Oh, Jack, he played dreadful tricks." "Yes," returned physician dryly, "and Jack's father, accounts." "Ahem!" "And yet I really believe he enjoys recollection boy's infamous practical jokes." "I believe right," responded Harkaway. A day two later doctor seated Mr. Mole. "Mr. Mole." "Doctor." "Your health must looked to. You will travel." "How, doctor?" said Mole. "Young Harkaway foreign parts, his prolonged absence causes his parents considerable uneasiness, must go look him." Mole's eyes twinkled. "Do mean it?" "I do. When would like start?" "To-day." "Very good. The sooner better," said doctor. Mr. Mole's countenance fell suddenly. An ugly thought crossed him. What would Mrs. Mole say? "There one matter I would like consult on, doctor." "What might be?" demanded doctor. "My wife might word say upon subject." "I undertake remove her scruples," said doctor. "You will?" "Yes. She never object she knows important mission is." "Doctor," exclaimed Mr. Mole, joyously; "you trump." A delay naturally occurred, however. Mr. Mole could travel his wooden stumps, his friends one agreed. No. He must pair cork legs made. The doctor attending old friend knew maker artificial limbs wonderful man, according accounts. "Yes," said Mole, "cork legs well hosed will----" At moment voice tuning window cut short, "He gave his leg undertaker, And sent skilful cork-leg maker. Ritooral looral." "That is Dick Harvey. Infamous!" ejaculated Mr. Mole. "On brace broomsticks never I will walk, But I will symmetrical limbs cork. Ritooral looral." "Monstrous!" exclaimed Mr. Mole; "close window, sir, please." It well say "Close it," easier said done. Dick Harvey fixed beyond skill skilful mechanician unfasten. * * * * The aggravating minstrel continued without-- "Than timber cork better half, Examine likewise elegant calf. Ritooral looral----" "I window closed," cried Mole. He arose, forgetting his haste he minus one leg, he rolled. The artificial limb-maker lunged him, succeeded infinite difficulty getting his feet again. "Dear, dear!" said Mr. Mole. "No matter, I manage it." He picked nearest object hand, hurled window. CHAPTER LXV. HOW THE ORPHAN BECAME POSSESSED OF A FLUTE. But must leave Mole time, return friends travels. When next landed Turkish town, Mr. Figgins went different hotel patronised young Jack, whose practical joking rather much orphan. But found out, paid visit one morning. After first greeting, Mr. Figgins observed unusually thoughtful. At length, long silence he exclaimed-- "I cannot account it, I really cannot." "What cannot account for, Mr. Figgins?" asked young Jack. "The strange manners people country," answered orphan. "Of complain particularly?" inquired Jack. "Well, it is this; wherever I go, I seem quite object curiosity." "Of interest mean, Mr. Figgins," returned Jack, winking Harry Girdwood; "you Englishman, know, Englishmen always interesting foreigners." "I cannot say that," orphan replied; "I know I cannot show nose doors without pointed at." "Ah, yes. You excite interest moment make appearance." "Then, I walk streets, dark swarthy men stare follow till I quite crowd heels." "Another proof interest take you." "Well, I do not like all," said orphan, fretfully; "and dogs bark distressing manner." "It is way bidding welcome," remarked Harry Girdwood. "I wish would not take notice all; it is nuisance." "Perhaps you would like leave barking, take biting?" "No, it is I should not like, it is I am constantly afraid do," wailed poor orphan. There slight pause, young Jack his comrade grinned quietly other, presently former said-- "I think I account this." "Can you?" asked Mr. Figgins. "How?" "It lies dress wear." "In dress?" "Yes; Turkish country, although I admit look well splendid new tourist suit, cross-barred four colours, I fancy would better dressed Turk stay here." "A Turk, Jack?" "Yes; now, head shaved, dress like Turk," said Jack, "all wonderment would cease, would go out, come in, without exciting remark." Mr. Figgins fell back his chair. "Ha-ha-have head sha-a-ved, dress li-like Turk?" he gasped. "You surely do not mean that?" "I do, indeed," replied Jack, seriously. "What? Wear baggy breeches, enormous turban, slippers turned toes! What would natives say?" "Why, they would say sensible individual," remarked Harry. "Do not remember old saying?--'When you are Turkey, must Turkey does.'" Mr. Figgins reflected moment. "And really think I go in, regular Turkish fit-out, I allowed enjoy walks peace?" he asked, length. "Decidedly," answered his counsellors, utmost gravity. "Then I will take advice, Turk notice," said orphan; "but there is one thing still." "What is that?" "My complexion is not near dark enough one infidels." "Oh, will not matter," said Jack; "only slip Turkish togs. Go quantity turban, will not care button complexion." "Very well, then, that is settled; I will turn Turk once. But must I head shaved?" "That is important," said Jack. Having made his mind point, orphan put his hat, taking sip brandy compose his nerves, he sallied forth, directing his steps nearest barber's. On his way thither he attracted usual amount attention, he reached barber's shop, he found accompanied select crowd deriding Turks, dozen yelping curs, shouting barking concert. The barber received extreme Eastern courtesy. "What English signor require hands humblest his slaves?" deferential inquiry. "I fancy turn Turk, I want head shaved," explained Mr. Figgins, nervously; "pray careful, since I am poor orphan, who----" Before he time finish his sentence, he found wedged chair towel his chin. The next moment his head, energetic manipulation operator, creamy mass lather. "Be sure do not cut head off," murmured orphan, he watched razor flashing fro along strop. "Your servant disturb minutest pimple," said barber. With wonderful celerity, artist went work. In less two minutes cranium Mark Antony Figgins smooth destitute hair bladder lard. Then followed process shampooing, soothing orphan's feelings. At length, operation completed, barber bade orphan put his hat--which loss his hair went his eyes rested his nose--and left shop. His friends--the mob dogs--had waited outside patiently. If his appearance interesting before, interest greatly increased. A loud shout welcomed him, he proceeded along street difficulties, holding his hat one hand, crowd his heels. Straight bazaar he went. Here he found venerable old Turkish Jew, seemed divine instinct he wanted. "Closhe, shignor, closhe," he cried broken English. "Shtep take choice." Before bewildered orphan knew he was, he found interior Ibrahim's emporium. Here profusion garments displayed his eyes. Having preference particular colour, he took Jew pressed upon him. In short time his costume complete, consisting pair ample white trousers, blue shirt, surmounted crimson vest, secured waist purple sash, his feet pair yellow slippers Morocco leather. The turban alone wanting. "Be sure let good big turban," urged Mr. Figgins. Ibrahim assured he one big he could carry, he kept his word. Unrolling great many yards stuff, he formed turban enormous dimensions green yellow stripe, he placed upon head his customer. "Shall I do? Do I look like native Turk?" asked latter, he put his things. "Do?" echoed Jew, exultingly. "If ish true dat de closhe makes de man, vill excellent vell, de people vill run you." Mr. Figgins settled his account Hebrew clothier, paid three times much he ought done, went considerable confidence, looking gaudy his mixture bright colours macaw. "No one dare jeer now," he persuaded himself. But he mistaken. Hardly he taken half dozen steps his brilliant costume attracted great notice. "What splendid Turk!" cried some. "Who magnificent bashaw?" asked others, he strutted past. No one knew, upon nearer examination seen "splendid Turk" "magnificent bashaw" Turk all. Indignation seized upon moment filled admiration. "Impostor, unbelieving dog!" shouted enraged populace. "He accursed Giaour, dress follower Prophet." At this, fierce yell rose upon air. "Down wretch!" "Tear pieces!" "Let impaled!" cried multitude. With dire threats, angry crowd rushed towards Mr. Figgins, headed short, fat Turk, particularly indignant. The luckless orphan, anxious avoid terrible doom threatening him, rushed away opposite direction. The Turks not, rule, remarkable swift running. Mr. Figgins, whose pace quickened dreadful prospect stake his body, would easily distanced them. But unfortunately, his green yellow striped turban, dislodged position, fell--as his hat previously done--over his eyes, almost smothered him. He tugged away he ran, order get rid it. But he succeeded loosen one ends. Gradually turban began unwind itself, end trailing ground. The Turk pursuit caught end, grasping firmly, brought his weight bear upon fugitive. Suddenly hapless Figgins began feel strong symptoms strangulation. The next moment, sharp jerk burly Turk pulled ground. But saved him. No sooner he prostrate his back turban slipped his head, he free. Springing his feet, he darted speed human grocer could ever dreamt of. He soon far beyond pursuit. All he lost his green yellow striped turban. But loss that, though somewhat fretted him, saved his life. He found retired spot, one near, he sat reflect recover his breath. "What country is," he thought; "pleasant enough, though, far climate goes; people awful! What lot bloodthirsty, bilious-looking wretches, sure; ready consign torture death poor innocent, unprotected orphan he happens different colour themselves!" So perturbed thoughts Mr. Figgins he obliged smoke cigar soothe himself. But even failed quiet his agitated nerves. His mind full gloomy apprehensions. "Where I?" he asked himself. "How I get home? I shall sure meet rabble, dogs I shall torn pieces. What become me--wretched orphan I am! What shall I do?" Hardly he uttered distressful exclamations prolonged note melody caught his ear. "Hark!" he said himself, "there music. 'Music hath charms soothe savage breast,' says poet, seems soothing effect upon nerves." The strain died away, heard longer. Mark Antony Figgins despair. "Play again, sweet instrument," he cried, anxiously, "play again." Again sweet note sounded solitary orphan felt comforted. "It is flute; must flute," he murmured himself, he listened. "I always liked flute. It is soft melancholy." The grocer faint recollection his boyhood's days, he tolerably efficient performer penny whistle. Just moment mournful note he heard recalled past vividly. So vividly, Mr. Figgins, depths his loneliness, fixed his eyes sadly turned-up toes his leather slippers, wept. As melody proceeded, drops pour copiously orphan's eyes. And wonder, doleful too-tooings ever uttered wind instrument, dolefullest. But suited Mr. Figgin's mood moment. "It is Turkish flute, I suppose," he sobbed; "but it is beau-you-you-tiful. I wish I flute." He got looked round, found outside enclosure thick trees. It evidently within enclosure flute player located. As reader knows, nothing bold daring Mark Antony Figgins. But flute seemed inspired kind supernatural recklessness. "I would give almost thing flute," he murmured himself. "I feel I like play flute. I wonder playing it, whether he would sell it?" The unseen performer, juncture, burst forth powerfully shrill cadence orphan quite thrilled delight. "A railway whistle's fool it!" he cried, he clapped his hands ecstasy. "Bravo, bravo! Encore!" Having shouted his applause till he hoarse, he walked along side wall, seeking anxiously place entrance. At length he came open gate. A stout gentleman--unmistakably Turk--with crimson cap his head, ornamented tassel, long, reed-like instrument his hand, looking cautiously forth. It evidently musician, who, interrupted his solo, come see delinquent disturbed him. The enthusiastic Figgins caught sight flute, sufficient. Forgetting his usual nervous timidity, he rushed forward. "My dear sir," he exclaimed, "it exquisite--delicious! Pray oblige another tune--or, objection, let attempt one." As he spoke, excited Figgins stretched forth his hands. The owner flute, evidently suspected attempt robbery, quietly placed his instrument behind him, looking hard Figgins, said sternly-- "What son dog art thou?" To Figgins replied mildly-- "You are mistaken, dear sir; I am son father mother, they--alas!--are more, I poor desolate orphan." The tears trickled his eyes he spoke. The Turk appear least affected. "What bosh this?" he asked, moment, hard, unsympathetic tone. "It is bosh all, I assure you, dear signor," replied Figgins, earnestly; "the fact is, I heard play flute, sweet tones soothed spirits--which moment extremely low--that I come make several requests." "Umph!" growled Turk; "what they?" "First, play another charming airs, next, allow attempt one myself, thirdly, sell instrument hold hand.'" The Turk glared moment fiercely proposer modest requests, politely wishing graves his departed relatives might perpetually defiled, he replied curtly-- "First, I going play to-night; next, I see Jehanum[1] I allow play; thirdly, I will not sell flute." [1] The abode lost spirits. With words, he stepped back garden slammed gate Mr. Figgins' face. "I shall never get this," Figgins murmured himself, gloomily; "that flute would cheered solitary hours, ruthless Turk refuses part it. Now, indeed, I feel peace mind gone forever." His grief juncture became overpowering, he leant door, his despair hammered his head. Suddenly door burst open, distressed orphan, his brilliant array, shot backwards shrubs prickly nature, whose sharp thorns added his agonizing sensations. "Will anybody kind enough put end misery?" he wailed, he lay his back, feeling though he transformed human pincushion. He little surprised hear familiar voice exclaim-- "Lor' bless me! dat you, Massa Figgins?" Glancing up, he espied black face Bogey looking upon him. "Yes, it is me," he answered, wailing tone; "help up." "Gib fist," cried Bogey. Mr. Figgins extended his hand, negro grasping it, vigorous jerk hoisted prostrate grocer his thorny bed, tingling though he stung nettles. Bogey quite astounded transformation his dress. "Why, Massa Figgins, out-and-out guy look!" he exclaimed; "whar hair gone to?" The orphan groaned. He thinking another h-air (without h), air he heard Turkish flute. Just moment too-too-too instrument sounded again. Figgins stood like one absorbed. All his agonizing pains forgotten. "How sweet, plaintive!" he murmured himself; "too-too-too, tooty-tooty-too!" he hummed, imitation sound. Bogey heard also, involuntarily put his hands big stomach made comically wry face. "Whar dat orful squeakin' row?" he asked. "Hush, hush!" exclaimed orphan, holding his hands reprovingly, turning his eyes time; "it is heavenly music; it is flute, boyhood's favourite instrument." "Gorra!" muttered Bogey; "it 'nuff gib fellar de mullingrubs back belly." He looked towards Mr. Figgins, seeing standing his hands clasped looking like white-washed Turk trance, he said-- "What de matter wid yer, Massa Figgins? Am ill?" "That flute, melodious flute, breathes forth dulcet notes peace," murmured orphan, deep, absorbed whisper. "I must flute." Bogey felt little anxious. "Me t'ink Massa Figgins getting lilly soft nut; losing hair turn mad," he said himself. "I must flute," repeated grocer, abstracted tone manner. "I think cheap ten pounds." Bogey, hearing this, opened his eyes wide. He thought he saw chance profitable bit business his account. So, instant, he said quietly-- "Good flute worth dan ten pounds; rale good blower like dat worth twenty de bery least." "Yes, yes; I would give twenty willingly," murmured wrapt Figgins. "Bery good," said Bogey, he instantly disappeared gate. The orphan remained waiting without. The "too-too-tooing" going usual doleful melancholy manner, guided sound, Bogey crept forward till he came sight performer, seated snug nook his garden playing away his heart's content; or, negro supposed, endeavouring frighten away birds. Bogey took stock stout player his flute. Creeping along shrubbery till he got exactly opposite flautist, he, midst too-too-tooing, uttered unearthly groan. "Inshallah!" exclaimed Turk, stopping suddenly; "what that?" "It war me," groaned hidden Bogey deeply before. "Who you?" faltered musician, hearing mysterious voice, seeing one. "Me special messenger de Prophet," Bogey replied. "Allah Kerim! dream coming true. Is Prophet speaks?" gasped Turk, his olive cheeks turning hue saffron. "Iss, de profit brings here," returned Bogey, truthfully. "What message he send his slave?" asked old Turk. "He say make sich orful row wid dat flute he git sleep, an', derefore, he send stop it. You got gib de flute direckly." The teeth half-silly musician chattering his head. His optics rolled wildly side side. Just crisis Bogey, his eyes glaring his white teeth fully exposed, thrust his black face foliage. "Drop it," he cried, hideous grin. He occasion repeat command. With yell terror horrified Turkish gentleman, really half idiot, away his keepers, let fall his instrument his trembling fingers, starting up, waddled away spot though furies him, special messenger Prophet quietly picked flute chuckle, retraced his steps gate. Here he found Mr. Figgins. He could scarcely believe his eyes he saw negro precious instrument his hand. "The flute, flute!" he cried, "the soother sorrow, orphan's comforter. Let clutch grasp. Oh, brings back boyhood's days." As he spoke, he rushed forward eagerly seize treasure. But Bogey stuck it. "Money fust, Massa Figgins," he said, grin, "twenty poun' de price, yah know, an' dis fuss-rate blower. Too-too-too, tooty-tum-too," he sounded instrument. The orphan frantic. "I have not twenty pounds me," he exclaimed, excitedly, "but I will pay moment get home, five pounds interest. You know I am well off, also man word." Bogey know this, afraid trust him. "Well, den, dere de flute," he said; "but do not begin too-too-tooin' till git good way off, else p'r'aps de gem'l'm wid de red cap hear send dog arter de speshal messenger de Prophet." Mr. Figgins pledged blow note till mile spot least, strength promise, Bogey gave instrument. But sooner excited orphan find his possession he forgot his promises, putting flute his lips, he commenced "The Girl I Left Behind Me," brilliant manner--so brilliant indeed reached ears owner inside, and, Bogey shrewdly suspected would case, latter began slight suspicions he done his flute impostor. Very soon his voice heard calling his dogs, almost immediately loud barkings heard. "Run, run, Massa Figgins, de dogs tear yah pieces," shouted Bogey. "They may tear limb limb," returned orphan "but shall not rob flute." And without taking instrument his lips, he ran playing "Cheer, Boys, Cheer," he hurried along. The next moment rushed several gaunt-looking animals, gave chase musical Figgins, urged mad master, following them. Bogey waited gate. As he came forth puffing, grunting, blowing, negro put his foot, he went his nose. "Go back, massa bag breeches," cried Bogey, fiercely. He added effect his words applying switch he carried fat hind-quarters Turk, glad scramble his gate fours, shut keep "special messenger" his cane. When Bogey came Mr. Figgins, he found usually timid personage his back tree, battle his canine foes, making sad havoc his Moslem garments. "Bravo, Massa Figgins," cried Bogey, he rushed among yelping pack, "we soon get rid dese heah." With he laid energy Turkish dogs, utterly bewildered, dropped ears, tucking tails legs, slunk howling away, whilst triumphant orphan accompanied flight lively tune his flute. Accompanied Bogey, Mark Antony reached his quarters safety. He promptly paid price his instrument, set steadily practise, great horror house. * * * * A week passed. Then following conversation took place young Jack Harkaway his comrade Harry Girdwood. "I say, old fellow, fond music?" "Well, depends sort music is," Jack replied. "What think Figgins' instrumental performance?" "Well, I think it is awful row." "So I; he does not seem think so." "No; he is always it; day long half night; he will blow inside his flute he goes rate. I consider comes head nuisance." "Most decidedly," said Jack, "and like nuisances, must put stop to." "All right: let us send once." Bogey summoned dispatched polite message young Jack, he would glad speak him. On receiving message, he repaired room Jack Harry Girdwood located, preparing another practical joke benefit orphan. Mr. Figgins took his flute him, too-tooed way till he reached door Jack's room. For Jack Harry, mentioned, followed orphan his new abode, secured rooms house. He entered. "Sit down, Mr. Figgins," said Jack. Mr. Figgins sat down, nursing his flute. "I sent you," Jack commenced. "Ah, I see, wish tune," cried orphan, much hilarity, he put flute his lips began play. "On contrary," cried Jack, quickly; "it is do not wish for; glad you would come stop." Mr. Figgins opened his eyes astonishment. "Come stop," he echoed; "is possible wish stop flute? Why, I thought liked music." "So I do," Jack replied, drily, "when music." "And is not flute music? Are tones soft sweet soothing spirits?" "We found quite reverse," Jack assured him; "in fact, do not put away flute, you will drive us mad, I would not like answer consequences--which might awful." Mr. Figgins looked aghast. "The idea exquisite music instrument discourses driving anyone mad," he exclaimed length, "is past belief." "You may call exquisite music, call awful row," Jack replied, candidly, "therefore goodness shut up." The orphan drew clutched his flute kind convulsive indignation. "I object shutting up, Mr. Harkaway," he exclaimed, determinately; "in fact, I shut up. In dulcet instrument I found balm woes, I intend play incessantly rest existence." "You will blow consumption," said Harry Girdwood. "Well, I do, I am poor orphan one regret," returned Mr. Figgins, tear trickling his nose thought his lonely condition; "I shall die breathing forth mournful melody, flute will----" "You leave us legacy, we will put glass case," said Harry. "No; flute shall buried silent grave." "We do not care you are dead," returned Jack, "but object annoyed you are alive." "Oh, shall not exposed annoyances account," said orphan, rising grandly; "I flute take departure together." With words he left room, shortly afterwards quitted house. * * * * Mr. Figgins determined keep apart Harkaway party, gave rooms he taken, search found another lodging upper chamber house retired part town. Here he determined settle down, devote ardour ever practice his favourite instrument. * * * * It night. Mr. Figgins bed, he could get sleep. Curious insects, common Eastern climes, crawled forth chinks walls cracks floor, nibbled orphan various parts his anatomy till he felt surface his skin one large blister. "What dreadful climate this," he murmured, he sat bed; "nothing creeping things everywhere. Phew! what is done?" He reflected moment. "I it!" he exclaimed, "my flute, precious flute, soothe me." Hopping nimbly bed, he dressed his European costume, seized his instrument, began tune. He playing day long, lodgers house congratulating cessation infliction, suddenly instrumental torture commenced again. "Too-too, too-tum-too, tooty-tum, tooty-tum, too-tum-too," went flute, shrill vigorous manner ever, whilst select party dogs, attracted melody, assembled window howled concert. In chamber next occupied infatuated Figgins lodged Turk, Bosja name. Bosja, first place, taste music, particularly detested sound flute. Secondly, he suffering excruciating toothache, incessant too-tum, too-tum, tooty-tum-too--with additional music dogs--drove mad. He sitting his pipe his mouth, green, yellow-striped turban pulled his ears, trying shut sound, vain. "Oh, oh! Allah merciful me!" he groaned, irritated nerve gave extra twinge. "Too-too, too-tum-too, too-tum, too-tum, tooty-tum-too," orphan's flute answered him. "Allah confound wretch his tooty-tum-too!" growled distracted sufferer; "if he knew I enduring." But Mr. Figgins know. Probably he would cared he known, he continued pour forth melodious squeakings his entire satisfaction. At length patience Bosja utterly exhausted, he summoned landlady. "What son Shitan got next room?" he demanded her, fiercely. "I know little him," returned mistress house; "only he Frankish gentleman, dresses sometimes Turk, lately come lodge here." "He dog, son dog! May his flute choke him, his father's grave defiled!" growled irascible Turk, "tell leave off, I kill burn his flute." The landlady went tapped door musical lodger. There response save too-too-too flute. "Signor!" she called moment. "What is matter?" inquired Mr. Figgins within; "do wish come play tune?" he continued "too-too, tooty-too." "The gentleman next room objects sound flute." "Does he?--tooty-too, tooty-too." "Yes; he begs you will leave off." "I shall not!--tooty-tum, tooty-tum, tooty-too. I intend play night." The landlady, delivered her message, went downstairs. Mr. Figgins still continued blow away agonized Bosja mutter curses loud, deep, upon his head his instrument. But patience limits, Bosja, never remarkable virtue, sworn oaths he knew twice over, last sprang his bed, dashing his pipe, rapped fiercely wall. "What want? Shall I come play tunes you?" inquired orphan, placidly pausing instant. "You vile son perdition, stop accursed noise!" shouted Turk. "Too-too, tooty-too." "Do hear, unbelieving dog?" "Tooty-too--yes, I hear--tooty-tooty-tooty-too." "Then do not stop?" "Because I intend go on--too-tum-too--all night" "But you are driving distraction." "Nonsense; go bed sleep--tooty-tum, tooty-tum, tooty-too. You like beautiful flute time." "But I cannot sleep infernal tooty-too ears, I have got toothache." "Have out. You will feel better." This cool irony part Mr. Figgins like oil poured upon fierce temper irascible Bosja, he shouted loudly-- "If I hear diabolical 'tootum-too,' I swear Allah I will take life, give body crows vultures." "Ha, ha!" laughed reckless Figgins. "Tooty-tum, tooty-tum, too-tum--" But he could finish his musical phrase, maddened Bosja seized his scimitar, rushed like bull partition. The partition thin, Turk burly thick, he plunged head first orphan's apartment, little surprise dismay latter. It quite picture. Bosja waved his weapon his head; Mark Antony Figgins hopped upon bed wrapped tightly round clothes, clutching his flute his side. For moment pair stood glaring other. "Your flute, vile dog, life," shouted Turk. "I object part either," cried orphan. "Go tooth out, happy." Down came scimitar swish direction his head. But grocer quickly withdrawn beneath clothes. Not thwarted, however, his vengeance, burly Bosja swooped upon heap, dragged his grasp, orphan included. "Now I you," he cried, he seized obnoxious flute. "Give instrument, infidel," shrieked orphan, he threw blanket, clung flute desperation. At moment, he recognised green yellow-striped turban head Turk. It Bosja whose hands fallen, Mr. Figgins escaping mob. "That turban," he cried, one hand he dragged his enemy's head, dauntless vehemence, bringing his flute smart crack Turk's bald pate. The Turk, much bully hero, quite confounded excited energy Frankish lodger displayed. Dropping his scimitar, he struggle flute. Round room went, pulling hauling. At length, lurching door, burst open. The combatants found landing. Here struggle continued, till, length, giving desperate tug, flute came half, Bosja fell backwards, head heels, stairs, upper joint instrument his hand. The landlady, thought house falling, came hurrying see happened, found Turk lying heap bottom stairs, breath almost knocked his body. It took time bring himself. It he recovering loud knocking street door. On opening it, body Turkish soldiers appeared drawn front it. "What disturbance?" inquired leader troop. Bosja quickly gave his version happened. Of course, highly exaggerated. He, true believer, assaulted, robbed his turban, thrown downstairs rascally dog Giaour, lodged room next him. This quite sufficient arouse indignation officer, and, three his troop, functionary ascended seize delinquent. But, reaching room, discovered empty. "The Frankish hound laughs beards," said officer. "He escaped window." And intention Mark Antony Figgins. But accustomed perilous descents, he found baffled his flight, perched ledge, half way window ground, unable either proceed return. He soon espied soldiers, shout announced his detection. A ladder quickly procured, luckless orphan shortly found prisoner. "What dirt eating?" demanded officer, sternly. "I have not eating dirt all," returned indignant Figgins, "but I believe fat Turk swallowed half flute." Bosja came forward missing portion his hand, handed officer. The orphan made snatch it, received box ear officer. The half his cherished instrument wrested him, he marched lock-up case could tried morrow bashaw. CHAPTER LXVI. HOW THE FLUTE ADVENTURE TERMINATED. The morrow come. Hearing Frank tried, court crowded. At appointed hour Mark Antony Figgins, looking particularly doleful, conducted his cell presence administrator law. Osman, ruling bashaw, although Turk, regular Tartar deal with. He administered plenty law, little justice; latter required, money bashaw's idol, must handsomely paid for. As soon parties brought in, judicial potentate eyed sternly time. Then he said-- "Which plaintiff?" "I am," exclaimed Bosja. "No; I am," exclaimed Mr. Figgins. "What bosh this?" cried bashaw; "you cannot plaintiffs." "Most high mighty, he robbed turban knocked stairs," affirmed Bosja. "No, worship; he robbed turban stole half flute," protested orphan. The official dignitary frowned shut his eyes reflectively. He foresaw he case unusual intricacy him, he thinking he deal it. After moment he opened his eyes, rubbed his nose profoundly, sneezed. All officials imitated superior rubbing noses sneezing concert. The uproar tremendous. Order length restored, bashaw fixed his eyes upon Bosja, said him-- "Let hear say." "It this. Your slave last night troubled toothache, retired his couch. The pain kept awake, I going sleep--" "Stop!" cried bashaw; "you say pain kept awake, say going sleep. You could not awake asleep time." A hum applause ran round court sagacious remark. "He speaks words wisdom," murmured some. "What lawyer he is," whispered others. "I awake hours," explained Bosja, "when pain lulled little, I began doze." "Well, began doze, then?" "Then I disturbed dreadful squeaking noise next room." "A rat?" "No, highness; flute." "That flute, worship," cried indignant orphan; "whose dulcet tone he calls dreadful sque----" "Silence, dog," shouted bashaw. "Silence," shouted everyone else. "Continue," said judge Bosja. "I endured dreadful sound long I could, anguish tooth became great I could bear longer, I sent civil messenger Frank yonder cease." "And he complied request?" "Not he, mightiness. He played louder, dreadful noise he made nearly killed me." "I room, worship," interposed Mr. Figgins, "and right play loud I liked." The bashaw referred his vizier. "What says law?" he asked, low tone. "Does permit man he likes his room?" The vizier scratched his nose reflected. All officials scratched noses reflected. After moment vizier replied-- "It depends, wise illustrious. If owner room true believer, he may turn upside he please, else." "Good; flute-player infidel--a dog." "I beg pardon, sir, I am retired grocer," put Figgins, overheard remark. "Silence," growled bashaw; "go on, plaintiff." "Well, highness," continued Bosja, "I continued get worse worse dreadful 'too-tooting', last, driven desperation, I sprang bed, hammered wall, imploring quiet." "And he still refused?" "He did, mightiness." "And you?" "I imploring Allah soften his unmerciful heart, suddenly he burst partition, thin----" "No, no, no, worship," interrupted Mr. Figgins, vehemently, "it he burst through, me." "Silence," cried bashaw; "dare interrupt words truth." "But they are words truth, worship; they are abominable--false." "Silence, dog," shouted potentate, crimson anger. "Silence, dog," echoed rest judicial body. "Continue, plaintiff." "Well, highness," went Bosja, "he seized violently, tore turban head, endeavoured thrust his diabolical, 'too-tooing' instrument throat." "To objected?" "Strongly, highness. I seized flute self-defence, came half hand, he dragged room, gigantic strength, hurled backwards stairs." "Allah Kerin, mercy back broken," exclaimed bashaw. "I feel sore over, highness," said Bosja, ruefully, "and fear I seriously injured." "And culprit endeavouring escape, he not?" asked judge. "He was, mightiness, soldiers discovered clinging wall," replied officer soldiers. "Wallah thaih, well said." The bashaw conferred his vizier moment, then, turning towards luckless Figgins, found changed plaintiff defendant, he said sternly-- "And now, unbelieving dog, say?" "Only this," orphan replied, without hesitation; "that witness uttered tissue abominable lies." "I spoken naught truth," exclaimed unblushing Bosja, solemnly. "Bashem ustun, upon head it." "Well, let us hear account give," said bashaw defendant. "My account simple," said Figgins. "I playing flute, Turk insisted stopping. I considered I right I liked apartment refused." "You right liked." "What, chamber I paid for?" "Certainly not." Mr. Figgins shook his clenched fist fiercely air extraordinary declaration. "There is neither law justice here," he cried, indignantly. "In England----" "You are England, dog," shouted bashaw, "you are Turkey." The orphan felt painfully moment he was. "I do not care soon I am miserable den thieves rogues," he said. "What fellow say?" demanded bashaw, quite understand orphan said. "He says his face whitened rays highness's wisdom, like he never seen," vizier interpreted. "Umph!" growled his superior. Then addressing defendant, he said-- "Go on." "Well, midst practice fat Turk burst partition room, scimitar hand. The first thing I saw his head turban, I lost week ago. I seized property----" "Inshallah!" shouted bashaw, "this fellow telling story other. He laughing beards making us eat dirt. I will hear more." "But, worship----" "I will hear more!" shouted judge. "I find guilty points." "But flute----" "Your flute forfeited." The orphan uttered cry despair. "My flute cost twenty-five pounds week since," he wailed dolefully. The bashaw pricked his ears words. A man could afford give twenty-five pounds flute must possessed property. The scales justice quivered whilst he whispered his vizier-- "This Frank rich, he not?" "Heaven forbid I venture dispute highness's opinion. Most his countrymen so," subordinate replied. "Let us see." Looking towards agitated grocer, bashaw said, modified tone-- "The law pronounces guilty. Still, mercy clemency, incline show favour. Your flute, seems paid twenty-five pounds, forfeited; but, another twenty-five may redeem it." The orphan dreadfully indignant. "What!" he cried, "pay twice what is property? I will not pay another farthing, pot-bellied old humbug." "What he say?" asked bashaw his vizier; "does he consent?" The interpreter turned slightly green dismay he stammered reply-- "He expresses utterly overpowered the--the--splendour highness's magnificent condescension; but--a--a--at time he present moment able a--avail it." "You mean say he sufficient funds--is it?" "Yes, highness." The disappointed bashaw uttered angry grunt, looking savagely prisoner, said him-- "Since cannot pay, must----" "I pay," shouted orphan, furiously indignant tone; "but I will not." The bashaw grinned like fiend, demanding flute handed him, held eyes whole court. "Be witness all," he exclaimed, "that yonder obstinate Frank despises clemency, refuses redeem flute, his property." "That flute his property, mine," cried voice crowd. At moment portly Turk, red fez cap, pressed forward. He recognised Kallum Beg, Turk distinction, times treated madman. "That flute mine, O noble bashaw!" he repeated. The judge winked blinked, seemed greatly perplexed unexpected declaration. "Yours?" he echoed, length. "Yes, highness. I robbed week since." "And lying son Shitan told us he bought twenty-five pounds." "So I did," protested orphan. "Silence!" roared bashaw, "you made us eat nothing dirt. You know stole it." Then turning rightful owner instrument, he said him-- "Kallum Beg, flute yours. Still contradicted open court, declaring property, I declared property another, fined fifty sequins." The Turk grunted, shrugged his shoulders, offences he instantly fined additional fifty sequins, making hundred fifty. There appeal, fine paid Kallum Beg received his flute. "And now," continued bashaw, "let unbelieving dog receive twenty strokes bastinado, soles his feet." In instant orphan jerked his legs, placed flat ground. The executioner stepped forward, removed his slippers, flourished his cane. "Begin," cried judge. Swish fell bamboo upon orphan's naked feet. The pain exquisite victim shrieked "Murder!" top his voice. The bashaw grinned ear ear. "Perhaps prisoner would rather pay suffer," he said, moment. "Yes, yes, I would," cried Mr. Figgins, desperately; "a great deal rather. How much?" "Ten sequins stroke. A hundred ninety sequins all." "I will pay sum. Oh, I ever leave delightful London?" said grocer. "Raise him!" said bashaw. The victim lifted up, messenger dispatched note young Jack Harkaway forward orphan's cash-box. In short time man returned, box handed bashaw, received key, helped double sum he demanded. "Now I suppose I am liberty," said Mr. Figgins, glancing, wistfully his cash box. "Not yet," returned grasping judge, money his possession, resolved appropriate much possible. "I am inclined think unjustly accused. I therefore permit particular favour avenge upon Bosja. You must fight him, kill can, I shall hold responsible." The orphan looked unutterable things permission, whilst Bosja, great coward heart, turned manner colours. "Your mightiness----" he began. But bashaw cut short. "You fined fifty sequins speaking spoken to," he cried; "treasurer, collect money." But Bosja single coin left. "Then he must go prison," said judge, sternly; "but till he fought man he falsely accused." "I have wish fight. I want go home," exclaimed Mr. Figgins. "You are fined another fifty sequins," remarked bashaw, blandly; "for wishing fight I say fight." Whilst judge dipped cash-box, executioner went weapons, shortly reappeared couple enormous scimitars, he placed hands combatants. A dead silence fell upon eager crowd, longed fight commence. "Are ready?" demanded bashaw. "N-n-n-no, I am not," faltered orphan, whose ferocity entirely disappeared loss his flute; "I am fighting man, I do not like fighting swords--I might get hurt. I would rather forgive Mr. Bosja kill him." His opponent evinced his satisfaction humane proposal ghastly smile. But his tongue stuck roof his mouth terror, he said nothing. But bashaw thwarted manner. "It fight," he said, determined tone; "and fight must, find substitute." The combatants strained eyes eagerly amongst crowd. But one volunteered take places. Suddenly Mr. Figgins caught sight black figure pantomiming eagerly distance. A flash joy rushed across his troubled spirit. It Tinker. He could judge his actions he ready take his place, therefore he exclaimed aloud-- "I have found substitute." "Where?" demanded bashaw, looking intensely disappointed. "Here de dustibute," shouted Tinker, reply; "make way, whitey-brown Turkies, an' let de rale colour come forrards." As he spoke, he elbowed his way crowd till he reached space front seat justice. Here he shook hands Mr. Figgins, nodded familiarly bashaw though he particular friend his. "What son Jehanum that?" growled bashaw, scowling fiercely Tinker. "He substitute," exclaimed grocer. "Is he? And know must pay allowed make use him?" asked bashaw. "No, old thief, I do not," said Figgins, softly; aloud--"how much?" "Two hundred sequins," said judge. "Oh, certainly," assented orphan; "no doubt intend empty box let go." This restored complacency bashaw, who, last demand used grocer's cash, finished taking possession his cash-box carry away in. Having locked safely up, he cried-- "I wish amused. Let fight commence once." Tinker received scimitar hands Mr. Figgins, flourished gaily round his head. Bosja, could afford pay substitute, made great effort pull together strife, he looked white, his teeth chattered audibly. "Now, slaves, begin," exclaimed judge. Tinker gave semi-savage yell, encourage his opponent, then, ferocious grin his dark face, he sprang forward. Bosja, scared his wits, struck wildly random. His scimitar came contact nothing air, whilst Tinker gave slight prod his sabre's point region his baggy breeches. Bosja felt it, believing seriously wounded, uttered doleful howl. The crowd applauded. Tinker hopped round nimbly tomtit jackdaw, presently gave another little taste his steel. [Illustration: "TINKER HOPPED ROUND HIM NIMBLY, AND GAVE HIM ANOTHER TASTE OF THE STEEL."--TINKER. VOL. II.] Bosja, fully impressed idea he bleeding death, began grow desperate. Grasping his scimitar firmly, he rushed his sable antagonist, Tinker, skilful manoeuvre, locked his hilt his foe's weapon, wrested his hand, following his advantage smart tap Bosja's skull flat his blade. This settler Turk, who, pleasing conviction his brains knocked out, uttered piteous groan, fell fainting ground. The spectators appear relish defeat countryman, loud murmurs discontent burst forth, midst bashaw rose. "Stop fight, arrest murderer," he cried. Several soldiers spectators advanced alacrity obey order, Tinker suddenly delivered one his startling war whoops flourished glittering scimitar his hands. Everyone stopped. It seemed prudent so, negro grinned gnashed his teeth like dark demoniac, he sharpened his weapons one upon other, preparatory deadly work destruction. Having performed operation, he cried-- "Now de amputashun going begin!" uttering another terrible yell, dashed amongst guards. The soldiers, astonished appalled, dropped weapons fled court, calling upon Prophet save wild fiend. Having got rid soldiers, Tinker tripped Kallum Beg, wresting his flute his hand, helped worthy individual creep his hands knees wholesome stimulant points his two scimitars. Next he sprang amongst spectators, shrieking flourishing his weapons. What clash steel hideous outcry he made, Moslem crowd beside terror. Struggling, shouting, declaring devil let loose, among them, fought, scratched, pulled turbans, tumbled till reached door. The court cleared. All bashaw his principal ministers, still congregated round judgment seat, blue terror. "Seize him! seize imp Jehanum!" "Allah preserve me!" cried potentate, holding tenaciously vizier. But vizier made attempt obey his superior. He clinging another vizier, imploring Allah preserve him. Up sprang Tinker, yelling waving his sword. "'Ssassinashun! spifl'cashun! string'lashun de 'ole lot ob yah!" he shouted. The officials wait operated upon. "Look cash-box," gasped bashaw, he waddled steps. The rest followed, forgetting everything personal safety. The cash box left behind. Tinker pounced upon it. "'Ooray!" he shouted, triumphantly; "him got de flute de cash-box well. Cock-a-doodle-doo!" Quick lightning he rushed door. At entrance he encountered bashaw, discovered his loss. "Son perdition, give property," he cried. Tinker gave immediately--on his head. The effect stunning. Down went "Cream Justice" "Flower wisdom" senseless ground. Tinker sprang him, hurried away swiftness deer. The orphan long since taken his flight. But, his great joy, he received brave negro his coin, he prized more--his flute. CHAPTER LXVII. MR.

"We shall careful, captain," said latter. "Of course," said Deering, merry twinkling his eye; "you always are." "Always." "There is much fear, captain," said Jack, lightly. "Oh, yes, is," responded Deering, quickly, "very much." "How?" "Why, little provoke Mussulman he deal Christian." "But one would indelicate enough show want respect religious scruples," answered Harry. "I do not see interfere all," said Jack. "Why question religion raised?" "Not you," returned Captain Deering, "but them, time unite fall upon unlucky Christian opposed Mussulman dispute, Turk choose invoke aid unbelievers, stigmatise Christians." "Well, captain," said Jack, jibbed lectured, "you need fear us; shall careful enough." "No doubt, Master Jack," returned captain, drily.

Jack Harry taken orphan protection since his narrow escape trial he passed bashaw, hearing orphan description Turk he bought his dress from, resolved pay visit. In bazaar Turks, Greeks, Armenians, Arabs, motley collection coloured people. The Turkish dealers sat stalls, pushing trade taciturn manner, speaking little, true, make remark, tell lies earnest gravity wares. "If could speak Turkish glibly Mr. Figgins," said Harry Girdwood, "you go cheapen fez me, Jack." "I could manage that, Harry," replied Jack. "No, no," said Harry; "remember poor orphan suffered buying his Turkish dress." "Bother that," returned Jack. "Let us go lark chap selling slippers." "Be careful." There several slipper vendors present. Jack picked pair slippers inquired price. The dealer gave odd look. Jack looked round Harry Girdwood assistance. "I cannot help you," returned Harry. "Ask again." "What is figure, old Turkey rhubarb?" asked Jack, bowing paying merchant compliment. The Turk replied gravity. "He do not appear understand," said Harry Girdwood. "Try St. Giles's Greek?" "What is damage brace trotter boxes, old Flybynight?" demanded young Harkaway, looking solemn judge. The Turkish merchant repeated price his native tongue, made progress deal. While thus engaged, come bazaar Nat Cringle, old friend Irish diver? "I will put him. Mayhap he will understand me. What illigant ould thafe is," said diver, he waited time reply. "Why do not ye answer, ye dirrty ould spalpeen?" he demanded, pause. "Be gorra, av ye do not sphake, I will give ye one wid twig." Saying which, he flourished his shillelagh slipper merchant's face, gave smart tap his head. The grave old Turk found his tongue, reply startler, four travellers knocked moral equilibrium.

The Turk inward struggle, he confessed. He Irishman, settled years Turkey. "But devil word must ye say. Ye'll spoil shop entirely," he said, "av folks hereabout takes Christian gintleman, I shall kilt intirely." CHAPTER LXVIII. PADDY MAHMOUD PLAYS THE PASHA--LOCAL STATISTICS--VISIT TO THE KONAKI--HOSPITALITY VERSUS AL KORAN. The Irish Turk contrived, talk, friends procure entry palace pasha. "Back stairs infloonce, boys," said Irish Turk, wink, "is illigant institooshn, jist privlint here, sorrs, St. James's castle." "How work it?" "I particular pals, shall nameless, pasha's palace." "Officers?" The Irish Turk looked demure replied-- "Not exactly officers; officeresses, ye understand." "You are terrible Turk, Paddy," laughed young Jack. "When shall able get palace?" demanded Harry Girdwood. "Come course to-morrow afternoon," said Irish Turk. "We will." * * * * This arranged, strolled bazaar, trading bartering dealers, making odd collection purchases, take home curiosities. But curiosities, remarkable perhaps pair real Egyptian mummies, discovered possession shrewd greedy old Arab. "We shall quite extensive museum," said Jack. "Blessed I care see brace stiff uns board," growled Nat Cringle. "We shall present take board," said Jack; "we shall first take rooms. We shall find use mummies, eh, Harry?" "I believe you, boy," said Harry. "We will name mummies Mole orphan. Ha, ha!" Well, afternoon, agreed upon, young Jack Harry Girdwood presented residence Irish Turk, Paddy Mahmoud Ben Flannigan, boys christened him. They got _à la Turc_. Tinker his attendant Bogey also suitably attired. They found Irishman seated upon floor his legs him. He arose guests entered, advanced greet politely. "Make home, gentlemen," he said, "and say what will ye take get along." Jack tipped wink his companion. "I would like little nip something cure belly-ache," he answered slily. "Ye same," responded host. He went cupboard, produced stumpy, capacious bottle, three glasses. "Whatever that?" said Harry, affected surprise. "A drop crater," responded Paddy Mahmoud, pouring out. "Here is health," said Harry Girdwood. The two lads nodded host, sipped. The Irish Turk tossed his whisky gulp. "When shall ready go palace?" asked Jack. "All good time," returned host. "In first place, called palace." "What then?" "The Konaki." "Konaki!" "That is it. Now I will show exactly conduct presented court," he said. Three servants entered, carrying three pipes, size, jewelled amber mouth-pieces. The servants drew like automatons, placing his right hand his heart. The next moment inhaling first draught wonderful tobacco, host keeping traditional Turkish custom puffing half minute guests. When puffed away silence little time, servants returned. One carried crimson napkin, richly embroidered gold, thrown his left shoulder. And others carried coffee tray, upon cups elegant filagree work. Each guests presented cup coffee--not nice according notions, thick, unstrained unsweetened. Yet Turks considered people really understand art making coffee. This disposed of, servants retired. "Now," says host, "that is ye'll go Konaki, be, speak, presented court. When go visiting his excellency pasha business, matter pressing may be, must not speak pipes coffee got through. You observe little customary bit etiquette, go merrily marriage bell." "Have ever seen pasha yourself?" asked Jack. "Often." "What is he like?" "Every inch gentleman." This rather surprised them. "Now let us come off, shall see Konaki." CHAPTER LXIX. THE JOYS OF THE SERAGLIO--A GROUP OF PEEPING THOMASES--THE CIRCASSIAN SLAVES--TINKER AND BOGEY ARE IN FOR IT--THE ALARM--ATTEMPTED RESCUE--AWAY WITH THEM--THE IRISHMAN TELLS A FEW WHITE ONES TO A PURPOSE. The slipper merchant selected favourable moment visit Konaki. The pasha--or speak correctly, pasha's deputy, deputy imposed upon poor orphan--was absent house temporarily, able walk whither listed, thanks backstairs influence friend guide boasted. The head pasha's household person owed unusual privilege. There great deal see Konaki there, visit would probably cut short attracted sounds distant music upon point leaving. "What is that?" said Jack. "That is seraglio," returned conductor; "some Circassian girls sent present pasha clever dancers, said." Jack pricked his ears this. "Come on," he said, moving forward briskly. "To seraglio?" "Aye." "Why, rash boy," said Irish Turk, frightened look, "do know talking about?" "Well, yes, I think so," said Jack; "dancing Circassian girls seraglio topic conversation, unless I wandering mind." "Faith, ye must mad," said Irishman, gravely; "why, they would think hanging good man even looked harem." "So I," returned Jack; "I have wish hanged; it is good me. Come on." "Do not foolish; it is death, we are caught." "All right," said Jack, cheerfully; "it is sure must not caught, I do not mean miss chance same." The Irishman resisted stoutly. But Jack obstinate he was, Irishman forced yield point. "I know there is gallery overlooks harem, see fun fair without observed." "You seem know place well," said Jack. "Very." "But course never identical gallery before?" said Jack, innocently. "Never--never." His eagerness impress upon told tale. "I think that is true, Jack," said Harry, demurely. "Oh, yes, quite," said Jack, winking Harry. The Irishman led way along paved passage, end arched entrance apartment, closed heavy curtain. "You see curtain?" whispered guide. "Yes." "That is harem." "Come on, then," said Jack, eagerly. "Stop, stop!" exclaimed Irishman. "The side curtain two----" Before he could complete sentence, curtain dragged aside, two armed negroes appeared. Their appearance sudden startling. Each carried drawn sword, scimitar formidable size. They looked ugly customers would wish see. "Two eunuchs," whispered Irishman, "they guarding seraglio. Come away." "Ugly enough heathen gods," whispered Harry Girdwood. The two eunuchs stood like statues guard. The slipper merchant said something Turkish appeared satisfy them. "Massa Jack," whispered Tinker, one party, tugging his young master's sleeve, "Massa Jack." "What now?" "Dat one ob de beasts chuck de pusson de water alive de sack, sar." "What!" ejaculated Harry Girdwood. "Fack, Massa Harry," said Tinker, stoutly. "Guess I know dat ugly brack niggar, sar, tousan' mile off--beast!" "Come on. Do not appear notice them," said Irishman. "It is awkward work now. If half suspicion, would drop us right left, leave limb either one blessed bodies." He led way came gallery overlooked seraglio. Their leader warned keep silent. In chamber dozen Turkish ladies, unveiled. They gorgeously attired, lolling indolent attitudes, life indescribable bore them. Upon square fringed carpet middle room Circassian girl rare beauty perfect symmetry gliding graceful dance, low, melodious measure, another girl her country chanting. The dance resembled nothing Jack Harry seen before. As she turned round, shawl she waved made describe series circles. And then, she came sudden stop, fell around her graceful folds she looked like beautiful sculptured figure. But could fairly admire her graceful form beauteous face, she bounded mazy dance, intense gratification idle lookers-on. "What think that?" whispered Irishman. "Lovely," returned Jack, enthusiastically. "Beautiful," added Harry Girdwood. "What would little Emily say, Jack, she knew looking loving eyes little beauty?" The mention little Emily's name made Jack silent minute two. Presently he asked-- "Are professional performers?" "The dancer singer two three Circassian slaves sent pasha present his journey. He pleased new acquisition he returns, although one met untimely end." "Slaves! Is possible?" said young Jack. "Rather, boy." "What slaves?" "Various things. Perhaps keep amuse ladies harem, see now; perhaps make beasts burden; perhaps make wives them. His excellency particular wife two." "He is beast!" said young Jack; "and I like kick him." "Gently, gently; it is system country, dear boys, nothing more." "But," said Jack, "when speak Circassian girl sent present pasha, mean real pasha deputy? For Turk one cheated poor orphan his money." "This deputy; I mean pasha himself," returned Irish Turk. "The deputy would like appropriate slaves himself." "Do think so?" "I know it, he mind would call murder then." "Perhaps would account saw bay, horrible business sack." "More likely," said Irish Turk, gravely. "But slave, less, even it is lovely girl, does not count much parts." The boys gave shudder. They used hearing murder discussed cold-blooded fashion. "Tinker," said Jack, way changing topic suddenly, "do think Bogey could dance like girl?" "Go an' dance like dat," he said contemptuously. "Me an' dat nigger dance lot better, sar. Bogey!" "Wall!" "Over wid you." And then, surprise dismay rest, two darkeys vaulted balustrade dropped room beneath. Had bombshell fallen midst ladies harem, could surprised. There half-stifled shriek one, flew corner, stood huddled together protection. But Tinker his man put strange demonstrations upon part ladies. "Bogey." "Yes, Massa Tinker." "We will jest take floor togeder show dem female gals de poetry motion like." "Yah, yah!" grinned Bogey; "go it, hunkey boy." And go it. There much poetry motion it, dance breakdown genus. And tell truth, ladies appeared frightened pleased darkeys' extraordinary evolutions. The double shuffle excited wonderment. When Bogey Tinker brought respective hoofs bang, great alarm manifested. By degrees, however, appeared grow accustomed eccentric evolutions young negroes, presently one laughed aloud quaint capers boys cutting. This set laughing, mirth ladies height, certain alarming sounds heard without. "By holy fly," ejaculated Irishman. "there is row house, frisky black boys'll lose lives do not watch it." "What is matter?" demanded young Jack. "The deputy-pasha back," whispered Irishman, evident anxiety. "He discovered presence strangers house. He is coming along his guards, there will devil pay." "What, Tinker Bogey?" "They are dead door-nails. There unwritten law sentences man death violates sanctity Turkish harem." "Why do not run out?" inquired Harry, anxiously. "What for? To cutdown armed eunuchs. No; better take chance are." "I am going leave die," said Jack; "I will shy, it, if----" "Hold tongue," interrupted Irishman, anxiously; "but look, dooce girls black boys?" Tinker Bogey laboured great disadvantage. They could neither understand make understood fair creatures surrounded. However, managed glean danger, temporary safety found inner room beyond curtain facing chief entrance, guarded two eunuchs. They bustled apartment ladies harem chorus excited whisperings. "Whatever going do?" whispered Jack. "Silence, word. Look there!" said Irish Turk. The heavy drapery chief entrance drawn aside, marched fierce-looking Turk, tried rob orphan his cash-box, closely followed two eunuchs, stood sentry doorway. "Now, there will devil pay," whispered Irishman. Osmond, ruling bashaw time, heard strangers within palace, he hurried speed. When first he apprised this, his greed excited him, chief sweets his office presents. The deputy-pasha ready accept many he could send. "Strangers present," he exclaimed, addressing one favourite ladies; "now, beard Prophet, intruders shall suffer!" "What intruders?" said lady. The deputy-governor made towards curtain. But he could enter, lady he talking placed herself his way. "Stand aside----" "Restrain temper here," returned lady; "his excellency would pleased hear this." These words appeared cool ferocity deputy-governor little. "Let strangers come forth then," he growled. "It shall done." She passed chamber. A moments later curtain dragged aside, two fair Circassians came forth, leading veiled girl hand. Strapping girls too; closely veiled impossible see features like. "Were strangers?" "Yes." The deputy-governor glared new-comers, dismissed Circassian girls. They refused go first, upon he grew rabid anger. "Your sister Selika opposed wishes once," he said, cruel significance; "she never oppose more. Begone!" They tremblingly obeyed tyrant. This done, he sent two armed eunuchs wave hand. * * * * "What is now, I wonder?" whispered Jack. "Wait." The Irishman odd suspicion. And his suspicion soon realised. * * * * "Remove veil," said Osmond, deputy-pasha, peremptorily. But he might well addressed stone wall. The tyrant waited moment. Then he seized one girls dragged her aside, tearing her veil he so, and-- Oh, roar. A wild ejaculation disgust escaped him, face veil black. Black night, huge, saucer-like eyes, huge mouth wearing grin alarming. "Yah, yah! do not like me, old man? Tink I you? Yah, yah!" And Tinker stood his tongue out, grinning fierce Turk. The deputy-governor, enraged, made rush poor Tinker, gave spiteful, undignified back hander. "Golly!" cried Tinker. "Cantankerous immense beast, old Turkey." "Oh!" Just tyrant greeted stinging spank side his face, turning round, another negress--as he thought. Or same? It looked identical face form. "Yah, yah!" grinned Bogey. The deputy-governor looked round puzzled air. "Yah, yah!" grinned Bogey, again. "Yah, yah!" shouted Tinker, poking his fist ribs Turk, nearly doubling up. The Turk heard derisive laugh, he felt tingling his ear poke his ribs. So he dashed Bogey first. Bogey feinted dodged him. But his petticoats got his legs, he went sprawling. The Turk sprang him, Tinker there, goodness knows would result. But Tinker much there. He bobbed his head shot straight forward, landing his deputy-excellency fairly stomach, his bare woolly pate. "Ugh!" gasped Turk, he went. Bogey sooner saw he hammered Turk's figure-head violent ungentlemanly way. Jack Harry Girdwood laughed tears ran cheeks. "Begorra," whispered Irishman, "it is better pantomime, us suffer." * * * * But end adventure promised serious. The fierce Turk grew frightened, he called assistance. In came armed eunuchs ready slaughter. "Good-bye boys," said Irishman, whisper. "Not I know it," returned Jack; "I am scene, old man." "I am you, Jack," cried Harry. Jack danger. Over went Harry help him. The fierce Turk filled wonder dismay; enemies appeared drop clouds. "Now, old big bags," said young Jack, saucily, "come on, see Boy England fight." The words intelligible Turks, gesture thoroughly understood. There gong-bell close beside deputy-pasha, one tap sufficed bring whole mob armed men room. "Seize Franks!" exclaimed tyrant, still holding his hands round his sides pain; "they earned fate. Let swift. Away them--oh, I nearly killed--away them!" They resisted stoutly enough, fought like tiger-cats; use? None whatever. The Irishman waited hear ugly order given anent bowstringing, he came stairs, made his way artfully (so his presence gallery overlooking seraglio might suspected) corridor, he discovered two armed eunuchs guard, looking like ebony statues again, calm never taken part short stirring scene described. "I wish see his excellency pasha," said he, "for I came conducting two young Englishman, great distinction, brought rich presents his excellency." One men went in, brought tyrant. To Irishman repeated his tale extravagant show respect deference. "Are two Franks?" demanded Turk. He gave word he spoke, seraglio marched Jack Harry Girdwood, arms tightly bound sides, strong escort armed men. "Yes, excellency," answered Irishman. "Then there," returned deputy-pasha; "you know means?" "They erred ignorance, excellency." "Then," replied Turk, vindictive significance, "within hour grow wiser. Away them!" And prisoners marched away. "Begorra," muttered Irishman himself, "it is up." But he never relaxed his efforts this. "Pardon, O excellency," he said, "but young gentlemen offended ignorance, princes royal blood Britain, continued absence lead inquiries, and----" "They shall die like dogs kings," growled deputy-pasha. "Let entreat humbly wait return his excellency, Franks savages, least slight, even princes, would bring ships war along coast; town would razed ground." "Ships war!" responded deputy-pasha. "Yes, excellency," continued Irishman, frightened air, seeing slight advantage he got now, "the ship came nearing coast. It well within range, cruel engines war barbarians use. I tremble Konaki." "They would never dare----" "Pardon, would dare thing. The death two princes blood royal would signal first shot, good-bye us all." The deputy-pasha paused. The Irishman eyed askance. "Begorra!" he muttered himself, "that ought sthrong enough him. Them boys made tell enough lies ten minutes last Turk lifetime. Be jabers, I have pitched sthrong purpose. He hesitates lost. He thinking better it." The Irishman right. "I reflect," said Turk, dignified air; "I may spare lives, possibly await return his highness pasha." The Irishman dismissed. He bowed retired. CHAPTER LXX. OSMOND AND LOLO THE SLAVE--THREATS AND DEFIANCE--THE CIRCASSIAN'S DOOM--OSMOND EARNS HIS REWARD. The three Circassian slaves sent present real pasha, Osmond's master, friendly Algerian prince, and, arriving absence pasha, deputy cast greedy eyes upon rich prize. Finding his authority lost upon Circassians girls, stoutly refused persuaded, he grew vicious. Nothing positively known, tragedy Jack Harry Girdwood witnessed hard water-gate Konaki, coupled recognition two eunuchs Tinker two assassins he Bogey capsized water, made matters look altogether suspicious indeed. The threatening words Osmond muttered one fair Circassians, too, told tale. The Circassian girls endeavoured screen luckless negroes, Tinker Bogey, led boys presence Osmond disguised girls? Here, then, pretext ill-usage unfortunate slaves. The girls brought tyrant's presence. "Stand out, deceitful faithless slave," he said, addressing one girls; "you accused treason pasha, know fate." The girl addressed made reply bold, defiant glance. "You die," said Osmond, watching effect his words he spoke. The girls move utter word. "You know power," he went say low tone. "You one chance life yet; would know is?" He waited answer. He waited vain. The proud Circassian girls deign notice him. "You remember I told sister?" he said. "Reconsider I said, may yet late." "We need speak again," returned one girls. "What already said resolve." "Death!" hissed Turk, his teeth. He eagerly watched terror his words produced. "Sooner death ten hundred times," returned Circassian proudly, "than acknowledge master." "You spoken," exclaimed Turk, fiercely. He struck bell, one armed eunuchs entered. "Remove slaves cells I told you; remain nightfall. You understand me?" The man placed his finger upon his lip--a sign implicit obedience--and Circassian slaves removed prison. They doomed. Another tragedy planned--the sequel Harry Girdwood young Jack witnessed almost soon upon Turkish coast. The cord sack play part. And could nothing avert fate? Their peril extreme--greater even English lads faithful followers, Tinker Bogey. * * * * "This pretty go," said Harry Girdwood, dolefully, he looked round him. His tone grumpy, his look glum, Jack could refrain laughing. "Grumbling old sinner," said he; "you are never satisfied." "Well, I like that," said Harry. "You get us precious hobble sheer wanton foolery, expect like it." "Now, do not get waxy," said Jack. Tinker Bogey understand full extent danger. They sat end chamber, grinning masters, and, truth told, rather enjoying dilemma honoured sharing them. Their masters would sure pull safely. Such idea. As soon left alone prison, boys made survey, Jack pronounced his opinion, his determination old air confidence himself. "They are treating us something like contempt, Harry," he said. "How so?" "By guarding us better this," reply. "I do not quite see that, Jack; door would take us time get through." "Perhaps," returned Jack, "but look window, tell think that?" The window, perhaps better said hole wall--for glass lattice none--overlooked sea. They part Konaki known water pavilion. There drop thirty feet water. Thirty feet. Just think thirty feet is. About height two-story dwelling house. "Supposing get there," said Harry Girdwood, "we never able swim way friendly ship. "My dear old wet blanket," returned Jack, "I got mess, I will get it." "I hope so." They watched anxiously friendly ship. At length vigil rewarded success. A big ship sailed bay British colours flying her masthead. They almost shouted joy sight. "That is deuce way off," said Harry Girdwood. "About mile." "A mile precious good swim," grunted Harry. "So much better. These villainous old Turks will not suspicious, mile is not much either us, I think. I do not mind it, answer Tinker his prime minister." "Dat's so," said Bogey, grinning ear ear. "Yah, yah! Me Tinker swim Massa Harry Jack backs." At dusk matured plan action. Tinker could float water like cork, swiftest swimmer four. Tinker was, therefore, lowered far could manage, allowed drop water. It drop! "Fought dis chile gwine dropping week, sar," said plucky young nigger, subsequently. However, he surface, got his wind well, he darted water like fish. They watched his dusky form could see more. "Now, Bogey." "Ready, sar." He lowered dropped Tinker, speedily upon latter's track. "Now turn," said Jack. "I shall go header." "Do not," said Harry. "You would never come alive went head first height." And Jack dissuaded purpose. He squeezed his body aperture. "Give hand, Harry, I look over." His comrade obeyed, Jack able see him. Now his left, ten feet down, large doorway, flap similar doors water-side warehouses, London, stores lowered raised barges means iron crane. "I wonder place is?" said Jack; "if I could reach it, fall would considerably broken." He try. They fastened two scarves together, Harry, making secure hold above, lowered Jack, latter swinging backwards forwards twice, dropped second time fairly ledge. It perilous hold. But Jack second Nero monkey tricks, he held tenacious manner. Swinging he pushed his way dark gloomy place. A low vaulted chamber, dimly lighted flickering old lamp. "Where I now?" Before he could look get answer question, he startled sound footsteps. What he do? Leap out? Or he wait? He decided wait. He crept corner, darkest he could find, there, beating heart, he awaited progress events. He long wait. Two dusky forms glided spectrally place, one bearing lamp. With this, looked about, Jack, sinking heart, recognised two eunuchs again. "What devilment working now?" thought Jack. They flashed light upon objects search. Two huge sacks lay upon floor. Jack imperfectly discerned were; sickening dread stole him, two eunuchs raised one sacks floor, bearing window, contents writhed struggled desperately, hurled out. A stifled groan. A shriek. A splash. Jack could hear more. He dart his hiding-place upon black-hearted wretches, third person stepped chamber. He said something two men--a sharp words authoritative tone--and retired. Jack recognised voice instant. It Osmond. "What he now?" muttered Jack, himself. A scene intense excitement followed. The Turk unfastened cord fastened neck second sack, dragged open. Then, raising sack end, he proceeded hastily drag down, revealing dim light well-remembered form one Circassian girls. "Lolo," said Osmond, "I come give one last chance." "I defy despise you!" said girl. "Reflect." "I have." "You know well, I seen looks, I hate you----" "Would love murderer sister?" "Silence, slave!" "I fear menaces," retorted brave girl; "you must seen that. The triumph now--mine come." "When?" "Hereafter. Murder creed mine. Do worst." Jack listened. Osmond seized girl wrist. But she twisted free his clutch without particular effort. Thereupon Turk, growl rage, drew his sword, would cut her down. But Jack could stand more. Bounding forward his hiding-place, he seized uplifted hand wrenched sword his grasp. Then, without word, Jack struck man flat his sword upon back head. The Turk sank ground hollow groan. It momentary beautiful Circassian girl looked one dream. Hearing footsteps now, Jack ran doorway peered out. "Quick!" exclaimed Jack. "Lend hand, lost." She could understand his words, his meaning plain enough. They pulled body sack quickly possible. Then hastily tied cord around neck it. This done, Jack extinguished lamp. There time lost. He took girl hand, pulled her back nook he hiding, two villainous eunuchs entered chamber. The two eunuchs came slowly along corridor. Finding place, thought, deserted, simply raised sack ground, thinking body young Circassian girl it, bore opening. One swing went. As fell, hollow groan came sack. The two men stared aghast, looked opening. But could utter word, stealthy form crept behind them, vigorous drive, hurled sack. A wild, despairing yell, waters closed wholesale butchers. CHAPTER LXXI. LOLO'S GRATITUDE AND JACK'S DELIGHT--THE SIGNAL--UNEXPECTED TURN OF LUCK--A FAMILIAR VOICE--WHO IS IT?--"SURELY! NEVER!"--READ AND LEARN. "That is good job done!" said Jack, looking wretches he pushed over. The fair Circassian burst tears peril over. Falling upon her knees, she seized Jack's hands pressed her lips. She poured long string thanks eloquent language. Although language far wasted upon Jack, he could fail comprehend her meaning. "There, there," said Jack, squeezing her hand reply her caresses, "do not take so, dear girl. The danger's now." But it? They yet get away. Jack worse his prison ten feet higher up, true. But Lolo? How she manage? While he cogitating he heard shrill whistle below. He ran window. "Hist, Jack!" cried familiar voice water. "Hullo!" "Drop down, Jack," returned Harry's voice. "Here I am, boat, snug domestic pest railway wrapper." Comic tragic jumbled startling series adventures, Jack scarce knew whether laugh cry. He neither. There rope close, handy upon sack--its destination certainly save life--and Jack, quickness thought itself, fastened around Circassian girl's waist. She understood his meaning, lent assistance she could. Once window, he fastened securely, proceeded lower down. She looked dizzy height, slightly shuddered. And then, trusting herself down, she threw her arms around her young preserver's neck, embraced tenderly. "Bless you," said Jack, emotion. "If I bring safe this, proudest day life." Now it. It perilous moment, poor girl could help herself way. But she lowered safety. "Look out," said Jack, good loud whisper; "I am coming now." "Look sharp, then," called Harry. "I smell danger." "Make haste, dear boy," added familiar voice. The sound thrilled Jack strangely. He full present adventure perils, he could give much thought voice now. Yet rang his ears old days. "You are nearly down," said Harry Girdwood. "Drop now, old fellow." Jack obeyed. As soon he reached boat, he seized arms Circassian girl, Lolo, hugged she would never part again. "Now, love," said familiar voice, "when you have done boy, I like one touch him. What say, Jack, lad?" "Heaven above!" ejaculated Jack "Why, it is Mr. Mole." "Right, dear boy," returned Mr. Mole. "Isaac Mole himself, turned nick time. God bless you, Jack." "And you, too, sir. How home? My mother, my----" "There, there," interrupted Harry; "we will family history we are fairly musket-shot range. If find thing, they will pot us easily shooting nuts fair." "All right," said Jack, laughingly. "Pull away." "Pull away, boys." "Aye, aye, sir." They good boatload, yet moved water pretty smartly. * * * * The vessel anchored bay, showed British ensign her masthead, identical ship old friend Mr. Mole come in. The messages sent back different stations upon journey successful guiding Mr. Mole aright, happily enough. They barely cast anchor, Mr. Mole lowered boat, his intention come ashore, get information, possible, regarding object his cruise. But little he think picking his information water. Yet case. When half-way shore, came upon Bogey swimming swiftly along. A words hurried explanation sufficed, astounded Mole boat pulled flush beneath windows Konaki, first rescuing Harry Girdwood Lola Circassian girl, Jack, described. CHAPTER LXXII. THE PICNIC--FIGGINS AGAIN IN TROUBLE. After Jack placed beautiful girl safety, he arranged Mr. Mole tell news home. "Your dear father mother woeful state you, Jack," said Mole. "Why?" asked young Jack. "I do not like beginning reproaches, boy," returned Mr. Mole, "but I must, course, tell you. Your little extravagances troubling father great deal." "I throw light subject," replied Jack. "I robbed. Cheques stolen book, signature forged." Mr. Mole looked grave. "Is fact?" he asked. "Of course. However, need go now. Give news. How Emily?" "Very well health, spirits low--sighing her Jack," said Mole, wickedly. "Did she tell so?" demanded Jack. "Not exactly, I see far stone wall people." "Yes, sir, I believe can," said Jack. "That limit powers observation." "Ha, ha!" laughed Mr. Mole. "But I know comfort Emily, dear girl. She will quite resigned prolonged absence she gets news you. I already written home explain odd circumstances I met you--that shut dark room lovely Circassian girl, subsequently rescued her, fond lovely Circassian seems, and----" "I wish would meddle affairs concern you, Mr. Mole," said Jack, stiffly. "I do not want furnish information body movements." "Very good," replied Mr. Mole, "I will not, then. I thought I might send second letter, say I quite sure care fig lovely Circassian." Jack thought might desirable move, he tried square matters bit. "Do so, I friend," he said. "Consider done," exclaimed Mole. "I like I did, do, father, I must joke." * * * * The perilous adventures friends encountered expedition deter enterprises. Only two days events recorded, Jack's party set picnic excursion, examine beauties surrounding neighbourhood. It towards desert directed steps time, opposite direction. Mr. Figgins, upon journey, showed his usual talent getting scrapes. On passing group fine fig-trees, nothing would suit he must stand upon his mule's saddle order reach fruit. As he still high enough this, he made spring caught one lower branches, he clung. Suddenly mule, know because, bolted underneath, leaving luckless orphan suspended. Mr. Figgins soon relinquished search his anxiety his safety. He saw beneath descent ten feet, bottom dense bed stinging nettles. How he get down? Dropping question, would like leap certain torture. However, Harkaway called hold on, loudly Figgins bawled help. Meanwhile, Bogey Tinker started escaped mule, found difficulty capturing. When length secured, animal placed his former position tree, firmly held two negroes. "Now let down, Figgins," cried Jack; "drop straight steady." Figgins tried his best obey. When he let go branch, rebounded force threw perpendicular, instead landing upon mule's back, he fell landed bed stinging nettles. The orphan roared lustily--as indeed well he might--for, besides shaken fall, pain he soon felt every portion his frame exposed nettles excruciating. When party emerged forest, scene unusual beauty broke upon vision. "This charming spot," observed Harkaway. "And thing picnic," added Harry. "I vote halt trees begin operations." Hampers unpacked, bottles uncorked, application made pure stream water flowed near spot. At length ready. Poor orphan, first mouthful he took seemed consist cayenne pepper. The cup water, he naturally applied relief, also appeared tampered with, tasted salt briny ocean itself. Next, also naturally, he drew forth his pockethandkerchief, ere he could carry his mouth, dropped haste cry horror, contained enormous frog, which, struggles escape, fell plump his plate. Mr. Mole laughed loudly, whereat Mr. Figgins naturally offended schoolmaster, began suspect he playing practical jokes upon him. Bogey Tinker, real promoters orphan's discomfiture, observed great inward mirth, soon afterwards got little trouble themselves. Harkaway, turning suddenly round, discovered two black imps making sad havoc sweets. "You young scoundrels," shouted Jack, angrily grasping his riding-whip; "take fingers jam pot immediately." "I on'y a-openin' it, sar, ready de company," exclaimed unabashed Tinker. "What is hand, Bogey?" proceeded Harkaway, alluding something darkey hiding suspiciously behind him. "Only bit bread I brought pocket, sar," reply. "Show us, then, directly, sir." Bogey accordingly produced crust apparently loaf week last, so, Jack's sharp eyes detected nigger dropped eatable, his hurried endeavour ram his pockets unseen. "There, large currant raspberry tart!" exclaimed Harkaway. "You artful monkey. I owe one this, I mean pay now." Darting them, Jack managed give Bogey Tinker cut shoulders his whip nimbly scampered off, bellowing though murdered. But rapid action, Nero saw opportunity whereof he took advantage, he pounced upon well-bitten tart, bore away triumph. This episode, however, soon forgotten, Mole began relate adventures would done credit Baron Munchausen, Figgins, outdone, told wonderful stories high life he personally engaged. CHAPTER LXXIII. OF THE DEADLY QUARREL AND MORTAL COMBAT BETWEEN MOLE AND FIGGINS. "One day," began Mr. Figgins, pause, "I driving along Belgravia Crescent Lord--bless me!  them it?" "Perhaps Lord Elpus," suggested Harkaway. "Or Lord Nozoo?" said Girdwood. "Are sure he lord all, Mr. Figgins?" asked Mole, dubiously. "Mr. Mole," said orphan, indignantly; "do doubt veracity?" "Not bit," answered schoolmaster, "but I doubt _voracity_ hearers sufficient _swallow_ telling us." "Well, gentlemen," pursued Figgins, turning Mole disgust, "this Lord Whatshisname used behind his carriage nicest little tiger ever seen----" "Nothing like tiger I saw Bengal one day, I am sure," broke Mr. Mole, loud positive tone. "Come, Figgins, I will bet ten one it." The orphan rose his feet great indignation. "Isaac Mole, Esq., I borne patiently injuries almost great mortal man throughout day. I consider insulted you, I satisfaction." "Well, old boy, mention satisfy you, I will see," said Mole. "Nothing short full complete apology." "You do not get me," schoolmaster scornfully retorted. "Preposterous. What I, Isaac Mole, took degree B. A. almost infantine age thirty-four, apologise one is----" "Who what, sir?" demanded Figgins. "Never mind. I do not want use unbecoming expressions," said Mole. "You would not like hear I going say." The orphan angry that, unheeding he doing, he drank nearly tumblerful strong sherry once. This, coming top libations, made whole scene dance his bewildered eyes. He began see two Moles, shook his fist, he thought, upon once. "I d--do not care either you," he exclaimed, fiercely. "Either us? For me, I suppose mean?" said tutor. "Which you?" asked Figgins. "Which who?" retorted Mole. "Why, two you, I wa--want know right one," said Figgins. "I am right one. I always right," said Mole, aggressively. "You do not dare imply I am wrong, you?" "Will not say I imply," answered Figgins, dignity; "but I know a----" "Stop, stop, gentlemen," cried Jack. "Let discord interrupt harmony festive occasion. Mr. Mole, please tone violence language. Mr. Figgins, calm agitation, give us song." "A song?" interrupted Mr. Mole, taking request himself. "Oh, pleasure." And he struck one his favourite bacchanalian chants-- "Jolly nose, Jolly nose, Jolly nose! The bright rubies garnish thy tip Are sprung mines Canary, Are sprung----" "There is doubt upon sprung anyhow," whispered Harkaway Girdwood. "Stop, stop, Mr. Mole," he cried juncture. "It Mr. Figgins, you, called upon song." "Was it?" said schoolmaster. "Very good; beg pardon. Only thought you would prefer somebody could sing. Figgins cannot." Figgins looked Mole, he fly him. But cry "A song, song Mr. Figgins!" drowned his remonstrances. "Really do'no sing, ladies gen'l'men," protested Figgins. "Stop minute. I used know 'My Harp Flute.'" "You mean 'My Heart Lute,' I suppose?" said Jack. "Yes, that is it. And I remember air, I had not forgotten words. Let us see. Stop minute, head's rather queer. Try water cure." Whereupon Mr. Figgins staggered adjacent brook, and, kneeling down, fairly dipped his head it. After wiped dinner napkin he rejoined party, much refreshed. "Tell what, friends, I will give solo flute," he said. "Something lively; 'Dead March Saul' variations." And without mere ado, he took his favourite instrument, prepared astonish company. If Mr. Figgins succeed astonishing company, he least considerably astonished himself, he placed flute his lips gave vigorous preliminary blow, he fail elicit musical sound, he smothered half-blinded dense cloud flour, tube entirely filled. Bogey Tinker, usual, real authors new atrocity, Figgins felt convinced guilt lay door Mole, he turned vengeance. "Villain!" he cried, "this another tricks; it is last straw. I will bear longer; take that." As Mr. Figgins spoke, he struck venerable Mole sounding whack bald part cranium instrument harmony. Mole sprang upon his legs astonishing alacrity, and, seizing Figgins throat, commenced shaking him. A ferocious struggle ensued, among remonstrances spectators, but, could interfere, ended combatants coming heavily full length temporary dinner-table, thereby breaking plates, bottles, glasses. Helped rise seated separate camp-stools, distance apart, two former friends, mortal foes, soon could get breath, sat fiercely shaking fists hurling strong adjectives other. "I will you, old villain!" cried Mole. "And I will you, old rascal!" shrieked Figgins. "We will out," added tutor, "and sooner better. Name place weapons." "Here," answered Figgins, pointing open space him, "and weapon sword." "And mine's pistol," said Mole. "I will fight that, sword." "Agreed," said excited Figgins, quite forgetting impracticability arrangement disadvantages would give him. Figgins battered sabre light curved, Turkish make, Mole rejoiced possession old-fashioned pistol. Mole gave latter Girdwood, volunteered his second, took care put nothing dangerous gunpowder. "Now we are see duel upon quite original principle," cried Jack his friends. "I do not think either hurt much. I will second, Figgins, boy." "All right. I take position here," cried orphan, stationing tree near brook. "I shall stand here," said Mole, stopping half dozen paces him. The orphan looked though he intended bolt behind tree Mole fired. "Well, Master Harry, do not hurry," said Figgins. "I quite ready, you, Mr. Mole?" "Oh yes," said Mole, "I ready." He fully intended blow orphan's head first fire. "I will give signal fire," said Harry. "Now, ready; one, two, three!" Mole's pistol-shot reverberated copse, but, as, matter course, slightest harm Figgins, who, however, thought he heard strike sabre he held position guard. It began, first time, strike orphan novel mode fighting awkward himself, he get his enemy? At first he poised his sword fling him, moved sudden impulse he rushed forward, cry vengeance, began attacking Mole furiously heavy cutting blows. Mole, his resource, dodged caught blows upon his pistol, judging risky work, he took his stick used desperate self-defence; thus dodging parrying, he retreated Figgins advanced. Once Mole managed get Irishman would call "a fair offer" Figgins' skull, accordingly resounded blow his weapon. Half stunned, orphan plunged madly forward took far-reaching aim old tutor. He, his turn, dodged again, his wooden legs nimble real ones, he stumbled tall, thick grass, fell backwards stream. Jack, thinking matters gone far enough, caught orphan's foot rope, bent far forward he overbalanced fell top Mole, tumbled water together. The alarm given, drawn out, "wet drowned rats," quite far gone. They were, however, entirely sobered immersion. A small glass brandy, however, administered each, prevent catching cold, garments taken dry sun. Mole, tutor, Figgins, orphan, wearied exertions, soon fell fast asleep. CHAPTER LXXIV. A TREMENDOUS RISE FOR MR. MOLE. The quarrel two far made up, awoke _siesta_, fumes alcohol subsided, neither seemed remember thing matter. The party got safely home without encountering either robbers, snakes, wolves, thunderstorms, dangerous foes whatever. The next day, however, commenced Mr. Mole adventure outset promised form exciting page his life. He walking streets bazaars town, Jack one side him, Harry other, though reader, first glance, would probably recognised them. Harkaway Girdwood presented appearance Ottoman civilians belonging "Young Turkey" party, whilst venerable tutor stalked along full fig magnificent robed turbaned Turk old school. It become quite mania Isaac turn far he possibly could Moslem. He taken quite naturally Turkish tobacco, national mode smoking chibouque, water-pipe. But outward appearance Mr. Mole certainly succeeded turning Turk, especially he fixed large false grey beard, matched beautifully his green gold turban. He mounted his cork legs, encased his cork feet splendid-fitting patent leather boots, Mole felt happy. "They take pasha three tails, do not think so?" he delightedly asked his companions. "Half dozen tails least, I say," returned Jack, "and course take us couple confidential attendants." "In case, I must walk you, adopt proud demeanour, show superiority," said Mole. So whilst Jack Harry dropped humbly rear, he strode forward haughty stiffness dignity, his two cork legs rather enhanced otherwise. "Holloa!" exclaimed Harry, suddenly; "who is black chap coming us, bowing scraping like mandarin?" He alluded tall dark man, apparently Arab race, dressed full costume Turkish officer, who, dismounting his horse, approached Mole elaborate Oriental obeisances, held folded parchment. Mole took document stiff bow, opened found missive Turkish, which, notwithstanding his studies direction, he could world make out. [Illustration: "MOLE TOOK THE DOCUMENT, AND OPENED IT."--TINKER. VOL. II.] But unembarrassed this, he turned Harry Girdwood, making gesture, indicating his inability read without his spectacles, motioned him. "Good Heavens!" exclaimed Harry, amazement. "It imperial seal Sultan. Mole, old man, mistaken pasha." "Is possible?" cried Mole; "but say?" "Imperial Palace, Stamboul. "In name Allah Prophet. "To his Excellency Moley Pasha. "This certify that, consequence lamented death Youssouf Bey, Pasha Alla-hissar, I commanded sublime master appoint instal said government city province Alla-hissar. Therefore commanded proceed thither, escort readiness door hotel five of the clock morning, receive this. Given Sublime Porte Ali Hussein Pasha, Grand Vizier His Imperial Majesty Padishah." * * * * Mr. Mole turned pale anxiety. "This serious," he exclaimed; "but I fully expect become king I die, case, shall I do?" "Why, become pasha," said Jack; "it worth while. We will give assistance." "But I answer messenger?" asked Mole. "No necessity answer him; make signs obey sultan's mandate; know it." Mole accordingly folded firman again, placed his forehead, his heart, bowing time profound respect. The messenger evidently quite understood, he bowed too, rode away rapidly. "That is call greatness thrust upon you, eh, Mole?" said Jack. "I do not much care it," answered tutor. "I do not believe I shall able carry character pasha. It is dangerous game." "Nonsense," said hero; "if choose make mistake, it is lookout." "I shall find mistake I come bowstringed, hanged, shot, something kind," said tutor; "but, Jack, dear boy, I depend upon pull through." "No fear," answered Jack; "you are great man, Mr. Mole, doubt authorities, becoming aware merits, really made choice governor pashalik." "But must know I am Turk," objected Mole. "That does not matter," said Jack; "not Turks, Greeks, Americans, Italians, French, sorts people power country." The excitement moment influence spirituous liquid he taken starting, far bewildered Mr. Mole's intellect, he actually accepted Jack's explanation. "Hang it, I pasha," he cried; "and risk all. Have not I got sultan's firman?" he flourished important document round his head defiant manner. "That is right," said Jack; "keep spirit, you will make fortune. Remember, first thing to-morrow conducted seat government; guard honour door hotel five of the clock, reach Alla-hissar ten, to-morrow morning you will begin public duties." "What father say, Jack, he hears this? But I hope will not desert me, dear boys," said Mole, imploringly. "We will go you," answered Harry. "Rather!" acquiesced Jack. "We will never leave you, old boy." The remainder day spent Mole study Turkish. These exertions fatiguing, Mr. Mole tired he retired, he expressed it. He long falling asleep, dreams glory, power, magnificence filled his slumbers. He dreaming he elected sultan he suddenly rudely awakened terrible knocking door. Mole started up, told he must prepare great hurry, escort already arrived. The tutor, still half asleep, looked window, day dawn he discerned small body horsemen door hotel. Mole felt he could never get elaborate Turkish robes without assistance; luckily juncture young Jack put opportune appearance, offered help him. "You will make haste, pasha," said hero; "strikes you have rather overslept yourself. Where beard?" "Here is," returned Mole; "but did not wake before? I busy dreaming I sultan, and--that is right, boy, help cork legs boots, that is worst difficulty, things, lastly turban beard." "I will get Harry help me," pursued Jack; "you will proper attendants installed palace. Remember agreed upon last night; pass two sons, names Yakoob Haroun Pasha." "Just so," said Mole; "but I expected larger escort half dozen men there. I would go this, boy, I thought future history would give glorious page." "Oh, do not fear, sir, something grand you; gate town met regular guard honour." With combined assistance Jack Harry, Mole fully invested his Oriental robes, he stumped downstairs gracefully moving bundle clothes. His escort consisted six spahis, black, headed messenger day before. "Jack, dear boy," said Mole, "at last time arrived become great man eyes world." "Right are, sir," replied Jack. "On go, noble pasha." As soon Mole mounted, chief spahi gave word, imposing cavalcade set quick trot. In two hours arrived primitive sequestered town Alla-hissar. CHAPTER LXXV. THE GREAT MOLEY MOLE PASHA. Such important event arrival new governor naturally caused great deal excitement among worthy inhabitants remote town. They came crowds greet him, headed inferior functionaries, military guard honour conducted old castle, fitted sumptuous official residence. Two things puzzled his new subjects; fact his arrival two days appointed time, circumstance new pasha, apparently Turk, returning greetings interpreter. However, none doubt reality his appointment, production sultan's firman made old cadi, magistrate, temporarily put command, give way his superior. Briefly let us explain circumstances. It another hoax, daring gigantic one, part Jack his friends, upon long-suffering tutor. Having ascertained town Alla-hissar actually waiting new governor, real pasha, arrive Constantinople two days' time, Jack others hit upon idea making situation basis grand practical joke. The _firman_ course forged document, written old interpreter, plot, Turkish officer presented Mole friend diver. The waiter, orphan, two nigger boys also effectually disguised themselves, became members Mole's escort. A skilful combination enabled carry details plan success deceive Mole himself, simple pastoral folks Alla-hissar itself. Moley Pasha, he styled himself, his glory. "This proud day," he observed Jack, he gazed round handsome residence provided him. "Little I imagine old Isaac would ever live come glories Oriental magnate. Jack, must let dear father know this." "We will, sir; let us congratulate you," answered hero. "The especially you have promoted us high positions." Moley, pasha, retired his private apartments rest hour arrived his first council. During time, he coached old interpreter, his aid, Moley Pasha found able receive reports congratulations subordinates government, try several cases brought him. After three hours arduous public duties, pasha his friends retired his private apartments, fitted every Oriental luxury. "By Jove!--I mean Prophet!" exclaimed new potentate, "I getting like house fire; I still mortal, need refreshment, anything speak to-day, beyond cup coffee dash brandy it." Dinner served (in Turkish style) pasha grew still enthusiastic. "Yes, delightful life," he said; "it wants presence lovely woman render perfect. Now, Mrs. Mole Number One Number Two Three here----" "Oh, I forgot," suddenly broke Jack, looking serious. "That reminds me, one important subject I speak about. The late pasha thirteen wives." "How awful," exclaimed Mole. "But me?" "A good deal; left, his sudden death, desolate widows, expected you, his sucessor, take protection. They go premises, like stock fixtures business." "Heaven above! do not mean that?" exclaimed Moley Pasha, becoming much agitated, pausing ere he quaffed goblet champagne, he drank name sparkling French sherbet. "It is quite true, though, is not it, Abdullah?" turning dragoman. "It is true Koran, itself," returned Jack. "Every pasha Alla-hissar must thirteen wives." "Good heaven! what will Mrs. Mole say?" exclaimed Mole, great agitation; "hang it, know, never do--Isaac Mole thirteen wives. I always thought I much married already, quite much I want be." "Unless excellency agrees," continued interpreter, "I will not answer consequences." "I three wives already, wish take thirteen. I would sooner resign government once," exclaimed Mole. "Impossible!" returned dragoman; "it death resist sultan's firman." "Powers above! situation I in!" exclaimed Mole, increasing dismay. "I find it is roses all, pasha; thorns, stinging nettles, torturing brambles. But thirteen widows, Abdullah? Who they, like?" "They present house far here," reply; "five them, seems, widows pasha last, rather old; six belonged Youssouf Pasha, middle-aged." Mr. Mole responded deep groan. "The two," proceeded Abdullah, "are fair Circassians summer youth beauty." Moley Pasha uttered profound sigh. "Ah, that is much better." "I expect soon, least them," said Abdullah, interpreter. The subject dropped time, great Moley also dropped--asleep, combined effects pipe, coffee, wine. He suddenly awakened Abdullah shouting his ear-- "May please excellency, they have come." "Who--who?" gasped Mole, fearful terror; he dreaming rack bowstring. "The noble Ladies Alme Hannifar, widows late lamented Youssouf-Pasha," reply. "Gracious mercy!" exclaimed persecuted Mole; "they have come claim me, perhaps bear main force." "Ho, there, guards; stand round; without struggle Isaac Mole surrender his liberty single man, married man, not--Heaven, brain growing utterly confused terrible position. Where is boy Jack?" "Their excellencies Yakoob Haroun Pasha gone out," response. "Then, Abdullah, I command stand defence. Come here." The old interpreter approached low bow. "Write two pieces card words--'Admire Moley Pasha, touch him.'" "In Turkish?" "Turkish English, too." "Pasha, hear obey." At moment young negro attendant announced-- "The Ladies Alme Hannifar impatient admitted sublime presence." "Let wait; good," cried Mole, desperately. "Have written it, Abdullah?" "One moment, highness," reply. "There," he added, finishing elaborate flourish; "all understand that. And I them?" "Fasten one notice back, chest," answered Mole, "so ladies may understand keep respectful distance. That is right. Be still, trembling heart. Now admit them." The negro drew aside curtains chamber, two female forms majestic height proportions, gorgeous Oriental costumes, closely veiled, entered. They made graceful salute pasha, walking straight him, he sprang backwards, leaping upon high sofa, turned his back them, contempt, order might read Turkish inscription thereon inscribed. Then he turned pointed his breast English. Far, however, struck awe covered confusion, ladies highly amused laughed consumedly. "What smiling at?" asked Mole, somewhat indignantly. "Only felicitous ingenuity highness's idea," answered interpreter, pointing placard. "Well, I hope understand, abide it," said Mole, venturing step sofa. But moment he so, foremost, who, he understood Lady Alme, certainly impulsive disposition, sprang forward embrace Mole. "Save me!" he cried. "To rescue, guards, attendants, Jack, Harry. Where got to? Help, help! Mrs. Mole, come rescue poor Mole." The old interpreter, dexterity, flung them, nick time avert Mole fair Circassian's effusive greeting. "It Is Eastern custom," explained dragoman. "Her ladyship expressing her delight beholding her new lord master." "Tell I nothing kind, I got wife England," answered pasha. Abdullah so, whereupon ladies set series piercing shrieks lamentations. "What world's matter them?" asked Mole, greatly dismayed. "They desolated thought incurred sublimity's displeasure." "Tell business come unless I sent them," said Mole. "They say, O magnificent pasha, that, hearing arrival, come thither name themselves, eleven ladies his late highness's harem, know princely pleasure bid cast aside sombre weeds widowhood, and----" "There, cut short, dragoman; mean really expect marry whole lot them?" "Precisely so, eminence; even reverend imaum town ready perform ceremonial." "He will wait long time he waits that," cried Mole; "thirteen wives, indeed, say youngest lot. I suppose objection allow behold moonshine resplendent features. That is way put it, I believe, old man." Abdullah answered-- "It Turkish etiquette unveil solemn ceremony performed; nevertheless, ladyships consent remove one veils, may behold features." Alme Hannifar accordingly threw back outer black veils, appeared white ones underneath. Mole scrutinized well he could, he took good care go near. "And so, Abdullah, tell two youngest whole lot?" "Indeed, are, eminence; famous beauties pure Circassian descent; originally cost five thousand piastres, surpass remainder even mighty sun doth twinkling stars." "Then I say is," returned Mole, "that I shudder think eleven others must like. Just tell ladies Alme Hannifar that, far I see, here, I do not think much them." "I put message mildly." And spoken ladies again, he said-- "Their ladyships enchanted find much favour eyes excellency." "Thirteen wives," mused Mole, scarcely heeding last reply. "It preposterous--though nothing seems, compared Turkish grandees. But fancy old Isaac Mole--ha, ha! really it is quite amusing. Why, mere marrying many would hard day's work, Abdullah." "The ceremony would slightly wearisome, highness." "Yes, I require thirteen wedding rings--ha, ha, ha!--the idea thirteen wedding rings used once, one man." "Do not let objection," said Abdullah; "for ladies tell come provided exactly number rings requisite purpose." Sure enough, Alme detached her fair neck elastic band, whereon strung thirteen bright gold rings. Mole fairly staggered determined preparation part irresistible enslavers. "They mean me," he gasped. "I see is; come intention dragging late pasha's mansion, marrying main force." "It looks like it," answered interpreter, "for I find brought dozen harem-guard, fully armed." "Then I indeed lost," cried Mole. "But no, I will die game. Here, help, guards, soldiers, fly rescue pasha. Oh! Mrs. Mole, now? Your poor Mole danger." As Mole uttered piteous lament recorded, ladies made combined charge him, wild shriek sudden outburst Turkish, might either chorus endearments reproaches. Alme got behind flung her arms around his neck vigour he nearly strangled, Hannifar attacking way front. In pressure combined assault he powerless; struggle he would, he could detach overwhelming embrace. His cries help smothered. His turban knocked his eyes. He could feel placards torn him, hauled hither thither ladies seemed fighting sole possession him. At length, gigantic effort, he freed raised cry alarm might aroused dead, effort, he stumbled fell his back pile sofa cushions. Roused his cries, military body guard pashalik rushed in, whole house uproar. When Mole uplifted his feet, gasping forth confused explanations, he perceived Ladies Alme Hannifar mysteriously levanted. CHAPTER LXXVI. THE SUDDEN RUIN AND UTTER DOWNFALL OF THE GREAT MOLEY PASHA. The ladies' absence great relief Mole. He devoutly hoped he ever got rid thirteen widows his late lamented predecessor. About hour afterwards, Mole striving calm his irritated feelings cup coffee hookah, Jack Harry arrived, said, walk round neighbouring country, looking innocent lambs may met finely-grassed hills. This innocent look remarkable, because, reader probably suspected, really concerned Mr. Mole's recent adventure. In short, Jack Alme, Harry Hannifar, domestic scene described, Turkish dress ladies' custom keeping veiled, immensely assisting imposture. "Whatever matter here?" asked Jack. "As coming along, heard dreadful row outside, saw large body troops bolting deuce hurry." "Oh, sons," replied pasha, tone paternal pathos, "sore hath wretchedness distress afflicted parent. I wish here, could happened. I will tell it." Jack Harry Girdwood sufficient self-command listen unmoved countenances Mr. Mole's account adventure, even express great surprise alarm harrowing details. "Shall I write home Mrs. Mole you, sir?" said Jack. "For Lord's sake, no," cried Mole, dismay. Then tried best frighten old tutor, suggesting various deadly schemes vengeance, possible ladies his late highness's seraglio might form Moley Pasha. "You must never go without strong body guard," said Jack, "for time may seized borne harem." "And you will take care even home," added Harry, "especially regard food eat, Turkey, owe grudge think nothing paying poison." "Gracious Heaven! do not talk way," cried Mole. "you quite make blood run cold. I think--I hope--I trust guards new attendants." "I hope too," replied Jack, shaking his head grave doubt. "But must always bear mind treachery one commonest vices East; cannot careful." "Oh, Allah, Allah!" exclaimed Mr. Mole, slipped naturally habit using Turkish interjections; "what life pasha. I used think glory happiness, I find, grief, that--if sort thing goes on, I shall bolt." It far advanced evening, pasha, wearied cares excitements day, retired rest Turkish fashion, half-dressed, upon kind sofa. His cork legs, course, carefully taken first. In Jack Harry assisted him. Moley Pasha went sleep dream bowstrings, scimitars, various painful forms execution. The next morning, however, he arose hopeful, fully resolved show vigorous successful ruler. In his sumptuous seat divan, hall audience, Mole began feel like monarch his throne, signed his decrees triumphant flourish Napoleon. It height power glory arose sudden consternation court. Murmurs arose, shouts, mingled tramp many steeds, heard outside. "What is matter?" asked pasha. "Who dares make disturbance disturb pasha? Officer, command silence." A deadly stillness fell upon assembly. For moments one might heard pin drop. But distant shouts streets, tramp horses recommenced. The interpreter Harry Jack, stood side pasha, exchanged meaning glances, partook much alarm. Consternation could perceived every face court. It evident something serious occur. "Whatever meaning this?" cried pasha, seemed feel suspicion alarm. "Abdullah, go see means." The old interpreter hurried door. Jack Harry, impelled resistless curiosity, followed him. Karam, chief guard, same, many court followed excited expectant group. At moment, shouts outside grew louder fiercer. An angry consultation, half dozen least engaged, talking once, could heard, Karam, chief guard, came rushing back face full dismay. "Your highness----" he gasped. "Well, Karam, what is matter?" asked Mole. "A grand officer, calls Moley Pasha, name excellency, outside body troops, insists upon admission." Mole started his seat, almost immediately sank exhausted fright horror. He saw peril he stood, devoutly wished he safe home, arms Mrs. Mole. "A--pasha--calling Moley!" he exclaimed. "What he want?" "He declares he appointed government firman his imperial majesty sultan, you--you--pardon, highness--are impostor." Mole knew worst. It him. But desperation inspired artificial courage; he resolved die game, keep last. "Tell so-called Moley Pasha," he exclaimed, "that he impostor. Here, guards, stand round me, defend rightful governor." The soldiers wavered. They began fear quite right. Karam, captain, also hesitated enforcing commands Mole. At moment scale turned Abdullah, interpreter, rushing hall, thundering forth, utter amazement consternation Mole-- "Down impostor, friends. We deceived usurper, forged sacred signature mighty sultan." Shouts "Down impostor!" resounded sides, rush made drag Mole his seat. Poor Mole, he entirely defenceless. Jack Harry return; probably secured enemy. Mole gave lost. He surrounded infuriated crowd, still shouting "Down impostor! Death infidel dares wear colours blessed Prophet!" It seems, indeed, luckless Mole would fallen sacrifice Lynch law, moment real Moley Pasha, his troops, entered hall, commanded infuriated crowd stop, relinquish victim. "Now," said real Moley Pasha, "bring stranger audaciously assumed title dignity." Poor Mole, trembling "prisoner bar," brought, bound guarded soldiers, magnate late he defied. "Prisoner," said pasha, sternly, "what dare say defence crime committed?" Mr. Mole, deepest fright humility, made shift stammer Turkish-- "I do not defend all; I--I egged young Jack Harkaway." "What is Harkaway?" inquired pasha. "The youth came me, passed son, Yakoob, his friend Harry Girdwood, Haroun Pasha." "Ah! two impostors; bring forward," said pasha. Search made Jack Harry, nowhere found. In confusion contrived make good escape. "Well, must make example chief offender," said pasha. "Prisoner, I find difficulty expressing language, alone stamped impostor. I suppose speak French?" he added, continuing his interrogation language. "I command instantly point accomplices villainous fraud." "The interpreter, Abdullah, highness," said Mole, glad avenged upon worthy. Here Abdullah came forward, making gesture disgust, turning his eyes pious horror. "Inshallah! lies dogs speak!" he exclaimed. "I swear highness, prophet, I knew not, suspected not, till moment he he seemed." "You rascally old villain! deserve bowstringing this," cried Mole. "Peace!" sternly cried pasha. "Show forgery dare call firman his sublime majesty, sultan." Mole instantly produced unlucky document. The real Moley Pasha instantly compared his own. "An impudent forgery!" he exclaimed, turning cadi town, arrived, much amazed dismayed occurred. "Pardon me, I entreat, excellency," said old cadi. "I trust let accusation go further. In case, associates office quite much blame." "It Was Frankish magician befooled us his spells," said several town officials. And pointed Mole fierce vengeful gestures, made feel certain his life would sacrificed vengeance. "I doubt whether witchcraft mere folly," said pasha, much enlightened his audience. "It seems giaour probably dupe others. But, case, he must go unpunished. Prisoner, crime proved, I sentence to----" He paused. Mole fell his knees. "To week's imprisonment first place, allow time inquiries made, and, necessary, communicate receive sublime Master's commands matter. Till kept solitary confinement, bread water, closely guarded." "Mercy!" Mole found tongue exclaim. "I trust--I implore highness least spare wretched life, I declare----" "Away him," interrupted pasha. So unhappy Mole taken chains his dungeon, bread water, horrible anticipations his ultimate fate. CHAPTER LXXVII. MOLE IN "THE DEEPEST DUNGEON"--HOPES OF RESCUE. The unfortunate Isaac Mole reduced position unprecedented even his varied career. He placed "deepest dungeon" old castle, used town gaol, cold stone cell himself, couple fierce-looking bashi-bazouks watch him. Bread water--both stalest--constituted poor Mole's fare, his lodging literally "on cold, cold ground." The constant fear terrible doom haunted him. It third night his incarceration, middle night Mole kept awake his depressing thoughts, together gambols rats infested dungeon. Suddenly deadly stillness broken sound outside, much agitated him. "Ha, sound that?" cried Mole; "yes, oh, joy, sound flute." Could he mistake note? Who could make melancholy strains desolate orphan--the melodious Figgins? Had Figgins, forgetting past differences animosities, come soothe Mole's captivity, manner, or--horrible thought!--was strain malice revengeful triumph emanated long-suffering tortured instrument. But flute long continue playing, Mole conjectured signal he expected respond. He mode whatever so, excepting melancholy whistle, which, however, served purpose. Through bars prison, far high reach, small object suddenly came crashing, narrowly escape falling upon prisoner's nose. Reaching his hand dark, Mr. Mole picked up, found stone wrapped paper. He knew must written message his friends outside, he whistled signal he received it. A triumphant notes flute responded this, silent again. How impatient Mole daylight, he might read letter. But many hours yet, sleep he found impossible. At length, faint streak came bars gloomy dungeon. Mole, difficulty, dragged light, straightened paper, read thus-- "ISAAC MOLE, ESQUIRE,--You forgotten friends, much lament misfortune. We narrowly escaped caught served way. We have, Captain Deering, got hold British consul, represented affair practical joke, deserving severe punishment. So hope get fine, undertake pay, whatever may be. Therefore, keep pecker, old man, believe us "Yours, truly ever, "JACK AND FRIENDS." "Cool, way they have served me," tutor's mental comment upon message; "but question is, Can British consul, man, get clutches ferocious Turks?" The next night, Mole able sleep. But his sleep suddenly fearfully interrupted. An awful confused noise, shouting outside, flashing lights bars, clash arms hurried tramp men, indicated prison scene warlike commotion. Mole started state great alarm, struggled towards door his cell. "Oh, dear, oh, dear!" cried poor Mole, "this dreadful. Oh, I boy again. I would stick Old England, never leave it. There, again. Oh, dear, I leave Mrs. Mole?" The noise mutiny outbreak kind. Nearer nearer came sound footsteps, louder louder sounded clashing arms, clanking chains. A shout triumph sounded outside his cell door, amidst volley interjections Turkish Arabic, he fancied he could hear English shouts of-- "Hurrah! boys, shall it. Open every one doors, set free." Two heavy bolts shot back outside, heavy key turned lock, Mole's cell door opened, burst torch-light entered groups armed Bedouin Arabs. Mole shrank back corner. These ferocious Moslems doubtless come murder hot blood. In reality object quite different. The event happened outbreak within walls garrison, inbreak whose purpose rescue captives. Jack Harry day put encampment friendly Arabs, became friendly still found guests liberal respect coinage. One Arabs brother prison awaiting pasha's orders punishment, anxious help Jack release Arab chief. Jack Harry, informed this, thought would excellent opportunity escape Mole, incarcerated gaol. The party set middle night. They soon reached prison. Darkness befriended them. The first step gain admission outer yard enclosure. This suddenly setting upon two warders outside, and, could give alarm, binding, gagging, disarming them. Then, mounting one sentry-boxes, Jack Harry, lightest agile members party, contrived thus get gate, drop inside. Here, great labour, forced back ponderous bolts, Arabs poured building. The alarm taken, old castle Alla-hissar, called, uproar. Gaolers soldiers, utterly taken aback sudden onslaught, made ineffectual resistance. Ere could grasp weapons put order defence, Bedouins them, striking down, forcing away keys, ill-treating proportion resistance attack made. "Tell me, slave," thundered Arab chief, one gaolers, "in cell brother Hadj Maimoun confined?" "In--in No. 6," answered man, trembling his life. "Art thou sure? Deceive me, dog, thou diest," continued chief, threateningly placing muzzle his pistol man's forehead. "I swear, holy tomb Mecca." "Enough; key?" "It numbered, great lord: see here, No. 6." "And cell lieth----" "To right yonder. I lead highness thither." "Do so, attempt deceive us, fiend save revenge. Come on, friends; Hadj Maimoun shall free." A wild shout triumph rose Arabs. In moments reached cell indicated, young Arab, heavy chains, looked entrance. The chief recognised his brother. "Strike chains, villain!" Arab commanded gaoler. The chains dropped young Arab, whereat his friends raised another triumphant shout-- "Allah, Allah, Allah! Glory Prophet. Hadj Maimoun free." By time prison fairly hands victorious invaders. One man, however, managed slip out, made best his way town rouse pasha officials. CHAPTER LXXVIII. THE RESCUE OF MOLE. Mr. Mole's place incarceration would difficult find large rambling old building, Jack, similar threats Arab chief, forced one gaolers tell number cell. Armed information bunch keys, Jack made his way deepest dungeon, followed rest. Mole's cell remote, therefore last came to. "Mercy, mercy! do not kill unfortunate prisoner, got three wives somewhere world, lot little black white children look after!" cried Mr. Mole, still confused tumult around him, ferocious aspect new-comers. "Kill you, Mr. Mole; why, we have come let out," said foremost group, he flung back cowl his Moorish cloak, thereby revealing Mole startling fact, instead murderous Arab, young Jack Harkaway. Harry close him. A words revealed Mole actual state affairs. "Oh, boys, boys," he exclaimed, "what I suffered you. But still, Jack, boy, I afraid them. No, boy, I intended fought last, I doubt I killed dozen two  them." "No doubt, sir; let us get this," said Jack. "Come on." "But hands fastened heavy chains," said Mole. "Bring hammer chisel, fellows," called Jack, "and we will  them time." The ex-pasha therefore operated upon, minutes chains off, Mole nearly free man--not quite free, however, time whole neighbourhood arms; pasha roused hurry, mustering his troops, hurried gaol. "We shall fight it, lads," cried Jack, drawing his Arab sabre; "we must cut way them, we are lost certainty." The Bedouins prepared follow leader death. The chief Zenaib, his brother, Hadj Maimoun, led desperate enterprise, numbers followers increased escaped prisoners. As came rushing out, opposed twice number well-armed troops, cut best could. It desperate conflict. Hand-to-hand, cut-and-thrust, bullets discharged pistols muskets, fierce charges bayonets, continued half hour. The confusion dreadful, noise deafening, numbers men killed wounded sides making result far tragic hero his companion ever anticipated desired. The prisoners fought secure liberty, Arabs hatred Turks, Jack Harry, particular animosity either party, fought desperately self-defence. They received several severe cuts, short time got entirely separated friend Mole. He, meantime, half propped wall, valorously holding his former gaoler, trying recapture him. At length, Arabs, finding impossible break way large body disciplined troops, fell back, destruction would inevitable. But, moment, one half-escaped prisoners called he discovered back entrance, side building, might make exit. The Arab chief accordingly ordered immediate retreat. The Turkish soldiers, seeing manoeuvre, gave chase them, whilst others ordered round intercept flight back. Jack Harry returned Mole, took them; one holding arm, got along swiftly cork legs feet _ci-devant_ pasha would allow. But ill-luck would it, emerging one alleys, met detachment Turkish soldiers, rushed upon them. The whole three gave lost. Mole length stumbled, fell heavily ground. "Save once," he groaned. "Do not mind me; I am done for, I cannot get step further. Oh, dear, head's bleeding sword cut. Run! Make haste, dear boy; wretches firing us!" Reluctantly two youths obeyed instinct self-preservation, letting go hands old tutor, turning round, immediately dived one adjoining alleys. It time, moment, two musket balls whizzed close difference mere inch would certain death. It narrow escape them; sight soldiers, finally reached place perfect safety, all, Harry remarked-- "A miss good mile." Meanwhile, Mole's catalogue misfortunes still added to. Picked up, bleeding exhausted, soldiers, he instantly taken officer commanding troops. Several Arabs, Turkish soldiers, two gaolers killed, many wounded men required attending to. The commander enough restoring matters order, therefore he left punishment Mole his lieutenant. "Remove prisoners, present, guardroom," said lieutenant. "When I open council noon divan bring me." "Your excellency's word law," answered head gaoler, bowing. The lieutenant turned his horse, and, followed his bodyguard, rode home ill temper. An hour two's rest, however, soothing effects pipe coffee, somewhat restored his equanimity time he re-entered divan. Punctually noon, prisoners brought head gaoler. "Let see," said lieutenant, referring document, checking captives identified; "horse-stealing, highway robbery, drunkenness, assault--yes, I resolved do. As offences seem comparatively light, prison present inefficient, I shall order men punished bastinado." "There one more," said lieutenant. "This, I find, wretched Frank dared personate great pasha." "Nothing escapes honour's penetration," answered vizier. "Such crime deserves heavier punishment. However, his turn comes, give twenty-five blows." "It shall done, illustrious governor," response. And forthwith summoned two burly officials whose unpopular duty administer castigation. One bore stout rattan, several pieces strong rope. The frame lashed brought room, lieutenant's intention punishment administered his presence. The first prisoner seized, his slippers--stockings worn majority Turks--taken off. He bound hand foot, securely tied frame. The two executioners took turns administer ten heavy blows upon bare soles criminal. At first blow, patient set howl, seemed increase vigour energy operator. It indeed terrible sight person sensitiveness see human being--though deserving--suffer manner. Mole, however, did not feel anxiety score, he made his mind brave noble Englishman, he knew might hammer away his cork soles ever, without hurting much. What troubled probability would take his stockings off, discovering insensate nature his "understandings," order deadly punishment. So, infliction seeing several men suffer, various degrees bravery cowardice, variety groans contortions, Mole heard called similar castigation. He had, meantime, thought _ruse_. Then, marching boldly lieutenant, he addressed him-- "I know I fully deserve dreadful sentence quietly I submit torture; but, I entreat you, compel remove stockings, which, among countrymen, considered deepest degradation never inflicted, save upon criminals sentenced death." "H'm!" said lieutenant, somewhat moved. "For part, I would soon suffer infliction bare feet thin layer stocking." "But feelings Englishman," pleaded Mole. "Well, wish. Take shoes only; but, Hamed, remember give little harder, make stockings." "Great lieutenant, I obey. The force blows shall doubled." At moment, Mole saw eyes Tinker fixed upon him, he knew he yet get help. Mole submitted resignedly hands torturers. Binding like others, hand foot, tied frame, chief castigator, rolling his sleeves, proceeded belabour Mole's soles terrific energy. The blows sounded fearfully loud sharp, given vigour even framework creaked it. But victim showed pain terror. He cry out, flinch least, strive mitigate pain twisting about. Thus ten heavy blows given, inflictor paused. A murmur astonishment ran round assembly. "Truly Frank hath wondrous strength courage," exclaimed lieutenant. "Englishman generally brave," said old Turk; "but I never knew one would silently undergo pain this." "Make next ten blows harder." The second man, therefore, his turn, rained upon inanimate soles ex-pasha, fearful blows resounded place, made many spectators shudder. But still victim neither flinched cried out. "_Bismallah!_ truly wonderful, giaour old, grey, apparently feeble, thus bear terrible punishment. Harder, Selim. Now feel it, prisoner?" "Of course I feel it, great pasha; even tickles beard," replied Mole; "but heaven hath given power withstand terrible torture, high spirit Englishman forbids cry out." "I could scarcely believed it, I behold eyes," said puzzled lieutenant. "Selim, little harder." "Your eminence, tale blows fully counted," said man, laying aside his cane. "Five-and-twenty already? I interested prisoner's fortitude, I did not count them. He suffered enough yet; give five blows more." "I ready," said Mole, stroking his false beard. "Remember, Englishman fears pain. Strike away." And he stretched his cork legs full extent. Five blows given, effect previous ones. "By holy kaaba! amounts miracle," exclaimed lieutenant. "I shall begin respect infidel his heroism. Hamed, give ten blows; no, make twenty, you, Selim, assist. That fifty; double amount sentence. If he flinches time, he deserve let altogether." And truth, would, ordinary circumstances, wanted well-nigh strength Samson Hercules endure torture came upon schoolmaster. Hamed Selim, armed heavy rattan, rained alternately thick fast, shower blows upon Mole's wonderful feet, even shook room, still could not shake Mole's resolution. He writhed not, uttered cry, showed faintest sign giving way. On contrary, he jeered men. "Bah! see Englishman bear pain," exclaimed Mole. And intense astonishment Turks, he plucked good-sized handful hair his beard threw officer. "Allah is--ah!" And Turk stopped midst his speech spit second handful Mole, good aim, thrown his mouth. "Wonderful!" exclaimed bystanders, Mole tore away his false beard till he nearly stripped framework, tormentors worked away his feet redoubled energy. "Stop, stop," cried pasha, men energy exceeded even fifty blows without knowing it, seemed going _ad libitum_, "stop; unbind release prisoner." The two men, bathed perspiration exertions, accordingly removed Mole's bonds, assisted his feet, helped put his shoes. "Prisoner," said lieutenant, "your heroic conduct day deepest admiration. Be seated, rest poor feet, tell something history." "My poor feet still support me, therefore I seated, standing thus," said Mole, stamping his cork feet ground, "will show something wonderful." CHAPTER LXXIX. MOLE PASHA ASTONISHES THE NATIVES STILL MORE--THE ORDER OF THE GLASS BUTTON. "I attention," replied lieutenant. "I came land," said Mr. Mole, grandiloquent flourish, "where despise physical suffering." The august Turks around filled wonder admiration speaker. After witnessed, prepared credit Mr. Mole's extravagant assertions. "Would proof great courage?" demanded Mr. Mole, folding his arms striking defiant attitude. "Brave man, show us courage?" reply. "Behold!" cried Mole. The whole assembly eyed Mr. Mole's movements greatest curiosity now. "Bring dozen sharp implements, swords, knives, daggers, etc, etc." They brought him, he laid row upon carpet. The first needle dimensions ordinary bodkin. Next this, small iron skewer. After came long-bladed dagger knife. And finally, cut-and-thrust sword alarming dimensions. "You shall see now," said Mole, sternly, "how I despise trivialities bastinado." What he now? In solemn silence, Mr. Mole bared his right calf, requested company his black servant Tinker, still hall. The request granted. "Tinker." "Yes, Massa Mole." "Go fetch me----" Here he sank his voice whisper, rest his instructions heard one save darkey, intended. In course moments, Tinker returned passed something slyly Mr. Mole's hand. It small sponge oil-skin bag. Yet appeared saturated something, judge way handled, Mr. Mole slyly put his pocket. Mr. Mole took smallest row implements described. "Behold Englishman do!" And amazement spectators, he thrust needle thick part his calf. A quiet smile played corners his mouth. But sign slightest suffering. "Judge much bastinado affect me," he said, superb disdain. "Allah praised!" ejaculated Turk; "wondrous man." "Behold," pursued Mole, picking skewer. He passed fairly his calf, stood his foot firmly planted ground, gazing like another "monarch he surveyed." "Look again." And Mole took large nail, hammered his foot, he pinned floor. "Allah praised!" shouted Turks. "One proof," he said, disdainfully. He picked another dagger, pushed resolutely ill-used leg. At time he held calf his left hand, he concealed, considerable dexterity, sponge Tinker brought him. Blood trickled slowly Mr. Mole's fingers, ran his legs feet. A thrill terror passed assemblage. "Yet another proof," exclaimed Mole, grandly. "No more, more," exclaimed Turk. Mole withdrew nail his foot, dagger his leg, seizing sword, he thrust ferocious energy mutilated leg. He pressed his hand wound, blood flowed small torrent, spectators groaned. Mole looked round proudly--defiantly. Had he conquered field Waterloo, he could shown greater apparent belief himself. He smiled sardonically he bound wounded legs his scarf. Mr. Mole nearly spoilt his exhibition his marvellous power endurance, pricking his finger accidentally pin, he sang lustily, much astonishment Turks. But he lucky recover time Turks could divine occurred. "You must invent something violent punishment I yet seen here, would subdue soul Isaac Mole." And he strode along air heavy man transpontine melodrama. The marvellous exhibition endurance aroused phlegmatic Turk real enthusiasm. "Mole Pasha," he exclaimed, "you great hero. I shall seek audience his highness Sultan, beg mark distinction, perhaps even confer upon distinguished order glass button." "The glass bottle would excellency's way, Mole Pasha," suggested Tinker. And henceforth Mole walked abroad, population aroused. "Behold bravest Frank ever lived," said. "He great hero." CHAPTER LXXX. THE SNAKE IN THE GRASS--THE POISONED DAGGER. As young Jack sauntering streets town one day, he fancied he followed man dressed semi-Oriental garb, whose head shaded broad-brimmed hat. Jack given fear without because, yet he certainly feel uncomfortable now. At first he thought turning round facing man sharply. But this, he reflected, might lead rupture. A rupture carefully avoided. He determined, however, assure he followed. With view, he made circuitous tour city. Still man like his shadow. "This unendurable," muttered Jack. So he drew short. Grasping pistol, he carried his pocket, nervous grip, he waited man come up. But man come up. He disappeared suddenly, moment Jack expecting come collision him. How strange! Jack conscious enemy--at least one part world. "Very strange," he muttered; "very strange!" And brooding episode, Jack wended his way thoughtfully homewards. * * * * "Hah!" Crossing threshold his residence, Jack suddenly swiftly assaulted. The semi-Oriental figure stolen stealthily behind him, murderous-looking knife dealt sharp, swift blow. Jack bounded forward, turned round pistol hand, nearly fatal blow Jack's coat ripped back. "Hah!" The assassin marvellously nimble; although Jack made dart pistol hand, meaning wreak summary vengeance upon him, ruffian contrived vanish again--mysteriously. Strangely disturbed this, Jack went home related his friends taken place. "This rum go," said Mr. Mole; "you mistaken somebody else." "So I suppose," returned Jack. "What is done?" said Harry Girdwood. "Lodge information police once, I say," suggested Mole. "By means." "What he like?" "I could scarcely see," Jack's reply, "for he gone like phantom." "Perhaps phantom," suggested Harry slily. "I half inclined think so," said Jack, "if I had not received solid proof he flesh blood." Saying which, he turned round displayed back his coat, ripped open assassin's dagger. "Well," exclaimed Mole aghast, "that cool." "I am glad think so," returned Jack, "for I tell much warm me." "Well, shall soon leave wretched place, I hope," said Mole, "for I do not feel safe life. I expecting every day pasha." "We must always watch now," said Harry Girdwood; "constant vigilance he necessary avert danger." * * * * Let us follow movements would-be assassin. The secret his sudden disappearance really great mystery all. Darting round first corner put house Jack's pistol, he found suddenly seized vigorous hand, dragged open doorway. "Let go," hissed assassin, fiercely, "or----" He raised his long-bladed knife strike, he could bring his arm down, dagger beaten his grasp. "Now," said stranger planting his foot firmly upon knife, "listen me." "You speak English," said assassin, surprise. "Because spoke English me," reply; "until then, I took one us." "What want me?" demanded Englishman, doggedly. "Not much," returned other, speaking great fluency, although his foreign accent strongly marked. "I saved consequences failure. Had friendly hand drag sight, young countryman would shot you." "Well," returned assassin, surlily, "I owe thanks, and----" "Stop--tell would like succeed spite late failure?" "Yes." "Then I give safe sure method." "My eternal thanks," began foiled ruffian. The stranger interrupted him. "Reserve thanks. Tell offer I help you." "Money!" "How much give see enemy removed path?" "I give good round sum," returned Englishman, eagerly. "Name sum." He did. A good round sum too. "Now, then," said Turk, producing small phial containing pale greenish fluid. "Observe this." "Well?" "Anoint dagger this. Scratch it; let scratch prick pin, he beyond aid mortal man." "Is sure?" "Beyond doubt. Would proof?" "Yes." "Wait moment." The Turk left room, presently he appeared carrying small iron cage. "Look." He held cage, showed contained two large rats. "Now," said he, "remove stopper dip dagger's point in." The Englishman obeyed. "Now, prick either rats ever slightly." The Englishman pushed point dagger bars cage, one rats came sniff it--probably anticipating savoury tit-bit eat. Moving dagger slightly, barely grazed rat's nose. But sufficed. The poor beast shivered once, sank dead. "What say now?" demanded Turk. "I satisfied," replied Englishman. "Now, go," said Turk, "I give hint. The slightest scratch suffice, see." "Yes." "Dip two ordinary pins poison, send letter enemy. Place opening envelope, he probably scratch his finger." The Englishman's eyes sparkled viciously. "I will, I will." "Let know result, want aid, note well house leaving know return." "Yes. What name?" demanded Englishman. "Hadji Nasir Ali," reply; "and yours?" The hesitated. "Do not give unless feel safe," said Turk. "There is harm knowing it," returned Englishman. "My name Harkaway." "Hark-a-way?" "In one word." "I see. Farewell, then." "Farewell." And interview concluded. * * * * "That letter splendid dodge. Look out, Master Jack Harkaway, look out, I mean cry quits now, name Herbert Murray," muttered Englishman, he walked away. But Herbert Murray got Turkey requires explanation. It within readers' recollection his unsuccessful attempt Chivey's life, adventure groom old Spaniard, Murray found board ship his groom. He resolved make best circumstance, could altered. A days leaving Spanish coast put one Mediterranean ports, heard young Jack his friends gone Turkey. "I will follow them!" exclaimed Murray. "I I like governor's gone I have plenty tin, look yourself, Jack Harkaway." Murray's ship delayed adverse weather, length reached port, Herbert scarcely put foot shore, he beheld young Jack, object his deadly hate, walking coolly street smoking cigar. This enraged Murray he hastened disguise Oriental attire, made attempt Jack's life related. * * * * That night man found dead threshold house Jack Harkaway his friends resided. How he died one could imagine, he scratch his body. Yet, stay. There scratch. Just more. In his fast-clenched hand found envelope addressed Mr. John Harkaway, closer examination pin's point seen sticking paper. This pricked messenger's hand. So slightly that, tiny wound turned slightly blue, would entirely escaped notice. * * * * Jack aware he Turkey deadly enemy, he he could yet tell. When men skill assembled around body, puzzled assign death one suggested apoplexy. So apoplexy unanimously set for. There fuss made. The man poor devil Circassian, got precarious livelihood public messenger. So "Rattled his bones Over stones, Like pauper nobody owns." And meanwhile, his murderer went his way. "Fortunate I gave name Harkaway old professional poisoner, never trace job me." There was, however, one result using Jack Harkaway's name Herbert Murray certainly never contemplated. But must speak hereafter. * * * * In spite his knowledge fact he enemies following his footsteps, hero would remain house. "I quite safe street here," said he, reply Harry Girdwood's representations danger he ran, "and I sure, old boy, would show white feather." "You never that, never will; need run unnecessary danger." "'Thrice he armed his quarrel just,' his revolver well loaded. Ta-ta! I going stroll Turkish substitute postoffice, see last night's steamer brought letters." So Jack strolled accordingly, found letter him. His heart beat joy he recognised handwriting, he hurried home read it. On breaking open envelope, tumbled beautiful carte de visite portrait, copy able give, still thoroughly retain young Jack's friendship confidence. He kissed till he began fear he might spoil likeness, placing table him, began read. And letter-- "DEAR JACK,--_You naughty boy. Where been, written? I great mind scold you, sir; second thoughts, I think I better leave task correcting parents, who, perhaps, influence I have. You do not know, dear, anxious you. Poor Mr. Mole started search you. Have seen yet?--and do not write soon, I shall feel obliged try find become you, I almost begin fear fair Turkish Circassian girl_----" "The deuce!" Jack thought; "she cannot heard thing affair yet. If Mole written, letter could reached England 20th last month." Then he continued-- "----_has stolen heart, Harry Girdwood's too. Why, poor Paquita always red eyes she gets up. So, darling Jack, write once, cheer hearts. I cannot help writing like this, I feel fearful something happened you. So dear, good boy, send full account doings father, lines "Your ever faithful affectionate._ "EMILY. "_P.S.--I reading see I cross, father came photographer, took portrait without knowing anything it. Do think like me, sir?_" Then followed three four blots ladies call "kisses." CHAPTER LXXXI. MR. MOLE AGAIN OUT OF LUCK. Herbert Murray, attended Chivey, strolling principal street town, smoking his cigar, thinking he could yet serve young Jack, he suddenly saw, front, figure elderly man, appeared walk difficulty. He made uncertain steps singular movements, he hobbled along aid stick, effect, however painful him, ludicrous onlookers. "Why, blest are not old Mole, man came bid young Harkaway his friends good-bye sailed," cried Chivey. "Or his ghost," said Murray. "I will lark him, sir," said tiger, laying his finger aside his nose, winking knowingly. "You see!" And walking nimbly tiptoe behind old man, he soon caught without his knowing it. Murray halted little distance, ready behold enjoy discomfiture Mole. The reader must informed venerable Isaac experimenting upon new substitute unfortunate much damaged members, his cork legs. An American genius, he recently made acquaintance town, induced Mole try pair his "new patent-elastic-spring- non-fatiguing-self-regulating-undistinguishable-everlasting cork legs." The inventor helped Mr. Mole put formidable "understandings," given every instruction regard management. "They will little creaky first," said American; "nothing nature works slick it is quite new, get  them well wear, they will go along like greased lightning; try them, old hoss." Creaky indeed were, made noise almost loud railway break; even worse Yankee failed inform Mole fact "new patent" etc., fitted act perfectly smooth surface. Now roadway, footway--for old Turkish towns--are reverse smooth, principally composed round nubbly stones. Consequently Mole's locomotion reverse pleasant. Chivey crept behind old schoolmaster, seizing opportunity one his legs, gave pull, caused Mole roar fright. Down, course, came Mole nubbly pavement, Chivey did not exactly fun he expected, instead his getting safely away, Mole fell him. "Oh, it is you, it? You, bad servant bad man's wicked son," exclaimed angered tutor; "it is dare set upon defenceless age innocence, new cork legs on? Very good. Then take that, I hope will not like it." Whereat he began pommelling away Chivey. Chivey roared his might, till small crowd wondering onlookers began collect. "What mean daring assault servant manner?" asked Murray sternly, he came up. "He attacked first," protested Mole; "and it is belief set it." "How dare insinuate----" began Murray, he violently shook old man collar. But spirit Mole Herbert prepared for. By aid post, old man managed struggle his feet, leaning this, he felt he could defy enemy. "My lad," he said, "it is evident did not get enough flogging school, you would know better manners; I must take hand bit now, sir, there!" With his stick he gave cut palm Murray's hand, he will not refractory pupils old days. Murray livid rage. Chivey, rather afraid Mole, did not interfere. "Come on, like, more," said Mole, shaking his stick them, he urged his wild career. Very wild indeed was, too. Mole's patent legs, outwardly looked natural ones, indeed self-regulating, soon utterly beyond control wearer; seemed possessed wills own; one wished go right, left. Sometimes would carry along double quick march time, anon halt, beyond his power budging. Of course boys town attracted stranger's singular movements, began hoot jeer. The merchants interrupted calculations, bazaar keepers came doors, long pipe mouth, see "son Sheitan" about. Mole red face hard work. "Confound Turks," he cried; "why do not make roads smoother? Oh, dear, I wish I could manage unhappy legs; go." By time crowd become unpleasantly dense around him. "Out way, un-Christian dogs," cried Mole, flourishing his stick round his head; "I am Englishman, I have right to--hallo! goes again." [Illustration: "'OUT OF THE WAY, UNCHRISTIAN DOGS,' CRIED MOLE."--TINKER, VOL. II.] For his left leg took two steps right, he came his weight upon toe white-bearded Alla-hissite. "Son dog," growled old Turk, he rubbed his pet corn agony; "may mother's grave defiled, jackass bray father's bones." "I really beg pardon," began Mole, moment his right leg taken spasmodic action, began stride along furious rate, creaking like mad. Mole lost control (if he ever any) his movements, carried forward again, till he came Herbert Murray Chivey, made _detour_, happened turning corner street. "Stop me," yelled Mole, he flourished his stick his head; "my spring legs like me. I control them. Oh, dear, again." Chivey, undeterred his recent castigation, thought he would repeat trick, so, Mole came up, he, dexterous jerk, turned round pivot. He thus stopped his forward course, did not check action his clockwork legs, scudded along swiftly before, heart yelling crowd. The result rather bad Turks; went like lot ninepins Mole's railway-like progression. "A mad Christian," cried; "he possessed devil; him." The perspiration streamed Mole's face; he felt spring-work his new cork legs stop, he die. At moment body women approached, closely veiled. Their _yashmaks_ obscured eyes, could seen open wide wonder extraordinary behaviour red-faced giaour. Two younger slender ones fell piercing screams Mole's impetuous charge. A third, stout woman middle age, stood her ground, Mole, he could stop himself, rushed her arms, floored her. The scream she gave surpassed loudness others put together; brought several ferocious-looking Turks, bent condignly punishing outrageous conduct mad Englishman. "Death giaour; him!" roared excited crowd. What fate he would suffered dread think, he found unexpected deliverer person old white-bearded Turk, whose corns he trodden on. "Defile hands blood unbeliever," he said; "but take cadi answer his conduct." "To cadi, cadi!" cry. "Hear me," said Mole, astonishing his proficiency Turkish; "I blame, events, take two Englishmen assaulted me." He pointed Murray Chivey, time got dense crowd Turks, elbowing angry manner. "Take infidels cadi," cried Turks. Herbert Murray Chivey accordingly seized, whole three borne one doom. The cadi seated his divan, administering justice, his custom, open air. His style summary, vigorous. "Let giaour, unwarrantably assaulted true believers, receive one hundred lashes," he said; "or pay fifty pieces silver treasury." "I have not got money," said Mole. "Then receive punishment," said cadi. This time ceremony used; two negroes bound Mole, pulled his shoes stockings, exposed view new patent steel clock-work legs. "Allah, here?" cried cadi. "Is Christian enchanted, half man, half machinery?" "My lord," said Mole, "if you will permit speak, I will explain all. "Having lost legs wars, helping Turks beat foes, I induced try substitute new invention, behold, legs enchanted, I control them." "Allah kerim! Can be?" exclaimed cadi. "That whole reason conduct, excellency," pursued Mole; "otherwise, I would perish sooner attacked true believers. But infidels," he added, pointing Murray Chivey, "first attacked me, many may bear witness." "If so," said magistrate, "we remit sentence payment fifty sequins." "Gladly would I pay sum I it," said Mole; "but I have not." "Search him," cried cadi. Mole searched, investigations officer could bring light greater sum his pockets bad sixpence battered fourpenny-piece. "Little enough," grumbled cadi, pocketing amount; "but have, I consent take it. We must infidels; English, look rich. Bring me." Herbert Murray Chivey accordingly examined. Mole gave evidence assaulting him, though utterly denied so, Mole's statement backed several believers witnessed it, judge declared guilty, sentenced bastinado. "Me bastinadoed!" exclaimed indignant Murray,. "I would know, sir, I am Englishman rank, influence, property, and----" "Of influence, eh? Very good; you will pay fine five hundred sequins," cried cadi, exultantly. "I swear I have not----" "Search infidels," cried cadi. The officers so, altogether twenty-five pounds, gold, notes silver, found upon Murray Chivey. With audible chuckle, cadi took possession all. "There," he said; "so go peace, you; I find making another disturbance town, bastinado gaol, well fine. Go, infidels, remember grand Turk." CHAPTER LXXXII. THE CONSPIRATORS--THE DEED--THE FALSE INFORMERS. The walls Alla-hissar gleamed noontide heat. The air heavy sleep, weighed upon living things, made seek shelter burning sun. All still city. It seemed spirit death brooded habitations. Yet awake dreary hour. Gathered together one principal houses secret conclave chief Turks province. In spite heat, heavy curtains covered doorways. The door shaded, assembly spoke subdued tones. At length Ibrahim Bey, grave old Turk, subtle resolute, arose. "It sacred then, friends," he said, looking round assembly; "the deed must done, hour hand." "Such Allah," reply conspirators. "It Is decided then, Moley Pasha, new governor, has, since he assumed power, done he could destroy old customs, introduce manners infidel Franks, therefore he must die." "He must die," murmured assembly. "Allah's done," said old Ibrahim, turning his eyes piously; "but whose hand shall blow struck? Who take upon dangerous deed?" Up rose Abdullah, interpreter, formerly Mr. Mole's party. "I it," he said, firm voice; "he dies ere another hour sped. I risk deadly danger, guarantee, I succeed, I shall rewarded." "That just," said Ibrahim Bey. "Should his sacred majesty's pleasure I succeed Moley, post honour shall guerdon bravery." "I accept terms," said Abdullah; "I know secret way palace, I disguise dagger; doubt courage rest. Wait here, friends, ere another hour strikes, I shall return say deed done." He glided room, leaving others wondering cool audacity he undertook desperate criminal deed. The angel sleep spread her wings seraglio Moley Pasha. The veiled beauties harem retired luxurious rooms. The pasha slept soundly peacefully. Well his dreams warned peril hovered like black shadow. For form woman, tall, thin, closely-veiled, glided along passages harem. Her steps gave forth sound, she disturbed sleeping servants. She glided like smooth serpent, invisible spirit; her presence unseen, unfelt, unsuspected. She enters inner chamber lies unconscious pasha. She bends him, she draws forth knife, slender, tapering point almost like needle. The pasha still slept on, fountain outside made sweet music, heard curtains windows. A smile played upon pasha's lips. He dreaming, perchance, rosy bowers dark-eyed _houris_ Paradise. Suddenly knife descended, flash moment, hovered like hawk quarry, next instant buried pasha's heart. A deep groan effort expiring nature. The fiercely flashing eyes, part face murderer exposed; dress woman, form features Abdullah interpreter. For moment he stood gazing his deed, lifted tapestry concealed small door, disappeared. * * * * What cry startles seraglio siesta? What combined lamentation disturbs whole palace harrowing intensity? All inmates establishment rudely awakened slumbers. It pasha's favourite wife broken upon privacy her lord, she found dead. Dead, plainly assassin's dagger, assassin, none could even suspect. None could conjecture means stranger could obtained entrance exit. Then arose dreadful wail despair, beating breasts, tearing tresses. The news soon spread, whole town fever commotion. Who done deed? Who Moley Pasha's successor? The conspirators played parts well. Ibrahim Bey pretended terribly amazed shocked: he refused placed head affairs sultan's known, he offered rewards discovery assassin. A council, consisting Ibrahim others, established temporarily rule town. A grand funeral, dignitaries place attended, given unfortunate pasha, evening his assassination. The night arrived firman sultan, proclaiming Ibrahim Pasha Allahissar. Such perilous nature power dignity Eastern lands. Ibrahim appointed Abdullah his vizier, gave conspirators important posts. Several perfectly innocent men arrested hanged pretended suspicion caused late pasha's death. At first divan held new pasha, two Englishmen announced, said bearers important evidence murder. They admitted accordingly, proved others Murray Chivey. "Christians, welcome," said Ibrahim, his new vizier. "Allah his wisdom hath sent hither, wherefore discover knowledge." Murray bowed, seated upon chair pointed pasha. Chivey, servant, was not honoured seat, whereat he murmured, half himself-- "Well, might let cove sit down, offered us drop something cool hot weather, would not come unwelcome." Reclining his divan old Turkish style, smoking his _hookah_, Ibrahim listened Murray's communication. "It may already known excellency dominions young scapegrace Englishman, named Jack Harkaway. He surrounded many doers evil, worse even himself, amongst old scoundrel, formerly schoolmaster, who, though he lost his legs, still continues go about, get mischief." "The audacious giaour dared impersonate Moley Pasha?" asked Ibrahim. "The same," continued Murray. "Well, I received proofs Harkaway his friend murdered real Moley Pasha." "Shade Eblis!" exclaimed Ibrahim, pretending much shocked. "This must seen to; Christian, proceed." "Harkaway friend," continued Murray, "and quite speak him; love justice considerations." "Christian," said Ibrahim, "proceed." "In harem illustrious predecessor," said Murray, "there lately resided Greek girl, exquisite beauty, named Thyra, pearl delight, peri Paradise, she bewitched Harkaway, who, know not, penetrated within sacred precincts his highness's harem, stole her away." "Vengeance Allah! he deserves death!" exclaimed pasha, half rising, his eyes flashing anger. "But, eminence, make his crime complete, he committed another; he stabbed pasha heart." "By sword prophet, he dies!" exclaimed Ibrahim; "but proof hast thou this?" "I bring several witnesses truth I say," said Murray. "If proof wanting, Thyra, pearl beyond price, disappeared palace day, hour pasha's death, she residence Harkaway his friends." "Please, worship," broke Chivey, "if you will let talk, I will prove it, sure eggs eggs." "The giaour's servant entreats highness listen words truth," way astute Abdullah translated appeal. Chivey gave his evidence, story carefully concocted his master, added confirmation several natives town, men would swear black white, dollar two. Of course, old Mole represented Harkaway's chief adviser, his aider abettor late pasha's death. This story, course, really impose upon Ibrahim Pasha; he knew actual facts Murray could do, served his turn pretend believe it, he thanked Murray his information. Abdullah (the real assassin) profound dissembler, utterly devoid conscience, he put down, Murray's dictation, names innocent Harkaway his friends, remarking calmly-- "I think got hold right criminals last." "We send arrested once," said Ibrahim. "Vizier, let Christians rewarded information purse gold, despatch armed force lair English dogs, slain lamented predecessor. And, Vizier, do not forget, whatever do, bring beautiful Thyra me." "Pasha, hear obey," said Abdullah. "Ha, ha! I think we have done Harkaway party time," said Murray gleefully Chivey. "It capital dodge, I must say," answered Chivey, "although belief Ibrahim Passher old rascal, knows really last governor." "Keep suspicions yourself," said Murray. In short time captain pasha's guards, detachment troops, marched arrest hero his friends. The news spread like wildfire murderers late pasha length discovered. CHAPTER LXXXIII. JACK HAS TO STAND A SIEGE. And far Jack Harkaway his friends really guilty matter? It indeed true Thyra, beautiful Greek slave alluded to, fled harem late pasha. But nothing his assassination. No doubt Thyra cherished strong attachment young Jack, found refuge house. She could overcome it. "I throw upon protection," she said. "If I returned master's, fate would instant death, would preferable living without you, ever separated you." Jack much embarrassed. He told her, gently he could, her love hopeless. "Oh, say that," cried Thyra, bursting tears. "Do send away; I am ready slave, obey every word." Jack consulted his friends difficult delicate condition affairs, agreed Thyra must given pasha. An hour afterwards, report his murder made matters still serious. But he never dreamed suspicion actual crime would turned himself. It therefore agreed keep Thyra close concealment, opportunity offered get her back her friends. The house occupied Harkaway his friends was, like Oriental edifices, built endurance. The walls thick strong castle. The doorway narrow, led square courtyard garden, fountain centre. Into yard rooms opened. The windows facing street mere loopholes. The roof flat, evening formed favourite lounge, approached flight steps, one angle court. It necessary particular describing house, readers may fully understand follows. Jack Harkaway one morning courtyard, near centre, Harry Girdwood, looking heap curious weapons, purchased roaming bazaars. "Why, we have got quite armory here," said Harry Girdwood. "It is pity have not got fighting use them." "I mean make place kind fortress," said Jack. "Here, Bogey." "What after, Massa Jack?" asked nigger, appearing instantly. "Go take charge gate, do not let anyone pass without order." "Right are, massa; keep safe sentrybox," answered darkey. And he started take post assigned him. Jack next summoned Tinker. "Serve us dinner trees," said Jack; "and quick it, rascal, or----" "Understand puffeckly, massa," responded black. "To hear yer obey yer, dese Turkeys say. Yah, yah." It pleasant sit repast refreshing shade trees. Of course Mr. Mole orphan, well Thyra, waiter diver, summoned came juncture. The orphan Mole appeared arm-in-arm. Mr. Mole black bottle one hand tall glass other. He looked jolly, whilst orphan appeared rather melancholy, his flute got slightly cracked. "Have drop raise spirits," said schoolmaster, filling brimmer, fairly forcing his hand. The orphan could refuse pressing invitation. He drained glass, came upon top several more, effect upon inconsiderable. Intending walk straight table, he walked, instead, extremely "slantindicular," till lurching fountain he passed it, he stumbled ledge, fell splash middle basin. Mr. Mole, best intentions world, rushed his companion's rescue. Before Mole could reach orphan, his patent legs still uncontrollable, his head unsteady also, he fell backwards, smashing his wine bottle stones courtyard. The scene certainly ludicrous, elicited much laughter spectators. They, however, helped orphan his accidental unwelcome bath, which, though drenched him, also sobered him. Mole also assisted re-assume erect posture, short time, sufficiently recovered take places table. Mole Figgins seemed somewhat struck warlike appearance place. "What going cutlery?" inquired Mr. Mole. "Perhaps mean set scissors trade?" suggested orphan. "You will see by, old man," answered hero. "We shall find  them useful, perhaps sooner expect." "Oh, dear! I hope not," exclaimed Figgins. "I am sure I do not want fighting; I good health." The waiter took his accustomed duty attending guests. The diver, Jack's request, summoned Thyra, whose classic features, slender form, Eastern garb, well keeping scene around. A seat honour kept her _al fresco_ banquet, Jack gallantly conducted her. No one could doubt her love him, shone her slightest action, her words, look, tone. It seemed pity he could return it, otherwise studied politeness consideration. To his side, hear sound his voice, her greatest happiness, made her forget dangers troubles. When towards conclusion meal, Jack proceeded to-- "Fill high bowl Samian wine," hand Thyra, her moment supreme pleasure. Her dark eyes sparkled, her soft cheek flushed, her jewelled fingers trembled held crystal glass, filled what, his sake, independent nature, her nectar gods. "Hark! What noise that?" asked Jack, suddenness, Thyra spilt wine ere could reach her lips. There indeed sound street like blended hum many voices, tread many feet, moment becoming louder. "Perhaps procession," said Harry Girdwood. "Or march round troops new pasha," said Mole. "Oh, I pity him." "No, there is something dreadful that, I sure," exclaimed orphan. "Oh, terrible country. I will go home to-morrow they will let me." "Here, Tinker, black son gun; go roof, see what is matter," said Jack. The nigger ascended nimbly monkey. At moment thundering knock came outer gate. "What want?" asked Bogey, still acting porter. "Open, name pasha," said stern voice outside. Bogey replied not, ran his master. Tinker he arrived breathless moment. "Awful lot soldiers--Turks--outside, big guns swords, massa," said Tinker. "Wants come here, too," added Bogey. "Hark! Oh, are not giving door? They are again, a-hammerin' away." And thundering knocking repeated louder before, stern voice demanding Thyra, slave. "Just I feared," cried Jack; "they have found Thyra is, come drag her back." "Oh, powers Heaven, protect us all!" she exclaimed, nervously clutching Jack's arm. "Am I unfortunate enough, dear Jack, brought great peril? I entreat save surrendering me; one favour; let one number shoot dead soon I enemy's hands." "Impossible, dear Thyra!" said Jack. "Do think, Boy England, possible act cowardly way? No; must make gallant resistance. Surely well prepared; arms enough all. Where is Irish diver?" "Here, honour, ready row that is going." "Mr. Mole, handle gun," said Jack; "here one suit you." The waiter orphan also accommodated weapons, orphan thought he would rather load guns fire off. "Quick! get movables, place gate," said Jack. "With strength, bolts, bars, keys, barricade behind it, defy band Turks, sultan himself." All gave cheer defiant words, proceeded impromptu fortification great vigour. "I will go roof reconnoitre," said Harry. And dangerous duty, he proceeded great alacrity. In moments he came down, much consternation his face. "This bad job, Jack," he said; "worse I thought." "How?" asked hero. "We accused murdering pasha, well carrying young Greek girl. There hundred pasha's troops guard outside, scoundrel Abdullah head them, thousands wild Moslem fanatics, thirsting blood." "I go see myself," cried young Jack. "For Heaven's sake, do not," said Harry, restraining him; "it certain death, you, leader, particular object animosity." Thyra's entreaties even pressing. She threw her arms round Jack's neck, earnestly entreated risk his life. "Dear Thyra," cried Jack, "you shall taken. I must protect you." He sprang stairway, soon roof. It sight indeed appal stoutest heart. As far eye could reach excited crowd, restless, furious, thirsting vengeance. In front body troops, Turkish uniform, led captain guard whose side could recognised sinister countenance Abdullah. They caught sight Jack Harkaway. He recognised. A shout burst thousand throats; deep, angry cry, like roar tempestuous sea. Thousands eyes flashed upon him--the eyeballs gleaming white dusky skins. "The murderer pasha--the despoiler harem!" cried. "Death, death him, Christians!" Jack endeavoured parley them; useless, silence obtained commands captain guard Abdullah, called Jack-- "Resistance useless; surrender once, I answer life." "If want me, must come fetch me," returned dauntless Jack. "Your blood upon head, then," said Abdullah. The captain gave word command, battering, suspended, recommenced upon door below. CHAPTER LXXXIV. THE SIEGE--THE ESCAPE--A DESPERATE RUSE. Jack left his dangerous elevation, returned his friends. "Quite bad be," he said; "there is nothing make desperate resistance, die game." The yells shouts crowd outside like combined roar large herd wild beasts. The blows became furious door. It quivered beneath repeated shocks; strength, fastenings, particularly barricade behind it, still defied efforts besiegers. Suddenly hammering ceased, yells crowd subsided. Then came volley musketry. They firing door. The volleys came thick fast; woodwork, strong was, began penetrated bullets. It clear place would soon untenable. Should besiegers enter, hope escape would over. "At least, we will return fire," said Jack. The windows wall facing street mere loopholes. At these, Jack commanded one his men take his stand, pick enemy rifle. It dangerous game, served purpose. Several besiegers fell well-aimed shots besieged. The Turks began think opposed considerable force well armed men. Their shots failed reach highly-placed narrow windows, many portholes fire besieged. The captain Abdullah accordingly ordered troops fall back. The excited crowd gave yell disappointment. "I believe we have defeated them, all," cried Harry Girdwood. But lull storm--a fatal presage overwhelming disaster. The Turkish commanders resolved make certain victory bringing cannon. If, means, troops could effect entrance--and almost certain--what could stop progress. What Harkaway's mere handful men thousands would encounter! Once more, greater peril ever, Jack went housetop reconnoitre. He laid flat he might seen, yet contrived take rapid glance position. The house detached three sides; fourth side built wall mosque. Upon three sides building entirely surrounded troops. The chance escape would mosque. But effected? The wall sacred building rose high house. Jack raised examine closely. A flash--a report--and whiz bullet told he observed. A volley followed sides. It would therefore impossible his party raise ladder, thus escape roof mosque. Jack, bullets whistling thickly around him, managed crawl unhurt trapdoor descend courtyard. "Well, Jack, think situation now?" asked Harry. "Desperate, indeed." "They gave warm reception, boy," said Mr. Mole. "It warmer still capture us," said Harkaway. "Oh, gracious, gracious! shall ever get this? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I wish I London more," cried orphan, wringing his hands. His distress contrasted strongly calm, self-possessed demeanour beautiful Thyra time supreme peril. "There one thing do," said Jack. "What that?" asked Harry, anxiously. "Break wall get mosque; that is side building is not surrounded." "But impossible pierce wall that," said Harry. "We will try, events," Jack responded. "Come, boys," he added, "one last desperate effort, we will baffle  them yet." The waiter diver understood minute. Hurriedly collected tools--pickaxes, crowbars, chisels, hammers--and set work masonry. But momentary hopes soon subsided. The mortar had, course ages, become even harder stone itself. It impossible make impression upon it. When saw this, disappointment depicted upon every countenance. Jack flung down, sheer despair, chisel he attempted break mortar. As implement fell upon stones courtyard, Thyra's quick ear noticed peculiar sound. "It hollow beneath here," she exclaimed, eagerly. Again testing floor way, became convinced she right. There probably vaults beneath courtyard, stone concealed entrance them. Animated fresh hope, party worked away, minutes lifted ponderous flagstone. A flight rude steps, leading utter darkness, discovered. "As I thought," cried Jack, "these vaults; may baffle all. Bogey, run immediately see like." Bogey hesitated moment, skipped rude steps disappeared. The others waited his return great anxiety. At moment, shout triumph raised enemies outside. It signified cannon brought, attack would soon recommence. The hope escape still slightest. In moments Bogey returned. "Well?" asked Jack. "All cellars, massa, going along--oh, miles miles de earth, dark, 'cepting bit light comes little holes de roof. Plenty room hide us, sar. Oh, golly, will not de nasty Turks go mad?" "Hurrah! go immediately," said Jack. "Now then, ladies first. Harry, I commend Thyra care. Take her down." "I not, leave you, dear Jack," she cried, desperately clinging hero. "No, no; I soon you. For Heaven's sake. Thyra, hesitate now, shall lost. Go quietly; wish." Thyra resisted more, Harry's assistance descended steps vault. "Now, Mr. Mole, go," said Jack. "Here, Figgins, take his legs go first, they will running away again. Tinker, follow behind, supporting his head." But Mr. Mole objected arrangement. "What! think I am infant, need carrying?" he said, offended dignity. "No, though I got patent self-controlling cork legs, I walk myself." And prove this, he began jauntily descending steps. But next moment he lost his footing, cry, tumbled right bottom, body unfortunate orphan. Luckily, far fall, Mr. Mole little hurt, though Figgins got worst it. "Now, boys, go," cried Jack. "Hark! battering gate artillery." At moment ball tore doorway, shattered top barricade, length lodged solid masonry. Yells triumph broke Turks. "Quick! Tinker, Bogey, lives!" cried Jack. "Is desart ye!" cried Irish diver. "No, Mr. Jack, I will see first." "Please make haste," said Jack almost imploringly. "Of course I shall save myself; I am captain, know, I must not leave ship till last." Thus reassured, rest descended, sooner last safe vault, Jack Harkaway shut stone place, thus closing opening. Then he hastily laid earth interstices round it, tried efface signs recently removed. With equal rapidity, he gathered crowbars, chisels, etc. All time firing continued. The door would soon give way enemy pour courtyard. Was hero mad, thus remain behind his friends escaped? No. His conduct part desperate deep-laid design. He saw he followed rapid flight, Turks would sure perceive stone removed, would enable discover retreat whole party. By remaining outside, he could restore stone original appearance. And he done. But his safety? He thought that, too. Wild desperate his scheme--one required far ordinary courage accomplish--gathering tools, he re-entered house, rapidly ascended his room. Here, window, he could perceive much crowd enemies increased outside. He almost shaken his feet another discharge artillery. But every second precious. Hastily Jack robed ordinary garb middle-class Turk--for he plenty Oriental garments--bound turban round his brows, rubbed his face chemical powder, greatly darkened his complexion. He quickly stained his eyebrows deep black, henna. None his friends could recognised Jack Harkaway. But his enemies deceived eluded? Having completed hasty transformation, Jack descended stairs. He looked courtyard. A third discharge artillery broken door, troops rapidly clearing away obstacles entering body. Loud shouts triumph, Jack recognised countenance Abdullah, lit savage satisfaction. But glance sufficed. Jack retired smaller garden back, he completely concealed thick shrubs. In moments, troops yard, probing seeking every corner. Just Jack calculated, soldiers followed wild helter-skelter Turks, ages conditions, fanatical Moslems, ready raze ground accursed house Christians taken refuge. The soldiers considerably surprised find one. They sought every room vain, intense disappointment. Abdullah's fury terrible witness. Speedily whole house filled motley Turkish rabble. In fact consisted Jack's safety. Seeing moment number Turks passing his hiding-place, he stepped mingled them. In confusion, nobody noticed him. In appearance, he like score wild Turkish youths throng, shouting lustily "Death Christians!" cry Jack joined great vigour. The crisis his danger over. He follow movements crowd, join first group who, tired search, went back gate. This soon happened, amongst disappointed Turks, Jack Harkaway moment conspicuous. Mingling crowd outside, Jack soon found opportunity slipping side lane, reaching suburbs town. He free, his disguise still protecting him. He increased his speed, making towards desert. For dwelt tribe Arabs he friendly, hated new pasha much old one, would sure extend assistance gallant young Englishman, enable rescue his friends. They received kindly. Jack told his story--in powerfully interested--but told nothing could done chief returned. In meantime, hero overcome excitement fatigue deep sleep fell upon him, despite his efforts keep off. CHAPTER LXXXV. ADVENTURES IN THE VAULTS--NEW FRIENDS--JACK AGREEABLY SURPRISED. We must follow Jack's friends subterranean flight. They were, fact, remains ancient long-disused fortifications, far greater antiquity edifice built them. Light air admitted small gratings sides roofing, level ground outside. As soon party got confusion hurried concealment, Harry Girdwood took lead. Their greatest distress loss Jack Harkaway. That he soon became evident. And shut outside would certain death him, seemed equally so. Thyra could means consoled. Her grief separation Jack took form intense violent lamentations. She declared she known Jack would thus left outside, consideration would induced her enter vaults. In her frenzy despair her love him, she resolved go back perish him. But her efforts inadequate raise stone already resisted greater strength Harry Girdwood. As soon Greek girl could least degree pacified, party proceeded vaults, Harry reminding means danger, outlet, least secure retreat might discovered. It great drawback lamp candle, Tinker box matches, lighting one every yards, enabled gain idea place in. In way penetrated considerable distance, till arriving kind wide underground room, party rested awhile. Harry Girdwood proposed go explore portion subterranean region. Leaving, therefore, others resting, he took box matches, entered passage. He soon found low rugged opening, another passage branched off. Going this, Harry almost sent falling his face making false step, he see passage lay foot lower other. Then he struck one his matches, light perceived passage lower, narrower, rugged winding rest vaults, seemed hewn earth, rather built it. "Perhaps leads cave," he thought, "inhabited robbers wild beasts. In case I shall come badly. I ought brought Bogey me; he is ugly enough frighten body. Never mind, goes." And grasping his cutlass one hand, piece lighted paper, he twisted form torch, Harry Girdwood marched manfully on. Grazing his head jutting piece rock reminded passage growing small, behoved stop. Suddenly Harry stopped. He heard voices. He saw gleam light end passage. He apparently approaching robbers' lair. Here fresh peril. But still time draw back it. No; urged curiosity, Harry determined see know worst. In moments curiosity gratified. He came point narrow, winding passage terminated, leading lofty, rugged vault fitted rude imitation room. Here, seated upon floor group dozen men, armed, dress appearance evidently Bedouin Arabs. Harry reassured. He knew Arabs enemies Turks. The sharp eyes quick ears one sons desert soon "spotted" stranger, he could resist retreat, gave alarm. Two seized secured him. Harry feared his curiosity would cost dear. Questioned chief, Harry, dint words signs, explained occurred. The Bedouins became friendly. They ever ready help even unbelieving Christians still hated Turks. Two number therefore told accompany Harry back. By aid torch, three soon found way rest party, astonished alarmed ferocious appearance intending deliverers. Indeed, waiter diver drew weapons prepared offer resistance, Harry stepped forward explained Arabs friends. Thyra, could speak perfectly Turkish Arabic, acted interpreter, gave full account occurred, seemed impress Bedouins greatly. The beauty speaker produced powerful effect upon young gallant chief Thyra particularly addressed herself. "Oh, brave sheikh," she exclaimed, "hasten assist young Englishman I love, fallen hands generously saving his friends." "Lady, beautiful peri gate Heaven," replied chief, Kara-al-Zariel, "I warriors tribe protect thee thy friends." Thyra knelt kissed hem Arab chief's garment humble gratitude. He raised her ground. As he so, deepest admiration shone his dark luminous eyes. But Thyra felt love young Jack. "We even debating attack Turks," said Arab, "Ibrahim enemy; thy words, would appear strong many, armed weapons western science. In desert, fear neither men, kings, armies, cities strength availeth not." "But least fly assistance brave Jack," implored Thyra. "It late; already castle hands pasha's men, friend doubtless captive!" "But rescue him?" entreated Thyra; "promise us that." "I promise make attempt, fair maiden," answered Kara-al Zariel; "but must night stealth." "That hope gives comfort," exclaimed Thyra. "Thou seemest greatly love Frankish youth," observed chief, bending his dark eyes upon her; "if so, he much envied." "Gallant emir," said Harry, addressing Al-Zariel juncture, "is cave safe entrance common enemy?" "Safe top Caucasus, far concerned," chief answered. "The Turks know vaults, did, would venture mercy. It vaults intended enter take town surprise." "But end lead to?" asked Harry. "Into native desert, opening concealed dense shrubbery," replied Al-Zariel. "We often found caves useful excursions Turks. But friends shall accompany us tents, Turks bold indeed seek you." Harry thanked generous offer. This arrangement made, party quitted caves means narrow path leading two walls high rock. Two chief's men, disguised Turks, left behind enter town keep eye upon condition affairs there. The chief course took command party. He seemed make Thyra especial object his care. It evidently case "love first sight" towards her been, equal suddenness, smitten Jack Harkaway. And attachments equally hopeless. In parts path narrow difficulty could squeeze it. This rugged path proved particularly difficult Mr. Mole, whose head was, usual, entirely free fumes alcohol, whose ungovernable legs still insisted upon going ways right one. But his Arab friends occasionally assisted his progress prodding back long spears, species incitement he could well dispensed with, insisted upon affording. The poor orphan, too, was, usual, bowed weight woe. "Oh, cold I having," he exclaimed, pathetically, feeling his pocket handkerchief. "It is tumbling fountain it. Oh, dear, shall I do? It death, I know will." Such burden his lament, greatly amused others, especially Bogey Tinker. They edge desert distance outside walls town. The Arab tents could faintly descried distance. They still distance walk order reach them. The road, however, plain easy, consisting usual flat desert sand. On nearing encampment, challenged Bedouin sentinel, chief, stepping forward explaining, whole group course readily admitted. The black white camel-hair tents dotted plain considerable distance, numerous horses camels picketed round. One principal Arabs conferred Kara-al-Zariel, he went back his English guests, saying-- "Christian friends, I show cheer hearts even flesh lambs, odour pure bread. Behold!" And throwing back curtains tent, he exposed Jack Harkaway, attired Turk, peacefully sleeping upon rude couch. The astonishment relief mind experienced friends discovery cannot described. Their joy finding Jack safe equal wonder he escaped. But words denote ecstasy Thyra? With cry delight, she ran towards him, kneeling beside his couch, poured forth thanksgivings Heaven his deliverance. This caused jealousy noble chief, began perceive passionately "Pearl Isles," he called beautiful Greek, enamoured youthful Briton. "Stay," he said, Thyra passionately impressed her lips brow sleeping youth. "Stay, wake him. The Christian sleeps slumber weary; disturb not, his waking joyous." "Thou sayest right," answered Thyra. "If he happy, sleeping waking, it is intrude upon his happiness. But I sit watch his slumbers, I may first greet he wakes." "You must not thing kind, miss!" interposed waiter. "Girls cannot live upon love, though seem inclined try it, we have got nice supper awaiting us tent, Mr. Girdwood insists upon coming join us." With difficulty Thyra induced assent, left object her idolatry sleeping blissful unconsciousness her presence. A short time, however, elapsed before, either awakened outward sound disturbed dream, young Jack started up, much confused puzzled find strange place. Then he remembered events day. "Halloa! what is that?" Could he believe his eyes, possible that, beyond group Bedouins sitting feasting around camp fire, another group, among figures Harry Girdwood, Mole, Thyra conspicuous? It must dream. Jack leapt his feet, fixed his eyes group, recognised also Mr. Figgins, Will-of-the-Wisp forms Bogey Tinker flitting waiting others. Now convinced, Jack rushed his tent larger one. A perfect storm welcome greeted him, mutual surprise delight exhibited all. Thyra beside herself joy. "Oh, dear Jack," said she, "I thought never see more." "How get away Turks?" asked Harry Girdwood two three others chorus. Jack told his story, turn listened his companions' adventures, mutual congratulations upon escape. Never Jack's wanderings happier occasion reunion. CHAPTER LXXXVI. THE GREEK GIRL'S FOREBODING--A BATTLE WITH THE TURKS. Thyra slept little night. This could she unwearied frame, toils, anxieties, dangers day sufficient exhaust far greater strength hers. It she much anxiety mind. Jack safe--that her, first consideration, his friends, including herself, rescued his cleverness imminent perils beset them. But her soul state great agitation; dark, melancholy thoughts, would chased away, continually oppressed it. This interfered blissful visions, roseate castles air she prone build, Jack Harkaway ever formed central figure. If she could win his love, accompany England--a grand mysterious region she her life longed see--Thyra thought climax happiness would reached. But still she felt terrible presentiment that, would never accomplished, dread imminent fate hanging her. "To-morrow," she murmured, "the hand destiny lie heavily upon me; voice within tells so." And melancholy condition continued throughout hours darkness. She looked her tent. All around her slept. Even sentinel fallen asleep beside camp fire. The air laden chill breath night, stars fading first gleams dawn breaking eastern mists. At time appearance vast desert especially gloomy depressing. Thyra turned her gaze direction town. What cloud coming thence, advancing along plain towards camp? The Greek girl strained her eyes penetrate mist; she assisted growing light morn. Presently cloud shaped recognisable distinctness. It mass armed men. The Turks marching track! Thyra's terror moment kept her spellbound. This onset boded destruction herself her friends; all, she loved best. Involuntarily she uttered cry alarm, aroused whole camp. The Arabs sprang feet, seized arms. In instant commotion. Kara-al-Zariel heard beloved voice, instant Thyra's side. "What alarmed Pearl Isles?" he asked, poetic phraseology his race. Thyra stood dishevelled hair, dilated eyes fixed upon approaching army, she pointed trembling fingers. "Look! look!" she exclaimed, "they coming--the Turks upon us!" Kara-al-Zariel followed her gaze. He saw cloud; he knew danger. "To horse!" he thundered. "To arms! every son desert, every Christian guest!" Instantly horses untethered, riders mounted; armed men assembled foot, every warrior appeared readiness. Jack Harkaway his friend Harry, time familiar old soldiers sudden calls arms, soon answered summons; rest party, hearing danger, backward preparing it. There encampment large number fleet Arab steeds, actually required tribe, chief, like many his race, dealt largely horseflesh. This particularly fortunate present occasion, Christian allies could also mounted, overwhelmingly outnumbered enemy, could save flight. All experienced warriors sent front, face first shock coming attack. Kara-al-Zariel led beautiful steed Thyra. "Mount, sweet maiden," he said; "This steed one fleetest. Go, ride towards sea, enemies coming fast upon us, place thee." Thyra mounted, steadfastly refused flight. "Thinkest thou, O chief, I fly danger?" she said scornfully. "Never! I escape best friends, perish them." In vain emir persuaded her seek safety once. "To perish fall hands licentious Turks," he said; "remember, rash girl, two terrible fates menace thee." "If I killed," responded Thyra, "it Heaven; ere I become captive Turks, dagger shall end life." Her resolution evidently fixed, Arab chief ceased persuade, resolved, throughout coming fight, he could shield her danger. On came enemy's forces. The light sufficient perceived consisted large well-armed body Turkish cavalry. They led, before, captain guard, truculent vizier Abdullah. If latter's acuteness vaults beneath castle discovered, conjecturing fugitives escaped thus, he traced desert. He, therefore, organized expedition set surprise camp. Abdullah's plans deeply laid. He wished capture Greek girl, he might curry favour Pasha Ibrahim presenting her him. He resolved secure punish Harkaway Christians, turn away every public suspicion Ibrahim, late pasha's assassination. After that, exceedingly probable unscrupulous interpreter meant way destroy Ibrahim, set pasha himself. These subtle treacheries common corruptions Oriental rule. The vizier intended take Arabs surprise, he would succeeded this, Thyra. Instead, therefore, finding sleeping encampment, he found whole tribe arms, ready receive him. Other tactics therefore necessary, Abdullah believed his superiority numbers would ensure victory. As Turkish regiment approached, spread out, object surround force opposed them. On came Turks. Their sabres flashing clashing. The steeds neighing. The sands desert rising clouds beneath thundering tread. Arrived within short distance, two armies halted surveyed other. Then trumpet sounded parley, messenger rode forward communicate Arab chief. "To Emir Kara-al Zariel," said soldier, "thus saith great Lord Ibrahim, pasha Alla-hissar. Whereas, though thou hast often rebel his highness's lawful authority, yet he pardon thee past misdeeds condition thou shalt give Frankish men Greek woman, accused secret murder his late highness, Moley Pasha. Refuse this, mercy shown thee thy tribe. "Tell thy ruler his officers," thus replied Kara-al Zariel, "that I refuse his proffered pardon; Ibrahim assassin usurper I despise defy; I never deliver his hands sought hospitality, I tribe, guests, resist his, death." This rebuff sufficiently conclusive. There nothing commence fight. Shots came forth midst mass Turkish horsemen, promptly answered muskets Arabs. The battle cry Bedouins rang clear morning air. The first rays sun lit plain, piercing clouds mist desert-dust, gleaming upon rapidly-moving blades barrels. Now shone white _naiks_ Arabs red caps Turks. The Ottoman cavalry pressed terrible force upon Bedouins, whose old-fashioned long guns inadequate compete modern European rifles foe. But side, bullets tore ranks laid low many gallant warrior. The fray soon became fierce close one. A fight, hand hand, muzzle muzzle, sword sword. One slight advantage side Arabs. They horses quite fresh, Turks chargers wearied long difficult march. Our friends forget Englishmen, upheld honour country personal bravery showed upon occasion. Jack Harkaway Harry Girdwood hewed way right left among Turkish horsemen. They like mowers among corn, sickles sharp, harvest heavy. Soon shone morning sun brightly upon scene strife. The Turks, numbers, could relieve comrades became tired. The Arabs advantage. They began thin terribly. But still fought unabated vigour, succeeded preventing enemy surrounding encampment, enclosing in. Kara-al-Zariel ever thickest perilous part contest, encouraging his men his presence. He performed prodigies valour, his long hiltless Arab sabre stained deeply blood his foes. The diver waiter showed skilful valorous fighting, Mole Figgins failed distinguish much, preferred modest retiring rearguard army, must consider weak nerves one wooden legs other. Bogey Tinker element, African blood spurred deeds bravery sometimes even approaching barbarity. Thyra, stationed horseback rear, her spirit heroism, her will, would led her front battle. But entreaties chief Jack induced her restrain her valour, remain position comparative safety she could see went on, discharge pistol she saw chance bringing foe. But degrees Arabs ranks broken. Their numbers fearfully diminished, efforts seemed make perceptible diminution enemy. So chief resolved upon retreat. But ere could effected, Turks succeeded placing large contingent position intercept them. "We must cut them, lost," exclaimed chief. The war-cry Arabs raised. They dashed portion living ring surrounded them. They cut way circling mass steel. CHAPTER LXXXVII. STILL THE BATTLE RAGES. At moment Kara-al-Zariel's horse received mortal wound, sank beneath chief. He fell heavily, narrowly escaped trampled death his advancing men. But procuring another steed, he led van. Jack Harkaway already two horses killed him. He disfigured blood smoke, dizzy weariness excitement, he still fought like lion, life. The task breaking Turkish ranks terrible one. Many Arabs fell dead desperate attempt. As fast gaps made ranks enemy, filled fresh men. The horses trampled upon weary limbs wounded. Into wild _mêlée_ Jack plunged, closely followed his friend Harry. Our hero struck gigantic Turk, fired revolver face another, gave cut right left his sword. Taking advantage passage thus made, Englishmen rapidly followed leader. Thyra led waiter diver, Mole Figgins mutually assisted other. It amid shots falling like hail every direction, menaced killing blows heavy sabres retreat made. Thyra performed another act heroism juncture. A Turkish sergeant, foot, fired straight her she passed. By width scarce inch, bullet missed piercing her brain, she answered shot sought found heart Turk, he fell dead instantaneously. In way Englishmen got ranks foe joined chief. The rest Arabs followed, hard task so, enemy overwhelmingly outnumbered reduced force. But friends escape even thus easily. The Turks made fresh vigorous efforts, prevent retreat, effect capture. Seeing peril in, Jack called Thyra said-- "My good girl, acted heroic bravery, danger greater ever, must quit scene." "Never, dear Jack, whilst imperilled," she firmly replied. "But aid way staying," he said. "Listen, yonder sea, two miles off. There English ship bay; gallant sailors fail assist countrymen distress. Go once, steed swiftest all. Ride, ride life, dear girl." Thyra needed urging. "I bring assistance you," she cried, "or perish attempt." She turned her steed, minute lightning speed. On came Turks, headed Abdullah, his comrade, captain guard, desperately wounded. "We must capture them!" he cried his men. "Forward, men; death victory." Jack his men saw resistance useless overwhelming force. Flight chance remaining them. Yet could give without attempt punish enemy. Jack levelled his pistol vizier's head, dexterous movement he avoided shot. "Yield, Christian dogs!" he thundered. "Yield might right, capture death inevitable." "You know us Boys England," cried Jack. "We may taken dead, breath life remains, never surrender black-hearted Turks." The vizier answered ordering his men surround Christians, best accomplish. But agile movement, Jack his friends suddenly turned galloped off. It direction sea, retreat present cut way, across desert fled. "Forward!" cried Abdullah. "They must escape us." For considerable time chase continued, till English, "doubling" again, changed direction flight, made towards sea. Hope arose within hearts, saw considerable number well-armed English sailors, led Thyra, coming towards them. A minutes' galloping joined welcome allies, reinforcement enabled Jack defy Turks. The latter drew rein, stood awhile hesitation. This unexpected turn affairs evidently disconcerted them. But ere horses could put motion again, Jack his party upon them, backed new allies. The impetuosity charge moment irresistible. They bore Turks them. The Turkish troopers recoiled flight rocket. Jack rode like hero old. His hair streamed wind he darted air his noble Arab steed. His eyes flashed fire, struck awe foe approached him. But he soon found surrounded his enemies. Abdullah, head, cast upon Jack. Their horses driven haunches force shock. Half dozen sabres circled round Jack's head. Abdullah made lunge his sword, would proved death Jack Harry Girdwood instant caught thrust upon his arm. Poor Harry! His devotion his friend cost dear. He reeled, would fallen his saddle, probably trampled death, Bogey, risk his life, caught led his horse apart thick battle. Burning avenge his friend, Jack struck his force Abdullah's head. The interpreter received blow upon his sword, which, proving stronger two, Jack's weapon snapped clash, he left weaponless. He seemed, indeed, mercy his pitiless foe. Abdullah smiled cruel smile he raised his sabre. But smile his last. A lance-head gleamed past Jack, transfixed Abdullah chest, he borne among trampling hoofs horses. "Yah, yah; dat's one me, Massa Jack," exclaimed Tinker, he thus saved Jack's life. Jack caught Abdullah's sword, and, desperate charge, cut opposing Turks, "demoralised" loss leader, regained his Bedouin English friends. By time heat great. The sky like dome steel. The sands desert burnt fierce sun. The dust flew clouds, save blood wounded dying soaked arid soil. Taking advantage confusion reigned Turkish force, English Arabs made last desperate effort escape foes. With yell defiance, fierce Bedouins, led Kara-al-Zariel, dashed ranks enemy, dealing destruction right left. Taking advantage disconcerted state foe, Jack his friends enabled join Arab allies, retreat whole party towards shore began good earnest. They would soon distanced exhausted foes, ere English vessel could reached, another large body Turks came attack. This force led less personage Pasha Ibrahim himself, whose fierce grey eyes glared beneath his shaggy brows slain his vizier. Beside rode officer command his squadron, another young man, whom, although dressed red _fez_ Turkish uniform, Jack recognised Herbert Murray. He attended his servant Chivey, also dressed Turk. They splendidly mounted; horses fresh, troops well-disciplined. As two parties approached, pasha's eyes fixed upon Thyra. "It Pearl Isles," he exclaimed, "who stolen infidels harem. She shall yet mine. One thousand piastres man capture her." A dozen his men instantly started pursuit Thyra, little advance her companions. Her beautiful Arab steed seemed taken sudden fright, started lightning speed, independent Thyra's attempts turn him, she wished die escape side her companions. Separated them, pursued dozen well-armed men, her position indeed perilous. The speed her horse seemed her chance. But noble creature hard worked day, first "spurt," showed signs exhaustion. The Turks, upon fresh fleet steeds, began gain upon her every minute. At length she bay, resolved die defending herself defying her enemies. She placed her lance rest foremost Turk came up. Despite his efforts avoid weapon, she thrust his shoulder. He fell, desperately, mortally wounded, full rage defeated woman. His nearest companion faced beautiful amazon, rapidly drew her revolver--the one Jack given her--and fired. The ball took effect, Turk reeled his saddle fell ground, dead. The others approached. But Thyra discharged one, two, three shots her revolver, last killed officer's horse, staggered fell, bringing rider ground. Thyra urged her steed towards sea. Herbert Murray Chivey pressed forward, resolved try gain pasha's reward glory achieving her capture. Away went Thyra her gallant steed. She near sea now. The murmur waves upon sands resounded her ears. The British cruiser seen mile away offing, shore stood half dozen sailors, taking charge boats armed force come ashore. They anxiously watching companions return, perceiving Thyra's peril, two went her assistance. And arrived moment soon. Herbert Murray ridden her. Grasping bridle her steed, he thought he effected her capture. But moment voice beside cried English-- "Hands there, lubber!" This showed Thyra's call help heard responded to. Murray turned, saw two stalwart British tars standing beside Thyra. "Look here," continued sailor, "if do not leave young lady alone, instanter, we will take aboard let captain deal you." Herbert Murray looked around, seeing sailors position carry threat, angrily relinquished chase, turning his horse, rode Chivey, approached quite near. CHAPTER LXXXVIII. END OF THE CONTEST--DEATH OF THYRA. Thyra securely protected gallant tars rest party came up, long, slight skirmish, Jack his friends managed cut new force opposing Turks, make way towards ship. Ibrahim Pasha, enraged thus defied, still pressed on, followed his force, arrived shore time see Jack others embarking boats. He recourse threats. "In name His Imperial Majesty Sultan," he said officer command, "I command give Englishmen, escaped justice." "They British subjects," returned officer, "who sought protection flag." "Shall British subjects commit crime yet go free?" inquired Ibrahim. "What crime committed?" asked officer. "Murder--the assassination his highness, Moley Pasha." "What evidence show connect his death?" asked officer. "If sufficient evidence, shall tried proper tribunal. Where English flag floats, justice shall done all." The pasha bit his lip. He knew his evidence Englishmen slight, fact assertion Murray Chivey, mistake his part would bring political trouble might his ruin, he began draw in. "At least," he said, "you refuse give back property, stolen palace." "That is reasonable request enough," answered lieutenant. "Point property, shall it." "There is," exclaimed Ibrahim, he pointed Thyra. "That property, eh?" said astonished officer. "Well, nice property too. But she stolen?" "Stolen harem son Eblis!" cried old pasha, pointing Jack. "Ah, young man, I see is," said officer, gravely shaking his head; "you have going rather fast, brought trouble account Greek girl." "It is lie," cried Jack, looking fiercely pasha; "she never stolen, never belong old coffee-coloured villain, what is more, never shall, Britons protect her. She fled her accord palace Moley Pasha, he arrived, sought protection friends town." "In case," said officer, "we cannot give her up, British government recognise slavery, domestic otherwise. Under flag she free." A cheer defiance group English sailors greeted speech. "By soul prophet," fiercely exclaimed pasha, "am I defied boy, infidel--a son Sheitan, boot?" "Boy I am, I defy you," retorted Jack. This bold, foolish incautious speech, destined disastrous. The pasha, goaded madness Jack's words defiant manner, drew his pistol discharged pointblank hero. The action rapid one--so rapid take Jack unawares, rapid love-quickened perceptions Thyra. She saw pasha's movement, throwing herself forward, seized Jack time draw aside. By doing, she saved his life, expense her own. The bullet lodged her breast, cry she fell wounded Jack's arms. The disaster come quickly hero scarcely comprehended happened. The pasha frowned darkly he saw Thyra fall. Some remorse awakened, even his iron heart. He intended take life, hers, indeed Pearl Isles lost evermore. "It Is now, pasha, committed crime," said lieutenant, "and I call account. Surrender answer deed." "Surrender Christian dogs! Never," answered fierce Ibrahim. "Then, men, fire upon Turks," said officer. The rifles sailors accordingly brought cover upon pasha's force. Ibrahim immediately recognised fresh imminent danger, resolved retreat. Turning his horse, he gave signal his followers, whole body marched rapidly, pursued fire English. During parley, Kara-al-Zariel his Arabs taken advantage preoccupation foes, withdraw range rugged rocks near shore, would shelter attacks Turks give advantage near English allies ship. But pasha, main objects his expedition escaped him, make attempts pursue Bedouins. He remnant his forces made best way across desert town. And attention drawn towards Thyra. All perceived, deepest regret, her hours numbered. She day thick one deadly conflict. Hundreds bullets passed her, one, aimed another, successfully performed errand death. Terrible indeed grief Jack Harkaway. "Oh, Thyra," he exclaimed, "my brave, dear girl, he killed you." "I know it," she replied, mournful resignation, "but thank Heaven you, dear Jack, saved." "I deserved devotion you," said Jack, broken accents, tears fell his eyes, "but must not--shall die thus. Can nothing done her?" he asked, looking round others. "I fear not," replied lieutenant, "but she must taken board, placed care surgeon." Thyra lifted her wound staunched her scarf. "Here, Harry," said hero, rousing his grief, "help carry her boat." But ere his friend could fulfil his request, tall, wild form interposed them, brown, sinewy hand convulsively clutched Jack's arm draw away. "No hand mine," cried voice broken intense grief, "shall bear Pearl Isles yonder boat." It Arab chief, Al-Zariel, his face haggard grief, his dark eyes gazing mournfully pale beautiful face her he loved. He raised her tenderly, wild warrior desert--tenderly child, disdained aid, bore her his strong arms boat. The others drew back; one moment heart say nay. Even rough sailors, still rougher Arabs, touched mournful scene them. It indeed solemn procession boats, almost funeral _cortége_, bore one, who, though yet dead, would never see another day's sun arise. Kara-al-Zariel gently deposited dying girl boat. "I known her day," murmured Arab chief, "and day she shone upon path like gleam sunshine gates Paradise. From first instant I saw her I loved her I loved other, I shall love life's end." He stooped imprinted passionate kiss upon marble brow, pressing he lifeless hand, gazing fast-fixing eyes, murmuring "Farewell" his native tongue. She understood him, smile gratitude, answered language. The boat put off. Kara-al-Zariel, standing sands, watched moments, then, unable longer bear sight, turned away, knelt upon beach, covered his eyes his hands. It grief alone made kneel beneath open vault Heaven. In terrible moment he registered Heaven vow vengeance pasha slain Pearl Isles. The sturdy tars bent oars, boat left murmuring waters sunlit Mediterranean. Arriving ship, Thyra placed care tenderness upon deck. The doctor examined wound, shook his head gravely. "I nothing here!" he said, subdued tones. None answered him; saw plainly his words final. Poor Jack Harkaway! If ever his young life he felt grief, now, he saw one hopelessly loved him, dying love. "I afraid die," said Thyra, her low, faint voice, "and die way best all; future life might made unhappy." "Unhappy! How could be, Thyra?" asked Jack, he knelt beside her, his hand clasped hers, her dying eyes looking upwards his face. "Because love given another," she sighed, "and, therefore, mine hopeless; oh, may other--whoever she may be--be ever happy love." "You died sake!" he said, "and think I feel thing deepest gratitude, tender feelings, towards you? No, dear Thyra, I love now, I before." "To hear lips," she murmured, "is die happy. All I ask now, always remember little Greek girl loved you, and--and unhappy her life, happy her death." "Remember you!" said Jack, "remember you, noble Thyra! done? Always! always! Do pain fearing I may forget you." "Then I happy still; listen. Here chain cross gold; keep remembrance me, I dead, conveyed, possible, land birth, beautiful island Naxos, parents still live. Bury there." Jack promised this, old captain ship declared he would her last request fulfilled. Thyra's strength almost exhausted, but, last effort, she raised herself Jack's supporting arms, addressed around her. "Friends," she said, "I give many, many thanks done me, protecting aiding escape. I give thanks farewell. Farewell!" she added, "to bright blue sky, golden sea, beautiful green island I born I hope rest I more." Here her voice died murmur, rest inaudible Jack. Jack stooped Arab chief done, impressed fervent kiss upon fair young face, still bent lovingly towards him. At moment he felt electric thrill convulse her frame, followed complete stillness. In last fond embrace her spirit fled. Thyra's troubles over. Two days afterwards ship, whose captain undertaken convey Jack his friends turbulent shores, touched Greek island Naxos. There Thyra's parents found, sad news child's death communicated them. She buried little cemetery close shore, amid groves cypress gardens flowers, sweet birds sing sea breezes softly murmur, lies beautiful Greek girl loved died young Jack Harkaway. And hearts heavy grief when, funeral, hoisted sail, steered westerly direction. CHAPTER LXXXIX. MARSEILLES--MR. MOLE AS A LINGUIST--AN UGLY CUSTOMER AND HIS ENGLISH CONFEDERATE--A COMPACT OF MYSTERY--MR. MARKBY PLAYS A VERY DEEP GAME--THE SHADOW OF DANGER. Our friends days sea. The weather fair, progress time slow. At length one day cry-- "Land ho!" "Which?" said hero, anxious thing would make forget his great sorrow Thyra. "I remarked 'Land ho!' Jack," said Mr. Mole, he first detected it. "And I observed 'Which?' sir," said Jack. "And unmeaning interrogation?" demanded Mr. Mole. "Your speech anomaly, Mr. Mole," responded Jack, mimicking voice his tutor his happiest manner. "Why so?" "You say question unmeaning, yet ask explanation it. If meaning it, I explain it?" "Ahem!" coughed Mr. Mole. "No matter. You much given useless arguments, Jack. I believe would argue doctor attending deathbed--yea, undertaker bury you." "That is piling on, sir," said Jack, half-reflective mood. "I dare say I shy doctor he tried prove something idiotic, must draw line doctor. I could not argue undertaker funeral, I will tell what, Mr. Mole, doubt I shall argue he puts stiff his bill put away." "Jack!" exclaimed Mr. Mole, inexpressibly shocked. "A plain deal coffin," pursued Jack, apparently lost deep calculation; "an economical coffin, half length ordinary coffin, could unscrew legs, leave someone." "That unfeeling talk funeral, dreadful!" "You joking there, I know, sir," returned Jack, "because talking mine." "Ahem!" said Mole, "do see near land?" "Quite so, quite so." "Go ask captain name port." It proved Marseilles, captain knew it, he sailing it, and, moreover, quickly ashore. Mr. Mole especially eager air his French. "You speak language?" asked Jack. Mr. Mole smiled superciliously question. "Like native, dear boy, like native," he replied. "That is good thing," said Jack, tipping wink Harry Girdwood; "for interpret round." * * * * France going one periodical upsets, good deal unnecessary bother made along coast upon landing passengers. Passports partly dispensed with, questions put fierce officials name nationality, led nothing, accepted reply implicitly truth, inconvenienced general public, Royalist, Republican, Orleanist, whoever might chance revolutionary party time being, could chuckle he told his fibs passed forbidden land. M. le Commissaire confronted Mr. Mole, barred his passage interrogate him. "_Pardon, m'sieur, veuillez bien dire votre nom?_" "What is that?" said Mole. "_Votre nom, s'il vous plait_," repeated commissaire. "Really, I have not pleasure acquaintance." "_Sapristi!_" ejaculated commissaire, one his subordinates. "_Quel type!_" "Now, Mr. Mole," said Jack, close behind old gentleman, "why do not speak up?" "I do not quite follow him." "He is asking question, know. You polly-voo like native." "Yes; precisely, Jack. But I do not follow his accent. He is peasant, I suppose." "_Votre nom!_" demanded official, rather fiercely time. "Now, then, Mr. Mole," cried voice rear, "you are stopping everyone. Get move on." "Dear, dear me!" said Mole. "What mean?" "He is asking name," said Jack, "and cannot understand it." "Oh!" "I will tell you, do not seem know word," said Jack. "_Il s'appelle Ikey Mole_," he added commissaire. "_Aîké Moll_," repeated commissaire. "_Il est Arabe?_" "_Oui, monsieur. C'est un des lieutenants du grand Abd-el-Kader._" "_Vraiment!_" exclaimed commissaire, tone mingled surprise respect. "_Passez, M'sieur Aîké Moll._"[2] [2] "He calls Ikey Mole," says Jack _commissaire de police_. "_Aîké Moll!_" repeats commissaire, pronouncing incongruous sounds nearly he can. "Why, he must Arab." To Jack, his ready impudence, replies-- "Yes, sir, he Arab. He one Abd-el-Kader's lieutenants." We need scarcely remind readers Abd-el-Kader doughty Arab chief made heroic resistance French Algiers. This satisfied commissaire, respectfully bade Mole pass on. They went on, Mole anxiously questioned Jack. "I am getting quite deaf," said he, way pretext understood conversation. "Whatever saying?" "I told name Isaac Mole, sir," returned Jack. "You said Ikey Mole, sir," retorted Mole, "and great liberty, sir." "Not all. Iké French Isaac," responded unblushing Jack. "But saying Arab?" "Arab!" repeated Jack, seeming astonishment. "Yes." "Did not hear myself." "I certainly thought I caught word Arab," said Mr. Mole, giving Jack suspicious glance. "You never made greater mistake, sir, life." "How odd." "Very." * * * * The Cannebière chief promenade Marseilles, inhabitants important seaport little proud it. Two men sat smoking cigarettes sipping lazily _grog au vin_ door one numerous cafés Cannebière. To two men invite reader's attention. One swarthy-looking Frenchman south, man decent exterior, fierce restless glance. He sort man would sooner friend enemy. A steadfast friend--an implacable foe! That read his peculiar physiognomy, odd mixture defiance fearlessness, anxious glances, frankness deceit, varied expressions passed rapid succession across his countenance. This man called Pierre Lenoir, although he known ports names. Pierre Lenoir sort Jack trades. He apprenticed engraver, shown remarkable aptitude profession, but, roving restless disposition, he ran away his employer ship board merchant vessel. After cruise two he wrecked, narrowly escaped his life. Tired sea, awhile he obtained employment medallist, his skill engraver stood good stead. From occupation he fled soon his ready adaptability made useful hand his new master, took roving life again. What he Marseilles one could positively assert. How Pierre Lenoir abundant supply ready money, progress narrative show--for connected several least exciting episodes career young Jack Harkaway. So much Pierre Lenoir. Now his companion café. He called Markby, and, his name indicates, he Englishman. Being poor French scholar, he scraped acquaintance Pierre Lenoir, chiefly account latter's proficiency English language. There little said concerning Markby's past history, reasons presently apparent. What reason he may cultivating friendship rover, Pierre Lenoir, probably show due course. * * * * "I disposed last batch five-franc pieces," said Markby. "Here proceeds." "Keep back," exclaimed Lenoir hurriedly. "What for?" "It sheer madness us seen conversing together," replied Lenoir, casting anxious glance behind his hat, he held his hand shield his features, "much less seen exchanging money--why, suicidal--nothing less." "Is danger, think?" "Do I think? Do I know? Why, place literally alive spies--_mouchards_ called here. Every second man meet _mouchard_." "Do mean it?" "Rather." "That is pleasant thing know," said Markby. "I do not agree there," replied Lenoir. "'Forewarned, forearmed,' proverb language. But tell friend countryman yours." "He is friend mine," returned Markby. "I know great traveller, one opportunities placing false----" "Hush, imprudent!" interrupted Lenoir. "Call stock. You know many French spies may passing, near may danger." Markby took hint given him, continued-- "Well, stock. He place more--he probably placed man alive. He travels _en grand seigneur_--lords high places disposes counterf----" "Stock." "Stock, regular loads. But he is wary fox--nothing approach cunning." "The man I want," exclaimed Lenoir. "This fellow could, aid, make fortune less year--a large fortune." "You sanguine," said Markby, smile. "I am, sanguine. I speak book, I know well I talking of. You must introduce me." "You running wildly," said Markby. "Did I tell he know me--that he would know he did? So careful he his brother would fail draw thing concerning way he gets his living." "_Dame!_" muttered Lenoir, "he seems precious difficult fellow approach." "Yes, subject," responded Markby; "but he is genial agreeable enough introduce accident, were, chat upon social topics generally, without vaguest reference subject nearest heart." "How shall I ever lead point?" "Easily. For instance, talk art matters. Allude gallery sculpture. Ask him, he fond bas reliefs? Tell skill medallist." "Medallist might put scent, he dreadfully wary," said Lenoir. "No fear. He would never dream thing. Medalling sort sister art interests him, he would sure bite chance. You lead little underground snuggery, need his wonderful caution end." "I see," said Lenoir, rubbing his hands. "But stay"--and his face grew bit serious--"this fellow faithful?" "True steel," responded Markby. "That is right," said Lenoir, look caused twinge uneasiness felt his companion, "for woe betide man plays false." "No fear man--man, I call him, he appearance least little lad, although he travelled world." Here Markby arose move away. "Stop bit," said Lenoir. "I forgotten ask rather important detail." "What it?" "The name fellow?" "Jack Harkaway," reply. CHAPTER XC. MARKBY'S MISSIVE--ON THE WATCH!--"SMART FELLOW, MARKBY!"--MARKBY'S MYRMIDON--THE SPY'S MISSION. The Englishman Markby gone Pierre Lenoir could question further. "Jack Harkaway?" exclaimed Lenoir; "I heard name before. Of course; I remember now. But Markby speaks lad. Why, Harkaway I remember must middle-aged man now; besides, little I knew Harkaway would show likely man purpose." Not long this, Lenoir upon point rising leaving café, commissionaire public messenger came run note his hand. "M'sieu Lenoir." "_C'est moi._" He took note found contain following words, scribbled boldly Markby-- "They coming along direction. You easily recognise them--two youths sailor dress. Follow them, stay cafés, I leave scrape acquaintance them.--M." "Markby upon _qui vive_," said Lenoir himself. "Smart fellow, Markby!" Glancing left, he saw two young sailors approaching: Pierre Lenoir made his mind once. He stepped house, intending let pass follow them, and, chance should, way, stop either cafés, he could drop seek opportunity he much desired. But he waiting young sailors came up, and, instead passing café dropped chairs door called refreshments. This Lenoir bargained for. However, use wasting time. He desired profit opportunity, he came sat next table two young Englishmen. * * * * "What is opinion Marseilles, Jack?" "Nothing great." "Ditto." "Nothing see you are sight sea, natives interesting. They appear full conceit town without least reason it. I like know really thing Marseilles warrant faintest belief place." This Pierre Lenoir's opportunity. He stepped forward. "Excuse me, gentlemen," said he. "Englishmen, I presume?" "Yes, sir," responded Jack; "are English?" "I have not honour," replied Pierre Lenoir. "You speak good English. You resided England, I suppose, long while?" "No, short time. Long enough get desire go back there." "That is kind say so. Your countrymen, rule, do not speak flattering terms _la perfide_ Albion." "And yet glad enough find refuge there." "True." "Are native Marseilles?" asked Harry. "No." "Then offended remarks?" "Not bit," replied Lenoir heartily. "The Marseillais absurdly conceited town, contains objects interest traveller." "Very few." "There some, however, accept escort, I shall happy show them." They expressed thanks courteous offer which, little pressing, glad accept. "Thanks; go tell friend, waiting us quay, he must expect us hour so." "Very good." * * * * Markby must pretty keenly upon lookout, sooner gone back he came. "Well, success?" "Just I wished," returned Lenoir, great chuckle; "they coming back directly." "That is chance; take place. Once there, please them." "There danger?" "What be!" "Only this--suppose mistaken?" Markby visibly offended this. "If think likely I told you, take advice nothing whatever them. I do not want expose risk think ought run." Lenoir appeared waver momentarily. Markby eyed anxiously awhile, Lenoir, air resolution, exclaimed-- "Hang risk. I will go neck nothing." "And take to-night." "I will." "Good! You will repent decision. They will turn little contemplate." "Right! Now you." "I am gone." And away he went. "What strange fellow Markby is," thought Pierre Lenoir, looking him. "What odd laugh he has." Alas! Pierre Lenoir good reason bear laugh mind. But must anticipate. * * * * As soon Markby fairly sight, he beckoned young man white blouse cap, walked along opposite side way, keeping Markby view without appearing notice him. The fellow blouse ran across once. "Well, how is going?" "Beautiful," returned Markby, "nothing could better. Already Harkaway his hard-knuckled companion, Girdwood, seen Lenoir's society. But day seen Caveaux themselves, proofs guilt spring hydra-headed ground." "And end in?" asked other, eagerly. "The galleys," returned Markby, fierce intensity. "Beautiful!" exclaimed man blouse, unfeigned admiration. "You always must precious sight downier I thought. Why, old man fool. He made brown two floating his coffins, he guileless pup compared you." "You keep watch," said Markby, hurriedly; "and ready emergency. It bold stroke playing for. Lenoir desperate ruffian, least mistake business would something I one do not care contemplate." "Lenoir blowed," replied man blouse; "the people I care go make mess job is, firstly--Jack Harkaway, secondly, his pal Harry Girdwood, harder fist his I seldom received unlucky snuffer-tray." And he gone. CHAPTER XCI. MARKBY'S NEXT STEP--THE PREFECT OF POLICE--THE PLOT THICKENS--A GLIMPSE OF MARKBY'S PURPOSE--A DOUBLE TRAITOR--DEADLY PERIL. Markby went muttering himself. "Wish scamp could share fate I reserved accursed Harkaway. However, I cannot manage that, I must thankful small mercies." * * * * A short walk brought Markby office prefect police, his business considerable importance, he fortunate soon obtaining interview great man himself. "This excellent opportunity," said head police, "if information thoroughly reliable, although I confess almost sounds good true." "Pardon me, monsieur," said Markby, "the expression use sounds though I got information second-hand; I principal. On 10th, please remember. I party." "It important matter," said prefect, "that I attempt disguise you. This Lenoir evidently head gigantic conspiracy. We long seeking discover he disposed his counter----" "Stock," said Markby, interrupting prefect, smile. "He quintessence caution, sir, he never alludes term." "You really think English people confidants?" "The chief confederates; yes. They heads English part scheme." "How many men require?" demanded prefect, changing subject abruptly. "A dozen fully armed, plain clothes. These descend _caveaux_ make capture." "A dozen!" "Yes." "So many!" "You do not know Lenoir," said Markby; "he is devil he is aroused. A dozen work do. As two Englishmen----" "They young," exclaimed prefect. "They young fiends. I seen fight like devils. They dangerous Lenoir. They cunning evil one himself, gammon even you, plausible tales." "Let see," said prefect, thoughtfully. "I take note names tell likely assume." "One calling Jack Harkaway." "And other?" "Harry Girdwood." "Good--and prove persons whose names assumed Turkey?" "I can." "Very good," said prefect, rising, intimate intercourse over. "Our men shall force capture." CHAPTER XCII. THE HARKAWAY'S GUIDE--LENOIR'S MUSEUM--THE CAVEAUX, AND WHAT THEY SAW THERE--THE MEDALS--THE TRUTH AT LAST--A COINER'S TRADE--AN ALARM--A DESPERATE FELLOW. "Here again, sir," said Harry Girdwood, stepping Pierre Lenoir; "but I fear taking great liberty asking _cicerone_ large party muster here." Lenoir smiled. It free, frank smile. To tell truth, he bit annoyed, besides two youths Mole, attendant darkeys them, Tinker Bogey. Lenoir cautious man, he care run risks. "Are friends confidants yours?" he asked, rather pointedly. It odd speech make, he smiled slightly, took sort joke. "Oh, yes, confidential friends," returned Harry Girdwood, smiling. "Very good, let us begin look round. We walk along quays like, thence past Hôtel de Ville. I shall show several objects undoubted interest," said Lenoir, significantly. He led way on. Jack fell back paces, walking Harry Girdwood. "He is odd fellow," whispered latter. "Very." Lenoir led town he ventured approach Caveaux. "I little museum far away," he said. "I afraid shall intruding," began Jack. "Not bit," protested Lenoir. The snuggery question situated little distance town, away main road. The cottage one-story building. "His museum extensive," whispered Harry Girdwood his companion, "if cottage." Lenoir remarkably quick-eared. "My museum cunningly arranged," he said Jack, looking his shoulder he walked on; "you do not get once. Here are." They reached threshold, opening door, he led way in. It neat little cottage interior, nothing attract attention. Passing first room, Lenoir conducted sort out-house beyond. Here came upon first surprise. He opened door apparently shut cupboard, this, intense astonishment, revealed flight stone steps seemingly led bowels earth. "Hallo!" exclaimed Jack; "why, what is this?" "I thought I astonish you, now," said Lenoir, his calm smile. "What place?" "There whole series caves these, apparently natural formations. The way I account time experimental mining operations gone there. Would like go see place?" "With pleasure," returned Jack, eagerly. "Allow lead way." When descended steps, Jack half repented. This man stranger them, he brought wild out-of-the-way place. Had he evil purpose bringing there? Jack stood wavering seconds--no more. "We four," he said himself, "four without counting Mr. Mole; must pretty tough lot frighten us much, said done." So saying he went. The others followed close behind him. At base flight steps found spacious vault unpleasantly dark. "Allow lead way now," said Lenoir, passing on. "Follow closely; fear stumbling, nothing way." So saying, he conducted opening, which, way, low stoop passing under, found narrow cave, reminded young Jack forcibly dungeon approach Sir Walter Raleigh, Tower London. "What think place?" demanded guide. "A curious sight," reply. "You put space use?" "Pardon me," said Lenoir; "I practise favorite hobby here." "Here!" "Yes--or rather next cellar beyond." "And may favourite hobby?" "Medalling," Lenoir's reply. And he shot his questioners one peculiar glances astonished before. "I like see work," said Jack. "I thought would," said Lenoir, quiet chuckle. Lenoir led way next cellar cavern, came suddenly upon complete change scene. Here saw furnace, melting pots, bars metal, moulds, files, batteries, necessary accessories manufacture medals. Upon flat stone slab pile medals, pattern precisely. "Just examine those, Mr. Harkaway," said Pierre Lenoir, "and tell think them." Jack put his finger glittering heap, fell table bright clear ring considerably astonished him. "Why, silver!" Lenoir smiled. "Very good, are not they?" "Very!" Jack made discovery, upon examining closely. "They five-franc pieces!" he said, puzzled expression. "Of course are--and beauties too!" "There is much risk getting rid those, I say?" "Risk!" iterated Harry Girdwood. "Aye!" "Why risk?" "I mean one could detect difference easily. Why, deceived you," he added, turning Jack, air conscious pride. "Upon life, I do not understand mean," said Jack. Lenoir looked serious moment. Then he burst boisterous fit merriment. "You really over-cautious, young gentleman," he said. "Over-cautious?" "Why, yes--why, yes. Wherefore reserve? Why pretend understand? Do not see," he added, cunning leer, "that I make medals perfectly Hôtel de la Monnaie, French Mint?" "So I see," said Jack. A faint light began dawn upon Harry Girdwood--not soon, reader say. "It rather dangerous pastime, Mr. Lenoir, medalling fancy yours," he said. "No," said Lenoir, pointedly, "the danger there; danger pastime, call it, disposing beautiful medals." "Dear me, sir," said Mr. Mole. "Do sell them?" "Yes." "How much?" "The five-franc pieces two francs half," replied Lenoir, "and throughout get louis, twenty-franc pieces; I seven francs. You pass without risk." This told all. Jack his friends astounded. "Are making us overtures join passing bad money?" demanded young Jack. "Not bad money," returned Lenoir, "very good money--all make." "It evident know us," said Harry Girdwood, "and considerably mistaken. Why brought us placed power, utterly beyond understand." Lenoir stared. "What!" "The position embarrassing," said Jack. "To duty would repay great ingratitude kindness guiding us town, ought denounce police authorities." This speech partook nature threat Pierre Lenoir instant. "The worst day's work life would that," he said, fiercely. "No man plays traitor Pierre Lenoir second time." "Traitor wrong term," said Jack; "we sworn share confidences yours. We shall leave now, but----" "Stop!" They moving towards entrance Lenoir sprang them, whipped brace revolvers. The position grew exciting unpleasant. "Stand way, let us pass," exclaimed Jack, impetuously. "Do not come nearer," said Lenoir, quiet determination, "for I warn would dangerous. You cannot move place made terms me." "I one nothing whatever say you," said Jack, haughtily. "I do not care bargain coiner." With his old foolhardy way he stepping forward, peril his life. Lenoir desperate man, desperate strait. His finger trembled upon trigger. "Stand back, life." "You stand aside," cried Jack. "Another step I fire!" cried Lenoir. "Bah!" Jack pushed on. Lenoir pulled trigger. Bang went. But ball whistled harmlessly Jack's head, lodged slanting roof. A friendly hand behind coiner knocked his arm nick time. At self-same instant eight ten men, fully armed, burst vault. One them, apparently command, pointed Lenoir, said others-- "Arrest man. He is leader them." And coiner could offer resistance, knocked his weapons his hands, fell upon him. But Lenoir powerful fellow--a desperate, determined man, easily disposed of. With wonderful energy, he tore them, and, producing something one his pockets, he held menacingly up. "Advance step," he exclaimed, "and I blow atoms, well. Beware! I hold lives hand. Now dares advance?" CHAPTER XCIII. LENOIR'S FLIGHT--MURRAY THE TRAITOR--HIS PUNISHMENT AND FLIGHT--A LONG RUN--THE AUBERGE--A STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE. There pause. Pierre Lenoir looked like mischief. His position desperate, judged, rightly judged, he man likely stick trifle. The men looked officer, latter, man intelligence prudence, albeit coward, reflected seriously. Several terrible calamities, accidental intentional, late opened eyes public destructive properties dynamite, his thoughts flew. He wavered. The coiner saw his chance, quick act think, he made exit. "Stand back!" he cried, fiercely, men made faint show barring his passage. "I will finish stroke attempt oppose me?" They fell back alarmed. Lenoir darted inner vault, he gained flight steps. Reaching top, he darted cottage, reaching open, suddenly found midst dozen men. The first person upon his glance rested, doubly-dyed traitor betrayed solely serve his ends, entrapping Jack Harkaway--the Englishman, must recognized reader, spite his assumed name, Herbert Murray. Instinctively Lenoir divined his betrayer young Englishman. No sooner conclusion force upon thought personal danger vanished his mind, he possessed one sole idea, one single desire. Revenge! He lost sight peril he ran, cry like roar wounded lion he sprang upon traitor. A brawny, powerful fellow Pierre Lenoir, Herbert Murray puny thing his grasp. "Hands off!" exclaimed Murray, desperation. Lenoir growled, said nothing, he shook much terrier rat. Before police could interfere spy's behalf, Lenoir held one hand arm's length, he prepared deliver fearful blow. The energy despair seized hapless traitor, wrenching free coiner's grasp, he fled. Pierre Lenoir stood staring second. Then he made him. Away went pursuer pursued. The terror-stricken Murray got ground like hare, although coiner fleet foot, he first distanced race. It became desperate race them. Lenoir tore on. He would his betrayer perish. But he got two hundred yards pace began tell upon him. He felt he would give in. "I must go easier, I shall fail altogether." So reasoning, he slackened his pace, dropped slinging trot runners France know _pas gymnastique_. If strength wind average quality, keep prodigious time that. Murray flew on, anxious get away his furious pursuer. He increased his lead. But presently pace told upon likewise. He collected his thoughts his prudence he went, rested. Glancing his shoulder, he saw Lenoir come bounding along, considerable distance rear. "Savage beast!" thought Murray. "He means mischief." Murray meant tiring out. This, however, easily done. The Englishman capital runner, one crack men his school-club. But his _forte_ pace. The Frenchman, contrary, stayer. It looked bad Murray. On went, good mile covered, Murray, glancing back, felt convinced question time. He must tire Frenchman end, he thought. He believed Englishman must always match Frenchman kind athletics. He reckoned without his host, he (Murray) getting blown, Lenoir swung _pas gymnastique_, got his second wind, being, appearance, capable keeping length time. "I shall give up," gasped Murray, when, end second mile, he looked his shoulder again. An unpleasant fact revealed itself. While he faltering, Frenchman rather improving his pace. Yes. The distance lessening. And he could hear Lenoir's menaces quite plainly coiner gained upon him. "I shall directly, I shall beat skull in!" Frenchman said. Murray's craven heart leapt his mouth. Already he felt his cranium cracked brutal fist savage coiner. Fear lent wings. He put spurt. "Oh, I pistol," thought Murray; "what fool I come unarmed job this." He partially flagged again. The distance still decreasing. This he felt beginning end, he thinking nothing turn make best fight he could, he sighted roadside inn--a rural auberge. And he flew renewed energy. Dashing house, he pushed door startled aubergiste gasping best French he could command-- "_Un assassin poursuit. Cachez-moi, ou donnez-moi de quoi défendre!_"[3] [3] "I pursued assassin. Hide me, give something defend with." The landlord took Murray--and unnaturally--for madman. He like society madmen. To give weapon furious maniac question. And landlord nothing handy deadly nature knife fork. Moreover, he would cared place dangerous weapon madman's hands. So he met case humouring fugitive proposal go stairs. Murray wanted second invitation. Up he flew, locked one upper rooms Lenoir hammered door below. "_Où est-il?_"[4] demanded coiner, fiercely. [4] "Where he?" "_Qui?_"[5] [5] "Who?" "_Ne cherchez pas à tricher_," thundered Lenoir. "_Il m'appartient. Où est-il, je vous le demande?_"[6] [6] "Seek deceive me," thundered Lenoir. "He belongs me. Where he, I ask again?" The coiner's manner made aubergiste uneasy, thoughtful his safety. So he pointed stairs. Up went Lenoir, finding room door locked, he flung his whole weight door sent in. This room fugitive entered. But Murray? Gone! Vanished! But where? CHAPTER XCIV. THE COINER AND THE SPY--A REGULAR DUST-UP, AND WHAT CAME OF IT--THE CHASE--AN ODD ESCAPE--HUNTING IN THE HAY--A ROUGH CUSTOMER DONE FOR. When Lenoir puzzled time mysterious disappearance Herbert Murray, he made discovery. The window open, circumstance he then, unaccountable manner imaginable, overlooked. But he got window looked out, signs object his search. He followed sharply Murray could time get off. He looked road eagerly. The thing sight wagon-load hay drawn team horses, whose head plodded waggoner blue cotton blouse, whip hand. "_Hé, la-bas!_" shouted coiner window. The waggoner turned looked eagerly up. "_Qu'avez-vous?_" demanded waggoner. "What is matter?" "Have seen anyone jump window?" shouted Lenoir. The waggoner responded tartly, he fancied his questioner trying chaff him. "I have seen one mad enough that; fact I have seen one madder since I have part country." "_Espèce de voyou!_" cried irritable Lenoir, "_je te ficherais une danse si j'avais le temps pour t'apprendrs ce que c'est que la politesse_. I would dust jacket I time teach politeness." "You are likely time enough that, long live, _espéce de pignouf_." "Idiot!" "_Imbécile!_" This interchange compliments appeared relieve belligerent parties considerably. Lenoir obliged give bad job. Suddenly singular idea shot his head. The hay cart! What Herbert Murray got unseen now, without his presence suspected waggoner? Lenoir reflected moment. Then he darted stairs pursuit waggon. "Hullo, there, driver!" he shouted. The waggoner looked his shoulder recognised Lenoir. So he whipped up. The best pace even stout team horses could put on, big load hay behind say racehorse speed, coiner soon caught up. The waggoner awaited his approach, grasping his whip nervous grip foreboded mischief. On came Lenoir. "I say, friend," he called out, "I think man concealed cart!" "_Va-t-en!_--get out!" retorted waggoner. "I serious. Will oblige pulling looking?" "Not exactly." Lenoir limited stock patience, he soon came end it. He ran leading horse pulled sharply. The waggoner swore lashed up. But Lenoir, turning his attention next shaft horse, pulled waggon standstill. And waggoner, furious this, lashed Lenoir. The whip caught round head shoulders, curling man could get free. Lenoir caught thong, sudden jerk, brought waggoner his seat. Now began pretty little skirmish could wish see. The waggoner fell easy prey furious coiner first. He half-dazed jerked ground. But he soon recovered himself. Then he set punching Lenoir his strength. Then grappled fiercely other. A desperate struggle supremacy ensued. At length Lenoir's superior strength science prevailed, tough waggoner was. The latter lay coiner, whose knee pressed cruelly upon his chest. "Now ask pardon," said Lenoir. "Never!" roared defeated waggoner, stoutly. "I shall kill do not," said Lenoir, threateningly. "Mind do not get finished first," said waggoner significantly. As he spoke, he looking his conqueror's shoulder. Lenoir perceived this, thought _ruse_ get shift his hold. So, contemptuous smile, he raised his clenched fist deal luckless waggoner blow knock every scrap sense his unfortunate cranium. "Take that!" But waggoner could get it, Lenoir received something sent earth hollow groan--felled like bullock beneath butcher's pole-axe. Somebody concealed waggon. That somebody Herbert Murray himself. The English youth heard scuffle, seeing his opportunity, he slid his place concealment joined fight right moment. * * * * The waggoner shook together. "That neatly done, _camarade_," he said. "I time," said Murray; "look him. He wanted police; desperate customer. They now." "He is quiet," said waggoner, curious glance. "He is dead," returned Murray; "he his destiny fulfil yet." "What may be?" "The galleys," reply. The waggoner stared hard young Murray. "I do not like look much beast lying there," he thought himself; "mind do not keep company galleys." An odd fancy cross stranger's mind. Was prophetic? CHAPTER XCV. PLANS FOR OUR FRIENDS' RELEASE--MURRAY'S COUNTER-PLOT--THE LETTER, AND HOW IT WAS INTERCEPTED--HERBERT MURRAY TRIUMPHS--CHIVEY WORKS THE ARTFUL DODGE. "Well," exclaimed unfortunate Mole, "this nice go!" "I am glad think nice," said young Jack, bitterly. As spoke, led streets Marseilles, handcuffed two abreast, brace gendarmes couple. The people flocked stare "notorious gang forgers, which"--so rang report--"had captured police, making desperate resistance." The first impulse Jack Harkaway naturally resist his captors. But he speedily shown uselessness course. When brought judge examination, protested innocence, told simple truth. But avail them. Herbert Murray prepared way statements regarded falsehoods. By means, Jack protested his name Harkaway, went clearly him, inasmuch corroborated Murray said. So remanded, one all, sent back cells. Mr. Mole's indignation could subdued. "These people worse savages!" he exclaimed; "but we will let know. They shall make us ample reparation indignity." He talked threateningly British ambassador, made kinds threats. But he poohpoohed authorities. Harry Girdwood one party kept his coolness. He put forth his request much earnestness, allowed see English consul, his request granted once. He drew letter entrusted gaoler, promised forwarded. Now became known Herbert Murray, he saw he still task ordinary difficulty him--that sufficient alone his hated enemies arrested. The greater difficulty far keep he secured them. In crisis he consulted his worthless servant confederate, Chivey. "Our next job," said Chivey, doubtfully, "is get gaoler, stop letter he received reaching destination." "How would set work?" demanded his master. "You inside," said Chivey, "and I will lay wait messenger letter outside case fail." "Good." "You buy gaoler," said tiger. "I will." "Do so. Your task easier two. Ten francs ought square him." "It ought," said Murray; "but I question will." * * * * Murray doomed sad disappointment his operations, he would, he could "get at" man charged delivering Harkaways' letters. But he contrived ascertain man was, give description tiger. Chivey saw man come prison, he thought various plans getting hold letter he knew he must carrying. His first idea go address straight upon subject; would do. The messenger would probability take alarm. He next idea following messenger, giving crack head, rifling his pockets. This idea he abandoned even sooner first, sundry wholesome reasons. Firstly, man's road lead sufficiently quiet places attempt. Secondly, man tough-looking customer, awkward fellow tackle. And thirdly--but second reason sufficed send Chivey's mind away ideas violence. No; deeds daring Chivey's line. He notion, however, go fast he could British consul's, ready messenger he came. His plans matured this; chance seemed much favour precious pair youthful scamps--for time being, rate. * * * * Chivey timed his arrival consul's residence, minutes advance prison messenger. The servant admitted Englishman, told Chivey his master particularly engaged then, would visible considerable time. "Be good ask I see master," said Chivey, air lofty condescension. "I must disturb now," said servant. "He vexed do not," returned Chivey, "when he knows business." The servant impressed threat, went obey insidious tiger, course livery. Barely consul's servant disappeared, messenger prison entered. Chivey recognised instantly. "_Une lettre pour Monsieur le Consul_," said messenger. Chivey held his hand, man, taking granted Chivey belonged consular establishment, gave him. "_Il une réponse_--there answer," said messenger. "It forwarded," returned Chivey, cool presence mind. "I ought take me," said messenger. "I cannot disturb his excellency now," replied tiger; "those master's express orders, I cannot presume disobey. He send answer immediately ready." The man paused. "The consul expecting letter," said Chivey, moving towards door, "and he told particularly he would send answer on." "_Puisqu'il est ainsi_," said man, dubiously. "Since must so, I suppose I better leave letter." "Of course had," returned Chivey, closing door. "I daresay get answer within hour." At moment servant returned message consul effect half hour he could seen, applicant would call again. "Very good," said Chivey, patronising manner, "you may tell master I look back later on." "Very well, sir." Chivey walked out, chuckling inwardly success his mission. "What could easier?" said Cockney scamp himself; "shelling peas fool it." But he could get fairly threshold, servant stopped question startled little, well-nigh made lose his presence mind. "The man called now, sir, he left letter." "Eh? Oh, yes!" "For you, sir?" "Yes," added Chivey coolest effrontery. "My servant knew I come here; thinking detained time his excellency consul, I left word hotel I coming, he followed letter." "Oh, I see, sir," returned servant, obsequiously, "quite so, sir, beg pardon, sir." "Not all, good man, all," returned Chivey, superciliously; "you civil, well-spoken young man--here trifle you." He passed servant large silver coin, walked on. The servant bowed examined coin, process bobbing his head. "Five francs," said consul's servant, himself; "he is real swell, anyone see." One word more. The five-franc piece slight degree biassed servant's opinion visitor, one Pierre Lenoir's admirable manufacture. * * * * "Let us look letter, Chivey," said Herbert Murray, soon his servant got back. But Chivey seemed hesitate. "Come, come," said Murray, "we shall quarrel terms." "We oughnt't to," returned tiger, "for it is worth Jew's eye." Murray tore letter open read eagerly. As throws additional light upon actual state affairs Harkaway party, possibly may well give letter young Jack consul verbatim. It dated prison. "SIR,--I wish solicit immediate assistance getting released uncomfortable premises, where, company party friends fellow-travellers, I singular accident carried police. From scraps information I gained here, I believe I correct asserting fallen trap, cunningly prepared us unscrupulous fellow-countryman ours, cogent reasons wishing us way, accordingly caused friends arrested coiners. The person question named Herbert Murray, I unable say _alias_ he present known part world. I mention may able keep eye upon individual pending release bail, I presume bail French institution. My signature serve reference me, may readily identified father's bankers here, Messrs. B. Fould & Co. "Your obedient servant, "JACK HARKAWAY." Herbert Murray pursed his brows he read on. "What think that?" demanded Chivey. "Queer!" "Precious queer." "The one lesson learnt it, Chivey," said his master, "is stop correspondence prisoners consul." "And push forward trial much possible." "Yes, get together many reliable witnesses can----" "Buy pound apiece," concluded Chivey. "Right," said Herbert Murray, mischievous grin; "forewarned, forearmed; hold we will keep them----" "Please pigs," concluded Chivey fervently. CHAPTER XCVI. OUR FRIENDS IN DURANCE VILE--A STROKE FOR LIBERTY--THE PRISONERS' PLOT--MOLE IS PRESCRIBED FOR--A FRIEND IN NEED--HOPES AND MISGIVINGS--"OLD WET BLANKET." "It is odd." "Very." "And scarcely polite," suggested Mr. Mole. "Well, scarcely." "That makes fourth letter I written him, he does not even condescend notice them." "Very odd." "Very." But sufferers seeming neglect consul expressing freely matter, old Sobersides, Jack called his comrade, Harry Girdwood, remained silent meditative. Jack great faith his thoughtful chum. "A penny thoughts, Harry," said he. "I will give nix," returned Harry Girdwood, gaily. "Out it." "I wondering whether, blaming poor consul, he ever received letters." "What, four?" "Yes." "Of course." "I do not see it." "But, dear fellow, consider. One may miscarried--or two--but hang it! four cannot gone wrong." "Of course not," said Mole, air man puts final stop arguments. "There I beg leave differ all." "Why?" "The letters reached consul, perhaps; may intercepted." "By whom?" Jack's natural question. "Cannot say positively; possibly Murray." "Is likely?" "Is not?" "I do not see, unless he bought messenger." "And likely that?" said Harry. "And bought one messenger, good all, single letter, every scrap paper may send prison, may depend upon it." This simple reasoning struck his hearers. "Upon life!" exclaimed Jack, "I believe Harry's right. We must tackle governor." "So I think." "And I too," added Harry Girdwood; "but how?" "I will write letter." "Yes; send gaoler," said Harry. "Yes." "The gaoler carried letters? Why, Jack, Jack, thoughtless, rattlebrained chap are. What earth use move that?" Jack's countenance fell this. "You are right, Harry. I go jumping like bull gate usual. What would do?" Harry's answer brief sententious. "Think." "Do so, mate," returned Jack, hopefully again; "do so." "I will." He pressed his lips knit his brows burlesque, melodramatic air, strode down, his forefinger his forehead. He stopped suddenly stamped twice, haughty earl might transpontine tragedy resolving upon his crowning villany, exclaimed voice suggestive fiend-like triumph-- "I it." "Hold tight, then." "One us must sham ill get doctor here. Once he is here, shall right." "Hurrah!" cried Jack Harkaway; "that is notion. We shall yet defeat schemes incarnate fiend, Murray." "That capital idea," said Mr. Mole. "You suggested quite new idea." "Now stop; next thing us think sham invalid," said Jack. "I would suggest Tinker," said Harry. "Or Bogey," observed Mr. Mole. "Why?" "Because would easy tell whether looked delicate health not." "There is something that," said Jack, "but there is say it." "What?" "They might able keep game well one ourselves, I think----" Here Jack paused, whilst Harry he exchanged meaning wink unobserved old gentleman. "I think ought Mr. Mole," continued hero. "Why?" "Why, sir; ask why? You lovely shammer." "Come, I say," began Mr. Mole, scarcely relishing it. "He is quite right, sir," said Harry Girdwood, "you inimitable shammer." "I?" "You pitch strong, Mr. Mole," said Jack. "And natural," added Harry Girdwood. "Life-like," said two together, mingled tones rapt admiration. Mr. Mole human. Humanity frail, ever open voice flattery. What could Mole yield? Nothing. He gave in, shammed ill indeed. Well, result gaoler made his report, doctor came. "_De quoi se plaint-il?_" demanded doctor, he entered cell. "What he say?" asked Mole; "I am deaf adder." "The doctor asks complain of?" said Jack, loud voice. "Oh, thing he likes," returned Mole, impatiently. They point bursting laughing this, doctor startled considerably saying broken (but understandable) English-- "What he say--any thing I like? _Singulier!_" "Ahem!" Harry Girdwood gave word; glance intelligence went round. They, use Jack's expression, pulled together, looked serious. "It headache," said Jack. "Violent headache, he says." "Yes," said Mole. "Show tongue." Mole thrust out, doctor felt his pulse. "Very bad; fever." "What?" ejaculated Mole, aghast. "You fever." "What sort?" The surgeon looked puzzled. "Typhus scarlet, I say," suggested Jack. "What that?" demanded French doctor, curiously. "_Je ne suis pas très fort_--I strong English." "Then, sir," said Jack, "pray accept compliments upon proficiency; really remarkable." "You good say that," returned surgeon; "_mais_--now _malade_--what _malade_ English?" "Patient." "Patient! Well, I hope he justify ze designation. What feel?" he added Mr. Mole. "Rush blood head," said Mole, thinking quite safe symptom announce. "Yes, yes--_sans doute_--no doubt," said doctor, looking wise owl. "We make better quick--a little _sinapisme_." "That is call mustard plaister, is not it?" said Harry. "_Sinapisme_--mustard who?" demanded French doctor Jack. "Plaister." "_Merci._" "I am going mustard plaister on," said Mole. "_Comment!_" exclaimed doctor; "_il n'en veut pas!_ he not! _Morbleu!_ Ze prisonniers ze docteur ordonnances." "Will he?" "Yes. You quite right, doctor," said Jack, French. "Where he plaister?" "On his legs, back his ankles," replied doctor; "it draw blood his head." "Very good, sir." Jack translated, patient singularly enough grew reassured immediately. "It will not hurt much back legs, Mr. Mole," said Harry. They enjoyed quiet grin this. The prison doctor sent gaoler writing materials purpose writing prescription. Then chance. "Doctor," said Jack, "I want see governor." "Why asked, then, gaoler?" "I prefer method." "Why?" "Because I do not know whether gaoler safe." "I do not understand you," said doctor. "I written four letters British consul," returned Jack, "and answer come." "Well?" "Well, sir, I afraid he never received letters." "Why?" "Because name well known him, he would replied. I referred chief banker town, readily identify signature. I wish communicate father, and, word, show authorities utterly ridiculous preposterous charge us spite appearances." Jack's earnestness caught his attention. "They would never dare keep letters back." "Money tempted them, I feel assured." "Whose money?" "The money spy--a fellow-countryman ours, interest keeping way." "His name?" "His real name Herbert Murray, his assumed name Markby." "Markby; I know name. Of course; he principal witness you. You say his assumed name?" "Yes." "Can prove it?" "Easily; I get means establishing defence. It effect this, I addressed consul, he reply, that, monstrous absurd charge is, unable disprove it, simply tied hand foot." "This strange." The doctor, he spoke, shot dubious glance, escape Jack. "I tell you, sir, father rich influential. Moreover, he exceedingly liberal money matters me. I slightest need add income means whatever, much less dishonest courses." "What proof I offer governor?" "Plenty," returned Jack, eagerly. "Here father's address England; let communicated immediately. This Markby unscrupulous rascal. He forged name several cheques, robbed me. He fears detection, built cunning plot, using coiner, Lenoir, his cat's paw, caged upon ridiculous charge, he get another part world." This convinced prison surgeon completely. "I see governor once," said he; "meanwhile, see obstinate old friend attends instructions, he soon well." "Excuse me, doctor," said Jack, "but honest truth he ill all." "Not ill!" "No. We doubted gaoler's honesty, and, fearing he bought enemy, adopted ruse." "To see me?" "Yes." "Ha, ha! I see now; ingenious part. Well, well, young friend, I see governor once, shall long trouble." "You earn eternal gratitude, fellow-prisoners, well much substantial acknowledgment father." "_Bien, bien_," said surgeon smiling. "_Au revoir!_" And bowing pleasantly prisoners generally, doctor left cell. * * * * "There," said Jack. "You may look upon settled, comfort yourselves." "He gone governor?" asked Mole. "Yes." "Hurrah!" "I hope go right now," said Harry Girdwood, scarcely cheerful his companions. "You wretched old wet blanket!" exclaimed Jack, gaily, "of course will." "Of course," added Mole. "You may consider good outside prison already." "I do, one," said Mole, quite hilarious prospect. "Humph!" said Harry. CHAPTER XCVII. THE DOCTOR AND THE GOVERNOR--HOW THE PLOT WORKS IN FAVOUR OF JACK'S ENEMIES--UNLUCKY PRISONERS! "_Sapristi!_" Thus spake governor prison. The occasion within minutes doctor's entrance his private cabinet, medico gone immediately quitting English-prisoners. "_Sapristi!_" "Well, say easily verified," said doctor, rather tartly. The fact he somewhat nettled doubting expression governor met his account his interview Jack Harkaway his fellow prisoners. "My dear Doctor Berteaux," returned governor, irritating smile, "this youth notorious young scoundrel. Just see clever he must be, too; he actually imposed upon astute Doctor Berteaux, vast experience amongst criminals." "But, sir----" "I tell you, doctor, I know young scoundrel A Z. His real name Herbert Murray." "Why, he said real name agent Markby," exclaimed doctor. "The deuce he did. Egad! doctor, that is beautiful." And governor chuckled rarely idea. The doctor began look little uncomfortable. "Do mean say----" "That egregiously humbugged? Yes, that is exactly I mean. Why, doctor, doctor, time life consider." "But----" "Come, come, get rid silly fancy, old friend." "At least," insisted doctor, "do favour communicate consul." "Indeed, I shall nothing kind. You see British consul like, rare laugh he will enjoy expense he sees duped young scoundrel." "Ahem!" * * * * Well, doctor communicate consul this, Jack Harkaway waited his companions, Mole "wet blanket," Harry Girdwood, two faithful darkeys, waited vain. Waited grew heart-sick hope deferred. CHAPTER XCVIII. JOE DEERING AT HOME AGAIN--ON THE LOOKOUT--NEWS AT LAST--JOVIAL CAPTAIN ROBINSON IN DANGER. We must cross Channel England again. But long. One character drama real life appeared upon scene time. We allude skipper "Albatross," Joe Deering. Captain Deering finished his course returned his native land. He anxious get home, he purpose view. He wished rout two men he owed deep grudge, he fully determined pay off. One Mr. Murray, treacherous owner ill-fated "Albatross," Captain Deering, borne mind, ignorant wretched man's well-merited fate. The traitor friend his, accomplice elder Murray--jovial Captain Robinson. Joe Deering earnest, he pursued his inquiries utmost diligence. The jovial captain heard anywhere first. But Joe Deering, baffled here, like skilled mariner he was, set another tack. He made his inquiries Mr. Murray alone. "Where one thief is," said Joe, himself, "the murdering scoundrel sure far off." For time his search proved unavailing again; he presently rewarded his perseverance first gleam good luck. He learnt late address Murray senior. "This step right direction," said Joe Deering, chuckle. So renewed hope he went house. "Mr. Murray are not home many months, sir," said housekeeper, reply Deering's inquiry, "and I have not news since goodness knows when." "You do not mean that?" said Deering, aghast. "Indeed, I do, I hope you are going misbelieve like Captain Robinson, calls every----" "What?" ejaculated Deering. "Avast there. Captain Robinson, say?" "Yes." "Do know him?" "I cannot well knowing him, seeing he is twice day, I know he never wished poor master good." "What makes think that?" asked Joe Deering. "Master used always try avoid seeing him, poor old gentleman," replied housekeeper. "Why call 'poor old gentleman?'" "Because I know he suffered dreadfully, I think he worried Robinson something dreadful." "How dreadful?" Joe Deering's curiosity excited housekeeper's manner, he pressed her information. "That Captain Robinson worrited skeleton, sir," she answered; "he always nag, nag, nagging night day. At last poor master bolted, sir." "Bolted!" "Ran away." "Where to?" "I do not know; he bolted here, Captain Robinson." "But Mr. Murray surely fear Captain Robinson?" "Indeed, he was. Captain Robinson knew something poor master ought not known, said, he always trying force Mr. Murray give money." "The deuce he was!" said Captain Deering. "This throws new light scoundrel his cursed good-natured-looking figure-head." "A deceitful beast!" said housekeeper, warmly. "You would thought he could not hurt worm look him, yet I believe he is drove poor Mr. Murray make away himself." "You do not think that?" "What else I think? He has not seen heard months months. But I was not heavy heart that, sir, I could laugh joy see beast Captain Robinson's disappointment every time he comes." "So he comes often?" said Joe Deering, eagerly. "Every day; sometimes twice day," reply. Deering thought information quietly. "Would like serve out?" he asked presently. "Who?" "Captain Robinson," responded Deering. "That I should, indeed," said housekeeper, eagerly; "only show it." "I will." Joe Deering did. He made known woman, convinced her he ample reason wishing repay grudge. And plotted together wreak well-merited vengeance upon falsely jovial Captain Robinson. The nature vengeance learn patience wait till next chapter. CHAPTER XCIX. HOW CAPTAIN ROBINSON CAME TO APPLY HIS LEECH AGAIN--WHAT CAME OF IT--THE SEA GIVES UP ITS DEAD--A FEARSOME SIGHT--THE TRAITOR'S TERROR--JOE DEERING WIPES OFF AN OLD SCORE. Captain Robinson jovial ever. His honest-looking, ruddy face beaming smiles, he appeared hearty honest, upright plain-sailing fellow world. Captain Robinson like sailors one respect; he remarkably superstitious. Instinctive presage good luck to-day put rare spirits, he made his customary call. "I feel I going land to-day," muttered jovial captain himself. And his face actually beaming smiles, his hand rested knocker. "Oh, good, morning, Mrs. Wilmot," he said, heartily; "how bright morning, Mrs. Wilmot?" "Better, thank you, Captain Robinson," returned housekeeper, giving odd glance. "That is hearty. Why, looking yourself." "Better health, better spirits," said housekeeper, insidiously. The captain pricked his ears this. "Any better news chance, Mrs. Wilmot?" said he. "Ah, indeed," said she. "About master?" asked he. "That is it," said she. "You do not mean say he is coming home again?" "I do not mean say he is coming," said housekeeper, wondrous significance. "Why, whatever driving at?" he said. "I am a-driving nothing, Captain Robinson--leastways, I aware of. All I know is, Mr. Murray are not likely coming home, he are not position come home, seeing as----" She paused. "What?" "Guess what." "Hang all, I cannot." "You must." She laughed outright, clapped her hands regular kitten-like joy. "What earth mean, Mrs. Wilmot? I hate palavering beating bush. If he is coming home, say so; he are not coming home, tell I see him, he is hiding." "Why, he cannot coming home when----" Here she stopped short aggravating manner world. The jovial captain grew black threatening. He going burst noisy fit abusive language, she stopped short remark quite startled him. "There, there, impatient man are, surely, Captain Robinson. Go stairs see he are not coming home." The captain could infer one thing her words. Murray back. Yes, he coming home, he already come. This explained housekeeper's joyous spirits, seemed bubble her. "She is nice old gal," said Robinson himself, he mounted stairs, "and I will stand her trifle I applied leech her master again. Ha, ha, ha!" The jovial captain laughed quaint conceit. He rarely enjoyed prospect gloating miserable Murray writhing moral pressure. "I will make bleed handsome keeping away long," thought jovial mariner. "I wonder he will enjoy leech long while?" His hand rested upon handle door. What startler would Mr. Murray. "I will knock," thought jovial Captain Robinson; "he will think it is Mother Wilmot again. Such larks!" He knocked. "Come in." How changed voice sounded. "He is caught cold," thought practical joker. He opened door. Closed carefully behind guard intrusion. Then he turn faced--Joe Deering! * * * * Jovial Captain Robinson stood aghast. The sight his old friend literally petrified him. Deering stood facing jovial scoundrel, his hands leaning table. Not muscle his face moved. A cold, settled expression his eyes. So fixed, steady, might set head dead man. The jovial Robinson tongue-tied time. * * * * "Joe!" This monosyllable he faltered long while, big effort. But Joe Deering said never word reply, he move muscle. "Joe." Deering stared fixed, glassy eyes, Jovial Captain Robinson hideous idea flash across him. Was really living man there? He fastened fixed, fascinating look upon figure friend he villainously betrayed, retreating step, groped behind him, handle door. At last he got hold it, turned it. "Stop!" Deering spoken, jerk jovial Captain Robinson turned round. "Joe!" he gasped, again, "did speak?" Now Joe Deering saw traitor's pallid cheeks, frightened look, passing his mind. So he pains destroy illusion. "I did. Your ears deceive you." "I thought not," faltered Captain Robinson, plucking faint degree, however. "You marvel see ocean give dead," began Joe Deering, hollow voice. Jovial Captain Robinson sank door support, delicate green tint spread his face. We said he superstitious man. This huge lump humanity--nay, rather inhumanity--was worse schoolgirl point courage. The word ghost frightened him, he saw print. He sure Joe Deering dead. Certain he Joe Deering decoyed floating coffin, sent watery grave himself. Here betrayed man's ghost come reproach his crime. The strong man turned heart-sick, like faint. Joe Deering looked fear-stricken traitor silence. He enjoyed his terror keenly indeed. No feeling pity abject terror wretched man crossed him. For his thoughts went back fearful days nights passed board doomed "Albatross." Jovial Captain Robinson pitiless before, sufferings gone terrible time hardened Joe Deering's kind heart. A genial, generous soft-hearted fellow rule, he could pardon infamous wretch lured trap, even professing affectionate friendship him. No! This Joe Deering's chance--his long looked-for opportunity, weak emotion spoil revenge he waited patiently. * * * * Jovial Captain Robinson essayed speak. In faint, faltering voice, he managed pronounce Joe Deering's name. "Well, murderer!" returned Joe Deering; "what want?" "I want shake hands me, Joe," responded other, almost inaudibly. "Assassin!" "I--I--I do not mean harm," gasped jovial Captain Robinson. "Liar!" thundered Joe Deering; "you dare make statement, hovering do, life death!" "No, no, no, no!" shrieked jovial captain; "not that, Joe, that." "Yes, I say; long world." "You sent tell that, Joe," said Robinson, his voice dying away spite desperate effort make audible. "I am." "Ugh!" And half groan, half grunt, he sank upon ground prostrate. Before his senses fairly fled, Joe Deering strode him, delivered heavy kick behind. This brought round wonderful way. He knew material foot given kick, conviction marvellous relief him. He scrambled up. As he got his feet, Joe Deering fixed throat, shook him. "You plotted accomplish murder," he said, "but turn's come, Robinson, I mean punish you." Jovial Captain Robinson coward, arrant cur, yet he infinitely preferred tackle flesh blood, battling ghost. He turned upon his assailant. But Deering denied. Before jovial captain could thing help himself, Joe Deering hammered his face jelly. Half dazed, stunned, blinded, Robinson fought out, struggling fiercely, he shook free. And he fled like beaten cur house. Joe Deering attempt follow him. "There," he said, calmly enough, considering gone before, "that is done. Thank goodness it is mind. Mr. Murray must next attention." He little thought wretched shipowner already paid penalty his crimes. * * * * Jovial Captain Robinson never man again. Whether physical mental punishment he had, cannot possibly determine, certain something broke day, he lingered miserable life two years more, died abject want. CHAPTER C. A DOSE OF PALM OIL. Having settled hash jovial Captain Robinson, proceed pleasant task measuring justice others. Messieurs Murray Chivey persons mean. Those gentlemen, taken excellent precautions cut young Jack Harkaway's communications outer world, fancied tolerably safe. Yet every Murray's nerves shaken he thought vindictive Lenoir. What become dangerous individual? The police gone spot Murray told he left coiner senseless, certainly found traces severe struggle, Lenoir disappeared. The peasant also done his duty French citizen reporting affair first gendarme he met his road. But though Marseilles thoroughly searched, trace man could found, either town surrounding rural districts. "There is one consolation, guv'nor," observed Chivey, "he will not dare show his ugly mug Marseilles more, you are safe enough here." "He is desperate enough thing." "It is galleys life he is collared, he knows well enough." "Galleys!--ugh!" And Herbert Murray gave convulsive shudder, he sympathetically joined Chivey. "Are not 'orrid see poor devils chained oars, hoverseer walkin' his whip, a-lashin'  them?" said Chivey. "It Is, indeed." Murray paused shuddered, moment, he continued-- "But would jolly, though, see Harkaway his friends it." "Crikey! would not I jest like see old beast Mole pulling away his stumps. D'ye think they will get it?" asked Chivey. "Yes, unless manage communicate friends consul." "Then I better stroll see old pal gaoler stopped letters." "Yes, go means, do not call them, he is likely enough give to----" Murray hesitated, Chivey instantly supplied word. "The rightful owners, mean, guv'nor." "Cut away!" sharply exclaimed Murray, annoyed liberties taken his quondam servant. Chivey strolled towards prison, time meet gaoler coming out. "Mornin', mossoo," he said, familiar nod, "rather warm, are not it? What d'ye say bottle wine jest wash dust yer throat?" The Frenchman comprehend fourth part speech, he understood he partake bottle wine, signified his willingness. "Vid moosh plaisir, m'sieu." And he led way cabaret sold his favourite wine. "Now got letters me?" said Chivey, comfortably seated table, remote customers, engaged noisy game dominoes. "No understand," said man, shaking his head. "Any letters--billy duxes?" The man made gesture indicate he understand. "Thick-headed old idiot," muttered Chivey; calling pantomime aid his lack French, he produced first letter Jack written consul. "Letter, like this." The gaoler's eyes twinkled; he nodded half drew breast-pocket his uniform document Chivey anxious get hold of. "Hand over, old pal," he said, holding his hand. The gaoler smiled he concealed letter. Then he turn held his hand, made signs he required something dropped it. "Old cormorant wants palm oil," muttered Chivey, reluctantly he drew his pocket one gold pieces Herbert Murray given purpose bribing gaoler. But Frenchman shook his head. "Two; I cannot part letter two," he said, much better English he hitherto spoken. "Well, I am blest! Why could not speak like before? We would come business much sooner." "I thought Monsieur would like exhibit his extensive knowledge French tongue, letter." "And here is coin. I buy many get figure." "You shall certainly first chance." Chivey helped another glass, asked-- "When trial be?" "The judge, unfortunately, taken ill, prisoners wait three weeks opportunity proving innocence." "That is unfortunate. What think they will get?" "If found guilty, twenty years galleys." "What, old wooden legs all?" "The gentleman lost his limbs probably sent employment." "What pity. Well, good-bye, old cock; keep weather-eye open." "_Au revoir, monsieur._" Cocking his hat much one side, Chivey stalked place. CHAPTER CI. HOW THE PURLOINED LETTER WAS LOST--AND WHO FOUND IT. "That 'ere frog-eating swine gets two quid bonin' letter, I think I am entitled one. Cannot let coin go old Frenchy's pocket." Thus Chivey muttered he neared place he Herbert Murray staying. Chivey evidently intended putting screw Herbert. "Look here, guv'nor," said he, he entered room; "I are not much reading cove, I see book called Jessop's fables." "Æsop's fables, I presume mean, Chivey?" "It is same. But there is yarn monkey made cat pull chestnuts fire; I am jiggered I am going play cat." "I aware anyone wishes so," responded Murray, his blandest manner. "Well, a-trying on, rate." "How so?" "Why, supposing it is found stopping letters?" "Which letters, Chivey?" "The one I have got pocket, and----" "Oh, you have got one, then. Hand over, please, Chivey." "Not fast, guv'nor. You jest listen I have got say first?" "I attention." "Well, supposing game found out, think would get trouble?" "Why, would, undoubtedly; friend French gaoler." "And do not think it is worth come handsome, considering risk I run." "It strike light; I think would good plan get rid stolen letter soon possible; thing found out, gaoler says he gave letters, likely his word--the word man acknowledges thief--will taken yours, unless documents found possession." "That is well." "Then it is well, hand letter." And Murray held his hand. Chivey, reluctantly, passed letter, muttering he so-- "Well, I am blest I do not think would whistle blackbird nest stole eggs." Herbert Murray took notice speech; he deeply engrossed letter he found read follows-- "To Her Britannic Majesty's Consul Marseilles: "SIR,--I already addressed several letters subject incarceration friends prison Marseilles, charge counterfeit coining. I also explained led, artful devices person calling Markby, actually coiner's house police entered it, and, therefore, appearances certainly us. To letters made reply, I think certainly hard, quite right, I imagine duty British consul includes looking interests British subjects town district he stationed at. "Now, sir, former letters I requested communicate bankers town, also father, whose address I give below, placed money hands use. If so, see statements former letters correct; not, number British subjects probably condemned heavily sentenced, entirely neglect. "Therefore, I beg communicate identify friends, meantime use influence postpone trial till communication effected. "Your obedient servant, "J. HARKAWAY, JUNR." "My eye!" said Chivey, Murray read letter aloud, "are not he getting his back up?" "No matter. They safe enough, get out, I will forgive them." "But will not forgive you." "Perhaps not; ring bell, Chivey. We will wine this, hand cigar box." The ex-groom gave tug bell-rope ordered wine. Then he took cigar-box and, giving vigorous shake, ejaculated-- "There are not blessed smoke it, guv'nor." "Well, I will put hat stroll shop Monsieur Cretineau-Joly order fresh stock. I must minutes' exercise gets dark; shall not ten minutes." Herbert left apartment, Chivey muttered-- "He is afraid meeting Lenoir he goes dark." And Chivey quite right. Herbert Murray walked briskly street till he reached tobacconist's, he paused moment, look numerous varieties nicotian herb displayed window, along pipes cigar tubes every shape pattern. As he looked, several others looked, one lookers, removing his pipe, unfortunate allow tobacco ash blow Murray's face. "Curse you, awkward Frenchman," growled Murray, politely apologised mishap. Herbert coughed, sneezed, drew his handkerchief wipe his face; neither he anyone else noticed time he drew young Jack Harkaway's letter, fluttered slowly pavement, lay address downwards. Murray bought his box cigars, returned hotel he resided, still letter lay unheeded beneath tobacco shop window, till darkness settled town Marseilles except street lamps shop lights pierced gloom. Then came shop old man, apparently soldier, he dragged one leg stiffly, his left arm sling. But although his hair white, his carriage upright martial. He looked door, entered, purchased tobacco, he stood outside filled his pipe. "I might taken light inside," he muttered, operation finished, seeing scrap paper pavement, he picked up, use pipe-light. But writing outside caught his eye. "A letter British consul!" old man ejaculated. "It may worth franc two, I restore his excellency." So he thrust his pocket, obtained light, hobbled away direction consulate. But presently he paused retired spot, single lamp illumined surrounding houses. "I wonder letter about," he said; "I make better bargain, perhaps, I know contents." And without ado, man pulled letter, read carefully. Although written English, old French soldier seemed understand thoroughly. "That cursed villain's name again," he hissed, his teeth, he read lines. "But I will pay yet." Then he continued perusal, steadily, till he came end. "It looks like truth," he said, he returned his pocket. "I restore consul. Ha, ha! sport indeed I, Pierre Lenoir, proscribed criminal, defeat schemes villain." With subdued chuckle coiner departed his way, revelling delight thought he would yet avenged his perfidious friend. He reached consul's residence, knocked, admitted servant formerly opened door Chivey. "Is his Excellency Consul home?" "Yes, much engaged," replied flunkey. "I particularly wish see him, I found letter street, may something importance." "Right, good feller; 'ere's franc you." And door closed Lenoir, hastened away. * * * * Two hours later governor gaol consul engaged important conversation. But plans must, present, remain secret, Jack his imprisoned friends know last letter produced better effect first. CHAPTER CII. A SORROWFUL HOUSEHOLD--NEWS AT LAST. Change scene England, particular part island old Jack his friends living. Though surrounded every luxury money could procure, happy. "No news yet!" first question Mrs. Harkaway would ask her husband morning, he shake head, would respond-- "None yet, dear; despond." But fond mother vainly endeavoured hope hope. Little Emily, too, went listless, melancholy manner, wondering Jack write, Paquita, too, quite despondent hearing thing Harry Girdwood. Dick Harvey he could cheer everybody, hard task, he working his convictions, youngsters got trouble unable extricate themselves. Letters written young Jack Marseilles, never reached him, fallen hands Herbert Murray, applied post office, name Harkaway, them. Paquita little Emily, though still firm friends, other's society much formerly, preferred endure sorrows solitude. Paquita, particular, fond sequestered nook grounds, where, half hidden shrubs, she could command view long straight road leading nearest railway station. She notion she would first one see absentees, chosen place observation, she would sit hours watching trying hope. Harvey found her retreat, employed photographer took Emily's portrait, give good likeness southern beauty. Paquita knew nothing this, absorbed she her meditations, till days afterwards Uncle Dick, she learnt call him, gave her copies it. She thanked him, and, hurrying her room, enclosed one envelope, she addressed Harry. There letter it, underneath portrait she wrote-- "_With Paquita's dearest love. As she waits one comes not._" This she posted herself, registering extra safety. * * * * Still came tidings, day day passed, till one morning postman brought large official-looking letter, addressed strange handwriting, bearing foreign post-marks. Despite his hardihood, Harkaway's hand trembled he took up, and, eager he news, seconds he could nerve break seal. His wife sat watching breathless expectation, feeling convinced length news. "Are safe?" she asked, she followed her husband's eye conclusion lengthy epistle. "They _are_ safe, _present_." "Thank Heaven!" she exclaimed, giving way woman's great relief--tears. "But _where_ they?" she continued minute afterwards. "At Marseilles, time, British consul tells me, likely till go release them." "Release them! What mean? Do not keep back anything me, dear husband." "Well, must know worst, prison, charge coining." "What infamous charge make them?" exclaimed couple indignant feminine voices, belonging little Emily Paquita, come room. "Husband, do not believe boy guilty crime?" "No; but----" "But what?" "Appearances much them, consul says. The great thing establish identity, boy supposed assumed name he bears." At moment Harvey appeared, news instantly imparted him. "It serious affair, certain must go once. But really ridiculous fancy old Mole black rascals accused coining." "It ridiculous, condemned sent galleys, pa," said little Emily. "True, little girl, therefore see starting once. You see packing things, I run town get passports lot us." "Passports required travelling," said Emily. "Certainly travelling; establish identity better passports signed British Secretary State foreign affairs?" There answering question; Dick started London, rest busied preparations continental trip. Within forty-eight hours crossing Channel; six hours later entered Paris, took brief rest, continued journey towards Marseilles. For starting Harkaway received telegram consul Marseilles-- "Come soon possibly can, may late." Need said that, message, lost time speeding destination? CHAPTER CIII. MONSIEUR HOCQUART CLERMONT DELAMARRE--THE COINER AT HOME. But consul governor gaol time? When consul first called upon governor gaol, official tried laugh matter. "Surely," said governor, "you do not believe tale young fellows tell?" "I half inclined so, fact writer appears written several letters miscarried. But why, may I ask, I informed countrymen arrested?" "Well, dear sir, story seemed absurd, I think worth trouble you." "But asked see me." "True." "And I fear forward request, I shall obliged mention name, ambassador Paris." "For Heaven's sake not! If thing known minister justice, I lose situation once." "Then I silent matter, must render every assistance finding truth prisoners." "Willingly. What I do?" "I like see youth calls Harkaway; first all, gaoler usually charge prisoners?" "Gone his home, monsieur. The ordinary officials are, doubtless aware, replaced military guard, sunset sunrise." "Good, oblige bringing here." So young Jack brought presence consul, closely questioned he Marseilles. He told truth, and, spite severe cross-examination governor consul, stuck his tale. "Humph!" said consul. "You consistent, events. Well, present, may return cell, do not tell even friends seen British consul." "I will not mention it, sir." And Jack returned his cell, escorted governor himself, consul wish anyone know interview. But governor returned, consul said-- "Now, Monsieur Hocquart Delamarre, think affair?" The governor reply, quietly glided behind screen, probably concealed interview, man middle age height, nothing striking his appearance. He might passed clerk, second-rate shopkeeper, superior artisan; anyone passing street would taken notice whatever everyday kind man. Yet, all, close observer would noticed something peculiar him. His eyes! One moment seemed pierce inmost recesses soul, yet tried, them, find clue owner's thoughts, utterly defeated, became misty expressionless. "What I think affair, monsieur?" "Yes." "Well, early case, difficult pronounce decided opinion," said Delamarre. "That true, Monsieur Delamarre," said consul. "But excellency sought professional assistance case, I feel reputation stake, shall exert utmost." "Monsieur Delamarre one cleverest gentlemen line business," said governor. The middle-aged gentleman bowed. "You kind enough say so, sir." "You made good selection, Monsieur le Consul. In detective police Monsieur Delamarre equals." Again detective bowed, addressing consul, said-- "When shall I next honour waiting again, monsieur?" "As soon learned thing think sufficient importance tell me." "At consulate, course?" "Will safe seen there?" "Monsieur, I stake professional reputation that, I call you, shall recognise till I choose reveal myself. There extremely artful person mixed affair, I shall prove still artful them; take word Hocquart Clermont Delamarre." With another bow French detective made his exit. He proceeded first place his temporary residence, he made considerable alteration his personal appearance. Then making straight quarter city mostly inhabited respectable working classes, he made friendly call Pierre Lenoir coiner, who, remembered, police unable trace since his encounter Herbert Murray waggoner. A friendly call termed it, seemed first, detective criminal shook hands friendly manner. "Hullo, friend Clermont," exclaimed Lenoir, "what brings Paris!" "Why, hot there." There pause. "And you, too," continued detective. "I heard name mentioned much late. How affair happen?" Pierre Lenoir told his friend, course he know detective, merely associate coiners like people, he tricked Markby. "But I will his life, though." "Doubtless. It bad day he falls hands." Lenoir growled fierce oath. "He escaped present, I wait years, I revenge. Pierre Lenoir never forgives." Unheedful coiner's anger, detective stroked his moustache, continued-- "But prisoners gaol yonder?" "They innocent." "Innocent!" "Undoubtedly." "Then prison?" "Because persons clear Markby myself." "Ah, I see!" "And Markby reason will not clear them." "Some old grudge, I suppose." "Yes. However, innocent; I tried them, flatly refused anything game." "Well, nice fix; manage escape little affair Markby peasant?'" "Crawled bush near possible scene fight." "Ah!" "If I gone half mile away, police would doubt found me, thick-headed rascals never thought looking half dozen yards off. Ha, ha, ha!" The detective smiled grimly. "They thick-headed rascals." And pause occupied listening sounds street, he repeated-- "And English prisoners entirely innocent then?" "Entirely." "Now listen me, Pierre Lenoir," continued detective, rapping table smartly though command attention. "But curious echo old room." "I noticed it; continue." "These English refused thing business, say?" "Yes; showed fight I would used force detain them." "Then judge knows that, young fellows released?" "Yes; but, dear friend, likely I shall go court give evidence favour." "You will." "Nonsense." "I shall take there." There something his visitor's manner made Lenoir first start his seat make hasty movement towards table. But he recoiled Hocquart Clermont Delamarre thrust revolver his face exclaimed-- "If make another movement towards drawer pistols are, I send bullet you. Keep hands side." "What fiend's name mean?" gasped coiner. "It means prisoner." "Prisoner." "Yes." "Then you?" "You known Clermont, real name Delamarre." "The detective?" "The same." The coiner gave hasty look round apartment, made step towards door. But instantly opened, appeared police officer uniform, said-- "If attempt pass door, dead man." The window! It high roadway, one bold leap might yet bring liberty. But, reading his thoughts, Delamarre gave one peculiar raps table, echoed without, instantly figure policeman armed revolver seen filling casement. The chimney! That he knew crossed strong bars. No exit way. "Sit down, Pierre Lenoir." The detective provokingly cool, coiner gnashed his teeth rage. "Sit down, man; why, ought feel proud taken neatly." "Curse you!" "Never mind. I finest easiest pair wristbands gentleman line business ever wore. Let try on." Lenoir moment contemplated resistance, two revolvers close his head, second thoughts prevailed. He firmly handcuffed. "Now, Pierre," said detective, "listen me, I quickly prove I far better friend think me." The coiner smiled bitter smile. "Of course does not look so; listen." "I compelled to," replied Lenoir. "You clear English prisoners." "If I choose speak." "If choose speak, English consul exert his influence procure mitigation sentence--whatever may be." Lenoir nodded. "But not, why, whole force British Embassy exerted you; I fancy choice soon made." Lenoir sat silent minutes. "Have made mind?" asked detective length. "I do not see I speak; belong cursed country Markby." "Well, do not see nicely things come round? You clear prisoners, incriminate Markby, _alias_ Murray." "Aye; he?" "In Marseilles. I waiting little evidence I lay hands him. He slippery customer, will not arrest case complete." "Then, curse him, I will tell all--nay, more, look drawer, pistols are, know, find note me. That quite good evidence word." "Good, Lenoir. I cannot promise free pardon, I fancy get lightly." "I hope I may sent galley Murray, _alias_ Markby, serve; I chained oar I shall happy." "Why." "I find early opportunity, I kill him." "No, Lenoir; way shorten sentence." "I will kill him." "No; lead life misery dread he chained oar. What released matter I present concern with." "March, then; let us going." And coiner walked gaily away, his anger captured replaced joy, hopes avenging treacherous Markby, _alias_ Murray. Hocquart Clermont Delamarre walked arm-in-arm coiner, good people Marseilles knew he taken. Even gaol he entered assumed name. The gaoler, attendance English party, could understand his prisoners wrote letters English consul relatives England, Herbert Murray almost suspected truth he chanced, day losing letter, look it. But Chivey reassured him. "I went clothes morning afore up, guv'nor, burnt every one letters I could find." "What for?" demanded Murray. "In case accidents. It would us good things found us; nobody ever knows going turn up." CHAPTER CIV. THE ESCORT--THE TRIAL. "Marseilles last!" exclaimed Dick Harvey, train came standstill. "I thought never end journey," said little Emily. However, quickly got clear railway station, engaged apartments hotel, then, without waiting eat drink, made way towards gaol. "I wonder house Union Jack flying it," said Mrs. Harkaway, passed along street near harbour. "The British consulate likely," said her husband "We better call there." But consul home. "Do know he gone?" asked Harvey servant. "Why, sir, Englishmen tried to-day coining, he gone watch case." "To-day?" "Yes, sir; fact, trial commence ten minutes," replied man, consulting his watch. "Where trial take place?" "The second turning left, sir. The hall justice large building round corner." "Come along, then," said Harkaway; "there time lose." They hurried along street rate made French people stare. Paquita first party turn corner, she sooner done she exclaimed-- "There are." And running file soldiers, threw her arms round Harry Girdwood's neck. Little Emily would followed her example, officer charge escort would permit irregular conduct, Paquita compelled rejoin her friends. "Hurrah, dad!" exclaimed young Jack; "I knew would turn time. And, mamma, pale looking." "Can wonder it, boy, considering anxiety suffered?" "Mr. Mole, Mr. Mole," exclaimed Dick Harvey, shaking his head, "I surprised indeed hear taken counterfeit coining." "Harvey, really joking matter," replied Mole. "No, joke chained oar one galleys harbour." "Stand back, ladies gentlemen, please," exclaimed officer commanding escort. "I cannot allow communication prisoners." So obliged keep distance. At moment portly, elderly gentleman, watching scene, came up, saying-- "Have I honour addressing Mr. Harkaway?" "That name, sir." "I English consul." Our old hero seized hand, saying-- "Sir, words powerless express grateful I interference behalf boy." "Do not mention it, sir, I I instructed cases." "But trial; chance young scapegrace stand?" "There little doubt he acquitted, best evidence his favour. But come along, sir, let us get court." The consul led way hall justice, placed Harkaway party among audience position could see going on, without conspicuous themselves. Then waited patiently till judge arrived. * * * * While young hero's father friends thus entering Marseilles, two people trying leave city. These Herbert Murray his friend Chivey. "There are not use stoppin' 'ere, guv'nor," latter said. "We see papers gets." "You right, Chivey; get away time." "We come back an' see  them fairly fixed, know." "Well, pack up, we will take trip Paris week." Their portmanteaus quickly got ready, vehicle engaged take railway station. But alighted, take tickets, polite police officer tapped Murray shoulder, said-- "I much regret ask monsieur postpone his journey." "What?" "I must request Monsieur defer his visit Paris till trial English coiners." "What me?" "The judge may desire presence, monsieur; he may wish hear evidence." "Nonsense!" "It may be; I compelled say I cannot permit leave Marseilles to-day, I must request accompany back hall justice." "We prisoners, then?" "By means. Only law requires presence, law, know, must obeyed, monsieur?" Chivey taken part conversation, looking round good chance escaping. "You, course, accompany friend?" said detective, tapping shoulder. "Must, I suppose," responded Chivey, noticed several policeman loitering station. So, bad grace, two intending excursionists walked back hall justice. The English prisoners already brought hall, trial commenced. It certainly seemed first young hero got bad fix, evidence much him. The police captured Lenoir's workshop. They seen conversation there, café police warned nefarious doings forth. "Have witnesses call, prisoner?" ask judge, addressing young Jack. "Yes, Monsieur le Juge; first Pierre Lenoir. Let called." "What folly this?" demanded judge, sternly. "I ask Pierre Lenoir shall summoned give evidence," repeated young Jack, told Delamarre line defence adopt. "Do think he respond called?" "If he respond, I shall derive benefit his evidence." "Let Pierre Lenoir called," said judge, rather angrily. And Pierre Lenoir called officer court. "Here!" The answer clear distinct. And next moment Pierre Lenoir, escorted two gensdarmes, marched court-room. Chivey touched Murray arm, idea sneaking away. But polite attentive officer brought back railway, stood doorway, evidently watching them. In fact, he spoke them. "Things getting interesting, gentlemen," said he; "it worth losing train see dramatic trial promises be." "Interferes business, rather." "Not much, monsieur. But hush!" The evidence Pierre Lenoir taken. The public prosecutor objected first his evidence; urged counsel defence although accused many offences, he present convicted none, therefore entitled full credence. "Your name Pierre Lenoir?" asked Jack's counsel. "It is." "Do know prisoners?" "But slightly." "Say met them." "I met house came invitation see specimens skill medal engraver." "Did Englishmen assist way pass counterfeit coin?" "Neither Englishmen; man did." And turning half round, he pointed wretched Murray, _alias_ Markby. And time affable police officer drew nearer, smiling blandly ever. "It Is false!" shrieked wretched Murray. "The public must maintain silence court," said judge. "It is base lie!" exclaimed Murray. "The officer court arrest disorderly person." The smiling gendarme swooped his prey. "That man," continued Lenoir, "not passed bad money me, he persuaded prisoners would also. But I introduced tried get join me, absolutely refused." The public prosecutor tried vain shake his story, he positively adhered every word he spoken. Then Harkaway senior called upon, he conjunction banker proved need whatever prisoners commit offence, simply signing his name young Jack could draw far francs judge's yearly salary amounted to. The counsel defence challenged prosecution produce evidence prisoners passed bad money, public prosecutor obliged confess he could so. Whereupon judge remarked prosecution utterly failed, directed prisoners discharged. But Lenoir Murray directed kept separate cells till could tried, Chivey ordered like accommodation. And plenty time reflection, Herbert Murray sat irons his arms legs, thinking dolefully past, thinking whether, all, honesty would proved best policy. CHAPTER CV. A LAST VIEW OF MURRAY AND CHIVEY. "Hurrah, dad!" "Hurrah, boy! Now, then, one all. Hip, hip, hip----" "Hurrah!" The peal burst throats reunited English party fairly astonished assembled crowd citizens flocking hall justice. And shaking hands kissing! The latter form insanity length became infectious, two black imps Tinker Bogey insisted pressing chaste salute Mr. Mole's coy lips, intense amusement bystanders. "Get out, black devils!" exclaimed he. "Why, Massa Mole, good friends dis long time dat 'ere ole prison; is not a-gwine turn round de poor niggahs we's got out." "Get away. Never mind, do not get away; I am proud--hurrah!" In his excitement Mr. Mole threw his battered hat great height air, slipping doing, he sat upon pavement rather violently. "_Sac-r-r-r-ré!_ seize old villain!" The indignant command came mounted officer charge considerable body soldiers. While directing movements his men, drawn sword hand, came Mole's _chapeau_ point deadly weapon, went crown, lining getting entangled hilt, could readily moved. And, course, French spectators began laughing see rather absurd situation officer. Mole would certainly dragged British consul interposed. "Monsieur le Colonel, I hasten assure accident," he said. "I insulted accident; arrest him!" "But consider, sir, crime urge him." "Bah, care I?" "He apologise." "Of course he will," said Harvey, thinking time interpose. "Here, you, Mr. Mole?" "Down here, sitting end me," responded ex-tutor doleful accents. "An apology!" said excited officer, dismounted, brandishing his weapon though sacrifice Mole. But poor Mole seemed altogether confused say soothing words required, consul interfered. "Really, Monsieur le Colonel, poor gentleman seems sustained severe injury. You see he lost legs series heroic actions, particulars I time give you, accept assurance affair hat entirely accident." "Lost legs action! Ah, becomes duty apologise hasty language I used brave soldier." As things changing little, Mole thought time become conscious, aid Tinker Bogey, he struggled his feet. "Monsieur," continued officer, "I withdraw words." "Enough said, dear sir," responded Mole; "let matter drop, I pray." The officer gave military salute, restored perforated hat owner, rejoined his men. "Really imprisonment seems effect you, Mr. Mole," said Harvey; "you begin old pranks moment released." "What mean?" "Why, pass old soldier." "No, good friend consul." "Well, allowed colonel deceive himself." "It is result really martial aspect, dear boy." And Mole hobbled on, trying sustain his military appearance. * * * * Our friends leave Marseilles. They informed perhaps might required give evidence Murray, took residence best hotel place waited, elders party perfectly content youngsters regained liberty. However, events turned out, called upon attend trial shipowner's son, Monsieur Hocquart Clermont Delamarre his assistants managed pile quite sufficient proof convince judge Herbert Murray's guilt. He, Lenoir, Chivey, certainly deeply involved his master, sentenced serve ten years galleys. Lenoir's original sentence fifteen years, promised intercession consul effectual shortening ten. There was, however, another trial, young Jack Harry Girdwood requested attend, prisoner case gaoler entrusted letters consul. He clearly convicted receiving bribes prisoners, sentenced two years' imprisonment, retires scene. Young Jack, his parents, Harry Girdwood, Harvey, little Emily, Paquita taking walk neighborhood harbour one morning, became aware dismal-looking procession coming road prison. First came half dozen soldiers, trailing rifles, evidently loaded ready instant use. Then, single file, yard behind other, every man his right leg attached ring long chain extended entire length party, came ten men clad garments coarse serge, closely-cropped heads. The instant he saw distance, young Jack guessed meant, pointed gang others. "Let us get away can," said he. "Why?" asked Harvey. "Because look though came simply gloat disgrace," replied Jack. "Right, boy." But way avoiding them, turning street, house doors closed, compelled see all. First came seven lowest-looking ruffians creation, villains whose countenances expressive nothing brutality vice; eighth Chivey, whose cheeks bore traces tears, ninth Pierre Lenoir, walked erect proud Lucifer, except he made half turn though he would like strangle Herbert Murray, walked tottering steps end chain. "Poor fellows!" said Mrs. Harkaway. "They deserve it," exclaimed her husband Harvey, simultaneously. "They tried get boys punishment overtaken them." Our friends, however, seen enough, care witness followed. If gone inside harbour gates, might seen three four long sharp-bowed vessels moored quay lying anchor little way out. Neither mast sail vessels, side projected dozen gigantic oars larger used Thames bargemen. Had gone harbour would presently seen chained up, two oar, feet far liberty could move backwards forwards three paces. Then would heard word command given, would seen poor slaves tugging away oars till huge craft sweeping rapidly sea, galley-master walking two rows oarsmen, gave blows his whip right hand left he saw man flagging, oar swing unison rest. Such fate career crime brought son respected shipowner Murray. Slavery morn till night, beneath broiling sun, exposed cold, rain, hail, coarsest black bread lentil pottage, formed his scanty meal; his associates lowest type humanity. And even hard lot fell upon his heart craven fear day Lenoir, chained next oar, would break loose kill him. Many would preferred death slavery, Herbert Murray feared die. "Hollo, Englishman, faster!" galley-master would shout. And his whip cane would sharply visit poor Murray's shoulders. And chuckling voice Lenoir would heard, exclaiming-- "Ah, traitor! nothing suffer I chance revenge." CHAPTER CVI. TERRIBLE RAILWAY ACCIDENT. Three days Murray Chivey embarked dreary voyage Harkaway party quitted Marseilles. The waiter diver, long young Jack's companions adventure, preferred remaining Marseilles. They home ties, long accustomed wandering Continental life, great desire settle quietly England. However, Harkaway senior made handsome present each, he also presented Monsieur Hocquart Clermont Delamarre substantial proof his esteem gratitude, detective gratified receiving two young ladies, Paquita Emily, handsomely-mounted _carte de visite_ portrait. "And home!" exclaimed young hero. "You sorry get there, will not you?" said Emily. "No, dear; I be?" "Because England cannot go doing, running away fair Circass----" There nobody looking, Jack took liberty cutting reproach short kiss. "You must say thing that, dear Emily; and, all, I do not think would approved leaving her mercy Turks." "That I not, Jack." The youth handed his young sweetheart one vehicles waiting, started railway, found wait ten minutes. To occupy time strolled platform. Suddenly Harry Girdwood exclaimed-- "Why, Mr. Mole? Did he come carriage, Jack?" "No; I thought he you." "Left behind, Jove!" exclaimed Harvey. "Serve right I left behind entirely," said Harkaway senior, rather angrily. He point sending one porters back hotel, Mr. Mole appeared. Now two things delayed him. One morning Mr. Mole mounted new pair artificial legs made best surgical instrument maker Marseilles. Some time taken proper adjustment these. For second reason--Mr. Mole discovered hotel cellars contained excellent brandy, he taking parting glass Irish diver commencing his journey. And he made his appearance railway platform, he thing steady his new legs. "Better late never, Mr. Mole," said Harvey. "I late." "Yes, sir. Two minutes more, train here." An engine fact moment shunting carriages attached train. Mr. Mole turned hearing noise approaching locomotive. But being, aforesaid, slightly unsteady his legs, he fell. Fell right across metals. "Oh! help!" he cried. But anyone could stir, engine upon him. The porters shouted, ladies screamed fright. "Oh, Heaven! horrible?" exclaimed French man. "Did hear bones crash wheels went his legs?" "Over his legs," shouted Harvey. "Ha, ha! all, matter much." The engine stopped, Mole rescued his perilous position. He fainted, glass water restored him. "Are hurt, old man?" asked Dick. "No; I think not. It is legs, nothing else." "Great Heaven, narrow escape!" "So is; nuisance, legs cut clean off, six inches ankle." "Here, porter, put gentleman first-class carriage," said Harkaway senior. "But, monsieur, he must taken hospital; surgeon close hand." "Doctor hanged! This gentleman must go Paris next train." The porters, evidently unwilling touch Mr. Mole, Harkaway said-- "Here, lend hand, old man." "All right," responded Harvey. The pair immediately hoisted Mr. Mole carriage, others took seats, engineer blew his whistle, went. To complete horror spectators, admired Mole's fortitude, loathed apparent barbarity his friends, train moving off, Harvey plainly seen cut old gentleman's shattered limbs, pitch empty goods waggons going another direction. "What horrid barbarians!" general exclamation bewildered spectators strange scene. "A pretty object made certainly," grumbled Mole, looking his curtailed legs. "Your fault, Mr. Mole," responded Harvey. "Lucky head, Mr. Mole," said young Jack. "You me, I see, matter." So saying, Mole took his pocket flask refresh himself. But Harkaway senior, stretching his hand, took flask. "No, Mr. Mole; more, I fear shall serious accident. So drop till first time stop." "Why, mail train, stops every two hours." "And I quite sure exist without brandy little time." "Well, I suppose I may smoke then?" "Certainly; shall one best regalias." Mr. Mole took weed, puffed away rather sulkily. They got eight miles Marseilles suddenly engine slackened speed, train drew little roadside station. "What mean?" said Harvey. "We ought stop here." "This first stopping place, however, I will trouble flask, according promise," said Mole, beaming countenance. Harkaway handed settling back he heard police official asking-- "Where gentleman run Marseilles?" "Here," said Harkaway. The gendarme ran spot, his intense surprise saw victim accident act taking hearty drink his brandy flask his left hand held lighted cigar. "What want?" demanded Mole. "The officials Marseilles, unable stop train, telegraphed see proper medical attendance." "Ha, ha, ha! look here, old boy; I always carry physic. Taste it." The officer took flask, finding smell familiar, applied his lips. "The fact is," said Harkaway, "the gentleman wearing wooden legs, damaged." "Indeed; think able proceed journey, sir?" "Yes, leave medicine." The gendarme bowed, handed back flask, train rolled away. CHAPTER CVII. A DUEL. "Paris last," exclaimed Harvey. "That is good job, I tired sitting, want stretch legs; do not you, Mr. Mole?" said young Jack. "Do not ridiculous, Jack," replied Mr. Mole. Harkaway senior, looking window, drew his head said-- "Well, Mr. Mole, nice fix." "How?" "I do not see any----" "Any what?" "Any cabs." "The ----" "Do not swear." "My dear Mr. Harkaway, without legs, would swear?" "Cannot say, proper number pins." "You will walk," said Harvey. "There is cab station." "But I walk?" "Do not remember hero ballad Chevy Chase?" "Who he?" "The song says Witherington, call Mole." "'For Mole, indeed, heart woe, As one doleful dumps; For his feet cut away, He walked upon his stumps.'" By time train stopped, party got out, except Mole. As Harkaway said, vehicle station outside it, Mr. Mole obliged remain till his friends could hit upon plan removing him. A porter first make suggestion. "An artificial limb maker lives opposite, monsieur," said he. "Ah!" "If I carried monsieur over, he might some--ah--substitutes fitted on." "A capital idea!" exclaimed Harvey; "over him." And Mole could remonstrate, he hoisted porter's shoulders, trotted across street. Great joy Parisian _gamins_ sight provided amusement. Mole, however, bravely bore chaff, half he understand. The maker artificial limbs soon fitted poor Mole pair legs. But alas! No sooner he stood upon his friends burst loud laugh. "What matter you?" demanded Mr. Mole, felt inclined stand his dignity well his new legs. "Ha, ha, ha!" "I wonder do not remember Goldsmith says," continued Mole. "What he say, Mr. Mole?" "Do not remember line 'the loud laugh speaks vacant mind.' I fear mind must vacant, Mr. Harvey." "He there, Uncle Dick," said young Jack. "Pooh! But look his legs." "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed young Jack turn. Mr. Mole's trousers, recollected, cut away knees immediately his railway accident, he stood pair nicely-varnished boots, could seen various springs hinges his mechanical limbs. The trouser legs longer proportion small boy's knickerbockers. By time, however, cab two turned up, and, ladies fetched railway waiting-room, whole party proceeded one many good hotels Paris possesses. * * * * The third evening arrival, young Jack Harry Girdwood strolled together. They doubt would enjoyed company two girls, little Emily Paquita roving town day long, tired go evening. "What place, Jack?" asked Harry, paused front narrow, brilliantly-lighted doorway. "A shooting gallery, I fancy." "Shall go in?" "Certainly; I do not fancy French great 'shootists,' Yankees say." "All fun, perhaps." And without talk, youngsters walked in. It long room, divided slight partitions four different galleries, end target shape doll. After watching others time, Harry took half dozen shots one figures, he struck four times. Young Jack tried, equally successful. "Good shooting, young gentlemen," said one spectators, Englishman; "but want see real pistol practice, look Frenchman." And he pointed tall, dark man preparing fire. The target he little doll like others, full-sized lay figure dressed black, closely buttoned up, holding hand empty pistol pointed towards live shooter. "He noted duellist," said Englishman, "and killed one adversary." Jack Harry looked considerable curiosity, mixed tinge loathing. The duellist brought his pistols, one he carefully loaded, placed position, rapidly aimed fired. Instantly lay figure showed spot white black coat, which, all, made kind paste varnish, chipped struck bullet. "Straight heart," said Englishman. "That is good shooting," exclaimed Harry Girdwood. The Frenchman fired again, making equally good shot. When he fired ten, young Jack first time broke silence. "I do not believe he could field live adversary loaded pistol opposite him." The Frenchman pulled trigger, eleventh shot flew wide mark. Almost foaming passion missed his aim, he dashed weapon ground. "I must request gentleman spoke stand test." "With great pleasure," responded Jack, coolly. The Frenchman stared speaker. "Bah! I do not fight boys." "Then I shall proclaim Paris cur, try back quarrel challenge accepted." "Very well, then, shall die morning. Henri,"--this friend--"arrange English boy's second he one; he not, find one." The Englishman previously spoken stepped forward offered his services. "Although," said he, "I much prefer see affair settled peacefully." "I entirely hands, sir," responded Jack. And he retired side room. "Jack, Jack! demon possessed get mess?" "No demon, Harry, father's hot blood. He always prompt accept challenge." "He let fight." "He know till settled. Listen me, Harry, tell anyone else, try stop plan second may propose, I swear I will never speak again." "But stand every chance killed." "Harry, us faced death many times, I sure I going turn back Frenchman." Poor Harry could say nothing more. The Englishman rejoined them. "I cannot get fellow accept apology----!" "That is right," interposed Jack. His second looked surprised youth's coolness, continued-- "So I must parade Bois de Boulogne sunrise. It is hour's drive." "Where shall meet you?" The second hesitated, named time place. "Now," said Jack, "I go little sleep; home, somewhere neighbourhood." They went respectable hotel close by, Jack, made simple arrangements (including message Emily), case killed, laid his bed, soon slumbering peacefully. * * * * About quarter hour sun risen, upon ground. Jack Harry second, Frenchman his. There also surgeon present. Little time lost. The pistols loaded, according previous arrangement two seconds, lighter charge usual, Jack might possibly escape flesh wound instead hole drilled right him. The combatants placed half facing other, fifteen paces apart. "There grave suspicion afloat adversary ugly knack pulling trigger half second soon," whispered Jack's second, "so I going give caution." A pistol placed hand each, Jack's second spoke. "Listen, gentlemen. You fire I give word three. If either pulls trigger word pronounced, murder." He looked Frenchman, counted-- "One, two, three!"
