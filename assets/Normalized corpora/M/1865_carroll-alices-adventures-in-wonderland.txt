 ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND CHAPTER I. Down Rabbit-Hole Alice beginning get tired sitting her sister bank, nothing do: twice she peeped book her sister reading, pictures conversations it, “and use book,” thought Alice “without pictures conversations?” So she considering her mind (as well she could, hot day made her feel sleepy stupid), whether pleasure making daisy-chain would worth trouble getting picking daisies, suddenly White Rabbit pink eyes ran close her. There nothing _very_ remarkable that; Alice think _very_ much way hear Rabbit say itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall late!” (when she thought afterwards, occurred her she ought wondered this, time seemed quite natural); Rabbit actually _took watch waistcoat-pocket_, looked it, hurried on, Alice started her feet, flashed across her mind she never seen rabbit either waistcoat-pocket, watch take it, burning curiosity, she ran across field it, fortunately time see pop large rabbit-hole hedge. In another moment went Alice it, never considering world she get again. The rabbit-hole went straight like tunnel way, dipped suddenly down, suddenly Alice moment think stopping herself she found herself falling deep well. Either well deep, she fell slowly, she plenty time she went look her wonder going happen next. First, she tried look make she coming to, dark see anything; she looked sides well, noticed filled cupboards book-shelves; she saw maps pictures hung upon pegs. She took jar one shelves she passed; labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, her great disappointment empty: she like drop jar fear killing somebody underneath, managed put one cupboards she fell past it. “Well!” thought Alice herself, “after fall this, I shall think nothing tumbling stairs! How brave they will think home! Why, I would not say anything it, even I fell top house!” (Which likely true.) Down, down, down. Would fall _never_ come end? “I wonder many miles I have fallen time?” she said aloud. “I must getting somewhere near centre earth. Let see: would four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, see, Alice learnt several things sort her lessons schoolroom, though _very_ good opportunity showing her knowledge, one listen her, still good practice say over) “—yes, that is right distance—but I wonder Latitude Longitude I have got to?” (Alice idea Latitude was, Longitude either, thought nice grand words say.) Presently she began again. “I wonder I shall fall right _through_ earth! How funny it will seem come among people walk heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she rather glad _was_ one listening, time, did not sound right word) “—but I shall ask name country is, know. Please, Madam, New Zealand Australia?” (and she tried curtsey she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ you are falling air! Do think could manage it?) “And ignorant little girl she will think asking! No, it will never ask: perhaps I shall see written somewhere.” Down, down, down. There nothing else do, Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss much to-night, I think!” (Dinah cat.) “I hope they will remember her saucer milk tea-time. Dinah dear! I wish me! There mice air, I am afraid, might catch bat, that is like mouse, know. But cats eat bats, I wonder?” And Alice began get rather sleepy, went saying herself, dreamy sort way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, see, she could not answer either question, did not much matter way she put it. She felt she dozing off, begun dream she walking hand hand Dinah, saying her earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell truth: ever eat bat?” suddenly, thump! thump! she came upon heap sticks dry leaves, fall over. Alice bit hurt, she jumped her feet moment: she looked up, dark overhead; her another long passage, White Rabbit still sight, hurrying it. There moment lost: away went Alice like wind, time hear say, turned corner, “Oh ears whiskers, late it is getting!” She close behind she turned corner, Rabbit longer seen: she found herself long, low hall, lit row lamps hanging roof. There doors round hall, locked; Alice way one side other, trying every door, she walked sadly middle, wondering she ever get again. Suddenly she came upon little three-legged table, made solid glass; nothing except tiny golden key, Alice’s first thought might belong one doors hall; but, alas! either locks large, key small, rate would open them. However, second time round, she came upon low curtain she noticed before, behind little door fifteen inches high: she tried little golden key lock, her great delight fitted! Alice opened door found led small passage, much larger rat-hole: she knelt looked along passage loveliest garden ever saw. How she longed get dark hall, wander among beds bright flowers cool fountains, she could even get her head doorway; “and even head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would little use without shoulders. Oh, I wish I could shut like telescope! I think I could, I knew begin.” For, see, many out-of-the-way things happened lately, Alice begun think things indeed really impossible. There seemed use waiting little door, she went back table, half hoping she might find another key it, rate book rules shutting people like telescopes: time she found little bottle it, (“which certainly before,” said Alice,) round neck bottle paper label, words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed large letters. It well say “Drink me,” wise little Alice going _that_ hurry. “No, I will look first,” she said, “and see whether it is marked ‘_poison_’ not”; she read several nice little histories children got burnt, eaten wild beasts unpleasant things, _would_ remember simple rules friends taught them: as, red-hot poker burn hold long; cut finger _very_ deeply knife, usually bleeds; she never forgotten that, drink much bottle marked “poison,” almost certain disagree you, sooner later. However, bottle _not_ marked “poison,” Alice ventured taste it, finding nice, (it had, fact, sort mixed flavour cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, hot buttered toast,) she soon finished off. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * “What curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must shutting like telescope.” And indeed: she ten inches high, her face brightened thought she right size going little door lovely garden. First, however, she waited minutes see she going shrink further: she felt little nervous this; “for might end, know,” said Alice herself, “in going altogether, like candle. I wonder I like then?” And she tried fancy flame candle like candle blown out, she could remember ever seen thing. After while, finding nothing happened, she decided going garden once; but, alas poor Alice! she got door, she found she forgotten little golden key, she went back table it, she found she could possibly reach it: she could see quite plainly glass, she tried her best climb one legs table, slippery; she tired herself trying, poor little thing sat cried. “Come, there is use crying like that!” said Alice herself, rather sharply; “I advise leave minute!” She generally gave herself good advice, (though she seldom followed it), sometimes she scolded herself severely bring tears her eyes; she remembered trying box her ears cheated herself game croquet she playing herself, curious child fond pretending two people. “But it is use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend two people! Why, there is hardly enough left make _one_ respectable person!” Soon her eye fell little glass box lying table: she opened it, found small cake, words “EAT ME” beautifully marked currants. “Well, I will eat it,” said Alice, “and makes grow larger, I reach key; makes grow smaller, I creep door; either way I will get garden, I do not care happens!” She ate little bit, said anxiously herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding her hand top her head feel way growing, she quite surprised find she remained size: sure, generally happens one eats cake, Alice got much way expecting nothing out-of-the-way things happen, seemed quite dull stupid life go common way. So she set work, soon finished cake. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II. The Pool Tears “Curiouser curiouser!” cried Alice (she much surprised, moment she quite forgot speak good English); “now I am opening like largest telescope ever was! Good-bye, feet!” (for she looked her feet, seemed almost sight, getting far off). “Oh, poor little feet, I wonder put shoes stockings now, dears? I am sure _I_ shall not able! I shall great deal far trouble you: must manage best way can;—but I must kind them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps will not walk way I want go! Let see: I will give new pair boots every Christmas.” And she went planning herself she would manage it. “They must go carrier,” she thought; “and funny it will seem, sending presents one’s feet! And odd directions look! _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near Fender,_ (_with Alice’s love_). Oh dear, nonsense I am talking!” Just her head struck roof hall: fact she nine feet high, she took little golden key hurried garden door. Poor Alice! It much she could do, lying one side, look garden one eye; get hopeless ever: she sat began cry again. “You ought ashamed yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like you,” (she might well say this), “to go crying way! Stop moment, I tell you!” But she went same, shedding gallons tears, large pool round her, four inches deep reaching half hall. After time she heard little pattering feet distance, she hastily dried her eyes see coming. It White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, pair white kid gloves one hand large fan other: he came trotting along great hurry, muttering he came, “Oh! Duchess, Duchess! Oh! will not she savage I have kept her waiting!” Alice felt desperate she ready ask help one; so, Rabbit came near her, she began, low, timid voice, “If please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped white kid gloves fan, skurried away darkness hard he could go. Alice took fan gloves, and, hall hot, she kept fanning herself time she went talking: “Dear, dear! How queer everything to-day! And yesterday things went usual. I wonder I have changed night? Let think: I I got morning? I almost think I remember feeling little different. But I am same, next question is, Who world I? Ah, _that’s_ great puzzle!” And she began thinking children she knew age herself, see she could changed them. “I am sure I am Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes long ringlets, mine does not go ringlets all; I am sure I cannot Mabel, I know sorts things, she, oh! she knows little! Besides, _she’s_ she, _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, puzzling is! I will try I know things I used know. Let see: four times five twelve, four times six thirteen, four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get twenty rate! However, Multiplication Table does not signify: let us try Geography. London capital Paris, Paris capital Rome, Rome—no, _that’s_ wrong, I am certain! I must changed Mabel! I will try say ‘_How doth little_—’” she crossed her hands her lap she saying lessons, began repeat it, her voice sounded hoarse strange, words come used do:— “How doth little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour waters Nile On every golden scale! “How cheerfully he seems grin, How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes With gently smiling jaws!” “I am sure right words,” said poor Alice, her eyes filled tears she went on, “I must Mabel all, I shall go live poky little house, next toys play with, oh! ever many lessons learn! No, I have made mind it; I am Mabel, I will stay here! It will use putting heads saying ‘Come again, dear!’ I shall look say ‘Who I then? Tell first, then, I like person, I will come up: not, I will stay till I am somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, sudden burst tears, “I wish _would_ put heads down! I _very_ tired alone here!” As she said she looked her hands, surprised see she put one Rabbit’s little white kid gloves she talking. “How _can_ I done that?” she thought. “I must growing small again.” She got went table measure herself it, found that, nearly she could guess, she two feet high, going shrinking rapidly: she soon found fan she holding, she dropped hastily, time avoid shrinking away altogether. “That _was_ narrow escape!” said Alice, good deal frightened sudden change, glad find herself still existence; “and garden!” she ran speed back little door: but, alas! little door shut again, little golden key lying glass table before, “and things worse ever,” thought poor child, “for I never small before, never! And I declare it is bad, is!” As she said words her foot slipped, another moment, splash! she her chin salt water. Her first idea she somehow fallen sea, “and case I go back railway,” she said herself. (Alice seaside her life, come general conclusion, wherever go English coast find number bathing machines sea, children digging sand wooden spades, row lodging houses, behind railway station.) However, she soon made she pool tears she wept she nine feet high. “I wish I had not cried much!” said Alice, she swam about, trying find her way out. “I shall punished now, I suppose, drowned tears! That _will_ queer thing, sure! However, everything queer to-day.” Just she heard something splashing pool little way off, she swam nearer make was: first she thought must walrus hippopotamus, she remembered small she now, she soon made mouse slipped like herself. “Would use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak mouse? Everything out-of-the-way here, I think likely talk: rate, there is harm trying.” So she began: “O Mouse, know way pool? I tired swimming here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought must right way speaking mouse: she never done thing before, she remembered seen her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of mouse—to mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked her rather inquisitively, seemed her wink one little eyes, said nothing. “Perhaps does not understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it is French mouse, come William Conqueror.” (For, her knowledge history, Alice clear notion long ago anything happened.) So she began again: “Où est chatte?” first sentence her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave sudden leap water, seemed quiver fright. “Oh, I beg pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid she hurt poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot did not like cats.” “Not like cats!” cried Mouse, shrill, passionate voice. “Would _you_ like cats me?” “Well, perhaps not,” said Alice soothing tone: “do not angry it. And yet I wish I could show cat Dinah: I think you would take fancy cats could see her. She dear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half herself, she swam lazily pool, “and she sits purring nicely fire, licking her paws washing her face—and she nice soft thing nurse—and she is capital one catching mice—oh, I beg pardon!” cried Alice again, time Mouse bristling over, she felt certain must really offended. “We will not talk her you would rather not.” “We indeed!” cried Mouse, trembling end his tail. “As _I_ would talk subject! Our family always _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Do not let hear name again!” “I will not indeed!” said Alice, great hurry change subject conversation. “Are you—are fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse answer, Alice went eagerly: “There nice little dog near house I like show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, know, oh, long curly brown hair! And it will fetch things throw them, it will sit beg dinner, sorts things—I cannot remember half them—and belongs farmer, know, he says it is useful, it is worth hundred pounds! He says kills rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice sorrowful tone, “I am afraid I have offended again!” For Mouse swimming away her hard could go, making quite commotion pool went. So she called softly it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, will not talk cats dogs either, do not like them!” When Mouse heard this, turned round swam slowly back her: face quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), said low trembling voice, “Let us get shore, I will tell history, you will understand I hate cats dogs.” It high time go, pool getting quite crowded birds animals fallen it: Duck Dodo, Lory Eaglet, several curious creatures. Alice led way, whole party swam shore. CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race Long Tale They indeed queer-looking party assembled bank—the birds draggled feathers, animals fur clinging close them, dripping wet, cross, uncomfortable. The first question course was, get dry again: consultation this, minutes seemed quite natural Alice find herself talking familiarly them, she known her life. Indeed, she quite long argument Lory, last turned sulky, would say, “I older you, must know better;” Alice would allow without knowing old was, and, Lory positively refused tell age, said. At last Mouse, seemed person authority among them, called out, “Sit down, you, listen me! _I’ll_ soon make dry enough!” They sat once, large ring, Mouse middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed it, she felt sure she would catch bad cold she get dry soon. “Ahem!” said Mouse important air, “are ready? This driest thing I know. Silence round, please! ‘William Conqueror, whose favoured pope, soon submitted English, wanted leaders, late much accustomed usurpation conquest. Edwin Morcar, earls Mercia Northumbria—’” “Ugh!” said Lory, shiver. “I beg pardon!” said Mouse, frowning, politely: “Did speak?” “Not I!” said Lory hastily. “I thought did,” said Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin Morcar, earls Mercia Northumbria, declared him: even Stigand, patriotic archbishop Canterbury, found advisable—’” “Found _what_?” said Duck. “Found _it_,” Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course know ‘it’ means.” “I know ‘it’ means well enough, _I_ find thing,” said Duck: “it is generally frog worm. The question is, archbishop find?” The Mouse notice question, hurriedly went on, “‘—found advisable go Edgar Atheling meet William offer crown. William’s conduct first moderate. But insolence his Normans—’ How getting now, dear?” continued, turning Alice spoke. “As wet ever,” said Alice melancholy tone: “it does not seem dry all.” “In case,” said Dodo solemnly, rising feet, “I move meeting adjourn, immediate adoption energetic remedies—” “Speak English!” said Eaglet. “I do not know meaning half long words, and, what is more, I do not believe either!” And Eaglet bent head hide smile: birds tittered audibly. “What I going say,” said Dodo offended tone, “was, best thing get us dry would Caucus-race.” “What _is_ Caucus-race?” said Alice; she wanted much know, Dodo paused thought _somebody_ ought speak, one else seemed inclined say anything. “Why,” said Dodo, “the best way explain it.” (And, might like try thing yourself, winter day, I tell Dodo managed it.) First marked race-course, sort circle, (“the exact shape does not matter,” said,) party placed along course, there. There “One, two, three, away,” began running liked, left liked, easy know race over. However, running half hour so, quite dry again, Dodo suddenly called “The race over!” crowded round it, panting, asking, “But won?” This question Dodo could answer without great deal thought, sat long time one finger pressed upon forehead (the position usually see Shakespeare, pictures him), rest waited silence. At last Dodo said, “_Everybody_ won, must prizes.” “But give prizes?” quite chorus voices asked. “Why, _she_, course,” said Dodo, pointing Alice one finger; whole party crowded round her, calling confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!” Alice idea do, despair she put her hand her pocket, pulled box comfits, (luckily salt water got it), handed round prizes. There exactly one a-piece, round. “But she must prize herself, know,” said Mouse. “Of course,” Dodo replied gravely. “What else got pocket?” he went on, turning Alice. “Only thimble,” said Alice sadly. “Hand here,” said Dodo. Then crowded round her more, Dodo solemnly presented thimble, saying “We beg acceptance elegant thimble;” and, finished short speech, cheered. Alice thought whole thing absurd, looked grave she dare laugh; and, she could think anything say, she simply bowed, took thimble, looking solemn she could. The next thing eat comfits: caused noise confusion, large birds complained could taste theirs, small ones choked patted back. However, last, sat ring, begged Mouse tell something more. “You promised tell history, know,” said Alice, “and hate—C D,” she added whisper, half afraid would offended again. “Mine long sad tale!” said Mouse, turning Alice, sighing. “It _is_ long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking wonder Mouse’s tail; “but call sad?” And she kept puzzling Mouse speaking, her idea tale something like this:— “Fury said mouse, That he met house, ‘Let us go law: _I_ prosecute _you_.—Come, I will take denial; We must trial: For really morning I have nothing do.’ Said mouse cur, ‘Such trial, dear sir, With jury judge, would wasting breath.’ ‘I will judge, I will jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I will try whole because, condemn death.’” “You attending!” said Mouse Alice severely. “What thinking of?” “I beg pardon,” said Alice humbly: “you got fifth bend, I think?” “I _not!_” cried Mouse, sharply angrily. “A knot!” said Alice, always ready make herself useful, looking anxiously her. “Oh, let help undo it!” “I shall nothing sort,” said Mouse, getting walking away. “You insult talking nonsense!” “I did not mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you are easily offended, know!” The Mouse growled reply. “Please come back finish story!” Alice called it; others joined chorus, “Yes, please do!” Mouse shook head impatiently, walked little quicker. “What pity would not stay!” sighed Lory, soon quite sight; old Crab took opportunity saying her daughter “Ah, dear! Let lesson never lose _your_ temper!” “Hold tongue, Ma!” said young Crab, little snappishly. “You are enough try patience oyster!” “I wish I Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud, addressing nobody particular. “She would soon fetch back!” “And Dinah, I might venture ask question?” said Lory. Alice replied eagerly, she always ready talk her pet: “Dinah’s cat. And she is capital one catching mice cannot think! And oh, I wish could see her birds! Why, she will eat little bird soon look it!” This speech caused remarkable sensation among party. Some birds hurried once: one old Magpie began wrapping carefully, remarking, “I really must getting home; night-air does not suit throat!” Canary called trembling voice children, “Come away, dears! It is high time bed!” On various pretexts moved off, Alice soon left alone. “I wish I had not mentioned Dinah!” she said herself melancholy tone. “Nobody seems like her, here, I am sure she is best cat world! Oh, dear Dinah! I wonder I shall ever see more!” And poor Alice began cry again, she felt lonely low-spirited. In little while, however, she heard little pattering footsteps distance, she looked eagerly, half hoping Mouse changed his mind, coming back finish his story. CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends Little Bill It White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, looking anxiously went, lost something; she heard muttering “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh dear paws! Oh fur whiskers! She will get executed, sure ferrets ferrets! Where _can_ I dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed moment looking fan pair white kid gloves, she good-naturedly began hunting them, nowhere seen—everything seemed changed since her swim pool, great hall, glass table little door, vanished completely. Very soon Rabbit noticed Alice, she went hunting about, called her angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, _are_ here? Run home moment, fetch pair gloves fan! Quick, now!” And Alice much frightened she ran direction pointed to, without trying explain mistake made. “He took his housemaid,” she said herself she ran. “How surprised he will he finds I am! But I would better take his fan gloves—that is, I find them.” As she said this, she came upon neat little house, door bright brass plate name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went without knocking, hurried upstairs, great fear lest she meet real Mary Ann, turned house she found fan gloves. “How queer seems,” Alice said herself, “to going messages rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll sending messages next!” And she began fancying sort thing would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come directly, get ready walk!’ ‘Coming minute, nurse! But I have got see mouse does not get out.’ Only I do not think,” Alice went on, “that they would let Dinah stop house began ordering people like that!” By time she found her way tidy little room table window, (as she hoped) fan two three pairs tiny white kid gloves: she took fan pair gloves, going leave room, her eye fell upon little bottle stood near looking-glass. There label time words “DRINK ME,” nevertheless she uncorked put her lips. “I know _something_ interesting sure happen,” she said herself, “whenever I eat drink anything; I will see bottle does. I hope it will make grow large again, really I am quite tired tiny little thing!” It indeed, much sooner she expected: she drunk half bottle, she found her head pressing ceiling, stoop save her neck broken. She hastily put bottle, saying herself “That is quite enough—I hope I shall not grow more—As is, I cannot get door—I wish I had not drunk quite much!” Alas! late wish that! She went growing, growing, soon kneel floor: another minute even room this, she tried effect lying one elbow door, arm curled round her head. Still she went growing, and, last resource, she put one arm window, one foot chimney, said herself “Now I more, whatever happens. What _will_ become me?” Luckily Alice, little magic bottle full effect, she grew larger: still uncomfortable, and, seemed sort chance her ever getting room again, wonder she felt unhappy. “It much pleasanter home,” thought poor Alice, “when one was not always growing larger smaller, ordered mice rabbits. I almost wish I had not gone rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it is rather curious, know, sort life! I wonder _can_ happened me! When I used read fairy-tales, I fancied kind thing never happened, I middle one! There ought book written me, ought! And I grow up, I will write one—but I am grown now,” she added sorrowful tone; “at least there is room grow _here_.” “But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get older I now? That will comfort, one way—never old woman—but then—always lessons learn! Oh, I should not like _that!_” “Oh, foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How learn lessons here? Why, there is hardly room _you_, room lesson-books!” And she went on, taking first one side other, making quite conversation altogether; minutes she heard voice outside, stopped listen. “Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said voice. “Fetch gloves moment!” Then came little pattering feet stairs. Alice knew Rabbit coming look her, she trembled till she shook house, quite forgetting she thousand times large Rabbit, reason afraid it. Presently Rabbit came door, tried open it; but, door opened inwards, Alice’s elbow pressed hard it, attempt proved failure. Alice heard say “Then I will go round get window.” “_That_ will not!” thought Alice, and, waiting till she fancied she heard Rabbit window, she suddenly spread her hand, made snatch air. She get hold anything, she heard little shriek fall, crash broken glass, she concluded possible fallen cucumber-frame, something sort. Next came angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where you?” And voice she never heard before, “Sure I am here! Digging apples, yer honour!” “Digging apples, indeed!” said Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come help _this!_” (Sounds broken glass.) “Now tell me, Pat, what is window?” “Sure, it is arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced “arrum.”) “An arm, goose! Who ever saw one size? Why, fills whole window!” “Sure, does, yer honour: it is arm that.” “Well, it is got business there, rate: go take away!” There long silence this, Alice could hear whispers then; as, “Sure, I do not like it, yer honour, all, all!” “Do I tell you, coward!” last she spread her hand again, made another snatch air. This time _two_ little shrieks, sounds broken glass. “What number cucumber-frames must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder they will next! As pulling window, I wish _could!_ I am sure _I_ do not want stay longer!” She waited time without hearing anything more: last came rumbling little cartwheels, sound good many voices talking together: she made words: “Where is ladder?—Why, I had not bring one; Bill’s got other—Bill! fetch here, lad!—Here, put  them corner—No, tie  them together first—they do not reach half high enough yet—Oh! they will well enough; do not particular—Here, Bill! catch hold rope—Will roof bear?—Mind loose slate—Oh, it is coming down! Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, that?—It Bill, I fancy—Who is go chimney?—Nay, _I_ shall not! _You_ it!—_That_ I will not, then!—Bill’s go down—Here, Bill! master says you are go chimney!” “Oh! So Bill’s got come chimney, he?” said Alice herself. “Shy, seem put everything upon Bill! I would not Bill’s place good deal: fireplace narrow, sure; I _think_ I kick little!” She drew her foot far chimney she could, waited till she heard little animal (she could not guess sort was) scratching scrambling chimney close her: then, saying herself “This Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, waited see would happen next. The first thing she heard general chorus “There goes Bill!” Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, hedge!” silence, another confusion voices—“Hold his head—Brandy now—Do not choke him—How it, old fellow? What happened you? Tell us it!” Last came little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That is Bill,” thought Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I am better now—but I am deal flustered tell you—all I know is, something comes like Jack-in-the-box, I goes like sky-rocket!” “So did, old fellow!” said others. “We must burn house down!” said Rabbit’s voice; Alice called loud she could, “If do, I will set Dinah you!” There dead silence instantly, Alice thought herself, “I wonder _will_ next! If sense, they would take roof off.” After minute two, began moving again, Alice heard Rabbit say, “A barrowful do, begin with.” “A barrowful _what?_” thought Alice; she long doubt, next moment shower little pebbles came rattling window, hit her face. “I will put stop this,” she said herself, shouted out, “You would better again!” produced another dead silence. Alice noticed surprise pebbles turning little cakes lay floor, bright idea came her head. “If I eat one cakes,” she thought, “it is sure make _some_ change size; cannot possibly make larger, must make smaller, I suppose.” So she swallowed one cakes, delighted find she began shrinking directly. As soon she small enough get door, she ran house, found quite crowd little animals birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, middle, held two guinea-pigs, giving something bottle. They made rush Alice moment she appeared; she ran hard she could, soon found herself safe thick wood. “The first thing I have got do,” said Alice herself, she wandered wood, “is grow right size again; second thing find way lovely garden. I think best plan.” It sounded excellent plan, doubt, neatly simply arranged; difficulty was, she smallest idea set it; she peering anxiously among trees, little sharp bark her head made her look great hurry. An enormous puppy looking her large round eyes, feebly stretching one paw, trying touch her. “Poor little thing!” said Alice, coaxing tone, she tried hard whistle it; she terribly frightened time thought might hungry, case would likely eat her spite her coaxing. Hardly knowing she did, she picked little bit stick, held puppy; whereupon puppy jumped air feet once, yelp delight, rushed stick, made believe worry it; Alice dodged behind great thistle, keep herself run over; moment she appeared side, puppy made another rush stick, tumbled head heels hurry get hold it; Alice, thinking like game play cart-horse, expecting every moment trampled feet, ran round thistle again; puppy began series short charges stick, running little way forwards time long way back, barking hoarsely while, till last sat good way off, panting, tongue hanging mouth, great eyes half shut. This seemed Alice good opportunity making her escape; she set once, ran till she quite tired breath, till puppy’s bark sounded quite faint distance. “And yet dear little puppy was!” said Alice, she leant buttercup rest herself, fanned herself one leaves: “I liked teaching tricks much, if—if I would right size it! Oh dear! I would nearly forgotten I have got grow again! Let see—how _is_ managed? I suppose I ought eat drink something other; great question is, what?” The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked round her flowers blades grass, she see anything looked like right thing eat drink circumstances. There large mushroom growing near her, height herself; she looked it, sides it, behind it, occurred her she might well look see top it. She stretched herself tiptoe, peeped edge mushroom, her eyes immediately met large blue caterpillar, sitting top arms folded, quietly smoking long hookah, taking smallest notice her anything else. CHAPTER V. Advice Caterpillar The Caterpillar Alice looked time silence: last Caterpillar took hookah mouth, addressed her languid, sleepy voice. “Who _you?_” said Caterpillar. This encouraging opening conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, present—at least I know I _was_ I got morning, I think I must changed several times since then.” “What mean that?” said Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!” “I cannot explain _myself_, I am afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I am myself, see.” “I do not see,” said Caterpillar. “I am afraid I cannot put clearly,” Alice replied politely, “for I cannot understand begin with; many different sizes day confusing.” “It is not,” said Caterpillar. “Well, perhaps have not found yet,” said Alice; “but turn chrysalis—you day, know—and butterfly, I think you will feel little queer, will not you?” “Not bit,” said Caterpillar. “Well, perhaps feelings may different,” said Alice; “all I know is, would feel queer _me_.” “You!” said Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who _you?_” Which brought back beginning conversation. Alice felt little irritated Caterpillar’s making _very_ short remarks, she drew herself said, gravely, “I think, ought tell _you_ are, first.” “Why?” said Caterpillar. Here another puzzling question; Alice could think good reason, Caterpillar seemed _very_ unpleasant state mind, she turned away. “Come back!” Caterpillar called her. “I have something important say!” This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned came back again. “Keep temper,” said Caterpillar. “Is all?” said Alice, swallowing her anger well she could. “No,” said Caterpillar. Alice thought she might well wait, she nothing else do, perhaps might tell her something worth hearing. For minutes puffed away without speaking, last unfolded arms, took hookah mouth again, said, “So think you are changed, you?” “I am afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I cannot remember things I used—and I do not keep size ten minutes together!” “Cannot remember _what_ things?” said Caterpillar. “Well, I have tried say “How doth little busy bee,” came different!” Alice replied melancholy voice. “Repeat, “_You old, Father William_,’” said Caterpillar. Alice folded her hands, began:— “You old, Father William,” young man said, “And hair become white; And yet incessantly stand head— Do think, age, right?” “In youth,” Father William replied his son, “I feared might injure brain; But, I am perfectly sure I none, Why, I again.” “You old,” said youth, “as I mentioned before, And grown uncommonly fat; Yet turned back-somersault door— Pray, reason that?” “In youth,” said sage, he shook his grey locks, “I kept limbs supple By use ointment—one shilling box— Allow sell couple?” “You old,” said youth, “and jaws weak For anything tougher suet; Yet finished goose, bones beak— Pray, manage it?” “In youth,” said his father, “I took law, And argued case wife; And muscular strength, gave jaw, Has lasted rest life.” “You old,” said youth, “one would hardly suppose That eye steady ever; Yet balanced eel end nose— What made awfully clever?” “I answered three questions, enough,” Said his father; “do not give airs! Do think I listen day stuff? Be off, I will kick stairs!” “That said right,” said Caterpillar. “Not _quite_ right, I am afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some words got altered.” “It wrong beginning end,” said Caterpillar decidedly, silence minutes. The Caterpillar first speak. “What size want be?” asked. “Oh, I am particular size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one does not like changing often, know.” “I _don’t_ know,” said Caterpillar. Alice said nothing: she never much contradicted her life before, she felt she losing her temper. “Are content now?” said Caterpillar. “Well, I like _little_ larger, sir, would not mind,” said Alice: “three inches wretched height be.” “It good height indeed!” said Caterpillar angrily, rearing upright spoke (it exactly three inches high). “But I am used it!” pleaded poor Alice piteous tone. And she thought herself, “I wish creatures would not easily offended!” “You will get used time,” said Caterpillar; put hookah mouth began smoking again. This time Alice waited patiently chose speak again. In minute two Caterpillar took hookah mouth yawned twice, shook itself. Then got mushroom, crawled away grass, merely remarking went, “One side make grow taller, side make grow shorter.” “One side _what?_ The side _what?_” thought Alice herself. “Of mushroom,” said Caterpillar, she asked aloud; another moment sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully mushroom minute, trying make two sides it; perfectly round, she found difficult question. However, last she stretched her arms round far would go, broke bit edge hand. “And which?” she said herself, nibbled little right-hand bit try effect: next moment she felt violent blow underneath her chin: struck her foot! She good deal frightened sudden change, she felt time lost, she shrinking rapidly; she set work eat bit. Her chin pressed closely her foot, hardly room open her mouth; she last, managed swallow morsel lefthand bit. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * “Come, head’s free last!” said Alice tone delight, changed alarm another moment, she found her shoulders nowhere found: she could see, she looked down, immense length neck, seemed rise like stalk sea green leaves lay far her. “What _can_ green stuff be?” said Alice. “And _have_ shoulders got to? And oh, poor hands, I cannot see you?” She moving she spoke, result seemed follow, except little shaking among distant green leaves. As seemed chance getting her hands her head, she tried get her head them, delighted find her neck would bend easily direction, like serpent. She succeeded curving graceful zigzag, going dive among leaves, she found nothing tops trees she wandering, sharp hiss made her draw back hurry: large pigeon flown her face, beating her violently wings. “Serpent!” screamed Pigeon. “I am _not_ serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let alone!” “Serpent, I say again!” repeated Pigeon, subdued tone, added kind sob, “I have tried every way, nothing seems suit them!” “I have not least idea you are talking about,” said Alice. “I have tried roots trees, I have tried banks, I have tried hedges,” Pigeon went on, without attending her; “but serpents! There is pleasing them!” Alice puzzled, she thought use saying anything till Pigeon finished. “As was not trouble enough hatching eggs,” said Pigeon; “but I must look-out serpents night day! Why, I have not wink sleep three weeks!” “I am sorry you have annoyed,” said Alice, beginning see meaning. “And I would taken highest tree wood,” continued Pigeon, raising voice shriek, “and I thinking I free last, must needs come wriggling sky! Ugh, Serpent!” “But I am _not_ serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I am a—I am a—” “Well! _What_ you?” said Pigeon. “I see you are trying invent something!” “I—I am little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, she remembered number changes she gone day. “A likely story indeed!” said Pigeon tone deepest contempt. “I have seen good many little girls time, never _one_ neck that! No, no! You are serpent; there is use denying it. I suppose you will telling next never tasted egg!” “I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, truthful child; “but little girls eat eggs quite much serpents do, know.” “I do not believe it,” said Pigeon; “but do, they are kind serpent, that is I say.” This new idea Alice, she quite silent minute two, gave Pigeon opportunity adding, “You are looking eggs, I know _that_ well enough; matter whether you are little girl serpent?” “It matters good deal _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I am looking eggs, happens; I was, I should not want _yours_: I do not like raw.” “Well, off, then!” said Pigeon sulky tone, settled nest. Alice crouched among trees well she could, her neck kept getting entangled among branches, every she stop untwist it. After she remembered she still held pieces mushroom her hands, she set work carefully, nibbling first one other, growing sometimes taller sometimes shorter, she succeeded bringing herself her usual height. It long since she anything near right size, felt quite strange first; she got used minutes, began talking herself, usual. “Come, there is half plan done now! How puzzling changes are! I am never sure I am going be, one minute another! However, I have got back right size: next thing is, get beautiful garden—how _is_ done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon open place, little house four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it will never come upon _this_ size: why, I frighten wits!” So she began nibbling righthand bit again, venture go near house till she brought herself nine inches high. CHAPTER VI. Pig Pepper For minute two she stood looking house, wondering next, suddenly footman livery came running wood—(she considered footman he livery: otherwise, judging his face only, she would called fish)—and rapped loudly door his knuckles. It opened another footman livery, round face, large eyes like frog; footmen, Alice noticed, powdered hair curled heads. She felt curious know about, crept little way wood listen. The Fish-Footman began producing his arm great letter, nearly large himself, he handed other, saying, solemn tone, “For Duchess. An invitation Queen play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, solemn tone, changing order words little, “From Queen. An invitation Duchess play croquet.” Then bowed low, curls got entangled together. Alice laughed much this, she run back wood fear hearing her; she next peeped Fish-Footman gone, sitting ground near door, staring stupidly sky. Alice went timidly door, knocked. “There is sort use knocking,” said Footman, “and two reasons. First, I am side door are; secondly, they are making noise inside, one could possibly hear you.” And certainly _was_ extraordinary noise going within—a constant howling sneezing, every great crash, dish kettle broken pieces. “Please, then,” said Alice, “how I get in?” “There might sense knocking,” Footman went without attending her, “if door us. For instance, _inside_, might knock, I could let out, know.” He looking sky time he speaking, Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he cannot help it,” she said herself; “his eyes _very_ nearly top his head. But rate he might answer questions.—How I get in?” she repeated, aloud. “I shall sit here,” Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—” At moment door house opened, large plate came skimming out, straight Footman’s head: grazed his nose, broke pieces one trees behind him. “—or next day, maybe,” Footman continued tone, exactly nothing happened. “How I get in?” asked Alice again, louder tone. “_Are_ get all?” said Footman. “That is first question, know.” It was, doubt: Alice like told so. “It is really dreadful,” she muttered herself, “the way creatures argue. It is enough drive one crazy!” The Footman seemed think good opportunity repeating his remark, variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on off, days days.” “But _I_ do?” said Alice. “Anything like,” said Footman, began whistling. “Oh, there is use talking him,” said Alice desperately: “he is perfectly idiotic!” And she opened door went in. The door led right large kitchen, full smoke one end other: Duchess sitting three-legged stool middle, nursing baby; cook leaning fire, stirring large cauldron seemed full soup. “There is certainly much pepper soup!” Alice said herself, well she could sneezing. There certainly much air. Even Duchess sneezed occasionally; baby, sneezing howling alternately without moment’s pause. The things kitchen sneeze, cook, large cat sitting hearth grinning ear ear. “Please would tell me,” said Alice, little timidly, she quite sure whether good manners her speak first, “why cat grins like that?” “It is Cheshire cat,” said Duchess, “and that is why. Pig!” She said last word sudden violence Alice quite jumped; she saw another moment addressed baby, her, she took courage, went again:— “I did not know Cheshire cats always grinned; fact, I did not know cats _could_ grin.” “They can,” said Duchess; “and  them do.” “I do not know do,” Alice said politely, feeling quite pleased got conversation. “You do not know much,” said Duchess; “and that is fact.” Alice like tone remark, thought would well introduce subject conversation. While she trying fix one, cook took cauldron soup fire, set work throwing everything within her reach Duchess baby—the fire-irons came first; followed shower saucepans, plates, dishes. The Duchess took notice even hit her; baby howling much already, quite impossible say whether blows hurt not. “Oh, _please_ mind you are doing!” cried Alice, jumping agony terror. “Oh, goes his _precious_ nose!” unusually large saucepan flew close it, nearly carried off. “If everybody minded business,” Duchess said hoarse growl, “the world would go round deal faster does.” “Which would _not_ advantage,” said Alice, felt glad get opportunity showing little her knowledge. “Just think work would make day night! You see earth takes twenty-four hours turn round axis—” “Talking axes,” said Duchess, “chop her head!” Alice glanced rather anxiously cook, see she meant take hint; cook busily stirring soup, seemed listening, she went again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; twelve? I—” “Oh, do not bother _me_,” said Duchess; “I never could abide figures!” And she began nursing her child again, singing sort lullaby she so, giving violent shake end every line: “Speak roughly little boy, And beat he sneezes: He annoy, Because he knows teases.” CHORUS. (In cook baby joined): “Wow! wow! wow!” While Duchess sang second verse song, she kept tossing baby violently down, poor little thing howled so, Alice could hardly hear words:— “I speak severely boy, I beat he sneezes; For he thoroughly enjoy The pepper he pleases!” CHORUS. “Wow! wow! wow!” “Here! may nurse bit, like!” Duchess said Alice, flinging baby her she spoke. “I must go get ready play croquet Queen,” she hurried room. The cook threw frying-pan her she went out, missed her. Alice caught baby difficulty, queer-shaped little creature, held arms legs directions, “just like star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing snorting like steam-engine she caught it, kept doubling straightening again, altogether, first minute two, much she could hold it. As soon she made proper way nursing it, (which twist sort knot, keep tight hold right ear left foot, prevent undoing itself,) she carried open air. “If I do not take child away me,” thought Alice, “they are sure kill day two: would not murder leave behind?” She said last words loud, little thing grunted reply (it left sneezing time). “Do not grunt,” said Alice; “that is proper way expressing yourself.” The baby grunted again, Alice looked anxiously face see matter it. There could doubt _very_ turn-up nose, much like snout real nose; also eyes getting extremely small baby: altogether Alice like look thing all. “But perhaps sobbing,” she thought, looked eyes again, see tears. No, tears. “If you are going turn pig, dear,” said Alice, seriously, “I will nothing you. Mind now!” The poor little thing sobbed (or grunted, impossible say which), went silence. Alice beginning think herself, “Now, I creature I get home?” grunted again, violently, she looked face alarm. This time could _no_ mistake it: neither less pig, she felt would quite absurd her carry further. So she set little creature down, felt quite relieved see trot away quietly wood. “If grown up,” she said herself, “it would made dreadfully ugly child: makes rather handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking children she knew, might well pigs, saying herself, “if one knew right way change them—” she little startled seeing Cheshire Cat sitting bough tree yards off. The Cat grinned saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still _very_ long claws great many teeth, she felt ought treated respect. “Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, she know whether would like name: however, grinned little wider. “Come, it is pleased far,” thought Alice, she went on. “Would tell me, please, way I ought go here?” “That depends good deal want get to,” said Cat. “I do not much care where—” said Alice. “Then does not matter way go,” said Cat. “—so long I get _somewhere_,” Alice added explanation. “Oh, you are sure that,” said Cat, “if walk long enough.” Alice felt could denied, she tried another question. “What sort people live here?” “In _that_ direction,” Cat said, waving right paw round, “lives Hatter: _that_ direction,” waving paw, “lives March Hare. Visit either like: they are mad.” “But I do not want go among mad people,” Alice remarked. “Oh, cannot help that,” said Cat: “we are mad here. I am mad. You are mad.” “How know I am mad?” said Alice. “You must be,” said Cat, “or would not come here.” Alice did not think proved all; however, she went “And know you are mad?” “To begin with,” said Cat, “a dog’s mad. You grant that?” “I suppose so,” said Alice. “Well, then,” Cat went on, “you see, dog growls it is angry, wags tail it is pleased. Now _I_ growl I am pleased, wag tail I am angry. Therefore I am mad.” “_I_ call purring, growling,” said Alice. “Call like,” said Cat. “Do play croquet Queen to-day?” “I like much,” said Alice, “but I have not invited yet.” “You will see there,” said Cat, vanished. Alice much surprised this, she getting used queer things happening. While she looking place been, suddenly appeared again. “By-the-bye, became baby?” said Cat. “I would nearly forgotten ask.” “It turned pig,” Alice quietly said, come back natural way. “I thought would,” said Cat, vanished again. Alice waited little, half expecting see again, appear, minute two she walked direction March Hare said live. “I have seen hatters before,” she said herself; “the March Hare much interesting, perhaps May will not raving mad—at least mad March.” As she said this, she looked up, Cat again, sitting branch tree. “Did say pig, fig?” said Cat. “I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish would not keep appearing vanishing suddenly: make one quite giddy.” “All right,” said Cat; time vanished quite slowly, beginning end tail, ending grin, remained time rest gone. “Well! I have often seen cat without grin,” thought Alice; “but grin without cat! It is curious thing I ever saw life!” She gone much farther she came sight house March Hare: she thought must right house, chimneys shaped like ears roof thatched fur. It large house, she like go nearer till she nibbled lefthand bit mushroom, raised herself two feet high: even she walked towards rather timidly, saying herself “Suppose raving mad all! I almost wish I would gone see Hatter instead!” CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party There table set tree front house, March Hare Hatter tea it: Dormouse sitting them, fast asleep, two using cushion, resting elbows it, talking head. “Very uncomfortable Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, it is asleep, I suppose does not mind.” The table large one, three crowded together one corner it: “No room! No room!” cried saw Alice coming. “There is _plenty_ room!” said Alice indignantly, she sat large arm-chair one end table. “Have wine,” March Hare said encouraging tone. Alice looked round table, nothing tea. “I do not see wine,” she remarked. “There is not any,” said March Hare. “Then was not civil offer it,” said Alice angrily. “It was not civil sit without invited,” said March Hare. “I did not know _your_ table,” said Alice; “it is laid great many three.” “Your hair wants cutting,” said Hatter. He looking Alice time great curiosity, his first speech. “You learn make personal remarks,” Alice said severity; “it is rude.” The Hatter opened his eyes wide hearing this; he _said_ was, “Why raven like writing-desk?” “Come, shall fun now!” thought Alice. “I am glad they have begun asking riddles.—I believe I guess that,” she added aloud. “Do mean think find answer it?” said March Hare. “Exactly so,” said Alice. “Then say mean,” March Hare went on. “I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean I say—that is thing, know.” “Not thing bit!” said Hatter. “You might well say ‘I see I eat’ thing ‘I eat I see’!” “You might well say,” added March Hare, “that ‘I like I get’ thing ‘I get I like’!” “You might well say,” added Dormouse, seemed talking his sleep, “that ‘I breathe I sleep’ thing ‘I sleep I breathe’!” “It _is_ thing you,” said Hatter, conversation dropped, party sat silent minute, Alice thought she could remember ravens writing-desks, was not much. The Hatter first break silence. “What day month it?” he said, turning Alice: he taken his watch his pocket, looking uneasily, shaking every then, holding his ear. Alice considered little, said “The fourth.” “Two days wrong!” sighed Hatter. “I told butter would not suit works!” he added looking angrily March Hare. “It _best_ butter,” March Hare meekly replied. “Yes, crumbs must got well,” Hatter grumbled: “you should not put bread-knife.” The March Hare took watch looked gloomily: he dipped his cup tea, looked again: he could think nothing better say his first remark, “It _best_ butter, know.” Alice looking his shoulder curiosity. “What funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells day month, does not tell of the clock is!” “Why it?” muttered Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell year is?” “Of course not,” Alice replied readily: “but that is stays year long time together.” “Which case _mine_,” said Hatter. Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed sort meaning it, yet certainly English. “I do not quite understand you,” she said, politely she could. “The Dormouse asleep again,” said Hatter, he poured little hot tea upon nose. The Dormouse shook head impatiently, said, without opening eyes, “Of course, course; I going remark myself.” “Have guessed riddle yet?” Hatter said, turning Alice again. “No, I give up,” Alice replied: “what is answer?” “I have not slightest idea,” said Hatter. “Nor I,” said March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. “I think might something better time,” she said, “than waste asking riddles answers.” “If knew Time well I do,” said Hatter, “you would not talk wasting _it_. It is _him_.” “I do not know mean,” said Alice. “Of course do not!” Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. “I dare say never even spoke Time!” “Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I beat time I learn music.” “Ah! accounts it,” said Hatter. “He will not stand beating. Now, kept good terms him, he would almost anything liked clock. For instance, suppose nine of the clock morning, time begin lessons: you would whisper hint Time, round goes clock twinkling! Half-past one, time dinner!” (“I wish was,” March Hare said whisper.) “That would grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I should not hungry it, know.” “Not first, perhaps,” said Hatter: “but could keep half-past one long liked.” “Is way _you_ manage?” Alice asked. The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We quarrelled last March—just _he_ went mad, know—” (pointing his tea spoon March Hare,) “—it great concert given Queen Hearts, I sing ‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder you are at!’ You know song, perhaps?” “I have heard something like it,” said Alice. “It goes on, know,” Hatter continued, “in way:— ‘Up world fly, Like tea-tray sky. Twinkle, twinkle—’” Here Dormouse shook itself, began singing sleep “_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” went long pinch make stop. “Well, I would hardly finished first verse,” said Hatter, “when Queen jumped bawled out, ‘He is murdering time! Off his head!’” “How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice. “And ever since that,” Hatter went mournful tone, “he will not thing I ask! It is always six of the clock now.” A bright idea came Alice’s head. “Is reason many tea-things put here?” she asked. “Yes, that is it,” said Hatter sigh: “it is always tea-time, we have time wash things whiles.” “Then keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice. “Exactly so,” said Hatter: “as things get used up.” “But happens come beginning again?” Alice ventured ask. “Suppose change subject,” March Hare interrupted, yawning. “I am getting tired this. I vote young lady tells us story.” “I am afraid I do not know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed proposal. “Then Dormouse shall!” cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And pinched sides once. The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I was not asleep,” he said hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word fellows saying.” “Tell us story!” said March Hare. “Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice. “And quick it,” added Hatter, “or you will asleep it is done.” “Once upon time three little sisters,” Dormouse began great hurry; “and names Elsie, Lacie, Tillie; lived bottom well—” “What live on?” said Alice, always took great interest questions eating drinking. “They lived treacle,” said Dormouse, thinking minute two. “They could not done that, know,” Alice gently remarked; “they would ill.” “So were,” said Dormouse; “_very_ ill.” Alice tried fancy herself extraordinary ways living would like, puzzled her much, she went on: “But live bottom well?” “Take tea,” March Hare said Alice, earnestly. “I have nothing yet,” Alice replied offended tone, “so I cannot take more.” “You mean cannot take _less_,” said Hatter: “it is easy take _more_ nothing.” “Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice. “Who is making personal remarks now?” Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice quite know say this: she helped herself tea bread-and-butter, turned Dormouse, repeated her question. “Why live bottom well?” The Dormouse took minute two think it, said, “It treacle-well.” “There is thing!” Alice beginning angrily, Hatter March Hare went “Sh! sh!” Dormouse sulkily remarked, “If cannot civil, you would better finish story yourself.” “No, please go on!” Alice said humbly; “I will not interrupt again. I dare say may _one_.” “One, indeed!” said Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented go on. “And three little sisters—they learning draw, know—” “What draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise. “Treacle,” said Dormouse, without considering time. “I want clean cup,” interrupted Hatter: “let us move one place on.” He moved he spoke, Dormouse followed him: March Hare moved Dormouse’s place, Alice rather unwillingly took place March Hare. The Hatter one got advantage change: Alice good deal worse before, March Hare upset milk-jug his plate. Alice wish offend Dormouse again, she began cautiously: “But I do not understand. Where draw treacle from?” “You draw water water-well,” said Hatter; “so I think could draw treacle treacle-well—eh, stupid?” “But _in_ well,” Alice said Dormouse, choosing notice last remark. “Of course were,” said Dormouse; “—well in.” This answer confused poor Alice, she let Dormouse go time without interrupting it. “They learning draw,” Dormouse went on, yawning rubbing eyes, getting sleepy; “and drew manner things—everything begins M—” “Why M?” said Alice. “Why not?” said March Hare. Alice silent. The Dormouse closed eyes time, going doze; but, pinched Hatter, woke little shriek, went on: “—that begins M, mouse-traps, moon, memory, muchness—you know say things “much muchness”—did ever see thing drawing muchness?” “Really, ask me,” said Alice, much confused, “I do not think—” “Then should not talk,” said Hatter. This piece rudeness Alice could bear: she got great disgust, walked off; Dormouse fell asleep instantly, neither others took least notice her going, though she looked back twice, half hoping would call her: last time she saw them, trying put Dormouse teapot. “At rate I will never go _there_ again!” said Alice she picked her way wood. “It is stupidest tea-party I ever life!” Just she said this, she noticed one trees door leading right it. “That is curious!” she thought. “But everything’s curious today. I think I may well go once.” And she went. Once she found herself long hall, close little glass table. “Now, I will manage better time,” she said herself, began taking little golden key, unlocking door led garden. Then she went work nibbling mushroom (she kept piece her pocket) till she foot high: she walked little passage: _then_—she found herself last beautiful garden, among bright flower-beds cool fountains. CHAPTER VIII. The Queen’s Croquet-Ground A large rose-tree stood near entrance garden: roses growing white, three gardeners it, busily painting red. Alice thought curious thing, she went nearer watch them, she came she heard one say, “Look now, Five! Do not go splashing paint like that!” “I could not help it,” said Five, sulky tone; “Seven jogged elbow.” On Seven looked said, “That is right, Five! Always lay blame others!” “_You’d_ better talk!” said Five. “I heard Queen say yesterday deserved beheaded!” “What for?” said one spoken first. “That is none _your_ business, Two!” said Seven. “Yes, _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I will tell him—it bringing cook tulip-roots instead onions.” Seven flung his brush, begun “Well, unjust things—” his eye chanced fall upon Alice, she stood watching them, he checked suddenly: others looked round also, bowed low. “Would tell me,” said Alice, little timidly, “why painting roses?” Five Seven said nothing, looked Two. Two began low voice, “Why fact is, see, Miss, ought _red_ rose-tree, put white one mistake; Queen find out, heads cut off, know. So see, Miss, we are best, afore she comes, to—” At moment Five, anxiously looking across garden, called “The Queen! The Queen!” three gardeners instantly threw flat upon faces. There sound many footsteps, Alice looked round, eager see Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; shaped like three gardeners, oblong flat, hands feet corners: next ten courtiers; ornamented diamonds, walked two two, soldiers did. After came royal children; ten them, little dears came jumping merrily along hand hand, couples: ornamented hearts. Next came guests, mostly Kings Queens, among Alice recognised White Rabbit: talking hurried nervous manner, smiling everything said, went without noticing her. Then followed Knave Hearts, carrying King’s crown crimson velvet cushion; and, last grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. Alice rather doubtful whether she ought lie her face like three gardeners, she could remember ever heard rule processions; “and besides, would use procession,” thought she, “if people lie upon faces, could not see it?” So she stood still she was, waited. When procession came opposite Alice, stopped looked her, Queen said severely “Who this?” She said Knave Hearts, bowed smiled reply. “Idiot!” said Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning Alice, she went on, “What is name, child?” “My name Alice, please Majesty,” said Alice politely; she added, herself, “Why, they are pack cards, all. I need not afraid them!” “And _these?_” said Queen, pointing three gardeners lying round rose-tree; for, see, lying faces, pattern backs rest pack, she could tell whether gardeners, soldiers, courtiers, three her children. “How _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised her courage. “It is business _mine_.” The Queen turned crimson fury, and, glaring her moment like wild beast, screamed “Off her head! Off—” “Nonsense!” said Alice, loudly decidedly, Queen silent. The King laid his hand upon her arm, timidly said “Consider, dear: she child!” The Queen turned angrily away him, said Knave “Turn over!” The Knave so, carefully, one foot. “Get up!” said Queen, shrill, loud voice, three gardeners instantly jumped up, began bowing King, Queen, royal children, everybody else. “Leave that!” screamed Queen. “You make giddy.” And then, turning rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ here?” “May please Majesty,” said Two, humble tone, going one knee he spoke, “we trying—” “_I_ see!” said Queen, meanwhile examining roses. “Off heads!” procession moved on, three soldiers remaining behind execute unfortunate gardeners, ran Alice protection. “You shall not beheaded!” said Alice, she put large flower-pot stood near. The three soldiers wandered minute two, looking them, quietly marched others. “Are heads off?” shouted Queen. “Their heads gone, please Majesty!” soldiers shouted reply. “That is right!” shouted Queen. “Can play croquet?” The soldiers silent, looked Alice, question evidently meant her. “Yes!” shouted Alice. “Come on, then!” roared Queen, Alice joined procession, wondering much would happen next. “It is—it is fine day!” said timid voice her side. She walking White Rabbit, peeping anxiously her face. “Very,” said Alice: “—where is Duchess?” “Hush! Hush!” said Rabbit low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously his shoulder he spoke, raised upon tiptoe, put his mouth close her ear, whispered “She is sentence execution.” “What for?” said Alice. “Did say ‘What pity!’?” Rabbit asked. “No, I did not,” said Alice: “I do not think it is pity. I said ‘What for?’” “She boxed Queen’s ears—” Rabbit began. Alice gave little scream laughter. “Oh, hush!” Rabbit whispered frightened tone. “The Queen hear you! You see, she came rather late, Queen said—” “Get places!” shouted Queen voice thunder, people began running directions, tumbling other; however, got settled minute two, game began. Alice thought she never seen curious croquet-ground her life; ridges furrows; balls live hedgehogs, mallets live flamingoes, soldiers double stand hands feet, make arches. The chief difficulty Alice found first managing her flamingo: she succeeded getting body tucked away, comfortably enough, her arm, legs hanging down, generally, she got neck nicely straightened out, going give hedgehog blow head, _would_ twist round look her face, puzzled expression she could help bursting laughing: she got head down, going begin again, provoking find hedgehog unrolled itself, act crawling away: besides this, generally ridge furrow way wherever she wanted send hedgehog to, and, doubled-up soldiers always getting walking parts ground, Alice soon came conclusion difficult game indeed. The players played without waiting turns, quarrelling while, fighting hedgehogs; short time Queen furious passion, went stamping about, shouting “Off his head!” “Off her head!” minute. Alice began feel uneasy: sure, she yet dispute Queen, she knew might happen minute, “and then,” thought she, “what would become me? They are dreadfully fond beheading people here; great wonder is, there is one left alive!” She looking way escape, wondering whether she could get away without seen, she noticed curious appearance air: puzzled her much first, but, watching minute two, she made grin, she said herself “It is Cheshire Cat: I shall somebody talk to.” “How getting on?” said Cat, soon mouth enough speak with. Alice waited till eyes appeared, nodded. “It is use speaking it,” she thought, “till ears come, least one them.” In another minute whole head appeared, Alice put her flamingo, began account game, feeling glad she someone listen her. The Cat seemed think enough sight, appeared. “I do not think play fairly,” Alice began, rather complaining tone, “and quarrel dreadfully one cannot hear oneself speak—and do not seem rules particular; least, are, nobody attends them—and you have idea confusing things alive; instance, there is arch I have got go next walking end ground—and I croqueted Queen’s hedgehog now, ran away saw mine coming!” “How like Queen?” said Cat low voice. “Not all,” said Alice: “she is extremely—” Just she noticed Queen close behind her, listening: she went on, “—likely win, it is hardly worth finishing game.” The Queen smiled passed on. “Who _are_ talking to?” said King, going Alice, looking Cat’s head great curiosity. “It is friend mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow introduce it.” “I do not like look all,” said King: “however, may kiss hand likes.” “I would rather not,” Cat remarked. “Do not impertinent,” said King, “and do not look like that!” He got behind Alice he spoke. “A cat may look king,” said Alice. “I have read book, I do not remember where.” “Well, must removed,” said King decidedly, he called Queen, passing moment, “My dear! I wish would cat removed!” The Queen one way settling difficulties, great small. “Off his head!” she said, without even looking round. “I will fetch executioner myself,” said King eagerly, he hurried off. Alice thought she might well go back, see game going on, she heard Queen’s voice distance, screaming passion. She already heard her sentence three players executed missed turns, she like look things all, game confusion she never knew whether her turn not. So she went search her hedgehog. The hedgehog engaged fight another hedgehog, seemed Alice excellent opportunity croqueting one other: difficulty was, her flamingo gone across side garden, Alice could see trying helpless sort way fly tree. By time she caught flamingo brought back, fight over, hedgehogs sight: “but does not matter much,” thought Alice, “as arches gone side ground.” So she tucked away her arm, might escape again, went back little conversation her friend. When she got back Cheshire Cat, she surprised find quite large crowd collected round it: dispute going executioner, King, Queen, talking once, rest quite silent, looked uncomfortable. The moment Alice appeared, she appealed three settle question, repeated arguments her, though, spoke once, she found hard indeed make exactly said. The executioner’s argument was, could not cut head unless body cut from: he never thing before, he was not going begin _his_ time life. The King’s argument was, anything head could beheaded, were not talk nonsense. The Queen’s argument was, something was not done less time she would everybody executed, round. (It last remark made whole party look grave anxious.) Alice could think nothing else say “It belongs Duchess: you would better ask _her_ it.” “She is prison,” Queen said executioner: “fetch her here.” And executioner went like arrow. The Cat’s head began fading away moment he gone, and, time he come back Duchess, entirely disappeared; King executioner ran wildly looking it, rest party went back game. CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle’s Story “You cannot think glad I see again, dear old thing!” said Duchess, she tucked her arm affectionately Alice’s, walked together. Alice glad find her pleasant temper, thought herself perhaps pepper made her savage met kitchen. “When _I’m_ Duchess,” she said herself, (not hopeful tone though), “I will not pepper kitchen _at all_. Soup well without—Maybe it is always pepper makes people hot-tempered,” she went on, much pleased found new kind rule, “and vinegar makes sour—and camomile makes bitter—and—and barley-sugar things make children sweet-tempered. I wish people knew _that_: would not stingy it, know—” She quite forgotten Duchess time, little startled she heard her voice close her ear. “You are thinking something, dear, makes forget talk. I cannot tell moral is, I shall remember bit.” “Perhaps has not one,” Alice ventured remark. “Tut, tut, child!” said Duchess. “Everything’s got moral, find it.” And she squeezed herself closer Alice’s side she spoke. Alice much like keeping close her: first, Duchess _very_ ugly; secondly, she exactly right height rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she like rude, she bore well she could. “The game’s going rather better now,” she said, way keeping conversation little. “It Is so,” said Duchess: “and moral is—‘Oh, it is love, it is love, makes world go round!’” “Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it is done everybody minding business!” “Ah, well! It means much thing,” said Duchess, digging her sharp little chin Alice’s shoulder she added, “and moral _that_ is—‘Take care sense, sounds take care themselves.’” “How fond she finding morals things!” Alice thought herself. “I dare say you are wondering I do not put arm round waist,” Duchess said pause: “the reason is, I am doubtful temper flamingo. Shall I try experiment?” “He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, feeling anxious experiment tried. “Very true,” said Duchess: “flamingoes mustard bite. And moral is—‘Birds feather flock together.’” “Only mustard is not bird,” Alice remarked. “Right, usual,” said Duchess: “what clear way putting things!” “It is mineral, I _think_,” said Alice. “Of course is,” said Duchess, seemed ready agree everything Alice said; “there is large mustard-mine near here. And moral is—‘The mine, less yours.’” “Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, attended last remark, “it is vegetable. It does not look like one, is.” “I quite agree you,” said Duchess; “and moral is—‘Be would seem be’—or you would like put simply—‘Never imagine otherwise might appear others might otherwise would appeared otherwise.’” “I think I understand better,” Alice said politely, “if I written down: I cannot quite follow say it.” “That is nothing I could say I chose,” Duchess replied, pleased tone. “Pray do not trouble say longer that,” said Alice. “Oh, do not talk trouble!” said Duchess. “I make present everything I have said yet.” “A cheap sort present!” thought Alice. “I am glad do not give birthday presents like that!” But she venture say loud. “Thinking again?” Duchess asked, another dig her sharp little chin. “I have right think,” said Alice sharply, she beginning feel little worried. “Just much right,” said Duchess, “as pigs fly; m—” But here, Alice’s great surprise, Duchess’s voice died away, even middle her favourite word ‘moral,’ arm linked began tremble. Alice looked up, stood Queen front them, her arms folded, frowning like thunderstorm. “A fine day, Majesty!” Duchess began low, weak voice. “Now, I give fair warning,” shouted Queen, stamping ground she spoke; “either head must off, half time! Take choice!” The Duchess took her choice, gone moment. “Let us go game,” Queen said Alice; Alice much frightened say word, slowly followed her back croquet-ground. The guests taken advantage Queen’s absence, resting shade: however, moment saw her, hurried back game, Queen merely remarking moment’s delay would cost lives. All time playing Queen never left quarrelling players, shouting “Off his head!” “Off her head!” Those she sentenced taken custody soldiers, course leave arches this, end half hour arches left, players, except King, Queen, Alice, custody sentence execution. Then Queen left off, quite breath, said Alice, “Have seen Mock Turtle yet?” “No,” said Alice. “I do not even know Mock Turtle is.” “It is thing Mock Turtle Soup made from,” said Queen. “I never saw one, heard one,” said Alice. “Come on, then,” said Queen, “and he shall tell his history,” As walked together, Alice heard King say low voice, company generally, “You pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ good thing!” she said herself, she felt quite unhappy number executions Queen ordered. They soon came upon Gryphon, lying fast asleep sun. (If do not know Gryphon is, look picture.) “Up, lazy thing!” said Queen, “and take young lady see Mock Turtle, hear his history. I must go back see executions I ordered;” she walked off, leaving Alice alone Gryphon. Alice quite like look creature, whole she thought would quite safe stay go savage Queen: she waited. The Gryphon sat rubbed eyes: watched Queen till she sight: chuckled. “What fun!” said Gryphon, half itself, half Alice. “What _is_ fun?” said Alice. “Why, _she_,” said Gryphon. “It is her fancy, that: never executes nobody, know. Come on!” “Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, she went slowly it: “I never ordered life, never!” They gone far saw Mock Turtle distance, sitting sad lonely little ledge rock, and, came nearer, Alice could hear sighing his heart would break. She pitied deeply. “What his sorrow?” she asked Gryphon, Gryphon answered, nearly words before, “It is his fancy, that: he has not got sorrow, know. Come on!” So went Mock Turtle, looked large eyes full tears, said nothing. “This young lady,” said Gryphon, “she wants know history, she do.” “I will tell her,” said Mock Turtle deep, hollow tone: “sit down, you, do not speak word till I have finished.” So sat down, nobody spoke minutes. Alice thought herself, “I do not see he _ever_ finish, he does not begin.” But she waited patiently. “Once,” said Mock Turtle last, deep sigh, “I real Turtle.” These words followed long silence, broken occasional exclamation “Hjckrrh!” Gryphon, constant heavy sobbing Mock Turtle. Alice nearly getting saying, “Thank you, sir, interesting story,” she could help thinking _must_ come, she sat still said nothing. “When little,” Mock Turtle went last, calmly, though still sobbing little then, “we went school sea. The master old Turtle—we used call Tortoise—” “Why call Tortoise, he was not one?” Alice asked. “We called Tortoise he taught us,” said Mock Turtle angrily: “really dull!” “You ought ashamed asking simple question,” added Gryphon; sat silent looked poor Alice, felt ready sink earth. At last Gryphon said Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Do not day it!” he went words: “Yes, went school sea, though may not believe it—” “I never said I did not!” interrupted Alice. “You did,” said Mock Turtle. “Hold tongue!” added Gryphon, Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on. “We best educations—in fact, went school every day—” “_I’ve_ day-school, too,” said Alice; “you need not proud that.” “With extras?” asked Mock Turtle little anxiously. “Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French music.” “And washing?” said Mock Turtle. “Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly. “Ah! was not really good school,” said Mock Turtle tone great relief. “Now _ours_ end bill, ‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’” “You could not wanted much,” said Alice; “living bottom sea.” “I could not afford learn it.” said Mock Turtle sigh. “I took regular course.” “What that?” inquired Alice. “Reeling Writhing, course, begin with,” Mock Turtle replied; “and different branches Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, Derision.” “I never heard ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured say. “What it?” The Gryphon lifted paws surprise. “What! Never heard uglifying!” exclaimed. “You know beautify is, I suppose?” “Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.” “Well, then,” Gryphon went on, “if do not know uglify is, _are_ simpleton.” Alice feel encouraged ask questions it, she turned Mock Turtle, said “What else learn?” “Well, Mystery,” Mock Turtle replied, counting subjects his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient modern, Seaography: Drawling—the Drawling-master old conger-eel, used come week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, Fainting Coils.” “What _that_ like?” said Alice. “Well, I cannot show myself,” Mock Turtle said: “I am stiff. And Gryphon never learnt it.” “Had not time,” said Gryphon: “I went Classics master, though. He old crab, _he_ was.” “I never went him,” Mock Turtle said sigh: “he taught Laughing Grief, used say.” “So he did, he did,” said Gryphon, sighing his turn; creatures hid faces paws. “And many hours day lessons?” said Alice, hurry change subject. “Ten hours first day,” said Mock Turtle: “nine next, on.” “What curious plan!” exclaimed Alice. “That is reason they are called lessons,” Gryphon remarked: “because lessen day day.” This quite new idea Alice, she thought little she made her next remark. “Then eleventh day must holiday?” “Of course was,” said Mock Turtle. “And manage twelfth?” Alice went eagerly. “That is enough lessons,” Gryphon interrupted decided tone: “tell her something games now.” CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, drew back one flapper across his eyes. He looked Alice, tried speak, minute two sobs choked his voice. “Same he bone his throat,” said Gryphon: set work shaking punching back. At last Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, tears running his cheeks, he went again:— “You may lived much sea—” (“I have not,” said Alice)—“and perhaps never even introduced lobster—” (Alice began say “I tasted—” checked herself hastily, said “No, never”) “—so idea delightful thing Lobster Quadrille is!” “No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort dance it?” “Why,” said Gryphon, “you first form line along sea-shore—” “Two lines!” cried Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, on; then, you have cleared jelly-fish way—” “_That_ generally takes time,” interrupted Gryphon. “—you advance twice—” “Each lobster partner!” cried Gryphon. “Of course,” Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set partners—” “—change lobsters, retire order,” continued Gryphon. “Then, know,” Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—” “The lobsters!” shouted Gryphon, bound air. “—as far sea can—” “Swim them!” screamed Gryphon. “Turn somersault sea!” cried Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. “Change lobsters again!” yelled Gryphon top voice. “Back land again, that is first figure,” said Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; two creatures, jumping like mad things time, sat sadly quietly, looked Alice. “It must pretty dance,” said Alice timidly. “Would like see little it?” said Mock Turtle. “Very much indeed,” said Alice. “Come, let us try first figure!” said Mock Turtle Gryphon. “We without lobsters, know. Which shall sing?” “Oh, _you_ sing,” said Gryphon. “I have forgotten words.” So began solemnly dancing round round Alice, every treading her toes passed close, waving forepaws mark time, Mock Turtle sang this, slowly sadly:— “Will walk little faster?” said whiting snail. “There is porpoise close behind us, he is treading tail. See eagerly lobsters turtles advance! They waiting shingle—will come join dance? Will you, will not you, you, will not you, join dance? Will you, will not you, you, will not you, will not join dance? “You really notion delightful When take us throw us, lobsters, sea!” But snail replied “Too far, far!” gave look askance— Said he thanked whiting kindly, he would join dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would join dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could join dance. “What matters far go?” his scaly friend replied. “There another shore, know, upon side. The England nearer France— Then turn pale, beloved snail, come join dance. Will you, will not you, you, will not you, join dance? Will you, will not you, you, will not you, will not join dance?” “Thank you, it is interesting dance watch,” said Alice, feeling glad last: “and I like curious song whiting!” “Oh, whiting,” said Mock Turtle, “they—you have seen them, course?” “Yes,” said Alice, “I have often seen dinn—” she checked herself hastily. “I do not know Dinn may be,” said Mock Turtle, “but you have seen often, course know they are like.” “I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They tails mouths—and they are crumbs.” “You are wrong crumbs,” said Mock Turtle: “crumbs would wash sea. But _have_ tails mouths; reason is—” Mock Turtle yawned shut his eyes.—“Tell her reason that,” he said Gryphon. “The reason is,” said Gryphon, “that _would_ go lobsters dance. So got thrown sea. So fall long way. So got tails fast mouths. So could not get again. That is all.” “Thank you,” said Alice, “it is interesting. I never knew much whiting before.” “I tell that, like,” said Gryphon. “Do know it is called whiting?” “I never thought it,” said Alice. “Why?” “_It boots shoes_,” Gryphon replied solemnly. Alice thoroughly puzzled. “Does boots shoes!” she repeated wondering tone. “Why, _your_ shoes done with?” said Gryphon. “I mean, makes shiny?” Alice looked them, considered little she gave her answer. “They are done blacking, I believe.” “Boots shoes sea,” Gryphon went deep voice, “are done whiting. Now know.” “And made of?” Alice asked tone great curiosity. “Soles eels, course,” Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp could told that.” “If I would whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts still running song, “I would said porpoise, ‘Keep back, please: do not want _you_ us!’” “They obliged them,” Mock Turtle said: “no wise fish would go anywhere without porpoise.” “Would not really?” said Alice tone great surprise. “Of course not,” said Mock Turtle: “why, fish came _me_, told he going journey, I say ‘With porpoise?’” “Do not mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice. “I mean I say,” Mock Turtle replied offended tone. And Gryphon added “Come, let us hear _your_ adventures.” “I could tell adventures—beginning morning,” said Alice little timidly: “but it is use going back yesterday, I different person then.” “Explain that,” said Mock Turtle. “No, no! The adventures first,” said Gryphon impatient tone: “explanations take dreadful time.” So Alice began telling her adventures time she first saw White Rabbit. She little nervous first, two creatures got close her, one side, opened eyes mouths _very_ wide, she gained courage she went on. Her listeners perfectly quiet till she got part her repeating “_You old, Father William_,” Caterpillar, words coming different, Mock Turtle drew long breath, said “That is curious.” “It is curious be,” said Gryphon. “It came different!” Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I like hear her try repeat something now. Tell her begin.” He looked Gryphon he thought kind authority Alice. “Stand repeat ‘’_Tis voice sluggard_,’” said Gryphon. “How creatures order one about, make one repeat lessons!” thought Alice; “I might well school once.” However, she got up, began repeat it, her head full Lobster Quadrille, she hardly knew she saying, words came queer indeed:— “It Is voice Lobster; I heard declare, “You baked brown, I must sugar hair.” As duck eyelids, he his nose Trims his belt his buttons, turns his toes.” [later editions continued follows When sands dry, he gay lark, And talk contemptuous tones Shark, But, tide rises sharks around, His voice timid tremulous sound.] “That is different _I_ used say I child,” said Gryphon. “Well, I never heard before,” said Mock Turtle; “but sounds uncommon nonsense.” Alice said nothing; she sat her face her hands, wondering anything would _ever_ happen natural way again. “I like explained,” said Mock Turtle. “She cannot explain it,” said Gryphon hastily. “Go next verse.” “But his toes?” Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn his nose, know?” “It is first position dancing.” Alice said; dreadfully puzzled whole thing, longed change subject. “Go next verse,” Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it begins ‘_I passed his garden_.’” Alice dare disobey, though she felt sure would come wrong, she went trembling voice:— “I passed his garden, marked, one eye, How Owl Panther sharing pie—” [later editions continued follows The Panther took pie-crust, gravy, meat, While Owl dish share treat. When pie finished, Owl, boon, Was kindly permitted pocket spoon: While Panther received knife fork growl, And concluded banquet—] “What _is_ use repeating stuff,” Mock Turtle interrupted, “if do not explain go on? It is far confusing thing _I_ ever heard!” “Yes, I think you would better leave off,” said Gryphon: Alice glad so. “Shall try another figure Lobster Quadrille?” Gryphon went on. “Or would like Mock Turtle sing song?” “Oh, song, please, Mock Turtle would kind,” Alice replied, eagerly Gryphon said, rather offended tone, “Hm! No accounting tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ you, old fellow?” The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, began, voice sometimes choked sobs, sing this:— “Beautiful Soup, rich green, Waiting hot tureen! Who dainties would stoop? Soup evening, beautiful Soup! Soup evening, beautiful Soup! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop e—e—evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup! “Beautiful Soup! Who cares fish, Game, dish? Who would give else two p ennyworth beautiful Soup? Pennyworth beautiful Soup? Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop e—e—evening, Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!” “Chorus again!” cried Gryphon, Mock Turtle begun repeat it, cry “The trial’s beginning!” heard distance. “Come on!” cried Gryphon, and, taking Alice hand, hurried off, without waiting end song. “What trial it?” Alice panted she ran; Gryphon answered “Come on!” ran faster, faintly came, carried breeze followed them, melancholy words:— “Soo—oop e—e—evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!” CHAPTER XI. Who Stole Tarts? The King Queen Hearts seated throne arrived, great crowd assembled them—all sorts little birds beasts, well whole pack cards: Knave standing them, chains, soldier side guard him; near King White Rabbit, trumpet one hand, scroll parchment other. In middle court table, large dish tarts upon it: looked good, made Alice quite hungry look them—“I wish they would get trial done,” she thought, “and hand round refreshments!” But seemed chance this, she began looking everything her, pass away time. Alice never court justice before, she read books, she quite pleased find she knew name nearly everything there. “That is judge,” she said herself, “because his great wig.” The judge, way, King; he wore his crown wig, (look frontispiece want see he it,) he look comfortable, certainly becoming. “And that is jury-box,” thought Alice, “and twelve creatures,” (she obliged say “creatures,” see, animals, birds,) “I suppose jurors.” She said last word two three times herself, rather proud it: she thought, rightly too, little girls her age knew meaning all. However, “jury-men” would done well. The twelve jurors writing busily slates. “What doing?” Alice whispered Gryphon. “They cannot anything put yet, trial’s begun.” “They are putting names,” Gryphon whispered reply, “for fear forget end trial.” “Stupid things!” Alice began loud, indignant voice, she stopped hastily, White Rabbit cried out, “Silence court!” King put his spectacles looked anxiously round, make talking. Alice could see, well she looking shoulders, jurors writing “stupid things!” slates, she could even make one did not know spell “stupid,” he ask his neighbour tell him. “A nice muddle slates’ll trial’s over!” thought Alice. One jurors pencil squeaked. This course, Alice could _not_ stand, she went round court got behind him, soon found opportunity taking away. She quickly poor little juror (it Bill, Lizard) could make become it; so, hunting it, he obliged write one finger rest day; little use, left mark slate. “Herald, read accusation!” said King. On White Rabbit blew three blasts trumpet, unrolled parchment scroll, read follows:— “The Queen Hearts, she made tarts, All summer day: The Knave Hearts, he stole tarts, And took quite away!” “Consider verdict,” King said jury. “Not yet, yet!” Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There is great deal come that!” “Call first witness,” said King; White Rabbit blew three blasts trumpet, called out, “First witness!” The first witness Hatter. He came teacup one hand piece bread-and-butter other. “I beg pardon, Majesty,” he began, “for bringing in: I had not quite finished tea I sent for.” “You ought finished,” said King. “When begin?” The Hatter looked March Hare, followed court, arm-in-arm Dormouse. “Fourteenth March, I _think_ was,” he said. “Fifteenth,” said March Hare. “Sixteenth,” added Dormouse. “Write down,” King said jury, jury eagerly wrote three dates slates, added up, reduced answer shillings pence. “Take hat,” King said Hatter. “It is not mine,” said Hatter. “_Stolen!_” King exclaimed, turning jury, instantly made memorandum fact. “I keep sell,” Hatter added explanation; “I have none own. I am hatter.” Here Queen put her spectacles, began staring Hatter, turned pale fidgeted. “Give evidence,” said King; “and do not nervous, I will executed spot.” This seem encourage witness all: he kept shifting one foot other, looking uneasily Queen, his confusion he bit large piece his teacup instead bread-and-butter. Just moment Alice felt curious sensation, puzzled her good deal she made was: she beginning grow larger again, she thought first she would get leave court; second thoughts she decided remain she long room her. “I wish would not squeeze so.” said Dormouse, sitting next her. “I hardly breathe.” “I cannot help it,” said Alice meekly: “I am growing.” “You have right grow _here_,” said Dormouse. “Do not talk nonsense,” said Alice boldly: “you know you are growing too.” “Yes, _I_ grow reasonable pace,” said Dormouse: “not ridiculous fashion.” And he got sulkily crossed side court. All time Queen never left staring Hatter, and, Dormouse crossed court, she said one officers court, “Bring list singers last concert!” wretched Hatter trembled so, he shook his shoes off. “Give evidence,” King repeated angrily, “or I will executed, whether you are nervous not.” “I am poor man, Majesty,” Hatter began, trembling voice, “—and I had not begun tea—not week so—and bread-and-butter getting thin—and twinkling tea—” “The twinkling _what?_” said King. “It _began_ tea,” Hatter replied. “Of course twinkling begins T!” said King sharply. “Do take dunce? Go on!” “I am poor man,” Hatter went on, “and things twinkled that—only March Hare said—” “I did not!” March Hare interrupted great hurry. “You did!” said Hatter. “I deny it!” said March Hare. “He denies it,” said King: “leave part.” “Well, rate, Dormouse said—” Hatter went on, looking anxiously round see he would deny too: Dormouse denied nothing, fast asleep. “After that,” continued Hatter, “I cut bread-and-butter—” “But Dormouse say?” one jury asked. “That I cannot remember,” said Hatter. “You _must_ remember,” remarked King, “or I will executed.” The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup bread-and-butter, went one knee. “I am poor man, Majesty,” he began. “You are _very_ poor _speaker_,” said King. Here one guinea-pigs cheered, immediately suppressed officers court. (As rather hard word, I explain done. They large canvas bag, tied mouth strings: slipped guinea-pig, head first, sat upon it.) “I am glad I have seen done,” thought Alice. “I have often read newspapers, end trials, “There attempts applause, immediately suppressed officers court,” I never understood meant till now.” “If that is know it, may stand down,” continued King. “I cannot go lower,” said Hatter: “I am floor, is.” “Then may _sit_ down,” King replied. Here guinea-pig cheered, suppressed. “Come, finished guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now shall get better.” “I would rather finish tea,” said Hatter, anxious look Queen, reading list singers. “You may go,” said King, Hatter hurriedly left court, without even waiting put his shoes on. “—and take his head outside,” Queen added one officers: Hatter sight officer could get door. “Call next witness!” said King. The next witness Duchess’s cook. She carried pepper-box her hand, Alice guessed was, even she got court, way people near door began sneezing once. “Give evidence,” said King. “Shall not,” said cook. The King looked anxiously White Rabbit, said low voice, “Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.” “Well, I must, I must,” King said, melancholy air, and, folding his arms frowning cook till his eyes nearly sight, he said deep voice, “What tarts made of?” “Pepper, mostly,” said cook. “Treacle,” said sleepy voice behind her. “Collar Dormouse,” Queen shrieked out. “Behead Dormouse! Turn Dormouse court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off his whiskers!” For minutes whole court confusion, getting Dormouse turned out, and, time settled again, cook disappeared. “Never mind!” said King, air great relief. “Call next witness.” And he added undertone Queen, “Really, dear, _you_ must cross-examine next witness. It quite makes forehead ache!” Alice watched White Rabbit he fumbled list, feeling curious see next witness would like, “—for have not got much evidence _yet_,” she said herself. Imagine her surprise, White Rabbit read out, top his shrill little voice, name “Alice!” CHAPTER XII. Alice’s Evidence “Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting flurry moment large she grown last minutes, she jumped hurry she tipped jury-box edge her skirt, upsetting jurymen heads crowd below, lay sprawling about, reminding her much globe goldfish she accidentally upset week before. “Oh, I _beg_ pardon!” she exclaimed tone great dismay, began picking quickly she could, accident goldfish kept running her head, she vague sort idea must collected put back jury-box, would die. “The trial cannot proceed,” said King grave voice, “until jurymen back proper places—_all_,” he repeated great emphasis, looking hard Alice he said so. Alice looked jury-box, saw that, her haste, she put Lizard head downwards, poor little thing waving tail melancholy way, quite unable move. She soon got again, put right; “not signifies much,” she said herself; “I think would _quite_ much use trial one way other.” As soon jury little recovered shock upset, slates pencils found handed back them, set work diligently write history accident, except Lizard, seemed much overcome anything sit mouth open, gazing roof court. “What know business?” King said Alice. “Nothing,” said Alice. “Nothing _whatever?_” persisted King. “Nothing whatever,” said Alice. “That is important,” King said, turning jury. They beginning write slates, White Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, Majesty means, course,” he said respectful tone, frowning making faces he spoke. “_Un_important, course, I meant,” King hastily said, went undertone, “important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” he trying word sounded best. Some jury wrote “important,” “unimportant.” Alice could see this, she near enough look slates; “but does not matter bit,” she thought herself. At moment King, time busily writing his note-book, cackled “Silence!” read his book, “Rule Forty-two. _All persons mile high leave court_.” Everybody looked Alice. “_I’m_ mile high,” said Alice. “You are,” said King. “Nearly two miles high,” added Queen. “Well, I shall not go, rate,” said Alice: “besides, that is regular rule: invented now.” “It is oldest rule book,” said King. “Then ought Number One,” said Alice. The King turned pale, shut his note-book hastily. “Consider verdict,” he said jury, low, trembling voice. “There is evidence come yet, please Majesty,” said White Rabbit, jumping great hurry; “this paper picked up.” “What is it?” said Queen. “I have not opened yet,” said White Rabbit, “but seems letter, written prisoner to—to somebody.” “It must that,” said King, “unless written nobody, is not usual, know.” “Who directed to?” said one jurymen. “It is not directed all,” said White Rabbit; “in fact, there is nothing written _outside_.” He unfolded paper he spoke, added “It is not letter, all: it is set verses.” “Are prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another jurymen. “No, they are not,” said White Rabbit, “and that is queerest thing it.” (The jury looked puzzled.) “He must imitated somebody else’s hand,” said King. (The jury brightened again.) “Please Majesty,” said Knave, “I did not write it, cannot prove I did: there is name signed end.” “If did not sign it,” said King, “that makes matter worse. You _must_ meant mischief, else you would signed name like honest man.” There general clapping hands this: first really clever thing King said day. “That _proves_ his guilt,” said Queen. “It proves nothing sort!” said Alice. “Why, do not even know they are about!” “Read them,” said King. The White Rabbit put his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please Majesty?” he asked. “Begin beginning,” King said gravely, “and go till come end: stop.” These verses White Rabbit read:— “They told her, And mentioned him: She gave good character, But said I could swim. He sent word I gone (We know true): If she push matter on, What would become you? I gave her one, gave two, You gave us three more; They returned you, Though mine before. If I she chance Involved affair, He trusts set free, Exactly were. My notion (Before she fit) An obstacle came Him, ourselves, it. Do not let know she liked best, For must ever A secret, kept rest, Between me.” “That is important piece evidence we have heard yet,” said King, rubbing his hands; “so let jury—” “If one explain it,” said Alice, (she grown large last minutes she was not bit afraid interrupting him,) “I will give sixpence. _I_ do not believe there is atom meaning it.” The jury wrote slates, “_She_ does not believe there is atom meaning it,” none attempted explain paper. “If there is meaning it,” said King, “that saves world trouble, know, need not try find any. And yet I do not know,” he went on, spreading verses his knee, looking one eye; “I seem see meaning them, all. “—_said I could swim_—” cannot swim, you?” he added, turning Knave. The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he certainly _not_, made entirely cardboard.) “All right, far,” said King, he went muttering verses himself: “‘_We know true_—’ that is jury, course—‘_I gave her one, gave two_—’ why, must he tarts, know—” “But, goes ‘_they returned you_,’” said Alice. “Why, are!” said King triumphantly, pointing tarts table. “Nothing clearer _that_. Then again—‘_before she fit_—’ never fits, dear, I think?” he said Queen. “Never!” said Queen furiously, throwing inkstand Lizard she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill left writing his slate one finger, he found made mark; he hastily began again, using ink, trickling his face, long lasted.) “Then words do not _fit_ you,” said King, looking round court smile. There dead silence. “It is pun!” King added offended tone, everybody laughed, “Let jury consider verdict,” King said, twentieth time day. “No, no!” said Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.” “Stuff nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea sentence first!” “Hold tongue!” said Queen, turning purple. “I will not!” said Alice. “Off her head!” Queen shouted top her voice. Nobody moved. “Who cares you?” said Alice, (she grown her full size time.) “You are nothing pack cards!” At whole pack rose air, came flying upon her: she gave little scream, half fright half anger, tried beat off, found herself lying bank, her head lap her sister, gently brushing away dead leaves fluttered trees upon her face. “Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, long sleep you have had!” “Oh, I have curious dream!” said Alice, she told her sister, well she could remember them, strange Adventures reading about; she finished, her sister kissed her, said, “It _was_ curious dream, dear, certainly: run tea; it is getting late.” So Alice got ran off, thinking she ran, well she might, wonderful dream been. But her sister sat still she left her, leaning her head her hand, watching setting sun, thinking little Alice her wonderful Adventures, till she began dreaming fashion, her dream:— First, she dreamed little Alice herself, tiny hands clasped upon her knee, bright eager eyes looking hers—she could hear tones her voice, see queer little toss her head keep back wandering hair _would_ always get her eyes—and still she listened, seemed listen, whole place around her became alive strange creatures her little sister’s dream. The long grass rustled her feet White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way neighbouring pool—she could hear rattle teacups March Hare his friends shared never-ending meal, shrill voice Queen ordering her unfortunate guests execution—once pig-baby sneezing Duchess’s knee, plates dishes crashed around it—once shriek Gryphon, squeaking Lizard’s slate-pencil, choking suppressed guinea-pigs, filled air, mixed distant sobs miserable Mock Turtle. So she sat on, closed eyes, half believed herself Wonderland, though she knew she open again, would change dull reality—the grass would rustling wind, pool rippling waving reeds—the rattling teacups would change tinkling sheep-bells, Queen’s shrill cries voice shepherd boy—and sneeze baby, shriek Gryphon, queer noises, would change (she knew) confused clamour busy farm-yard—while lowing cattle distance would take place Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured herself little sister would, after-time, herself grown woman; she would keep, her riper years, simple loving heart her childhood: she would gather her little children, make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale, perhaps even dream Wonderland long ago: she would feel simple sorrows, find pleasure simple joys, remembering her child-life, happy summer days.
