 THE JUNGLE BOOK Mowgli’s Brothers Now Rann Kite brings home night That Mang Bat sets free-- The herds shut byre hut For loosed till dawn we. This hour pride power, Talon tush claw. Oh, hear call!--Good hunting That keep Jungle Law! Night-Song Jungle It seven of the clock warm evening Seeonee hills Father Wolf woke his day’s rest, scratched himself, yawned, spread his paws one get rid sleepy feeling tips. Mother Wolf lay her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, moon shone mouth cave lived. “Augrh!” said Father Wolf. “It time hunt again.” He going spring hill little shadow bushy tail crossed threshold whined: “Good luck go you, O Chief Wolves. And good luck strong white teeth go noble children may never forget hungry world.” It jackal--Tabaqui, Dish-licker--and wolves India despise Tabaqui he runs making mischief, telling tales, eating rags pieces leather village rubbish-heaps. But afraid too, Tabaqui, anyone else jungle, apt go mad, he forgets he ever afraid anyone, runs forest biting everything his way. Even tiger runs hides little Tabaqui goes mad, madness disgraceful thing overtake wild creature. We call hydrophobia, call dewanee--the madness--and run. “Enter, then, look,” said Father Wolf stiffly, “but food here.” “For wolf, no,” said Tabaqui, “but mean person dry bone good feast. Who we, Gidur-log [the jackal people], pick choose?” He scuttled back cave, he found bone buck meat it, sat cracking end merrily. “All thanks good meal,” he said, licking his lips. “How beautiful noble children! How large eyes! And young too! Indeed, indeed, I might remembered children kings men beginning.” Now, Tabaqui knew well anyone else nothing unlucky compliment children faces. It pleased see Mother Father Wolf look uncomfortable. Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing mischief he made, he said spitefully: “Shere Khan, Big One, shifted his hunting grounds. He hunt among hills next moon, he told me.” Shere Khan tiger lived near Waingunga River, twenty miles away. “He right!” Father Wolf began angrily--“By Law Jungle he right change his quarters without due warning. He frighten every head game within ten miles, I--I kill two, days.” “His mother call Lungri [the Lame One] nothing,” said Mother Wolf quietly. “He lame one foot his birth. That he killed cattle. Now villagers Waingunga angry him, he come make villagers angry. They scour jungle he far away, children must run grass set alight. Indeed, grateful Shere Khan!” “Shall I tell gratitude?” said Tabaqui. “Out!” snapped Father Wolf. “Out hunt thy master. Thou hast done harm enough one night.” “I go,” said Tabaqui quietly. “Ye hear Shere Khan thickets. I might saved message.” Father Wolf listened, valley ran little river he heard dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine tiger caught nothing care jungle knows it. “The fool!” said Father Wolf. “To begin night’s work noise! Does he think buck like his fat Waingunga bullocks?” “H’sh. It neither bullock buck he hunts to-night,” said Mother Wolf. “It Man.” The whine changed sort humming purr seemed come every quarter compass. It noise bewilders woodcutters gypsies sleeping open, makes run sometimes mouth tiger. “Man!” said Father Wolf, showing his white teeth. “Faugh! Are enough beetles frogs tanks he must eat Man, ground too!” The Law Jungle, never orders anything without reason, forbids every beast eat Man except he killing show his children kill, he must hunt outside hunting grounds his pack tribe. The real reason man-killing means, sooner later, arrival white men elephants, guns, hundreds brown men gongs rockets torches. Then everybody jungle suffers. The reason beasts give among Man weakest defenseless living things, unsportsmanlike touch him. They say too--and true--that man-eaters become mangy, lose teeth. The purr grew louder, ended full-throated “Aaarh!” tiger’s charge. Then howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan. “He missed,” said Mother Wolf. “What it?” Father Wolf ran paces heard Shere Khan muttering mumbling savagely he tumbled scrub. “The fool sense jump woodcutter’s campfire, burned his feet,” said Father Wolf grunt. “Tabaqui him.” “Something coming uphill,” said Mother Wolf, twitching one ear. “Get ready.” The bushes rustled little thicket, Father Wolf dropped his haunches him, ready his leap. Then, watching, would seen wonderful thing world--the wolf checked mid-spring. He made his bound he saw he jumping at, he tried stop himself. The result he shot straight air four five feet, landing almost he left ground. “Man!” he snapped. “A man’s cub. Look!” Directly front him, holding low branch, stood naked brown baby could walk--as soft dimpled little atom ever came wolf’s cave night. He looked Father Wolf’s face, laughed. “Is man’s cub?” said Mother Wolf. “I never seen one. Bring here.” A Wolf accustomed moving his cubs can, necessary, mouth egg without breaking it, though Father Wolf’s jaws closed right child’s back tooth even scratched skin he laid among cubs. “How little! How naked, and--how bold!” said Mother Wolf softly. The baby pushing his way cubs get close warm hide. “Ahai! He taking his meal others. And man’s cub. Now, ever wolf could boast man’s cub among her children?” “I heard thing, never Pack time,” said Father Wolf. “He altogether without hair, I could kill touch foot. But see, he looks afraid.” The moonlight blocked mouth cave, Shere Khan’s great square head shoulders thrust entrance. Tabaqui, behind him, squeaking: “My lord, lord, went here!” “Shere Khan us great honor,” said Father Wolf, his eyes angry. “What Shere Khan need?” “My quarry. A man’s cub went way,” said Shere Khan. “Its parents run off. Give me.” Shere Khan jumped woodcutter’s campfire, Father Wolf said, furious pain his burned feet. But Father Wolf knew mouth cave narrow tiger come by. Even he was, Shere Khan’s shoulders forepaws cramped want room, man’s would he tried fight barrel. “The Wolves free people,” said Father Wolf. “They take orders Head Pack, striped cattle-killer. The man’s cub ours--to kill choose.” “Ye choose ye choose! What talk choosing? By bull I killed, I stand nosing dog’s den fair dues? It I, Shere Khan, speak!” The tiger’s roar filled cave thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself clear cubs sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons darkness, facing blazing eyes Shere Khan. “And I, Raksha [The Demon], answers. The man’s cub mine, Lungri--mine me! He shall killed. He shall live run Pack hunt Pack; end, look you, hunter little naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he shall hunt thee! Now get hence, Sambhur I killed (I eat starved cattle), back thou goest thy mother, burned beast jungle, lamer ever thou camest world! Go!” Father Wolf looked amazed. He almost forgotten days he Mother Wolf fair fight five wolves, she ran Pack called The Demon compliment’s sake. Shere Khan might faced Father Wolf, he could stand Mother Wolf, he knew he she advantage ground, would fight death. So he backed cave mouth growling, he clear he shouted: “Each dog barks his yard! We see Pack say fostering man-cubs. The cub mine, teeth he come end, O bush-tailed thieves!” Mother Wolf threw herself panting among cubs, Father Wolf said her gravely: “Shere Khan speaks much truth. The cub must shown Pack. Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?” “Keep him!” she gasped. “He came naked, night, alone hungry; yet he afraid! Look, he pushed one babes one side already. And lame butcher would killed would run Waingunga villagers hunted lairs revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I keep him. Lie still, little frog. O thou Mowgli--for Mowgli Frog I call thee--the time come thou wilt hunt Shere Khan he hunted thee.” “But Pack say?” said Father Wolf. The Law Jungle lays clearly wolf may, he marries, withdraw Pack he belongs to. But soon his cubs old enough stand feet he must bring Pack Council, generally held month full moon, order wolves may identify them. After inspection cubs free run please, killed first buck excuse accepted grown wolf Pack kills one them. The punishment death murderer found; think minute see must so. Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run little, night Pack Meeting took Mowgli Mother Wolf Council Rock--a hilltop covered stones boulders hundred wolves could hide. Akela, great gray Lone Wolf, led Pack strength cunning, lay full length his rock, sat forty wolves every size color, badger-colored veterans could handle buck alone young black three-year-olds thought could. The Lone Wolf led year now. He fallen twice wolf trap his youth, he beaten left dead; he knew manners customs men. There little talking Rock. The cubs tumbled center circle mothers fathers sat, senior wolf would go quietly cub, look carefully, return his place noiseless feet. Sometimes mother would push her cub far moonlight sure he overlooked. Akela his rock would cry: “Ye know Law--ye know Law. Look well, O Wolves!” And anxious mothers would take call: “Look--look well, O Wolves!” At last--and Mother Wolf’s neck bristles lifted time came--Father Wolf pushed “Mowgli Frog,” called him, center, he sat laughing playing pebbles glistened moonlight. Akela never raised his head his paws, went monotonous cry: “Look well!” A muffled roar came behind rocks--the voice Shere Khan crying: “The cub mine. Give me. What Free People man’s cub?” Akela never even twitched his ears. All he said was: “Look well, O Wolves! What Free People orders save Free People? Look well!” There chorus deep growls, young wolf his fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question Akela: “What Free People man’s cub?” Now, Law Jungle lays dispute right cub accepted Pack, he must spoken least two members Pack his father mother. “Who speaks cub?” said Akela. “Among Free People speaks?” There answer Mother Wolf got ready she knew would her last fight, things came fighting. Then creature allowed Pack Council--Baloo, sleepy brown bear teaches wolf cubs Law Jungle: old Baloo, come go he pleases he eats nuts roots honey--rose upon his hind quarters grunted. “The man’s cub--the man’s cub?” he said. “I speak man’s cub. There harm man’s cub. I gift words, I speak truth. Let run Pack, entered others. I teach him.” “We need yet another,” said Akela. “Baloo spoken, he teacher young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?” A black shadow dropped circle. It Bagheera Black Panther, inky black over, panther markings showing certain lights like pattern watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, nobody cared cross his path; he cunning Tabaqui, bold wild buffalo, reckless wounded elephant. But he voice soft wild honey dripping tree, skin softer down. “O Akela, ye Free People,” he purred, “I right assembly, Law Jungle says doubt killing matter regard new cub, life cub may bought price. And Law say may may pay price. Am I right?” “Good! Good!” said young wolves, always hungry. “Listen Bagheera. The cub bought price. It Law.” “Knowing I right speak here, I ask leave.” “Speak then,” cried twenty voices. “To kill naked cub shame. Besides, he may make better sport he grown. Baloo spoken his behalf. Now Baloo’s word I add one bull, fat one, newly killed, half mile here, ye accept man’s cub according Law. Is difficult?” There clamor scores voices, saying: “What matter? He die winter rains. He scorch sun. What harm naked frog us? Let run Pack. Where bull, Bagheera? Let accepted.” And came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well--look well, O Wolves!” Mowgli still deeply interested pebbles, he notice wolves came looked one one. At last went hill dead bull, Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, Mowgli’s wolves left. Shere Khan roared still night, he angry Mowgli handed him. “Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, his whiskers, “for time come naked thing make thee roar another tune, I know nothing man.” “It well done,” said Akela. “Men cubs wise. He may help time.” “Truly, help time need; none hope lead Pack forever,” said Bagheera. Akela said nothing. He thinking time comes every leader every pack his strength goes he gets feebler feebler, till last he killed wolves new leader comes up--to killed his turn. “Take away,” he said Father Wolf, “and train befits one Free People.” And Mowgli entered Seeonee Wolf Pack price bull Baloo’s good word. Now must content skip ten eleven whole years, guess wonderful life Mowgli led among wolves, written would fill ever many books. He grew cubs, though they, course, grown wolves almost he child. And Father Wolf taught his business, meaning things jungle, till every rustle grass, every breath warm night air, every note owls his head, every scratch bat’s claws roosted tree, every splash every little fish jumping pool meant much work his office means business man. When he learning he sat sun slept, ate went sleep again. When he felt dirty hot he swam forest pools; he wanted honey (Baloo told honey nuts pleasant eat raw meat) he climbed it, Bagheera showed do. Bagheera would lie branch call, “Come along, Little Brother,” first Mowgli would cling like sloth, afterward he would fling branches almost boldly gray ape. He took his place Council Rock, too, Pack met, he discovered he stared hard wolf, wolf would forced drop his eyes, he used stare fun. At times he would pick long thorns pads his friends, wolves suffer terribly thorns burs coats. He would go hillside cultivated lands night, look curiously villagers huts, he mistrust men Bagheera showed square box drop gate cunningly hidden jungle he nearly walked it, told trap. He loved better anything else go Bagheera dark warm heart forest, sleep drowsy day, night see Bagheera his killing. Bagheera killed right left he felt hungry, Mowgli--with one exception. As soon he old enough understand things, Bagheera told he must never touch cattle he bought Pack price bull’s life. “All jungle thine,” said Bagheera, “and thou canst kill everything thou art strong enough kill; sake bull bought thee thou must never kill eat cattle young old. That Law Jungle.” Mowgli obeyed faithfully. And he grew grew strong boy must grow know he learning lessons, nothing world think except things eat. Mother Wolf told twice Shere Khan creature trusted, day he must kill Shere Khan. But though young wolf would remembered advice every hour, Mowgli forgot he boy--though he would called wolf he able speak human tongue. Shere Khan always crossing his path jungle, Akela grew older feebler lame tiger come great friends younger wolves Pack, followed scraps, thing Akela would never allowed he dared push his authority proper bounds. Then Shere Khan would flatter wonder fine young hunters content led dying wolf man’s cub. “They tell me,” Shere Khan would say, “that Council ye dare look eyes.” And young wolves would growl bristle. Bagheera, eyes ears everywhere, knew something this, twice he told Mowgli many words Shere Khan would kill day. Mowgli would laugh answer: “I Pack I thee; Baloo, though he lazy, might strike blow two sake. Why I afraid?” It one warm day new notion came Bagheera--born something he heard. Perhaps Ikki Porcupine told him; he said Mowgli deep jungle, boy lay his head Bagheera’s beautiful black skin, “Little Brother, often I told thee Shere Khan thy enemy?” “As many times nuts palm,” said Mowgli, who, naturally, could count. “What it? I sleepy, Bagheera, Shere Khan long tail loud talk--like Mao, Peacock.” “But time sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; Pack know it; even foolish, foolish deer know. Tabaqui told thee too.” “Ho! ho!” said Mowgli. “Tabaqui came long ago rude talk I naked man’s cub fit dig pig-nuts. But I caught Tabaqui tail swung twice palm-tree teach better manners.” “That foolishness, though Tabaqui mischief-maker, he would told thee something concerned thee closely. Open eyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare kill thee jungle. But remember, Akela old, soon day comes he cannot kill his buck, he leader more. Many wolves looked thee thou wast brought Council first old too, young wolves believe, Shere Khan taught them, man-cub place Pack. In little time thou wilt man.” “And man he run his brothers?” said Mowgli. “I born jungle. I obeyed Law Jungle, wolf whose paws I pulled thorn. Surely brothers!” Bagheera stretched full length half shut his eyes. “Little Brother,” said he, “feel jaw.” Mowgli put his strong brown hand, Bagheera’s silky chin, giant rolling muscles hid glossy hair, he came upon little bald spot. “There one jungle knows I, Bagheera, carry mark--the mark collar; yet, Little Brother, I born among men, among men mother died--in cages king’s palace Oodeypore. It I paid price thee Council thou wast little naked cub. Yes, I born among men. I never seen jungle. They fed behind bars iron pan till one night I felt I Bagheera--the Panther--and man’s plaything, I broke silly lock one blow paw came away. And I learned ways men, I became terrible jungle Shere Khan. Is so?” “Yes,” said Mowgli, “all jungle fear Bagheera--all except Mowgli.” “Oh, thou art man’s cub,” said Black Panther tenderly. “And even I returned jungle, thou must go back men last--to men thy brothers--if thou art killed Council.” “But why--but wish kill me?” said Mowgli. “Look me,” said Bagheera. And Mowgli looked steadily eyes. The big panther turned his head away half minute. “That why,” he said, shifting his paw leaves. “Not even I look thee eyes, I born among men, I love thee, Little Brother. The others hate thee eyes cannot meet thine; thou art wise; thou hast pulled thorns feet--because thou art man.” “I know things,” said Mowgli sullenly, he frowned his heavy black eyebrows. “What Law Jungle? Strike first give tongue. By thy carelessness know thou art man. But wise. It heart Akela misses his next kill--and hunt costs pin buck--the Pack turn thee. They hold jungle Council Rock, then--and then--I it!” said Bagheera, leaping up. “Go thou quickly men’s huts valley, take Red Flower grow there, time comes thou mayest even stronger friend I Baloo Pack love thee. Get Red Flower.” By Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, creature jungle call fire proper name. Every beast lives deadly fear it, invents hundred ways describing it. “The Red Flower?” said Mowgli. “That grows outside huts twilight. I get some.” “There speaks man’s cub,” said Bagheera proudly. “Remember grows little pots. Get one swiftly, keep thee time need.” “Good!” said Mowgli. “I go. But art thou sure, O Bagheera”--he slipped his arm around splendid neck looked deep big eyes--“art thou sure Shere Khan’s doing?” “By Broken Lock freed me, I sure, Little Brother.” “Then, Bull bought me, I pay Shere Khan full tale this, may little over,” said Mowgli, he bounded away. “That man. That man,” said Bagheera himself, lying again. “Oh, Shere Khan, never blacker hunting frog-hunt thine ten years ago!” Mowgli far far forest, running hard, his heart hot him. He came cave evening mist rose, drew breath, looked valley. The cubs out, Mother Wolf, back cave, knew his breathing something troubling her frog. “What it, Son?” she said. “Some bat’s chatter Shere Khan,” he called back. “I hunt among plowed fields tonight,” he plunged downward bushes, stream bottom valley. There he checked, he heard yell Pack hunting, heard bellow hunted Sambhur, snort buck turned bay. Then wicked, bitter howls young wolves: “Akela! Akela! Let Lone Wolf show his strength. Room leader Pack! Spring, Akela!” The Lone Wolf must sprung missed his hold, Mowgli heard snap his teeth yelp Sambhur knocked his forefoot. He wait anything more, dashed on; yells grew fainter behind he ran croplands villagers lived. “Bagheera spoke truth,” he panted, he nestled cattle fodder window hut. “To-morrow one day Akela me.” Then he pressed his face close window watched fire hearth. He saw husbandman’s wife get feed night black lumps. And morning came mists white cold, he saw man’s child pick wicker pot plastered inside earth, fill lumps red-hot charcoal, put his blanket, go tend cows byre. “Is all?” said Mowgli. “If cub it, nothing fear.” So he strode round corner met boy, took pot his hand, disappeared mist boy howled fear. “They like me,” said Mowgli, blowing pot he seen woman do. “This thing die I give things eat”; he dropped twigs dried bark red stuff. Halfway hill he met Bagheera morning dew shining like moonstones his coat. “Akela missed,” said Panther. “They would killed last night, needed thee also. They looking thee hill.” “I among plowed lands. I ready. See!” Mowgli held fire-pot. “Good! Now, I seen men thrust dry branch stuff, presently Red Flower blossomed end it. Art thou afraid?” “No. Why I fear? I remember now--if dream--how, I Wolf, I lay beside Red Flower, warm pleasant.” All day Mowgli sat cave tending his fire pot dipping dry branches see looked. He found branch satisfied him, evening Tabaqui came cave told rudely enough he wanted Council Rock, he laughed till Tabaqui ran away. Then Mowgli went Council, still laughing. Akela Lone Wolf lay side his rock sign leadership Pack open, Shere Khan his following scrap-fed wolves walked fro openly flattered. Bagheera lay close Mowgli, fire pot Mowgli’s knees. When gathered together, Shere Khan began speak--a thing he would never dared Akela his prime. “He right,” whispered Bagheera. “Say so. He dog’s son. He frightened.” Mowgli sprang his feet. “Free People,” he cried, “does Shere Khan lead Pack? What tiger leadership?” “Seeing leadership yet open, asked speak--” Shere Khan began. “By whom?” said Mowgli. “Are jackals, fawn cattle butcher? The leadership Pack Pack alone.” There yells “Silence, thou man’s cub!” “Let speak. He kept Law”; last seniors Pack thundered: “Let Dead Wolf speak.” When leader Pack missed his kill, he called Dead Wolf long he lives, long. Akela raised his old head wearily:-- “Free People, ye too, jackals Shere Khan, twelve seasons I led ye kill, time one trapped maimed. Now I missed kill. Ye know plot made. Ye know ye brought untried buck make weakness known. It cleverly done. Your right kill Council Rock, now. Therefore, I ask, comes make end Lone Wolf? For right, Law Jungle, ye come one one.” There long hush, single wolf cared fight Akela death. Then Shere Khan roared: “Bah! What toothless fool? He doomed die! It man-cub lived long. Free People, he meat first. Give me. I weary man-wolf folly. He troubled jungle ten seasons. Give man-cub, I hunt always, give one bone. He man, man’s child, marrow bones I hate him!” Then half Pack yelled: “A man! A man! What man us? Let go his place.” “And turn people villages us?” clamored Shere Khan. “No, give me. He man, none us look eyes.” Akela lifted his head said, “He eaten food. He slept us. He driven game us. He broken word Law Jungle.” “Also, I paid bull he accepted. The worth bull little, Bagheera’s honor something he perhaps fight for,” said Bagheera his gentlest voice. “A bull paid ten years ago!” Pack snarled. “What care bones ten years old?” “Or pledge?” said Bagheera, his white teeth bared his lip. “Well ye called Free People!” “No man’s cub run people jungle,” howled Shere Khan. “Give me!” “He brother blood,” Akela went on, “and ye would kill here! In truth, I lived long. Some ye eaters cattle, others I heard that, Shere Khan’s teaching, ye go dark night snatch children villager’s doorstep. Therefore I know ye cowards, cowards I speak. It certain I must die, life worth, I would offer man-cub’s place. But sake Honor Pack,--a little matter without leader ye forgotten,--I promise ye let man-cub go his place, I not, time comes die, bare one tooth ye. I die without fighting. That least save Pack three lives. More I cannot do; ye will, I save ye shame comes killing brother fault--a brother spoken bought Pack according Law Jungle.” “He man--a man--a man!” snarled Pack. And wolves began gather round Shere Khan, whose tail beginning switch. “Now business thy hands,” said Bagheera Mowgli. “We except fight.” Mowgli stood upright--the fire pot his hands. Then he stretched his arms, yawned face Council; he furious rage sorrow, for, wolflike, wolves never told hated him. “Listen you!” he cried. “There need dog’s jabber. Ye told often tonight I man (and indeed I would wolf life’s end) I feel words true. So I call ye brothers more, sag [dogs], man should. What ye do, ye do, say. That matter me; may see matter plainly, I, man, brought little Red Flower ye, dogs, fear.” He flung fire pot ground, red coals lit tuft dried moss flared up, Council drew back terror leaping flames. Mowgli thrust his dead branch fire till twigs lit crackled, whirled his head among cowering wolves. “Thou art master,” said Bagheera undertone. “Save Akela death. He ever thy friend.” Akela, grim old wolf never asked mercy his life, gave one piteous look Mowgli boy stood naked, his long black hair tossing his shoulders light blazing branch made shadows jump quiver. “Good!” said Mowgli, staring round slowly. “I see ye dogs. I go people--if people. The jungle shut me, I must forget talk companionship. But I merciful ye are. Because I brother blood, I promise I man among men I betray ye men ye betrayed me.” He kicked fire his foot, sparks flew up. “There shall war us Pack. But debt pay I go.” He strode forward Shere Khan sat blinking stupidly flames, caught tuft his chin. Bagheera followed case accidents. “Up, dog!” Mowgli cried. “Up, man speaks, I set coat ablaze!” Shere Khan’s ears lay flat back his head, he shut his eyes, blazing branch near. “This cattle-killer said he would kill Council he killed I cub. Thus thus, then, beat dogs men. Stir whisker, Lungri, I ram Red Flower thy gullet!” He beat Shere Khan head branch, tiger whimpered whined agony fear. “Pah! Singed jungle cat--go now! But remember next I come Council Rock, man come, Shere Khan’s hide head. For rest, Akela goes free live he pleases. Ye kill him, will. Nor I think ye sit longer, lolling tongues though ye somebodies, instead dogs I drive out--thus! Go!” The fire burning furiously end branch, Mowgli struck right left round circle, wolves ran howling sparks burning fur. At last Akela, Bagheera, perhaps ten wolves taken Mowgli’s part. Then something began hurt Mowgli inside him, he never hurt his life before, he caught his breath sobbed, tears ran his face. “What it? What it?” he said. “I wish leave jungle, I know is. Am I dying, Bagheera?” “No, Little Brother. That tears men use,” said Bagheera. “Now I know thou art man, man’s cub longer. The jungle shut indeed thee henceforward. Let fall, Mowgli. They tears.” So Mowgli sat cried though his heart would break; he never cried his life before. “Now,” he said, “I go men. But first I must say farewell mother.” And he went cave she lived Father Wolf, he cried her coat, four cubs howled miserably. “Ye forget me?” said Mowgli. “Never follow trail,” said cubs. “Come foot hill thou art man, talk thee; come croplands play thee night.” “Come soon!” said Father Wolf. “Oh, wise little frog, come soon; old, thy mother I.” “Come soon,” said Mother Wolf, “little naked son mine. For, listen, child man, I loved thee ever I loved cubs.” “I surely come,” said Mowgli. “And I come lay Shere Khan’s hide upon Council Rock. Do forget me! Tell jungle never forget me!” The dawn beginning break Mowgli went hillside alone, meet mysterious things called men. Hunting-Song Seeonee Pack As dawn breaking Sambhur belled Once, twice again! And doe leaped up, doe leaped From pond wood wild deer sup. This I, scouting alone, beheld, Once, twice again! As dawn breaking Sambhur belled Once, twice again! And wolf stole back, wolf stole back To carry word waiting pack, And sought found bayed his track Once, twice again! As dawn breaking Wolf Pack yelled Once, twice again! Feet jungle leave mark! Eyes see dark--the dark! Tongue--give tongue it! Hark! O hark! Once, twice again! Kaa’s Hunting His spots joy Leopard: his horns Buffalo’s pride. Be clean, strength hunter known gloss his hide. If ye find Bullock toss you, heavy-browed Sambhur gore; Ye need stop work inform us: knew ten seasons before. Oppress cubs stranger, hail Sister Brother, For though little fubsy, may Bear mother. “There none like me!” says Cub pride his earliest kill; But jungle large Cub he small. Let think still. Maxims Baloo All told happened time Mowgli turned Seeonee Wolf Pack, revenged Shere Khan tiger. It days Baloo teaching Law Jungle. The big, serious, old brown bear delighted quick pupil, young wolves learn much Law Jungle applies pack tribe, run away soon repeat Hunting Verse--“Feet make noise; eyes see dark; ears hear winds lairs, sharp white teeth, things marks brothers except Tabaqui Jackal Hyaena hate.” But Mowgli, man-cub, learn great deal this. Sometimes Bagheera Black Panther would come lounging jungle see his pet getting on, would purr his head tree Mowgli recited day’s lesson Baloo. The boy could climb almost well he could swim, swim almost well he could run. So Baloo, Teacher Law, taught Wood Water Laws: tell rotten branch sound one; speak politely wild bees he came upon hive fifty feet ground; say Mang Bat he disturbed branches midday; warn water-snakes pools he splashed among them. None Jungle People like disturbed, ready fly intruder. Then, too, Mowgli taught Strangers’ Hunting Call, must repeated aloud till answered, whenever one Jungle-People hunts outside his grounds. It means, translated, “Give leave hunt I hungry.” And answer is, “Hunt food, pleasure.” All show much Mowgli learn heart, he grew tired saying thing hundred times. But, Baloo said Bagheera, one day Mowgli cuffed run temper, “A man’s cub man’s cub, he must learn Law Jungle.” “But think small he is,” said Black Panther, would spoiled Mowgli he his way. “How his little head carry thy long talk?” “Is anything jungle little killed? No. That I teach things, I hit him, softly, he forgets.” “Softly! What dost thou know softness, old Iron-feet?” Bagheera grunted. “His face bruised today thy--softness. Ugh.” “Better he bruised head foot love he come harm ignorance,” Baloo answered earnestly. “I teaching Master Words Jungle shall protect birds Snake People, hunt four feet, except his pack. He claim protection, he remember words, jungle. Is worth little beating?” “Well, look thou dost kill man-cub. He tree trunk sharpen thy blunt claws upon. But Master Words? I likely give help ask it”--Bagheera stretched one paw admired steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons end it--“still I like know.” “I call Mowgli he shall say them--if he will. Come, Little Brother!” “My head ringing like bee tree,” said sullen little voice heads, Mowgli slid tree trunk angry indignant, adding he reached ground: “I come Bagheera thee, fat old Baloo!” “That one me,” said Baloo, though he hurt grieved. “Tell Bagheera, then, Master Words Jungle I taught thee day.” “Master Words people?” said Mowgli, delighted show off. “The jungle many tongues. I know all.” “A little thou knowest, much. See, O Bagheera, never thank teacher. Not one small wolfling ever come back thank old Baloo his teachings. Say word Hunting-People, then--great scholar.” “We one blood, ye I,” said Mowgli, giving words Bear accent Hunting People use. “Good. Now birds.” Mowgli repeated, Kite’s whistle end sentence. “Now Snake-People,” said Bagheera. The answer perfectly indescribable hiss, Mowgli kicked his feet behind, clapped his hands together applaud himself, jumped Bagheera’s back, he sat sideways, drumming his heels glossy skin making worst faces he could think Baloo. “There--there! That worth little bruise,” said brown bear tenderly. “Some day thou wilt remember me.” Then he turned aside tell Bagheera he begged Master Words Hathi Wild Elephant, knows things, Hathi taken Mowgli pool get Snake Word water-snake, Baloo could pronounce it, Mowgli reasonably safe accidents jungle, neither snake, bird, beast would hurt him. “No one feared,” Baloo wound up, patting his big furry stomach pride. “Except his tribe,” said Bagheera, his breath; aloud Mowgli, “Have care ribs, Little Brother! What dancing down?” Mowgli trying make heard pulling Bagheera’s shoulder fur kicking hard. When two listened he shouting top his voice, “And I shall tribe own, lead branches day long.” “What new folly, little dreamer dreams?” said Bagheera. “Yes, throw branches dirt old Baloo,” Mowgli went on. “They promised this. Ah!” “Whoof!” Baloo’s big paw scooped Mowgli Bagheera’s back, boy lay big fore-paws he could see Bear angry. “Mowgli,” said Baloo, “thou hast talking Bandar-log--the Monkey People.” Mowgli looked Bagheera see Panther angry too, Bagheera’s eyes hard jade stones. “Thou hast Monkey People--the gray apes--the people without law--the eaters everything. That great shame.” “When Baloo hurt head,” said Mowgli (he still his back), “I went away, gray apes came trees pity me. No one else cared.” He snuffled little. “The pity Monkey People!” Baloo snorted. “The stillness mountain stream! The cool summer sun! And then, man-cub?” “And then, then, gave nuts pleasant things eat, they--they carried arms top trees said I blood brother except I tail, leader day.” “They leader,” said Bagheera. “They lie. They always lied.” “They kind bade come again. Why I never taken among Monkey People? They stand feet I do. They hit hard paws. They play day. Let get up! Bad Baloo, let up! I play again.” “Listen, man-cub,” said Bear, his voice rumbled like thunder hot night. “I taught thee Law Jungle peoples jungle--except Monkey-Folk live trees. They law. They outcasts. They speech own, use stolen words overhear listen, peep, wait branches. Their way way. They without leaders. They remembrance. They boast chatter pretend great people great affairs jungle, falling nut turns minds laughter forgotten. We jungle dealings them. We drink monkeys drink; go monkeys go; hunt hunt; die die. Hast thou ever heard speak Bandar-log till today?” “No,” said Mowgli whisper, forest still Baloo finished. “The Jungle-People put mouths minds. They many, evil, dirty, shameless, desire, fixed desire, noticed Jungle People. But notice even throw nuts filth heads.” He hardly spoken shower nuts twigs spattered branches; could hear coughings howlings angry jumpings high air among thin branches. “The Monkey-People forbidden,” said Baloo, “forbidden Jungle-People. Remember.” “Forbidden,” said Bagheera, “but I still think Baloo warned thee them.” “I--I? How I guess he would play dirt. The Monkey People! Faugh!” A fresh shower came heads two trotted away, taking Mowgli them. What Baloo said monkeys perfectly true. They belonged tree-tops, beasts seldom look up, occasion monkeys Jungle-People cross other’s path. But whenever found sick wolf, wounded tiger, bear, monkeys would torment him, would throw sticks nuts beast fun hope noticed. Then would howl shriek senseless songs, invite Jungle-People climb trees fight them, would start furious battles nothing among themselves, leave dead monkeys Jungle-People could see them. They always going leader, laws customs own, never did, memories would hold day day, compromised things making saying, “What Bandar-log think jungle think later,” comforted great deal. None beasts could reach them, hand none beasts would notice them, pleased Mowgli came play them, heard angry Baloo was. They never meant more--the Bandar-log never mean anything all; one invented seemed brilliant idea, he told others Mowgli would useful person keep tribe, he could weave sticks together protection wind; so, caught him, could make teach them. Of course Mowgli, woodcutter’s child, inherited sorts instincts, used make little huts fallen branches without thinking he came it. The Monkey-People, watching trees, considered his play wonderful. This time, said, really going leader become wisest people jungle--so wise everyone else would notice envy them. Therefore followed Baloo Bagheera Mowgli jungle quietly till time midday nap, Mowgli, much ashamed himself, slept Panther Bear, resolving Monkey People. The next thing he remembered feeling hands his legs arms--hard, strong, little hands--and swash branches his face, he staring swaying boughs Baloo woke jungle his deep cries Bagheera bounded trunk every tooth bared. The Bandar-log howled triumph scuffled away upper branches Bagheera dared follow, shouting: “He noticed us! Bagheera noticed us. All Jungle-People admire us skill cunning.” Then began flight; flight Monkey-People tree-land one things nobody describe. They regular roads crossroads, hills hills, laid fifty seventy hundred feet ground, travel even night necessary. Two strongest monkeys caught Mowgli arms swung treetops, twenty feet bound. Had alone could gone twice fast, boy’s weight held back. Sick giddy Mowgli he could help enjoying wild rush, though glimpses earth far frightened him, terrible check jerk end swing nothing empty air brought his heart his teeth. His escort would rush tree till he felt thinnest topmost branches crackle bend them, cough whoop would fling air outward downward, bring up, hanging hands feet lower limbs next tree. Sometimes he could see miles miles across still green jungle, man top mast see miles across sea, branches leaves would lash across face, he his two guards would almost earth again. So, bounding crashing whooping yelling, whole tribe Bandar-log swept along tree-roads Mowgli prisoner. For time he afraid dropped. Then he grew angry knew better struggle, he began think. The first thing send back word Baloo Bagheera, for, pace monkeys going, he knew his friends would left far behind. It useless look down, he could see topsides branches, he stared upward saw, far away blue, Rann Kite balancing wheeling he kept watch jungle waiting things die. Rann saw monkeys carrying something, dropped hundred yards find whether load good eat. He whistled surprise he saw Mowgli dragged treetop heard give Kite call for--“We one blood, thou I.” The waves branches closed boy, Rann balanced away next tree time see little brown face come again. “Mark trail!” Mowgli shouted. “Tell Baloo Seeonee Pack Bagheera Council Rock.” “In whose name, Brother?” Rann never seen Mowgli before, though course he heard him. “Mowgli, Frog. Man-cub call me! Mark trail!” The last words shrieked he swung air, Rann nodded rose till he looked bigger speck dust, he hung, watching his telescope eyes swaying treetops Mowgli’s escort whirled along. “They never go far,” he said chuckle. “They never set do. Always pecking new things Bandar-log. This time, I eye-sight, pecked trouble themselves, Baloo fledgling Bagheera can, I know, kill goats.” So he rocked his wings, his feet gathered him, waited. Meantime, Baloo Bagheera furious rage grief. Bagheera climbed he never climbed before, thin branches broke beneath his weight, he slipped down, his claws full bark. “Why didst thou warn man-cub?” he roared poor Baloo, set clumsy trot hope overtaking monkeys. “What use half slaying blows thou didst warn him?” “Haste! O haste! We--we may catch yet!” Baloo panted. “At speed! It would tire wounded cow. Teacher Law--cub-beater--a mile rolling fro would burst thee open. Sit still think! Make plan. This time chasing. They may drop follow close.” “Arrula! Whoo! They may dropped already, tired carrying him. Who trust Bandar-log? Put dead bats head! Give black bones eat! Roll hives wild bees I may stung death, bury Hyaena, I miserable bears! Arulala! Wahooa! O Mowgli, Mowgli! Why I warn thee Monkey-Folk instead breaking thy head? Now perhaps I may knocked day’s lesson his mind, he alone jungle without Master Words.” Baloo clasped his paws his ears rolled fro moaning. “At least he gave Words correctly little time ago,” said Bagheera impatiently. “Baloo, thou hast neither memory respect. What would jungle think I, Black Panther, curled like Ikki Porcupine, howled?” “What I care jungle thinks? He may dead now.” “Unless drop branches sport, kill idleness, I fear man-cub. He wise well taught, he eyes make Jungle-People afraid. But (and great evil) he power Bandar-log, they, live trees, fear people.” Bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully. “Fool I am! Oh, fat, brown, root-digging fool I am,” said Baloo, uncoiling jerk, “it true Hathi Wild Elephant says: `To his fear’; they, Bandar-log, fear Kaa Rock Snake. He climb well can. He steals young monkeys night. The whisper his name makes wicked tails cold. Let us go Kaa.” “What he us? He tribe, footless--and evil eyes,” said Bagheera. “He old cunning. Above all, he always hungry,” said Baloo hopefully. “Promise many goats.” “He sleeps full month he eaten. He may asleep now, even he awake he would rather kill his goats?” Bagheera, know much Kaa, naturally suspicious. “Then case, thou I together, old hunter, might make see reason.” Here Baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder Panther, went look Kaa Rock Python. They found stretched warm ledge afternoon sun, admiring his beautiful new coat, he retirement last ten days changing his skin, he splendid--darting his big blunt-nosed head along ground, twisting thirty feet his body fantastic knots curves, licking his lips he thought his dinner come. “He eaten,” said Baloo, grunt relief, soon he saw beautifully mottled brown yellow jacket. “Be careful, Bagheera! He always little blind he changed his skin, quick strike.” Kaa poison snake--in fact he rather despised poison snakes cowards--but his strength lay his hug, he lapped his huge coils round anybody said. “Good hunting!” cried Baloo, sitting his haunches. Like snakes his breed Kaa rather deaf, hear call first. Then he curled ready accident, his head lowered. “Good hunting us all,” he answered. “Oho, Baloo, dost thou here? Good hunting, Bagheera. One us least needs food. Is news game afoot? A doe now, even young buck? I empty dried well.” “We hunting,” said Baloo carelessly. He knew must hurry Kaa. He big. “Give permission come you,” said Kaa. “A blow less nothing thee, Bagheera Baloo, I--I wait wait days wood-path climb half night mere chance young ape. Psshaw! The branches I young. Rotten twigs dry boughs all.” “Maybe thy great weight something matter,” said Baloo. “I fair length--a fair length,” said Kaa little pride. “But that, fault new-grown timber. I came near falling last hunt--very near indeed--and noise slipping, tail tight wrapped around tree, waked Bandar-log, called evil names.” “Footless, yellow earth-worm,” said Bagheera his whiskers, though he trying remember something. “Sssss! Have ever called that?” said Kaa. “Something kind shouted us last moon, never noticed them. They say anything--even thou hast lost thy teeth, wilt face anything bigger kid, (they indeed shameless, Bandar-log)--because thou art afraid he-goat’s horns,” Bagheera went sweetly. Now snake, especially wary old python like Kaa, seldom shows he angry, Baloo Bagheera could see big swallowing muscles either side Kaa’s throat ripple bulge. “The Bandar-log shifted grounds,” he said quietly. “When I came sun today I heard whooping among tree-tops.” “It--it Bandar-log follow now,” said Baloo, words stuck his throat, first time his memory one Jungle-People owned interested doings monkeys. “Beyond doubt small thing takes two hunters--leaders jungle I certain--on trail Bandar-log,” Kaa replied courteously, he swelled curiosity. “Indeed,” Baloo began, “I old sometimes foolish Teacher Law Seeonee wolf-cubs, Bagheera here--” “Is Bagheera,” said Black Panther, his jaws shut snap, he believe humble. “The trouble this, Kaa. Those nut-stealers pickers palm leaves stolen away man-cub thou hast perhaps heard.” “I heard news Ikki (his quills make presumptuous) man-thing entered wolf pack, I believe. Ikki full stories half heard badly told.” “But true. He man-cub never was,” said Baloo. “The best wisest boldest man-cubs--my pupil, shall make name Baloo famous jungles; besides, I--we--love him, Kaa.” “Ts! Ts!” said Kaa, weaving his head fro. “I also known love is. There tales I could tell that--” “That need clear night well fed praise properly,” said Bagheera quickly. “Our man-cub hands Bandar-log now, know Jungle-People fear Kaa alone.” “They fear alone. They good reason,” said Kaa. “Chattering, foolish, vain--vain, foolish, chattering, monkeys. But man-thing hands good luck. They grow tired nuts pick, throw down. They carry branch half day, meaning great things it, snap two. That man-thing envied. They called also--`yellow fish’ not?” “Worm--worm--earth-worm,” said Bagheera, “as well things I cannot say shame.” “We must remind speak well master. Aaa-ssp! We must help wandering memories. Now, whither went cub?” “The jungle alone knows. Toward sunset, I believe,” said Baloo. “We thought thou wouldst know, Kaa.” “I? How? I take come way, I hunt Bandar-log, frogs--or green scum water-hole, matter.” “Up, Up! Up, Up! Hillo! Illo! Illo, look up, Baloo Seeonee Wolf Pack!” Baloo looked see voice came from, Rann Kite, sweeping sun shining upturned flanges his wings. It near Rann’s bedtime, he ranged jungle looking Bear missed thick foliage. “What it?” said Baloo. “I seen Mowgli among Bandar-log. He bade tell you. I watched. The Bandar-log taken beyond river monkey city--to Cold Lairs. They may stay night, ten nights, hour. I told bats watch dark time. That message. Good hunting, below!” “Full gorge deep sleep you, Rann,” cried Bagheera. “I remember thee next kill, put aside head thee alone, O best kites!” “It nothing. It nothing. The boy held Master Word. I could done less,” Rann circled his roost. “He forgotten use his tongue,” said Baloo chuckle pride. “To think one young remembering Master Word birds he pulled across trees!” “It firmly driven him,” said Bagheera. “But I proud him, must go Cold Lairs.” They knew place was, Jungle People ever went there, called Cold Lairs old deserted city, lost buried jungle, beasts seldom use place men used. The wild boar will, hunting tribes not. Besides, monkeys lived much could said live anywhere, self-respecting animal would come within eyeshot except times drought, half-ruined tanks reservoirs held little water. “It half night’s journey--at full speed,” said Bagheera, Baloo looked serious. “I go fast I can,” he said anxiously. “We dare wait thee. Follow, Baloo. We must go quick-foot--Kaa I.” “Feet feet, I keep abreast thy four,” said Kaa shortly. Baloo made one effort hurry, sit panting, left come later, Bagheera hurried forward, quick panther-canter. Kaa said nothing, but, strive Bagheera might, huge Rock-python held level him. When came hill stream, Bagheera gained, he bounded across Kaa swam, his head two feet his neck clearing water, level ground Kaa made distance. “By Broken Lock freed me,” said Bagheera, twilight fallen, “thou art slow goer!” “I hungry,” said Kaa. “Besides, called speckled frog.” “Worm--earth-worm, yellow boot.” “All one. Let us go on,” Kaa seemed pour along ground, finding shortest road his steady eyes, keeping it. In Cold Lairs Monkey-People thinking Mowgli’s friends all. They brought boy Lost City, much pleased time. Mowgli never seen Indian city before, though almost heap ruins seemed wonderful splendid. Some king built long ago little hill. You could still trace stone causeways led ruined gates last splinters wood hung worn, rusted hinges. Trees grown walls; battlements tumbled decayed, wild creepers hung windows towers walls bushy hanging clumps. A great roofless palace crowned hill, marble courtyards fountains split, stained red green, cobblestones courtyard king’s elephants used live thrust apart grasses young trees. From palace could see rows rows roofless houses made city looking like empty honeycombs filled blackness; shapeless block stone idol square four roads met; pits dimples street corners public wells stood, shattered domes temples wild figs sprouting sides. The monkeys called place city, pretended despise Jungle-People lived forest. And yet never knew buildings made use them. They would sit circles hall king’s council chamber, scratch fleas pretend men; would run roofless houses collect pieces plaster old bricks corner, forget hidden them, fight cry scuffling crowds, break play terraces king’s garden, would shake rose trees oranges sport see fruit flowers fall. They explored passages dark tunnels palace hundreds little dark rooms, never remembered seen not; drifted ones twos crowds telling men did. They drank tanks made water muddy, fought it, would rush together mobs shout: “There one jungle wise good clever strong gentle Bandar-log.” Then would begin till grew tired city went back tree-tops, hoping Jungle-People would notice them. Mowgli, trained Law Jungle, like understand kind life. The monkeys dragged Cold Lairs late afternoon, instead going sleep, Mowgli would done long journey, joined hands danced sang foolish songs. One monkeys made speech told his companions Mowgli’s capture marked new thing history Bandar-log, Mowgli going show weave sticks canes together protection rain cold. Mowgli picked creepers began work out, monkeys tried imitate; minutes lost interest began pull friends’ tails jump fours, coughing. “I wish eat,” said Mowgli. “I stranger part jungle. Bring food, give leave hunt here.” Twenty thirty monkeys bounded away bring nuts wild pawpaws. But fell fighting road, much trouble go back left fruit. Mowgli sore angry well hungry, he roamed empty city giving Strangers’ Hunting Call time time, one answered him, Mowgli felt he reached bad place indeed. “All Baloo said Bandar-log true,” he thought himself. “They Law, Hunting Call, leaders--nothing foolish words little picking thievish hands. So I starved killed here, fault. But I must try return jungle. Baloo surely beat me, better chasing silly rose leaves Bandar-log.” No sooner he walked city wall monkeys pulled back, telling he know happy he was, pinching make grateful. He set his teeth said nothing, went shouting monkeys terrace red sandstone reservoirs half-full rain water. There ruined summer-house white marble center terrace, built queens dead hundred years ago. The domed roof half fallen blocked underground passage palace queens used enter. But walls made screens marble tracery--beautiful milk-white fretwork, set agates cornelians jasper lapis lazuli, moon came behind hill shone open work, casting shadows ground like black velvet embroidery. Sore, sleepy, hungry he was, Mowgli could help laughing Bandar-log began, twenty time, tell great wise strong gentle were, foolish he wish leave them. “We great. We free. We wonderful. We wonderful people jungle! We say so, must true,” shouted. “Now new listener carry words back Jungle-People may notice us future, tell excellent selves.” Mowgli made objection, monkeys gathered hundreds hundreds terrace listen speakers singing praises Bandar-log, whenever speaker stopped want breath would shout together: “This true; say so.” Mowgli nodded blinked, said “Yes” asked question, his head spun noise. “Tabaqui Jackal must bitten people,” he said himself, “and madness. Certainly dewanee, madness. Do never go sleep? Now cloud coming cover moon. If big enough cloud I might try run away darkness. But I tired.” That cloud watched two good friends ruined ditch city wall, Bagheera Kaa, knowing well dangerous Monkey-People large numbers, wish run risks. The monkeys never fight unless hundred one, jungle care odds. “I go west wall,” Kaa whispered, “and come swiftly slope ground favor. They throw upon back hundreds, but--” “I know it,” said Bagheera. “Would Baloo here, must can. When cloud covers moon I shall go terrace. They hold sort council boy.” “Good hunting,” said Kaa grimly, glided away west wall. That happened least ruined any, big snake delayed awhile he could find way stones. The cloud hid moon, Mowgli wondered would come next he heard Bagheera’s light feet terrace. The Black Panther raced slope almost without sound striking--he knew better waste time biting--right left among monkeys, seated round Mowgli circles fifty sixty deep. There howl fright rage, Bagheera tripped rolling kicking bodies beneath him, monkey shouted: “There one here! Kill him! Kill.” A scuffling mass monkeys, biting, scratching, tearing, pulling, closed Bagheera, five six laid hold Mowgli, dragged wall summerhouse pushed hole broken dome. A man-trained boy would badly bruised, fall good fifteen feet, Mowgli fell Baloo taught fall, landed his feet. “Stay there,” shouted monkeys, “till killed thy friends, later play thee--if Poison-People leave thee alive.” “We one blood, ye I,” said Mowgli, quickly giving Snake’s Call. He could hear rustling hissing rubbish round gave Call second time, make sure. “Even ssso! Down hoods all!” said half dozen low voices (every ruin India becomes sooner later dwelling place snakes, old summerhouse alive cobras). “Stand still, Little Brother, thy feet may us harm.” Mowgli stood quietly he could, peering open work listening furious din fight round Black Panther--the yells chatterings scufflings, Bagheera’s deep, hoarse cough he backed bucked twisted plunged heaps his enemies. For first time since he born, Bagheera fighting his life. “Baloo must hand; Bagheera would come alone,” Mowgli thought. And he called aloud: “To tank, Bagheera. Roll water tanks. Roll plunge! Get water!” Bagheera heard, cry told Mowgli safe gave new courage. He worked his way desperately, inch inch, straight reservoirs, halting silence. Then ruined wall nearest jungle rose rumbling war-shout Baloo. The old Bear done his best, he could come before. “Bagheera,” he shouted, “I here. I climb! I haste! Ahuwora! The stones slip feet! Wait coming, O infamous Bandar-log!” He panted terrace disappear head wave monkeys, he threw squarely his haunches, and, spreading his forepaws, hugged many he could hold, began hit regular bat-bat-bat, like flipping strokes paddle wheel. A crash splash told Mowgli Bagheera fought his way tank monkeys could follow. The Panther lay gasping breath, his head water, monkeys stood three deep red steps, dancing rage, ready spring upon sides he came help Baloo. It Bagheera lifted his dripping chin, despair gave Snake’s Call protection--“We one blood, ye I”--for he believed Kaa turned tail last minute. Even Baloo, half smothered monkeys edge terrace, could help chuckling he heard Black Panther asking help. Kaa worked his way west wall, landing wrench dislodged coping stone ditch. He intention losing advantage ground, coiled uncoiled twice, sure every foot his long body working order. All fight Baloo went on, monkeys yelled tank round Bagheera, Mang Bat, flying fro, carried news great battle jungle, till even Hathi Wild Elephant trumpeted, and, far away, scattered bands Monkey-Folk woke came leaping along tree-roads help comrades Cold Lairs, noise fight roused day birds miles round. Then Kaa came straight, quickly, anxious kill. The fighting strength python driving blow his head backed strength weight his body. If imagine lance, battering ram, hammer weighing nearly half ton driven cool, quiet mind living handle it, roughly imagine Kaa like he fought. A python four five feet long knock man he hits fairly chest, Kaa thirty feet long, know. His first stroke delivered heart crowd round Baloo. It sent home shut mouth silence, need second. The monkeys scattered cries of--“Kaa! It Kaa! Run! Run!” Generations monkeys scared good behavior stories elders told Kaa, night thief, could slip along branches quietly moss grows, steal away strongest monkey ever lived; old Kaa, could make look like dead branch rotten stump wisest deceived, till branch caught them. Kaa everything monkeys feared jungle, none knew limits his power, none could look face, none ever come alive his hug. And ran, stammering terror, walls roofs houses, Baloo drew deep breath relief. His fur much thicker Bagheera’s, he suffered sorely fight. Then Kaa opened his mouth first time spoke one long hissing word, far-away monkeys, hurrying defense Cold Lairs, stayed were, cowering, till loaded branches bent crackled them. The monkeys walls empty houses stopped cries, stillness fell upon city Mowgli heard Bagheera shaking his wet sides he came tank. Then clamor broke again. The monkeys leaped higher walls. They clung around necks big stone idols shrieked skipped along battlements, Mowgli, dancing summerhouse, put his eye screenwork hooted owl-fashion his front teeth, show his derision contempt. “Get man-cub trap; I more,” Bagheera gasped. “Let us take man-cub go. They may attack again.” “They move till I order them. Stay sssso!” Kaa hissed, city silent more. “I could come before, Brother, I think I heard thee call”--this Bagheera. “I--I may cried battle,” Bagheera answered. “Baloo, art thou hurt? “I sure pull hundred little bearlings,” said Baloo, gravely shaking one leg other. “Wow! I sore. Kaa, owe thee, I think, lives--Bagheera I.” “No matter. Where manling?” “Here, trap. I cannot climb out,” cried Mowgli. The curve broken dome his head. “Take away. He dances like Mao Peacock. He crush young,” said cobras inside. “Hah!” said Kaa chuckle, “he friends everywhere, manling. Stand back, manling. And hide you, O Poison People. I break wall.” Kaa looked carefully till he found discolored crack marble tracery showing weak spot, made two three light taps his head get distance, lifting six feet his body clear ground, sent home half dozen full-power smashing blows, nose-first. The screen-work broke fell away cloud dust rubbish, Mowgli leaped opening flung Baloo Bagheera--an arm around big neck. “Art thou hurt?” said Baloo, hugging softly. “I sore, hungry, little bruised. But, oh, handled ye grievously, Brothers! Ye bleed.” “Others also,” said Bagheera, licking his lips looking monkey-dead terrace round tank. “It nothing, nothing, thou art safe, oh, pride little frogs!” whimpered Baloo. “Of shall judge later,” said Bagheera, dry voice Mowgli like. “But Kaa owe battle thou owest thy life. Thank according customs, Mowgli.” Mowgli turned saw great Python’s head swaying foot his own. “So manling,” said Kaa. “Very soft his skin, he unlike Bandar-log. Have care, manling, I mistake thee monkey twilight I newly changed coat.” “We one blood, thou I,” Mowgli answered. “I take life thee tonight. My kill shall thy kill ever thou art hungry, O Kaa.” “All thanks, Little Brother,” said Kaa, though his eyes twinkled. “And may bold hunter kill? I ask I may follow next he goes abroad.” “I kill nothing,--I little,--but I drive goats toward use them. When thou art empty come see I speak truth. I skill [he held his hands], ever thou art trap, I may pay debt I owe thee, Bagheera, Baloo, here. Good hunting ye all, masters.” “Well said,” growled Baloo, Mowgli returned thanks prettily. The Python dropped his head lightly minute Mowgli’s shoulder. “A brave heart courteous tongue,” said he. “They shall carry thee far jungle, manling. But go hence quickly thy friends. Go sleep, moon sets, follows well thou shouldst see.” The moon sinking behind hills lines trembling monkeys huddled together walls battlements looked like ragged shaky fringes things. Baloo went tank drink Bagheera began put his fur order, Kaa glided center terrace brought his jaws together ringing snap drew monkeys’ eyes upon him. “The moon sets,” he said. “Is yet light enough see?” From walls came moan like wind tree-tops--“We see, O Kaa.” “Good. Begins dance--the Dance Hunger Kaa. Sit still watch.” He turned twice thrice big circle, weaving his head right left. Then he began making loops figures eight his body, soft, oozy triangles melted squares five-sided figures, coiled mounds, never resting, never hurrying, never stopping his low humming song. It grew darker darker, till last dragging, shifting coils disappeared, could hear rustle scales. Baloo Bagheera stood still stone, growling throats, neck hair bristling, Mowgli watched wondered. “Bandar-log,” said voice Kaa last, “can ye stir foot hand without order? Speak!” “Without thy order cannot stir foot hand, O Kaa!” “Good! Come one pace nearer me.” The lines monkeys swayed forward helplessly, Baloo Bagheera took one stiff step forward them. “Nearer!” hissed Kaa, moved again. Mowgli laid his hands Baloo Bagheera get away, two great beasts started though waked dream. “Keep thy hand shoulder,” Bagheera whispered. “Keep there, I must go back--must go back Kaa. Aah!” “It old Kaa making circles dust,” said Mowgli. “Let us go.” And three slipped gap walls jungle. “Whoof!” said Baloo, he stood still trees again. “Never I make ally Kaa,” he shook over. “He knows we,” said Bagheera, trembling. “In little time, I stayed, I walked his throat.” “Many walk road moon rises again,” said Baloo. “He good hunting--after his fashion.” “But meaning all?” said Mowgli, know anything python’s powers fascination. “I saw big snake making foolish circles till dark came. And his nose sore. Ho! Ho!” “Mowgli,” said Bagheera angrily, “his nose sore thy account, ears sides paws, Baloo’s neck shoulders bitten thy account. Neither Baloo Bagheera able hunt pleasure many days.” “It nothing,” said Baloo; “we man-cub again.” “True, he cost us heavily time might spent good hunting, wounds, hair--I half plucked along back--and last all, honor. For, remember, Mowgli, I, Black Panther, forced call upon Kaa protection, Baloo I made stupid little birds Hunger Dance. All this, man-cub, came thy playing Bandar-log.” “True, true,” said Mowgli sorrowfully. “I evil man-cub, stomach sad me.” “Mf! What says Law Jungle, Baloo?” Baloo wish bring Mowgli trouble, he could tamper Law, he mumbled: “Sorrow never stays punishment. But remember, Bagheera, he little.” “I remember. But he done mischief, blows must dealt now. Mowgli, hast thou anything say?” “Nothing. I wrong. Baloo thou wounded. It just.” Bagheera gave half dozen love-taps panther’s point view (they would hardly waked one his cubs), seven-year-old boy amounted severe beating could wish avoid. When Mowgli sneezed, picked without word. “Now,” said Bagheera, “jump back, Little Brother, go home.” One beauties Jungle Law punishment settles scores. There nagging afterward. Mowgli laid his head Bagheera’s back slept deeply he never waked he put home-cave. Road-Song Bandar-Log Here go flung festoon, Half-way jealous moon! Do not envy pranceful bands? Do not wish extra hands? Would not like tails were--so-- Curved shape Cupid’s bow? Now you are angry, but--never mind, Brother, thy tail hangs behind! Here sit branchy row, Thinking beautiful things know; Dreaming deeds mean do, All complete, minute two-- Something noble wise good, Done merely wishing could. We have forgotten, but--never mind, Brother, thy tail hangs behind! All talk ever heard Uttered bat beast bird-- Hide fin scale feather-- Jabber quickly together! Excellent! Wonderful! Once again! Now talking like men! Let us pretend ... never mind, Brother, thy tail hangs behind! This way Monkey-kind. Then join leaping lines scumfish pines, That rocket where, light high, wild grape swings. By rubbish wake, noble noise make, Be sure, sure, we are going splendid things! “Tiger! Tiger!” What hunting, hunter bold? Brother, watch long cold. What quarry ye went kill? Brother, he crops jungle still. Where power made pride? Brother, ebbs flank side. Where haste ye hurry by? Brother, I go lair--to die. Now must go back first tale. When Mowgli left wolf’s cave fight Pack Council Rock, he went plowed lands villagers lived, he would stop near jungle, he knew he made least one bad enemy Council. So he hurried on, keeping rough road ran valley, followed steady jog-trot nearly twenty miles, till he came country he know. The valley opened great plain dotted rocks cut ravines. At one end stood little village, thick jungle came sweep grazing-grounds, stopped though cut hoe. All plain, cattle buffaloes grazing, little boys charge herds saw Mowgli shouted ran away, yellow pariah dogs hang every Indian village barked. Mowgli walked on, he feeling hungry, he came village gate he saw big thorn-bush drawn gate twilight, pushed one side. “Umph!” he said, he come across one barricade his night rambles things eat. “So men afraid People Jungle also.” He sat gate, man came he stood up, opened his mouth, pointed show he wanted food. The man stared, ran back one street village shouting priest, big, fat man dressed white, red yellow mark his forehead. The priest came gate, least hundred people, stared talked shouted pointed Mowgli. “They manners, Men Folk,” said Mowgli himself. “Only gray ape would behave do.” So he threw back his long hair frowned crowd. “What afraid of?” said priest. “Look marks his arms legs. They bites wolves. He wolf-child run away jungle.” Of course, playing together, cubs often nipped Mowgli harder intended, white scars his arms legs. But he would last person world call bites, he knew real biting meant. “Arre! Arre!” said two three women together. “To bitten wolves, poor child! He handsome boy. He eyes like red fire. By honor, Messua, he unlike thy boy taken tiger.” “Let look,” said woman heavy copper rings her wrists ankles, she peered Mowgli palm her hand. “Indeed he not. He thinner, he look boy.” The priest clever man, he knew Messua wife richest villager place. So he looked sky minute said solemnly: “What jungle taken jungle restored. Take boy thy house, sister, forget honor priest sees far lives men.” “By Bull bought me,” said Mowgli himself, “but talking like another looking-over Pack! Well, I man, man I must become.” The crowd parted woman beckoned Mowgli her hut, red lacquered bedstead, great earthen grain chest funny raised patterns it, half dozen copper cooking pots, image Hindu god little alcove, wall real looking glass, sell country fairs. She gave long drink milk bread, she laid her hand his head looked his eyes; she thought perhaps he might her real son come back jungle tiger taken him. So she said, “Nathoo, O Nathoo!” Mowgli show he knew name. “Dost thou remember day I gave thee thy new shoes?” She touched his foot, almost hard horn. “No,” she said sorrowfully, “those feet never worn shoes, thou art like Nathoo, thou shalt son.” Mowgli uneasy, he never roof before. But he looked thatch, he saw he could tear time he wanted get away, window fastenings. “What good man,” he said last, “if he understand man’s talk? Now I silly dumb man would us jungle. I must speak talk.” It fun he learned he wolves imitate challenge bucks jungle grunt little wild pig. So, soon Messua pronounced word Mowgli would imitate almost perfectly, dark he learned names many things hut. There difficulty bedtime, Mowgli would sleep anything looked like panther trap hut, shut door he went window. “Give his will,” said Messua’s husband. “Remember he never till slept bed. If he indeed sent place son he run away.” So Mowgli stretched long, clean grass edge field, he closed his eyes soft gray nose poked chin. “Phew!” said Gray Brother (he eldest Mother Wolf’s cubs). “This poor reward following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest wood smoke cattle--altogether like man already. Wake, Little Brother; I bring news.” “Are well jungle?” said Mowgli, hugging him. “All except wolves burned Red Flower. Now, listen. Shere Khan gone away hunt far till his coat grows again, he badly singed. When he returns he swears he lay thy bones Waingunga.” “There two words that. I also made little promise. But news always good. I tired to-night,--very tired new things, Gray Brother,--but bring news always.” “Thou wilt forget thou art wolf? Men make thee forget?” said Gray Brother anxiously. “Never. I always remember I love thee cave. But also I always remember I cast Pack.” “And thou mayest cast another pack. Men men, Little Brother, talk like talk frogs pond. When I come again, I wait thee bamboos edge grazing-ground.” For three months night Mowgli hardly ever left village gate, he busy learning ways customs men. First he wear cloth round him, annoyed horribly; he learn money, he least understand, plowing, he see use. Then little children village made angry. Luckily, Law Jungle taught keep his temper, jungle life food depend keeping temper; made fun he would play games fly kites, he mispronounced word, knowledge unsportsmanlike kill little naked cubs kept picking breaking two. He know his strength least. In jungle he knew he weak compared beasts, village people said he strong bull. And Mowgli faintest idea difference caste makes man man. When potter’s donkey slipped clay pit, Mowgli hauled tail, helped stack pots journey market Khanhiwara. That shocking, too, potter low-caste man, his donkey worse. When priest scolded him, Mowgli threatened put donkey too, priest told Messua’s husband Mowgli better set work soon possible; village head-man told Mowgli he would go buffaloes next day, herd grazed. No one pleased Mowgli; night, he appointed servant village, were, he went circle met every evening masonry platform great fig-tree. It village club, head-man watchman barber, knew gossip village, old Buldeo, village hunter, Tower musket, met smoked. The monkeys sat talked upper branches, hole platform cobra lived, he his little platter milk every night he sacred; old men sat around tree talked, pulled big huqas (the water-pipes) till far night. They told wonderful tales gods men ghosts; Buldeo told even wonderful ones ways beasts jungle, till eyes children sitting outside circle bulged heads. Most tales animals, jungle always door. The deer wild pig grubbed crops, tiger carried man twilight, within sight village gates. Mowgli, naturally knew something talking of, cover his face show he laughing, Buldeo, Tower musket across his knees, climbed one wonderful story another, Mowgli’s shoulders shook. Buldeo explaining tiger carried away Messua’s son ghost-tiger, his body inhabited ghost wicked, old money-lender, died years ago. “And I know true,” he said, “because Purun Dass always limped blow he got riot his account books burned, tiger I speak he limps, too, tracks his pads unequal.” “True, true, must truth,” said gray-beards, nodding together. “Are tales cobwebs moon talk?” said Mowgli. “That tiger limps he born lame, everyone knows. To talk soul money-lender beast never courage jackal child’s talk.” Buldeo speechless surprise moment, head-man stared. “Oho! It jungle brat, it?” said Buldeo. “If thou art wise, better bring his hide Khanhiwara, Government set hundred rupees his life. Better still, talk thy elders speak.” Mowgli rose go. “All evening I lain listening,” he called back his shoulder, “and, except twice, Buldeo said one word truth concerning jungle, his doors. How, then, shall I believe tales ghosts gods goblins he says he seen?” “It full time boy went herding,” said head-man, Buldeo puffed snorted Mowgli’s impertinence. The custom Indian villages boys take cattle buffaloes graze early morning, bring back night. The cattle would trample white man death allow banged bullied shouted children hardly come noses. So long boys keep herds safe, even tiger charge mob cattle. But straggle pick flowers hunt lizards, sometimes carried off. Mowgli went village street dawn, sitting back Rama, great herd bull. The slaty-blue buffaloes, long, backward-sweeping horns savage eyes, rose byres, one one, followed him, Mowgli made clear children he master. He beat buffaloes long, polished bamboo, told Kamya, one boys, graze cattle themselves, he went buffaloes, careful stray away herd. An Indian grazing ground rocks scrub tussocks little ravines, among herds scatter disappear. The buffaloes generally keep pools muddy places, lie wallowing basking warm mud hours. Mowgli drove edge plain Waingunga came jungle; he dropped Rama’s neck, trotted bamboo clump, found Gray Brother. “Ah,” said Gray Brother, “I waited many days. What meaning cattle-herding work?” “It order,” said Mowgli. “I village herd while. What news Shere Khan?” “He come back country, waited long time thee. Now he gone again, game scarce. But he means kill thee.” “Very good,” said Mowgli. “So long he away thou one four brothers sit rock, I see thee I come village. When he comes back wait ravine dhak tree center plain. We need walk Shere Khan’s mouth.” Then Mowgli picked shady place, lay slept buffaloes grazed round him. Herding India one laziest things world. The cattle move crunch, lie down, move again, even low. They grunt, buffaloes seldom say anything, get muddy pools one another, work way mud till noses staring china-blue eyes show surface, lie like logs. The sun makes rocks dance heat, herd children hear one kite (never more) whistling almost sight overhead, know died, cow died, kite would sweep down, next kite miles away would see drop follow, next, next, almost dead would score hungry kites come nowhere. Then sleep wake sleep again, weave little baskets dried grass put grasshoppers them; catch two praying mantises make fight; string necklace red black jungle nuts; watch lizard basking rock, snake hunting frog near wallows. Then sing long, long songs odd native quavers end them, day seems longer people’s whole lives, perhaps make mud castle mud figures men horses buffaloes, put reeds men’s hands, pretend kings figures armies, gods worshiped. Then evening comes children call, buffaloes lumber sticky mud noises like gunshots going one other, string across gray plain back twinkling village lights. Day day Mowgli would lead buffaloes wallows, day day he would see Gray Brother’s back mile half away across plain (so he knew Shere Khan come back), day day he would lie grass listening noises round him, dreaming old days jungle. If Shere Khan made false step his lame paw jungles Waingunga, Mowgli would heard long, still mornings. At last day came he see Gray Brother signal place, he laughed headed buffaloes ravine dhk tree, covered golden-red flowers. There sat Gray Brother, every bristle his back lifted. “He hidden month throw thee thy guard. He crossed ranges last night Tabaqui, hot-foot thy trail,” said Wolf, panting. Mowgli frowned. “I afraid Shere Khan, Tabaqui cunning.” “Have fear,” said Gray Brother, licking his lips little. “I met Tabaqui dawn. Now he telling his wisdom kites, he told everything I broke his back. Shere Khan’s plan wait thee village gate evening--for thee one else. He lying now, big dry ravine Waingunga.” “Has he eaten today, he hunt empty?” said Mowgli, answer meant life death him. “He killed dawn,--a pig,--and he drunk too. Remember, Shere Khan could never fast, even sake revenge.” “Oh! Fool, fool! What cub’s cub is! Eaten drunk too, he thinks I shall wait till he slept! Now, he lie up? If ten us might pull he lies. These buffaloes charge unless wind him, I cannot speak language. Can get behind his track may smell it?” “He swam far Waingunga cut off,” said Gray Brother. “Tabaqui told that, I know. He would never thought alone.” Mowgli stood his finger his mouth, thinking. “The big ravine Waingunga. That opens plain half mile here. I take herd round jungle head ravine sweep down--but he would slink foot. We must block end. Gray Brother, canst thou cut herd two me?” “Not I, perhaps--but I brought wise helper.” Gray Brother trotted dropped hole. Then lifted huge gray head Mowgli knew well, hot air filled desolate cry jungle--the hunting howl wolf midday. “Akela! Akela!” said Mowgli, clapping his hands. “I might known thou wouldst forget me. We big work hand. Cut herd two, Akela. Keep cows calves together, bulls plow buffaloes themselves.” The two wolves ran, ladies’-chain fashion, herd, snorted threw head, separated two clumps. In one, cow-buffaloes stood calves center, glared pawed, ready, wolf would stay still, charge trample life him. In other, bulls young bulls snorted stamped, though looked imposing much less dangerous, calves protect. No six men could divided herd neatly. “What orders!” panted Akela. “They trying join again.” Mowgli slipped Rama’s back. “Drive bulls away left, Akela. Gray Brother, gone, hold cows together, drive foot ravine.” “How far?” said Gray Brother, panting snapping. “Till sides higher Shere Khan jump,” shouted Mowgli. “Keep till come down.” The bulls swept Akela bayed, Gray Brother stopped front cows. They charged him, he ran foot ravine, Akela drove bulls far left. “Well done! Another charge fairly started. Careful, now--careful, Akela. A snap much bulls charge. Hujah! This wilder work driving black-buck. Didst thou think creatures could move swiftly?” Mowgli called. “I have--have hunted time,” gasped Akela dust. “Shall I turn jungle?” “Ay! Turn. Swiftly turn them! Rama mad rage. Oh, I could tell I need to-day.” The bulls turned, right time, crashed standing thicket. The herd children, watching cattle half mile away, hurried village fast legs could carry them, crying buffaloes gone mad run away. But Mowgli’s plan simple enough. All he wanted make big circle uphill get head ravine, take bulls catch Shere Khan bulls cows; he knew meal full drink Shere Khan would condition fight clamber sides ravine. He soothing buffaloes voice, Akela dropped far rear, whimpering twice hurry rear-guard. It long, long circle, wish get near ravine give Shere Khan warning. At last Mowgli rounded bewildered herd head ravine grassy patch sloped steeply ravine itself. From height could see across tops trees plain below; Mowgli looked sides ravine, he saw great deal satisfaction ran nearly straight down, vines creepers hung would give foothold tiger wanted get out. “Let breathe, Akela,” he said, holding his hand. “They winded yet. Let breathe. I must tell Shere Khan comes. We trap.” He put his hands his mouth shouted ravine--it almost like shouting tunnel--and echoes jumped rock rock. After long time came back drawling, sleepy snarl full-fed tiger wakened. “Who calls?” said Shere Khan, splendid peacock fluttered ravine screeching. “I, Mowgli. Cattle thief, time come Council Rock! Down--hurry down, Akela! Down, Rama, down!” The herd paused instant edge slope, Akela gave tongue full hunting-yell, pitched one other, steamers shoot rapids, sand stones spurting round them. Once started, chance stopping, fairly bed ravine Rama winded Shere Khan bellowed. “Ha! Ha!” said Mowgli, his back. “Now thou knowest!” torrent black horns, foaming muzzles, staring eyes whirled ravine boulders go floodtime; weaker buffaloes shouldered sides ravine tore creepers. They knew business them--the terrible charge buffalo herd tiger hope stand. Shere Khan heard thunder hoofs, picked up, lumbered ravine, looking side side way escape, walls ravine straight he hold on, heavy his dinner his drink, willing anything rather fight. The herd splashed pool he left, bellowing till narrow cut rang. Mowgli heard answering bellow foot ravine, saw Shere Khan turn (the tiger knew worst came worst better meet bulls cows calves), Rama tripped, stumbled, went something soft, and, bulls his heels, crashed full herd, weaker buffaloes lifted clean feet shock meeting. That charge carried herds plain, goring stamping snorting. Mowgli watched his time, slipped Rama’s neck, laying right left his stick. “Quick, Akela! Break up. Scatter them, fighting one another. Drive away, Akela. Hai, Rama! Hai, hai, hai! children. Softly now, softly! It over.” Akela Gray Brother ran fro nipping buffaloes’ legs, though herd wheeled charge ravine again, Mowgli managed turn Rama, others followed wallows. Shere Khan needed trampling. He dead, kites coming already. “Brothers, dog’s death,” said Mowgli, feeling knife he always carried sheath round his neck he lived men. “But he would never shown fight. His hide look well Council Rock. We must get work swiftly.” A boy trained among men would never dreamed skinning ten-foot tiger alone, Mowgli knew better anyone else animal’s skin fitted on, taken off. But hard work, Mowgli slashed tore grunted hour, wolves lolled tongues, came forward tugged he ordered them. Presently hand fell his shoulder, looking he saw Buldeo Tower musket. The children told village buffalo stampede, Buldeo went angrily, anxious correct Mowgli taking better care herd. The wolves dropped sight soon saw man coming. “What folly?” said Buldeo angrily. “To think thou canst skin tiger! Where buffaloes kill him? It Lame Tiger too, hundred rupees his head. Well, well, overlook thy letting herd run off, perhaps I give thee one rupees reward I taken skin Khanhiwara.” He fumbled his waist cloth flint steel, stooped singe Shere Khan’s whiskers. Most native hunters always singe tiger’s whiskers prevent his ghost haunting them. “Hum!” said Mowgli, half he ripped back skin forepaw. “So thou wilt take hide Khanhiwara reward, perhaps give one rupee? Now mind I need skin use. Heh! Old man, take away fire!” “What talk chief hunter village? Thy luck stupidity thy buffaloes helped thee kill. The tiger fed, he would gone twenty miles time. Thou canst even skin properly, little beggar brat, forsooth I, Buldeo, must told singe his whiskers. Mowgli, I give thee one anna reward, big beating. Leave carcass!” “By Bull bought me,” said Mowgli, trying get shoulder, “must I stay babbling old ape noon? Here, Akela, man plagues me.” Buldeo, still stooping Shere Khan’s head, found sprawling grass, gray wolf standing him, Mowgli went skinning though he alone India. “Ye-es,” he said, his teeth. “Thou art altogether right, Buldeo. Thou wilt never give one anna reward. There old war lame tiger myself--a old war, and--I won.” To Buldeo justice, he ten years younger he would taken his chance Akela he met wolf woods, wolf obeyed orders boy private wars man-eating tigers common animal. It sorcery, magic worst kind, thought Buldeo, he wondered whether amulet round his neck would protect him. He lay still still, expecting every minute see Mowgli turn tiger too. “Maharaj! Great King,” he said last husky whisper. “Yes,” said Mowgli, without turning his head, chuckling little. “I old man. I know thou wast anything herdsboy. May I rise go away, thy servant tear pieces?” “Go, peace go thee. Only, another time meddle game. Let go, Akela.” Buldeo hobbled away village fast he could, looking back his shoulder case Mowgli change something terrible. When he got village he told tale magic enchantment sorcery made priest look grave. Mowgli went his work, nearly twilight he wolves drawn great gay skin clear body. “Now must hide take buffaloes home! Help herd them, Akela.” The herd rounded misty twilight, got near village Mowgli saw lights, heard conches bells temple blowing banging. Half village seemed waiting gate. “That I killed Shere Khan,” he said himself. But shower stones whistled his ears, villagers shouted: “Sorcerer! Wolf’s brat! Jungle demon! Go away! Get hence quickly priest turn thee wolf again. Shoot, Buldeo, shoot!” The old Tower musket went bang, young buffalo bellowed pain. “More sorcery!” shouted villagers. “He turn bullets. Buldeo, thy buffalo.” “Now this?” said Mowgli, bewildered, stones flew thicker. “They unlike Pack, brothers thine,” said Akela, sitting composedly. “It head that, bullets mean anything, would cast thee out.” “Wolf! Wolf’s cub! Go away!” shouted priest, waving sprig sacred tulsi plant. “Again? Last time I man. This time I wolf. Let us go, Akela.” A woman--it Messua--ran across herd, cried: “Oh, son, son! They say thou art sorcerer turn beast will. I believe, go away kill thee. Buldeo says thou art wizard, I know thou hast avenged Nathoo’s death.” “Come back, Messua!” shouted crowd. “Come back, stone thee.” Mowgli laughed little short ugly laugh, stone hit mouth. “Run back, Messua. This one foolish tales tell big tree dusk. I least paid thy son’s life. Farewell; run quickly, I shall send herd swiftly brickbats. I wizard, Messua. Farewell!” “Now, more, Akela,” he cried. “Bring herd in.” The buffaloes anxious enough get village. They hardly needed Akela’s yell, charged gate like whirlwind, scattering crowd right left. “Keep count!” shouted Mowgli scornfully. “It may I stolen one them. Keep count, I herding more. Fare well, children men, thank Messua I come wolves hunt street.” He turned his heel walked away Lone Wolf, he looked stars he felt happy. “No sleeping traps me, Akela. Let us get Shere Khan’s skin go away. No, hurt village, Messua kind me.” When moon rose plain, making look milky, horrified villagers saw Mowgli, two wolves his heels bundle his head, trotting across steady wolf’s trot eats long miles like fire. Then banged temple bells blew conches louder ever. And Messua cried, Buldeo embroidered story his adventures jungle, till he ended saying Akela stood his hind legs talked like man. The moon going Mowgli two wolves came hill Council Rock, stopped Mother Wolf’s cave. “They cast Man-Pack, Mother,” shouted Mowgli, “but I come hide Shere Khan keep word.” Mother Wolf walked stiffly cave cubs behind her, her eyes glowed she saw skin. “I told day, he crammed his head shoulders cave, hunting thy life, Little Frog--I told hunter would hunted. It well done.” “Little Brother, well done,” said deep voice thicket. “We lonely jungle without thee,” Bagheera came running Mowgli’s bare feet. They clambered Council Rock together, Mowgli spread skin flat stone Akela used sit, pegged four slivers bamboo, Akela lay upon it, called old call Council, “Look--look well, O Wolves,” exactly he called Mowgli first brought there. Ever since Akela deposed, Pack without leader, hunting fighting pleasure. But answered call habit; lame traps fallen into, limped shot wounds, mangy eating bad food, many missing. But came Council Rock, left them, saw Shere Khan’s striped hide rock, huge claws dangling end empty dangling feet. It Mowgli made song came his throat itself, he shouted aloud, leaping rattling skin, beating time his heels till he breath left, Gray Brother Akela howled verses. “Look well, O Wolves. Have I kept word?” said Mowgli. And wolves bayed “Yes,” one tattered wolf howled: “Lead us again, O Akela. Lead us again, O Man-cub, sick lawlessness, would Free People more.” “Nay,” purred Bagheera, “that may be. When ye full-fed, madness may come upon again. Not nothing ye called Free People. Ye fought freedom, yours. Eat it, O Wolves.” “Man-Pack Wolf-Pack cast out,” said Mowgli. “Now I hunt alone jungle.” “And hunt thee,” said four cubs. So Mowgli went away hunted four cubs jungle day on. But he always alone, because, years afterward, he became man married. But story grown-ups. Mowgli’s Song THAT HE SANG AT THE COUNCIL ROCK WHEN HE DANCED ON SHERE KHAN’S HIDE The Song Mowgli--I, Mowgli, singing. Let jungle listen things I done. Shere Khan said he would kill--would kill! At gates twilight he would kill Mowgli, Frog! He ate he drank. Drink deep, Shere Khan, wilt thou drink again? Sleep dream kill. I alone grazing-grounds. Gray Brother, come me! Come me, Lone Wolf, big game afoot! Bring great bull buffaloes, blue-skinned herd bulls angry eyes. Drive fro I order. Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan? Wake, oh, wake! Here come I, bulls behind. Rama, King Buffaloes, stamped his foot. Waters Waingunga, whither went Shere Khan? He Ikki dig holes, Mao, Peacock, he fly. He Mang Bat, hang branches. Little bamboos creak together, tell he ran? Ow! He there. Ahoo! He there. Under feet Rama lies Lame One! Up, Shere Khan! Up kill! Here meat; break necks bulls! Hsh! He asleep. We wake him, his strength great. The kites come see it. The black ants come know it. There great assembly his honor. Alala! I cloth wrap me. The kites see I naked. I ashamed meet people. Lend thy coat, Shere Khan. Lend thy gay striped coat I may go Council Rock. By Bull bought I made promise--a little promise. Only thy coat lacking I keep word. With knife, knife men use, knife hunter, I stoop gift. Waters Waingunga, Shere Khan gives his coat love he bears me. Pull, Gray Brother! Pull, Akela! Heavy hide Shere Khan. The Man Pack angry. They throw stones talk child’s talk. My mouth bleeding. Let run away. Through night, hot night, run swiftly me, brothers. We leave lights village go low moon. Waters Waingunga, Man-Pack cast out. I harm, afraid me. Why? Wolf Pack, ye cast too. The jungle shut village gates shut. Why? As Mang flies beasts birds, fly I village jungle. Why? I dance hide Shere Khan, heart heavy. My mouth cut wounded stones village, heart light, I come back jungle. Why? These two things fight together snakes fight spring. The water comes eyes; yet I laugh falls. Why? I two Mowglis, hide Shere Khan feet. All jungle knows I killed Shere Khan. Look--look well, O Wolves! Ahae! My heart heavy things I understand. The White Seal Oh! hush thee, baby, night behind us, And black waters sparkled green. The moon, combers, looks downward find us At rest hollows rustle between. Where billow meets billow, soft thy pillow, Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl thy ease! The storm shall wake thee, shark overtake thee, Asleep arms slow-swinging seas! Seal Lullaby All things happened several years ago place called Novastoshnah, North East Point, Island St. Paul, away away Bering Sea. Limmershin, Winter Wren, told tale he blown rigging steamer going Japan, I took cabin warmed fed couple days till he fit fly back St. Paul’s again. Limmershin quaint little bird, he knows tell truth. Nobody comes Novastoshnah except business, people regular business seals. They come summer months hundreds hundreds thousands cold gray sea. For Novastoshnah Beach finest accommodation seals place world. Sea Catch knew that, every spring would swim whatever place he happened in--would swim like torpedo-boat straight Novastoshnah spend month fighting his companions good place rocks, close sea possible. Sea Catch fifteen years old, huge gray fur seal almost mane his shoulders, long, wicked dog teeth. When he heaved his front flippers he stood four feet clear ground, his weight, anyone bold enough weigh him, nearly seven hundred pounds. He scarred marks savage fights, he always ready one fight more. He would put his head one side, though he afraid look his enemy face; he would shoot like lightning, big teeth firmly fixed seal’s neck, seal might get away he could, Sea Catch would help him. Yet Sea Catch never chased beaten seal, Rules Beach. He wanted room sea his nursery. But forty fifty thousand seals hunting thing spring, whistling, bellowing, roaring, blowing beach something frightful. From little hill called Hutchinson’s Hill, could look three half miles ground covered fighting seals; surf dotted heads seals hurrying land begin share fighting. They fought breakers, fought sand, fought smooth-worn basalt rocks nurseries, stupid unaccommodating men. Their wives never came island late May early June, care torn pieces; young two-, three-, four-year-old seals begun housekeeping went inland half mile ranks fighters played sand dunes droves legions, rubbed every single green thing grew. They called holluschickie--the bachelors--and perhaps two three hundred thousand Novastoshnah alone. Sea Catch finished his forty-fifth fight one spring Matkah, his soft, sleek, gentle-eyed wife, came sea, he caught her scruff neck dumped her his reservation, saying gruffly: “Late usual. Where been?” It fashion Sea Catch eat anything four months he stayed beaches, his temper generally bad. Matkah knew better answer back. She looked round cooed: “How thoughtful you. You have taken old place again.” “I think I had,” said Sea Catch. “Look me!” He scratched bleeding twenty places; one eye almost out, his sides torn ribbons. “Oh, men, men!” Matkah said, fanning herself her hind flipper. “Why cannot sensible settle places quietly? You look though fighting Killer Whale.” “I have not anything fight since middle May. The beach disgracefully crowded season. I have met least hundred seals Lukannon Beach, house hunting. Why cannot people stay belong?” “I have often thought much happier hauled Otter Island instead crowded place,” said Matkah. “Bah! Only holluschickie go Otter Island. If went would say afraid. We must preserve appearances, dear.” Sea Catch sunk his head proudly his fat shoulders pretended go sleep minutes, time he keeping sharp lookout fight. Now seals wives land, could hear clamor miles sea loudest gales. At lowest counting million seals beach--old seals, mother seals, tiny babies, holluschickie, fighting, scuffling, bleating, crawling, playing together--going sea coming gangs regiments, lying every foot ground far eye could reach, skirmishing brigades fog. It nearly always foggy Novastoshnah, except sun comes makes everything look pearly rainbow-colored little while. Kotick, Matkah’s baby, born middle confusion, he head shoulders, pale, watery blue eyes, tiny seals must be, something his coat made his mother look closely. “Sea Catch,” she said, last, “our baby’s going white!” “Empty clam-shells dry seaweed!” snorted Sea Catch. “There never thing world white seal.” “I cannot help that,” said Matkah; “there is going now.” And she sang low, crooning seal song mother seals sing babies: You must not swim till you are six weeks old, Or head sunk heels; And summer gales Killer Whales Are bad baby seals. Are bad baby seals, dear rat, As bad bad be; But splash grow strong, And cannot wrong. Child Open Sea! Of course little fellow understand words first. He paddled scrambled his mother’s side, learned scuffle way his father fighting another seal, two rolled roared slippery rocks. Matkah used go sea get things eat, baby fed two days, he ate he could throve upon it. The first thing he crawl inland, he met tens thousands babies his age, played together like puppies, went sleep clean sand, played again. The old people nurseries took notice them, holluschickie kept grounds, babies beautiful playtime. When Matkah came back her deep-sea fishing she would go straight playground call sheep calls lamb, wait she heard Kotick bleat. Then she would take straightest straight lines his direction, striking her fore flippers knocking youngsters head heels right left. There always hundred mothers hunting children playgrounds, babies kept lively. But, Matkah told Kotick, “So long do not lie muddy water get mange, rub hard sand cut scratch, long never go swimming heavy sea, nothing hurt here.” Little seals swim little children, unhappy till learn. The first time Kotick went sea wave carried beyond his depth, his big head sank his little hind flippers flew exactly his mother told song, next wave thrown back he would drowned. After that, he learned lie beach pool let wash waves cover lift he paddled, he always kept his eye open big waves might hurt. He two weeks learning use his flippers; he floundered water, coughed grunted crawled beach took catnaps sand, went back again, last he found he truly belonged water. Then imagine times he his companions, ducking rollers; coming top comber landing swash splutter big wave went whirling far beach; standing his tail scratching his head old people did; playing “I am King Castle” slippery, weedy rocks stuck wash. Now he would see thin fin, like big shark’s fin, drifting along close shore, he knew Killer Whale, Grampus, eats young seals he get them; Kotick would head beach like arrow, fin would jig slowly, looking nothing all. Late October seals began leave St. Paul’s deep sea, families tribes, fighting nurseries, holluschickie played anywhere liked. “Next year,” said Matkah Kotick, “you holluschickie; year must learn catch fish.” They set together across Pacific, Matkah showed Kotick sleep his back his flippers tucked his side his little nose water. No cradle comfortable long, rocking swell Pacific. When Kotick felt his skin tingle over, Matkah told he learning “feel water,” tingly, prickly feelings meant bad weather coming, he must swim hard get away. “In little time,” she said, “you will know swim to, we will follow Sea Pig, Porpoise, he wise.” A school porpoises ducking tearing water, little Kotick followed fast he could. “How know go to?” he panted. The leader school rolled his white eye ducked under. “My tail tingles, youngster,” he said. “That means there is gale behind me. Come along! When you are south Sticky Water [he meant Equator] tail tingles, means there is gale front must head north. Come along! The water feels bad here.” This one many things Kotick learned, he always learning. Matkah taught follow cod halibut along under-sea banks wrench rockling his hole among weeds; skirt wrecks lying hundred fathoms water dart like rifle bullet one porthole another fishes ran; dance top waves lightning racing sky, wave his flipper politely stumpy-tailed Albatross Man-of-war Hawk went wind; jump three four feet clear water like dolphin, flippers close side tail curved; leave flying fish alone bony; take shoulder-piece cod full speed ten fathoms deep, never stop look boat ship, particularly row-boat. At end six months Kotick know deep-sea fishing worth knowing. And time he never set flipper dry ground. One day, however, he lying half asleep warm water somewhere Island Juan Fernandez, he felt faint lazy over, human people spring legs, he remembered good firm beaches Novastoshnah seven thousand miles away, games his companions played, smell seaweed, seal roar, fighting. That minute he turned north, swimming steadily, he went he met scores his mates, bound place, said: “Greeting, Kotick! This year holluschickie, dance Fire-dance breakers Lukannon play new grass. But get coat?” Kotick’s fur almost pure white now, though he felt proud it, he said, “Swim quickly! My bones aching land.” And came beaches born, heard old seals, fathers, fighting rolling mist. That night Kotick danced Fire-dance yearling seals. The sea full fire summer nights way Novastoshnah Lukannon, seal leaves wake like burning oil behind flaming flash he jumps, waves break great phosphorescent streaks swirls. Then went inland holluschickie grounds rolled new wild wheat told stories done sea. They talked Pacific boys would talk wood nutting in, anyone understood he could gone away made chart ocean never was. The three- four-year-old holluschickie romped Hutchinson’s Hill crying: “Out way, youngsters! The sea deep do not know that is yet. Wait till you have rounded Horn. Hi, yearling, get white coat?” “I did not get it,” said Kotick. “It grew.” And he going roll speaker over, couple black-haired men flat red faces came behind sand dune, Kotick, never seen man before, coughed lowered his head. The holluschickie bundled yards sat staring stupidly. The men less Kerick Booterin, chief seal-hunters island, Patalamon, his son. They came little village half mile sea nurseries, deciding seals would drive killing pens--for seals driven like sheep--to turned seal-skin jackets later on. “Ho!” said Patalamon. “Look! There is white seal!” Kerick Booterin turned nearly white his oil smoke, he Aleut, Aleuts clean people. Then he began mutter prayer. “Do not touch him, Patalamon. There never white seal since--since I born. Perhaps old Zaharrof’s ghost. He lost last year big gale.” “I am going near him,” said Patalamon. “He is unlucky. Do really think he old Zaharrof come back? I owe gulls’ eggs.” “Do not look him,” said Kerick. “Head drove four-year-olds. The men ought skin two hundred to-day, it is beginning season new work. A hundred do. Quick!” Patalamon rattled pair seal’s shoulder bones front herd holluschickie stopped dead, puffing blowing. Then he stepped near seals began move, Kerick headed inland, never tried get back companions. Hundreds hundreds thousands seals watched driven, went playing same. Kotick one asked questions, none his companions could tell anything, except men always drove seals way six weeks two months every year. “I going follow,” he said, his eyes nearly popped his head he shuffled along wake herd. “The white seal coming us,” cried Patalamon. “That is first time seal ever come killing-grounds alone.” “Hsh! Do not look behind you,” said Kerick. “It Zaharrof’s ghost! I must speak priest this.” The distance killing-grounds half mile, took hour cover, seals went fast Kerick knew would get heated fur would come patches skinned. So went slowly, past Sea Lion’s Neck, past Webster House, till came Salt House beyond sight seals beach. Kotick followed, panting wondering. He thought he world’s end, roar seal nurseries behind sounded loud roar train tunnel. Then Kerick sat moss pulled heavy pewter watch let drove cool thirty minutes, Kotick could hear fog-dew dripping brim his cap. Then ten twelve men, iron-bound club three four feet long, came up, Kerick pointed one two drove bitten companions hot, men kicked aside heavy boots made skin walrus’s throat, Kerick said, “Let go!” men clubbed seals head fast could. Ten minutes later little Kotick recognize his friends more, skins ripped nose hind flippers, whipped thrown ground pile. That enough Kotick. He turned galloped (a seal gallop swiftly short time) back sea; his little new mustache bristling horror. At Sea Lion’s Neck, great sea lions sit edge surf, he flung flipper-overhead cool water rocked there, gasping miserably. “What is here?” said sea lion gruffly, rule sea lions keep themselves. “Scoochnie! Ochen scoochnie!” (“I am lonesome, lonesome!”) said Kotick. “They are killing holluschickie beaches!” The Sea Lion turned his head inshore. “Nonsense!” he said. “Your friends making much noise ever. You must seen old Kerick polishing drove. He is done thirty years.” “It is horrible,” said Kotick, backing water wave went him, steadying screw stroke his flippers brought standing within three inches jagged edge rock. “Well done yearling!” said Sea Lion, could appreciate good swimming. “I suppose rather awful way looking it, seals come year year, course men get know it, unless find island men ever come always driven.” “Is not island?” began Kotick. “I have followed poltoos [the halibut] twenty years, I cannot say I have found yet. But look here--you seem fondness talking betters--suppose go Walrus Islet talk Sea Vitch. He may know something. Do not flounce like that. It is six-mile swim, I I haul take nap first, little one.” Kotick thought good advice, he swam round his beach, hauled out, slept half hour, twitching over, seals will. Then he headed straight Walrus Islet, little low sheet rocky island almost due northeast Novastoshnah, ledges rock gulls’ nests, walrus herded themselves. He landed close old Sea Vitch--the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat-necked, long-tusked walrus North Pacific, manners except he asleep--as he then, his hind flippers half half surf. “Wake up!” barked Kotick, gulls making great noise. “Hah! Ho! Hmph! What is that?” said Sea Vitch, he struck next walrus blow his tusks waked up, next struck next, till awake staring every direction right one. “Hi! It is me,” said Kotick, bobbing surf looking like little white slug. “Well! May I be--skinned!” said Sea Vitch, looked Kotick fancy club full drowsy old gentlemen would look little boy. Kotick care hear skinning then; he seen enough it. So he called out: “Is not place seals go men do not ever come?” “Go find out,” said Sea Vitch, shutting his eyes. “Run away. We are busy here.” Kotick made his dolphin-jump air shouted loud he could: “Clam-eater! Clam-eater!” He knew Sea Vitch never caught fish his life always rooted clams seaweed; though he pretended terrible person. Naturally Chickies Gooverooskies Epatkas--the Burgomaster Gulls Kittiwakes Puffins, always looking chance rude, took cry, and--so Limmershin told me--for nearly five minutes could heard gun fired Walrus Islet. All population yelling screaming “Clam-eater! Stareek [old man]!” Sea Vitch rolled side side grunting coughing. “Now tell?” said Kotick, breath. “Go ask Sea Cow,” said Sea Vitch. “If he living still, he will able tell you.” “How shall I know Sea Cow I meet him?” said Kotick, sheering off. “He is thing sea uglier Sea Vitch,” screamed Burgomaster gull, wheeling Sea Vitch’s nose. “Uglier, worse manners! Stareek!” Kotick swam back Novastoshnah, leaving gulls scream. There he found one sympathized his little attempt discover quiet place seals. They told men always driven holluschickie--it part day’s work--and he like see ugly things he gone killing grounds. But none seals seen killing, made difference his friends. Besides, Kotick white seal. “What must do,” said old Sea Catch, he heard his son’s adventures, “is grow big seal like father, nursery beach, leave alone. In another five years ought able fight yourself.” Even gentle Matkah, his mother, said: “You never able stop killing. Go play sea, Kotick.” And Kotick went danced Fire-dance heavy little heart. That autumn he left beach soon he could, set alone notion his bullet-head. He going find Sea Cow, person sea, he going find quiet island good firm beaches seals live on, men could get them. So he explored explored North South Pacific, swimming much three hundred miles day night. He met adventures told, narrowly escaped caught Basking Shark, Spotted Shark, Hammerhead, he met untrustworthy ruffians loaf seas, heavy polite fish, scarlet spotted scallops moored one place hundreds years, grow proud it; he never met Sea Cow, he never found island he could fancy. If beach good hard, slope behind seals play on, always smoke whaler horizon, boiling blubber, Kotick knew meant. Or else he could see seals visited island killed off, Kotick knew men come would come again. He picked old stumpy-tailed albatross, told Kerguelen Island place peace quiet, Kotick went he smashed pieces wicked black cliffs heavy sleet-storm lightning thunder. Yet he pulled gale he could see even seal nursery. And islands he visited. Limmershin gave long list them, he said Kotick spent five seasons exploring, four months’ rest year Novastoshnah, holluschickie used make fun his imaginary islands. He went Gallapagos, horrid dry place Equator, he nearly baked death; he went Georgia Islands, Orkneys, Emerald Island, Little Nightingale Island, Gough’s Island, Bouvet’s Island, Crossets, even little speck island south Cape Good Hope. But everywhere People Sea told things. Seals come islands upon time, men killed off. Even he swam thousands miles Pacific got place called Cape Corrientes (that he coming back Gough’s Island), he found hundred mangy seals rock told men came too. That nearly broke his heart, he headed round Horn back his beaches; his way north he hauled island full green trees, he found old, old seal dying, Kotick caught fish told his sorrows. “Now,” said Kotick, “I going back Novastoshnah, I driven killing-pens holluschickie I shall care.” The old seal said, “Try more. I last Lost Rookery Masafuera, days men killed us hundred thousand story beaches day white seal would come North lead seal people quiet place. I old, I shall never live see day, others will. Try more.” And Kotick curled his mustache (it beauty) said, “I white seal ever born beaches, I seal, black white, ever thought looking new islands.” This cheered immensely; he came back Novastoshnah summer, Matkah, his mother, begged marry settle down, he longer holluschick full-grown sea-catch, curly white mane his shoulders, heavy, big, fierce his father. “Give another season,” he said. “Remember, Mother, always seventh wave goes farthest beach.” Curiously enough, another seal thought she would put marrying till next year, Kotick danced Fire-dance her Lukannon Beach night he set his last exploration. This time he went westward, he fallen trail great shoal halibut, he needed least one hundred pounds fish day keep good condition. He chased till he tired, he curled went sleep hollows ground swell sets Copper Island. He knew coast perfectly well, midnight, he felt gently bumped weed-bed, he said, “Hm, tide’s running strong tonight,” turning water opened his eyes slowly stretched. Then he jumped like cat, he saw huge things nosing shoal water browsing heavy fringes weeds. “By Great Combers Magellan!” he said, beneath his mustache. “Who Deep Sea people?” They like walrus, sea lion, seal, bear, whale, shark, fish, squid, scallop Kotick ever seen before. They twenty thirty feet long, hind flippers, shovel-like tail looked whittled wet leather. Their heads foolish-looking things ever saw, balanced ends tails deep water were not grazing, bowing solemnly waving front flippers fat man waves his arm. “Ahem!” said Kotick. “Good sport, gentlemen?” The big things answered bowing waving flippers like Frog Footman. When began feeding Kotick saw upper lip split two pieces could twitch apart foot bring together whole bushel seaweed splits. They tucked stuff mouths chumped solemnly. “Messy style feeding, that,” said Kotick. They bowed again, Kotick began lose his temper. “Very good,” he said. “If happen extra joint front flipper need not show so. I see bow gracefully, I like know names.” The split lips moved twitched; glassy green eyes stared, speak. “Well!” said Kotick. “You are people I have ever met uglier Sea Vitch--and worse manners.” Then he remembered flash Burgomaster gull screamed he little yearling Walrus Islet, he tumbled backward water, he knew he found Sea Cow last. The sea cows went schlooping grazing chumping weed, Kotick asked questions every language he picked his travels; Sea People talk nearly many languages human beings. But sea cows answer Sea Cow cannot talk. He six bones his neck he ought seven, say sea prevents speaking even his companions. But, know, he extra joint his foreflipper, waving he makes answers sort clumsy telegraphic code. By daylight Kotick’s mane standing end his temper gone dead crabs go. Then Sea Cow began travel northward slowly, stopping hold absurd bowing councils time time, Kotick followed them, saying himself, “People idiots would killed long ago had not found safe island. And good enough Sea Cow good enough Sea Catch. All same, I wish they would hurry.” It weary work Kotick. The herd never went forty fifty miles day, stopped feed night, kept close shore time; Kotick swam round them, them, them, he could hurry one-half mile. As went farther north held bowing council every hours, Kotick nearly bit his mustache impatience till he saw following warm current water, he respected more. One night sank shiny water--sank like stones--and first time since he known began swim quickly. Kotick followed, pace astonished him, he never dreamed Sea Cow anything swimmer. They headed cliff shore--a cliff ran deep water, plunged dark hole foot it, twenty fathoms sea. It long, long swim, Kotick badly wanted fresh air he dark tunnel led through. “My wig!” he said, he rose, gasping puffing, open water farther end. “It long dive, worth it.” The sea cows separated browsing lazily along edges finest beaches Kotick ever seen. There long stretches smooth-worn rock running miles, exactly fitted make seal-nurseries, play-grounds hard sand sloping inland behind them, rollers seals dance in, long grass roll in, sand dunes climb down, and, best all, Kotick knew feel water, never deceives true sea catch, men ever come there. The first thing he assure fishing good, he swam along beaches counted delightful low sandy islands half hidden beautiful rolling fog. Away northward, sea, ran line bars shoals rocks would never let ship come within six miles beach, islands mainland stretch deep water ran perpendicular cliffs, somewhere cliffs mouth tunnel. “It is Novastoshnah again, ten times better,” said Kotick. “Sea Cow must wiser I thought. Men cannot come cliffs, even men; shoals seaward would knock ship splinters. If place sea safe, it.” He began think seal he left behind him, though he hurry go back Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored new country, he would able answer questions. Then he dived made sure mouth tunnel, raced southward. No one sea cow seal would dreamed place, he looked back cliffs even Kotick could hardly believe he them. He six days going home, though he swimming slowly; he hauled Sea Lion’s Neck first person he met seal waiting him, she saw look his eyes he found his island last. But holluschickie Sea Catch, his father, seals laughed he told he discovered, young seal his age said, “This well, Kotick, cannot come one knows order us like this. Remember we have fighting nurseries, that is thing never did. You preferred prowling sea.” The seals laughed this, young seal began twisting his head side side. He married year, making great fuss it. “I have nursery fight for,” said Kotick. “I want show place safe. What is use fighting?” “Oh, you are trying back out, course I have say,” said young seal ugly chuckle. “Will come I win?” said Kotick. And green light came his eye, he angry fight all. “Very good,” said young seal carelessly. “If win, I will come.” He time change his mind, Kotick’s head his teeth sunk blubber young seal’s neck. Then he threw back his haunches hauled his enemy beach, shook him, knocked over. Then Kotick roared seals: “I have done best five seasons past. I have found island you will safe, unless heads dragged silly necks will not believe. I am going teach now. Look yourselves!” Limmershin told never his life--and Limmershin sees ten thousand big seals fighting every year--never his little life he see anything like Kotick’s charge nurseries. He flung biggest sea catch he could find, caught throat, choked bumped banged till he grunted mercy, threw aside attacked next. You see, Kotick never fasted four months big seals every year, his deep-sea swimming trips kept perfect condition, and, best all, he never fought before. His curly white mane stood rage, his eyes flamed, his big dog teeth glistened, he splendid look at. Old Sea Catch, his father, saw tearing past, hauling grizzled old seals though halibut, upsetting young bachelors directions; Sea Catch gave roar shouted: “He may fool, he best fighter beaches! Do not tackle father, son! He is you!” Kotick roared answer, old Sea Catch waddled his mustache end, blowing like locomotive, Matkah seal going marry Kotick cowered admired men-folk. It gorgeous fight, two fought long seal dared lift his head, none paraded grandly beach side side, bellowing. At night, Northern Lights winking flashing fog, Kotick climbed bare rock looked scattered nurseries torn bleeding seals. “Now,” he said, “I have taught lesson.” “My wig!” said old Sea Catch, boosting stiffly, he fearfully mauled. “The Killer Whale could cut worse. Son, I am proud you, what is more, I will come island--if place.” “Hear you, fat pigs sea. Who comes Sea Cow’s tunnel? Answer, I shall teach again,” roared Kotick. There murmur like ripple tide beaches. “We come,” said thousands tired voices. “We follow Kotick, White Seal.” Then Kotick dropped his head his shoulders shut his eyes proudly. He white seal more, red head tail. All he would scorned look touch one his wounds. A week later he his army (nearly ten thousand holluschickie old seals) went away north Sea Cow’s tunnel, Kotick leading them, seals stayed Novastoshnah called idiots. But next spring, met fishing banks Pacific, Kotick’s seals told tales new beaches beyond Sea Cow’s tunnel seals left Novastoshnah. Of course done once, seals clever, need long time turn things minds, year year seals went away Novastoshnah, Lukannon, nurseries, quiet, sheltered beaches Kotick sits summer through, getting bigger fatter stronger year, holluschickie play around him, sea man comes. Lukannon This great deep-sea song St. Paul seals sing heading back beaches summer. It sort sad seal National Anthem. I met mates morning (and, oh, I old!) Where roaring ledges summer ground-swell rolled; I heard lift chorus drowned breakers’ song-- The Beaches Lukannon--two million voices strong. The song pleasant stations beside salt lagoons, The song blowing squadrons shuffled dunes, The song midnight dances churned sea flame-- The Beaches Lukannon--before sealers came! I met mates morning (I will never meet more!); They came went legions darkened shore. And foam-flecked offing far voice could reach We hailed landing-parties sang beach. The Beaches Lukannon--the winter wheat tall-- The dripping, crinkled lichens, sea-fog drenching all! The platforms playground, shining smooth worn! The Beaches Lukannon--the home born! I met mates morning, broken, scattered band. Men shoot us water club us land; Men drive us Salt House like silly sheep tame, And still sing Lukannon--before sealers came. Wheel down, wheel southward; oh, Gooverooska, go! And tell Deep-Sea Viceroys story woe; Ere, empty shark’s egg tempest flings ashore, The Beaches Lukannon shall know sons more! “Rikki-Tikki-Tavi” At hole he went Red-Eye called Wrinkle-Skin. Hear little Red-Eye saith: “Nag, come dance death!” Eye eye head head, (Keep measure, Nag.) This shall end one dead; (At thy pleasure, Nag.) Turn turn twist twist-- (Run hide thee, Nag.) Hah! The hooded Death missed! (Woe betide thee, Nag!) This story great war Rikki-tikki-tavi fought single-handed, bath-rooms big bungalow Segowlee cantonment. Darzee, Tailorbird, helped him, Chuchundra, musk-rat, never comes middle floor, always creeps round wall, gave advice, Rikki-tikki real fighting. He mongoose, rather like little cat his fur his tail, quite like weasel his head his habits. His eyes end his restless nose pink. He could scratch anywhere he pleased leg, front back, he chose use. He could fluff his tail till looked like bottle brush, his war cry he scuttled long grass was: “Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!” One day, high summer flood washed burrow he lived his father mother, carried him, kicking clucking, roadside ditch. He found little wisp grass floating there, clung till he lost his senses. When he revived, he lying hot sun middle garden path, draggled indeed, small boy saying, “Here is dead mongoose. Let us funeral.” “No,” said his mother, “let us take dry him. Perhaps he is not really dead.” They took house, big man picked his finger thumb said he dead half choked. So wrapped cotton wool, warmed little fire, he opened his eyes sneezed. “Now,” said big man (he Englishman moved bungalow), “do not frighten him, we will see he will do.” It hardest thing world frighten mongoose, he eaten nose tail curiosity. The motto mongoose family “Run find out,” Rikki-tikki true mongoose. He looked cotton wool, decided good eat, ran round table, sat put his fur order, scratched himself, jumped small boy’s shoulder. “Do not frightened, Teddy,” said his father. “That is his way making friends.” “Ouch! He is tickling chin,” said Teddy. Rikki-tikki looked boy’s collar neck, snuffed his ear, climbed floor, he sat rubbing his nose. “Good gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that is wild creature! I suppose he is tame we have kind him.” “All mongooses like that,” said her husband. “If Teddy does not pick tail, try put cage, he will run house day long. Let us give something eat.” They gave little piece raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked immensely, finished he went veranda sat sunshine fluffed his fur make dry roots. Then he felt better. “There things find house,” he said himself, “than family could find lives. I shall certainly stay find out.” He spent day roaming house. He nearly drowned bath-tubs, put his nose ink writing table, burned end big man’s cigar, he climbed big man’s lap see writing done. At nightfall he ran Teddy’s nursery watch kerosene lamps lighted, Teddy went bed Rikki-tikki climbed too. But he restless companion, he get attend every noise night, find made it. Teddy’s mother father came in, last thing, look boy, Rikki-tikki awake pillow. “I do not like that,” said Teddy’s mother. “He may bite child.” “He will thing,” said father. “Teddy’s safer little beast he bloodhound watch him. If snake came nursery now--” But Teddy’s mother would not think anything awful. Early morning Rikki-tikki came early breakfast veranda riding Teddy’s shoulder, gave banana boiled egg. He sat laps one other, every well-brought-up mongoose always hopes house mongoose day rooms run in; Rikki-tikki’s mother (she used live general’s house Segowlee) carefully told Rikki ever he came across white men. Then Rikki-tikki went garden see seen. It large garden, half cultivated, bushes, big summer-houses, Marshal Niel roses, lime orange trees, clumps bamboos, thickets high grass. Rikki-tikki licked his lips. “This splendid hunting-ground,” he said, his tail grew bottle-brushy thought it, he scuttled garden, snuffing till he heard sorrowful voices thorn-bush. It Darzee, Tailorbird, his wife. They made beautiful nest pulling two big leaves together stitching edges fibers, filled hollow cotton downy fluff. The nest swayed fro, sat rim cried. “What matter?” asked Rikki-tikki. “We miserable,” said Darzee. “One babies fell nest yesterday Nag ate him.” “H’m!” said Rikki-tikki, “that sad--but I stranger here. Who Nag?” Darzee his wife cowered nest without answering, thick grass foot bush came low hiss--a horrid cold sound made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. Then inch inch grass rose head spread hood Nag, big black cobra, he five feet long tongue tail. When he lifted one-third clear ground, he stayed balancing fro exactly dandelion tuft balances wind, he looked Rikki-tikki wicked snake’s eyes never change expression, whatever snake may thinking of. “Who Nag?” said he. “I Nag. The great God Brahm put his mark upon people, first cobra spread his hood keep sun Brahm he slept. Look, afraid!” He spread his hood ever, Rikki-tikki saw spectacle-mark back looks exactly like eye part hook-and-eye fastening. He afraid minute, impossible mongoose stay frightened length time, though Rikki-tikki never met live cobra before, his mother fed dead ones, he knew grown mongoose’s business life fight eat snakes. Nag knew and, bottom his cold heart, he afraid. “Well,” said Rikki-tikki, his tail began fluff again, “marks marks, think right eat fledglings nest?” Nag thinking himself, watching least little movement grass behind Rikki-tikki. He knew mongooses garden meant death sooner later his family, he wanted get Rikki-tikki his guard. So he dropped his head little, put one side. “Let us talk,” he said. “You eat eggs. Why I eat birds?” “Behind you! Look behind you!” sang Darzee. Rikki-tikki knew better waste time staring. He jumped air high he could go, whizzed head Nagaina, Nag’s wicked wife. She crept behind he talking, make end him. He heard her savage hiss stroke missed. He came almost across her back, he old mongoose he would known time break her back one bite; he afraid terrible lashing return stroke cobra. He bit, indeed, bite long enough, he jumped clear whisking tail, leaving Nagaina torn angry. “Wicked, wicked Darzee!” said Nag, lashing high he could reach toward nest thorn-bush. But Darzee built reach snakes, swayed fro. Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red hot (when mongoose’s eyes grow red, he angry), he sat back his tail hind legs like little kangaroo, looked round him, chattered rage. But Nag Nagaina disappeared grass. When snake misses stroke, never says anything gives sign means next. Rikki-tikki care follow them, he feel sure he could manage two snakes once. So he trotted gravel path near house, sat think. It serious matter him. If read old books natural history, find say mongoose fights snake happens get bitten, he runs eats herb cures him. That true. The victory matter quickness eye quickness foot--snake’s blow mongoose’s jump--and eye follow motion snake’s head strikes, makes things much wonderful magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he young mongoose, made pleased think he managed escape blow behind. It gave confidence himself, Teddy came running path, Rikki-tikki ready petted. But Teddy stooping, something wriggled little dust, tiny voice said: “Be careful. I Death!” It Karait, dusty brown snakeling lies choice dusty earth; his bite dangerous cobra’s. But he small nobody thinks him, he harm people. Rikki-tikki’s eyes grew red again, he danced Karait peculiar rocking, swaying motion he inherited his family. It looks funny, perfectly balanced gait fly angle please, dealing snakes advantage. If Rikki-tikki known, he much dangerous thing fighting Nag, Karait small, turn quickly, unless Rikki bit close back head, he would get return stroke his eye his lip. But Rikki know. His eyes red, he rocked back forth, looking good place hold. Karait struck out. Rikki jumped sideways tried run in, wicked little dusty gray head lashed within fraction his shoulder, he jump body, head followed his heels close. Teddy shouted house: “Oh, look here! Our mongoose killing snake.” And Rikki-tikki heard scream Teddy’s mother. His father ran stick, time he came up, Karait lunged far, Rikki-tikki sprung, jumped snake’s back, dropped his head far his forelegs, bitten high back he could get hold, rolled away. That bite paralyzed Karait, Rikki-tikki going eat tail, custom his family dinner, he remembered full meal makes slow mongoose, he wanted his strength quickness ready, he must keep thin. He went away dust bath castor-oil bushes, Teddy’s father beat dead Karait. “What use that?” thought Rikki-tikki. “I settled all;” Teddy’s mother picked dust hugged him, crying he saved Teddy death, Teddy’s father said he providence, Teddy looked big scared eyes. Rikki-tikki rather amused fuss, which, course, he understand. Teddy’s mother might well petted Teddy playing dust. Rikki thoroughly enjoying himself. That night dinner, walking fro among wine-glasses table, he might stuffed three times nice things. But he remembered Nag Nagaina, though pleasant patted petted Teddy’s mother, sit Teddy’s shoulder, his eyes would get red time time, he would go his long war cry “Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!” Teddy carried bed, insisted Rikki-tikki sleeping his chin. Rikki-tikki well bred bite scratch, soon Teddy asleep he went his nightly walk round house, dark he ran Chuchundra, musk-rat, creeping around wall. Chuchundra broken-hearted little beast. He whimpers cheeps night, trying make his mind run middle room. But he never gets there. “Do not kill me,” said Chuchundra, almost weeping. “Rikki-tikki, do not kill me!” “Do think snake-killer kills muskrats?” said Rikki-tikki scornfully. “Those kill snakes get killed snakes,” said Chuchundra, sorrowfully ever. “And I sure Nag will not mistake dark night?” “There is least danger,” said Rikki-tikki. “But Nag garden, I know do not go there.” “My cousin Chua, rat, told me--” said Chuchundra, he stopped. “Told what?” “H’sh! Nag everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You talked Chua garden.” “I did not--so must tell me. Quick, Chuchundra, I will bite you!” Chuchundra sat cried till tears rolled his whiskers. “I poor man,” he sobbed. “I never spirit enough run middle room. H’sh! I must not tell anything. Cannot hear, Rikki-tikki?” Rikki-tikki listened. The house still still, he thought he could catch faintest scratch-scratch world--a noise faint wasp walking window-pane--the dry scratch snake’s scales brick-work. “That is Nag Nagaina,” he said himself, “and he crawling bath-room sluice. You are right, Chuchundra; I talked Chua.” He stole Teddy’s bath-room, nothing there, Teddy’s mother’s bathroom. At bottom smooth plaster wall brick pulled make sluice bath water, Rikki-tikki stole masonry curb bath put, he heard Nag Nagaina whispering together outside moonlight. “When house emptied people,” said Nagaina her husband, “he go away, garden again. Go quietly, remember big man killed Karait first one bite. Then come tell me, hunt Rikki-tikki together.” “But sure anything gained killing people?” said Nag. “Everything. When people bungalow, mongoose garden? So long bungalow empty, king queen garden; remember soon eggs melon bed hatch (as may tomorrow), children need room quiet.” “I thought that,” said Nag. “I go, need hunt Rikki-tikki afterward. I kill big man his wife, child I can, come away quietly. Then bungalow empty, Rikki-tikki go.” Rikki-tikki tingled rage hatred this, Nag’s head came sluice, his five feet cold body followed it. Angry he was, Rikki-tikki frightened he saw size big cobra. Nag coiled up, raised his head, looked bathroom dark, Rikki could see his eyes glitter. “Now, I kill here, Nagaina know; I fight open floor, odds his favor. What I do?” said Rikki-tikki-tavi. Nag waved fro, Rikki-tikki heard drinking biggest water-jar used fill bath. “That good,” said snake. “Now, Karait killed, big man stick. He may stick still, he comes bathe morning he stick. I shall wait till he comes. Nagaina--do hear me?--I shall wait cool till daytime.” There answer outside, Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina gone away. Nag coiled down, coil coil, round bulge bottom water jar, Rikki-tikki stayed still death. After hour he began move, muscle muscle, toward jar. Nag asleep, Rikki-tikki looked his big back, wondering would best place good hold. “If I do not break his back first jump,” said Rikki, “he still fight. And he fights--O Rikki!” He looked thickness neck hood, much him; bite near tail would make Nag savage. “It must head”’ he said last; “the head hood. And, I there, I must let go.” Then he jumped. The head lying little clear water jar, curve it; and, his teeth met, Rikki braced his back bulge red earthenware hold head. This gave one second’s purchase, he made it. Then he battered fro rat shaken dog--to fro floor, down, around great circles, his eyes red he held body cart-whipped floor, upsetting tin dipper soap dish flesh brush, banged tin side bath. As he held he closed his jaws tighter tighter, he made sure he would banged death, and, honor his family, he preferred found his teeth locked. He dizzy, aching, felt shaken pieces something went like thunderclap behind him. A hot wind knocked senseless red fire singed his fur. The big man wakened noise, fired barrels shotgun Nag behind hood. Rikki-tikki held his eyes shut, he quite sure he dead. But head move, big man picked said, “It is mongoose again, Alice. The little chap saved lives now.” Then Teddy’s mother came white face, saw left Nag, Rikki-tikki dragged Teddy’s bedroom spent half rest night shaking tenderly find whether he really broken forty pieces, he fancied. When morning came he stiff, well pleased his doings. “Now I Nagaina settle with, she worse five Nags, there is knowing eggs she spoke hatch. Goodness! I must go see Darzee,” he said. Without waiting breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran thornbush Darzee singing song triumph top his voice. The news Nag’s death garden, sweeper thrown body rubbish-heap. “Oh, stupid tuft feathers!” said Rikki-tikki angrily. “Is time sing?” “Nag dead--is dead--is dead!” sang Darzee. “The valiant Rikki-tikki caught head held fast. The big man brought bang-stick, Nag fell two pieces! He never eat babies again.” “All that is true enough. But where is Nagaina?” said Rikki-tikki, looking carefully round him. “Nagaina came bathroom sluice called Nag,” Darzee went on, “and Nag came end stick--the sweeper picked end stick threw upon rubbish heap. Let us sing great, red-eyed Rikki-tikki!” And Darzee filled his throat sang. “If I could get nest, I would roll babies out!” said Rikki-tikki. “You do not know right thing right time. You are safe enough nest there, it is war here. Stop singing minute, Darzee.” “For great, beautiful Rikki-tikki’s sake I stop,” said Darzee. “What it, O Killer terrible Nag?” “Where Nagaina, third time?” “On rubbish heap stables, mourning Nag. Great Rikki-tikki white teeth.” “Bother white teeth! Have ever heard she keeps her eggs?” “In melon bed, end nearest wall, sun strikes nearly day. She hid weeks ago.” “And never thought worth tell me? The end nearest wall, said?” “Rikki-tikki, going eat her eggs?” “Not eat exactly; no. Darzee, grain sense fly stables pretend wing broken, let Nagaina chase away bush. I must get melon-bed, I went she would see me.” Darzee feather-brained little fellow could never hold one idea time his head. And he knew Nagaina’s children born eggs like his own, he did not think first fair kill them. But his wife sensible bird, she knew cobra’s eggs meant young cobras later on. So she flew nest, left Darzee keep babies warm, continue his song death Nag. Darzee like man ways. She fluttered front Nagaina rubbish heap cried out, “Oh, wing broken! The boy house threw stone broke it.” Then she fluttered desperately ever. Nagaina lifted her head hissed, “You warned Rikki-tikki I would killed him. Indeed truly, you have chosen bad place lame in.” And she moved toward Darzee’s wife, slipping along dust. “The boy broke stone!” shrieked Darzee’s wife. “Well! It may consolation you are dead know I shall settle accounts boy. My husband lies rubbish heap morning, night boy house lie still. What use running away? I sure catch you. Little fool, look me!” Darzee’s wife knew better that, bird looks snake’s eyes gets frightened she cannot move. Darzee’s wife fluttered on, piping sorrowfully, never leaving ground, Nagaina quickened her pace. Rikki-tikki heard going path stables, he raced end melon patch near wall. There, warm litter melons, cunningly hidden, he found twenty-five eggs, size bantam’s eggs, whitish skin instead she will. “I day soon,” he said, he could see baby cobras curled inside skin, he knew minute hatched could kill man mongoose. He bit tops eggs fast he could, taking care crush young cobras, turned litter time time see whether he missed any. At last three eggs left, Rikki-tikki began chuckle himself, he heard Darzee’s wife screaming: “Rikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward house, she gone veranda, and--oh, come quickly--she means killing!” Rikki-tikki smashed two eggs, tumbled backward melon-bed third egg his mouth, scuttled veranda hard he could put foot ground. Teddy his mother father early breakfast, Rikki-tikki saw eating anything. They sat stone-still, faces white. Nagaina coiled matting Teddy’s chair, within easy striking distance Teddy’s bare leg, she swaying fro, singing song triumph. “Son big man killed Nag,” she hissed, “stay still. I ready yet. Wait little. Keep still, three! If move I strike, move I strike. Oh, foolish people, killed Nag!” Teddy’s eyes fixed his father, his father could whisper, “Sit still, Teddy. You must not move. Teddy, keep still.” Then Rikki-tikki came cried, “Turn round, Nagaina. Turn fight!” “All good time,” said she, without moving her eyes. “I settle account presently. Look friends, Rikki-tikki. They still white. They afraid. They dare move, come step nearer I strike.” “Look eggs,” said Rikki-tikki, “in melon bed near wall. Go look, Nagaina!” The big snake turned half around, saw egg veranda. “Ah-h! Give me,” she said. Rikki-tikki put his paws one side egg, his eyes blood-red. “What price snake’s egg? For young cobra? For young king cobra? For last--the last brood? The ants eating others melon bed.” Nagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything sake one egg. Rikki-tikki saw Teddy’s father shoot big hand, catch Teddy shoulder, drag across little table tea-cups, safe reach Nagaina. “Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! Rikk-tck-tck!” chuckled Rikki-tikki. “The boy safe, I--I--I caught Nag hood last night bathroom.” Then he began jump down, four feet together, his head close floor. “He threw fro, he could shake off. He dead big man blew two. I it! Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! Come then, Nagaina. Come fight me. You shall widow long.” Nagaina saw she lost her chance killing Teddy, egg lay Rikki-tikki’s paws. “Give egg, Rikki-tikki. Give last eggs, I go away never come back,” she said, lowering her hood. “Yes, go away, never come back. For go rubbish heap Nag. Fight, widow! The big man gone his gun! Fight!” Rikki-tikki bounding round Nagaina, keeping reach her stroke, his little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself together flung him. Rikki-tikki jumped backward. Again she struck, time her head came whack matting veranda she gathered herself together like watch spring. Then Rikki-tikki danced circle get behind her, Nagaina spun round keep her head his head, rustle her tail matting sounded like dry leaves blown along wind. He forgotten egg. It still lay veranda, Nagaina came nearer nearer it, till last, Rikki-tikki drawing breath, she caught her mouth, turned veranda steps, flew like arrow path, Rikki-tikki behind her. When cobra runs her life, she goes like whip-lash flicked across horse’s neck. Rikki-tikki knew he must catch her, trouble would begin again. She headed straight long grass thorn-bush, he running Rikki-tikki heard Darzee still singing his foolish little song triumph. But Darzee’s wife wiser. She flew her nest Nagaina came along, flapped her wings Nagaina’s head. If Darzee helped might turned her, Nagaina lowered her hood went on. Still, instant’s delay brought Rikki-tikki her, she plunged rat-hole she Nag used live, his little white teeth clenched her tail, he went her--and mongooses, however wise old may be, care follow cobra hole. It dark hole; Rikki-tikki never knew might open give Nagaina room turn strike him. He held savagely, stuck his feet act brakes dark slope hot, moist earth. Then grass mouth hole stopped waving, Darzee said, “It Rikki-tikki! We must sing his death song. Valiant Rikki-tikki dead! For Nagaina surely kill underground.” So he sang mournful song he made spur minute, he got touching part, grass quivered again, Rikki-tikki, covered dirt, dragged hole leg leg, licking his whiskers. Darzee stopped little shout. Rikki-tikki shook dust his fur sneezed. “It over,” he said. “The widow never come again.” And red ants live grass stems heard him, began troop one another see he spoken truth. Rikki-tikki curled grass slept he was--slept slept till late afternoon, he done hard day’s work. “Now,” he said, he awoke, “I go back house. Tell Coppersmith, Darzee, he tell garden Nagaina dead.” The Coppersmith bird makes noise exactly like beating little hammer copper pot; reason he always making he town crier every Indian garden, tells news everybody cares listen. As Rikki-tikki went path, he heard his “attention” notes like tiny dinner gong, steady “Ding-dong-tock! Nag dead--dong! Nagaina dead! Ding-dong-tock!” That set birds garden singing, frogs croaking, Nag Nagaina used eat frogs well little birds. When Rikki got house, Teddy Teddy’s mother (she looked white still, she fainting) Teddy’s father came almost cried him; night he ate given till he could eat more, went bed Teddy’s shoulder, Teddy’s mother saw she came look late night. “He saved lives Teddy’s life,” she said her husband. “Just think, he saved lives.” Rikki-tikki woke jump, mongooses light sleepers. “Oh, it is you,” said he. “What bothering for? All cobras dead. And were not, I am here.” Rikki-tikki right proud himself. But he grow proud, he kept garden mongoose keep it, tooth jump spring bite, till never cobra dared show head inside walls. Darzee’s Chant (Sung honor Rikki-tikki-tavi) Singer tailor I-- Doubled joys I know-- Proud lilt sky, Proud house I sew-- Over under, weave I music--so weave I house I sew. Sing fledglings again, Mother, oh lift head! Evil plagued us slain, Death garden lies dead. Terror hid roses impotent--flung dung-hill dead! Who delivered us, who? Tell his nest his name. Rikki, valiant, true, Tikki, eyeballs flame, Rikk-tikki-tikki, ivory-fanged, hunter eyeballs flame! Give Thanks Birds, Bowing tail feathers spread! Praise nightingale words-- Nay, I praise instead. Hear! I sing praise bottle-tailed Rikki, eyeballs red! (Here Rikki-tikki interrupted, rest song lost.) Toomai Elephants I remember I was, I sick rope chain-- I remember old strength forest affairs. I sell back man bundle sugar-cane: I go kind, wood-folk lairs. I go day, morning break-- Out wind’s untainted kiss, water’s clean caress; I forget ankle-ring snap picket stake. I revisit lost loves, playmates masterless! Kala Nag, means Black Snake, served Indian Government every way elephant could serve forty-seven years, he fully twenty years old he caught, makes nearly seventy--a ripe age elephant. He remembered pushing, big leather pad his forehead, gun stuck deep mud, Afghan War 1842, he come his full strength. His mother Radha Pyari,--Radha darling,--who caught drive Kala Nag, told him, his little milk tusks dropped out, elephants afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag knew advice good, first time he saw she will burst he backed, screaming, stand piled rifles, bayonets pricked his softest places. So, he twenty-five, he gave afraid, he best-loved best-looked-after elephant service Government India. He carried tents, twelve hundred pounds’ weight tents, march Upper India. He hoisted ship end steam crane taken days across water, made carry mortar his back strange rocky country far India, seen Emperor Theodore lying dead Magdala, come back steamer entitled, soldiers said, Abyssinian War medal. He seen his fellow elephants die cold epilepsy starvation sunstroke place called Ali Musjid, ten years later; afterward he sent thousands miles south haul pile big balks teak timberyards Moulmein. There he half killed insubordinate young elephant shirking his fair share work. After he taken timber-hauling, employed, score elephants trained business, helping catch wild elephants among Garo hills. Elephants strictly preserved Indian Government. There one whole department nothing else hunt them, catch them, break in, send country needed work. Kala Nag stood ten fair feet shoulders, his tusks cut short five feet, bound round ends, prevent splitting, bands copper; he could stumps untrained elephant could real sharpened ones. When, weeks weeks cautious driving scattered elephants across hills, forty fifty wild monsters driven last stockade, big drop gate, made tree trunks lashed together, jarred behind them, Kala Nag, word command, would go flaring, trumpeting pandemonium (generally night, flicker torches made difficult judge distances), and, picking biggest wildest tusker mob, would hammer hustle quiet men backs elephants roped tied smaller ones. There nothing way fighting Kala Nag, old wise Black Snake, know, he stood his time charge wounded tiger, and, curling his soft trunk harm’s way, knocked springing brute sideways mid-air quick sickle cut his head, he invented himself; knocked over, kneeled upon his huge knees till life went gasp howl, fluffy striped thing ground Kala Nag pull tail. “Yes,” said Big Toomai, his driver, son Black Toomai taken Abyssinia, grandson Toomai Elephants seen caught, “there nothing Black Snake fears except me. He seen three generations us feed groom him, he live see four.” “He afraid also,” said Little Toomai, standing his full height four feet, one rag upon him. He ten years old, eldest son Big Toomai, and, according custom, he would take his father’s place Kala Nag’s neck he grew up, would handle heavy iron ankus, elephant goad, worn smooth his father, his grandfather, his great-grandfather. He knew he talking of; he born Kala Nag’s shadow, played end his trunk he could walk, taken water soon he could walk, Kala Nag would dreamed disobeying his shrill little orders he would dreamed killing day Big Toomai carried little brown baby Kala Nag’s tusks, told salute his master be. “Yes,” said Little Toomai, “he afraid me,” he took long strides Kala Nag, called fat old pig, made lift his feet one other. “Wah!” said Little Toomai, “thou art big elephant,” he wagged his fluffy head, quoting his father. “The Government may pay elephants, belong us mahouts. When thou art old, Kala Nag, come rich rajah, he buy thee Government, account thy size thy manners, thou wilt nothing carry gold earrings thy ears, gold howdah thy back, red cloth covered gold thy sides, walk head processions King. Then I shall sit thy neck, O Kala Nag, silver ankus, men run us golden sticks, crying, `Room King’s elephant!’ That good, Kala Nag, good hunting jungles.” “Umph!” said Big Toomai. “Thou art boy, wild buffalo-calf. This running among hills best Government service. I getting old, I love wild elephants. Give brick elephant lines, one stall elephant, big stumps tie safely, flat, broad roads exercise upon, instead come-and-go camping. Aha, Cawnpore barracks good. There bazaar close by, three hours’ work day.” Little Toomai remembered Cawnpore elephant-lines said nothing. He much preferred camp life, hated broad, flat roads, daily grubbing grass forage reserve, long hours nothing except watch Kala Nag fidgeting his pickets. What Little Toomai liked scramble bridle paths elephant could take; dip valley below; glimpses wild elephants browsing miles away; rush frightened pig peacock Kala Nag’s feet; blinding warm rains, hills valleys smoked; beautiful misty mornings nobody knew would camp night; steady, cautious drive wild elephants, mad rush blaze hullabaloo last night’s drive, elephants poured stockade like boulders landslide, found could get out, flung heavy posts driven back yells flaring torches volleys blank cartridge. Even little boy could use there, Toomai useful three boys. He would get his torch wave it, yell best. But really good time came driving began, Keddah--that is, stockade--looked like picture end world, men make signs one another, could hear speak. Then Little Toomai would climb top one quivering stockade posts, his sun-bleached brown hair flying loose his shoulders, he looking like goblin torch-light. And soon lull could hear his high-pitched yells encouragement Kala Nag, trumpeting crashing, snapping ropes, groans tethered elephants. “Mael, mael, Kala Nag! (Go on, go on, Black Snake!) Dant do! (Give tusk!) Somalo! Somalo! (Careful, careful!) Maro! Mar! (Hit him, hit him!) Mind post! Arre! Arre! Hai! Yai! Kya-a-ah!” he would shout, big fight Kala Nag wild elephant would sway fro across Keddah, old elephant catchers would wipe sweat eyes, find time nod Little Toomai wriggling joy top posts. He wriggle. One night he slid post slipped elephants threw loose end rope, dropped, driver trying get purchase leg kicking young calf (calves always give trouble full-grown animals). Kala Nag saw him, caught his trunk, handed Big Toomai, slapped there, put back post. Next morning he gave scolding said, “Are good brick elephant lines little tent carrying enough, thou must needs go elephant catching thy account, little worthless? Now foolish hunters, whose pay less pay, spoken Petersen Sahib matter.” Little Toomai frightened. He know much white men, Petersen Sahib greatest white man world him. He head Keddah operations--the man caught elephants Government India, knew ways elephants living man. “What--what happen?” said Little Toomai. “Happen! The worst happen. Petersen Sahib madman. Else he go hunting wild devils? He may even require thee elephant catcher, sleep anywhere fever-filled jungles, last trampled death Keddah. It well nonsense ends safely. Next week catching over, plains sent back stations. Then march smooth roads, forget hunting. But, son, I angry thou shouldst meddle business belongs dirty Assamese jungle folk. Kala Nag obey none me, I must go Keddah, he fighting elephant, he help rope them. So I sit ease, befits mahout,--not mere hunter,--a mahout, I say, man gets pension end his service. Is family Toomai Elephants trodden underfoot dirt Keddah? Bad one! Wicked one! Worthless son! Go wash Kala Nag attend his ears, see thorns his feet. Or else Petersen Sahib surely catch thee make thee wild hunter--a follower elephant’s foot tracks, jungle bear. Bah! Shame! Go!” Little Toomai went without saying word, he told Kala Nag his grievances he examining his feet. “No matter,” said Little Toomai, turning fringe Kala Nag’s huge right ear. “They said name Petersen Sahib, perhaps--and perhaps--and perhaps--who knows? Hai! That big thorn I pulled out!” The next days spent getting elephants together, walking newly caught wild elephants couple tame ones prevent giving much trouble downward march plains, taking stock blankets ropes things worn lost forest. Petersen Sahib came his clever she-elephant Pudmini; he paying camps among hills, season coming end, native clerk sitting table tree, pay drivers wages. As man paid he went back his elephant, joined line stood ready start. The catchers, hunters, beaters, men regular Keddah, stayed jungle year year out, sat backs elephants belonged Petersen Sahib’s permanent force, leaned trees guns across arms, made fun drivers going away, laughed newly caught elephants broke line ran about. Big Toomai went clerk Little Toomai behind him, Machua Appa, head tracker, said undertone friend his, “There goes one piece good elephant stuff least. ‘It Is pity send young jungle-cock molt plains.” Now Petersen Sahib ears him, man must listens silent living things--the wild elephant. He turned he lying along Pudmini’s back said, “What that? I know man among plains-drivers wit enough rope even dead elephant.” “This man, boy. He went Keddah last drive, threw Barmao rope, trying get young calf blotch his shoulder away his mother.” Machua Appa pointed Little Toomai, Petersen Sahib looked, Little Toomai bowed earth. “He throw rope? He smaller picket-pin. Little one, thy name?” said Petersen Sahib. Little Toomai frightened speak, Kala Nag behind him, Toomai made sign his hand, elephant caught his trunk held level Pudmini’s forehead, front great Petersen Sahib. Then Little Toomai covered his face his hands, he child, except elephants concerned, he bashful child could be. “Oho!” said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his mustache, “and didst thou teach thy elephant trick? Was help thee steal green corn roofs houses ears put dry?” “Not green corn, Protector Poor,--melons,” said Little Toomai, men sitting broke roar laughter. Most taught elephants trick boys. Little Toomai hanging eight feet air, he wished much he eight feet underground. “He Toomai, son, Sahib,” said Big Toomai, scowling. “He bad boy, he end jail, Sahib.” “Of I doubts,” said Petersen Sahib. “A boy face full Keddah his age end jails. See, little one, four annas spend sweetmeats thou hast little head great thatch hair. In time thou mayest become hunter too.” Big Toomai scowled ever. “Remember, though, Keddahs good children play in,” Petersen Sahib went on. “Must I never go there, Sahib?” asked Little Toomai big gasp. “Yes.” Petersen Sahib smiled again. “When thou hast seen elephants dance. That proper time. Come thou hast seen elephants dance, I let thee go Keddahs.” There another roar laughter, old joke among elephant-catchers, means never. There great cleared flat places hidden away forests called elephants’ ball-rooms, even found accident, man ever seen elephants dance. When driver boasts his skill bravery drivers say, “And didst thou see elephants dance?” Kala Nag put Little Toomai down, he bowed earth went away his father, gave silver four-anna piece his mother, nursing his baby brother, put Kala Nag’s back, line grunting, squealing elephants rolled hill path plains. It lively march account new elephants, gave trouble every ford, needed coaxing beating every minute. Big Toomai prodded Kala Nag spitefully, he angry, Little Toomai happy speak. Petersen Sahib noticed him, given money, he felt private soldier would feel he called ranks praised his commander-in-chief. “What Petersen Sahib mean elephant dance?” he said, last, softly his mother. Big Toomai heard grunted. “That thou shouldst never one hill buffaloes trackers. That he meant. Oh, front, blocking way?” An Assamese driver, two three elephants ahead, turned round angrily, crying: “Bring Kala Nag, knock youngster mine good behavior. Why Petersen Sahib chosen go donkeys rice fields? Lay beast alongside, Toomai, let prod his tusks. By Gods Hills, new elephants possessed, else smell companions jungle.” Kala Nag hit new elephant ribs knocked wind him, Big Toomai said, “We swept hills wild elephants last catch. It carelessness driving. Must I keep order along whole line?” “Hear him!” said driver. “We swept hills! Ho! Ho! You wise, plains people. Anyone mud-head never saw jungle would know know drives ended season. Therefore wild elephants to-night will--but I waste wisdom river-turtle?” “What do?” Little Toomai called out. “Ohe, little one. Art thou there? Well, I tell thee, thou hast cool head. They dance, behooves thy father, swept hills elephants, double-chain his pickets to-night.” “What talk this?” said Big Toomai. “For forty years, father son, tended elephants, never heard moonshine dances.” “Yes; plainsman lives hut knows four walls his hut. Well, leave thy elephants unshackled tonight see comes. As dancing, I seen place where--Bapree-bap! How many windings Dihang River? Here another ford, must swim calves. Stop still, behind there.” And way, talking wrangling splashing rivers, made first march sort receiving camp new elephants. But lost tempers long got there. Then elephants chained hind legs big stumps pickets, extra ropes fitted new elephants, fodder piled them, hill drivers went back Petersen Sahib afternoon light, telling plains drivers extra careful night, laughing plains drivers asked reason. Little Toomai attended Kala Nag’s supper, evening fell, wandered camp, unspeakably happy, search tom-tom. When Indian child’s heart full, he run make noise irregular fashion. He sits sort revel himself. And Little Toomai spoken Petersen Sahib! If he found he wanted, I believe he would ill. But sweetmeat seller camp lent little tom-tom--a drum beaten flat hand--and he sat down, cross-legged, Kala Nag stars began come out, tom-tom his lap, he thumped he thumped he thumped, he thought great honor done him, he thumped, alone among elephant fodder. There tune words, thumping made happy. The new elephants strained ropes, squealed trumpeted time time, he could hear his mother camp hut putting his small brother sleep old, old song great God Shiv, told animals eat. It soothing lullaby, first verse says: Shiv, poured harvest made winds blow, Sitting doorways day long ago, Gave his portion, food toil fate, From King upon guddee Beggar gate. All things made he--Shiva Preserver. Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He made all-- Thorn camel, fodder kine, And mother’s heart sleepy head, O little son mine! Little Toomai came joyous tunk-a-tunk end verse, till he felt sleepy stretched fodder Kala Nag’s side. At last elephants began lie one another custom, till Kala Nag right line left standing up; he rocked slowly side side, his ears put forward listen night wind blew slowly across hills. The air full night noises that, taken together, make one big silence--the click one bamboo stem other, rustle something alive undergrowth, scratch squawk half-waked bird (birds awake night much often imagine), fall water ever far away. Little Toomai slept time, he waked brilliant moonlight, Kala Nag still standing his ears cocked. Little Toomai turned, rustling fodder, watched curve his big back half stars heaven, he watched he heard, far away sounded pinhole noise pricked stillness, “hoot-toot” wild elephant. All elephants lines jumped shot, grunts last waked sleeping mahouts, came drove picket pegs big mallets, tightened rope knotted till quiet. One new elephant nearly grubbed his picket, Big Toomai took Kala Nag’s leg chain shackled elephant fore-foot hind-foot, slipped loop grass string round Kala Nag’s leg, told remember he tied fast. He knew he his father his grandfather done thing hundreds times before. Kala Nag answer order gurgling, he usually did. He stood still, looking across moonlight, his head little raised his ears spread like fans, great folds Garo hills. “Tend he grows restless night,” said Big Toomai Little Toomai, he went hut slept. Little Toomai going sleep, too, he heard coir string snap little “tang,” Kala Nag rolled his pickets slowly silently cloud rolls mouth valley. Little Toomai pattered him, barefooted, road moonlight, calling his breath, “Kala Nag! Kala Nag! Take you, O Kala Nag!” The elephant turned, without sound, took three strides back boy moonlight, put his trunk, swung his neck, almost Little Toomai settled his knees, slipped forest. There one blast furious trumpeting lines, silence shut everything, Kala Nag began move. Sometimes tuft high grass washed along his sides wave washes along sides ship, sometimes cluster wild-pepper vines would scrape along his back, bamboo would creak his shoulder touched it. But times he moved absolutely without sound, drifting thick Garo forest though smoke. He going uphill, though Little Toomai watched stars rifts trees, he could tell direction. Then Kala Nag reached crest ascent stopped minute, Little Toomai could see tops trees lying speckled furry moonlight miles miles, blue-white mist river hollow. Toomai leaned forward looked, he felt forest awake him--awake alive crowded. A big brown fruit-eating bat brushed past his ear; porcupine’s quills rattled thicket; darkness tree stems he heard hog-bear digging hard moist warm earth, snuffing digged. Then branches closed his head again, Kala Nag began go valley--not quietly time, runaway gun goes steep bank--in one rush. The huge limbs moved steadily pistons, eight feet stride, wrinkled skin elbow points rustled. The undergrowth either side ripped noise like torn canvas, saplings he heaved away right left his shoulders sprang back banged flank, great trails creepers, matted together, hung his tusks he threw his head side side plowed his pathway. Then Little Toomai laid close great neck lest swinging bough sweep ground, he wished he back lines again. The grass began get squashy, Kala Nag’s feet sucked squelched he put down, night mist bottom valley chilled Little Toomai. There splash trample, rush running water, Kala Nag strode bed river, feeling his way step. Above noise water, swirled round elephant’s legs, Little Toomai could hear splashing trumpeting upstream down--great grunts angry snortings, mist seemed full rolling, wavy shadows. “Ai!” he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering. “The elephant-folk tonight. It dance, then!” Kala Nag swashed water, blew his trunk clear, began another climb. But time he alone, he make his path. That made already, six feet wide, front him, bent jungle-grass trying recover stand up. Many elephants must gone way minutes before. Little Toomai looked back, behind great wild tusker his little pig’s eyes glowing like hot coals lifting misty river. Then trees closed again, went up, trumpetings crashings, sound breaking branches every side them. At last Kala Nag stood still two tree-trunks top hill. They part circle trees grew round irregular space three four acres, space, Little Toomai could see, ground trampled hard brick floor. Some trees grew center clearing, bark rubbed away, white wood beneath showed shiny polished patches moonlight. There creepers hanging upper branches, bells flowers creepers, great waxy white things like convolvuluses, hung fast asleep. But within limits clearing single blade green--nothing trampled earth. The moonlight showed iron gray, except elephants stood upon it, shadows inky black. Little Toomai looked, holding his breath, his eyes starting his head, he looked, elephants swung open tree trunks. Little Toomai could count ten, he counted his fingers till he lost count tens, his head began swim. Outside clearing he could hear crashing undergrowth worked way hillside, soon within circle tree trunks moved like ghosts. There white-tusked wild males, fallen leaves nuts twigs lying wrinkles necks folds ears; fat, slow-footed she-elephants, restless, little pinky black calves three four feet high running stomachs; young elephants tusks beginning show, proud them; lanky, scraggy old-maid elephants, hollow anxious faces, trunks like rough bark; savage old bull elephants, scarred shoulder flank great weals cuts bygone fights, caked dirt solitary mud baths dropping shoulders; one broken tusk marks full-stroke, terrible drawing scrape, tiger’s claws his side. They standing head head, walking fro across ground couples, rocking swaying themselves--scores scores elephants. Toomai knew long he lay still Kala Nag’s neck nothing would happen him, even rush scramble Keddah drive wild elephant reach his trunk drag man neck tame elephant. And elephants thinking men night. Once started put ears forward heard chinking leg iron forest, Pudmini, Petersen Sahib’s pet elephant, her chain snapped short off, grunting, snuffling hillside. She must broken her pickets come straight Petersen Sahib’s camp; Little Toomai saw another elephant, one he know, deep rope galls his back breast. He, too, must run away camp hills about. At last sound elephants moving forest, Kala Nag rolled his station trees went middle crowd, clucking gurgling, elephants began talk tongue, move about. Still lying down, Little Toomai looked upon scores scores broad backs, wagging ears, tossing trunks, little rolling eyes. He heard click tusks crossed tusks accident, dry rustle trunks twined together, chafing enormous sides shoulders crowd, incessant flick hissh great tails. Then cloud came moon, he sat black darkness. But quiet, steady hustling pushing gurgling went same. He knew elephants round Kala Nag, chance backing assembly; he set his teeth shivered. In Keddah least torchlight shouting, he alone dark, trunk came touched knee. Then elephant trumpeted, took five ten terrible seconds. The dew trees spattered like rain unseen backs, dull booming noise began, loud first, Little Toomai could tell was. But grew grew, Kala Nag lifted one forefoot other, brought ground--one-two, one-two, steadily trip-hammers. The elephants stamping together now, sounded like war drum beaten mouth cave. The dew fell trees till left fall, booming went on, ground rocked shivered, Little Toomai put his hands his ears shut sound. But one gigantic jar ran him--this stamp hundreds heavy feet raw earth. Once twice he could feel Kala Nag others surge forward strides, thumping would change crushing sound juicy green things bruised, minute two boom feet hard earth began again. A tree creaking groaning somewhere near him. He put his arm felt bark, Kala Nag moved forward, still tramping, he could tell he clearing. There sound elephants, except once, two three little calves squeaked together. Then he heard thump shuffle, booming went on. It must lasted fully two hours, Little Toomai ached every nerve, he knew smell night air dawn coming. The morning broke one sheet pale yellow behind green hills, booming stopped first ray, though light order. Before Little Toomai got ringing his head, even he shifted his position, elephant sight except Kala Nag, Pudmini, elephant rope-galls, neither sign rustle whisper hillsides show others gone. Little Toomai stared again. The clearing, he remembered it, grown night. More trees stood middle it, undergrowth jungle grass sides rolled back. Little Toomai stared more. Now he understood trampling. The elephants stamped room--had stamped thick grass juicy cane trash, trash slivers, slivers tiny fibers, fibers hard earth. “Wah!” said Little Toomai, his eyes heavy. “Kala Nag, lord, let us keep Pudmini go Petersen Sahib’s camp, I shall drop thy neck.” The third elephant watched two go away, snorted, wheeled round, took his path. He may belonged little native king’s establishment, fifty sixty hundred miles away. Two hours later, Petersen Sahib eating early breakfast, his elephants, double chained night, began trumpet, Pudmini, mired shoulders, Kala Nag, footsore, shambled camp. Little Toomai’s face gray pinched, his hair full leaves drenched dew, he tried salute Petersen Sahib, cried faintly: “The dance--the elephant dance! I seen it, and--I die!” As Kala Nag sat down, he slid his neck dead faint. But, since native children nerves worth speaking of, two hours he lying contentedly Petersen Sahib’s hammock Petersen Sahib’s shooting-coat his head, glass warm milk, little brandy, dash quinine, inside him, old hairy, scarred hunters jungles sat three deep him, looking though he spirit, he told his tale short words, child will, wound with: “Now, I lie one word, send men see, find elephant folk trampled room dance-room, find ten ten, many times ten, tracks leading dance-room. They made room feet. I seen it. Kala Nag took me, I saw. Also Kala Nag leg-weary!” Little Toomai lay back slept long afternoon twilight, he slept Petersen Sahib Machua Appa followed track two elephants fifteen miles across hills. Petersen Sahib spent eighteen years catching elephants, he found dance-place. Machua Appa need look twice clearing see done there, scratch his toe packed, rammed earth. “The child speaks truth,” said he. “All done last night, I counted seventy tracks crossing river. See, Sahib, Pudmini’s leg-iron cut bark tree! Yes; she too.” They looked one another down, wondered. For ways elephants beyond wit man, black white, fathom. “Forty years five,” said Machua Appa, “have I followed lord, elephant, never I heard child man seen child seen. By Gods Hills, is--what say?” he shook his head. When got back camp time evening meal. Petersen Sahib ate alone his tent, he gave orders camp two sheep fowls, well double ration flour rice salt, he knew would feast. Big Toomai come hotfoot camp plains search his son his elephant, he found he looked though he afraid both. And feast blazing campfires front lines picketed elephants, Little Toomai hero all. And big brown elephant catchers, trackers drivers ropers, men know secrets breaking wildest elephants, passed one other, marked his forehead blood breast newly killed jungle-cock, show he forester, initiated free jungles. And last, flames died down, red light logs made elephants look though dipped blood too, Machua Appa, head drivers Keddahs--Machua Appa, Petersen Sahib’s self, never seen made road forty years: Machua Appa, great he name Machua Appa,--leaped his feet, Little Toomai held high air his head, shouted: “Listen, brothers. Listen, too, lords lines there, I, Machua Appa, speaking! This little one shall called Little Toomai, Toomai Elephants, his great-grandfather called him. What never man seen he seen long night, favor elephant-folk Gods Jungles him. He shall become great tracker. He shall become greater I, even I, Machua Appa! He shall follow new trail, stale trail, mixed trail, clear eye!

Aihai! lords chains,”--he whirled line pickets--“here little one seen dances hidden places,--the sight never man saw! Give honor, lords! Salaam karo, children. Make salute Toomai Elephants! Gunga Pershad, ahaa! Hira Guj, Birchi Guj, Kuttar Guj, ahaa! Pudmini,--thou hast seen dance, thou too, Kala Nag, pearl among elephants!--ahaa! Together! To Toomai Elephants. Barrao!” And last wild yell whole line flung trunks till tips touched foreheads, broke full salute--the crashing trumpet-peal Viceroy India hears, Salaamut Keddah. But sake Little Toomai, seen never man seen before--the dance elephants night alone heart Garo hills! Shiv Grasshopper (The song Toomai’s mother sang baby) Shiv, poured harvest made winds blow, Sitting doorways day long ago, Gave his portion, food toil fate, From King upon guddee Beggar gate. All things made he--Shiva Preserver. Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He made all,-- Thorn camel, fodder kine, And mother’s heart sleepy head, O little son mine! Wheat he gave rich folk, millet poor, Broken scraps holy men beg door door; Battle tiger, carrion kite, And rags bones wicked wolves without wall night. Naught he found lofty, none he saw low-- Parbati beside watched come go; Thought cheat her husband, turning Shiv jest-- Stole little grasshopper hid her breast. So she tricked him, Shiva Preserver. Mahadeo! Mahadeo! Turn see. Tall camels, heavy kine, But Least Little Things, O little son mine! When dole ended, laughingly she said, “Master, million mouths, one unfed?” Laughing, Shiv made answer, “All part, Even he, little one, hidden ‘neath thy heart.” From her breast she plucked it, Parbati thief, Saw Least Little Things gnawed new-grown leaf!

You twist it, turn it, plait till drop, But way Pilly Winky’s way Winkie Pop! It raining heavily one whole month--raining camp thirty thousand men thousands camels, elephants, horses, bullocks, mules gathered together place called Rawal Pindi, reviewed Viceroy India. He receiving visit Amir Afghanistan--a wild king wild country. The Amir brought bodyguard eight hundred men horses never seen camp locomotive lives--savage men savage horses somewhere back Central Asia. Every night mob horses would sure break heel ropes stampede camp mud dark, camels would break loose run fall ropes tents, imagine pleasant men trying go sleep. My tent lay far away camel lines, I thought safe. But one night man popped his head shouted, “Get out, quick! They are coming! My tent’s gone!” I knew “they” were, I put boots waterproof scuttled slush. Little Vixen, fox terrier, went side; roaring grunting bubbling, I saw tent cave in, pole snapped, begin dance like mad ghost. A camel blundered it, wet angry I was, I could help laughing. Then I ran on, I know many camels might got loose, long I sight camp, plowing way mud. At last I fell tail-end gun, knew I somewhere near artillery lines cannon stacked night. As I want plowter drizzle dark, I put waterproof muzzle one gun, made sort wigwam two three rammers I found, lay along tail another gun, wondering Vixen got to, I might be. Just I getting ready go sleep I heard jingle harness grunt, mule passed shaking his wet ears. He belonged screw-gun battery, I could hear rattle straps rings chains things his saddle pad. The screw-guns tiny little cannon made two pieces, screwed together time comes use them. They taken mountains, anywhere mule find road, useful fighting rocky country. Behind mule camel, his big soft feet squelching slipping mud, his neck bobbing fro like strayed hen’s. Luckily, I knew enough beast language--not wild-beast language, camp-beast language, course--from natives know he saying. He must one flopped tent, he called mule, “What shall I do? Where shall I go? I fought white thing waved, took stick hit neck.” (That broken tent pole, I glad know it.) “Shall run on?” “Oh, you,” said mule, “you friends, disturbing camp? All right. You will beaten morning. But I may well give something account now.” I heard harness jingle mule backed caught camel two kicks ribs rang like drum. “Another time,” he said, “you will know better run mule battery night, shouting `Thieves fire!’ Sit down, keep silly neck quiet.” The camel doubled camel-fashion, like two-foot rule, sat whimpering. There regular beat hoofs darkness, big troop-horse cantered steadily though he parade, jumped gun tail, landed close mule. “It is disgraceful,” he said, blowing his nostrils. “Those camels racketed lines again--the third time week. How is horse keep his condition he is not allowed sleep. Who is here?” “I am breech-piece mule number two gun First Screw Battery,” said mule, “and other’s one friends. He is waked too. Who you?” “Number Fifteen, E troop, Ninth Lancers--Dick Cunliffe’s horse. Stand little, there.” “Oh, beg pardon,” said mule. “It is dark see much. Are not camels sickening anything? I walked lines get little peace quiet here.” “My lords,” said camel humbly, “we dreamed bad dreams night, much afraid. I baggage camel 39th Native Infantry, I brave are, lords.” “Then did not stay carry baggage 39th Native Infantry, instead running round camp?” said mule. “They bad dreams,” said camel. “I sorry. Listen! What that? Shall run again?” “Sit down,” said mule, “or you will snap long stick-legs guns.” He cocked one ear listened. “Bullocks!” he said. “Gun bullocks. On word, friends waked camp thoroughly. It takes good deal prodding put gun-bullock.” I heard chain dragging along ground, yoke great sulky white bullocks drag heavy siege guns elephants will not go nearer firing, came shouldering along together. And almost stepping chain another battery mule, calling wildly “Billy.” “That is one recruits,” said old mule troop horse. “He is calling me. Here, youngster, stop squealing. The dark never hurt anybody yet.” The gun-bullocks lay together began chewing cud, young mule huddled close Billy. “Things!” he said. “Fearful horrible, Billy! They came lines asleep. D’you think they will kill us?” “I have great mind give number-one kicking,” said Billy. “The idea fourteen-hand mule training disgracing battery gentleman!” “Gently, gently!” said troop-horse. “Remember always like begin with. The first time I ever saw man (it Australia I three-year-old) I ran half day, I would seen camel, I running still.” Nearly horses English cavalry brought India Australia, broken troopers themselves. “True enough,” said Billy. “Stop shaking, youngster. The first time put full harness chains back I stood forelegs kicked every bit off. I had not learned real science kicking then, battery said never seen anything like it.” “But was not harness anything jingled,” said young mule. “You know I do not mind now, Billy. It Things like trees, fell lines bubbled; head-rope broke, I could not find driver, I could not find you, Billy, I ran with--with gentlemen.” “H’m!” said Billy. “As soon I heard camels loose I came away account. When battery--a screw-gun mule calls gun-bullocks gentlemen, he must badly shaken up. Who fellows ground there?” The gun bullocks rolled cuds, answered together: “The seventh yoke first gun Big Gun Battery. We asleep camels came, trampled got walked away. It better lie quiet mud disturbed good bedding. We told friend nothing afraid of, he knew much he thought otherwise. Wah!” They went chewing. “That comes afraid,” said Billy. “You get laughed gun-bullocks. I hope like it, young un.” The young mule’s teeth snapped, I heard say something afraid beefy old bullock world. But bullocks clicked horns together went chewing. “Now, do not angry you have afraid. That is worst kind cowardice,” said troop-horse. “Anybody forgiven scared night, I think, see things do not understand. We have broken pickets, again, four hundred fifty us, new recruit got telling tales whip snakes home Australia till scared death loose ends head-ropes.” “That is well camp,” said Billy. “I am stampeding myself, fun thing, I have not day two. But active service?” “Oh, that is quite another set new shoes,” said troop horse. “Dick Cunliffe’s back then, drives his knees me, I watch I putting feet, keep hind legs well me, bridle-wise.” “What is bridle-wise?” said young mule. “By Blue Gums Back Blocks,” snorted troop-horse, “do mean say are not taught bridle-wise business? How anything, unless spin round rein pressed neck? It means life death man, course that is life death you. Get round hind legs instant feel rein neck. If have not room swing round, rear little come round hind legs. That is bridle-wise.” “We are not taught way,” said Billy mule stiffly. “We are taught obey man head: step he says so, step he says so. I suppose comes thing. Now, fine fancy business rearing, must bad hocks, do?” “That depends,” said troop-horse. “Generally I go among lot yelling, hairy men knives--long shiny knives, worse farrier’s knives--and I take care Dick’s boot touching next man’s boot without crushing it. I see Dick’s lance right right eye, I know I am safe. I should not care man horse stood Dick we are hurry.” “Do not knives hurt?” said young mule. “Well, I got one cut across chest once, was not Dick’s fault--” “A lot I cared whose fault was, hurt!” said young mule. “You must,” said troop horse. “If do not trust man, may well run away once. That is horses do, I do not blame them. As I saying, was not Dick’s fault. The man lying ground, I stretched tread him, he slashed me. Next time I go man lying I shall step him--hard.” “H’m!” said Billy. “It sounds foolish. Knives dirty things time. The proper thing climb mountain well-balanced saddle, hang four feet ears too, creep crawl wriggle along, till come hundreds feet anyone else ledge there is room enough hoofs. Then stand still keep quiet--never ask man hold head, young un--keep quiet guns put together, watch little poppy shells drop tree-tops ever far below.” “Do not ever trip?” said troop-horse. “They say mule trips split hen’s ear,” said Billy. “Now perhaps badly packed saddle upset mule, it is seldom. I wish I could show business. It is beautiful. Why, took three years find men driving at. The science thing never show sky line, because, do, may get fired at. Remember that, young un. Always keep hidden much possible, even go mile way. I lead battery comes sort climbing.” “Fired without chance running people firing!” said troop-horse, thinking hard. “I could not stand that. I want charge--with Dick.” “Oh, no, would not. You know soon guns position they will charging. That is scientific neat. But knives--pah!” The baggage-camel bobbing his head fro time past, anxious get word edgewise. Then I heard say, he cleared his throat, nervously: “I--I--I fought little, climbing way running way.” “No. Now mention it,” said Billy, “you do not look though made climbing running--much. Well, it, old Hay-bales?” “The proper way,” said camel. “We sat down--” “Oh, crupper breastplate!” said troop-horse his breath. “Sat down!” “We sat down--a hundred us,” camel went on, “in big square, men piled packs saddles, outside square, fired backs, men did, sides square.” “What sort men? Any men came along?” said troop-horse. “They teach us riding school lie let masters fire across us, Dick Cunliffe man I would trust that. It tickles girths, and, besides, I cannot see head ground.” “What matter fires across you?” said camel. “There plenty men plenty camels close by, great many clouds smoke. I frightened then. I sit still wait.” “And yet,” said Billy, “you dream bad dreams upset camp night. Well, well! Before I would lie down, speak sitting down, let man fire across me, heels his head would something say other. Did ever hear anything awful that?” There long silence, one gun bullocks lifted his big head said, “This foolish indeed. There one way fighting.” “Oh, go on,” said Billy. “Please do not mind me. I suppose fellows fight standing tails?” “Only one way,” said two together. (They must twins.) “This way. To put twenty yoke us big gun soon Two Tails trumpets.” (“Two Tails” camp slang elephant.) “What Two Tails trumpet for?” said young mule. “To show he going nearer smoke side. Two Tails great coward. Then tug big gun together--Heya--Hullah! Heeyah! Hullah! We climb like cats run like calves. We go across level plain, twenty yoke us, till unyoked again, graze big guns talk across plain town mud walls, pieces wall fall out, dust goes though many cattle coming home.” “Oh! And choose time grazing?” said young mule. “That time other. Eating always good. We eat till yoked tug gun back Two Tails waiting it. Sometimes big guns city speak back, us killed, grazing left. This Fate. None less, Two Tails great coward. That proper way fight. We brothers Hapur. Our father sacred bull Shiva. We spoken.” “Well, I have certainly learned something tonight,” said troop-horse. “Do gentlemen screw-gun battery feel inclined eat fired big guns, Two Tails behind you?” “About much feel inclined sit let men sprawl us, run people knives. I never heard stuff. A mountain ledge, well-balanced load, driver trust let pick way, I am mule. But--the things--no!” said Billy, stamp his foot. “Of course,” said troop horse, “everyone made way, I quite see family, father’s side, would fail understand great many things.” “Never mind family father’s side,” said Billy angrily, every mule hates reminded his father donkey. “My father Southern gentleman, he could pull bite kick rags every horse he came across. Remember that, big brown Brumby!” Brumby means wild horse without breeding. Imagine feelings Sunol car-horse called her “skate,” imagine Australian horse felt. I saw white his eye glitter dark. “See here, son imported Malaga jackass,” he said his teeth, “I would know I am related mother’s side Carbine, winner Melbourne Cup, I come are not accustomed ridden roughshod parrot-mouthed, pig-headed mule pop-gun pea-shooter battery. Are ready?” “On hind legs!” squealed Billy. They reared facing other, I expecting furious fight, gurgly, rumbly voice, called darkness right--“Children, fighting there? Be quiet.” Both beasts dropped snort disgust, neither horse mule bear listen elephant’s voice. “It is Two Tails!” said troop-horse. “I cannot stand him. A tail end is not fair!” “My feelings exactly,” said Billy, crowding troop-horse company. “We are alike things.” “I suppose we have inherited mothers,” said troop horse. “It is worth quarreling about. Hi! Two Tails, tied up?” “Yes,” said Two Tails, laugh his trunk. “I am picketed night. I have heard fellows saying. But do not afraid. I am coming over.” The bullocks camel said, half aloud, “Afraid Two Tails--what nonsense!” And bullocks went on, “We sorry heard, true. Two Tails, afraid guns fire?” “Well,” said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg other, exactly like little boy saying poem, “I do not quite know whether you would understand.” “We do not, pull guns,” said bullocks. “I know it, I know good deal braver think are. But it is different me. My battery captain called Pachydermatous Anachronism day.” “That is another way fighting, I suppose?” said Billy, recovering his spirits. “You do not know means, course, I do. It means betwixt between, I am. I see inside head happen she will bursts, bullocks cannot.” “I can,” said troop-horse. “At least little bit. I try think it.” “I see you, I think it. I know there is great deal take care of, I know nobody knows cure I am sick. All stop driver’s pay till I get well, I cannot trust driver.” “Ah!” said troop horse. “That explains it. I trust Dick.” “You could put whole regiment Dicks back without making feel better. I know enough uncomfortable, enough go spite it.” “We understand,” said bullocks. “I know do not. I am talking you. You do not know blood is.” “We do,” said bullocks. “It red stuff soaks ground smells.” The troop-horse gave kick bound snort. “Do not talk it,” he said. “I smell now, thinking it. It makes want run--when I have not Dick back.” “But here,” said camel bullocks. “Why stupid?” “It is vile stuff,” said Billy. “I do not want run, I do not want talk it.” “There are!” said Two Tails, waving his tail explain. “Surely. Yes, night,” said bullocks. Two Tails stamped his foot till iron ring jingled. “Oh, I am talking you. You cannot see inside heads.” “No. We see four eyes,” said bullocks. “We see straight front us.” “If I could nothing else, would not needed pull big guns all. If I like captain--he see things inside his head firing begins, he shakes over, he knows much run away--if I like I could pull guns. But I wise I never here. I king forest, I used be, sleeping half day bathing I liked. I have not good bath month.” “That is fine,” said Billy. “But giving thing long name does not make better.” “H’sh!” said troop horse. “I think I understand Two Tails means.” “You will understand better minute,” said Two Tails angrily. “Now explain do not like this!” He began trumpeting furiously top his trumpet. “Stop that!” said Billy troop horse together, I could hear stamp shiver. An elephant’s trumpeting always nasty, especially dark night. “I shall not stop,” said Two Tails. “Will not explain that, please? Hhrrmph! Rrrt! Rrrmph! Rrrhha!” Then he stopped suddenly, I heard little whimper dark, knew Vixen found last. She knew well I one thing world elephant afraid another little barking dog. So she stopped bully Two Tails his pickets, yapped round his big feet. Two Tails shuffled squeaked. “Go away, little dog!” he said. “Do not snuff ankles, I will kick you. Good little dog--nice little doggie, then! Go home, yelping little beast! Oh, does not someone take her away? She will bite minute.” “Seems me,” said Billy troop horse, “that friend Two Tails afraid things. Now, I full meal every dog I have kicked across parade-ground I fat Two Tails nearly.” I whistled, Vixen ran me, muddy over, licked nose, told long tale hunting camp. I never let her know I understood beast talk, she would taken sorts liberties. So I buttoned her breast overcoat, Two Tails shuffled stamped growled himself. “Extraordinary! Most extraordinary!” he said. “It runs family. Now, nasty little beast gone to?” I heard feeling his trunk. “We seem affected various ways,” he went on, blowing his nose. “Now, gentlemen alarmed, I believe, I trumpeted.” “Not alarmed, exactly,” said troop-horse, “but made feel though I hornets saddle ought be. Do not begin again.” “I am frightened little dog, camel frightened bad dreams night.” “It lucky us have not got fight way,” said troop-horse. “What I want know,” said young mule, quiet long time--“what I want know is, fight all.” “Because we are told to,” said troop-horse, snort contempt. “Orders,” said Billy mule, his teeth snapped. “Hukm hai!” (It order!), said camel gurgle, Two Tails bullocks repeated, “Hukm hai!” “Yes, gives orders?” said recruit-mule. “The man walks head--Or sits back--Or holds nose rope--Or twists tail,” said Billy troop-horse camel bullocks one other. “But gives orders?” “Now want know much, young un,” said Billy, “and one way getting kicked. All obey man head ask questions.” “He is quite right,” said Two Tails. “I cannot always obey, I am betwixt between. But Billy’s right. Obey man next gives order, you will stop battery, besides getting thrashing.” The gun-bullocks got go. “Morning coming,” said. “We go back lines. It true see eyes, clever. But still, people to-night afraid. Good-night, brave people.” Nobody answered, troop-horse said, change conversation, “Where is little dog? A dog means man somewhere about.” “Here I am,” yapped Vixen, “under gun tail man. You big, blundering beast camel you, upset tent. My man’s angry.” “Phew!” said bullocks. “He must white!” “Of course he is,” said Vixen. “Do suppose I am looked black bullock-driver?” “Huah! Ouach! Ugh!” said bullocks. “Let us get away quickly.” They plunged forward mud, managed somehow run yoke pole ammunition wagon, jammed. “Now done it,” said Billy calmly. “Do not struggle. You are hung till daylight. What earth’s matter?” The bullocks went long hissing snorts Indian cattle give, pushed crowded slued stamped slipped nearly fell mud, grunting savagely. “You will break necks minute,” said troop-horse. “What is matter white men? I live ‘them.” “They--eat--us! Pull!” said near bullock. The yoke snapped twang, lumbered together. I never knew made Indian cattle scared Englishmen. We eat beef--a thing cattle-driver touches--and course cattle like it. “May I flogged pad-chains! Who would thought two big lumps like losing heads?” said Billy. “Never mind. I am going look man. Most white men, I know, things pockets,” said troop-horse. “I will leave you, then. I cannot say I am over-fond ‘them myself. Besides, white men have not place sleep likely thieves, I have good deal Government property back. Come along, young un, we will go back lines. Good-night, Australia! See parade to-morrow, I suppose. Good-night, old Hay-bale!--try control feelings, will not you? Good-night, Two Tails! If pass us ground tomorrow, do not trumpet. It spoils formation.” Billy Mule stumped swaggering limp old campaigner, troop-horse’s head came nuzzling breast, I gave biscuits, Vixen, conceited little dog, told fibs scores horses she I kept. “I am coming parade to-morrow dog-cart,” she said. “Where be?” “On left hand second squadron. I set time troop, little lady,” he said politely. “Now I must go back Dick. My tail’s muddy, he will two hours’ hard work dressing parade.” The big parade thirty thousand men held afternoon, Vixen I good place close Viceroy Amir Afghanistan, high, big black hat astrakhan wool great diamond star center. The first part review sunshine, regiments went wave upon wave legs moving together, guns line, till eyes grew dizzy. Then cavalry came up, beautiful cavalry canter “Bonnie Dundee,” Vixen cocked her ear she sat dog-cart. The second squadron Lancers shot by, troop-horse, his tail like spun silk, his head pulled his breast, one ear forward one back, setting time his squadron, his legs going smoothly waltz music. Then big guns came by, I saw Two Tails two elephants harnessed line forty-pounder siege gun, twenty yoke oxen walked behind. The seventh pair new yoke, looked rather stiff tired. Last came screw guns, Billy mule carried though he commanded troops, his harness oiled polished till winked. I gave cheer Billy mule, he never looked right left. The rain began fall again, misty see troops doing. They made big half circle across plain, spreading line. That line grew grew grew till three-quarters mile long wing wing--one solid wall men, horses, guns. Then came straight toward Viceroy Amir, got nearer ground began shake, like deck steamer engines going fast. Unless cannot imagine frightening effect steady come-down troops spectators, even know review. I looked Amir. Up till he shown shadow sign astonishment anything else. But his eyes began get bigger bigger, he picked reins his horse’s neck looked behind him. For minute seemed though he going draw his sword slash his way English men women carriages back. Then advance stopped dead, ground stood still, whole line saluted, thirty bands began play together. That end review, regiments went camps rain, infantry band struck with-- The animals went two two, Hurrah! The animals went two two, The elephant battery mul’, got Ark For get rain! Then I heard old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief, come Amir, asking questions native officer. “Now,” said he, “in manner wonderful thing done?” And officer answered, “An order given, obeyed.” “But beasts wise men?” said chief. “They obey, men do. Mule, horse, elephant, bullock, he obeys his driver, driver his sergeant, sergeant his lieutenant, lieutenant his captain, captain his major, major his colonel, colonel his brigadier commanding three regiments, brigadier general, obeys Viceroy, servant Empress. Thus done.” “Would Afghanistan!” said chief, “for obey wills.” “And reason,” said native officer, twirling his mustache, “your Amir obey must come take orders Viceroy.” Parade Song Camp Animals ELEPHANTS OF THE GUN TEAMS We lent Alexander strength Hercules, The wisdom foreheads, cunning knees; We bowed necks service: never loosed again,-- Make way there--way ten-foot teams Of Forty-Pounder train!
