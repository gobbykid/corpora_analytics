 THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER CHAPTER I HOW THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM OF THE BLACK BROTHERS WAS INTERFERED WITH BY SOUTHWEST WIND, ESQUIRE In secluded mountainous part Stiria old time valley surprising luxuriant fertility. It surrounded sides steep rocky mountains rising peaks always covered snow number torrents descended constant cataracts. One fell westward face crag high sun set everything else, darkness, his beams still shone full upon waterfall, looked like shower gold. It therefore called people neighborhood Golden River. It strange none streams fell valley itself. They descended side mountains wound away broad plains populous cities. But clouds drawn constantly snowy hills, rested softly circular hollow, time drought heat, country round burned up, still rain little valley; crops heavy, hay high, apples red, grapes blue, wine rich, honey sweet, marvel everyone beheld commonly called Treasure Valley. The whole little valley belonged three brothers, called Schwartz, Hans, Gluck. Schwartz Hans, two elder brothers, ugly men, overhanging eyebrows small, dull eyes always half shut, could not see THEM always fancied saw far YOU. They lived farming Treasure Valley, good farmers were. They killed everything pay eating. They shot blackbirds pecked fruit, killed hedgehogs lest suck cows; poisoned crickets eating crumbs kitchen, smothered cicadas used sing summer lime trees. They worked servants without wages till would work more, quarreled turned doors without paying them. It would odd farm system farming had not got rich; rich DID get. They generally contrived keep corn till dear, sell twice value; heaps gold lying floors, yet never known given much penny crust charity; never went Mass, grumbled perpetually paying tithes, were, word, cruel grinding temper receive dealings nickname "Black Brothers." The youngest brother, Gluck, completely opposed, appearance character, his seniors could possibly imagined desired. He twelve years old, fair, blue-eyed, kind temper every living thing. He not, course, agree particularly well his brothers, or, rather, agree HIM. He usually appointed honorable office turnspit, anything roast, often, for, brothers justice, hardly less sparing upon upon people. At times he used clean shoes, floors, sometimes plates, occasionally getting left them, way encouragement, wholesome quantity dry blows way education. Things went manner long time. At last came wet summer, everything went wrong country round. The hay hardly got haystacks floated bodily sea inundation; vines cut pieces hail; corn killed black blight. Only Treasure Valley, usual, safe. As rain rain nowhere else, sun sun nowhere else. Everybody came buy corn farm went away pouring maledictions Black Brothers. They asked liked got it, except poor people, could beg, several starved door without slightest regard notice. It drawing towards winter, cold weather, one day two elder brothers gone out, usual warning little Gluck, left mind roast, he let nobody give nothing out. Gluck sat quite close fire, raining hard kitchen walls means dry comfortable-looking. He turned turned, roast got nice brown. "What pity," thought Gluck, "my brothers never ask anybody dinner. I am sure, they have got nice piece mutton this, nobody else got much piece dry bread, would hearts good somebody eat them." Just he spoke came double knock house door, yet heavy dull, though knocker tied up--more like puff knock. "It must wind," said Gluck; "nobody else would venture knock double knocks door." No, was not wind; came hard, and, particularly astounding, knocker seemed hurry least afraid consequences. Gluck went window, opened it, put his head see was. It extraordinary-looking little gentleman he ever seen his life. He large nose, slightly brass-colored; his cheeks round red, might warranted supposition he blowing refractory fire last eight-and-forty hours; his eyes twinkled merrily long, silky eyelashes; his mustaches curled twice round like corkscrew side his mouth; his hair, curious mixed pepper-and-salt color, descended far his shoulders. He four feet six height wore conical pointed cap nearly altitude, decorated black feather three feet long. His doublet prolonged behind something resembling violent exaggeration termed "swallowtail," much obscured swelling folds enormous black, glossy-looking cloak, must much long calm weather, wind, whistling round old house, carried clear wearer's shoulders four times his length. Gluck perfectly paralyzed singular appearance his visitor he remained fixed without uttering word, old gentleman, performed another energetic concerto knocker, turned round look his flyaway cloak. In he caught sight Gluck's little yellow head jammed window, mouth eyes wide open indeed. "Hollo!" said little gentleman; "that is way answer door. I am wet; let in." To little gentleman justice, he WAS wet. His feather hung his legs like beaten puppy's tail, dripping like umbrella, ends his mustaches water running his waistcoat pockets like mill stream. "I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck, "I am sorry, but, I really cannot." "Cannot what?" said old gentleman. "I cannot let in, sir--I cannot, indeed; brothers would beat death, sir, I thought thing. What want, sir?" "Want?" said old gentleman petulantly. "I want fire shelter, there is great fire blazing, crackling, dancing walls nobody feel it. Let in, I say; I want warm myself." Gluck his head, time, long window he began feel really unpleasantly cold, he turned saw beautiful fire rustling roaring throwing long, bright tongues chimney, licking chops savory smell leg mutton, his heart melted within burning away nothing. "He look wet," said little Gluck; "I will let quarter hour." Round he went door opened it; little gentleman walked in, came gust wind house made old chimneys totter. "That is good boy," said little gentleman. "Never mind brothers. I will talk them." "Pray, sir, do not thing," said Gluck. "I cannot let stay till come; they would death me." "Dear me," said old gentleman, "I am sorry hear that. How long may I stay?" "Only till mutton's done, sir," replied Gluck, "and it is brown." Then old gentleman walked kitchen sat hob, top his cap accommodated chimney, great deal high roof. "You will soon dry there, sir," said Gluck, sat turn mutton. But old gentleman NOT dry there, went drip, drip, dripping among cinders, fire fizzed sputtered began look black uncomfortable. Never cloak; every fold ran like gutter. "I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck length, watching water spreading long, quicksilver-like streams floor quarter hour; "may not I take cloak?" "No, thank you," said old gentleman. "Your cap, sir?" "I right, thank you," said old gentleman rather gruffly. "But--sir--I am sorry," said Gluck hesitatingly, "but--really, sir--you are--putting fire out." "It will take longer mutton, then," replied his visitor dryly. Gluck much puzzled behavior his guest; strange mixture coolness humility. He turned away string meditatively another five minutes. "That mutton looks nice," said old gentleman length. "Cannot give little bit?" "Impossible, sir," said Gluck. "I am hungry," continued old gentleman. "I have nothing eat yesterday to-day. They surely could not miss bit knuckle!" He spoke melancholy tone quite melted Gluck's heart. "They promised one slice to-day, sir," said he; "I give that, bit more." "That is good boy," said old gentleman again. Then Gluck warmed plate sharpened knife. "I do not care I get beaten it," thought he. Just he cut large slice mutton came tremendous rap door. The old gentleman jumped hob suddenly become inconveniently warm. Gluck fitted slice mutton again, desperate efforts exactitude, ran open door. "What keep us waiting rain for?" said Schwartz, he walked in, throwing his umbrella Gluck's face. "Aye! for, indeed, little vagabond?" said Hans, administering educational box ear he followed his brother kitchen. "Bless soul!" said Schwartz he opened door. "Amen," said little gentleman, taken his cap standing middle kitchen, bowing utmost possible velocity. "Who is that?" said Schwartz, catching rolling-pin turning Gluck fierce frown. "I do not know, indeed, brother," said Gluck great terror. "How he get in?" roared Schwartz. "My dear brother," said Gluck deprecatingly, "he VERY wet!" The rolling-pin descending Gluck's head, but, instant, old gentleman interposed his conical cap, crashed shock shook water room. What odd, rolling-pin sooner touched cap flew Schwartz's hand, spinning like straw high wind, fell corner end room. "Who you, sir?" demanded Schwartz, turning upon him. "What is business?" snarled Hans. "I am poor old man, sir," little gentleman began modestly, "and I saw fire window begged shelter quarter hour." "Have goodness walk again, then," said Schwartz. "We have quite enough water kitchen without making drying house." "It cold day turn old man in, sir; look gray hairs." They hung his shoulders, I told before. "Aye!" said Hans; "there enough keep warm. Walk!" "I am very, hungry, sir; could not spare bit bread I go?" "Bread, indeed!" said Schwartz; "do suppose we have nothing bread give red-nosed fellows you?" "Why do not sell feather?" said Hans sneeringly. "Out you!" "A little bit," said old gentleman. "Be off!" said Schwartz. "Pray, gentlemen." "Off, hanged!" cried Hans, seizing collar. But he sooner touched old gentleman's collar away he went rolling-pin, spinning round round till he fell corner top it. Then Schwartz angry ran old gentleman turn out; he also hardly touched away he went Hans rolling-pin, hit his head wall he tumbled corner. And lay, three. Then old gentleman spun round velocity opposite direction, continued spin his long cloak wound neatly him, clapped his cap his head, much one side (for could stand upright without going ceiling), gave additional twist his corkscrew mustaches, replied perfect coolness: "Gentlemen, I wish good morning. At twelve of the clock tonight I will call again; refusal hospitality I experienced, surprised visit last I ever pay you." "If ever I catch again," muttered Schwartz, coming, half frightened, corner--but he could finish his sentence old gentleman shut house door behind great bang, drove past window instant wreath ragged cloud whirled rolled away valley manner shapes, turning air melting away last gush rain. "A pretty business, indeed, Mr. Gluck!" said Schwartz. "Dish mutton, sir. If ever I catch trick again--bless me, why, mutton's cut!" "You promised one slice, brother, know," said Gluck. "Oh! cutting hot, I suppose, going catch gravy. It will long I promise thing again. Leave room, sir; kindness wait coal cellar till I call you." Gluck left room melancholy enough. The brothers ate much mutton could, locked rest cupboard, proceeded get drunk dinner. Such night was! Howling wind rushing rain, without intermission. The brothers sense enough left put shutters double-bar door went bed. They usually slept room. As clock struck twelve awakened tremendous crash. Their door burst open violence shook house top bottom. "What is that?" cried Schwartz, starting his bed. "Only I," said little gentleman. The two brothers sat bolster stared darkness. The room full water, misty moonbeam, found way hole shutter, could see midst enormous foam globe, spinning round bobbing like cork, which, luxurious cushion, reclined little old gentleman, cap all. There plenty room now, roof off. "Sorry incommode you," said visitor ironically. "I am afraid beds dampish. Perhaps better go brother's room; I have left ceiling there." They required second admonition, rushed Gluck's room, wet agony terror. "You will find card kitchen table," old gentleman called them. "Remember, LAST visit." "Pray Heaven may!" said Schwartz, shuddering. And foam globe disappeared. Dawn came last, two brothers looked Gluck's little window morning. The Treasure Valley one mass ruin desolation. The inundation swept away trees, crops, cattle, left stead waste red sand gray mud. The two brothers crept shivering horror-struck kitchen. The water gutted whole first floor; corn, money, almost every movable thing, swept away, left small white card kitchen table. On it, large, breezy, long-legged letters, engraved words: SOUTH WEST WIND, ESQUIRE CHAPTER II OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER THE VISIT OF SOUTHWEST WIND, ESQUIRE; AND HOW LITTLE GLUCK HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER Southwest Wind, Esquire, good his word. After momentous visit related, he entered Treasure Valley more; and, worse, he much influence his relations, West Winds general, used effectually, adopted similar line conduct. So rain fell valley one year's end another. Though everything remained green flourishing plains below, inheritance three brothers desert. What richest soil kingdom became shifting heap red sand, brothers, unable longer contend adverse skies, abandoned valueless patrimony despair, seek means gaining livelihood among cities people plains. All money gone, nothing left curious old-fashioned pieces gold plate, last remnants ill-gotten wealth. "Suppose turn goldsmiths," said Schwartz Hans entered large city. "It good knave's trade; put great deal copper gold without anyone's finding out." The thought agreed good one; hired furnace turned goldsmiths. But two slight circumstances affected trade: first, people approve coppered gold; second, two elder brothers, whenever sold anything, used leave little Gluck mind furnace, go drink money alehouse next door. So melted gold without making money enough buy more, last reduced one large drinking mug, uncle his given little Gluck, he fond would parted world, though he never drank anything milk water. The mug odd mug look at. The handle formed two wreaths flowing golden hair, finely spun looked like silk metal, wreaths descended mixed beard whiskers exquisite workmanship, surrounded decorated fierce little face, reddest gold imaginable, right front mug, pair eyes seemed command whole circumference. It impossible drink mug without subjected intense gaze side eyes, Schwartz positively averred once, emptying it, full Rhenish, seventeen times, he seen wink! When came mug's turn made spoons, half broke poor little Gluck's heart; brothers laughed him, tossed mug melting pot, staggered alehouse, leaving him, usual, pour gold bars ready. When gone, Gluck took farewell look his old friend melting pot. The flowing hair gone; nothing remained red nose sparkling eyes, looked malicious ever. "And wonder," thought Gluck, "after treated way." He sauntered disconsolately window sat catch fresh evening air escape hot breath furnace. Now window commanded direct view range mountains which, I told before, overhung Treasure Valley, especially peak fell Golden River. It close day, Gluck sat window, he saw rocks mountain tops, crimson purple sunset; bright tongues fiery cloud burning quivering them; river, brighter all, fell, waving column pure gold, precipice precipice, double arch broad purple rainbow stretched across it, flushing fading alternately wreaths spray. "Ah!" said Gluck aloud, he looked little while, "if river really gold, nice thing would be." "No, would not, Gluck," said clear, metallic voice close his ear. "Bless me, what is that?" exclaimed Gluck, jumping up. There nobody there. He looked round room table great many times behind him, certainly nobody there, he sat window. This time he did not speak, he could not help thinking would convenient river really gold. "Not all, boy," said voice, louder before. "Bless me!" said Gluck again, "what that?" He looked corners cupboards, began turning round round fast he could, middle room, thinking somebody behind him, voice struck his ear. It singing now, merrily, "Lala-lira-la"--no words, soft, running, effervescent melody, something like kettle boil. Gluck looked window; no, certainly house. Upstairs downstairs; no, certainly room, coming quicker time clearer notes every moment: "Lala-lira-la." All struck Gluck sounded louder near furnace. He ran opening looked in. Yes, he saw right; seemed coming furnace pot. He uncovered it, ran back great fright, pot certainly singing! He stood farthest corner room, his hands his mouth open, minute two, singing stopped voice became clear pronunciative. "Hollo!" said voice. Gluck made answer. "Hollo! Gluck, boy," said pot again. Gluck summoned his energies, walked straight crucible, drew furnace, looked in. The gold melted surface smooth polished river, instead reflecting little Gluck's head, he looked he saw, meeting his glance beneath gold, red nose sharp eyes his old friend mug, thousand times redder sharper ever he seen his life. "Come, Gluck, boy," said voice pot again, "I am right; pour out." But Gluck much astonished anything kind. "Pour out, I say," said voice rather gruffly. Still Gluck could not move. "WILL pour out?" said voice passionately. "I am hot." By violent effort Gluck recovered use his limbs, took hold crucible, sloped it, pour gold. But instead liquid stream came out, first pair pretty little yellow legs, coat tails, pair arms stuck akimbo, finally well-known head his friend mug--all articles, uniting rolled out, stood energetically floor shape little golden dwarf foot half high. "That is right!" said dwarf, stretching first his legs his arms, shaking his head far round would go, five minutes without stopping, apparently view ascertaining he quite correctly put together, Gluck stood contemplating speechless amazement. He dressed slashed doublet spun gold, fine texture prismatic colors gleamed surface mother-of-pearl; brilliant doublet his hair beard fell full halfway ground waving curls, exquisitely delicate Gluck could hardly tell ended; seemed melt air. The features face, however, means finished delicacy; rather coarse, slightly inclining coppery complexion, indicative, expression, pertinacious intractable disposition small proprietor. When dwarf finished his self-examination, he turned his small, sharp eyes full Gluck stared deliberately minute two. "No, would not, Gluck, boy," said little man. This certainly rather abrupt unconnected mode commencing conversation. It might indeed supposed refer course Gluck's thoughts, first produced dwarf's observations pot; whatever referred to, Gluck inclination dispute dictum. "Would not it, sir?" said Gluck mildly submissively indeed. "No," said dwarf, conclusively, "no, would not." And dwarf pulled his cap hard his brows took two turns, three feet long, room, lifting his legs high setting hard. This pause gave time Gluck collect his thoughts little, and, seeing great reason view his diminutive visitor dread, feeling his curiosity overcome his amazement, he ventured question peculiar delicacy. "Pray, sir," said Gluck, rather hesitatingly, "were mug?" On little man turned sharp round, walked straight Gluck, drew his full height. "I," said little man, "am King Golden River." Whereupon he turned took two turns, six feet long, order allow time consternation announcement produced his auditor evaporate. After he walked Gluck stood still, expecting comment his communication. Gluck determined say something events. "I hope Majesty well," said Gluck. "Listen!" said little man, deigning reply polite inquiry. "I king mortals call Golden River. The shape saw owing malice stronger king, whose enchantments instant freed me. What I seen conduct wicked brothers renders willing serve you; therefore, attend I tell you. Whoever shall climb top mountain see Golden River issue, shall cast stream source three drops holy water, river shall turn gold. But one failing his first succeed second attempt, anyone shall cast unholy water river, overwhelm he become black stone." So saying, King Golden River turned away deliberately walked center hottest flame furnace. His figure became red, white, transparent, dazzling,--a blaze intense light,--rose, trembled, disappeared. The King Golden River evaporated. "Oh!" cried poor Gluck, running look chimney him, "O dear, dear, dear me! My mug! mug! mug!" CHAPTER III HOW MR. HANS SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE PROSPERED THEREIN The King Golden River hardly made extraordinary exit related last chapter, Hans Schwartz came roaring house savagely drunk. The discovery total loss last piece plate effect sobering enough enable stand Gluck, beating steadily quarter hour; expiration period dropped couple chairs requested know he got say himself. Gluck told his story, which, course, believe word. They beat again, till arms tired, staggered bed. In morning, however, steadiness he adhered his story obtained degree credence; immediate consequence two brothers, wrangling long time knotty question, try his fortune first, drew swords began fighting. The noise fray alarmed neighbors, who, finding could pacify combatants, sent constable. Hans, hearing this, contrived escape, hid himself; Schwartz taken magistrate, fined breaking peace, and, drunk his last penny evening before, thrown prison till he pay. When Hans heard this, he much delighted, determined set immediately Golden River. How get holy water question. He went priest, priest could give holy water abandoned character. So Hans went vespers evening first time his life and, pretense crossing himself, stole cupful returned home triumph. Next morning he got sun rose, put holy water strong flask, two bottles wine meat basket, slung his back, took his alpine staff his hand, set mountains. On his way town he pass prison, he looked windows, he see Schwartz peeping bars looking disconsolate. "Good morning, brother," said Hans; "have message King Golden River?" Schwartz gnashed his teeth rage shook bars his strength, Hans laughed and, advising make comfortable till he came back again, shouldered his basket, shook bottle holy water Schwartz's face till frothed again, marched highest spirits world. It indeed morning might made anyone happy, even Golden River seek for. Level lines dewy mist lay stretched along valley, rose massy mountains, lower cliffs pale gray shadow, hardly distinguishable floating vapor gradually ascending till caught sunlight, ran sharp touches ruddy color along angular crags, pierced, long, level rays, fringes spearlike pine. Far shot red, splintered masses castellated rock, jagged shivered myriads fantastic forms, streak sunlit snow traced chasms like line forked lightning; far beyond far these, fainter morning cloud purer changeless, slept, blue sky, utmost peaks eternal snow. The Golden River, sprang one lower snowless elevations, nearly shadow--all uppermost jets spray, rose like slow smoke undulating line cataract floated away feeble wreaths upon morning wind. On object, alone, Hans's eyes thoughts fixed. Forgetting distance he traverse, he set imprudent rate walking, greatly exhausted he scaled first range green low hills. He was, moreover, surprised, surmounting them, find large glacier, whose existence, notwithstanding his previous knowledge mountains, he absolutely ignorant, lay source Golden River. He entered boldness practiced mountaineer, yet he thought he never traversed strange dangerous glacier his life. The ice excessively slippery, chasms came wild sounds gushing water--not monotonous low, changeful loud, rising occasionally drifting passages wild melody, breaking short, melancholy tones sudden shrieks resembling human voices distress pain. The ice broken thousands confused shapes, none, Hans thought, like ordinary forms splintered ice. There seemed curious EXPRESSION outlines--a perpetual resemblance living features, distorted scornful. Myriads deceitful shadows lurid lights played floated pale blue pinnacles, dazzling confusing sight traveler, his ears grew dull his head giddy constant gush roar concealed waters. These painful circumstances increased upon he advanced; ice crashed yawned fresh chasms his feet, tottering spires nodded around fell thundering across his path; though he repeatedly faced dangers terrific glaciers wildest weather, new oppressive feeling panic terror he leaped last chasm flung himself, exhausted shuddering, firm turf mountain. He compelled abandon his basket food, became perilous incumbrance glacier, means refreshing breaking eating pieces ice. This, however, relieved his thirst; hour's repose recruited his hardy frame, indomitable spirit avarice he resumed his laborious journey. His way lay straight ridge bare red rocks, without blade grass ease foot projecting angle afford inch shade south sun. It past noon rays beat intensely upon steep path, whole atmosphere motionless penetrated heat. Intense thirst soon added bodily fatigue Hans afflicted; glance glance he cast flask water hung his belt. "Three drops enough," last thought he; "I may, least, cool lips it." He opened flask raising his lips, his eye fell object lying rock beside him; he thought moved. It small dog, apparently last agony death thirst. Its tongue out, jaws dry, limbs extended lifelessly, swarm black ants crawling lips throat. Its eye moved bottle Hans held his hand. He raised it, drank, spurned animal his foot, passed on. And he know was, he thought strange shadow suddenly come across blue sky. The path became steeper rugged every moment, high hill air, instead refreshing him, seemed throw his blood fever. The noise hill cataracts sounded like mockery his ears; distant, his thirst increased every moment. Another hour passed, he looked flask his side; half empty, much three drops it. He stopped open it, again, he so, something moved path him. It fair child, stretched nearly lifeless rock, breast heaving thirst, eyes closed, lips parched burning. Hans eyed deliberately, drank, passed on. And dark gray cloud came sun, long, snakelike shadows crept along mountain sides. Hans struggled on. The sun sinking, descent seemed bring coolness; leaden height dead air pressed upon his brow heart, goal near. He saw cataract Golden River springing hillside scarcely five hundred feet him. He paused moment breathe, sprang complete his task. At instant faint cry fell his ear. He turned, saw gray-haired old man extended rocks. His eyes sunk, his features deadly pale gathered expression despair. "Water!" he stretched his arms Hans, cried feebly, "Water! I dying." "I none," replied Hans; "thou hast thy share life." He strode prostrate body darted on. And flash blue lightning rose East, shaped like sword; shook thrice whole heaven left dark one heavy, impenetrable shade. The sun setting; plunged towards horizon like redhot ball. The roar Golden River rose Hans's ear. He stood brink chasm ran. Its waves filled red glory sunset; shook crests like tongues fire, flashes bloody light gleamed along foam. Their sound came mightier mightier his senses; his brain grew giddy prolonged thunder. Shuddering he drew flask his girdle hurled center torrent. As he so, icy chill shot his limbs; he staggered, shrieked, fell. The waters closed his cry, moaning river rose wildly night gushed THE BLACK STONE CHAPTER IV HOW MR. SCHWARTZ SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE PROSPERED THEREIN Poor little Gluck waited anxiously, alone house, Hans's return. Finding he come back, he terribly frightened went told Schwartz prison happened. Then Schwartz much pleased said Hans must certainly turned black stone he gold himself. But Gluck sorry cried night. When he got morning bread house, money; Gluck went hired another goldsmith, he worked hard neatly long every day he soon got money enough together pay his brother's fine, he went gave Schwartz, Schwartz got prison. Then Schwartz quite pleased said he gold river. But Gluck begged he would go see become Hans. Now Schwartz heard Hans stolen holy water, he thought proceeding might considered altogether correct King Golden River, determined manage matters better. So he took Gluck's money went bad priest, gave holy water readily it. Then Schwartz sure quite right. So Schwartz got early morning sun rose, took bread wine basket, put his holy water flask, set mountains. Like his brother he much surprised sight glacier great difficulty crossing it, even leaving his basket behind him. The day cloudless bright; heavy purple haze hanging sky, hills looked lowering gloomy. And Schwartz climbed steep rock path thirst came upon him, upon his brother, he lifted his flask his lips drink. Then he saw fair child lying near rocks, cried moaned water. "Water, indeed," said Schwartz; "I have not half enough myself," passed on. And he went he thought sunbeams grew dim, he saw low bank black cloud rising west; he climbed another hour, thirst overcame he would drunk. Then he saw old man lying path, heard cry water. "Water, indeed," said Schwartz; "I have not half enough myself," he went. Then light seemed fade his eyes, he looked up, and, behold, mist, color blood, come sun; bank black cloud risen high, edges tossing tumbling like waves angry sea cast long shadows flickered Schwartz's path. Then Schwartz climbed another hour, his thirst returned; he lifted his flask his lips he thought he saw his brother Hans lying exhausted path him, he gazed figure stretched arms cried water. "Ha, ha!" laughed Schwartz, "are there? Remember prison bars, boy. Water, indeed! suppose I carried way you?" And he strode figure; yet, he passed, he thought he saw strange expression mockery lips. And he gone yards farther, he looked back; figure there. And sudden horror came Schwartz, he knew why; thirst gold prevailed his fear, he rushed on. And bank black cloud rose zenith, came bursts spiry lightning, waves darkness seemed heave float, flashes, whole heavens. And sky sun setting level like lake blood; strong wind came sky, tearing crimson clouds fragments scattering far darkness. And Schwartz stood brink Golden River, waves black like thunder clouds, foam like fire; roar waters thunder met he cast flask stream. And he lightning glared his eyes, earth gave way beneath him, waters closed his cry. And moaning river rose wildly night gushed TWO BLACK STONES CHAPTER V HOW LITTLE GLUCK SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE PROSPERED THEREIN, WITH OTHER MATTERS OF INTEREST When Gluck found Schwartz come back, he sorry know do. He money obliged go hire goldsmith, worked hard gave little money. So, month two, Gluck grew tired made his mind go try his fortune Golden River. "The little king looked kind," thought he. "I do not think he turn black stone." So he went priest, priest gave holy water soon he asked it. Then Gluck took bread his basket, bottle water, set early mountains. If glacier occasioned great deal fatigue his brothers, twenty times worse him, neither strong practiced mountains. He several bad falls, lost his basket bread, much frightened strange noises ice. He lay long time rest grass, he got over, began climb hill hottest part day. When he climbed hour, he got dreadfully thirsty going drink like his brothers, he saw old man coming path him, looking feeble leaning staff. "Why son," said old man, "I faint thirst; give water." Then Gluck looked him, he saw he pale weary, he gave water. "Only pray do not drink all," said Gluck. But old man drank great deal gave back bottle two thirds empty. Then he bade good speed, Gluck went merrily. And path became easier his feet, two three blades grass appeared upon it, grasshoppers began singing bank beside it, Gluck thought he never heard merry singing. Then he went another hour, thirst increased he thought he forced drink. But he raised flask he saw little child lying panting roadside, cried piteously water. Then Gluck struggled determined bear thirst little longer; he put bottle child's lips, drank drops. Then smiled got ran hill; Gluck looked till became small little star, turned began climbing again. And kinds sweet flowers growing rocks--bright green moss pale pink, starry flowers, soft belled gentians, blue sky deepest, pure white transparent lilies. And crimson purple butterflies darted hither thither, sky sent pure light Gluck never felt happy his life. Yet, he climbed another hour, his thirst became intolerable again; he looked his bottle, he saw five six drops left it, he could venture drink. And he hanging flask his belt again, he saw little dog lying rocks, gasping breath--just Hans seen day his ascent. And Gluck stopped looked it, Golden River, five hundred yards him; he thought dwarf's words, one could succeed except his first attempt; he tried pass dog, whined piteously Gluck stopped again. "Poor beastie," said Gluck, "it will dead I come again, I do not help it." Then he looked closer closer it, eye turned mournfully he could stand it. "Confound king his gold too," said Gluck, he opened flask poured water dog's mouth. The dog sprang stood hind legs. Its tail disappeared; ears became long, longer, silky, golden; nose became red; eyes became twinkling; three seconds dog gone, Gluck stood his old acquaintance, King Golden River. "Thank you," said monarch. "But do not frightened; it is right"--for Gluck showed manifest symptoms consternation unlooked-for reply his last observation. "Why did not come before," continued dwarf, "instead sending rascally brothers yours, trouble turning stones? Very hard stones make, too." "O dear me!" said Gluck, "have really cruel?" "Cruel!" said dwarf; "they poured unholy water stream. Do suppose I am going allow that?" "Why," said Gluck, "I sure, sir,--your Majesty, I mean,--they got water church font." "Very probably," replied dwarf, "but" (and his countenance grew stern he spoke) "the water refused cry weary dying unholy, though blessed every saint heaven; water found vessel mercy holy, though defiled corpses." So saying, dwarf stooped plucked lily grew his feet. On white leaves hung three drops clear dew. And dwarf shook flask Gluck held his hand. "Cast river," he said, "and descend side mountains Treasure Valley. And good speed." As he spoke figure dwarf became indistinct. The playing colors his robe formed prismatic mist dewy light; he stood instant veiled belt broad rainbow. The colors grew faint; mist rose air; monarch evaporated. And Gluck climbed brink Golden River, waves clear crystal brilliant sun. And he cast three drops dew stream, opened fell small, circular whirlpool, waters descended musical noise. Gluck stood watching time, much disappointed, river turned gold, waters seemed much diminished quantity. Yet he obeyed his friend dwarf descended side mountains towards Treasure Valley; he went he thought he heard noise water working way ground. And he came sight Treasure Valley, behold, river, like Golden River, springing new cleft rocks flowing innumerable streams among dry heaps red sand. And Gluck gazed, fresh grass sprang beside new streams, creeping plants grew climbed among moistening soil. Young flowers opened suddenly along riversides, stars leap twilight deepening, thickets myrtle tendrils vine cast lengthening shadows valley grew. And thus Treasure Valley became garden again, inheritance lost cruelty regained love. And Gluck went dwelt valley, poor never driven his door, his barns became full corn his house treasure. And river had, according dwarf's promise, become river gold. And day inhabitants valley point place three drops holy dew cast stream, trace course Golden River ground emerges Treasure Valley. And top cataract Golden River still seen two black stones, round waters howl mournfully every day sunset; stones still called people valley THE BLACK BROTHERS
