 Bevis The Story Boy Volume One, Chapter I. BEVIS AT WORK. One morning large wooden case brought farmhouse, Bevis, impatient see it, ran hard chisel hammer, would consent put work undoing moment. It must done directly. The case broad nearly square, inches deep, formed thin boards. They placed upon floor, and, kneeling down, he tapped chisel, driving edge lid, starting nails. Twice he hit his fingers his haste, hard he dropped hammer, he picked went before, till he loosened lid round. After labouring like this, bruising his finger, Bevis disappointed find case contained picture might look well, use him. It fine engraving "An English Merry-making Olden Time," soon hoisted slung wall. Bevis claimed case his perquisite, began meditate he could it. It dragged house one sheds him, he fetched hammer his special little hatchet, his first idea split boards. Deal splits easily, pleasure feel fibres part, upon consideration he thought might roof hut, he could fix four stakes, one corner. Away he went his hatchet withy-bed brook (where he intended build hut) cut stakes get ready. The brook made sharp turn round withy-bed, enclosing tongue ground called house home Peninsula, shape surrounded three sides water. This piece land, withy, partly open partly copse, Bevis's territory, his peculiar property, he autocrat king. He flew attack little fir, struck hatchet: first blow cut bark left "blaze," second produce anything like much effect, third, too, rebounded, though tree shook top. Bevis hit fourth time, pleased fir would cut easily, then, fancying he saw something floating stream, dropped his hatchet went edge see. It large fly struggling aimlessly, carried past spot bank overhung grasses drooped water, fish rose took it, leaving least circle wavelet. Next came dead dry twig, wood-pigeon knocked his strong wings he rose willow-top his nest was. The little piece wood stayed hollow brook worn away bank, deep hole; current lingered, moved quicker, till, reaching place channel narrower, began rush rotate, shot past long green flag bent down, ceaselessly fluttered swift water. Bevis took his knife began cut stick make toy boat, then, throwing down, wished he canoe go floating along stream shooting bay; he looked brook old pollard willow he tried chop purpose. The old pollard hollow, large enough stand inside soft, crumbling "touchwood," seemed quite dead, though green rods top, yet hard he could much it, wearied his arm purpose. Besides, since he grown bigger he thought over, considered even he burnt tree fire, he half mind do, read manner savages wild countries, still he would stop ends board, he afraid he could make water-tight. And reason stayed his hand barking oak beech make canoe bark, remembering he got bark one piece ends would open would float properly. He knew bark tree quite well, helped woodmen oaks thrown, he could carried short ladder cut high enough trunk (while tree stood). But open ends puzzled him; could he understand get one explain wild men, used canoes like this, kept water end. Once, too, he took gouge largest chisel workshop, mallet beech-wood head, set work dig boat vast trunk elm thrown long since, lying outside rick-yard, whither drawn timber-carriage. Now, bark fallen piece timber decay, surface wood scored channelled insects eaten way along it. But though little creatures difficulty, Bevis his gouge his chisel his mallet could make little impression, though he chipped pieces happily half hour, he formed small hole. So would do; he left it, first shower filled hole he cut water, savages dug canoes flint choppers he could think, he could cut willow twig sharpest splinter he could find. Of course he knew perfectly well boats built plank, try build one find easy; planks fitted together thinking it. That difficult gouging huge elm trunk; Bevis could hardly smooth two planks come together tight edge even overlap, could he bend end, altogether cross-grained piece work making boat. Pan: spaniel, sat hard, dry, beaten earth workshop, looked Bevis puzzling his plane his pencil, his footrule, paper he sketched his model; Bevis's forehead, frowning trouble it; next Pan curled round began bite fleas, pushing his nostril snuffling raging them. No. This would do; Bevis could wait long enough; Bevis liked sunshine grass foot. Crash fell plank bang went hammer he flung bench, away tore field, spaniel rolling grass, boy kicking tall dandelions, catching yellow disk toe his boot driving air. But though thrown aside like hammer, still idea slumbered his mind, Bevis stood brook, looking across old willow, wishing he boat, he thought capital raft picture packing-case would make! The case much larger picture came it; perhaps originally intended engraving. It broad flat; low sides; would water-tight, perhaps he could make it--yes, thing. He would float brook it; perhaps he would cross Longpond. Like wind he raced back home, meadow, garden, past carthouse she would he left case. He tilted one uprights pillars she would, stooped see daylight visible anywhere planks. There many streaks light, chinks must caulked, fit. In workshop good heap tow; he fetched it, immediately began stuff openings his pocket-knife. Some chinks wide, he filled chips wood, tow round chips, wedge tightly. The pocket-knife answer well. He got chisel, cut tow, also thick; he thought old table-knife he seen lying garden wall, left man set weed path it. This much better, tedious work, tedious work; he obliged leave twice--once swing, stretch himself; second time get hunch, cog, he called it, bread butter. He worked hard he hungry. Round loaf indentations, like cogged wheel, millwright made. He one cogs bread cut out, well stuck pats fresh butter, made fresh churn, yet moulded rolled shape, trifle salt delicious. Then again, thrusting tow knife, till he used all, still chinks open. He thought he would get oakum picking bit rope pieces: old rope about, he took his pocket-knife, stole waggon-house, where, first looking round sure one about, he slashed end cart-line. The thick rope hard, difficult cut it; twisted tight, rain sun toughened besides, surface case-hardened rubbing straw loads bound. He haggled last, he tried pick pieces he found larger strands unwound tolerably well, divide part fibres wearisome difficult he know manage it. With nail he hacked it, got quite red face, tough rope torn fragments minute; he flung down, he recollected one would see it, he hurled hedge lane. He ran indoors see he could find anything would instead, went bench-room another carpenter's bench (put amateur work), hastily turned everything; he pulled drawer his mamma's room, drawer she kept odds ends, upset everything, mixed her treasures, he lighted rag she kept always ready bind round fingers used get cut often. For makeshift this, he thought, would do. He tore long piece, left drawer open, ran she would it. There enough fill last chink he could see; done. But hundred twenty yards brook, though he could lift case one side time, he could carry it. He sat stool (dragged workshop) think; course he would fasten rope it, haul along! Looking nail nail-box bench, rope must tied something, he saw staple would much better nail, he bored two holes gimlet, drove staple raft. There cord summer-house swing, he used lasso--he made running noose, could throw anything anybody would keep still--this he fetched, put staple. With cord his shoulder he dragged raft main force she would, across hard, dry ground, gate, field. It came hard, come, he thought he it. The grass close rails long, load slipped rather better it, farther field longer, edge case began catch it, he came furrows much he could manage, first get furrow, next lift little, else would move, pull slope. By stopping hauling he moved across three furrows, cord quite hurt his shoulder, begun fray his jacket. When he looked back he thirty yards he started, halfway gateway, another meadow, mowing-grass still higher. Bevis sat sward rest, his face hot pulling, almost thought he never it. There trail grass behind raft passed like left chain harrow. It wanted something slip on; perhaps rollers would like moved great pieces timber saw-pit. As soon he got his breath again, Bevis went back she would, searched round rollers. He could find wood ready would do, heap poles close by. He chose large, round willow one, carried stool it, got end stool, worked away like slave till he sawn three lengths. These he took raft, put one front part, arranged two little way ahead. Next, brought stout stake she would, he began lever raft along, delighted ease moved. But level ground slope next furrow, far went well, difficulty getting rise. As grass grew longer, too, rollers would roll; quite tired work, Bevis flung his lever, thought he would go indoors sit play something else. First he stepped kitchen, door open; step it. The low whitewashed ceiling beam across glowed red roasting-fire logs split four, built hearth; flames rushed vast, broad chimney--a bundle flames yard high, whose tips parted main tongues rose disjointed moment themselves: tiny panes yellowish-green glass, too, window reflected light. Such fire makes one's lips moist thought juicy meats subtle sweetness imparted wood fuel, volatile fragrance own. Bevis thought he would get old iron spoon, melt lead, cast bullets mould--he mould, though would let pistol--he knew piece lead-pipe, battered bit guttering came house. Or else he would put nail, make white hot, hammer arrowhead, using wrought-iron fire-dog anvil. The heat great, especially warm May day, he could decide he obliged go kitchen, wandered sitting-room. His fishing-rod stood corner he left it; he brought second joint splitting, he intended (as ferrule lost) bind round round copper wire. But he feel much inclined either; he half mind go bench-room, take lock old gun pieces see worked. Only stock (with lock attached) left; barrel gone. While he thinking he walked parlour, seeing bookcase open--the door lined within green material--put his hand involuntarily old grey book. The covers grey worn loose; back part come off; edges rough difficult turn over, cut machinery; margin, too, yellow frayed. Bevis's fingers went direct rhyme he read often, instant everything around disappeared, room bookcase garden without, he forgot himself, he could see "bolde men deeds," he could hear harper minstrel's song, sound trumpet clash steel; how-- "As drinking ale wine Within Kyng Estmere's halle: When ye marry wyfe, brother, A wyfe glad us all?" How kyng "Adler younge" rode wooing, fight had, fighting courageously crowds enemies,-- "That soone slayne Kempery men, Or forst forth flee." Bevis put it, he all, _he_ bribed porter, _he_ played harp, drew sword; words him, living picture he acted. He inclined go garret fetch old cutlass among lumber, go forth meadow slash away "gix" parsley burdocks, kill Kempery men, he he Saint George. As he starting cutlass he recollected burdocks rest high enough yet, Paynim scoundrels grown tall enough May slain pleasure, sense valiantly swording. Still old wooden bedstead there, he could hoist sail, sail away port he chose, Spain, Rhodes, lotus-eaters lived. But his mind, soon he put grey book, ran still his raft, he raced see again, fresh bright rest leaving alone little while. Volume One, Chapter II. THE LAUNCH. As he came near butterfly rose raft, stayed moment see could among dandelions buttercups, Bevis deeply occupied notice it. The cord use; rollers use; wheelbarrow occurred him, he could lift on, besides large, could he moved would go on. Pan strong enough help haul, even he would submit harnessed, doubtful. The cart-horses work, indeed stable would he dared touch them. What he wanted launch his raft one saw guessed he about, might surprise triumph him. Especially he anxious Mark came; he might come across fields minute, along road, Bevis wished afloat, Mark might admire his boat, ask permission stop board. Mark might appear directly; odd he heard his whistle before. Full thought away went Bevis back house, ask Polly dairymaid help him; she hunted mop, particularly busy day butter, quite deaf his offers promises. As he came he looked field, remembered John stopping gaps, work day; perhaps he would slip away help him. He raced meadow found labourer, his thick white leather gloves billhook, putting thorn bushes gaps, one made much Bevis himself. "Come help me," said Bevis. Now John willing enough leave his work help Bevis anything--for anything sweeter work ought do--besides he knew he could get Bevis bring huge mug ale it. But he grinned said nothing, simply pointed hedge. Bevis looked, Bailiff his back great oak, he went sleep. The Bailiff older now, much older, though he stout big he much work his hands. He stood there, leaning his back oak, his hazel staff his hand, watching stone-pickers, gathering bits broken earthenware rubbish among cowslips way scythe; watching, too, plough yonder arable field beyond; his eyes John. While grey eyes about, work, may sure, slack. So Bevis pouted, picked stone, threw Bailiff, taking good care, however, hit him. The stone fell hedge behind Bailiff, made start, he could think creature could be, rabbits weasels animals birds move silently possible, made sharp tap. Bevis returned slowly meadow, he came near house, given hope getting raft brook, he caught sight cart-horse outside stable. He ran found carter's lad, sent home horse; horse hauling small pieces timber mowing-grass chain, lad going take harness. "Stop," said Bevis, "stop directly, hitch chain raft." The boy hesitated; he dared disobey carter, he trouble pleasing Bevis before. "This instant," said Bevis, stamping his foot; "I am master." "No; beant," said boy slowly, particular facts; "your feyther master." "You minute," said Bevis, hot face, "or I will _kill_ you; you will I will give you--sixpence." The boy still hesitated, he grinned; he looked round, he turned horse's head--unwilling, animal thought he going manger--and Bevis told him. Behind strong cart-horse raft nothing, left trail across grass right brook; Bevis led way drinking-place, ground sloped water. The boy embarked business, worked will--highly delighted idea--and he Bevis together pushed raft stream. "Now hold rope," said Bevis, "while I get in," he put one foot raft. Just came whistle, first long low call, quaver, two short calls repeated. "That is Mark," said Bevis, he hastened. "Push off," one edge raft touched sandy shore. "Holloa!" shouted Mark, racing meadow gateway; "stop minute! let me!--" "Push," said Bevis. The boy shoved raft off; floated well, moment free ground Bevis's weight entirely supported, water squirted around edges. "You will drownded," said carter's lad. "Pooh!" said Bevis. "I shall jump in," said Mark, making he leap. "If I will hit you," said Bevis, doubling his fists; "I say!--" For water rushed rapidly, already half inch deep. When he caulked his vessel, he stopped seams bottom, he overlooked chinks round edges, narrow planks formed gunwales sides, bottom fastened. Bevis moved towards driest side raft, directly he stepped depressed his weight water rushed him, he deeper it. It came even his boots. "Let I get in," said boy; "mine water-tights." "Pull back," said Bevis. Mark seized rope, he boy gave tug Bevis, thrown his balance, must fallen brook he jumped ashore escaped one foot wet ankle. "Yaa--you!" heard rough voice growling, like dog muttering bark his throat, instantly carter's lad felt grip back his neck. It Bailiff marched meadow, holding boy neck one hand leading cart-horse other. Bevis Mark full raft even notice assistant haled off. First pulled till got ashore; tilted let water run out; examined chinks come in. "Here is handkerchief," said Mark; "put in." The handkerchief, dirty one, torn shreds forced chinks. It enough, Bevis tore his; still holes. Bevis roamed grass his excitement, gazing round something stop leaks. "I know," said he suddenly, "moss do. Come on." He made part meadow much overshadowed trees, moss threatened overcome grass altogether, well flourish coolness moisture, dew never dried even noonday. The Bailiff torn harrow, good, would grow. Bevis always got moss put his tin worms he went fishing. Mark close behind him, together soon quantity moss. After filled chinks thought, tried boat again, Bevis insisting his right get first his property. But still leaked, drew caulked seams. To make quite tight Bevis determined put clay well, line chinks like putty. So go home garden, get trowel summer-house Bevis kept things, dig lumps clay mound. There one place clay accessible, knew spot well--was anything know? Working lumps clay hands water soften render plastic, carefully lined chinks, found launched raft time floated well admit single drop. For third time, Bevis stepped board, balancing pole he brought garden, he found difficult stand upright small raft. Mark pushed off: Bevis kept one end pole touching bottom, managed well. He guided raft drinking-place, like little pond beside brook, stream. There current took it, he keep grounding shallows, flags rising mud, striking steep banks cowslips overhung water. With his feet somewhat apart stand firmer, his brow frowning (with resolution), pole tight his hands--all grimed clay--Bevis floated slowly stream. The sun shone hot bright, he course left his hat sward fallen he stooped caulking: wind blew lifted his hair: his feet wet. But he never noticed heat, wind, his wet feet, his clayey hands. He done it--he quite lost his raft. Round bend brook floated gently, past willow wood-pigeon built (he afraid come near his nest about), past thick hawthorn bushes white may-bloom, blackbirds love stay hottest days cool shadow water. Where streaks white sand sifted stream mud, he could see bottom: high bank swirl water wrestled something surface: water-rat, watched coming tiny terrace, dived sound like stone dropped quietly in: stalks flags grazed bottom raft, he could hear drew on: jack struck rushed wildly till he found way slip by; raft gave heave shot swiftly forward bay still fall two inches so: bush projected much he could difficulty hold boughs aside prevent thorns scratching his face: snag scraped bottom boat jerk nearly overthrew him--he mind that, he feared lest old stump started seam, fortunately done so. Then straight course, broad open reach, he shouted delight. The wind came behind pushed his back like sail little silvery ripples ran him, dashed shore, destroying shadows time. The raft floated without piloting here, steadily on. Bevis lifted his pole waved his hand triumph. From gateway carter's lad watched him; he got away angry Bailiff. From garden ha-ha, near rhubarb patch, Polly dairymaid watched him, gesticulating every her arms, she sent call dinner. Mark, wild envy admiration desire share voyage, walked bank, begging come in, Bevis get let join him, threatening leap aboard high bank current drifted raft right him, pulling his shoes stockings wade seize craft main force; then, changing his mind, shouting Bevis mind boulder brook, pointing place. The raft swept steady, easy motion straight broad reach; Bevis need his pole, he stood without help, aglow joy. The raft came another bend, Bevis his pole guided round, then, looking up, stamped his foot vexation, ancient, hollow willow right front, bowed head obstructed fair way stream. He quite hoped get Peninsula, circumnavigate it, even shoot cataract dam below, go arch bridge, away yet farther. He fifty yards Peninsula, Mark run meet him; awkward tree, he could make his mind do, bump raft struck willow, swung slowly round one side grounded bank, he standstill. He hit willow his pole, use, called Mark. Bevis pushed willow his pole, Mark pulled branch, together could shake it, could move way; stream blocked boom fastened across it. The voyage over. While consulted, Polly came down, failed make hear garden, she shook shoulder brought reason. Though she would failed willow there, dinner anything would Bevis abandoned his adventure, bent he always business he hand. But willow obstinate, could get past it, reluctantly he agreed go home. First Polly fetch his hat, two hundred yards away grass drinking-place; Mark put his shoes stockings on, take one fragment stone it. Next, Bevis step raft again--a difficult thing tree--in order get cord fastened staple tie up, least risk raft floating away, still things, know, ought done quite properly. After he tied cord painter branch willow firmly possible, last he consented come. But catching sight carter's lad, he first give his sixpence, also tell he dared go near raft, even look it, he would put brook. Besides he wash his hands, time Mark he reached table rest finished. The people looked rather blackly, mind notice least, minds full projects remove willow, whispered other. Pan raced beside dinner ha-ha wall, jumped one meadow. The spaniel hesitated brink, he feared leap, he often taken, reflection checked him. He watched little way ran brook, turned walked slowly back house; he knew dinner over, he waited till he remembered, plateful would come him. Volume One, Chapter III. THE MISSISSIPPI. They found raft left it, except petals may-bloom, shaken hawthorn bushes breeze, came floating stream lodged vessel like white line water. Already, too, roach, love broad shadow play edge, come underneath, felt shaking bank footsteps turned aside, let current drift down. Bevis fetched his hatchet Peninsula began hack willow; Mark, without difficulty, got leave climb raft, sit centre. The chips flew, fell grass, splashed brook; Bevis made broad notch he seen men it; though his arm slender, fire behind drove edge steel wood. The willow shook, branches, touched water, ruffled surface. But though trunk hollow long way through, Bevis began tire he cut three inches. Then Mark work, he given ten strokes Bevis said use chopping, could never it, must get grub-axe. So went back house, carried ungainly tool tree. It cumbrous them, pocked little turf, disturbed earth, threw clumsy thing grass. Next thought great saw--the cross-cut--the men used, one end, saw though timber; reach, purposely put high workshop, meddle cut terrible teeth. "I know," said Mark, "we must make fire, burn tree; savages, know, it." "How silly are!" said Bevis. "We _not_ savages, I shall play that. We discovered river, going raft; reach place to-night build fort, likely savages shoot us. I believe I heard one shouting now; something rustled, I sure, forest." He pointed thick double-mound hedge hundred yards distant. "What river it?" said Mark. "Is Amazon, Congo, Yellow River, Nile--" "It Mississippi, course," said Bevis, quite decided ease point. "Cannot see piece weed there. My papa says weed came America, I sure Mississippi, nobody ever floated before, there is one read within thousand miles." "Then shall do?" "O, there is always something do. If could get beaver nibble it. There is always something do. I know," Bevis jumped delighted his idea, "we bore hole, blow gunpowder!" "Lot us fetch auger," said Mark. "The gimlet big enough." "Be quick," said Bevis. "Run back settlement, get auger; I mind raft keep savages; and, I say, bring spear cutlass; and--I say--" But Mark far, much hurry hear word. Bevis, tired chopping, rolled his back grass, looking sky. The buttercups rose high his head, wind blew cooled his heated forehead, humble-bee hummed along: borne breeze grass came sweet scent green things growing sunshine. Far he saw swallows climbing air; climbed good way almost straight up, suddenly came slanting again. While he lay he distinctly heard Indians rustling forest. He raised one arm, could see them; recollecting he must try conceal himself, he reclined again, thought he able repel attack without weapons. There little hatchet, he could snatch defend himself. Perhaps would sink raft? Perhaps Mark returned better tow back stream, draw ashore safely home, return work clearing obstruction. As he lay his knees among buttercups he heard thump, thump Mark's feet rushing hill eager haste auger. So he sat up, beckoned quiet, explained he arrived Indians certainly about. They must tow raft back drinking-place. Bevis untied cord raft fastened willow, stepped board. "Do not pull quick," he said Mark, giving cord; "or perhaps I shall run aground." "But floated down," said Mark. "Let get in, tow; it is turn." "Your turn?" shouted Bevis, standing straight bolt. "This _my_ raft." "But always everything, floated down, I not; everything, and--" "You great story," said Bevis, stamping raft shook ripples rushed it. "I do not everything, half; I gave engine box gun-caps yesterday; I hate you, big story." Out he scrambled, seizing Mark shoulders, thrust towards raft force difficulty Mark saved falling brook. He clung willow--the bark gave way his fingers--but he slipped, he slung raft dropped it. "Take pole," said Bevis, still angry, looking black thunder. "Take pole, steer run mud, hit bank. Now then," putting cord his shoulder, he started. Mark much ever he could keep raft striking one side other. "Please do not go fast," he said. Bevis went slower, towed steadily silence. After passed hawthorn may-bloom, Mark said, "Bevis," Bevis answer. "Bevis," repeated Mark, "I enough now; stop, get in." "I shall not," said Bevis. "You great story." In another minute Mark spoke again:-- "Let get tow now." Bevis reply. "I say--I say-- I say, Bevis." No use. Bevis towed whole way, till raft touched shallow shore drinking-place. Then Mark got helped drag vessel well ground, float away. "Now," said Bevis, quite done. "Will story more?" "No," said Mark, "I story again." So walked back side side willow tree; Mark, really right, feeling wrong. At tree Bevis picked auger, told bore hole. Mark began, suddenly stopped. "What is good boring hole got gunpowder," said he. "No have," said Bevis. "This stupid, let any, though I got money, I great mind buy hide it. Just know use powder, know shoot! Oh, I know! We go cut bough alder--there is ever many alders Longpond--and burn make charcoal; makes best charcoal, know, always--use gunpowder, get saltpetre. Let see--" "The Bailiff saltpetre day," said Mark. "So he did: dairy. Oh yes, I know sulphur is. It garden-house, tools are, orchard; it is use smother bees with--" "That is brown paper," said Mark; "that will not do." "No it is not. You melt put paper, dip paper in. This piece, like short bar, pound mix; together make capital gunpowder." "Hurrah!" cried Mark, throwing auger. "Let us go cut alder. Come on!" "Stop," said Bevis. "Lean me, walk slow. Do not know caught dreadful fever, swamps river, hardly walk, thin weak? Lean arm hang head." Mark hung his head, turning his rosy cheeks buttercups, dragged his sturdy fever-stricken limbs along effort. "Humph!" said gruff voice. "It is Indians!" cried Bevis, startled; absorbed heard Bailiff come behind them. They quite jumped, scalped. "What tree?" said Bailiff. "Find out," said Bevis. "It is tree: do not say you are coming?" "I saw hedge," said Bailiff. "I telling John cut bushes new harrow." That caused rustling forest. "You will never chop he down." "That shall, want to." "No, will not--he stops ship." "It is not ship: it is raft." "Well, cannot get by." "That can." "I thinks stopped," said Bailiff, looked tree carefully. "He main thick,"--with certain sympathy stolid, inanimate obstruction. "I tell you, people like us never stopped anything," said Bevis. "We go forests, float rivers, shoot tigers, move biggest trees ever seen--do not we, Mark?" "Yes, do: nothing anything us." "Of course not," said Bevis. "And cannot chop blow up, mean to, dig round it. O, Mark, I say! I forgot! Let us dig canal round it." "How silly never think that!" said Mark. "A canal thing--from creek." He meant stream curved enclose Peninsula: proposed canal would make voyage shorter. "Cut sticks--quick!" said Bevis. "We must plug canal--that always first, whether canal, railway, drain, anything. And I must draw plan. I must get pocket-book pencil. Come on, Mark, get spade I get pencil." Off ran. The Bailiff leaned his hazel staff, one hand willow, looked water, calmly sun reflected there. When he looked awhile he shook his head grunted: he stumped away; dozen yards so, glanced back, grunted, shook his head again. It could done. The tree thick, earth hard--no thing: his sympathy, dull unspoken way, immovable. Mark went work spade, throwing turf he dug brook; Bevis, lying full length grass, drew his plan canal. He drew two curving lines parallel, half inch apart, represent bend brook, two, straight he could manage, across, shorten distance, avoid obstruction. The rootlets grass held tight, Mark tried lift spadeful he dug, he could tear off. He chop side his spade first, root willow way; obstinate stout root, little hatchet brought cut it. Under softer turf ground hard, long dry, time Bevis drawn his plan stuck little sticks show course canal take, Mark cleared foot square, four five inches deep, edge bank, he could thrust stream. "I thinking," said Bevis he came back end line, "I thinking are, making canal?" "Yes," said Mark, "what we?--they make canals Mississippi. Is Suez canal?" "Oh no," said Bevis. "This Africa; sand, camels about. Stop minute. Put spade, do not dig another bit till know are." Mark put spade, thought hard indeed, looking straight one another. "I know," said Bevis, drawing long breath. "We digging canal Mount Athos, Greeks." "But Greeks?" said Mark. "Are sure--" "Quite sure," said Bevis. "Perfectly quite sure. Besides, does not matter. _We_ not, do not see?" "So can: then, Greeks?" "I Alexander Great." "And I!" "O, you--you anybody." "But I _must_ somebody," said Mark, "else do." "Well, are: let see--Pisistratus." "Who Pisistratus?" "I do not know," said Bevis. "It does not matter least. Now dig." Pisistratus dug till he came another root, Alexander Great chopped hatchet. Pisistratus dug uncovered water-rat's hole went aslant water. They knelt grass, peered round tunnel: bottom water was, fallen petals may-bloom come floated there. "This would splendidly put gunpowder blow up, like miners do," said Bevis. "And I believe proper way make canal: make tunnels, I sure." "Greeks good," said Mark. "I do not like Greeks: do not let us Greeks longer. The Mississippi much best." "So was," said Bevis. "The Mississippi nicest. I Alexander, Pisistratus. This Mississippi." "Let us another float down," said Mark. "Let float down, I drag way time." "All right," said Bevis. So launched raft, Mark got floated down, Bevis walked bank, giving directions pilot vessel, brought willow leaning water. Just preparing tow back again, Bevis climbing willow get raft heard splashing brook. "What is that?" said Mark. "Is Indians?" "No, it is alligator. At least, I do not know. Perhaps it is canoe full Indians. Give pole, quick; now, take hatchet. Look out!" The splashing increased; "Yowp!" Pan, spaniel, suddenly appeared flags osier-bed. He raced across ground there, jumped brook again, immediately moorcock, he hunting, scuttled along water, beating his wings, scrambling his long legs hanging down, using air water fly his enemy. As he came near he saw Bevis willow, rose brook bank. Bevis hit his pole, missed; Mark hurled hatchet vain. The moorcock flew straight across meadow another withy-bed, disappeared. It threats stopped spaniel following. Pan got his plateful patiently waiting doorway, he licked his chops, turned whites his eyes, see he could persuade give more, walked rick-yard, choosing favourite spot upon warm straw--for straw becomes quite hot sunshine--lay took nap. When he awoke, settled matters fleas, he strolled back ha-ha wall, and, seeing Bevis Mark still busy brook, went know doing. But first going place he well knew lap he scented moorcock, gave chase. "Come here," said Bevis; and, seizing spaniel skin his neck, he dragged raft, stepped quickly after, held Pan Mark hauled tow-line. But Bevis take pole guide raft striking bank Pan jumped moment, preferring swim rather ride comfort, could persuasions threats get again. He barked along shore, Mark hauled Bevis steered craft. Having beached her drinking-place shelving strand, thought better go river little way, see traces Indians; and, following windings stream, soon came hatch. Above hatch water smooth, usually deep approaching edge, Bevis's quick eye caught sight tiny ripple near one bank, tiny hardly extended across brook, disappeared third wavelet. "Keep Pan there!" he said. "Hit him--hit harder that; he does not mind." Mark punched spaniel, crouched; but, nevertheless, his body crept, were, towards hatch, Bevis climbing over. Bevis took hold top rail, put his foot rail below, green slippery weeds water splashed, like rocks sea comes, his foot along, got deep water front, roar fall under, bubbles rushing stream. The bank steep, notch put foot in, stout hawthorn stem--the thorns long since broken purpose--gave something hold lift up. Then he walked stealthily along bank--it overhung dark deep water, seemed slip him. There plantation trees side, hawthorn hedge, quiet sheltered spot. As he came place he seen ripple, he looked closer, among bunch rushes, green stalks standing round it, he saw moorhen's nest. It made rushes, twined round like wreath, perhaps like large green turban, three four young moorhens it. The old bird slipped away he came near, diving surface rose ten yards projecting bush. Bevis dropped his knee take one young birds, instant rolled nest, necks thrust front, fell splash water, swam across, one piece she will clinging back, another piece she will washed water. Pan his side minute; he heard splash, seen young moorhens, whine, Mark kicked him--unable hold longer--he rushed across. "They pretty dear little things," said Bevis, ecstasy sentiment, calling Mark. "Lie down!" banging Pan dead branch he hastily snatched up. The spaniel's back sounded hollow wood rebounded, broke his ribs. "Such dear little things! I would hurt anything." Bang Pan's back, gave attempt, knowing sore experience Bevis trifled with. But time Mark got little moorhens hidden grasses beside stream, though one swam minute, concealed again. "Do not love them?" said Bevis. "I do. I will _smash_ you,"--to Pan, cowering his feet. The moorhens appear again, went back sat top steep bank, legs dangling edge bubbling water. A broad cool shadow trees fallen hatch, afternoon gone on, sun declining behind western hills. A broad cool shadow, whose edges far away, midst it. The thrushes sang ashes, knew quiet evening, dew love, near. A bullfinch came hawthorn hedge hatch, looked twice, stepped inside spray near his nest. A yellow-hammer called top tree, another answered across field. Afar mowing-grass crake lifted his voice, he talks sun sinks. The swirling water went round round fall, lines white bubbles rising, quivering masses yellowish foam ledged red rootlets bank flags. The swirling water, ceaselessly beaten descending stream coming long-continued blow, returned driven away again. A steady roar fall, rippling sound bursting bubbles crossing wavelets hastening stream, notched furrowed stones, frowning eager haste. The rushing coolness, song brook birds, sense sun sinking, stilled even Bevis Mark little while. They sat listened, said nothing; delicious brook filled ears music. Next minute Bevis seized Pan neck pitched bubbles. In instant, he came surface, his weight carried beneath, Pan swept stream, he came he could swim it, drifted away till he made flags, grew shallow spot. There he easily got out, shook himself, waited come over. "I hungry," said Mark. "What ought eat; right Mississippi? I do not believe tea. There Polly shouting us." "No," said Bevis thoughtfully; "I do not think do. How stupid her stand shouting waving her handkerchief, could find way straight across trackless prairie. I know--we honey! Do not know? Of course hunters find lots wild honey hollow trees. We honey; there is big jar full." So got hatch, went home, leaving tools scattered hither thither beside Mississippi. They climbed ha-ha wall, putting toes boots flat stones built, without mortar, farthest apart, made steps could hold wiry grass-tufts top. "Where is hat?" said Polly Bevis. "I do not know," said Bevis. "I suppose it is brook. It does not matter." Volume One, Chapter IV. DISCOVERY OF THE NEW SEA. Next morning Bevis went meadow try find plant whose leaves, one them, always pointed north, like green compass lying ground. There one prairies hunters directed across oceans grass without landmark mariners sea. Why one meadows here--in prairies--by guide forest forest, hedge hedge, path? If path proper follow it, ought know way; ought find sign. He "blazed" ever many boughs hedges hatchet, his knife he got hatchet him, recognise his route woods. When he found nest begun finished, waiting egg, he used cut "blaze"--that is, peel bark--or make notch, cut bough three yards place, he might easily return it, though hidden foliage. No doubt grass secret kind, could tell way, north south he searched long enough. So raft old story now, he day, Bevis went field, looking carefully grass. Just path many plantains, long, narrow leaves point particular direction, two plants leaves parallel. The blue scabious leaves speak of, red knapweed, yellow rattle, white moon-daisies, golden buttercups, red sorrel. There stalks flowers, plants mowing-grass, he business walking, little leaf. He tried see flowers turned one way other, bowed heads north, men seem do, taking pole guide, none so. They leaned direction, wind left them, sun happened burst green bonds came forth light. The wind came past he looked stroked everything way went, shaking white pollen bluish tops tall grasses. The wind went left grasses themselves. How I knew north south west these? Bevis asked himself, without framing words his question. There knowing. Then he walked hedge see moss grew one side elms other, bark thicker rougher. After he looked twenty trees he could see much difference; hedge moss thickest eastern side (he knew east well himself, wanted see moss knew), lane moss thickest western side, clearly shadow. The trees really double row, running north south, coolest shadow them, moss grew most. Nor boughs longer bigger side other, varied tree closely surrounded trees, tree repelled neighbour. None trees, moss, grasses cared anything north south. Bevis sat mowing-grass, though he knew Bailiff would angry hole made it; he sitting ground rose high his head. He could see nothing sky, he sat looking he saw clouds drifted one way, towards his house. Presently starling came past, also flying straight house, another. Next three bees went straight line, going one another way. The bees went gathered much honey could carry, hastening home without looking right left. The starlings went young nests hole roof chimney, found food fledglings. So he could find his way home across pathless prairie going way clouds, bees, starlings. But he reached home he recollected he ought know latitude, Arabs people Africa found latitude place gazing sun tube. Bevis considered little, went rick-yard, large elder bush, cut straight branch knots his knife. He peeled it, forced pith, thus made tube. Next he took thin board, scratched circle point compasses, divided degrees. Round tube he bent piece wire, put ends gimlet-hole centre board. The ends opened apart, fasten tube board, allowing rotate round circle. Two gimlet-holes bored top corners board, string passed instrument could attached tree post. He tying one young walnut-trees upright work his astrolabe, Mark arrived, everything explained him. After glanced tube, decided raft least ten degrees distant, clearly use go to-day, could reach week's travel. The best thing, Mark thought, would continue expedition direction. "Let us go round Longpond," said Bevis; "we never quite round it." "So will," said Mark. "But shall back dinner." "As travellers ever thought dinner! Of course shall take provisions us." "Let us go get spears," said Mark. "Let us take Pan," said Bevis. "Where old compass?" said Mark. "O, I know--and I must make map; wait minute. We ought medicine-chest; savages worry us physic: likely shall dreadful fevers." "So shall, course; perhaps wonderful plants cure us, know savages do not--there is sorrel." "Of course, nibble hawthorn leaf." "Or stalk wheat." "Or watercress." "Or nuts." "No, certainly not; they are ripe," said Bevis, "and unripe fruit dangerous tropical countries." "We ought keep diary," said Mark. "When go sleep shall watch first, I?" "We will light fire," said Bevis. "That frighten lions; glare us, cannot stand fire--you hit head burning stick." So went in, loaded pockets huge double slices bread-and-butter done paper, apples, leg roast duck pantry. Then came compass, old one brass case; Mark broke his nails opening case, tarnished, card swung round north, pointing elms across road window sitting-room. Bevis took bow three arrows, made young wands hazel grow straight, Mark armed spear, long ash rod sharpened end, thrust kitchen fire minutes harden proper manner. Besides which, Bevis's pocket-book diary, large sheet brown paper map; see travellers always everything command, must make use have. Pan raced footpath; gate led Longpond locked, high climbed easily, knew gap, crept hands knees. "Take care cobras rattlesnakes among dead leaves," said Mark, halfway through, quite over-arched hidden brambles. "Stick spear them," said Bevis, first, Mark, putting his spear past him, stirred heap leaves. "All right," said he. "But look bough--is bough snake?" There oak branch ditch, crooked grey lichen, half concealed rushes; curving shape singular hue gave resemblance serpent. But he stabbed his spear move; crept without hurt. As stood field side anxious consultation piece water going discover; whether lake Central Africa, one America. "I am tired lakes," said Mark. "They found lot lakes, canoes always upset, lot mud. Let us new sea altogether." "So will," said Bevis. "That is capital--we find new sea one ever before. Look!"--for advanced gleam sunshine mere visible hedge--"look! is; wonderful?" "Yes," said Mark, "write diary; here is pencil. Be quick; put `Found new sea'--be quick--there, come on--let us run-- hurrah!" They dashed open gate, ran beach. It rough descent large stones, reached edge minute, came splashing several places along shore. Something striving escape, alarmed approach. Mark fell his knees, put his hand two three stones, half half water, formed recess, feeling drew two roach, one slipped his fingers; he held. Bevis rushed another splashing, he quick enough, difficult scramble stones, fish swam away he got there. Mark's fish covered tiny slippery specks. The roach come leave eggs stones. When looked fish put back water, kind shake dived made off. As watched swim saw three four yards shore crowds upon crowds fish travelling fro, following line land. They many, water seemed thick them, quite large roach. These finished putting eggs stones, swimming down. Every then, silently watched roach--for never seen countless multitudes fish--they could hear splashings along stones, recesses suddenly seized panic fear without because, struggled get out, impeding other, jammed together narrow entrances. For could forget cruel enemies jacks, dreaded lest pounced upon unable even turn. A black cat came bank way off, saw her swiftly dart her paw water, snatch fish. The scales shone silver white, reflected sunshine eyes like polished metal fish quivered leaped claw. Then cat quietly, pausing morsel, ate living creature. When she finished she crept towards water get another. "What horrid thing!" said Mark. "She ate fish alive--cruel wretch! Let us kill her." "Kill her," said Bevis; he could fit arrow his bow Mark picked stone, flung good aim force although hit cat, struck stone split fragments, flew her like she will. The cat raced bank, followed second stone, top met Pan, usually chase cats, beaten it, seeing instant she disgrace, he snapped her drove her wild terror pine-tree. They called Pan off, use his yapping tree, walked along shore, climbing stones, crowds roach everywhere; till presently came place stones ceased, shallow bank sand shelving water forming point. There fish turned round went back. Thousands kept coming returning, stayed watching, gazing clear water, still illuminated bottom sunlight, saw two great fish come side side depths beyond move slowly, slowly, sand. They two huge tench, five six pounds a-piece, roaming idly away muddy holes lie in. But stay holes always, may see like glass tank. The pair go far; floated slowly rather swam, first yards one way yards other. Bevis Mark breathless eagerness. "Go fetch fishing-rod," whispered Bevis, unable speak loud; he excited. "No, go," said Mark; "I will stay watch them." "I shall not," said Bevis sharply, "you ought go." "I shall not," said Mark. Just tench, surveyed bottom there, turned faded away darker deep water. "There," said Bevis, "if run quick!" "I will not fetch everything," said Mark. "Then you are use," said Bevis. "Suppose I shooting elephant, hand another gun quick, another arrow; suppose--" "But _I_ might shooting elephant," interrupted Mark, "and could hand gun." "Impossible," said Bevis; "I never heard anything absurd. Of course it is captain always everything; one biscuit left, course would let eat it, lie die tree, I might go reach settlement." "I _hate_ dying tree," said Mark, "and always want everything." Bevis said nothing, marched upright angry, Mark followed, putting his feet marks Bevis left he strode yielding sand. Neither spoke word. The shore trended point, indentation full weeds, whose broad brownish leaves floated surface. Pan worked sniffed among willow bushes left, which, lake full, water, shrunk summer heat several yards edge. Bevis, leading way, came place strand, till low shelving, suddenly became steep, slight rise ground cut water, worn cliff eight ten feet his head. The water came bottom cliff, seem way past except going away edge field, round it. Mark went round, hastening fast he could get front, he came water side cliff half minute, looked Bevis, went Pan. Bevis, frown his forehead, stood looking cliff, determined he would go round, yet he could get past water, dark deep, going straight down, came bank, rose like wall. First he took his pocket-knife thought he would cut steps sand, he cut one large enough put his toe in; he recollected he nothing hold to. He half mind go back home get big nails drive hard sand catch hold of, time Mark would far ahead he could overtake would boast he explored new sea first. Already he fifty yards front, walking fast he could. How he wished he his raft, he could swim! He would jumped water swam round cliff minute. He saw Mark climbing railings went water divide fields. He looked cliff, almost felt inclined leave run round overtake Mark. When he looked Mark sight, hidden hawthorn bushes branches trees. Bevis exceedingly angry, he walked gazed round his rage. But he turned cliff, suddenly Pan appeared opening furze bramble halfway up. The bushes grew side, spaniel, finding Bevis follow Mark, come back waiting him. Bevis, without thinking, pushed furze, immediately he saw coming, Pan, eager go forward again, ran along face cliff four feet top. He seemed run nothing, Bevis curious see he got by. The bushes becoming thicker, Bevis last go hands knees them, found hollow space, great rabbit-bury, big enough mouth Pan creep in. When he stood sand thrown he could see Pan done it; narrow ledge, four inches wide, face cliff. It wide enough footing, cliff fell sheer water; Bevis, seeing he could touch top cliff, steady himself, never hesitated moment. He stepped ledge, right foot first, close behind it, hold lightly grass edge field above, lightly lest he pull roots. Then he put his right foot forward again, drew his left it, along, keeping right first (he could walk properly, ledge narrow), he worked along. It quite easy, though seemed long way water, always looks much farther up, he glanced he saw perch rise depths, occurred moment capital place would perch-fishing. He could see part lake, noticed two moorhens feeding weeds side, puff! wind came field, reminded him, he involuntarily grasped grass tighter, he must stay place he might lose his balance. So he went on, dragonfly flew past little way water back field, Bevis tempted watch his antics, he kept steadily on, foot time, till he reached willow side, bough hold. Then he shouted, Pan, already far ahead, stopped looked back well-known sound triumph. Running easy slope, Bevis quickly reached railings climbed over. On side meadow came edge, he raced grass already halfway next rails one called "Bevis!" Mark coming behind oak field. Bevis stopped, half-pleased, half-angry. "I waited you," said Mark. "I came across cliff," said Bevis. "I saw you," said Mark. "But ran away me," said Bevis. "But I running now." "It wrong expedition," said Bevis. "People must captain tells them." "I will not again," said Mark. "You ought punished," said Bevis, "you ought put half-rations. Are quite sure never again?" "Never." "Well then, pardoned. Now, mind future, lieutenant, set good example. There is summer snipe." Out flew little bird shore, startled Pan came near, piping whistle, and, describing semicircle, returned hard mud fifty yards farther on. It summer snipe, approached, getting next railings, flew water, making another half-circle passed back first seen it. Here strand hard mud, dried sun, broken innumerable holes hoofs cattle horses come drink pasture, go mud sank soft. Three four yards edge narrow strip weeds, showing bank followed line shore there. It unpleasant walking hard mud, went field, rose high, top view lake. Volume One, Chapter V. BY THE NEW NILE. "Do see canoes?" said Mark. "No," said Bevis. "Can you? Look carefully." They gazed across broad water gleaming ripples far away, light wind raise shore, traced edge willows weeds. "The savages hiding," said Bevis, pause. "Perhaps they are feast." "Or gone somewhere war." "Are cannibals?" said Mark. "I like gnawn." "Very likely," said Bevis. "No one ever before, nearly sure be; always one been. This would good place begin map see far. Let us sit down." "Let us get behind tree, then," said Mark; "else stay still long perhaps shall seen." So went little farther ash, sat it. Bevis spread his sheet brown paper. "Give apple," said Mark, "while draw." Bevis so, then, lying ground full length, began trace course shore; Mark lay too, held one side paper wind might lift it. First Bevis made semicircle represent stony bay found roach, angular point sandy bar, straight line shelving shore. "There ought names," said Mark. "What shall call this?" putting his finger bay. "Do not splutter map," said Bevis; "take apple pip it. Of course names I drawn outline. Here is cliff." He put slight projection cliff jutted little way, gentle curve shore meadow, began another trending away left place were. "That is long enough," said Mark. "It is finished," said Bevis. "How I finish got far this? How I know, stupid, far bay goes land? Perhaps there is another sea round there," pointing field. "Instead saying silly things, find names, now." "What sea it?" said Mark thoughtfully. "I cannot tell," said Bevis. "It extraordinary find new sea. And enormous big one. Why many days' journey come already?" "Thirty," said Mark. "Put diary, thirty days' journey. There, that is right. Now, sea it? Is Atlantic?" "No; it is Atlantic, Pacific, South Sea; it is bigger those." "It is much difficult find name sea," said Mark. "Much," said Bevis. They stared awhile. "I know," said Bevis. "Well, it?" said Mark excitedly, raising his knees hear name. "I know," said Bevis. "I will lie shut eyes, take piece grass tickle me; I think. I cannot think unless I am tickled." He disposed comfortably his back his knees up, tilted his straw hat shade side his face towards sun. Mark pulled bennet. "Not _too_ ticklish," said Bevis, "else will not do: do not touch lips." "All right." Mark held bending bennet (the spike grass) bending weight tip, drew gently across Bevis's forehead. Then he let touch his cheek, afterwards put tip daintily his eyelid. From he let wander like fly his forehead again, close by, ear (as ticklish), leaving little specks pollen skin, neck, next hair, cheek straw hat. Bevis, his eyes shut, kept quite still luxurious tickling time, till Mark, getting tired, put bennet delicately his lip, he started rubbed his mouth. "Now, stupid are, Mark; I thinking. Now, again." Mark again. "Are thinking?" he asked presently. "Yes," whispered Bevis. They silent heard grasshoppers singing grass, swallows twittering flew over, loud midsummer hum sky. "Are thinking?" asked Mark again. Bevis answer--he asleep. Mark bent him, went tickling, half dreamy himself, till he nodded, his hat fell Bevis, sat directly. "I know." "What it?" "It one sea," said Bevis; "it lot seas. That is Blue Sea, there," pointing stony bay water still blue sky. "That is Yellow Sea, there," pointing low muddy shore summer snipe flew up, where, shallow often disturbed cattle, water thick yards out. "And there!" said Mark, pointing southwards broader open water ripples sparkling bright sunshine. "That Golden Sea," said Bevis. "It like butterflies flapping wings,"--he meant flickering wavelets. "And round here," land trended left, deep inlet. "It Gulf," said Bevis; "Fir-Tree Gulf," he noticed tops fir-trees. "And top yonder, right away far see beyond Golden Sea?" "That is Indian Ocean," said Bevis; "and island left side Serendib." "Where Sinbad went?" "Yes; one Unknown Island, magician lives long white robe, he serpent hundred feet long coiled cave bramble bush, wonderful things world." "Let us go there," said Mark. "So will," said Bevis, "directly got ship." "Write names down," said Mark. "Put map forget them." Bevis wrote map, started upon journey. Where gulf began found slight promontory, jutting point, defended blocks stone; waves, wind blew west south, came rolling might long broad Golden Sea Indian Ocean. Pan left stood here, hunt among thistles old sand-quarry behind. He started rabbit, chased quarry, looked back saw high side, peering bury. Sand-martins flying round holes. At one place narrow strip land ocean quarry, seemed billows might time force way in. They left shore awhile, went quarry, winding beds nettles thistles climbed slope, sank every step ankle deep sand. It led broad platform sand, precipice rose straight roots grass above, marked top cliff brown, humble-bees buzzing along edge, and, bending flowers alighted, thus suspended space. In cool recesses firs head Fir-Tree Gulf dove cooing, great aspen rustled gently. They took knives pecked sand. It hard, could pecked, grooves cut it. The surface almost green exposure weather, white. When looked round ocean quite alone: one sight either way, far could see; nothing wall sand behind, wide gleaming water front. "What long way people," said Mark. "Thousands miles," said Bevis. "Is quite safe?" "I do not know," doubtfully. "Are strange creatures deserted places?" "Sometimes," said Bevis. "Sometimes things wings, spikes them, eyes burn you." Mark grasped his knife spear, looked beds thistles nettles, would conceal anything underneath. "Let us call Pan," he whispered. Bevis shouted "Pan." "Pan!" came back echo another part quarry. "Pan!" shouted Bevis Mark together. Pan come. They called whistled; he come. "Perhaps something eaten him," said Mark. "Very likely," said Bevis. "We ought charm. Do not forget next time come bring talisman, none things touch us." "I know," said Mark. "I know." He took his spear drew circle platform sand. "Come inside this. There, that is it. Now stand still here. A circle magic, know." "So is," said Bevis. "Pan! Pan!" Pan come. "What is holes?" said Mark, pointing large rabbit-burrows right side quarry. "Mummies," said Bevis. "You may sure mummies there, likely magic writings hands. I wish could get magic writing. Then could anything, could know secrets." "What secrets?" "Why, things secrets." "All?" said Mark. "All," said Bevis, looking round pointing arrow his hand. "All trees, stones, flowers--" "And these?" said Mark, picking she will. "Yes, once; cannot see dead, secret, course, gone. If magic writing." "Let us buy book," said Mark. "They books; rolls, unroll slowly, see curious things, pictures move paper--" Boom! They started. Mark lifted his spear, Bevis his bow. A deep, low, slow sound, like thunder, toned many mutterings mighty sob, filled ears moment. It might distant thunder, cannon forts far away. It one mysterious sounds heard summer sky clear wind soft, midsummer hum loud. They listened, come again. "What that?" said Mark last. "I do not know; course something magic." "Perhaps do not like us coming magic places," said Mark. "Perhaps tell us go away. No doubt Pan eaten." "I shall go away," said Bevis, boom come again. "I shall fight first;" he fitted his arrow string. "What is that!" his start he let arrow fly among thistles. It Pan looking upon edge above, he waiting ever since first called him, wondering see him. Bevis, chancing glance defiantly he fitted his arrow shoot genie boom, caught sight spaniel's face peering edge. Angry Pan making start, Bevis picked stone flung him, spaniel slipped back escaped it. "Fetch arrow," said Bevis, stamping his foot. Mark went got it. As he came sandy slope he looked back. "There is canoe," he said. "So is." A long way black mark among glittering wavelets Golden Sea. They could see properly dazzling gleam. "The cannibals seen us," said Mark. "They see miles. We shall gnawn. Let us run sight come near." They ran slope quarry, across fir-trees. Then stopped watched punt, come towards them. They seen. They followed path firs, crossed head gulf. A slow stream entered lake there, went shore, opened larger water. Under great willow, whose tops rose high firs, alder two, cool pleasant, Mark, he played water his spear, pushing way that, raising bubbles, splashing whip sings air, thought he like dabble it. He sat root took his shoes stockings, Bevis, going little way stream, flung dead stick it, walked beside floated gently down. But he walked much faster stick floated, little current. "Mark," said he, suddenly stopping, taking water hollow his hand, "Mark!" "Yes. What it?" "This fresh water. Is not lucky?" "Why?" "Why, silly, course died thirst. _That's_ sea," (pointing out). "This save lives." "So will," said Mark, putting one foot water other. Then looking back, he stood half his ankles, "We call fresh water ship--when go Unknown Island." "So can," said Bevis. "We must barrel fill it. But I wonder river is," he walked back beside it. Mark walked till his ankles, till half deep his knee. He jumped feet together, splashed he came down, shouted. Bevis shouted river. Next shouted together, dove flew firs went off. "What river this?" Bevis called presently. "O!" cried Mark suddenly; Bevis glancing round saw stumble, and, his endeavour save himself, plunge his spear water ground, steady himself; spear, though long, touched nothing his hand. He bent over. Bevis held his breath, thinking he must topple fall headlong; somehow he saved himself, swung round, immediately he could ran upon shore. Bevis rushed back. "What it?" he asked. "It is hole," said Mark, whose cheeks turned white, became red, blood came back. "An awful deep hole--the spear will not touch bottom." As he waded first shelving sand he laughed, shouted, jumped, suddenly, he stepped, his foot went edge deep hole; his spear, he tried save it, touched nothing, good fortune he recovered his balance. Once autumn, water low, dried long summer heats, hole visible nearly empty, stream fell cataract it, boiling bubbling, digging deeper. But now, water begun recede, full, stream ran slow, held back checked sea. This hollow quite ten feet deep, sheer descent, could see it, shore seemed slope shallow possible. Mark much frightened, sat root put his shoes stockings. Bevis took spear, going edge, leaning feeling bottom it, he could find hole, spear slipped touched nothing, two yards out. "It horrid place," he said. "How I got out? I wish could swim." "So I," said Mark. "And never let us go boat ourselves--I mean ship Unknown Island--till can." "No; will not," said Bevis. "We must begin swim directly. My papa show me, I show you. But I got fallen? Let see; there is gate there." "It heavy," said Mark. "You could drag down, fling quick enough. If raft here." "Ah, yes. There pole loose there--that would done." He pointed railings crossed stream. The rails nailed, pole side, thrust bushes. "I could pulled held you." Mark got his shoes on, started again, looking bridge cross stream, continue journey round New Sea. As could see determined cross railings, without much trouble, holding top bar, putting feet second, three inches water. The stream ran deep slow; dark, shadow, trees hung side. Bevis, first, stopped middle looked it. There thick hedge trees side, great deal fern banks. It straight good way, could see distance till boughs hid rest. "I like go there," said Mark. "Some day, get boat rails, let us go it." "So will," said Bevis. "It proper explore river. But river this?" "Is Congo?" said Mark. "O! no. The Congo near sea all. Perhaps it is Amazon." "It cannot Mississippi," said Mark. "That is long way now. I know--see runs slow, it is clear, do not know comes from. It is Nile." "So is," said Bevis. "It Nile, day go source." "What is swimming across there?" said Mark. "It far; I cannot tell. Most likely crocodile. How fortunate fall in." When crossed, whistled Pan, busy among fern bank, sniffing rabbits holes there. Pan came swam minute. They travelled way found ground almost level thick sedges grass rushes walked forest green waists. The water long way beyond weeds. They tried go it, ground got soft feet sank it; covered horsetails there, acres acres them, shallow water hidden floating weeds. Some coots swimming edge weeds far fear them. So returned firm ground walked among sedges rushes. There rough path, though much marked, wound get firmest footing, every jump wet place. "What immense swamps," said Mark; "I wonder ever shall get to." Underfoot layer dead sedges last year gave beneath weight, ground formed roots sedges plants. The water long since covered place were, surface still damp, sunshine could dry it, pass thick growth matted stalks below. A scattered willow bushes showed high water fibres stems flourished almost dried heat. A faint malarious odour rose earth, drawn rotting stalks hot sun. There shadow, wearied stepping sedges, sinking little every step, much increases labour walking. The monotony, too, oppressive, nothing sedges, flags, rushes, sedges horsetails, seem get much farther walking. First silent, labour makes us quiet; stopped looked back. The perfect level caused distance appear really was, thin invisible haze hovering swamp. Beyond swamp gulf gone round, across yellow sand-quarry facing them. It looked long way off. Volume One, Chapter VI. CENTRAL AFRICA. "We shall never get round," said Mark, "just see way come, half one side sea yet." "I wonder far back quarry," said Bevis. "These sedges tiresome." "We shall never get round," said Mark, "and I getting hungry, Pan tired rushes too." Pan, his red tongue lolling one side his mouth, looked up, showed his white tusks wagged his tail mention his name. He ceased quest time; he walking heels path made. "We _must_ go on," said Bevis, "we _can't_ go back; proper. Travellers like us never go back. I wish sedges. Come on." He marched again. But confessed tired, spurt soon died away, stopped again. "It hot Central Africa," said Mark, fanning his hat. "I sure Central Africa," said Bevis. "There hundreds miles reeds Africa, crossed Nile likely that is are." "It is like it," said Mark, "I sure it is Africa." "Then ought lions reeds," said Bevis, "or elephants. Keep spear ready." They went little way. "I want sit down," said Mark. "So I," said Bevis; "in Africa, people generally rest middle day fear sunstrokes." "So do; ought rest." "We cannot sit here," said Bevis; "it wet, smell nice: might fever, know, stopped still long." "Let us go hedge," said Mark, pointing hedge surrounded shore great way left hand. "Perhaps prairie there. And I thirsty, water drink; give apple." "But must go back," said Bevis; "I cannot that; would never let expedition fail." "No," said Mark. "But let us sit first." Bevis quite like leave sedges, he could gainsay heat, he weary, left rough path went towards hedge, pushing sedges rushes. It distance, came nearer ground gradually rose became drier, thick growth coarse grass plants, presently dense mass reed-grass taller shoulders. This bloom, pollen covered sleeves forced way it. The closer got hedge thicker grasses became, stoles willow, tall umbelliferous plants called "gix," gave unpleasant scent rubbed pushed stepped them. It hard work get through, last reached hedge almost done up. Now new difficulty, hedge grown close thick impossible creep it. They obliged follow it, searching gap. They could see yard front, could tell far might go. The dust-like pollen flying shaken grasses flowering plants got inside nostrils roofs mouths throats, causing unbearable thirst tickling. The flies, gathering crowds, teased them, would driven away. Now something seemed sting necks, and, striking place flat hand, stoatfly dropped, bloated blood, like larger gnat, attempt escape blow. Pushing plants stumbled hollow see account vegetation till stepped edge fell it. Mark struck his knee stone, limped; Bevis scratched his hands wrist bramble. The hollow little wet bottom, water, soft, sticky mud, clung feet like gum; scrambled quickly, really hurt, breath angry. They obliged sit down, crushing grasses, rest minute. "Let us go back path sedges," said Mark. "I shall not," said Bevis savagely. He got went steps, took his knife. "Could not cut way bushes?" he asked. They went nearer hedge looked, kept thick cattle might stray marsh. The outside twigs could cut course, hawthorn hard close-grained. With little tools pocket-knives would take hours--very likely would break them. "If something drink," said Mark. They apples. Though marsh, though shore, drop water; went back sedges could get water, would sink knees mud first. The tall reed-grass "gix," plants impeded progress, high enough protect least sun. The hedge ran north south, noonday gave shadow. As went slowly forward, Mark felt ground first his spear prevent falling another hollow. They pulled rushes, bit soft white part cool tongue. But stalks plants grass, easily bent taken itself, mass like began prove stronger were. They part arms first, like swimming, push through, ceaseless resistance wore power. Even Bevis last agreed possible, must go back path sedges right. After standing still minute recover turned right went towards sedges. In twenty yards Mark, sounding his spear, touched something splashed, he stopped thrust again, mistake, water. On going nearer, feeling bottom spear, Mark found deep too, he could reach bottom. The grasses grew right edge, water covered weeds that, prodded ground moved, would stepped brink it. The New Sea, receding, left long winding pool hollow shut getting path sedges unless returning weary way come. "This dreadful," said Mark, followed water little distance certain could cross. "We cannot get cannot go back; I tired, I cannot push much longer." "We must go on," said Bevis; "somehow must go on." He dreaded idea returning entangled vegetation. It less dense verge pool hedge, feeling way spear got while. Thirsty he Mark could drink weed-grown water; indeed he could see water weeds green scum, he pushed aside his spear surface bubbled marsh gases. Bevis persuaded drink it. Slowly worked on, marsh one side, hedge other. "Look," said Mark presently. "There is willow; cannot climb see round?" "Yes," said Bevis; changed course get it; nearer hedge. They felt ground rise, two yards higher willow, harder; sea came spot fact islet. There bushes it, brambles, elder flower; none grow water itself, flourish edge. There several tall willow-poles. Bevis put his bow arrows, took his jacket (the pockets stuffed full things), took hold pole, climbed up. Mark another. The poles large enough bear weight high; got six eight feet. "There is Sindbad's Island," said Mark, pointing right. Far away, beyond sedges reeds, broad strip clear water, across island Serendib. "If canoe." "Perhaps could make one," said Bevis. "They make sometimes willow--and oak, nothing cover framework; sometimes weave rushes close keep water--" "I plait rushes," said Mark; "I plait eight; would keep water. What is hedge?" They looked way; could see thick, close hawthorn, behind rose tall ash-poles, shut view completely. "It thick double-mound," said Bevis. "There is ash middle; like field, know." In front could see nothing endless reed-grass, except bushes willows interspersed among it, showing must numerous banks. Tired holding poles, boughs size enough rest on, let gradually slide down. As descended Mark spied dove's nest one hawthorn bushes; tired he he climbed pole again, looked higher level. There egg it; he half mind take it, remembered would awkward carry. "We shall never get home," he said, he told Bevis nest. "Pooh," said Bevis. "Here is something drink." He found great teazle plant, whose leaves formed cups round stem. In four cups little darkish water, since last shower. Mark eagerly sipped one most, though full drowned gnats; moistened his lips, he spluttered again. It unpleasant taste warm. "I hate Africa," he shouted; "I _hate_ it." "So I," said Bevis; "but we have got get somehow." He started again; Mark followed sullenly, Pan came behind Mark. Thus spaniel, stepping track made, least difficulty either. Pan's tail drooped, he hungry thirsty, he knew time dishes rattling kitchen home. "Listen," said Mark presently, putting his hand Bevis's shoulder, stopping him. Bevis listened. "I cannot hear anything," he said, "except midsummer hum." The hum loud air them, almost shrill, another sound. Now Mark called attention noonday silence wild deserted place strange. "Where things?" said Mark, looking round. "All birds gone." Certainly could hear none, even brook-sparrows sedges New Sea quiet. There nothing sight alive swifts immense height them. Neither wood-pigeon, dove, thrush called; even yellow-hammer. "I know," whispered Bevis. "I know--they afraid." "Afraid?" "Yes; cannot see Pan hunt about?" "What it?" asked Mark undertone, grasping his spear tightly. "There mummies here?" "No," said Bevis. "It is serpent, know; he is hundred feet long; he is come Unknown Island, he is waiting sedges somewhere catch something; birds afraid sing." "Could he swallow man?" said Mark. "Swallow man," curling lip. "Swallow buffalo easily." "Hush! what is that?" A puff wind rustled grasses. "It is snake," said Mark, he tore. Bevis close behind him, Pan his heels. In wild panic dashed quickly grasses, wearisome obstacle. But heat pulled ten minutes, panting. "Did see him?" said Bevis. "Just little bit him--I think," said Mark. "We have left behind." "He will find us track." "Let us tie Pan up, let swallow Pan." "Where is rope? Have string? Give handkerchief." They hastily tying handkerchiefs together, Mark, looking round see monstrous serpent approaching, shouted,-- "There is tree!" There large hollow willow pollard hedge. They rushed it, clasped shipwrecked men beam. Mark first, he got inside "touchwood," scrambled little way, he worked up, his back one side, his knees other. Bevis got underneath, "bunted" up. Bunting shoving shoulder hands. There brambles top; Mark crushed through, minute firmly planted top. "Give spear, bow, hand," he said breathlessly. The spear bow passed up: Bevis followed, taking Mark's hand last. Mark put point his spear downwards stab monster. Bevis fitted arrow his bow. Pan looked up, could climb. They watched long grasses narrowly, expecting see wave side side every instant, python wound his sinuous way. There rustling beneath, side hedge. Bevis looked saw Pan, crept through. "What going do?" said Mark, Bevis slung his bow his shoulder rifle, began move hollow top tree, became hollow split, partly arched over. Bevis answer: he crept cautiously top vibrated him; suddenly seizing lissom bough, he slipped let down. He inside hedge long baffled them. Mark saw instant, darted his spear followed. So soon he touched ground, set running. There sedges here, nothing short grasses herbage grows perpetual shade ash-poles, could run easily. The ease motion was, itself, relief, struggle reed-grass. When raced distance, felt safe, stopped. "Why, wood!" said Mark, looking round. Ash-stoles poles surrounded every side. "So is," said Bevis. "No, it is jungle." They walked forward came open space, round broad spreading oak. "I shall sit here," said Bevis. But sit down, Pan, woke he scented rabbits, suddenly disappeared hollow. "What is that," said Mark. He went see, heard sound lapping. "Water!" shouted Mark, Bevis came him. Deep narrow channel merest trickle shallow water, running, clear crystal. It came chalk, limpid. Pan could drink, could not. His hollow tongue lapped like spoon; shallow scoop palm hand, tube "gix," reed, oat straw, buttercup stalk suck through. They sprang channel itself, alighting place water cover, stream feet could drink. Nothing sparrow could done so. Presently Bevis stooped, his hands scratched away silt formed bottom, fine silt powdered chalk, almost like quicksand, till he made bowl-like cavity. The stream soon filled it, water thick, disturbed, wait till settled. Then lapped too, carefully, hollow palm, taking care water ran fingers fall below, bowl, weight drops would disturb again. With perseverance satisfied thirst; returned oak, took provisions; could eat now. "This jolly jungle," said Mark, his mouth full. "That is banyan," said Bevis, pointing knuckle-end drum-stick he gnawing oak them. "It is eleven thousand years old." Then Mark took drum-stick, his turn it. When polished, Pan it: he cracked across his teeth, hyenas cave days, animals never learnt split bones, earliest men did. Pan cracked disconsolately: his heart fleshpots. Boom! They starred. It peculiar sound heard before, seemed come immense distance. A pheasant crowed he heard jungle close them, second farther away. "What be?" whispered Mark. "Is anything here?"--glancing around. "There may genii," said Bevis quietly. "Very likely genii: everywhere. But I know was. Listen!" They listened: wood still; still, could hear moth chafer entangled leaves oak overhead, trying get out. Looking there, sky blue clear, sunlight fell brightly open space streamlet. There nothing hum. The long, long summer days seem gradually dispose mind expect something unusual. Out expanse light, earth tangibly midst vast illumined space, may come?--perhaps something common senses. The mind opens enlarging day. It said sandhills desert noonday sun emit strange sounds; rocky valleys vocal; primeval forest speaks depths; hollow ocean sends muttering becalmed vessel; mountains bound words set loose. Of old times huntsmen woods met noonday spirit leafy canopy. Bevis Mark listened, heard nothing, except entangled chafer, midsummer hum, and, presently, Pan snuffling, he buried his nostrils his hair bite flea. They laughed him, his eyes staring, his flexible nostrils turned his face alive stuffed. The boom come again, finished dinner. "I feel jolly lazy," said Mark. "You ought put things map." "So I did," said Bevis, he got his brown paper, Mark held he worked. He drew Fir-Tree Gulf Nile. "Write deep hole there," said Mark, "and awful crocodiles: that is it. Now Africa--you want long stroke there; write reeds bamboos." "No, bamboos, papyrus," said Bevis. "Bamboos grow India, now. There is some," pointing tall wild parsnip, "gix," verge streamlet. "I am lazy," said Mark. "I shall go sleep." "No will not," said Bevis. "I ought go sleep, ought watch. Get spear, take bow." Mark took bow sullenly. "You ought stand up, walk down." "I cannot," said Mark short. "Very well; go farther away, see round you. There, sit there." Mark sat edge shadow oak. "Do not see look channel; savages sure creep channel. Do see?" "Yes, I see," said Mark. "And mind nothing comes behind woodbine," pointing mass woodbine hung ash-poles, stretched like curtain across view there. "That is likely place tiger: keep eye sharp nut-tree bushes across brook--most likely you will see barrel matchlock pushed there." "I ought matchlock," said Mark. "So did; start had, glory us _get_ through. Now mind keep awake." "Yes," said Mark. Bevis, given his orders, settled comfortably moss foot oak, tilted his hat aside shelter still more, and, spray ash his hand ward flies, began forget. In minute he started. "Mark!" "Yes;" still sulky. "There is another oak--no, it is banyan farther; behind you." "I know." "Well, hear rustle there, it is python." "Very well." "And dead leaves sticks hole stump old tree?" "I see." "There is cobra there." "All right." "And shadow comes suddenly." "What is that, then?" said Mark. "That is roc Sinbad's Island." "I say, Bevis," Bevis settled again. "Bevis, do not go sleep." "Pooh!" "But it is nice." "Rubbish." "Bevis." "Do not talk silly." In minute Bevis fast asleep. He always slept quickly, heat exertion made forget still quicker. Volume One, Chapter VII. THE JUNGLE. Mark alone. He felt without going nearer Bevis asleep, dared wake lest he called coward. He moved little way oak his back, get clearer view sides. Then he looked sky, whistled low. Pan, half asleep too, got slowly, came him; finding nothing eat, disliking stroked patted hot day, he went back his old place, barest spot he could find, mere dry ground. Mark sat, bow arrow ready his hand, arrow string, spear beside him, his pocket-knife big blade open, looked jungle. It still silent. The chafer got loose, nothing hum overhead. He kept strictest watch, scarce allowing blink his eyes. Now he looked steadily brushwood he could see distance, his glance found way boughs, till presently, he searched crevices, he could command circle view. Like many slender webs his lines sight thus drawn mere chinks foliage radiated central spot, end he seemed he could feel anything moved much he could see it. Each webs strained his weary mind, even shade strong glare summer noon pressed heavily his eyelids. Had anything moved, bird moth, leaves rustled, would relieved him. This expectation continual effort. His eyes closed, he opened them, frowned blinked; he reclined one arm easier position. His eyes closed, shrill midsummer hum sounded low distant, loud, suddenly ceased--he asleep. The sunburnt woodbine, oaks dotted coppery leaves second shoot appeared, ash-poles rising hollow stoles, whose pale sprays touching formed green surface, hazel white nuts, stiff, ragged thistles stream bank, burrs brown-tipped hooks, hard dry ground, silent, fixed, held light. The sun slipped sky like yacht shore light wind coming bank fills sails, leaves surface smooth. Through smooth blue sun slipped silently, white fleck foam cloud marked his speed. But deep narrow channel streamlet change--the tiny trickle water longer illumined vertical beams, slight slant left run shadow. Burr! came humble-bee whose drone put he went among grass leaves, rose he travelled. Burr! The faintest breath air moved without rustling topmost leaves oaks. The humble-bee went on, disappeared behind stoles. A little flicker movement happened among woodbine, seen itself, something interrupting light like larger mote crossing beam. The leaves woodbine one place drawn together coated white web tiny bird came take away destroyer. Then mounting branch ash he sang, "Sip, sip-- chip, chip!" Again upper leaves oak moved jostling together caused slight sound. Coo! coo! dove beyond hazel bushes across stream. The shadow aslant rose stalks rushes channel. Over green surface ash sprays above, breeze drew rippled like water. A jay came farther oak scolded distant mate. Presently Pan awoke, nabbed another flea, looked round shook his ears, hair worn continual rubbing bushes he crept many years. He felt thirsty, remembering stream, went towards it, passing lightly Bevis, closely almost brush his hat. The slight pad, pad his paws moss earth conveyed sense something moving near Bevis' mind. Bevis instantly sat up, quickly, spaniel, half alarmed, ran yards. Directly Bevis sat he saw Mark fallen asleep. He thought moment, took piece string his pocket. Stepping quietly Mark he made slip-knot string, lifted Mark's arm put his hand loop wrist, he jerked tight. Mark scrambled terror--it might python:-- "O! I say!" Before he could finish, Bevis dragged two three steps towards ash-pole, Mark, thoroughly awake, jerked his arm free, though string hung it. "How dare you?" said Bevis, snatching string, Mark pushed back. "How dare you? you are prisoner." "I am not," said Mark angrily. "Yes, are; asleep." "I do not care." "I tie up." "You shall not." "If sleep post, tied tree, know have, left starve." "I will not." "You must, till tigers you. Do hear? stand still!" Bevis tried secure him, Mark pushed turn. "You are wretch." "I hate you!" "I will kill you!" "I will shoot you!" Mark darted aside took his spear; Bevis his bow instant began draw it. Mark, knowing Bevis would shoot his hardest, ran second oak. Bevis his haste pulled hard, let arrow slip he could take aim. It glanced upon bough shot nearly straight air, gleaming went--a streak light--in sunshine. Mark stopped oak, Bevis could fetch another arrow poised his spear threw it. The spear flew direct enemy, his haste Mark forgot throw high enough, he hurled point-blank, hardened point struck earth chipped crumbling pieces dry ground; slid like serpent way thin grasses. Utterly heedless spear, his rage he never saw, Bevis picked arrow place he slept, fitted notch string looked Mark, hidden behind oak. Guessing he there, Bevis ran towards it, Mark shouted him,-- "Stop! I say, it is fair; I nothing, you will coward." Bevis paused, saw spear lying ground. "Come take spear," he said directly; "I will not shoot." He put his bow ground. Mark ran out, his spear moment. Bevis stooped lift his bow, suddenly his turn cried,-- "Stop! Do not throw; I want say something." Mark, poised his spear, put grass. "We ought fight now," said Bevis. "You know exploring, people never fight then, else savages kill left; wait till get home, fight." "So do," said Mark; "but I shall left tied tree." "Very well, time. Now must shake hands." They shook hands, Pan, seeing danger chance knock flying stick, came forth bush he taken shelter. "But want everything way," said Mark sulkily. "Of course I do," said Bevis, glaring him, "I am captain." "But captain." "You big story." "I am not." "You are." "I am not." "People contradict me," said Bevis, looking defiant indeed, standing bolt upright. "I say I captain." Mark reply, picked his bat, fallen off. Without another word gathered his things, came question way go? Bevis would consult his companion; his companion would speak first. Bevis shut his lips tight, pressing his teeth together; he determined continue try get round New Sea. He sure, fancied keeping somewhat right. He walked channel stream, sprang across it, pushing his way hazel bushes, went direction; Mark followed silently, holding his arm stop boughs Bevis parted swung back sharply. After hazel bushes fairly clear walking ash-poles especially near oak-trees, open space it. Bevis went straight he could, wind round stoles sometimes make curve thick bramble bush way. As passed Indian file larger poles, Mark suddenly left path began climb one them. Bevis stopped, saw wood-pigeon's nest. The bird nest, though she felt ash-pole tremble Mark came up, hand hand, cracking little dead twigs, though her nest shook her, she stayed till his hand almost touched it. Then she flew pale green ash sprays, Mark saw two eggs, sticks nest made thinly put together that, bird gone, he could see light through, part eggs lying them. He brought one eggs his left hand, sliding pole slowly break it. The pure white wood-pigeon's egg curiously delicately mottled like pores finest human skin. The enamel surface, though smooth glossy, beneath water-mark texture like arm Queen Love, glossy white smooth, yet encased, imperceptibly porous breath violet sweetness announces goddess. The sunlight fell oval Mark, without moment's pause, took pin hem his jacket blew egg. So soon he finished, Bevis went again, came hawthorn bushes, much trouble push way, receiving several stabs long thorns. As awkward egg his hand, Mark dropped it. There path beyond hawthorn, little used, all, green, still path--a trodden line--and Bevis went along it, seemed lead direction he wished. By side path he presently found structure ash sticks, stopped look it. At end four sticks driven ground, two two, tops crossing make small V. Longer sticks laid V's, others across end. "It is little house," said Mark, forgetting quarrel. "Here is straw ground; thatch winter crawl under." (It three feet high.) "I do not know," said Bevis. "I am sure is," said Mark. "They little men, savages live here, they are pigmies, know." "So are," said Bevis, quite convinced, likewise forgetting his temper. "Of course are, that is path narrow. But I believe it is house, I mean house live in. It is place worship at, fetich." "I think it is house," said Mark. "Then where is fireplace?" asked Bevis decidedly. "No fireplace," said Mark thoughtfully. "It is fetich-place." Bevis went again, leaving framework behind. Across bars barley thrown autumn pheasants, feed darting dragging single ear time; thus keeping barley ground less waste. They knew well. "Bevis," said Mark presently. "Yes." "Let us leave path." "Why?" "Most likely shall meet savages--or perhaps herd wild beasts, rush along paths jungle crush everything--perhaps elephants." "So do," said Bevis, hastily stepped path wood again. They went ash-poles pigeons' nests numerous; counted five sight once, yards apart, could see far boughs. Some birds sitting, others not. Mark put his spear pushed one her nest. There continual fluttering round pigeons came to, left places. Never seen many nests--they walked long time, nothing look them, talk them. "I know," said Bevis, "I know--these savages think pigeons sacred, do not kill them--that is many." Not much looking going, came space poles cut winter, stoles bore young shoots feet high. There single waggon track, ruts overhung grasses bordered rushes, end it, turned, saw cock pheasant. They tried go stoles, thistles thick brambles briars many; could flourish till ash-poles grew tall kept away sun. So followed waggon track, led tall poles. To avoid savages kept sharp lookout, paused saw anything. There huge brown crooked monster lying asleep one place, could determine whether elephant unknown beast, till, creeping nearer stole bush bush stole, found thrown oak, bark stripped, exposed sap dried brown sun. So vast iguanodon may looked primeval days he laid rest brushwood. "When shall come New Sea again?" said Mark presently, moving slowly thicker growth. "I cannot think," said Bevis. "If get lost jungle, may walk walk walk never come anything except banyan-trees, cobras, tigers, savages." "Are sure going straight?" "How I know?" "Did follow sun?" asked Mark. "No, indeed, I not; walk towards sun go round round, sun moves." "I forgot. O! I know, where is compass?" "How stupid!" said Bevis. "Of course pocket time." He took out, he lifted brazen lid white card swung fro vibration his hand. "Rest hand pole," said Mark. This support steadied Bevis's hand, card gently came standstill. The north, three feathers, pointed straight him. "Now, way sea?" said Mark, trying think direction last seen it. "It side," he said, holding his right hand; he faced Bevis. "Yes, was," said Bevis. "It right hand, would east," (to Mark), "so go east must right." He started compass his hand, keeping his eye it, he could see stoles bushes, walked them, card swung he could make course. "What bother is," he said, stopping, "the card will not keep still. Let see!" He thought minute, he paused three feathers settled again. "There is oak," he said. "The oak east. Come on." He went oak, stopped again. "I see," said Mark, watching card till stopped. "The elder bush east now." They went elder bush waited: great thistle east next, afterwards bough fallen. Thus worked bee-line, slow almost quite true. The ash-poles rattled breeze freshened knocked together. "What lot leaves," said Bevis presently; "I never saw lot." "And deep," said Mark. They walked dead leaves little noticed them, eagerly engaged compass. Now looked ground covered brown beech leaves, deep, although feet sunk them, could feel firm ground, walked yielding substance. A thousand woodcocks might thrown heads hidden easily time year. The compass led straight leaves, till minute two saw narrow deep coombe. It became narrower steeper sides till approached end, chalk showed white dull crumbled, flakes hanging roots minute plants. "I do not like leaves," said Mark. "There may cobra, cannot see him; may step without knowing." Hastily he Bevis scrambled feet chalky side; danger obvious rushed escape discussing. When got alarm, found compass still told go on, could without scaling coombe. They got good way without much trouble, holding hazel boughs, hazel grows steepest chalk cliffs, chalk bare brambles, whose creepers came towards them; bramble creepers, like water, always come hill? Under chalk crumbled, gave way foot, put one foot higher slipped weight, returned level. Two rabbits rushed away, lost beneath brambles. Without conscious thinking walked aslant, gained feet every ten yards, came spot crust top hung over, roots beech-trees came curving hollow space search earth. To one clung turns, loose chalky clods fell them, hauled projecting edge. Bevis went first, took weapons Mark; Pan went long way round. At summit beautiful beech-tree, immense round trunk rising straight up, sat moss, always grows foot beech, rest struggle up. As sat turned round facing cliff, shouted once,--"The New Sea!" Volume One, Chapter VIII. THE WITCH. The blue water lost glitter, sun, freshening breeze, swept over, darkened surface. They far see waves, rising evident since water longer reflected sky like mirror. The sky cloudless, water seemed shadow, rough hard. It full half mile wood touched shore New Sea shut view, could tell far extended. Serendib Unknown Island opposite, could see sea round height sat. "We left sea behind us," said Mark. "The compass took us right away it." "We began wrong somehow," said Bevis. In fact walked long curve, thought New Sea Mark's right, really his left hand. "I must put map people must go west, east, never get round." "It must thousands miles round," said Mark; "thousands thousands." "So is," said Bevis, "and think nobody ever saw me." "What long way see," said Mark, pointing horizon blue wooded plain below, beyond sea, became hazy together. "What country that?" "I know; one ever there." "Which way England?" asked Mark. "How I tell I do not know are?" The ash sprays touching formed green surface beneath them, extending right left--a green surface every wood-pigeon plunged, closing his wings sea-birds dive sea. They sat shadow great beech, wind, coming wood, blew cool faces. The swallows left sky, go glide rising waves below. "Come on," said Bevis, incapable rest unless he dreaming. "If keep along top hill shall know going, perhaps see way round presently." They followed edge low cliff nearly could, walking beeches cool shady, wind blow through. Twice saw squirrels, quick, Bevis could get shot his bow. "We ought take home something," said Mark. "Something wonderful. There ought pieces gold about, butterfly big plate. Cannot see something?" "There is dragonfly," said Bevis. "If cannot catch him, say saw one made emerald, here is feather." He picked pheasant's feather. The dragonfly refused caught, he rushed air nearly perpendicularly; seeing another squirrel way ahead, left dragonfly crept beech trunk beech trunk towards him. "It is red squirrel," whispered Mark. "That is different sort." In summer squirrels thought redder fur winter. Mark stopped now, Bevis went himself; squirrel saw Pan, run along came beyond him. Bevis shot squirrel rushed tree, his arrow struck bark, quivered moment, stuck there. "The savages see one hunting," said Mark. "They sure see arrow." In minutes came hazel bushes, pushing lane hollow ten feet deep. They scrambled followed it, came boulder-stone, specks sparkled sunshine, doubt silver ore. Round curve lane emerged brow green hill, steep; left wood behind them. The trees hid New Sea, front, far off, rose Downs. "What mountains?" asked Mark. "The Himalayas, course," said Bevis. "Let us go them." They went along brow, delicious walking there, sun much lower, breeze cool, beneath meadows, brook winding through. But suddenly came deep coombe--a nullah. "Look!" said Mark, pointing chimney them. The square top, blackened soot, stood midst apple-trees, whose boughs young green apples showed. The thatch cottage concealed trees. "A hut!" said Bevis. "Savages!" said Mark, "I know, I will pitch stone chimney, get bow ready, shoot rush out." "Capital!" said Bevis. Mark picked flint, "chucked" it--it fell near chimney, heard strike thatch roll down. Mark got another, likely, found range, would dropped chimney time, Bevis stopped him. "It may witch," he said. "Do not know John told us? pitch stone witch's chimney goes bang! stone shoots air like cannon-ball." "I remember," said Mark. "But John dreadful story. I do not believe it." "No, I. Still ought careful. Let us creep look first." They got hillside difficulty, steep slippery--the grass dried sun. At bottom streamlet running along deep gully, little pool clearest water dip from, green sparred wicket-gate hawthorn hedge garden. Peering cautiously gate saw old woman sitting porch beside open door, black teapot window-ledge close by, blue teacup, she soaking piece bread, one hand. "It is witch," whispered Mark. "There is black cat wall-flowers--that is certain sign." "And two sticks crutch-handles," said Bevis. "But look there." He pointed gooseberry bushes loaded swelling fruit, nothing pleasant warm, thirsty day. They looked gooseberries, thirsted them; looked witch. "Let us run pick some, run quick," whispered Mark. "You stupid; she would turn us anything minute." "Well--shoot her first," said Mark. "Take steady aim; John says draw blood cannot anything. Do not remember, stuck last one prong." "Horrid cruel," said Bevis. "So was," said Mark; "but want gooseberries." "I wish moly," said Bevis; "you know, plant Ulysses had. Mind start next time must find some. Who knows fearful magic people might meet?" "It stupid think it," said Mark. "Do know, I believe she is mummy." "Why?" "She has not moved; I cannot see her draw her breath." "No she does. This terrible place." "Can get away without her seeing?" "I believe she knows we are now, likely saying." "Did she make curious thunder heard?" "No; witch is not strong enough; wants enchanter that." "But she knows it?" "Of course she does. There, she is moved her arm; she is alive. Are not splendid gooseberries?" "I will go in," said Bevis; "you hold gate open, I run out." "So I will; do not go near." Bevis fitted arrow string, went garden path. But he came near, saw peaceful old lady looked, he removed arrow string again. She took her spectacles he came up; he stopped ten yards her. "Mrs Old Woman, witch?" "No, I bean't witch," said old lady; "I wishes I was; I would soon charm crock gold." "Then, witch, let us gooseberries? here is sixpence." "You med want's  them; I shall not take yer money." "What country this?" said Bevis, going closer, Mark came beside him. "This Calais." "Granny, do not know be?" said girl, coming round corner cottage. She seventeen, pretty, bloom comes sweet faces age. Though boys tall, handsome; she put rose her bosom. "They Measter Bevis Measter Mark. You know, lives Longcot." "Aw, sure." The old lady got curtseyed. "You will come in, will not 'ee?" They went sat chairs stone floor. The girl brought plate gooseberries jug spring-water. Bevis eaten two he looking old gun corner; barrel rusty, brass guard tarnished, ramrod gone, still gun. "Will go off?" he said. "Feyther used make un," said girl. Next he found big black book, lifted covers, saw rude engraving plant. "Is magic book?" said he. "I do not know," she replied. "Mebbe. Granny used read un." It old herbal. "Cannot read?" said Bevis. The girl blushed turned away. "A' lazy wench," said old woman. "A' cannot read mossel." "I bean't lazy." "You be." Bevis, quite indifferent question, peering every nook corner, found nothing more. "Let us go," said he directly. Mark would stir till he finished gooseberries. "Tell way round the--the--" he going say sea, recollected would able understand he Mark expedition, would he say pond--"round water," he said. "The Longpond?" said girl. "You cannot go round, there is marsh-- unless goes back Wood Lane, nigh handy place." "Which way 'ee come?" asked old woman. "They come wood," said girl. "I seen um; spannul." She stroking Pan, loved her, she fed bone. She knew enormity taking strange dog wood breeding-season. "How um going get whoam?" said old woman. "We are going walk, course," said Bevis. "It is four miles." "Pooh! We have come thousands. Come on, Mark; we will get round somehow." But girl convinced time possible, marsh brook, showed shadows elms lengthening meadow outside garden foot hill. Bevis reluctantly decided must abandon expedition day, return home. The girl offered show way road. She led narrow path beside streamlet gully, along steep side hill, three four cottages, built slope, steep was. The path front doors kind breastwork, folk might inadvertently tumble roll--if quite sober-- gully beneath. Yet small gardens behind, almost stood end, vegetables appearing roofs. Upon breastwork mound planted flowers, yellow, yellow-tinged, marigolds, sunflowers, wall-flowers, stray tulip, gaudiest knew. These specks brightness dingy walls grey thatch whitened turf, chalk inch under, came instinct southern slope, hot Spain flaunts yellow flag. Six eight children about. One sat crying midst path, unconscious wrong he endured see them, step right his red head. Some stared unchecked rudeness; one two curtseyed tugged forelocks. The happiest sitting breastwork (of dry earth) eating small turnip he cut dirt rind rusty table-knife. As passed he grinned pushed turnip faces, much say, "Have bite." Two three women looked gone by, one cried, "Baa!" making noise like sheep, girl led flushed up, walked quickly, scorn rage, hatred flashing her eye. It taunt. Her father gaol lamb-stealing. Her name Aholibah, taunted her dwelling last syllable. The path went top hill, round red barn, could see village, detached cottages outpost, scattered slope, plain side coombe, quarter mile distant. "There is windmill," said girl, pointing tower-like building. "You go tow-ward he. He road. Then turn right till comes handing-post. Then go left, that will take 'ee straight whoam." "Thank you," said Bevis. "I know now; it is far Big Jack's house. Please sixpence," he gave her coin, he unconsciously held his hand ever since he taken pay gooseberries. It he had; he could keep his money. She took it, her eyes him, money; she would liked kissed him. She watched till she saw got straight road, went back, past cottages. They found road long, long dull, dusty empty, except young labourer--a huge fellow--lying across flint heap asleep, his mouth open flies thick his forehead. Bevis pulled spray hedge laid gently across his face. Except sleeping labourer, road vacant, every step took went slower slower. There lions here, monstrous pythons, anything magic. "We shall never get home," said Mark. "I do not believe ever shall," said Bevis; "I hate road." While yawned kicked stray flints, pelted sparrows hedge, dog-cart came swiftly behind them. It ran swift smooth even balanced, slender shafts bending slightly like spars yacht. It drawn beautiful chestnut mare, powerful far many, struck her fore-feet measuring space carrying car god sky, throwing her feet road elastic air beneath them. The man tall broad sat upright--a wonderful thing countryman. His head broad like himself, his eyes blue, he long thick yellowy beard. The reins strained taut like yacht's cordage, mare hollow his strong hand. They hear hoofs till he close, flint heap, searching best throw. "It is Jack," said Mark. Jack looked hard face, seem dawn upon till he gone past hundred yards, he pulled beckoned. He said nothing tapped seat beside him. Bevis climbed front, Mark knelt seat behind--so look direction going. They drove two miles Jack said nothing, he spoke:-- "Where been?" "To Calais." "Bad--bad," said Jack. "Do not go again." At turnpike took three minutes find enough pay toll. He divine mare, his harness, his cart perfect. Yet his broad shoulders he could barely muster groat. He pulled presently two fields house Longcot; he wanted go lane, alighted walk across fields. After got turning mount gate, mare obeying reins likewise half turned. Jack said,-- "Hum!" "Yes," said Mark top bar. "How home?" i.e. Mark's. "Quito well," said Mark. "All?" said Jack again. "Frances bruised her arm--" "Much?" anxiously. "You cannot see it--her skin's like plum," said Mark; "if pinch shows." "Hum!" Jack gone. Late evening tried hard catch donkey, Mark might ride home. It far, day he tired, Bevis. Tired were, chased donkey down--six times far Mark's house--but vain, moke knew old, charmed cowed. He showed his heels, failed. So Mark stopped slept Bevis, he done many times before. As lay awake bedroom, looking window opposite star, half awake half asleep, suddenly Bevis started his arm. "Let us war," he said. "That would first-rate," said Mark, "and great battle." "An awful battle," said Bevis, "the biggest awful ever known." "Like Waterloo?" said Mark. "Pooh!" "Agincourt?" "Pooh!" "Mal--Mal," said Mark, trying think Malplaquet. "Oh! anything," said Bevis; "somebody write history it." "Shall wear armour?" "That would bow arrow time. Bows arrows do not make banging." "No do. It wants lots banging smoke--else nothing." "No; chopping sticking." "And smashing yelling." "No--and that is nothing." "Only rifles," said Mark thoughtfully; "you see, people do not see one another; far off, nobody stands bridge keeps back enemy himself." "And nobody triumph afterwards elephants chariots, paints his face vermilion." "Let us bow arrow time," said Mark; "it is much nicer--and sell prisoners slaves get heaps money, like, plough cities do not please you." "Much nicer," said Bevis; "you often kill lot there is nothing silly. I shall King Richard battle-axe--no, let us Normans." "Would not King Arthur do?" "No; he killed, would stupid. I have great mind Charlemagne." "Then I shall Roland." "No; must traitor." "But I want fight side," said Mark. "How many get make war?" They consulted, soon reckoned fourteen fifteen. "It jolly awful," said Mark; "there heaps slain." "Let us Troy," said Bevis. "That is slow," said Mark; "it lasted ten years." "Alexander Great--let us see; he fight?" "I do not know; people nobody ever heard of--nobody particular, Indians Persians sort." "I know," said Bevis; "of course! I know. Of course I shall Julius Caesar!" "And I shall Mark Antony." "And fight Pompey." "But shall Pompey?" said Mark. "Pooh! there is Bill, Wat, Ted; anybody Pompey." Volume One, Chapter IX. SWIMMING. "Put hands rail. Hold far can. There--now let water lift feet behind you." Bevis took hold rail, level surface, leaning his chest forward upon water, felt his legs feet gradually lifted up, till he floated. At first he grasped rail tight he could, minute he found he need so. Just touch rail lightly enough, his extended body buoyant piece wood. It like taking stick pressing bottom, letting go, would shoot directly. The water felt deliciously soft him, bearing far gently grass, he fond lying. "Mark!" he shouted. "Do like this. Catch hold rail--it is capital!" Mark, somewhat longer undressing impatient Bevis, came it, floated, much delighted. The water three four feet deep. When Bevis's papa found could kept roaming, bent boating Longpond, different thing shallow brook, never far shore, could scramble, he determined teach Bevis his friend swim. Till Bevis could swim, he never feel safe him; unless his companion could swim too, use, case accident, one would sure try save other, perhaps dragged down. They begged hard allowed one boats order circumnavigate New Sea, difficult walk round; he promised would really try learn swim, boat reward. He took place near old quarry discovered, one corner Fir-Tree Gulf, bottom sand, shelved gently long way out; line posts rails running water, prevent cattle straying, could easily shallow like this. The field there, too, away road, could bathe times. It sunny morning, Bevis, eager his lesson, torn his things, dashed water, like Pan. "Now try one hand," said his "governor." "Let one hand lie water--put arm straight--and hold rail other." Bevis, rather reluctantly, he told. He let go his right hand, stretched out,--his left hand held easily, his right arm seemed float surface. But now, muscles his back legs unconsciously relaxed, his legs drew him, he bottomed his feet stood upright. "Why is that?" he said. "Why I come like that?" "You must keep little stiff," said governor; "not rigid-- quite stiff--just feel muscles then." Bevis again, floated one hand rail: he found he also keep his left arm quite straight firm. Then he two fingers on; Mark governor stood still, ripple might enter his mouth, inch surface. Next, Mark taken hand, learnt things; seen Bevis it, he least difficulty. The governor left awhile practise themselves, swam across mouth Nile, opposite side gulf. When he came back he found got quite confident; confident, Bevis, thinking surpass simple lesson, tried letting go hands, his chin immediately went under, he struggled spluttering. The governor laughed. "I thought would that," he said. "You want little--a little support, two fingers rail; must some, swim supply motion. But see little wanted." "I see," said Bevis. "Why, nearly swim now--cannot we, Mark?" "Of course can," said Mark, kicking his heels making tremendous splash. "Now," said governor, "come here;" he made Bevis go his knees shallow water, told put hands bottom. He so; he fours, facing shore, water reached his elbow, deep enough, he move backwards till touched his chest. He extend his legs behind him, till water lifted up, his hands remained bottom. His chest rested water, his body buoyed pleasant way he hold rail. By letting his arms bend give little, he could tell exactly much water would bear up, exactly strong him. He let sink till his chin water came halfway his lower lip, he his head well back, looked sycamore-trees growing field quarry. Then he floated perfectly, seemed least pressure his hands; little, little appeared nothing, he could fancy swimming. "Now walk along hands," said governor. Bevis so; putting one hand other, tumbler standing his head, moved ease, his body floating, weight all. One hand would keep him, even one finger he put stone bottom sink would done sand; he extended his right arm, tendency bring his toes bottom. Mark thing, crawled shallow water hands only, rest floating, laughing other. They could hardly believe water it; kept pieces wood. The governor left practise he dressed, made get out, long enough one morning. "Pan swim like do," said Mark, walking home. "No," said governor, "he paddles; he runs water he land." "Why could not that?" asked Mark. "You can, much use: get along slowly. When swim properly, copy Pan minute." The governor could go two days account business; full swimming, looked old bookcase, found book instructions, among things read frog best model. Out ran look frog; sunny none visible, till Mark remembered generally one ivy garden wall spread ground corner. In cool place found one, Bevis picked up. The frog cold touch even summer day, put cabbage-leaf carried stone trough yard. No sooner feel water frog struck crossed trough, first one direction, another, afterwards swimming round close sides, unable land, stone like wall. "He kicks," said Mark, leaning trough; "he kicks; he does not use his arms." The frog laid well his legs, kept his forelegs, arms, still, nearly so. "Now, what is good frog?" said Bevis; "men do not swim like that." "It is stupid," said Mark; "he is model all." "Not bit." The frog continued go round trough much slowly. "No use watching him." So went away, gone ten yards Bevis ran back. "He cannot get out," he said; placing cabbage-leaf frog, he lifted creature trough put ground. No sooner frog ground he went trough moist shade there, cattle drank splashed good deal over. When told governor, he said noticed correct, frog good model two things nevertheless; first way he kicked, secondly way he leaned his chest water. But man use his arms balance his body keep his chin mouth going under, besides assistance give oars go forward. Next morning went bathing-place again. Bevis hold rail previously, he got arm's length he told kick like frog. "Draw knees close together kick, send feet wide apart," said governor. Bevis so, thrust his legs sent right rail. He several times, ordered go hands knees shallow water, he done before, let his legs float up. When floated he kick, draw his knees close together, strike his feet back wide apart. The thrust time lifted his hands bottom resting, lifted right up, sent quite foot nearer shore. His chest forced water like inclined plane, he thus raised inch so. When impulse ceased he sank much, his hands touched bottom more. This pleased greatly--it quite half-swimming; he found necessary careful practising large stones bottom, he get shallow water, else he grazed his knees. In water scarcely feel kind hurts, many bather surprised upon getting find his knees legs bruised, even skin off, contact stones gravel, he unaware time. Mark difficulty same, even easier him, he imitate, hard following instructions. The second, indeed, often learns quicker first. They kicked along fine style. "Keep feet down," said governor; "do not let come surface, do not splash. Mark, drawing knees up, lifting heels; makes difference." He made hold rail deepest water could fathom--standing deeper water--and letting legs float, ordered kick there, keep arms straight stiff, attempt progress, practise kick. The object might kick deep strong, get habit shallow kicking, might walking hands sand. All lesson nothing kick. In day two water again, preliminary splashing, lot high spirits--otherwise would pay attention--serious business began. "Now," said governor, "you must begin use arms. You half-independent touching bottom already--you feel float without feet touching anything; must try float altogether. You know way I use mine." They seen many times, imitated motion shore, first putting flat hands together, thumb thumb; thumbs natural position, held palm; tips thumbs crossing (as sculls cross sculling); fingers together, squeezed tight, little interstice matters nothing, always squeezed tight causes strain wrist. The flat hands thus put together held four six inches front breast, shot out--not jerk, quick, savage jerk, wastes power--and palms extremity thrust turned partly aside, oar water till nearly vertical. Do attempt complete sweep--a complete half-circle--oar round far go easily without effort shoulders, bring back. The object attempting full sweep hands may come back easily, without disturbing water front chest checking progress, apt do. They slip back, thumbs held naturally, would lay flat hand table, meet resistance held palm. If fingers kept squeezed tight together hands brought back chest, vary hair's breadth level position stop progress exactly like oar held still water, difficult keep absolutely level. But fingers least degree apart, natural, hand inclines trifle, fingers involuntarily open water slips through, besides which, strain, hands return level much greater ease. The thrust forward easy--it learnt moment--you imitate first time see it--that bringing back often thought account. In fact, bringing back _the_ point, studied never swim well. This he told time time shore, watched he swam slowly them, purpose might observe manner. But use arms properly shore, pass air meet resistance, different using properly water. Bevis stand facing shore water deep his chest; stoop little--one foot front ease--till his chin nearly rested surface, strike his arms. He attempt anything his feet, simply stand try stroke. He put his flat hands together, pushed out, oared round he often done land. As he oared round pushed forward, he take step bottom; made walk step forward. This he repeat twenty times, governor standing by, much trouble make return his hauds his chest without obstructing his forward progress. Bevis became impatient swim arms legs together; he sure he could it, his arms, swept back, partly lifted pushed on. "Very well," said governor. "Go try. Here, Mark." He took Mark hand, one trial Bevis started swim, immediately his head went unexpectedly, he came spluttering, sit rail till he could get water his throat. While he sat good temper Mark his lesson. The governor went swim himself, rather tired reiterating instructions, leaving practise. On his return--he go far, far enough recover his patience--he set work another thing. Bevis go his hands bottom he done before, let his limbs float behind. Then he told try striking right hand, keeping left sand support himself. He so, his arm swept back pushed forward oar would boat. The next time he he kicked his legs moment, impetus kick motion his right arm together lifted his left hand momentarily bottom, sent along. This he without told, idea would occur one position. "That is right," said governor. "Do again." Bevis again, felt he three-parts swimming; he swam his legs, his right arm, touched bottom his left hand. After he repeated six seven times he lifted his left hand little way, made quarter stroke too, jumped shouted he could swim. Mark his lesson yards away, Bevis splashed water his excitement thick sand he disturbed. Bevis continued his trials, raising his left arm little every time till he could nearly use together. They set work hold rail, let limbs float, strike one arm, alternately left right, kicking moment. This get trick kicking striking hands together. Enough done morning. They came next day, governor left time almost practise learnt. They went hands sand, let limbs float, degrees began strike hands, first lifting left hand inches, more, till presently, became home water, could nearly use both. The next time bathed governor set Bevis fresh task. He made stand facing shore water deep his chest, lean forward gently it--without splash--and strike his arms legs together. He immediately, first trial, course stood directly. Next he told try make two strokes--one easily made, difficulty drawing knees bringing hands back second stroke. The chin almost certain go under, spluttering follow. Bevis his best, held his breath, let his head go well till he drew water his nostrils, compelled sit rail wait till he could breathe properly again. Mark tried exactly result. The first stroke feet pushed ground easy; he endeavoured draw his knees second, went his head. The orders received keep trying. Two days afterwards bathed again, though asked governor tell something else he would so, he ordered try nothing thing again, face shore strike out. If liked could push forward hard feet, done without splash, impetus would last two strokes, help keep body drew knees second stroke. Then he went swim across Nile left them. They tried hardest, went hands sand catch idea floating again. After succeeded, nearly together neither could claim first. They pushed ground hard, struck out, drew knees recovered hands, made second stroke. They hold breath it, mouths _would_ go under, still done. Shouting governor come back threw water, bold spaniels dashing in, wild delight. "You swim," said governor he approached. "Of course _can_," said Bevis, rushing field dance sward, back splash water again. That morning could hardly got away it, insisted bathing next day whether convenient not, governor obliged accompany them. This time he took punt, let row bathing-place. The lake deep poling. They boats before, could row well; remarkable nothing boys girls learn quickly rowing. The merest little boy five years old learn handle oar single lesson. They grounded punt undressed sward room. "Now," said governor, began swim two strokes again, "now this--stand chest, turn towards rail, finished second stroke catch hold it." Bevis found easy sounded, five six attempts he it, his motion stood back extra yard endeavoured swim three strokes, seize it. This difficult he could manage morning. Twice governor came punt, second time caught third stroke. They pushed off, one stroke, swam one good stroke floating, made third partly complete stroke, seized rail. "That do," said governor. He satisfied: his object beginning teach could teach themselves. With band beneath chest he could suspended (one time) punt deep water, taught them, he considered much better let gradually acquire knowledge far water would buoy up, would fail so, become perfectly confident, _too_ confident. For water, however well swim, thing played with. They seen everything could done water deeper chest, even less that, he reason believe left would venture till quite competent. He solemn promise go deeper water shoulders. If go chin, slightest wavelet lift feet, way many venturesome people drowned twelve inches safety. They might go shoulders, always condition facing shore swimming towards it. When thought could swim well enough go depth he would come watch. Both promised faithfully, received permission go next time themselves, short while, kept word, boat. If ladies chance read Bevis Mark learnt swim, seaside try plan? Choose smooth sea low tide (only shallow). Kneel water. Place hands sand, water may come almost shoulders--not quite, say them. Then let limbs body float. The pleasant sense suspension without effort worth little trouble costs. On softest couch limbs feel something solid, hard framework beneath, Sybarites put cushions floor feet couches. On surface buoyant sea nothing soft couch. They find pressure hands. They weight. Now let kick feet together, propulsion send forward. Next use one arm swimming style. Next use one arm kick time. Try use arms, lifting hand sand little first, presently more. Stand chest water, stoop somewhat bend knee, one foot front other, use arms together, walking time, get proper motion hands. Place hands sand again, try use arms more. Finally, stand chest, face shore, lean forward, push try stroke--the feet easily recover themselves. Presently two strokes become possible, awhile three; swimming. The sea buoyant, beautiful, let feel sense floating, never rest till learned. Ladies teach quickly, swim better do. The best swimming I ever saw done three ladies together: waves large, swam ease, three graces sea. Volume One, Chapter X. SAVAGES. Bevis Mark went eagerly bathe themselves, immediately left direct path. Human beings must kept taut, or, like rope, slacken. The first morning took leaping-pole them, slender ash sapling, rather twice height, picked number rick-yard, intending jump fro brook way. But got half way brook altered minds, becoming eager water, raced bathing-place. The pole oar, swim, supported oar, like shipwrecked people. So soon he plunge two, Bevis put one arm pole struck other, thinking he able way long swim. Directly his weight pressed pole went under, support least. He put next beneath his chest, arms it, immediately he pushed went again. Mark took got astride, pole let his feet touch bottom. "It is use," he said. "What is good people falling overboard spars oars? What stories must tell." "I cannot make out," said Bevis; he tried again, good, pole encumbrance instead support, insisted upon slipping water lengthways, would move he wished. In rage he gave push, sent ashore, turned swimming rail. They know it, governor, still anxious them, gone round long distance, peep hedge side Fir-Tree Gulf Nile. He could tell post rails go depth, went away without letting suspect his presence. When got out, run sunshine, dried much better towels. The field sloped gently right, usual run slope beside nut-tree hedge towards group elms. All way back sward short soft, almost like Downs could see, dotted bird's-foot lotus, whose yellow flowers raced. But morning, longer kept taut, returned elms enormous mushroom found there, ran old quarry, along edge above. The perpendicular sand-cliff fell enclosed pool beneath, which, going edge, could see reflected. Some hurdles flakes--a stronger kind hurdle--had placed cattle might wander over, cart-horses, rub everything, rubbed dislodged two three. These rolled down, rest hung half over. While stood still looking broad waters New Sea, sun burned shoulders, making skin red. Away ran back dress, taking short path across place turf partly grown shallow excavation pricked feet thistles, limp rest way clothes. Now, thistles proper racecourse elms back. As returned home remembered brook, went jump leaping-pole. But soft ooze bottom let pole sink in, Bevis, course must take first leap, near hung middle brook. Under his weight, he sprang off, pole sank deep ooze, stiffer mud pole would stopped upright, he must stayed water, jerked among flags. As let get over, he land firm bank, reaching mud side, he scrambled grasping stout stalk willow-herb. In future he felt butt pole till he found firm spot, sandy, matted roots grasses flags bound mud hard. Then he flew well grass. Mark took his turn, he put butt water streak mud came small jack fish shot away. So went bank leaping alternately, one carrying towels flew back. Sometimes could leap tripping bad, undermined cowslips spring hung stream, bored holes water-rats, disused become covered grass, give way beneath foot hoof presses pitching leaper rider current, rotten long-decaying roots, slip. Sometimes landing bad, undermined way, higher tripping, get over, deliver higher level; swampy, wet furrow came brook; far, nothing mud come on. They select jumping-places, feel ground edge first. "Here is raft!" shouted Mark, ahead, looking good place. "Is it?" said Bevis, running along side. They completely forgotten it, came upon like something new. Bevis took leap came over, set work launch it. The raft slipped gradually shelving shore drinking-place, thrust stream. Bevis put his foot board, immediately withdrew it, water rushed twenty leaks, spurting along joins. Left sand sun's rays wood raft shrank little, opening planking, clay daubed caulk crevices cracked, moss dried ready crumble. The water came every where, raft half-full even left without pressure. "We ought thatched it," said Mark. "We ought made roof it. Let us stop leaks." "O! come on," said Bevis, "do not let us bother. Rafts good, poles oars fall overboard. We shall ship soon." The raft old story, he care it. He went leaping-pole, Mark stayed minute hauled raft shore far his strength would permit. He got quarter ground, could float away, ran Bevis. They went Peninsula, looked fir-trees, see would mast blue boat have. As name, called blue boat distinguish punt. Mark thought ash-pole would mast, ash-poles straight could easily shaved right size; Bevis would hear it, masts never made ash, always pine, must ship proper. He selected tree presently, young fir, straight arrow, started Mark axe, he gone ten yards Mark came back, saying tree would use unless liked wait till next year, would green, mast ought, made seasoned wood. "So ought," said Bevis. "What lot trouble make ship." But sat railing across isthmus swinging legs, Mark remembered fir-poles cut long time since behind great wood-pile, walnut-trees, sight. Without word away ran, chose one carried she would Bevis usually worked. They got dead bark shaving away dinner-time, thought bore, wise old Pan, never chained now, considered main object life. Next morning went meadow, dew still lingered shade, way bathing-place, taking Pan time, hung path picking clover-heads sucking petals, pulling putting lesser ends lips, looking white pink bramble flowers, noting young nuts began show, pulling woodbine, everything hasten work swimming. They stopped gate New Sea, whose smooth surface slight breaths mist curling, stood kicking ground stones flighty horses paw. "We ought something," said Mark discontentedly. "Of course ought," said Bevis. "Things stupid unless something." "Lions tigers," said Mark, growling, showing his teeth. "Pooh!" "Shipwrecked people island." "Fiddle! They plenty always happy, not." "No; unhappy. Let us try escaping--prisoners running away." "Hum! Hateful!" "Everything's hateful." "So is." "This stupid sea." "There is nothing it." "Nothing anywhere." "Let us hermits." "There is always one hermit." "Well, live side," (pointing across), "and I will live this." "Hermits eat pulse drink water." "What is pulse?" "I suppose it is barley water." "Horrid." "Awful." "You say shall then." "Pan, old donk," said Bevis, rolling Pan his foot. Lazy Pan lay his back, let Bevis bend his ribs his foot. "Caw, caw!" crow went shore, he hoped find mussel surprised dawn shallow water. Bang! "Hoi! Hoo! Yah!" The discharge half mile away, crow altered his mind, flew water near surface he could without touching. Why birds always cross water way? "That is Tom," said Mark. Tom bird-keeper. He shot first, shouted after. He potted hare corn bits flint, button, three tin tacks, horse-stub, scraped old barrel inside, slew game. That himself. Then he shouted his loudest his duty--for people. The sparrows flown corn noise gun, settled hedge; Tom shouted frightened hedge, went back wheat. From learn this, shoot first shout after. "Shall say gun sea?" continued Mark. "They always heard night," said Bevis. "Pitch black, know." "Everything somehow else," said Mark. Pan closed his idle old eyes, grunted delight Bevis rubbed his ribs his foot. Bevis put his hands his pockets sighed deeply. The sun looked sons care, morning beamed. "Savages!" shouted Mark kicking gate slam startled Pan up. "Savages, course!" "Why?" "They swim, donk: do not they? They are always water, catamarans ride waves dance shore, blow shells--" "Trumpets?" "Yes." "Canoes?" "Yes." "No clothes?" "No." "All jolly?" "Everything." "Hurrah!" Away ran towards bathing-place savages, Mark stopped suddenly, asked sort were? They decided South Sea sort, raced again, Pan keeping pace kind shamble; he idle run properly. They dashed water, wood-pigeon's feather, found sycamore-trees quarry, stuck his hair. At first dive feathers floated away. Upon side rails large aspen-tree whose lowest bough reached water, shallow there. Though made splashing Bevis looked railings moment, he saw little roach moving fro bough. The wavelets his splashing rolled sandy shore, rippling aspen. As he looked, fly fell back tree, struggled vain get up. Bevis climbed rails, picked aspen leaf, put fly, thus raft, tossed Mark dived, floated slowly undulations strand. As he got rails kingfisher shot mouth Nile opposite, crossed aslant gulf, whistling he flew. "Look!" said Mark. "Do not know that is `sign.' Savages read `signs,' birds mean heaps fish." "Yes, ought proper language." "Kalabala-blong!" said Mark. "Hududu-blow-fluz!" replied Bevis, taking header top rail he sitting, he contrived balance moment without falling backwards. "Umplumum!" he shouted, coming again. "Ikiklikah," Mark disappeared. "Noklikah," said Bevis, giving shove he came breathe. "That is fair," said Mark, scrambling up. Bevis swimming, Mark seized his feet. More splashing shouting, rocks resound. The echo voices returned quarry high bank firs. They raced presently elms along sweet soft turf, sprinkling dry grass sparkling drops limbs, sunlight shone white shoulders. The wind blew stroked gleaming backs. They rolled tumbled grass, earth them. From water sun wind grass. They played round huge sycamore trunks quarry, massive boughs stretched over--from distance would seemed mere specks beneath immense trees. They raced across round hollow field sat bottom, could see nothing sky overhead, clouds drifting. They lay full length, moment still silent; sunbeam wind, soft touch grass, gliding cloud, eye-loved blue gave delicious sense growing strong drowsy luxury. Then shout, renewed, ran, Pan waiting clothes startled bark excitement sudden onslaught. As went homewards walked round little sheltered bay boats kept, look blue boat measure mast. It beside punt, half drawn sand, fastened willow root. She ill-built craft straight gunwale, afloat she seemed lower stem stern abeam, she would thrust her nose wave instead riding it. The planks thick heavy looked bent enough form true buoyant curve. The blue paint scaled faded, rowlocks mended piece cut old rake-handle, small pool bilge water sternsheets last shower, fall dead insects, yellow willow leaves. A clumsy vessel put together years ago by-water far distant Thames Oxford, good enough even unknown creek. She drifted somehow landlocked pond remained unused, hauled strand beneath willows; she could carry five six, bumped her well stones mattered little stout frame. Still she boat, keel curve, like lovers saw defect. Bevis looked hole seat thwart, mast would stepped, measured (not rule him) cutting twig length diameter. Mark examined rudder found lines rotten, hung dangling stern water long. Next stepped her length, stepping sand outside, decide height mast, ropes fastened? meant standing rigging. At home afterwards she would, Bevis shaved fir-pole mast, Mark set carve leaping-pole, South Sea savages everything carved. He could hardly cut hard dried bark ash, shrunk become like wood. He made spiral notch round it, searched till he found his old spear, ornamented altered bone harpoon. A bone kitchen sawn vice, half two inches largest end. Tapping broad chisel gently, Mark split bone sawn part, gradually filed sharp. He also filed three barbs it, fitted staff spear hollow end. While he engraving lines rings spear his pocket-knife, dinner interrupted his work. Bevis, wearying mast, got flints, hammered split flakes arrowheads, though he bruised his fingers, he could chip splinters shape. The fracture always ran far, far enough. John Young, labourer, came he sitting stool she would, watched him. "I see man once," said John. "How he it? tell me? what is trick?" said Bevis, impatient know. "Aw, I do not know; I see it. A' gate-hinge snopping um." The iron hinge gate, removed post, forms fairly good hammer, handle iron well head. "Where it? he for?" "Aw, Downs. Course he soil um." The prehistoric art chipping flints lingered among shepherds Downs, till percussion-cap came in, longer get flakes flintlock guns slowly let disappear. Young seen done, could describe how. Bevis battered his flints till he tired; he took last hurled away rage his might. The flint whirled hummed along ground till struck small sarsen boulder wood-pile, put spur-stone force careless carters drive straight. Then flew splinters jerk stoppage. "Here is sharp 'un," said John Young, picking flake, "and here is another." Altogether three pointed flakes Bevis thought would do. Mark bring reeds next day place grew half mile his house by-water brook. They green, Bevis could wait dry them. He cut little knot joint, split part above, put flint flake in, bound round round horsehair carter's store stable. But finished, shot off, lest break; carried indoors room upstairs bench, made armoury. They made four five darts next deal shaved thickness thin walking-stick, quite long. One end split four-- across that--and two pieces cardboard doubled thrust in, answering purpose feathering. There slight notch two-thirds shaft, way twist piece twine round crossed knot hold, end twine firmly coiled wrist, throwing string taut point dart fingers. Hurling string imparted second force, dart, twirling like arrow, flew fifty sixty yards. Slings made square leather sides old shoes, small hole centre stone might slip, could never much with, except hurl pebbles rick-yard, rattling boughs oak, side field. The real arrows shoot with--not reed arrows look at--were tipped iron nails filed sharp point. They much trouble feathering them; plenty goose-feathers (saved Christmas plucking), glue properly easy. Volume One, Chapter XI. SAVAGES CONTINUED--THE CATAMARAN. With efforts, could make blow-tube, used savages. Bevis thought thought, Mark helped him, Pan grabbed his fleas, together round blue summer-house; ate thousand strawberries, basketful red currants, ripe, wall close by, two young summer apples, far ready, yet could it. The tube ought least long savage, using it, tall. They could easily find sticks thickness, straight, difficulty bore them. No gimlet auger long enough; could bar iron, red-hot end; could keep true, always burned much one side other. Perhaps might managed inserting short piece tin tubing, making little fire it, gradually pushing fire burnt. Only, Bevis pointed out, fire would live narrow place without draught. A short tube easily made elder, nearly long enough. The tinker, coming round mend pots, put heads set make tin blow-pipe, five feet length; he promised do, sent day two. But he sheet tin broad enough roll tube one piece, he made four short pipes soldered together. Nothing would go straight joints quite perfect, inside roughness caught dart obstructed puff, good blow-tube must smooth well bored gun-barrel. When came look weapons, found got throw-sticks, boomerang. Throw-sticks soon made, cutting good thick knob; boomerang made curved branch ash, planed smooth one side, cut slight arch other. "This capital boomerang," said Bevis. "Now shall able knock rabbit without noise, frightening rest, come back kill three four running." "Yes, one mallards," said Mark. "Do not know?--they always far arrow, besides, arrow would lost hit. Now shall them. But way ought throw it--the hollow first, bend first?" "Let us try," said Bevis, ran boomerang she would field. Whiz! Away went, bend first, rose wind till impetus ceased, hung moment air, slid right, falling near summer-house. Next time turned left, fell hedge; another time hit hay-rick: nothing could make go straight. Mark tried his hardest, used ways, vain--the boomerang rose wind, and, far, acted properly, directly force thrown exhausted, liked, swept round left right, never returned feet. "A boomerang stupid thing," said Bevis, "I shall chop up. I hate it." "No; put upstairs," said Mark, taking him. So boomerang added collection bench-room. A crossbow next thing, made stock stout elder branch, pith taken out, left groove bolt slide up. The bow thick briar, bolt flew thirty forty yards, answer, could hit nothing it. A crossbow requires delicate adjustment, act well, must made almost accurately rifle. They shot hundred times sparrows roof, sooner driven came back like flies, never hit one; crossbow hung boomerang. Bevis, much practice, could shoot far better his bow arrow. He stuck apple stick, six seven trials hit twenty yards. He could always hit tree. Mark afraid throw his bone-headed harpoon tree, lest head break off; he another, without bone head, cast; he could generally hit tree. "Now quite savages," said Bevis, one evening, sat bench-room, sun went red fiery, opposite little window, filling room red glow gleaming faces. It put touch colour pears, growing large, outside window, ripe towards sunset. The boomerang wall lit light; parcel canvas, floor, bought Latten town, sails ship. There oyster barrel bench, contain fresh water voyage, much discussion put new head it. "We ought see shore spears things sailing round," said Mark. "So able land fear." "Poisoned arrows," said Mark. "I say, stupid! got poison." "No have. We must get lot poison." "Curious plants nobody knows anything us." "Nobody ever heard them." "And dip arrows spear's juice." "No one ever gets well shot them." "If wind blows hard ashore harbours awful savages along waiting us." "We shall see dancing shouting bows throw-sticks, yelling." "That is me." "Of course. And likely wind hard shall let sails, fling anchor stay till gale goes down." "The anchor may drag." "Then shall crash rocks." "And swim ashore." "You cannot. There is breakers savages behind them. I shall stop wreck, sun go down." "Red like that," pointing window. "And blow harder still." "Black pitch." "Horrible." "No help." "Fire gun." "Pooh!" "Make raft." "The clouds sure break, something." "I say," said Bevis, "will not things,"--pointing weapons--"do first-rate war?" "Capital. There arrows sticking everywhere battle-field." "Broken lances horses without riders." "Dints ground." "Knights backs trees heaps soldiers chopping them." "Flashing swords! ground shake charge." "Trumpets!" "Groans!" "Grass red!" "Blood-red sun like that!" The disc growing larger neared horizon, shone vast distant elms. "Flocks crows." "Heaps white bones." "And take shovels make tumulus shore." The red glow wall slowly dimmed, colour left pear, song thrush came orchard. "I want make magic," said Bevis, pause. "The thing make wand." "Genii best," said Mark. "They anything tell them." "There ought black book telling somewhere," said Bevis; "but I have looked bookcase there is nothing." "Are sure quite looked through?" "I will try again," said Bevis. "There is lot books, never anything want." "I know," said Mark suddenly. "There is bugle old cupboard-- war." "So will; I forgot it." "And flag." "No; must eagles stick." Knock! They jumped; Polly hit ceiling underneath handle broom. "Supper." When went bathe next morning, Bevis took his bow arrows, intending shoot pike. As walked beside shore often saw jacks basking sun surface water, yards distant. He fastened long thin string one end arrow bow, he might draw arrow back fish savages do. Mark brought his bone-headed harpoon try spear something, also carried plank, used catamaran. A paddle made tied convenience, hands might full. Mark went first one end plank his shoulder, Bevis followed his, hold edge rather cut them. Coming near weeds seen jack day before, put catamaran down, Bevis crept quietly forward. The jack there, motioning Mark stand still, Bevis went first railings stretched water. There he saw jack two pounds' weight basking within inch surface, aslant him. He lifted his bow he went near, shook string might slip easily like coil harpoon, fitted arrow, holding almost up, stole closer. He knew he pulled bow usual manner sudden motion his arms would send jack away instant. With bow already position, he got within six yards fish, which, quite still, seem see anything, sleep eyes wide open sun. The shaft flew, like another arrow jack darted aslant deep water. Bevis drew back his arrow string, altogether disappointed, struck water near exactly place fish occupied. But he thought string impeded shaft, took another trial. Mark would stay behind; he insisted upon seeing shooting, leaving catamaran grass, moved gently along shore. After found another jack, time much larger, less four pounds' weight, stationary tiny bay, curve land. He lying parallel shore, deeper first, perhaps six inches beneath surface. Mark stood he could see dark line fish, Bevis, bow lifted arrow half drawn, took one, two, three, almost another step forward. Aiming steadily jack's broad side, behind front fins, fish widest, Bevis grasped his bow firm keep least wavering (for left hand shoots), drew his arrow, let go. So swift shaft, unimpeded, drawn time almost head, traversing short distance between, jack, quick he was, could escaped. Bevis saw arrow enter water, and, seemed him, strike fish. It indeed strike image fish, real jack slipped beneath it. Bevis looked looked, he certain he hit it, he hit mark he aimed at, refraction, fish unhurt. It explained afterwards fish appears higher water actually is, hit he aimed two inches underneath, he proved truth trying touch things water long stick. The arrow glanced going two feet deep, performed curve water exactly opposite would traced air. In air would curved over, water curved under, came surface far out; water checked so. Bevis fastened string another arrow, shot first, caught held it, he drew back. They fetched catamaran, went till came point wall stones rudely put together shield land full shock waves, west wind rolled heavily Indian Ocean Golden Sea. Putting plank again, Mark went forward his harpoon, he knew shoals fish often played water still, beneath rocky wall. As he expected, morning, part roach, perch. He knelt crept fours edge wall, leaving his hat sward. Looking over, he could see stony bottom, ripple, he could see distinctly. He put his harpoon gently, without splash, sunlit water, let sink slowly among shoal. The roach swam aside yard it, showed fear touch them. Mark kept his harpoon still till larger roach came slowly within eighteen inches point, he jerked fish. It passed six inches behind his tail, though Mark tried again, thrusting quickly, he could strike his single point. To throw like dart he knew useless, deep down, could he hit small object motion. He could it, days afterwards he struck small tench brook, got out. The tench still, he could put head his harpoon almost it. They marched on, presently launched catamaran. It would support one time astride half water, capital thing. Sitting it, Bevis paddled along shore nearly rocky wall back, he forget his promise, his depth; he could see stones bottom time. Mark tried stand plank, one edge would go pitch off. He next tried lie his back, succeeded long he let his legs dangle side, balanced it. Then stood away, swam last plank wreck. "Look!" said Mark, done several times. He holding plank arm's length his limbs floating. "Look!" "I see. What it?" "This way. We ought held jumping-pole like this. This way hold oar swim." "So is," said Bevis, "of course, that is it; we will punt, try scull." Held arm's length, almost anything keep swimmer afloat; he puts his arm chest, takes good-sized spar. Splashing about, presently plank forgotten moment slipped away, and, impelled waves made, floated deep water. "I am sure I could swim it," said Bevis, he inclined try. "We promised not," said Mark. "You stupe--I know that; there is plank, that is dangerous then." "Stupe" word stupid. He waded till water his shoulders, tried lift him. "Do not--do not," said Mark. Bevis began lean his chest water. "If you are captain," cried Mark, "you ought to." "No I ought," said Bevis, coming back. "Get bow." "What for?" "Go get bow." "I shall not, say like that." "You shall. Am I captain?" Mark caught his argument, went sward bow. "Tie arrow string," shouted Bevis. Mark it, brought in, keeping surface. Bevis climbed railings, half water, he could steady his knees rail. "Now, give bow," he said. He took good aim, nail, filed sharp point, driven deep soft deal plank. With string he hauled catamaran gently back, would come straight; slipped sideways (like boomerang air), came ashore aspen bough. When came bathed air sunshine; rolled sward, ran. Bevis, he ran shouted, shot arrow his might see far would go. It went up, up, curving over, struck bough top one elms, stopped rooks' nests. Mark shouted danced bird's-foot lotus, darted his spear, heedless bone-head. It went hazel boughs hedge among young nuts, he could get till dressed, thistles. They ran chased sycamore trunks, visited hollow, shouting loudest, till distant herd looked grazing. The sunlight poured upon them, light air came along; bathed air sunbeam, gathered years health like flowers field. After dressed took catamaran quarry leave (somewhat sight lest one take firewood), save labour carrying fro. There savage another tribe quarry, crept fours, taking great pains he see them. It old man supposed look boats, generally watch water. Had occupied would heard thump, thump sculls he rowed, rather moved punt narrow mound separated New, Sea quarry. He work scooping sand, filling sacks best, cargo he would presently voyage home, retail dairymaids roadside inns eke spirit juniper-berries needful dwelt long marshy places. They need troubled conceal stranger savage; he would seen stood close him. A narrow life narrows sweep eye. Miserable being, he could see farther one mussels lake travel groove. His groove led sanded inn-kitchen, his she will shut else. But crept like skirmishers, dragging catamaran laboriously behind them, using every undulation ground hide themselves, till got hollow, left beside heap stones. Then crawl again, thirty yards along turf, till could stand unseen. "Let us get poison," said Mark, going home. So searched poison-plants. The woody nightshade knew well, warned long ago berries. It flower, would time berries; thinking decided gather bundle stalks, soak deadly juice. There stems arum ditches, tipped green berries. These thought would do, shrank touching. The green looked unpleasant slimy. Next hunted mandragora, John Young given account. It grew waste places, tombs churchyard, shrieked pulled up. This could find. Mark said perhaps wanted enchanter discover it, he gathered quantity dark green milfoil grass beside hedge paths, crammed his pockets it. Some lads told deadly poison. It reverse--thus reputation varies--for used cure mediaeval sword-cuts. They passed water-parsnip, unaware pernicious qualities, looking noisome hemlock. "There is another kind nightshade," said Bevis; "because I read old book indoors, it is much stronger this. We must it." They looked long time, could find it; and, full direful object, heed sounds laughter side hedge searching, till got gap jumped midst group haymakers resting lunch. The old men got little way apart themselves, wanted eat like Pan. All women together "gaggle," semicircle sitting round young girl lounged heap mown grass, huge labourer lying full length her feet. She piece honey suckle her hand, he black wooden "bottle" near him. There courting going two, women, married single, collected round them, aid business jokes innuendoes. Bevis Mark instantly recognised girl one "Calais" shown road home, man her feet fellow asleep flint heap. Her large eyes, like black cherries--for black eyes black cherries faint tint red behind them--were immediately bent full Bevis she rose curtseyed him. Her dress throat come unhooked, showed line sun browned her, sweet clear whiteness untouched skin began. The soft roundness swelling plum ripens filled her common print, torn briars, graceful contours. In shadow oak her large black eyes shone larger, loving untaught. Bevis speak. He Mark little taken aback, jumped gap suddenly savagery haymaking. They hastened gateway another field. "How keep a-staring arter they!" said huge young labourer girl. "Yen seen he afore? It is onely young measter." "I knows," said girl, sitting Bevis Mark disappeared gateway. "He put bough keep flies sleeping." "Did a'? Then did not axe 'un quart?" She slipped along fields road day, seen Bevis put bough her lover's face he slept flint heap--where she left him. The grateful labourer's immediate idea ask Bevis beer. Behind hedge Bevis Mark continued search deadly poison. They took "gix," certain true hemlock. "There is sort sorrel that is poison," said Mark. "And heaps roots," said Bevis. They near home, went extract essence plants had. The nightshade yielded little juice woody bines, stalks; "gix" much more: milfoil, well bruised squeezed, gave most. They found three small phials, nightshade "gix" filled quarter phials used them: Mark phial three-parts full milfoil. These arranged row bench bench-room crossbow boomerang, future use war. They dip arrows harpoon yet, lest poison fish animal might kill, render unfit food. Volume One, Chapter XII. SAVAGES CONTINUED--MAKING THE SAILS. The evening, got great plateful cherries, went work bench-room cut sails parcel canvas. There cherries town weeks before, first considered ripe country, generally later. With cherry his mouth, Bevis spread canvas upon floor, marked his pencil. The rig fore aft, mainsail jib; mast gaff, called it, yard, already finished. It took forty cherries get cut properly, threw pieces aside, placed sails floor position would fixed. "You sure they are big," said Mark, "if white squall comes." "There white squalls now," said Bevis his knees, thoughtfully sucking cherry-stone. "It is cyclones now. The sails right size, course take reef. You cut off--let see--twenty bits string, foot--no, fifteen inches long: it is reefs." Mark began measure string quantity largest make, bought purpose. "There is block," he said. "How going manage pulley haul mainsail?" "The block's bore," mused Bevis, rolling his cherry-stone about. "I do not think could make one--" "Buy one." "Pooh! There is nothing Latten; cannot buy anything." Mark silent, he knew true. "If make slit mast put little wheel window-blind something--" "That would first-rate." "No would not; would weaken mast, stupe, first cyclone would snap it." "So would. Then drift ashore get eaten." "Most likely." "Well, bore hole put cord that; would weaken much." "No; I know! A curtain-ring! Do not see, fasten curtain-ring, it is brass, mast, put rope through, runs easy--brass smooth." "Of course. Who is that?" Some small stones came rattling open window, two voices shouted,-- "I say. Holloa!" Bevis Mark went window saw two friends, Bill Wat, garden path below. "When is war going begin?" asked Wat. "Tell us war," said Bill. "The war's ready," said Bevis. "Well long going be?" "Make haste." "Everybody's ready." "Lots them. Do think shall want more?" "I know six," said third voice, Tim came round corner, waited steal strawberry, "and one's whopper." "Let us begin." "Now then." "O! do not make noise," said Bevis. The sails savages rather put war aside, Mark talked others, idea spread minute; everybody jumped it, cry War! "Make lieutenant," said Andrew, appearing orchard. "I want carry flag." "Come tell us." "How tell keep talking?" said Mark; Bevis put his head window pears, quiet. "I tell war's ready," he said; "and you are bad rebels--I mean you are mutiny come you are sent for, ought shot,"--("Executed," whispered Mark behind him)--"executed, course." "How know it is ready?" "You will summoned," said Bevis. "There muster-roll trumpet blown, you will march thousand miles." "All right." "And swords made, eagles, besides map roads grub,"--("Provisions," said Mark)--"provisions, course, rest, think war got ready minute, stupes!" tone great indignation. They grumbled: wanted big battle spot. "If bother much," said Bevis, "while I am getting fleet ready, shall not war all." "Are getting fleet?" "Here sails," said Mark, holding canvas. "Well, will not long?" "You will let us know?" "Shall tell anybody else?" "Lots," said Bevis; "tell lots. We are going biggest armies ever seen." "Thousands," said Mark. "Millions!" "Millions!" said Bevis. "Hurrah!" shouted. "Here," said Bevis, throwing remainder cherries like shower among them. "Are coming quoits?" "O! no," said Mark, "we much do; go away." The soldiery moved garden, snatching lawlessly fruit saw. "Mark," said Bevis his knees again, "these sails hemmed, know." "So will." "We cannot it. You must take home Frances, make her stitch them; roll go directly." "I do not want go home," said Mark. "And perhaps she will not stitch them." "I am sure she will; she anything me." "So she will," said Mark rather sullenly. "Everybody everything you." Bevis rolled sails, quite indifferent people him, put Mark's unwilling hands. "Now donkey, mind come back breakfast." "I cannot catch him," said Mark. "No; I--stop. John Young's sure stable, he can." "Ah," said Mark, brightening little, "that moke beast." John Young, stipulated "pot," went catch donkey; sat she would wait him, he come time went him. They met next field leading donkey halter, red fire running. They took halter sent John away "pot." There wicked thought hearts, wanted witnesses away. So soon John gone, Mark looked Bevis, Bevis looked Mark. Mark growled, Bevis stamped his feet. "Beast!" said Mark. "Wretch!" said Bevis. "You--you--you, Thing," said Mark; ground teeth, glared animal. They led fearful tree, little tree stout enough; ash, grew somewhat away hedge. They tied firmly tree, scourged miserable citizen. All times run vain catch him; times walk might ridden one behind his back; his refusals tempted; wrongs endured his heels boiled breasts. They broke sticks upon his back, cut new ones, smashed too, hurled fragments him, got more. They thrashed, thwacked, banged, thumped, poked, prodded, kicked, belaboured, bumped, hit him, working frenzy rage. Mark fetched pole knock harder heavy; Bevis crushed hedge, brought dead log hurl him, log he could lift swung throw difficulty,--the Bevis put aspen leaf carefully fly save drowning. The sky blue, evening beautiful, one came help donkey. When tired, sat rested, cooler recovered fatigue, loosed him--quite cowed time docile, Mark, parcel sails, got his back. After onslaught seem difference except his coat well dusted. This immunity aggravated them; could hurt him. "Put stable night," said Bevis, "and do not give anything eat." "And water," said Mark, he rode off. "So I will." And he did. But donkey cropped day, full, John Young caught draught, rather unusual equal omen, drinking-place raft. The donkey slept, beat them. After Mark gone Bevis returned bench-room, fastened brass curtain-ring mast, carried there. When he finished, noticing three phials poison he thought he would go see he could find fatal plants. There ancient encyclopaedia bookcase, he read many curious things, would considered practical enough modern publication, must dry nothing. Among rest page chemical signs used alchemists, he copied magic. Pulling volumes, piled haphazard, like bricks shot cart, one alphabets employed different languages, Coptic, Gothic, Ethiopic, Syriac, on. The Arabic took his fancy mysterious--the sweeping curves, quivering lines, blots reed pen thickened, knowing writing might mean. How mystic lettering forms running ornament Alhambra! It writing Orient, alchemist enchanter, astrologer prophet. Bevis copied alphabet, he made roll broad sheet yellowish paper torn end one large volumes, fly-leaf, wrote letters upon manner shape flowing contour arranged themselves. With he mingled alchemic signs fire air water, time dusk crept parlour filled shadow he completed manuscript. This he rolled tied string, intending bury sand quarry, sailed round ship might land discover it. Mark returned breakfast, said Frances promised hem sails, thought would take long. Bevis showed roll. "It looks magic," said Mark. "What mean?" "I do not know," said Bevis. "That shall find discover it. Besides magic never writing; see read it--it is like looking looking-glass, seeing people moving thousand miles away." "I know," said Mark. "We put sand-martin's hole, will not get wet rains." They started bathing-place, carefully deposited roll sand-martin's hole way face quarry, covering sand. To know spot again, counted found third burrow right, stood stone heap looked straight towards first sycamore-tree. Having taken bearings, dragged catamaran water, swim. When came out, running high ground sycamores, caught sight dog-cart slowly crossing field long way off, immediately hid behind tree reconnoitre new savage, unseen. "It is Jack," said Bevis; "I am sure is." It Jack, he going walking pace, track across field rough, he care get gateway man sent open arrived there. His object look grass rent his sheep. "Yes, it is Jack," said Mark, slowly doubtfully. Bevis looked him. "Well, suppose is; he will not hurt us. We easily shoot he comes here." "But letter," said Mark. "What letter?" Mark started his clothes, heap sward, he seized his coat, drew note much frayed one pockets. He looked it, heaved deep sigh, ran his might intercept Jack. Bevis watched tearing across field laughed; he sat grass wait him. Mark, breath thistles his feet, would never overtaken dog-cart Jack seen coming stopped. He could speak, handed note silence, like Cupid messengers generally. He panted he could run away directly, he intended. "You rascal," said Jack, flicking his whip. "How long pocket?" Mark tried run away, he could trot; Jack turned his mare's head, half-inclined drive him. "If come," said Mark, shaking his fist, "we will shoot stick spear you. Aha! you are afraid! aha!" Jack eager read his note take vengeance. Mark walked away jeering him. The reins hung down, mare cropped master read. Mark laughed think he got easily, letter his pocket week, though he faithfully promised deliver day--for shilling. Had he sent home sails might remained another week till envelope fretted through. Frances asked he given Jack. Mark started. "Ah," said she, "you forgotten it." "Of course I have," said Mark. "It is long ago." "Then really?" "How stupid are," said Mark; Frances could press further, lest she seem anxious Jack. So young dog escaped, he dare delay longer, Jack happened cross field meant ridden his house donkey. When Jack read note he looked retreating figure Cupid opened his lips, caught his breath say it. He put his whip aside he drove on, lest he unjustly punish mare. Mark strolled leisurely back bathing-place, he got Bevis seen. He looked round water, quarry, sycamore-trees. He ran water's edge his heart beating wild terror causing whirling sensation his eyes, thought instant came Bevis gone his depth. He tried shout "Bevis!" he choked; he raised his hands; he looked across water he suddenly saw something white moving among fir-trees head gulf. He knew Bevis, he overcome he sat sward watch, he could stand up. The something white stealthily passing tree tree like Indian. Mark looked round, saw his harpoon grass, missed bow arrows. His terror suspended his observation, else he would noticed before. Bevis, Mark ran letter Jack, sat sward wait him, by-and-by, still, looking water, his quiet eye became conscious slight movement opposite mouth Nile. There ripple, high ground he sat he could see reflection trees water undulate, though boughs shut light air surface. He got up, took his bow arrows, went firs. The dead dry needles leaves ground felt rough his naked feet, he take care step hard cones. A small bramble bushes forced go aside, took little time get near Nile. Then he always keep tree trunk front him, step slowly his head might seen he could see himself. He stooped ripples side brook became visible; gradually lifting his head, sheltered large alder, he traced ripples back shore bank, saw moorcock feeding roots willow. Bevis waited till cock turned his back, he stole another step forward alder. It ten yards willow hung water, he could get nearer, cover beyond alder-- true savage never content unless he close his game. Bevis grasped his bow firm his left hand, drew arrow quick steadily--not jerk--and sharp point covered bird, loosed it. There splash fluttering, he knew instantly he hit. "Mark! Mark!" he shouted, ran bank, heedless jagged stones. Mark heard, came racing firs. The arrow struck moorcock's wing, even bird would got away, point barb, diving struggling would come out, he near willow. The spike went his wing nailed thick root; arrow quivered stopped wood. Bevis seized neck drew arrow out. "Kill him! Kill him!" shouted Mark. The savage pulled neck, Mark, leaping jagged stones, took dead bird his eager hands. "Here is arrow went in." "There is three feathers water." "Feel warm he is." "Look thick red his bill." "See his claws." "Hurrah!" "Let us eat him." "Raw?" "No. Cook him." "All right. Make fire." Thus savages gloated prey. They went back bank firs sward. "Where shall make fire?" said Mark. "In quarry?" "That old stupe may come sand." "So he may. Let us make here." "Everybody would see." "By hedge towards elms then." "No. I know, hollow." "Of course, nobody would come there." "Pick sticks." "Come help me." "I shall dress--there brambles." So dressed, found Mark broken nail, Bevis cut his foot sharp edge fossil she will projecting one stones. But nothing, could think nothing bird. While gathering armsful dead sticks among trees, remembered John Young, always paunched rabbits hares got everything ready kitchen, said coots moorhens must skinned, could plucked "dowl." Dowl fluff, tiny featherets fingers remove. So carried wood collected round hollow field beyond sycamore-trees, took knives, haggled skin off. They built fire skilfully; made many Peninsula (for nothing pleasant making fire doors), learnt exactly it. Two short sticks stuck ground third across them, like triangle. Against frame number smallest driest sticks leaned, made tiny hut. Outside second layer longer sticks; standing, rather leaning first. If stick placed across, lying horizontally, supposing catches fire, burns middle all, ends go out. If stood nearly upright, flame draws it; certain catch; burns longer leaves good ember. They arranged rest bundles ready thrown wanted, put paper, handful dry grass, quantity least driest twigs, like used birds'-nests, inside little hut. Then completed pile remembered matches. "It is lucky," said Bevis. "If throw away. Matches proper." "Two pieces wood," said Mark. "I know; rub together till catch fire, one piece must hard soft." "Yes," said Bevis, taking his knife he cut end one larger dead branches collected, made smooth side it. Mark difficulty finding soft piece rub it, touched soft crumbled rubbed hard surface Bevis prepared. A bit willow seemed best, Bevis seizing first, rubbed fro till his arm ached his face glowed. Mark, lying grass, watched see slight tongue flame shoot up, come. Bevis stopped, tired, putting his hand smooth surface found quite warm, doubt could time. Mark tried next, Bevis again, Mark followed him; though wood became warm would burst flame, ought done. Volume One, Chapter XIII. SAVAGES CONTINUED--THE MAST FITTED. "This stupid," said Bevis, throwing back full length grass, crossing his arms his face shield his eyes sun. "They ought tell us stupid things," said Mark. "We might rub day." "I know," said Bevis, sitting again. "It is drill; it is done drill. Give bow--there, do not know Jonas made hole Tom's gun?" Jonas blacksmith, clever fellow his way, drilled broken nipple bird-keeper's muzzle-loading gun, working drill bow. Bevis Mark, always watch everywhere, saw it. They cut notch hole hard surface thicker bough, shaped another piece wood dull point fit it. Bevis took this, placed string his bow, twisted string round it. Then he put point stick hole; Mark held bough firm ground, immediately he began work bow backwards forwards, rotating drill alternate ways, he found end he pressed his chest would quickly fray hole his jacket. They stop cut another piece wood hole take top drill, Bevis pressed his left hand (finding need weight his chest), worked bow his right. The drill revolved swiftly, really near savages' fire-drill; expected flame come. The wood dry enough, point friction accurately adjusted; wood became quite hot, ignite. You may exact machinery yet able use it, possession tools make smith. There indefinite something touch master's hand wanting. Bevis flung bow without word, heaving deep sigh rage. "Flint steel," said Mark presently. "Hum!" "There is flint gateway," continued Mark. "I saw now; knock end knife--" "You stupe; there is tinder." "No is." "I hate it--it is horrid," said Bevis. "What is use trying things everything cannot done?" He sat his heels he knelt, looked round scowling. There water--no fire obtained thence; broad field--no fire there; sun overhead. "Go home directly, get burning-glass--unscrew telescope." "Is proper?" said Mark, much liking journey. "It is matches," said Bevis sententiously. Mark knew use, he go, he went, taking his jacket he started, he meant run good part way. It really far, his mind hollow time seemed twice long. After he gone Bevis soon found sunshine warm sit in, though busy working hardest never noticed it. Directly current occupation interrupted sun became unbearable. Bevis went shadow sycamores, taking skinned bird him, lest wandering beast prey--some weasel jackal--should pounce it. He thought Mark long time gone; he got walked round huge trunk sycamore, looked see immense boa-constrictor coiled among great limbs. He thought would day build hut platform poles. Far water he saw Unknown Island, remembered sailed ship knowing monsters enchantments might encounter. So he walked trees field look moly take them, resist Circe. The bird's-foot lotus he knew it. There one blue spot veronica still, another tiny blue flower he know, besides white honeysuckle clover grey bees busy, would scarce stir his footsteps. He found three button mushrooms, put his pocket. Wandering among buttercup stalks bunches grass, like butterfly drawn hither thither every speck colour, he came little white flower slender stem inches high, he gathered moly. Putting precious flower--good sorcery--in his breast-pocket safety, he rose his knees, saw Mark coming sycamores. Mark hot tired running, yet he snatched time enough bring four cherries Bevis. He burning-glass--a lens unscrewed telescope, sitting grass focussed sun's rays piece paper. The lens powerful summer sun bright, seconds tiny black speck, faintest whiff bluish smoke, leap flame, soon another, till paper burned, fire lit. As little hut blazed put boughs on, dead leaves attached sent thin column smoke. "The savages see that," said Mark, "and come swarming hills." "We ought made fire hole," said Bevis, "and put turf it." "What ever shall do?" said Mark. "They will minute." "Fetich," said Bevis. "I know, cut stick sharp end, tie handful grass it--be quick--and run towards elms stick up. Then they will think we are fetich, will not come nearer." "First-rate," said Mark, he went stick, thrust sward wisp grass tied top. Bevis piled branches, he came back large fire. Then difficulty cook bird? If put ashes, would burn spoiled; hung up, could make twist round round, iron pot boil it; earthenware pot drop red-hot stones in, heat water without destroying vessel. The thing could stick stick, hold fire till roasted, one side time. "The harpoon do," said Bevis. "Spit it." "No," said Mark; "the bone burn get spoiled--spit arrow." "The nail burn spoil arrow, I have lost one elms. Go cut long stick." "You ought go it," said Mark; "I have done everything morning." "So have; I will go," said Bevis away; he went nut-tree hedge. He soon brought back straight hazel-rod he cut point, bird spitted, held turns fire, sitting sward. It warm round, bowl-like hollow, fire bottom sun overhead, busy heed it. Mark crept hands knees side hollow Bevis cooking, cautiously peered edge see savages near. There none sight; fetich kept distance. "We must remember take burning-glass us go voyage," said Bevis. "Perhaps sun will not shine." "No. Mind tell me, take matches, too; sun shines use glass, he does not, strike match." "We shall want camp-fire go war," said Mark. "Of course shall." "Everybody keeps war," said Mark. "They are always me." "I found buttons," said Bevis; "I forgotten them." He put little mushrooms, stems upwards, embers fallen apart main fire. The branches burned became white directly, coated film ash, except centre look red, though glowing heat white layer. Even flames visible brilliant sunshine, paler colour hearth. Now thin column grey smoke, rising straight hollow, puffed aside summit light air wandering field. As butterflies came edge hollow heated atmosphere, fluttered high escape it. "I am sure it is done," said Mark, drawing stick away fire. The bird brown burnt one place, determined eat spoil over-roasting. When Bevis began carve his pocket-knife he found one leg quite raw, wings burnt, part breast leg fairly well cooked. These ate, little pieces time, slowly, silence, proper like it. But pick bones clean. "No salt," said Mark, putting piece he his hand. "No bread," said Bevis, flinging leg away. "We do not right somehow," said Mark. "It takes long time learn savages." "Years," said Bevis, picking mushroom embers, burned his fingers he wait till cooler. The mushrooms better, cups held juice cooked, retaining sweet flavour. They small, bite each. "I thirsty," said Mark. Bevis same, went towards water. Mark began run slope, Bevis suddenly remembered. "Stop," he cried; "you cannot drink there." "Why not?" "Why course it is New Sea. We must go round Nile; it is fresh water there." So ran firs Nile, lapped brook. On way home little boy stepped trees bank high, he could look them. "I say!"--he waiting them--"say!" "Well!" growled Mark. "Bevis," said boy. Bevis looked up, he could demean answer mite. The boy looked round see he sure his retreat trees gap hedge he could crawl through, would find difficult. Besides, would run bank, thick brambles. He got his courage together shouted his shrill little voice,-- "I say, Ted says he shall not play do not war soon." Mark picked dead branch hurled mite; mite dodged it, broke tree, he ran his life, follow. Bevis said nothing till reached blue summer-house home sat down. Then he yawned. "War bother," he said, putting his hands his pockets, leaning back attitude weary despair something. If rest would played, he would egged furious energy till did. As eager he care. "O! well!" said Mark, nodding his head he spoke, much indicate he care personally; still, "O! well! I know is, do not go war Ted one himself, battle somebody else. I believe he sent Charlie." Charlie mite. "Did he say he would war himself?" said Bevis, sitting upright. "I do not know," said Mark, nodding his head. "They say lots things." "What say?" "O! heaps; perhaps do not know make war, perhaps--" "I will biggest war," said Bevis, getting up, "that ever known, Ted's quite stupid. Mind, he does not cherries, that is certain. I hate him--awfully! Let us make swords." "All right," said Mark, jumping up, delighted war going begin. He eager others, he dare say so. Most afternoon cutting sticks swords, measuring length. Next morning governor went bathe, he wanted see getting swimming. They punt, governor stopped twenty yards shore, swim. Bevis dived first, blowing spluttering splashing managed get he could bottom his feet. He could gone that, new feeling know he his depth, made swim fast splash. Mark seen Bevis could it, knowing he could swim far Bevis could, much better. The governor satisfied said could blue boat, two conditions, first, still kept promise go depth, secondly, try see every day far could swim along shore. He guessed rather neglected swimming; learnt art tried improve themselves. He said he come twice week, see dive punt get used deep water. If would practise along shore depth till could swim rocky point rails, seventy yards, he would give present, could go depth. He obliged careful depth till could swim good way, he could always them, fresh water buoyant sea, young swimmers soon tire. The day carried mast up, fitted hole thwart. The mast little large, soon remedied. The bowsprit lashed ring painter fastened, inner end seat mast. Next gaff tried, drew fairly well curtain-ring. But one thing overlooked--the sheets, ropes jib, must work something, provided staples. Besides this, rudder fitted tiller instead ropes. Somehow like ropes; look like ship. This instinct right, ropes much use sailing; power rudder tiller. After fitting mast bowsprit unshipped them, carried home safety till sails ready. Bevis wanted Mark go ask Frances quick, Mark afraid return yet, Frances would know Jack he forgotten letter. Every bundles sticks swords, longer ones spears darts, rods arrows, brought soldiery. All taken upstairs bench-room, armoury, like things looked touched, look key room. Bevis always kept key his pocket now. They could fit head oyster barrel fresh water voyage, found large round tin canister tight lid, contain cornflour, would go inside oyster barrel. The tin canister would hold water, could put barrel, look proper. More sticks kept coming, knobbed clubs, till armoury crowded shafts weapons. Now Bevis consented go war, rest eager serve him, he easily got messenger take note (as Mark afraid go) Frances quick stitching. In evening Bevis tore another broad folio page fly-leaf one big books parlour, took summer-house, kept old chair--the back gone--which well table. Cutting his pencil, Bevis took his hat threw seat ran round inside; kneeling down, table low, he proceeded draw his map coming campaign. Volume One, Chapter XIV. THE COUNCIL OF WAR. "I say!" "Battleaxes--" "Saint George right--" "Hold tongue." "Pikes twenty feet long." "Marching two two." "Do stop." "I shall general." "That will not." "Romans shields." "Battleaxes best." "Knobs spikes." "I say--I say!" "You are donkey!" "They flags--" "And drums." "I have got flute." "I--" "You!" "Yes, _me_." "Hi!" "Tom." "If hit me, I will hit you." "Now." "Do not." "Be quiet." "Go on." "Let us begin." "I will,"--buzz--buzz--buzz! Phil, Tom, Ted, Jim, Frank, Walter, Bill, "Charl," Val, Bob, Cecil, Sam, Fred, George, Harry, Michael, Jack, Andrew, Luke, half dozen talking together, shouting across other, occasionally fighting, wrestling, rolling sward oak. There two tree, bellowing views above, little Charlie ("Charl") astride bough he got hold of, swinging down, yelling like rest. Some stood edge water, oak within yards New Sea, alternately made ducks drakes, turned contradict friends. On higher ground beyond, herd cows grazed perfect peace, swallows threaded maze them, grass. The New Sea calm smooth glass, sun shone cloudless sky, shadow oak pleasant; swallows come upper air, Bevis, he stood little apart listening abstracted manner uproar, watched swiftly gliding out. He convened council wanted join war fields, seemed best keep matter secret, could done came house, else perhaps battle would interfered with. This oak chosen known every one. It grew alone meadow, far path, could talk liked. They hardly met ten minutes confusion led frequent blows pushes, shouting great one could catch disjointed sentences. Mark came running map his hand; forgotten, he sent fetch it. As he came near, saw him, partial lull. "What awful row making," he said, "I heard across field. Why do not choose sides?" "Who is choose?" said Ted, he know he one leaders. He tallest biggest all, head shoulders Bevis. "You, course," came chorus. "And need not look did not want to," shouted somebody, laugh. "Now, Bevis, Bevis! Sides." They crowded round, pulled Bevis circle. "Best two three," said Mark. "Here is penny." "Lend one," said Ted. Phil handed coin. "You will never get back," cried one crowd. Ted rather known borrowing score his superior strength. "Bevis, you are dreaming," Bevis stood quiet motionless, still his far-away mood. "Toss." Bevis tossed, penny spun, he caught back his hand; Mark nudged him. "Cry." "Head," said Ted. Mark nudged again; head. Mark stamped his foot. "Tail," tail; Ted toss. "I told it," whispered Mark Bevis fierce whisper, "and did not." "Choose," shouted everybody. Ted beckoned Val, came stood behind him. He next biggest, easy tempered favourite, he would give away anything. "Choose," shouted everybody again. It Bevis's turn, course he took Mark. So far understood, Ted's turn, one knew he would select. He looked round called Phil, stout, short, slow-speaking boy, pocket-money, inclined books them. "Who shall I have?" said Bevis aside Mark. "Have Bill," said Mark. "He is strong." Bill called, came over. Ted took another--rank file--and Bevis, waking up, suddenly called "Cecil." "You stupe," said Mark. "He cannot fight." Cecil, shy, slender lad, came stood behind his leader. "You will lose everybody," said Mark. "Ted big ones. There, he is got Tim. Have Fred; I saw knock George once." Fred came, choosing continued, trying get best soldiers, till none left little Charlie, odd one. "He is good," said Ted; "you put pocket." "I hate you," said Charlie; "after times I have run messages you. Bevis, let come side." "Take him," said Ted; "but mind, you will one do, I shall get one else." "Then he will get bigger one," said Mark. "Do not him; he will way." Charlie began walk his head hanging. "Cry-baby," shouted soldiery. "Pipe eye." "Come here," said Bevis; Charlie ran back delighted. "Well, done it," said Mark rage. "Now Ted another twice big. What is use trying stupid! I never see. We shall whopped anyhow." Quite heedless reproaches, Bevis asked Ted his lieutenants. "I shall Val Phil," said Ted. "And I shall Mark Cecil," said Bevis. "Let us count. How many side? Mark, write ours. Have not pocket-book? well, back map. Ted, better same." "Phil," said Ted, much student, "you put names." Phil, reader slow way, he bidden. There fifteen Bevis's side, fourteen Ted's, choose another make even. "There is muster-roll," said Mark, holding map. "But shall know one another?" said George. "Who is friends, who is enemies," said Fred. "Else shall hit one another anyhow," said another. "Stick feathers hats." "Ribbons round arms would best," said Cecil. "Hats may knocked off." "Ribbons first-rate," said Bevis. "I will blue; Ted, red. You buy heaps ribbon nothing." "Phil," said Ted, "have got money?" "Half-a-crown." "Lend us, then." "No, I shall not," said Phil: "I will buy ribbons myself." "Let us skirmish now," said Bill. "Come on, Val," he began whirl his hands about. "Stop that," said Bevis. "Ted, there is truce, let fellows fight it is breaking it. Catch hold Bill--Mark, Cecil, hold him." Bill seized, hustled round behind oak, kept till he promised quiet. "But going begin?" asked Jack. "Be quick," said Luke. "War! war!" shouted half dozen, kicking heels. "Hold noise," said Ted, cuffing one his followers. "Cannot see we are getting fast can. Bevis, going fight?" "In Plain," said Bevis. "That is best place." "Plenty room big battle," said Ted. "O, you have got map, I see." The Plain great pasture beside New Sea, Bevis Mark bathed ran sunshine. It seventy eighty acres extent, splendid battle-field. "We are going march," said Mark, taking something lieutenant. "We are going march," said Bevis. "But I tell say so; I mean going march thousand miles, Ted; suppose that." "All right," said Ted. "But we are going camps," continued Bevis. "You are going camp outside hedge towards hills, live side, come way. Here,"--he showed Ted circle, drawn map represent camp,--"that is yours; side, towards house, shall come way." "The armies encamp sight other," said Phil. "That is quite proper. Go on, Bevis. Shall send scouts?" "We shall light fires proper camps," said Bevis. "And bring great-coats cloaks, hamper grub," interrupted Mark, anxious show he knew it. Bevis frowned, went on. "And I shall send one soldiers you, send one me--" "Whatever for?" said Ted. "That is curious thing." "Well, it is know begin. When there, we will hoist flag--a handkerchief stick--and hoist yours, war begin, send back soldier, I send back yours, cross running, soldier reaches you, mine reaches me--" "I see," said Ted, "I see. Then march begin quite fair." "That is it," said Bevis. "So begin minute, one other. I got ready, need sent people worry make haste war." "Well, I know never said anything?" said Ted. "And be?" said Val. "Saxons Normans, Crusaders, King Arthur--" "We are Romans," said Bevis. "Then Civil War," said Phil, read history. "Of course will," said Bevis, "and I Julius Caesar, Ted Pompey." "I will not Pompey," said Ted; "Pompey beat." "You must," said Bevis. "I shall not." "But _must_." "I will not beaten." "I shall beat easily." "That will not," warmly. "Indeed I shall," said Bevis quite composedly, "as I Caesar I shall beat easily." "Of course shall," added Mark. "You will not; I have got biggest soldiers, I shall drive anyhow." "No, will not." "I have got Val Phil Tim, I mean Ike, now--" "There, I told you," said Mark Bevis. "He is got biggest, Ike huge big donk fellow." "It is use," said Bevis, least ruffled; "I shall beat you." "Not you," said Ted, hot red face. "Why I will pitch water first." "Take time," said Bevis, shutting his lips tighter beginning look little dangerous. "Shut up," said Val. "Stop," said Phil Bill George, pressing in. "Hush," said Cecil. "It is truce." "Well, I will not Pompey," said Ted sullenly. "Then must somebody will," said Bevis sharply, "and choose again." "I would not mind," said one crowd. "Nor I," said another. "If I general I would not mind Pompey. Let me, Bevis." "Who is that," said Ted. "If one says I will smash him." When he found he could easily superseded he surrendered. "Well, I will Pompey," he said, "but mind I shall not beat." "Pompey ought win he can," said Val; "that is fair." "What is use fighting beat?" said Phil. "Of course," said Bevis, "how stupid are! Of course, Ted win he can; he is called Pompey make proper. I know I shall beat him, he is beat us he can." "I am called Pompey, mind," said Ted; "mind that. We win can." "Of course;" delicate point settled nearly leading immediate battle. "Hurrah Pompey!" shouted George, throwing his hat. "Hurrah Caesar!" said Bill, hurling his. This signal general shouting uproar. They quiet ten minutes, obliged let suppressed energy. There wild capering round oak. "Ted Pompey," said Charlie, little impudent, "what fun see run away!" For he his ears pulled till he squealed. "Now," shouted Mark, "let us get done. Come on." The noise subsided somewhat, gathered round Ted Bevis began talk again. "Caesar," said Phil Bevis, "if you are Caesar Ted's Pompey, we? We ought names too." "I am Mark Antony," said Mark, standing bolt upright. "Very well," said Bevis. "Phil, be--let see, Varro." "All right, I am Varro," said Phil; "and who is Val? Oh, I know,"-- running names his mind,--"he is Crassus. Val Crassus, hear?" "Capital," said Crassus. "I am ready." "Then there is Cecil," said Mark; "who is he?" "Cecil!" said Phil. "Cecil--Cis--Cis--Scipio, course." "First-rate," said Mark. "Scipio Cecil, that is name." "Write roll," said Bevis. The names duly registered; Pompey's lieutenants Val Crassus Phil Varro, Caesar's Mark Antony Scipio Cecil. After great flinging stones water shouting. "Let us see," said Ted. "If there is fifteen side, five soldiers each, five captains, five lieutenants." "Cohorts," said Phil. "A cohort each, hurrah!" "Do quiet," said Ted. "How go make row? Caesar Bevis, swords ready?" "No," said Bevis. "We must fix length, same." They got stick, much discussion cut certain length standard; Mark took charge it, swords cut it, none thicker. There cross-pieces nailed fastened on, ends blunt sharp. "No sticking," said Ted. "Only knocking." "Only knocking slashing," said Bevis. "Stabbing will not do, arrows will not do, spears." "Why not?" said Mark, looking forward darting his javelin Ted Pompey. "Because eyes get poked out," said Bevis, "and would row. If anybody got stuck killed, would awful row." "So would," said Mark. "How stupid!" Just people could kill one another without much fuss! "And hitting faces," said Bevis, "else somebody is marked bother." "No," said Ted. "Mind, slashing faces. Knock swords together." "Knock swords together," said Bevis. "Make rattling shout." "Shout," said Mark, bellowing his loudest. "How shall know we are killed?" said Cecil. "Well, _are_ stupe," said Val. "Really are." They laughed Cecil. "But I do not know," said Ted Pompey. "You think, shall know who is beat? Cecil's silly." "No he is," said Mark. "Bevis, managed?" "Those run away beaten," said Charlie. "You will see Ted run fast enough." Away he scampered escape punishment. "Of course," said Bevis. "One way people run away. O! I know, camp taken." "Or captain taken prisoner," said Phil; "and tied cord." "Yes," continued Bevis. "If captain taken prisoner, eagles captured--" "Eagles," said Ted Pompey. "Standards," said Phil. "That is right: proper eagles, Caesar Bevis?" "Yes," said Bevis. "Three brass rings round sticks do. Two eagles each, do not see, Ted, like flags, eagles, that is proper." "Who keeps ground wins victory," said Cecil. "Right," said Ted. "I shall soon tie Bevis--we must bring cords." "You must catch first," said Mark. "Captains must guarded," said Val. "Strong guards round awful fighting there," licking his lips thought it. "Captain Caesar Bevis," said Tim, spoken before, listened carefully. "Is punching?" "Hum!" Bevis hesitated, looked Ted. "I think so," said Ted, long arms hard fists. "If there is punching," cried Charlie oak, he climbed safety; "if there is punching, big blokes play." "No punching," said Mark eagerly, he feared, stout sturdy, seizing anything neutralise Ted's big soldiers. "No punching," shouted dozen once; "only pushing." "Very well," said Bevis, "no punching, tripping--pushing wrestling quite fair." "Wrestling," said Ted directly. "That do." "Stupid," said Mark Bevis; louder, "Only nice wrestling, `scrumpshing.'" "No `scrumpshing,'" shouted everybody. Ted stamped his foot, use. Everybody fair pleasant fighting. "Never mind," said Ted. "We will shove field." "Yah! yah!" said Charlie, making faces him. "If anybody what is agreed shall not done," said Mark, still anxious stop Ted's design; "that lose battle, even it is won." "It ought fair," said Val, big, straightforward. "If anything's done unfair, counts whoever it," said Cecil. "No sneaking business," shouted everybody. "No sneaking hitting behind." "Certainly not," said Bevis. "All quite fair." "Somebody must watch Ted, then," said Charlie oak. Ted picked piece dead stick threw him. He dodged like squirrel. "If say things," said Bevis, angry, "you shall not fight. Do hear?" "Yes," said Charlie, penitent. "I will not more. But it is true," he whispered Fred him. "Everything's ready now, is not it?" said Ted. "Yes, I think so," said Bevis. "You have not fixed day," said Val. "No, I have." "Let us to-day," said Fred. They caught clamoured battle once. "The swords ready," said Mark. "Are eagles ready?" asked Phil. "Two are," said Mark. "The two shall made afternoon," said Bevis. "Phil, go Latten blue ribbon us; here is three shillings." "Yes," said Phil, "I will get once--blue red, bring blue." "To-morrow, then," said Fred. "Let us fight to-morrow." But found three going to-morrow. So, discussion, battle fixed day after, begin evening, could come before. The camps made soon six of the clock possible, and, agreed to, council broke up, though understood anything else occurred one, captains wished make alterations, send despatches special messengers other. The swords eagles Ted's party fetched evening before, smuggled window dark, one might see them. "Hurrah!" So parted, oak left silence, grass trampled it. The cattle fed towards water, swallows wound around them. Volume One, Chapter XV. THE WAR BEGINS. As walking home Mark reproached Bevis his folly letting Ted, tall himself, choose almost big soldiers. "It is use hit you, pinch you, frown you, anything," grumbled Mark; "you do not take notice tree. Now Pompey beat us hollow." "If say more," said Bevis, "I hit you; donk. I want big ones. I like lightning-quick people, I have got Cecil, quick anything--" "What is use dreaming like tree ought eyes open; you are like battle--" "I tell knights biggest; often fought huge people monsters. And do not remember Ulysses served giant one eye?" "I like bore hole Ted like that," said Mark. "He is brute, Phil's cunning ever he be, you have lost battle." "I tell I have got Cecil, quick lightning, sharp ones, say I will not speak again, I will one else lieutenant." Mark nodded his head, growled himself, he dare go farther. They worked afternoon bench-room, cutting swords length, fastening cross-pieces. They talk, Mark sulky, Bevis his dignity. In evening Phil came ribbons. Next morning, making two eagles Pompey, Val Crassus came say he thought ought telescopes, officers field-glasses; Bevis said invented time war. The day warm, still, cloudless, and, fixed three brass rings long rod standards, Bevis brought old grey book ballads parlour orchard. Though he used often he could find his favourite place quickly, pages frayed broader others, would run fingers, adhered together. When he found "Kyng Estmere," he Mark lay grass shadow damson-tree, chanted verses, reading first, singing them. Presently came where:-- "Kyng Estmere threwe harpe asyde, And swith he drew his brand; And Estmere he, Adler yonge, Right stiffe stour stand. "And ay swords soe sore byte, Through help gramarye, That soone slayne Kempery men, Or forst forth flee." These repeated twenty times, minds full battle; Bevis said done war would study gramarye magic. Just afterwards Cecil came ask ought bugles, Romans trumpets, Bevis bugle somewhere. Bevis thought proper, use, nobody could blow bugle old Bailiff, he could get one long note it, dreadful put hands ears stood near. Cecil also said his garden home bay-tree, ought wreaths victors? Bevis said capital, Cecil went home orders Caesar get his sisters make wreaths bay triumph battle. Soon sunset evening Bailiff looked in, said sheet lightning north, he going call back men put tarpaulins two three loaded waggons, he thought, much dry, hot weather, would great storm. The lightning increased much, grew dusk flashes lit sky. Before sunset sky seemed quite cloudless, every flash showed innumerable narrow bands clouds, thin, behind electricity played fro. While Bevis Mark watching it, Bevis's governor came out, looking said would rain danger; sky-storm, lightning least mile high. But lightning became fierce almost incessant, sometimes crooked like scimitar flame, times jagged, sometimes zigzag; vast acres violet light, flooded ground showed every tree leaf flower, still motionless; which, though lesser flashes going on, seemed moment quite dark, much eye overpowered. Bevis Mark went bench-room, close sultry, sat open window swords Pompey bound two bundles standards, half afraid one would come them. Their shadows perpetually cast upon white wall opposite flashes came went. The crossbow lance, boomerang knobbed clubs visible, tools bench. Now then, violet flashes came, lightning seemed linger room, fill blaze stop moment. In darkness followed one heard voice call "Bevis" underneath window, saw Phil Val Crassus, come swords. Mark lowered bundles window cord, got still stood there. "Why do not go?" said Mark. "Lightning," said Val. "It is awful." It really powerful. The pears wall, everything however minute stood distinctly defined daytime. "It is mile high," said Bevis. "It will not hurt you." "Ted would not come," said Phil. "He is gone bed, covered his head. You do not know looks fields, yourself; it is well indoors." "I will come you," said Bevis directly; he jumped went them, followed Mark. "Why would not Ted come?" said Mark. "He is afraid," said Phil, "and I till Val said he would come me. Will lightning come brass?" The flashes reflected brass rings standards. "I tell will not hurt," said Bevis, quite sure, his governor said so. But walked field quite away house trees partly obstructed view, he amazed spectacle, meadow lit up; sky streamers flame rose other, till could tell flash confusion lightning. Bevis became silent fell one his dream states, when, Mark said, he like tree. He lost--something seemed take himself. He walked on, went him, till he came gate opening shore New Sea. "O, look!" said once. All broad, still water, smooth glass, shone gleamed, reflecting back bright light above; far away saw wood (where Bevis Mark wandered) plain noontide. "I cannot go home to-night," said Phil. Val Crassus said he could sleep his house, much nearer; he, too, hesitated start. "It _is_ awful," said Mark. "It is nothing," said Bevis. "I like it." The continuous crackling thunder deepened, boom came rolling level water wooded hill. Bevis frowned, held his lips tight together. He startled, he would show it. "I will go you," he said; though Mark pointed would come back themselves, he insisted. They went Pompey's lieutenants till Val's house, lit lightning, sight; returned. As came garden, Bevis said battle ought night, would read well history afterwards. The lightning continued far night, still flashed sleep overcame them. Next morning Bevis sprang ran window, afraid might wet; sun shining wind blowing tremendously, willows brook looked grey leaves turned, great elms orchard bowed gusts. "It is dry," shouted Bevis, dancing. "Hurrah!" said Mark, sang,-- "Kyng Estmere threwe his harpe asyde, And swith he drew his brand." This day great battle, impatient evening. There letter breakfast-table Bevis's grandpa, enclosing P.O.O., present sovereign him. He asked governor advance money two half-sovereigns. The governor so, Bevis immediately handed one Mark. About dinner-time came special messenger Pompey letter, Pompey's name, Phil's handwriting. "Ted Pompey Caesar Bevis. Please tell going send camp, let come stile Barn Copse half-past five, I send Tim till white handkerchiefs up. And tell lieutenants carry eagles, one else." Bevis wrote back:--"Caesar Pompey greeting,"--this style he copied his books,--"Caesar send Charlie you, he ran quick, though he little. The lieutenants carry eagles, soldier them. And Caesar wishes health." Then afternoon Mark go tell Cecil others, send message rest party, meet Bevis gate New Sea half-past five, mind one moment later. While Mark gone, Bevis roamed garden orchard, back stable sheds, rick-yard, strewn twigs branches torn elms creaked gale struck them; indoors, room room. He could rest anywhere, he impatient. At last he picked little book Odyssey, broken binding frayed margin, chair he last loft it; taking bench-room, opened twenty-second book, his favourite hero wreaked his vengeance suitors. With his bow his right hand, book his left, Bevis read, marching room, stamping shouting aloud he came passages he liked best:-- "Swift word, parting arrow sings, And bears thy fate, Antinous, wings! * * * * "For fate fear'd amidst feastful band? And fate numbers single hand? * * * * "Two hundred oxen every prince shall pay; The waste years refunded day. Till thy wrath just,--Ulysses burn'd With high disdain, sternly thus return'd. * * * * "Soon his store flying fates spent, Against wall he set bow unbent; And his shoulders bear massy shield, And his hands two beamy javelins wield." Bevis dropped his bow seized one Mark's spears, hearing, he stamped shouted, Mark coming stairs. Mark snatched one swords, Bevis turned rattled weapons together, shouted fierce joy. When satisfied stopped, Mark said he come New Sea, waves biggest he ever seen there, wind furious. They tea, rather sat table, rushed soon possible; cared eating war begin! Seizing opportunity, coast clear, Mark ran field eagles, which, long handles, difficult hide. Cecil Bill took greatcoat, railway-rug, Bevis meant represent his general's cloak. He followed basket provisions his shoulder, thinking lucky get without inquiries, he found forgotten matches light camp-fire. He came back, took box, going he met Polly dairymaid. "What now?" said she. "Do not spoil basket tricks--we use it. What is it?" putting her hand lid. "Only bread-and-butter ham, summer apples. It is picnic." "A picnic. What is ribbon for?" Bevis wore blue ribbon round his arm. "O! that is nothing." "I have half mind tell--I do not believe you are anything good." "Pooh! do not donk," said Bevis. "I will give long piece ribbon I come back." Off he went, bribed Scylla, he met Charybdis gateway, he came plump Bailiff. "What is now?" he gruffly inquired. "Picnic." "Mind do not go bathing; waves big cows." "Bathing," said Bevis, intense contempt. "We do not bathe evening. Here, you--" donk, he going say, forebore; he gave Bailiff summer apple, went on. The Bailiff bit apple, muttered "mischief," walked towards rick-yard. In minute Mark came meet Bevis. "You him?" he said. "Yes," said Bevis, "and Polly too." "Hurrah!" shouted Mark. "They are one, he is coming five minutes." Bevis found his army assembled gate leading New Sea. Each soldier wore blue ribbon round left arm distinction; Tim, sent Pompey till ready, wore red one. "Two two," said Caesar Bevis, taking his sword instantly assuming general's authoritative tone. He marshalled double file, one eagle front, one halfway down, his second lieutenant, Scipio Cecil, stood; basket carried rear baggage. Caesar Mark Antony stood front side side. "March," said Bevis, starting, followed him. The route beside shore, soon left shelter trees wind seemed hit furious blow, pushed order moment. The farther went harder wind blow, flecks brown foam, like yeast, came caught them. Rolling direction marching, waves undulation increased size, came bluff Bevis walked slowly minute, look dark hollows ridges whose crests foam driven. But leaving shore he led army, brazen eagles gleaming sun, slope meadow solitary oak stood, beside hedge-row till reached higher ground. The Plain, chosen battle-field, side hedge, arranged camps pitched without actual campaigning-ground. On elevated place gale came along even greater fury; Mark Antony said would never able light camp-fire side, must get shelter. "I shall I said," shouted Bevis, scarcely audible, wind blew words his throat. But he kept till he found hawthorn bush, brambles base, detached thicket two three yards hedge, near gap. He stopped, ordered standard-bearer behind pitch eagle there. The army halted, eagles pitched thrusting end rods sward, cloaks, coats, rug thrown together heap, soldiers set work gather sticks fire. Of found plenty hedge, piled shelter detached thicket. Bevis, Mark Antony, Scipio Cecil went gap reconnoitre enemy. They immediately saw smoke his camp-fire rising side Plain, close gateway. The smoke rose little hedge there--the fire side--and blown away wind. None Pompey's forces visible. "Ted, I mean Pompey, first," said Mark Antony. "He will ready us." "Be quick fire," shouted Caesar. "Look," said Scipio Cecil. "There is punt." Behind stony promontory quarry could see punt high ground stood; partly drawn ashore inside Fir-Tree Gulf, projecting point protected like breakwater. The old man (the watcher) started quarry get load sand usual, never thinking, he think? gale furious. But he found driven along anyhow, unable row back; he could steer struggle gulf, behind Point, he beached his unwieldy vessel. Too much shaken dig sand day, knowing he could row back, he hid his spade oars, made home foot. But journey land dangerous sea, he insensibly wandered high road, came anchor first inn, where, relating his adventures deep assistance ardent liquor, he remained. Bevis, gone light fire matches his pocket, returned gap, asked anything seen Pompey's men. As he spoke Pompeian appeared, mounting spars distant gate displayed standard, attached white handkerchief, fluttered breeze. "They are ready," said Mark Antony. "Come on. Which way shall march? Which way going?" The smoke Caesar's fire rose hedge, swept gale trailed along ground towards Pompey's. Bevis hastened back camp, tied his handkerchief top eagle, Mark followed. "Which way going?" he repeated. "Where shall meet them? What going do?" "I do not know," said Caesar, angrily pushing him. "Get away." "There," growled Mark Antony Scipio, "he does not know he is going do, Phil cunning as--" The standard-bearer sent Caesar pushed him, got gap, held white flag, waving attract attention. In half minute, Pompey's flag hauled down, directly afterwards one climbed gate set running towards them. It Charlie. "Run, Tim," said Caesar Bevis; "we are ready." Tim dashed gap, set his might. "Two two," shouted Caesar. "Stand still, you?" moved towards opening. "Take flag." The eagle-bearer resumed his place behind him. Caesar signing legions remain were, went forward stood mound. He watched runners saw pass nearly middle great field, though little, Charlie swift foot, full energy effective size. "Let us go." "Now then." "Start." The legions impatient stamped feet, Caesar would move. In minute two Charlie reached him, red panting running. "Now," shouted Bevis, "march!" he leaped field; Charlie came next he would wait take his place ranks. The legions rushed anyhow, eager begin fray. "Two two," shouted Caesar, would disorder. "Two two," repeated his first lieutenant, Mark Antony. "Two two," said Scipio Cecil, punching his men place. On went, Caesar leading, straight across wind-swept plain Pompey's camp. The black swifts flew them, clearing grass, passing close seem almost foot. There hundreds them, come upper air, congregate great gale; glided field endless turns windings. Steadily marching, army advanced third part way across field. "Where is Pompey?" said Scipio Cecil. "Where shall meet fight?" said Mark Antony. "Silence," shouted Bevis, "or I will degrade rank, shall not officers." They silent, every one looking Pompey thinking same. There gate full view now, smoke Pompey's camp, none enemy visible. Bevis thinking trying make whether Pompey waiting his camp, whether he gone round behind hedge, so, way, right towards quarry, left towards copse, he could decide, nothing guide him. But though uncertain his mind, he general enough let army suppose doubt. He strode silence, keeping sharpest watch, till came waggon track, crossing field left right. It worn gully hollow way leading right hazel hedge, gate. They came edge hollow way, three thick hawthorn bushes two small ash-trees. "Halt!" said Caesar Bevis, bushes partly concealed view. "Stay here. Let one move." Bevis went round trees looked again, he could see nothing: Pompey his army nowhere sight. He could tell do, returned slowly, thinking, looking hollow way idea struck him. "Scipio, take men,"--("Cohort," said Antony)--"take cohort, jump road, go gate there. Keep sight-- stoop: slip gate, go inside hedge, dart round corner seize Ted's camp. Quick! And mind, they are there, course you are fight, come back. Now--quick." Scipio Cecil jumped hollow way followed his five soldiers, stooping hidden bank, ran towards gate hazel hedge. They watched till cohort got gate. "Now shall do?" said Mark Antony. "How I tell Pompey is not anywhere?" said Bevis, rage. "Put tree," said Charlie, "perhaps I could see." "You have business speak," said Bevis; he used idea, told two "bunt" (shove) Charlie one ash-trees till he could grasp branch. Then Charlie, agile squirrel, minute. "There is one camp," he shouted down. "Cecil's rushing it. Pompey, O! I see him." "Where?" "There copse," pointing left partly behind them. "Which way he going?" asked Bevis. "That way,"--to left. "Our camp," said Mark. "That is it," said Bevis. "Come down, quick. Turn left," (to army). "No, stop. Charlie, many Pompey?" "Six, ten--oh, I cannot count: I believe it is all. I cannot see anywhere else." "Quick!" shouted Bevis, turning his legions left. "Quick march! Run!" Volume One, Chapter XVI. THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. They left Charlie get he could, started sharp pace meet intercept Pompey. Now, Pompey continued his course behind hedge way, he must got Caesar's camp first; Caesar could crush hedge. But Pompey came gate, waggon track issued field, he saw he could make short cut thence gap Caesar's camp, instead marching round irregular curve hedge. Caesar, though running fast meet him, moment passing depression ground, sight. Pompey seized favourable opportunity, came gate, ordering "Quick march!" ran towards gap. When Caesar came depression he saw Pompey's whole army running backs almost turned away towards gap camp. They seemed flee, Caesar's legions beholding enemies' backs, raised shout. Pompey heard, looking round, saw Caesar charging towards his rear. He halted faced about, time saw his camp Caesar's possession; eagle gate there, his baggage pitched over. Nothing daunted, Pompey ordered his soldiers advance, pushed his hands line, placing Crassus Varro, one either end. As he came running, Caesar saw whole Pompey's army them, he two-thirds his, regretted he hastily detached Scipio's cohort. But waving his sword, he ran head his men, keeping column. They hundred yards apart, Pompey faced about, short distance rapidly traversed. Caesar's sword first descend crash upon enemy's weapon, Antony hardly second later, could lift strike again, legion behind, shout, pushed impetus right Pompey's line. When Caesar Bevis stopped running, looked round, break enemy's army, divided two parts. Bevis instantly made part his left (where Phil Varro commanded), thinking, instinctively, crush half his soldiers. But know his object was, he time even give order, four five followed him. The rest paused faced Val Crassus; Ted Pompey six seven his men attacked. Bevis met Phil Varro, crossed swords him. Clatter! crash! snap! thump! bang! They slashed warded: Bevis's shoulder stung sharp blow. He struck back, his sword sliding Varro's, broke cross-piece, rapped his fingers smartly. Before Varro could hit again, two others, fighting, stumbled across interrupted combat. "Keep together! Keep together!" shouted Phil Varro. "Ted--Pompey, Pompey! Keep together!" Slash! swish! crash! thump! "Hit him! Now then! He is down! Hurrah!" Crash! Crack--a sword split flew splinters. "Follow Bevis!" shouted Mark, "Stick Bevis! Fred! Bill! Quick!" He privately arranged two, Fred Bill, biggest side, three keep close Bevis form guard. Mark shrewd, he guessed Ted Pompey, much stronger well-supported stout soldiers, would make every effort seize Caesar, slightly built, bind prisoner. He tell Bevis he arranged this, Bevis stickler his imperial authority, Mark told him, would quite likely countermand it. Whirling his sword terrible fury, Caesar Bevis cut his way between. Slight he was, intense energy within carried ranks. He struck sword one; overthrew another rushing him; sent third his knees, reaching Phil, hit arm heavy blow that, moment, he could use his weapon, gave way got behind his men. "Hurrah!" shouted Mark. "Follow Bevis! Stick Bevis!" "Here I am," said Bill, young giant hitting Varro. "So I," said Fred, giant, slashing Varro side. Varro turned aside defend himself, Mark Antony rushed overturned thump sward. "Hurrah! Down go!" Such tremendous shout arose another direction, Caesar Bevis, Mark, rest, turned fresh victory see companions thrashed. "Over them!" Ted Pompey, Val Crassus, half divided line attacked remainder legion, paused, follow Caesar. Separated Bevis, fought well, struggled hard regain him; and, could keep assailants sword's-length, maintained battle. But Varro's shout, "Keep together! Keep together! Pompey! Keep together!" reminded Ted Phil Varro taught him, and, signing Crassus his men same, he crossed his arms, held his head low, and, Crassus rest, charged, like bulls eyes closed, disregarding savage chops blows he received. The manoeuvre perfectly successful; weight sent right Caesar's men, rolled ground directions. "There!" said Mark, "what I tell you?" "Come on!" shouted Caesar Bevis, he ran assist fallen. He fell Crassus, chanced nearest, violence Val gave way, Bevis left attack Ted. Ted Pompey, nothing loth, lifted his sword stepped meet him. "Bill! Fred!" shouted Mark; three, hustling Caesar Bevis, charged Pompey's sword, he could hit three ways once; and, thump, he measured his length grass. "Cords!--Ropes!" shouted Mark. "Bill--the rope. Hold down, Fred! O! You awful stupe! O!" He stood stock-still, mouth agape; Bevis, pushing Fred aside he going kneel Ted men kneel fallen horse's head, seized Ted arm helped up. "Three one's fair," he said. "Ted, get sword fight _Me_." Ted looked round his sword, rolled yard two. At moment Varro, got his feet again, rushed struck Caesar sharp blow his left arm. He turned, Varro struck again, Fred guarded his sword. Three soldiers, Varro, surrounded Fred Bevis, and, moment, could nothing fence blows. Ted Pompey found his sword, ran aid Varro, Mark hit him: he turned strike Mark, body soldiers, George Tim head, rushed by, fighting others, bore Mark Ted bodily. In second confusion. On sides leaders separated troops, battle spread out, covering forty yards more, twenty individual combats raged once. All green declivity covered scattered parties, one knew better. "Keep together! Keep together!" shouted Varro, he struck rushed fro. "I tell you, keep together! Ted! Ted! Pompey! Keep together!" Swish! slash! clatter! thump! "Hurrah!" "He is down!" "Quick!" "You have got it!" "Take that!" Slash! But slain arose renewed fight. Shrewd Mark Antony knocked his man over, paused higher part slope he chanced be, looked battle. He noted Phil Varro go Pompey urge something. Pompey seemed yield, shouted, "A tail! tail! Crassus! George! Tim! A tail!" Mark dashed slope Bevis, fighting level ground. He hastened save battle, "tail" terrible thing. The leader, must biggest, gets front, next biggest behind him, third behind him, last, forming tail, fact column, long keeps formation bore hole crowd. Before he could get Caesar, many struck passing took time pass fifty yards, tail made--Pompey front, next Val Crassus, Varro, Ike (a big fellow, yet done nothing, good except weight his body), George, Tim, two more. Eight mighty line, began descend slope. "Look!" said Mark Antony last, touching Caesar Bevis, "look there! It is tail!" "It does not matter," said Bevis, looking up. "Does not matter! Why, they will _hunt_ us!" And Pompey hunt them, downright hunt along. Before Fred Bill could come Mark's call, could shake free immediate opponents, Pompey came thundering down, swept everything him. "Out way!" cried Mark. "Bevis, way! O! Now!" He wrung his hands stamped. Bevis stood received charge Pompey led straight him. Pompey, his head arms crossed defend it, ran his might. Bevis, never stirring, lifted his sword. There part Pompey's bare head his arms cover. It temptation, he remembered agreement, he struck his strength Pompey's left arm. So hard blow tough sword snapped, Pompey groaned pain, instant Caesar felt oak mountain fallen him. He hurled ground stunning force, column passed him, one stepping his foot. There he lay half minute, dazed, might easily taken prisoner, could stop rush till gone twenty thirty yards. By time, Mark, Fred, Bill dragged Bevis up, put sword snatched soldier his hand. He limped, looked pale wild minute, his blood up, he wanted renew fight. They would let him, pulled along. "It is use," said Mark; "you cannot. We must get trees. Here, lean me. Run. Sycamores! Sycamores!" he shouted. "Sycamores! trees!" shouted Fred Bill scattered followers. They urged Caesar run, he limped, kept pace somehow. Pompey turned now, went small body Caesar's men, rushed towards saw he down, straws. Still checked column little, floating beams check heavy waves, gave Caesar time get ahead. "Sycamores!" Mark continued shout he ran, broken legions easily understood rally there. At moment battle indeed lost. Pompey ranged triumphant. Leading his irresistible victorious column shouting, he chased flying Caesar. Little Charlie, left ash-tree, could get down, saw whole encounter. The lowest bough high drop from, trunk large clasp slide down. He imprisoned helpless, war sight. He chafed raged shouted, till tears vexation rolled his cheeks. Full fiery spirit torture see battle he could take part. For awhile, watching first shock, he forgot everything else interest fight; presently, combatants separated, strewn slope, he saw easily juncture united body could swept field, remembered Scipio Cecil. Why Cecil come? He looked way, his elevation could see Cecil standing gate Pompey's camp. Having sacked camp, put fire out, thrown coats gate heap field, Scipio know next he ought do, wondered orders reached Caesar. He got highest bar except one gate, could see one, undulations ground completely concealing site conflict. He know do; he waited looked again. Once he fancied he heard shouting, gale strong he could certain. Charlie ash-tree seeing Pompey form tail, column, worked state frenzy. He yelled, he screamed Scipio come, till he hoarse, gasped straining his throat; howling tremendous wind trees gate, prevented Scipio hearing word. Had he known Charlie tree he might guessed something wrong his frantic gestures, he not, many scattered trees field, nothing make look one particular. Charlie waved his hat, last flung air, waved his handkerchief--all vain. He could see crisis, could convey knowledge idle cohort. He looked battle. Caesar trampled foot. He threw his arms, almost lost his balance his excitement. The next minute Caesar up, he his lieutenant flying Pompey. The column chased them, whole scene--the flight pursuit--passed within short distance, half stone's throw ash-tree. Quite wild, lost everything his auger, Charlie next second bough, clinging like cat. He crawled way, till bough bent little his weight. His design get till bowed towards ground, lowered him--a perilous feat! He got half yard further, swung it, out, till branch gave good way. He tried again, looked down; ground still far below. He heard shout, stimulated him. He worked farther, till branch cracked loudly; would break, would bend much farther. His feet hung now; he held his hands. Crack! Another shout! He looked wildly, instant saw little white knob--a button mushroom grass. He left hold, dropped. The little mushroom saved him, guided him, steadied his drop; his feet struck smashed it, his knees giving him, he came. But he hurt, his feet, he hung bowed branch, much nearer earth looked his original perch, he alighted naturally. The shock dazed first, Bevis confused, minutes previously. In minute he right, running his speed towards Scipio. As Caesar ran, shout victorious Pompey close behind, he said, "If could charge column sideways could break it--" "If," snorted Mark, contempt desperation; "if--of course!" Caesar right, he got means then. Next minute reached first sycamore, ten yards front Pompey. As turned face enemy, backs great tree, Pompey lowered his head, crossed his arms, column charged. Nothing could stop onslaught, must crushed them, Bevis, quick thought, pushed Mark Fred one way Bill other, stepping latter. Ted Pompey, his eyes shut, force his men thrusting behind, crashed tree. Down he went recoiling, two three behind him. Thwack! thwack! The four defenders hammered enemies could recover shock. "Quick!" cried Mark; "tie him--prisoner--quick," pulling cord his pocket, putting his foot Ted, lying heap. Before one could help Mark heap heaved up, Val Crassus Phil Varro hauled half-stunned leader back reach. Crash! clatter! bang! thwack! "Backs trees! Stand backs trees!" shouted Bevis, hitting furiously. "We shall win! Here, Bill!" They planted themselves, four, Bevis, Mark, Fred, Bill, backs great trunk sycamore, standing foot two front room swing swords, little way apart reason. The sycamore formed bulwark none could attack rear. The column, recoiled, widened out, came semicircle, surrounding them. "Give in!" shouted Val. "We are ten one!" (that numerically correct.) "Give in! You will prisoners minute!" "That shall not," said Bill, fetching side way slash. "If could get Scipio up," said Mark. "Where he? Cannot get him?" "I forgot him," said Bevis. "There, take that," he warded cut returned it. "I forgot him. Look out, Fred, that is it. Hurrah! Mark," Mark made successful cut. "How stupid." In heat constant changes combat totally forgotten Cecil his cohort. "Why, we have fighting two three," said Bill, "and have not done us yet." "But mean to," said Tim, Bill shrank involuntarily unexpected knock. "Some you--there," shouted Ted Pompey, he came himself, saw number his soldiers rear watching combat. "You,"--in rage,--"you go round behind worry there; get tree hit down." "O! botheration!" said Mark, he heard last order. "We _must_ get Cecil somehow," said Bevis. "Now then," yelled Ted Pompey, stamping terrible fury, "do I tell you; go round tree, `bunt' somebody it!" He passed his hand across his bruised forehead, wiping fragment bark adhered indented skin, rushed fight. Ted fought day like hero; twice severely punished, he returned war increased determination. He nervous lightning, he feared mortal being. He brave brave could be. These heavy knocks seemed touch quick arouse stronger will. When he came combat became tremendous. Like knights backs tree, four received them. The swords crossed rattled, two three minutes nothing else heard; busy shout. The eight column would succeeded better many others pressed get safe knock Bevis, hitting behind bigger ones safety. These impeded Val Phil first line. One struck Bevis. The dust flew his coat, his shoulders smarted, his arms sore, his left arm, he used guard like shield, almost numb knocks. His face grew pale anger. He frowned set his lips tight together, his eyes gleamed. The hail blows descended him, though his wrist began weary, he could repay one-tenth gave him. "Give in! Give in!" shouted Val, front him, he put his left hand Bevis's shoulder. With twist his wrist Bevis hit his right hand sharp knock sword flew it, second Val daunted. "Give in! give in!" shouted Phil, pushing Val's assistance. "You are done! It is good. You cannot help it. Hurrah!" Two soldiers appeared fork tree above. Though huge trunk short, began strike Mark, forced stand far tree he great danger seized, would been, bent Bevis. Bevis breathed hard panted. So thick came hail he could nothing. If he lifted his sword beaten down, he struck, ten knocks came one. He received his punishment silence. Tim cord bind ready: made noose throw, his head. "Stick Bevis," shouted Mark. "Bevis--Bevis--stick Bevis--Fred-- ah!"--a smart knock made grind his teeth, four five assailants rushing separated Caesar. Bevis beaten his knee. He crouched, his left side tree his left hand it, hitting wild savage, still keeping short clear space his sword. "Stop!" cried Val, desisting. "That is enough. Stop! stop! Do not hit him! He is done. We have got him! Now, Phil." Phil Tim rushed noose: Bevis sprang up, drove his head Phil sent whirling Tim under. Bevis made good use moment's breathing time he thus obtained, punishing three his hardest thrashers. "Keep together," shouted Phil he got his knees. "If Ted would I said. Hurrah!" They hammered Bevis sheer dint knocks his knees again. Fred Bill vain tried get him; attacked front rear: Mark quite beside rage, pushed, wrestled, struck, encompassed like bees. Bevis could hit more; he warded well he could, he could return. "Shame! shame!" cried Val, pulling two back, one hand. "Do not hit him! He is down!" "Why does not he give in, then?" said Phil, black thunder. Ted Pompey, watched scene moment without moving, smiled grimly he saw Bevis could hit. "Now," said he, "Phil, Tim, George--Val's soft. Come on--keep close--in go him. Hurrah! Hang it! I say!" "Whoop!" ------------------------------------------------------------------------ End Volume One. Volume Two, Chapter I. THE BATTLE CONTINUED--SCIPIO'S CHARGE. Scipio's cohort rushed clean away sycamore. In mass, Scipio Cecil his men (fetched Charlie), half Caesar's scattered soldiers, rallied Cecil's compact party, rushed right away. Cecil forced his men quiet ran; saw point, sound till close order fell Pompey. Pompey, Val, Phil, whole attacking party swept away like leaves wind. Had seen Scipio coming, heard him, least expected him, would so. But thus suddenly burst rear, helpless, carried away torrent. In second Bevis, Mark, Fred, Bill, found free. Bevis stood breathed again. They came him. "Are hurt?" said Mark. "Not bit," said Bevis, laughing he shook together. "Look there!" Whirled round round irresistible pressure crowd, Pompey his lieutenants hurried away, shouting yelling, unable even strike, closely hemmed in. "They have got eagle," said Mark fury. His standard-bearer overthrown he defended tree, eagle taken him. "Phil's down," said Fred. "So is Tim! And Ike! Hurrah!" "Look little Charlie hitting!" said Bill. "Shout Charlie," said Bevis. "Capital!" "My eagle," said Mark. "Quick," said Bevis suddenly. "Mark--quick; Fred, Bill, these,"--three four soldiers came things looked better--"run quick, Mark, get hollow, know cooked bird, they are going way. See, Ted's beginning fight again, behind him. Make ambush, do not see? Seize he goes by. Quick! I am tired, I will follow minute." Off ran Mark, Fred, Bill, rest, making little circuit, got bowl-like hollow. The crowd Scipio Cecil still thrusting Pompey his men them, Ted worked free main force, he Val Crassus, side side, fighting forced backwards. Step step went backwards, disputing every inch, straight back hollow Mark his party crouching. In half minute Ted would certainly taken. "Victory!" shouted Bevis, ecstasy delight. He leaning sycamore: he stood stepped front see better, shading his eyes (for his hat gone long since) his left hand, point his sword touched ground. He alone, he rejoiced triumph his men. The gale blew his hair back, brushed his cheek. His colour rose, light shone his eyes. "We have won!" he shouted. Just hurricane smote tree, less noise near him, he heard bough crack above. He looked up, thinking might fall; not, he looked back Ted gone. "He is down!" said Bevis. "They have got him." He could see Mark Antony, risen hollow; thus caught two forces, Scipio pushing front, Pompeians broke scattered right straggling line. "Hurrah! But where is Ted? Hurrah!" Bevis absorbed spectacle that, though fight short distance him, impulse join move him. He lost sight. "They are running!" "I have got you!" Ted Pompey pounced behind sycamore-tree; Bevis involuntarily started forward, escaping his clutch, struck, parried, struck again. Pompey, driven backwards step step Scipio, suddenly caught sight Bevis standing alone sycamore. He slipped Scipio, ran round Bevis looked cracking bough, Mark sprang hollow. Scipio's soldiers shouted, seeing Pompey thought running away. Mark moment could understand become him, next he occupied driving Pompeians yielded ground. Pompey running swiftly got round behind tree darted Caesar, whose strategy left alone, intending grasp seize main force. Caesar Bevis slipped breadth half inch. Pompey hit hard, twice, thrice; crash, clatter. His arm strong, sword fell heavy; rattle, crash. He hit his hardest, fearing help would come Bevis. Swish! slash! Thwack! He felt sharp blow his shoulder. Bevis kept off, saw opportunity, cut him. With swords he Ted's match. He Mark often practised become crafty fencing. The harder Ted hit, overbalancing put force blow, less able recover quickly, easier Bevis warded, every three knocks gave Ted rap. Ted danced round him, trying get advantage; he swung his sword fro front horizontally. Bevis retired avoid past sycamore. Finding answer, Ted swung furiously, Bevis retreated, watching his chance, passed several trees narrow breadth level short sward trees quarry. Ted's chest heaved fury his blows; Bevis could ward them, least able strike afterwards. But suddenly, Ted swung still fiercer, Bevis resolutely received sword full his left arm--thud, stopped it. Before Ted could recover Bevis hit his wrist, his sword dropped ground. Ted instantly rushed grappled him. He seized him, sheer strength whirled round round, Bevis's feet touched sward. He squeezed him, tried get across his hip throw him; Bevis his collar, he could it. Bevis got his feet next instant, worked Ted, breathed hard, back. The quarry near, hardly three yards edge cliff; sward beneath feet short sheep fed close verge, yellow lotus flowers. Yonder far waves, saw nothing themselves. The second's pause, Bevis forced Ted back two steps, another, fourth, glared other, over. Ted burst again. He lifted Bevis, could his efforts throw him. He got his feet again. "You punched me!" hissed Ted his teeth. "I did not." "You did." Ted hit doubled fist. Bevis instantly hit back. They struck without much parrying. At this, swords, Bevis's quick eye hand served good stead. He kept Ted back; wrestling Ted's strength superior. Ted got straight-out blow chin; his teeth rattled. He hurled bodily Bevis; Bevis stepped back avoided direct hug, cliff yawned him. Into Ted's mind flashed, vivid picture, something he seen two men fighting road. Without thought, done millionth second, he tripped Bevis. Bevis staggered, swung round, half saved himself, clutched Ted's arm, put his foot back cliff nothing. Ted see his face, Bevis gone. As he fell he disappeared; edge hid him. Crash! Ted's face became leaden pallor, his heart stopped boating; uncontrollable horror seized upon him. Some inarticulate sound came his teeth. He turned fled slope firs, fields, like wind, his home hills. He fled his act. How many done could faced world! Bevis he knew dead. As he ran he muttered himself, constantly repeating it, "His bones smashed; I heard them. His bones smashed." He never stopped till he reached his home. He rushed upstairs, locked his door, got bed his things on. Bevis dead, even injured. He scarcely fallen ten feet he brought flake, stronger kind hurdle. It one originally placed along edge precipice keep cattle falling over. It become loose, horse rubbing sent weeks before. The face cliff cut groove four five feet wide years ago sand-seekers. This groove went straight deep pool water, filled ancient digging stone lower stratum. As flake tumbled presently lodged aslant cutting, position Bevis fell it. His weight drove several feet farther, lower part caught ledge side groove, stopped jerk. The jerk cracked one bar flake, made much like slender gate, sound Ted his agony mind mistook smashing bones. Bevis he struck flake instinctively clutched it, well he so, he would rolled pool. For moment he felt his foot go space, he lost conscious consciousness. He really conscious, he control, will, knowledge time, memory afterwards. That moment passed completely his life, till jerk flake brought himself. He saw pool underneath bars grating, clasped flake still firmer. In position, lying it, he remained minute, getting his breath, recognising he was. Then he rose little, shouted "Mark!" The gale took his voice New Sea, whose waves rolling past twenty yards base cliff. "Mark!" No one answered. He sat upon flake still holding it, began try think he Mark come. His first thought climb somehow, he looked he saw sand straight wall. Steps might cut soft sand, he put his hand his pocket his knife, he reflected steps feet would use unless he something hold well. Then he looked down, inclined moment drop water, would check his fall, bring without injury. Only sides pool steep cliff itself, one swimming could climb get out. He recollected frog he Mark put stone trough, see swam, went round round, could escape. So he he fell pool. He could swim round round his strength failed him. If flake broke, tipped, slipped again, would happen. Bevis sat still, tried think; he he looked New Sea. The sun lower, waves touched purple, crests sprinkled wine. The wind blew even harder, sun got nearer horizon, fine particles sand every carried his head edge precipice. What would Ulysses done? He way getting everything; try he would, Bevis could think plan, especially he feared move much, lest insecure platform give way. He could see his reflection pool beneath, waiting come reality. While he sat quite still, pondering, he thought he heard rumbling sound, supposed noise tramping feet, legions battled above. He shouted again, "Mark! Mark!" immediately wished he done so, lest party fetched Pompey seize him; he captured battle would lost. He know Pompey fled, feared his shout would guide his pursuers, forgetting his excitement he could get them, neither could get him. He kept still looking up, thinking minute he see faces above. But none appeared, suddenly another rumbling noise, directly afterwards sound like scampering, splash underneath him. He looked, sand still rolling sprinkling pool. "A rabbit," thought Bevis. "It rabbit weasel. I see--of course! Yes; rabbit there is ledge, there is ledge I get along." Cautiously he craned his head edge flake, carefully keeping his weight well back he could. There ledge two feet lower flake, narrow, three four inches there; seen many ledges quarry before, he doubt widened. As extreme end, would narrowest there. He thought he could get his foot it, difficulty hold to. It use putting his foot mere strip like unless something his hand grasp. Bevis saw sand-martin pass moment, occurred he could find martin's hole put his hand in, would steady him. He felt round edge groove, when, he extended so, flake tipped little, he drew back hastily. His chest thumped sudden terror, he sat still recover himself. A humble-bee went round edge groove, presently second, buzzing close him, seeing two he remembered one passed before, making three humble-bees. "There must thistles," said Bevis himself, knowing humble-bees fond thistle-flowers, quantities thistles quarry. "If I catch hold thistles, perhaps I it." He wanted feel round perpendicular edge again, feared flake would tip. In half minute he got his pocket-knife, opened largest blade, worked sand farthest edge--in corner--so hold flake like nail. Then utmost caution, feeling every inch his way, he put his hand round edge, moving presently felt thistle. Would hold? next thing; he pull he held it? How could he hold tight, prickles would hurt so. He knew thistles generally deep roots, hard pull up, he thought would firm, besides, one likely several, three four would stronger. Taking his handkerchief, he put his hand it, twisted round his wrist make rough glove, he knelt close sand wall, steadied he started. The flake creaked movements, he hesitated. Should he it, he wait till Mark missed searched? But battle--the battle might lost then, Mark his soldiers driven field, Pompey would triumph, fetch long ladders, take prisoner. Bevis frowned till groove ran centre his forehead, he moved towards verge flake, slowly put his foot till he felt narrow ledge, time searching his hand thistle. Now he his foot ledge, his hand stem thistle; stout, reassured him, prickles came handkerchief. A moment's pause, he sprang round stood upright ledge. His spring broke blade knife, flake upset crashed splash pool. The prickles thistle dug deep his hand, causing exquisite pain. He clung thistle, biting his lips, till he got his foot on. One glance showed his position. The moment he his balance he let go thistle, ran along ledge, widened nine inches foot, tending downwards. Running kept falling, bicycle remains upright motion. In four yards he leapt ledge much broader one, ran along six seven yards, still descending, sprang wide platform, thence six eight feet immense heap loose sand, he sank his knees, struggled slipping he went yielding side, landed his hands knees sward below, still wavelets raised fall flake breaking successive circles sides pool. He moment, stamped his feet alternately shake sand off; he pulled worst thistle points stuck his hand, kicked his heels danced delight. Without looking back he ran narrow bank excavation New Sea, nearest place look round from. The punt inside headland. He saw waves, though much diminished force point, gradually worked nearly shore. He could see nothing battle, remembering place ascent quarry easy, he Mark often run slope, thinly grown grass, he started there, ran up, going get field he recollected he alone, sword, Pompey got party his soldiers, looking him, could easily take prisoner. He determined reconnoitre first, seeing little bramble bush thick growth nettles, peered beside cover. It well he so. Val Crassus, strong body Pompeians, coming sycamores direct towards him. They twenty yards distant Bevis saw them, instantly crouched hands knees brambles. He heard tramp feet, voices. "Where he be?" "Are sure looked firs?" "Quite sure." "Well, he is not firs, behind sycamores, anywhere else, he _must_ quarry," said Crassus. "So I think." "I am sure." "Ted's got somewhere." "Perhaps he is hiding Ted." "Can see quarry?" They crowded edge, looking Bevis excavated hollow beneath. Now Bevis noticed he crouched he put his hand almost mouth wasp's nest, suddenly feeling something tickle back his hand, he moved it, instantly wasp, crawling it, stung him. He pressed his teeth together, shut his eyes endeavour repress exclamation rose; he succeeded, could help low sound his chest. But busy crowding round talking hear it. "I cannot see him." "He is there." "He may hidden behind stone-heaps. There is lot nettles there," said Crassus. "Yes," said another, struck nettles Bevis, cutting three four his sword. "Anyhow," said Crassus, "we are sure him, he cannot get away; Mark's mile time." "Look sharp then; let us go hunt round stone heaps." "There is old oak," said one; "it is hollow; perhaps he is that." "Let us look oak go round get down, behind stones. Are caves?" "I do not know," said Crassus. "Very likely. We will see. March." They moved along left; Bevis opened his eyes, saw sting sheath left sticking his hand. He drew out, waited moment, peered brambles. Crassus cohort going towards old hollow oak, stood far quarry low ground shore New Sea, backs towards him. Bevis stood second try see Mark. There sign him, field quite deserted, he remembered Crassus said Mark mile away. "The battle's lost," said Bevis himself. "Mark fled, Pompey's him, they will minute." He darted slope hollow concealed time, gave chance think. "If I go Plain they will see me," he said himself; "if I ran firs I must cross open first; I hide behind stones, they are coming look. What shall I do? The New Sea's side, I cannot. O!" He bank shore moment. The jutting point rather higher rest ground there, hid minute. He put his left knee punt, pushed hard his right foot. The heavy punt, already loosened waves, yielded, moved, slid sand, floated. He drew his knee on, crept bottom punt, covered two sacks, intended hold sand. He was, too, partly seat, broad. The impetus his push wind waves carried punt out, already fifteen twenty yards land Crassus his men appeared. Volume Two, Chapter II. THE BATTLE CONTINUED--MARK ANTONY. They found oak empty, returning along shore search quarry. The wind brought voices water. "Mind, he will fight he is there." "Pooh! we are ten one." "Well, he hits hard." "And he run. We shall catch find him; he run like hare." "Look!" "The punt's loose." "So is." "Serves old rascal right. Hope sink." "It is sure sink big waves," said Crassus. "Come on," he went quarry, looked behind stone heaps every place could think of, vain. Next one said perhaps even Bevis might sycamores, boughs, went looked, actually pushed soldier one tree see better. After went lower ground searched along nut tree hedge, one side, another, two mound itself. "Wherever _can_ he be?" said Crassus. "It is extraordinary. And Pompey, too." "Both nowhere." "I cannot make out. Thrust sword ferns." So continued hunting hedge. Now way Val Crassus his cohort came hunt Caesar Bevis like this: At moment Pompey pounced Caesar, rest Pompeians, little way off, scattering Mark Antony Scipio Cecil, attacked front rear. Mark Antony, though he (to unaccountably) missed Ted, saw eagle he lost him, and, calling Cecil, pursued fury. So terrific onslaught, especially Scipio's cohort quite fresh, Pompeians gave way ran, knowing general was, believing seen fly combat. This pursuit continued good distance, almost group elms Bevis Mark used run came bath. As Pompeians ran, Val Crassus, driven along throng, caught his foot one tumbled, fell. When he got he found rest gone left behind several stragglers escaped side crowd. As he stood, dubious do, looking round Pompey, several stragglers gathered him, till by-and-by he detachment. Still he uncertain do, whether go Mark endeavour check rout, whether stay rally Pompeians, possible, him. By time fugitives, Antony Scipio hot rear, gone gate hollow way waggon-track led, sight. Val Crassus moved towards rising ground view happened meadows beyond, two Pompeians came running him, said Pompey got Caesar Bevis prisoner. These two hoisted sycamore-tree, Pompey's order, slash four defenders. So long Bevis stood afterwards watching Scipio drive his recent assailants away, dared descend. They seen Bevis fight like paladin; though he alone dared come down. But Pompey pounced him, went fencing other, past tree, distance, slipped tree, large, equally short, half depth fall Charlie had. They dreaded go near two leaders, moment, watched main fight, hesitated go near it, too, friends distress. When turned, Pompey Caesar gone: looked way, Pompeians full flight. They hid minutes bowl-like hollow, moor-cock cooked; ventured peep out, saw Val Crassus, soldiers rallied around him. They ran story Caesar's capture, Ted holding him, could manage it. Val Crassus immediately hastened sycamores, he arrived, found one, Pompey fled, Bevis flake. Val turned angrily two brought intelligence, maintained story, it, added various particulars; Caesar got once, Ted pulled again, that, likely, Bevis got away again, Ted chasing him. Crassus shouted, received answer; he went firs, came back sycamores, next quarry, he stood within yard two Bevis without seeing him. Unable discover either Pompey Bevis, Crassus minutely searching broad mound nut tree hedge. While he thus engaged, Antony Scipio followed close rear fugitives across two meadows, Mark forgetting Bevis his eagerness recover his standard. As ran, presently Phil Varro stopped, sat grass, instantly taken prisoner. He short stout overcome his exertions he could make resistance, tied his hands behind him. Antony still continued pursue, shouting soldier eagle surrender. He so, but, looking back seeing Varro taken, threw down, better escape. So Antony recovered it, last, pausing, found alone, outstripped rest. He returned Varro prisoner, Scipio Cecil came another eagle, he taken, carried Phil Varro. "Hurrah!" shouted Mark, sitting recover breath; rested minute two. "Wreaths!" said Cecil, panting. "Wreaths victors!" "How many made?" "Two three. Hurrah! we will put presently." "Where is Bevis?" said Mark, he got his running. "I have not seen him," said Cecil. "Nor I!" "It is curious." "Have seen him?"--to others. "Not long time." "No--nor Pompey." Every one remarked singular absence two leaders. "Crassus," said Mark. "Bevis hunting Crassus Pompey: that is it. Come on. Let us help. March." He marched along winding hedge-row towards Plain, and, turning round corner, presently came gate nut tree mound Crassus, searching it, opened gate. "Charge!" shouted Mark, dashed Pompeians. Crassus drew back, he could get quite through, Mark jammed gate, gate post. "Fred! Bill!" For Crassus struggled, strong. Bill rushed Mark's assistance: together squeezed Val tight. "O! My side! You dogs!" Crassus hit his sword: pressed harder. "Give in," said Bill. "You are caught--give in." "I shall not," gasped Val. "If I could reach you,"--he hit viciously, inch two beyond his arm. "Charge, Cecil!--Scipio, charge!" shouted Mark. Scipio charged already, Pompeians, divided three parties, one side mound, third it, easily scattered. Scipio found eagle brambles, bearer left it, he jumped hedge run. "Yield," said Bill. "Give in--we have got eagle." "All eagles," said Scipio, returning. "Every one--our two Pompey's two." "And Varro's prisoner--there he is," said Mark. "Give in, Val." "I will not. Let out. Come near hit then. If I could get you!" "But cannot!" "O!"--as pressed him. "Give in!" "No! Not I am squashed:--no, I will not," said Val, frantically struggling. "What is use?" said Scipio. "You may well--the battle's won, it is use fighting." "Where is Pompey?" asked Val Crassus. "Run away," said Mark promptly. "Then where is Bevis?" "After course," said Mark. "I do not believe it; one see Pompey run? Phil, you?"--to prisoner. "Do not know," said Varro, sullenly. "Do not care. If he done I said he would won. Yes, I saw leave fight." "Now give in?" said Mark. "Or must chop till do." "Chop away," said Val defiantly. "Do not hit him," said Scipio. "Val, really it is good, you have lost battle." "I suppose have," said Val. "Well, let one take Varro hill, let tell he see Pompey anywhere." They so. Cecil three others guards took Varro rising ground; Varro obliged Pompey sight. "Take then," said Crassus, hurling his sword them. "Well, I never thought Ted would run. If he not, I would given fifty you." "But he run," said Mark, unable suppress his joy. "You will not tie me," said Crassus, let out. Mark tie him, ten one loosened Varro too. Mark led higher ground towards sycamores, fully expecting see Bevis every moment. When he got there, could see anywhere, he could understand it. Then Crassus told search he made. Mark went quarry looked down--no one there. He halted two his men ran firs shouting, course came back unsuccessful. "I know," said Scipio, "he is gone camp." "Of course," said Mark. "How stupid us--of course he is camp. Let see us come properly. Two two, now--prisoners two two half-way down, that is it. Eagles front. Right. March." He marched, Scipio beside him, four eagles behind, prisoners centre. Never prouder general Mark moment. He captured enemy's eagles, recovered his own, taken Pompey's lieutenants captive. Pompey his soldiers fled: looking round Plain one sight. Mark Antony sole possession battlefield. Proudly he marched, passing every broken swords ground, noticing trampled grass fierce combats occurred. How delighted Bevis would see him! How he looked forward Bevis's triumph! All his heart full Bevis, his success, Bevis's victory he rejoiced in. "Bevis! Bevis!" he shouted, came near camp, answer. When entered camp, found fire still smouldering, Bevis, Mark's face became troubled. The triumph faded away, he grew anxious. "Where ever he be?" he said. "I hope there is nothing wrong. Bevis!" shouting top his voice. The gale took shout it, nothing came roaring wind. The sun sinking cast purple gleam grass. Volume Two, Chapter III. BEVIS IN THE STORM. In punt Bevis remained quite still sacks Crassus searched quarry him, looked sycamores, afterwards went hazel hedge. Bevis, peeping broad seat, saw go there, knew he could see New Sea lower ground, others might moment come hill, he considered best keep bottom boat. The punt first floated slowly, sheltered jutting point, still flow water carried out, little time wind pushed strongly got farther shore. Presently began roll waves, Bevis soon found inconveniences flat-bottomed vessel. The old punt always leaked, puntsman idle bale till compelled, space veal false bottom full water. As she began roll water went sound like "swish" side side, Bevis saw appear edge boards side. When she drifted quite gulf met full force waves every time lifted her, bilgewater rushed floor. Bevis obliged change his position, else he would soon wet through. He doubled two sacks sat them, reclining his arms seat still low much concealed possible. This precaution really needless, armies scattered, one pursuing pursued, places could see him, even moved shore would never thought looking he was. He could know this, sat sacks. The punt centre storm, waves seemed immense Bevis. Between surface dark, tops crested foam, wind blew him, he look direction he going back escape constant shower scud his face. Now up, down, boat heaved sank, turning slowly round she went, generally broadside on. With hurricane waves she floated fast, shore already far behind. When Bevis felt he really New Sea wild delight possessed him. He shouted sang how-- "Estmere threw his harpe asyde, And swith he drew his brand!" The dash waves, "wish" gust struck him, flying foam, fury storm, red sun almost level horizon towards he drifted, dark heaving waters wrath lifted his spirit meet them. All he wished Mark share pleasure. He broadest part New Sea rollers come far rose yet higher. Bevis shouted them, wild waves. The punt cumbrous heavy rise buoyantly waves went under, hung them, crests larger waves frequently broke gunwale poured flood water board. There crevices her sides, ordinary times noticed, she never loaded deep enough bring water-line. But waves rising found chinks, rushed narrow streams. The increase water punt forced Bevis move, he sat seat his feet sacks. The water quite three inches false bottom, rushed side side great splash, course helping heel her over. Bevis like all; he ceased singing, looked him. It seemed mile (it far) back quarry, waste raging waves foam! On either side shore long, long way, he could swim tenth far. He recognised sedges he Mark wandered his left, found he rapidly coming near two islands. He began grow anxious, thinking boat would keep afloat much longer. The shore front beyond islands great way, he knew he believed encumbered far weeds which, punt foundered, he could swim, his hope she would strike either Unknown Island Serendib. Both near, he tried discover whether current wind would throw them. A long white streak parallel course storm marked surface water rising falling waves like ribbon, seemed pass close Serendib. The punt nearly streak he hoped he get there. If he something row with! The Old Man Sea hidden sculls, troubled bring movable seat him, he want it. The movable seat would made good paddle. As stretcher fixed, nailed floor. He could nothing paddling his hand, calm weather he might, storm wind. If he something paddle he could worked punt line strike Serendib. As he could nothing; he his hat he could baled water, continued rise higher. Drifting waves chose he saw Serendib low, flat island. The Unknown Island rose steep sand bluff end faced him. Against bluff waves broke tremendous fury, sending spray bushes top. Bevis watched see punt would ground, whether would miss islands drift narrow channel them. He still thought might hit Serendib, rotated, brought position waves must take crash low steep cliff Unknown Island. Bevis set his teeth, prepared dig his nails sand, punt within three waves shore, seemed pause. This reflux--the undertow, water recoiling bank--so boat half moment suspended held two forces. Before he time think best punt partly swung round, rush current, setting islands, carried along close beside shore. The bluff sloped, waves rushed among bushes trees. Bevis watched, saw chance, instant stepped seat, leaped his might. It long way, he good jumper, his feet landed ground. He would even fallen back water he grasped branch alder. For moment he hung waves, next he drew up, safe. He stepped back edge, instinctively put his left arm round alder trunk, clinging friend. Leaning tree he saw punt, pushed impetus his spring, swing round drift rapidly islands. It went distance, began settle, slowly sank. Bevis remained holding tree till he recovered himself, he moved farther island, went little way bluff, whence he saw sun set. He soon forgot his alarm, subsided began enjoy his position. "What pity Mark me!" he said himself. "I sorry. Only think, I am really shipwrecked. It is splendid!" He kicked his heels, startled blackbird flew bramble bush across water. Bevis watched fly aslant gale till he lost sight trees shore. Looking way--north-west--his quick eyes found curious thing. On side island broad band weeds stretching towards shore, widening farther extended. These weeds level surface, waves rolled undulated like loose green carpet lifted strong draught. As proceeded undulations became less less, till emerging open channel side weeds, nothing slow ripples. Still passing slow ripples gently crossed, lost second band weeds. He could hear boom waves struck low cliff dashed pieces, yet furious waves subdued leaves stalks weeds, he knew he could pull his hand. Watching green undulations he looked farther saw distance island banks covered sedges, channel weeds (showing deeper water) wound among these. Next he went top cliff, found young oak-tree growing summit, he held thus exposed full strength wind, every spray flew sprinkled him. Shading his eyes his hand, wind seemed hurt them, he looked towards quarry, appeared yellow distance. He saw group people, he supposed Pompey's victorious army, passing sycamores. "It is use, Ted," he said himself, "you cannot find me, cannot win. I have done you." The group really Mark rest searching him. After went hill, Bevis could see them. Bevis came cliff, thought he would see large island was, he went round it, near edge he could. It covered wood, thickest masses bramble he ever seen. He find way round these, took time get along. Some firs obstructed his path, he found one tall spruce. At last he reached extremity, ground low, water, nearly smooth there, sheltered projecting irregularities shore. Returning he one place climb quantities stones, bank steeper, presently compelled go inland. The island seemed large, shape narrow long, thickly overgrown bushes trees he could see across it. The surface uneven, he went hollow seemed beneath level water, afterwards came steep bank, rounding he close place he started. Not anything eat since dinner (for shirked tea), gone labours, Bevis began feel hungry, nothing eat his island, berries yet ripe. First he whistled, he wished Mark would come, he walked cliff climbed oak summit. "Mark sure come," he said himself. Just he saw full moon, risen distant hills, shining battlefield touched raging waves tarnished silver. He looked great round shield heraldic markings dimmed gleam. He almost fancied he could see move, rapidly sweep upwards. It clear bright wind-swept, hurricane brushed it. Bevis watched little while, he thought Mark. The possibility Mark would know he never entered his mind, occur perhaps even Mark would hesitate venture tempest wind: strong his faith his companion. The wind blew hard tree, he presently got down, descended slope till ridge sheltered him. He sat rough grass, put his hands his pockets, whistled assure he liked it. But he hungry, time seemed slow, he could quite suppress inward feeling shipwreck one quite alone altogether splendid. It dull. He got up, picked stones, threw shadowy bushes, something do. They fell crash, one two birds fluttered away. He wished he his knife cut whittle stick. He thought he would make his mind go sleep, extended ground, when, looking he lay his back, he saw stars. Not least sleepy, he jumped again. "Kaack! kaack!" like immensely exaggerated prolonged "quack" without "qu;" harsh shriek resounding water even gale. "A heron," thought Bevis. "If I gun, bow now." He took stone, peered water side cry came from, weeds were. The surface dim shadowy direction, he could see heron. He returned sat grass. He could think anything do, till last he resolved build hut branches, shipwrecked people did. But he came pull alder branches, size tough; aspen high up; firs small. "Stupid," he said himself. "This _is_ stupid." Once he returned foot slope, sat grass. Before shadowy trees bushes, behind he could hear boom waves, yet never occurred weird place was. All he wanted something. "Why ever does not Mark come?" he repeated himself. Just he chanced put his hand his jacket-pocket, instantly jumped delighted. "Matches!" He took box, he used light camp-fire, immediately set gathering materials fire. "The proper thing do," he thought. "The thing!" He soon began make pile dead wood, he stopped, and, lifting bundle his arms, carried slope nearly top cliff, he put behind bramble bush. He thought he made fire height would guide Mark, hollow one could see it. To get together enough sticks took time; moon, though full bright gave light beams fell direct. In shadow he could hardly see all. Having arranged pile, put larger sticks one side, ready throw presently, he put dry leaves grass underneath, he straw paper, struck match held, them. Some leaves smouldered, one crackled, dry grass lit little, contact flame match. The thing happened ten matches, one other. The flame would spread. Bevis his knees thought good while, he set work gathered leaves, dry grass, thin chips dry bark. Then he took sliding-drawer match-box, placed these, deal made would burn like paper. The outer case he careful preserve, safety matches, lit prepared surface. In around little drawer he arranged half-a-dozen matches, lit them, putting rest his pocket. The flame caught deal, thin wafer, bark tiny twigs, dry grass larger sticks. It crept pile, crackling hissing. In three minutes hold boughs, curling lambent point round them, cow licks grass her tongue. The bramble bush sheltered gale, let enough wind draught. Up sprang flames, bonfire began cast heat, red light flickering trees. Bevis threw branches, fire flared gleamed afar wet green carpet undulating weeds. He hauled fallen pole, sparks rose he hurled on. "Hurrah!" shouted Bevis, dancing singing: "Kyng Estmere threwe his harpe asyde, And swith he drew his brand; And Estmere he, Adler yonge, Right stiffe stour stand!" "Adler minute." He meant Mark. Volume Two, Chapter IV. MARK IS PUT IN PRISON. But Adler trouble. After waited time camp, thinking Bevis would certain return sooner later, finding he come, whole party, Mark head, searched re-searched battlefield adjacent meadows, overlooking copse. Mark next ran home, hoping Bevis reason might gone there, asked whether he offended way, he left fight? But he could recollect he done anything. Bevis, course, home, Mark returned battlefield, every minute adding his anxiety. It unlike Bevis he felt sure something must wrong. "Perhaps he is drowned," said Val. "Drowned," repeated Mark, intense contempt; "why he swim fifty yards." Fifty yards far, would far enough save life many occasions. Val silenced, still Mark, certain, went along shore, even way Nile. By others left, one time, Val, Cecil, Charlie remained. The four hunted again, walked slowly across field, trying think. Mark picked Bevis's hat, fallen battle; find Bevis's hat nothing, he knack leaving behind him. "Perhaps he is gone place," said Charlie, meaning Mark's home. Mark shook his head. "But I wish would go see," he said; he dared face Frances. "So I will," said Charlie, always ready his best, he went. Charlie's idea gave rise another, Bevis might gone Jack's home Downs, Val offered go inquire, though long, long walk. He set out, Cecil went him, Mark, left himself, walked slowly home, hoping Bevis might returned. As he came Bevis's hat his hand, servants pounced upon him. Bevis missed, great outcry, people inquiring him. Several come kitchen gossip it. The uproar would great soon got battle. "You said picnic," said Polly, shaking Mark. "You told I so," said Bailiff, seizing his collar. "Let go," shouted Mark, punching. "Well, done him? Where he?" Mark could tell, them, four five one, hustled cellar. "You must go gaol," said Bailiff grimly. "Bide bit." "How find Bevis without me!" shouted Mark, admitted he know Bevis was. But Bailiff pushed stumbling three stone steps, he heard bolt grate staple. Thus general great battle thrust ignominiously cellar. Mark kicked banged door, solid oak, without much panel weaken it, though resounded even shake. He yelled till he hoarse, hit door till his fists became numbed. Then suddenly he sat quite quiet stone steps, tears came his eyes. He care cellar, Bevis--Bevis lost somewhere wanted him, he _must_ go Bevis. Dashing tears away, he jumped, looked round see he could find anything burst door open. There one window, deep set thick wall, iron upright bar inside. The glass yellowish-green, small panes, covered cobwebs, light dim. He could see barrels, large small, his eyes became accustomed semi-darkness meat--a joint-- vegetables shelf, placed coolness. Out came his pocket-knife, he attacked joint savagely, slashing slices anyhow, he (like Bevis) hungry, angry he care he did. As he ate he still looked round round cellar peered corners, saw nothing, though something moved shadow floor, doubt resident toad. Mark knew cellar perfectly, he often seen tools it, hammer, used tapping barrels, though he tried hard he could find it. It must taken away purpose. He stamped stone floor, heard rustle startled mouse rushed hole. The light seemed increase, turning towards window he saw full round moon. As crossed narrow window shadow iron bar fell opposite wall, moved aside, minutes moon began disappear she swept sky. He watched bright shield still awhile, he looked he thought iron bar, came his knife again. The bar let stonework, window recess inside encased wood, bar, flattened end, fastened three screws. Mark endeavoured unscrew these, he quickly broke point his knife, soon nothing stump left. The stump answered better complete blade, he presently got screws out. He worked bar fro violence he wrenched top screws clean away wood there. But he lifted bar smash panes get out, he saw frame far narrow pass through. Inside recess wide enough, half broad glass was. The bar really unnecessary; one could got out, perhaps insecurely fastened, workmen could hardly helped seeing needless. Mark hurled bar end cellar, knocked plaster wall, fell earthenware vessel used keep vegetables in, cracked it. He stamped cellar, his bitter desperate anger, half mind set taps running spite. "Let out," he yelled, thumping door his might. "Let out; you have business put here. If governor home, I know he would not, you are beasts--you are _beasts_." He right far governor would locked cellar; governor evening, Bevis's mamma, soon she found he missing, horse put dog-cart, went fetch him. So Mark fell hands merciless. No one even heard howling bawling kicking heart oak, he exhausted he sat wooden frame made support cask. Presently he went door more, shouted keyhole, "Tell found Bevis!" There answer. He waited, sat frame, asked he could get roof. By standing top largest cask he thought he could touch rafters, more, he tool cut his way with. "I know," he said suddenly, "I will smash lock." He searched iron bar, found earthenware vessel. He hit lock tremendous bang, stopped, began examine carefully. His eyes used dim light, he could see almost well day, he found great bolt lock, quite three inches thick, shot open staple driven door-post, staple much like used fasten chains to. In minute he end iron bar inside staple. The staple strong, driven deep oaken post, he great leverage it. The bar bent, staple came slowly, easier, presently fell stones. The door immediately swung open towards him. Mark dashed bar his hand, fully determined knock one got his way, road, he reached meadow. He dropped bar, ran battlefield. Going gate opened New Sea, something pushed beside his ankles. It would startled him, he saw directly Pan. The spaniel followed him: may intelligence he looking his master. "Pan! Pan!" said Mark, stooping stroke him, delighted get sympathy last. "Come on." Together raced battlefield. Then high ground Mark saw beacon island, instantly knew Bevis. He never doubted moment. He looked beacon, saw flames shoot up, sink, rise again; he ran back fast he could head water, boats moored sandy corner. Fetching sculls tumbling she would kept, he pushed blue boat fitting sailing, never dreaming first voyage would like this. Pan jumped him. In his haste, looking he going, he rowed weeds, time getting out, stalks clung blade scull invisible creature water holding it. Soon he got free he reached waves, five minutes, coming open channel, boat began dance down. With wind wave oar he drove along rapid pace, past oak council held, past jutting point, broad waters, he could see beacon, he glanced his shoulder. The boat pitched furiously, seemed rising almost straight up, dipping she would dive deep. But she always rose again, her came wave she surmounted rolling hiss bubble eager overtake him. The crest blew like shower his face, following roller seemed break stern-sheets sank. Still wave always came him, row hard he would, like vengeance, black, dire, sleepless. Lit full moon, raging waters rushed foamed gleamed around him. Though he afterwards saw tempests ocean, waves never seemed high threatening night, alone little boat. The storms, indeed, inland waters full dangers, perhaps long heaving billows sea, waves seem scarcely interval between, racing quick, short steep, one other. This great black wave--for looked always same--chased eagerly, overhanging stern. Pan sat bottom looked wave. Mark rowed his hardest, trying get away it. Hissing, foaming, rush roar wind, wave ran after. When he ventured look round he close islands, quickly he travelled. Bevis standing summit cliff long stick burning end his hand. He held straight like arm signal, waved little, kept pointing direction. He shouting his loudest, direct Mark, could hear sound, easily guessed he meant bear way he pointed. Mark pulled strokes looked again, saw white spray rushing cliff, though he could hear noise surge. Bevis frantically waving burning brand; Mark understood now, pulled his left scull, hardest. The next minute current setting islands seized boat, he carried mountain torrent. Everything seemed whirl past, he saw black wave followed dashed sparkling fragments cliff. He taken beyond island he could stay boat, he edged away rush behind land, water much smoother, able presently row back shelter. Bevis came trees meet him, taking hold stem boat drew ashore. Mark stepped out, Pan, jumping Bevis, barked round him. Bevis told happened, danced delight he heard Mark battle, he insisted Mark done it. They went beacon fire, Mark, his first joy over, began grumble Bevis really shipwrecked he not. He wished he smashed his boat cliff now. Bevis said could another great shipwreck soon. Mark wanted stop night island, Bevis hungry. "And besides," said he, "there is governor; he awfully frightened us, he ought know." "So he did," said Mark. "Very well; but, mind, jolly shipwreck." Scamps were, disliked give pain loved them. It knowledge governor would never put cellar stopped Mark spiteful trick turning taps. Bevis exceedingly angry Mark locked up. He stamped his foot, said Bailiff know. They got boat, took scull, afloat paused, occurred could row back teeth storm. "We shall stop island now," said Mark, sorry. Bevis, however, remembered floating breakwater weeds, winding channel side, told Mark it. So rowed weeds, much waves weakened boat barely rocked. Now boat steady, Pan sat front, peered stem like figure-head. Presently came sand mudbanks water quite smooth, heron rose up. "We ought gun," said Bevis; "it is shame have not got gun." "Just did not know shoot," said Mark indignantly. "Just if," echoed Bevis; "but one, somehow." The boat he spoke grounded shallow; got her off, she soon grounded again, took quite three-quarters hour find channel, much turn wind. At last stopped thick masses weeds, great bunch reed-mace, often called bulrushes, decided land sandbank. They hauled boat far shore she could possibly get loose, walked mainland. There bushes bramble thickets gave much trouble, contrived get wildest-looking field seen. It covered hawthorn-trees, bunches thistles, bramble bushes, rushes, numbers green ant-hills, almost high knees. Skirting this, wound ant-hills, startled peewits, rose curious whistle, two three white tails, knew rabbits, disappeared round thistles. It took time cross field; next barley, short; next wheat, clover; last reached head water, got meadows. Thence short way home, could see house illuminated moonlight. The authorities wroth, though secretly glad see them. Nothing said; wrath deep reproaches. They ordered bed instant. They dare disobey, Mark darted savage look, Bevis shouted back top staircase he hungry. "Be off, sir," reply. Sullenly went room sat down. Five minutes afterwards one opened door little way, put plate jug, went away. On plate three huge slices bread, jug cold water. "I will not touch it," said Bevis; "it is hateful." "It is hateful," said Mark. "After came home tell them, too," said Bevis. "Horrid!" But by-and-by his hunger overcame him; he ate two huge slices, Mark other. Then draught cold water, undressed, fell asleep, quick calm, Aurora beginning show her white foot East. Volume Two, Chapter V. IN DISGRACE--VISIT TO JACK'S. "As dogs," said Bevis indignantly. "Just if," said Mark. "It is hateful. And coming home island tell them." "All trouble." "I could brought stuff eat," said Mark, "and could stopped night, quite jolly." "Hateful!" They blue-painted summer-house next day talking conduct authorities, whose manner distant extreme. The governor angry. They thought unjust winning mighty victory, actually coming home purpose save alarm. "I like all," said Bevis. "Let us go back island," said Mark eagerly. "They would come look us first thing," said Bevis. "I have great mind walk Southampton, see ships. It is sixty miles." "Well, come on," said Mark, quite ready, "The road goes hills Jack's. O! I know!" "What it?" Mark jumped up. "Jack's got rifle," said Mark. "He will lot us shoot. Let us go stop Jack." "First-rate," said Bevis. "But know he rifle? There was not one I last--you mean long gun." "No, I do not; he is got rifle. I know, he told Frances. He tells Frances everything. Stupids always tell girls everything. Somebody wanted sell it, he bought it." "Are quite sure?" said Bevis, getting up. "Quite." "What sort it?" "A deer rifle." "Come on." Off started without another word, walked mile great hurry, recollected appear evening would hunt them. "Just babies," said Mark. "Such rubbish," said Bevis. "But will not stuff nonsense. Let us find Charlie, send back message." They found him, sent home piece paper, Bevis wrote, "We gone Jack's, shall home to-night." It quite hour's walk Jack's, whose house narrow valley two hills. Jack away fields, he returned he showed rifle, small, old-fashioned muzzle-loader, spent long time handling it, examining smallest detail. "Let us shot," said Bevis. "Yes," said Mark. "Now do, Jack." They begged teased worried him, till he almost yielded. He thought perhaps Bevis's governor would like shooting, hand he knew Frances fond Bevis, Mark her brother, whom, various reasons, he wished keep especially friendly. At last he said would go try shoot young rabbit, took his double-barrel. They take dogs, meaning stalk rabbits shoot sitting, neither Mark Bevis could kill anything moving. Jack went little enclosed meadows foot Downs rabbits came sun began sink. Every he made wait he crept forward peered gaps gates. Presently he came quietly back gap hollow willow, giving Bevis gun (which he hitherto carried himself, anxious lest accident happen), whispered three young rabbits grass. "Aim shoulder," said Jack, thinking Bevis might miss head. "And sure do not pull triggers once, and--I say--" But Bevis started. Bevis stepped noiselessly squirrel, glancing carefully round willow saw rabbits' ears pricked grass. They heard seen him, young much frightened, soon resumed feeding. He lifted gun, somewhat heavy, converted muzzle-loader, old guns made heavier custom now. One rabbits moving turned his back him, he could see shoulder; behind bunch grass; minute third moved, Bevis aimed him. The barrels would first keep quite steady, sight, he got rabbit, jumped aside drooped, he try twice he satisfied. "What time he is," whispered Mark, Bevis pulled trigger, ran forward. Jack jumped gap picked rabbit, kicking grass. Bevis rubbed his shoulder felt his collar-bone. "Hurt?" said Jack, laughing. "Kicked? I going tell hurry. You held stock tight shoulder, would kick. There, like this; try." Bevis took gun pressed firm his bruised shoulder. "Got tight?" said Jack. "Aim thistle, try again." "But he will frighten rabbits, it is turn," said Mark. "All gone in," said Jack, "every one; you will wait till come again. Shoot." Bevis shot, thistle shattered. It scarcely hurt all, would done least, his shoulder tender now. "It is little rabbit," said Mark. "That it is not," said Bevis. "How dare say so?" "It looks little." "The size kitten," said Jack. "As sweet chicken," he added, "when cooked, white. You shall to-morrow dinner-- right size nice;" he saw Bevis rather inclined doubtful, wished reassure him. Jack huge, kind-hearted giant. "Are sure nice?" "The thing," said Jack, "if Mark shoot another like it; wants two pudding." About half hour afterwards Mark shoot another, long discussion biggest, could decided, for, fact, age, one could hardly distinguished other, except Mark's shot-hole ear, Bevis's not. On way home cloud sparrows rose wheat settled hedge, Bevis shot these, bringing three. Afterwards he missed yellow-hammer sat singing happily gate. He wanted yellow-hammer fine colour. The yellow-hammer sang away he aimed, repeating note, he perched heap, little lump feathers top bar. The instant flash came bird flew, habit starting drooped, shielded top bar. The bar scarred shot, dozen pellets buried it; yellow-hammer hurt. Mark delighted Bevis missed. There elm near garden, Mark, look-out anything, spied young thrush. He took steady aim, came thrush. They disposed debate shot, best, Jack stopped it, brought quoits. After played time, growing dusky, Ted entered field. "Halloa! Pompey," said Mark. "Pompey!" "Pompey," said Jack, understanding. Ted walked straight Bevis. "Where go," said Bevis, "after I fell over?" "But are not angry?" said Ted. "Angry--why?" "Because I sent over." "But did not purposely." "No, _that_ I did not," said Ted, his might. From moment better friends ever before, though time Ted could really believe Bevis angry it. In fact, idea never entered Bevis's mind. Ted stopped supper, everything explained Jack, delighted battle, could hear enough it. But press Ted become him, seeing confused he whenever subject approached. Quite beside terror misery, poor Ted pretended illness remained his room, refusing see one, dreading every footstep every knock door, lest constable come arrest him. Towards afternoon Val, already Bevis's house found he right, strolled see Pompey. Ted would open door even him, Val taunted coward time battle. Still, Ted would unlock till Val happened say row war, Bevis gone Jack's. Open came door directly. "Where is Bevis?" said Ted, grasping Val's arm. "At Jack's." "Not killed?" "Killed--no. How could he killed?" As soon he understood Bevis really alive, even hurt, Ted started off, Val's amazement, never stopped till he entered field picking quoits grew dark play well. So Caesar Pompey sat supper lovingly, talked Pharsalia. Big Jack made tell story again, wished he could taken part combat. Like Mark, too, he envied Bevis's real shipwreck. Now seeing Jack interested made use his good-humour, coaxed till last he promised let shoot rifle morrow evening, he finished fields. All next day rambled place, garden, orchard, rick-yard stables, back house, lumber-room top see could find anything; larder, Jack's dear old mother her best surfeit cakes wines, good things she could think of, reminded her Jack he boy and, sense, manageable. As Jack's old father, old, he sat parlour almost day long, grim anybody approach. He sat his high hat on, aslant his head, he wanted anything knocked table floor chance directed thick stick. When he walked out, every one slipped aside avoided him, hiding behind ricks, Jack's pointer slunk his house, drooping his tail. In orchard Bevis Mark squailed pears short sticks. If hit one bruised side blow; fell another good bump; well-known thumping makes pears juicy. Tired walked mill-pool, small trout, Jack's especial pets. The water clear could see bottom pool distance; looked different New Sea valley. "We ought water water-barrel go voyage," said Bevis. "It is clearer Nile." "The water-barrel must got ashore somehow shipwreck," said Mark, "or perhaps shall drink." They rather inclined swim pool, know Jack would like it, he jealous his trout, angry disturbed. They would swim though same, miller looking hatch his door. There he stood white floury, blinking his eyes, watching them. "How anybody stupid stand stock still, stare, stare, stare, I cannot think," said Mark, quite loud enough miller hear. He smile stir; he even understand he meant; sidelong speech beyond his comprehension. It would needed severe abuse indeed, hurled straight his head, made much lift his hand dust flour his sleeve--the first thing he he began feel little. Next went indoors look guns rifle rack, dared touch. Hearing quick clatter hoofs ran out, saw labourer riding pony bare back. He sent village two miles away domestic requirement, carried parcel his arm, his heels escaped scraping ground. The pony came sharp he could, knowing his stable. But sooner labourer off, Bevis up, forced go round pasture house. When Bevis wearied, Mark mounted, turns rode pony round round field, making leap broad furrow, gallop his hardest. By-and-by, Bevis got Mark put his hand he sprang up, pony gave snort bolted, throwing his heels he flew his stable. Such experience new him, he time he quite understood; soon he did, found hands he fallen, pony made use first opportunity. They followed, he showed his heels viciously thought best let alone; hurling sticks thrashed round field his head, turned away. After dinner took another game. This sliding steep behind house, short piece broad plank ridge front. The way lie chest plank head first, trailing toes behind, legs extended rudders keep course straight. A push feet starts board, pace increasing, presently travel furious velocity. Nothing nicer. They worked hours. The old gentleman came garden watched them, doubt remembering he used himself; performers, thought would like squail stick his high ancient hat aslant his head. Presently rambled nut copse hill. The nuts ripe, nothing much done there, copse, copses always pleasant search in. Mark returned sliding, Bevis sat summit, first looked on, he became lost his dreamy mood. Far away blue-tinted valley went horizon, sun suspended like lamp hung ceiling, seemed higher hill he sat. Underneath house, round tiled gables swallows busy going fro nests. The dovecot great barn, red apples orchard, mill-pool grey mill, he could almost put his hand them. Beyond came meads, trees closed together like troops bugle call, making limitless forest, narrow bright gleam, like crooked reaping-hook thrown down. It New Sea. After definition, surface only, fainter fainter place white clouds went door distance disappeared. He see these, knew wheat his back rustled light wind came over. It vast aerial space, golden circle sun. He think, he felt, listened it. Mark shouted presently Jack coming home; he ran down, went meet him. Jack put target tea. It square rusty sheet-iron, he drew circle chalk six inches diameter, outside another two feet. This he placed steep hill--the best butts--keeping upright two stakes, he drove sward. He measured hundred yards stepping, put three flints row mark spot. The rifle loaded bullet rammed home iron ramrod, round smooth handle end, might force lead grooves. Jack fired, missed; fired again, missed; shot third time longer aim, still ringing sound jagged hole sheet-iron. Bevis tried, Mark tried, Jack again, could hit it. More powder used, less powder; bullet jammed home hard knocking ramrod fragment post (the first thing came handy), pushed powder. All vain. The noise reports brought together number labourers cottage boys, sat summit hill row. They fired standing up, kneeling down, lying full length. A chair fetched, barrel placed rung back rest, single hole made target. Mark wanted go nearer try fifty yards, Jack would not; rifle made kill deer hundred yards, hundred yards he intended use it. He getting angry, he prided his shooting, fact good shot double-barrel; little rifle--a mere toy--defied him; he could manage it. They fired thirty forty shots, till every bullet ready cast gone. The earth scored target, cut front it, ploughed right left, drilled high up, broad sheet-iron untouched. Jack threatened pitch rifle mill-pool, disgusted he likely he would done Bevis Mark begged earnestly so. He put rack, went off, see till supper-time. He much temper possible be. When went bedroom night, Bevis Mark talked over, fully agreed rifle could it. "I am sure could," said Bevis. "Of course could," said Mark. "There is something find out." "As easy nothing," said Bevis. Volume Two, Chapter VI. SAILING. At Bevis's home authorities still wroth received scrap paper sent Charlie, scampered he could questioned. There wrath battle previous misdeeds, principally something novel. No one hurt, one even much knock, except larger boys, could stand it. There rattling weapons together wounds. Ted's forehead bruised, Bevis's ankle tender one stepped he down. This nothing bruises often football. The fall quarry indeed might serious, sinking punt; extrinsic matters, might fought twenty Pharsalias without incidents. All good sense enough adhere agreement come fighting. They could anyhow hurt commonly football, authorities perhaps little bitter it. If known going on, explained, kept secret, anxiety Bevis lost might great, would much trouble. But Bevis Mark deep disgrace. As going away might go stay away wished. For first day, indeed, quite relief, house quiet peaceful; like new life altogether. It would good plan despatch rebels distance, would fully employed, supervision. How peaceful would be! The governor Bevis's mother thought strain removed live fully ten years longer. But next day somehow seem pleasant. There sense emptiness house. The rooms vacant, occasional voices sounded hollow. No one chattered breakfast. At dinner-time Pan called might company, stillness could hear ring, ring blacksmith's hammer his anvil. When Bevis home could never hear that. The governor rode afternoon, Bevis's mother thought tormentors absent would good time sit calmly needlework. Every five minutes she got looked window. Who banged outer gate? Was Bevis? The familiar patter steps flags, confused murmur came follow. It John Young gone road. The clock ticked loud, Pan snored armchair, looked her reproachfully she woke him. By-and-by she went upstairs bedroom. The bed made, one slept it. There gimlet dressing-table, Bevis's purse floor, half-sovereign it. A great tome, ancient encyclopaedia, Bevis dragged upstairs, lying chair, open "Magic." Mark's pocket-knife stuck bed-post, his best hat three corn-crake's eggs, blown, course, put safety, he never wore it. She went window, swallows came nests eaves. Bevis's jackets things lying everywhere, she left room she saw curious mark threshold, angles points. He trying draw wizard's foot there, inking five angles, keep evil spirits witches, according proper way, lest take magician surprise. Next she went bench-room--their armoury--and lifted latch, locked, key Bevis's pocket. The door rattled hollow. She looked keyhole, could see crossbow rigging ship. Downstairs again, sitting her needlework, she heard carrier's van go by, marking time four. There booing distant cows, fly buzzed pane. She took her thimble looked old Pan armchair--old Pan, Bevis's friend. It deadly quiet. No shout, bang, clatter upstairs. No loud "I must," "I will." No rushing room, upsetting chairs, twisting tables askew. No "Ma, where is hammer?" "Ma, where is bow?" "Ma, where is hat?" She rang bell, told Polly go ask Frances come take tea her, she quite alone. Frances came, talk Bevis, Mark, big Jack. So soon she heard battle Frances immediately took part, thought ingenious Bevis contrive it, brave fight desperately. Then mamma discovered good Mark, affectionate, brave row water storm fetch Bevis island. When governor returned, his surprise, he found two ladies confronting reasons Bevis Mark heroes instead scamps. He agree, use; course he yield, result dog-cart sent following morning. But Bevis least hurry return, bit. He disposed, contrary, disobey, remain he was. Mark persuaded this, still he kept dog-cart waiting several hours, till long dinner. They tried hard get Jack let take rifle them, unsuccessfully, he thought authorities would like it. At last Bevis deigned get up, driven home, his sullen mood Bevis would even touch reins, let Mark. He much offended. The idea resentment Ted never entered his mind. Ted his equal one thing, age. But he hated looked severe countenance he rogue stolen sixpence authorities he feel he done anything. He burned conspirators abroad burn rage government rules them. They Ted, equal; power used him. Bevis wrong unjust, tenderest kindest home authorities. At home dessert waiting table them, Burgundy. The Burgundy, wine much drunk country, got long time ago please Bevis, read Charles Bold fond took deep draughts it. Bevis fancied he like it, would make bold like Charles. Mamma poured glassful, Mark took his, said "Thank you." Bevis drank silence. "Are not glad come home?" said mamma. "No, _that_ I am not," said Bevis, marched bench-room. Mamma saw Mark wanted follow, she kissed him, recollecting he ventured storm Bevis, told he liked. "The sails ought finished now," said Bevis, Mark came up. "Yes," said Mark, "they are sure be. But know I cannot go." "You ought fetch them," said Bevis, "you are lieutenant; captains do not fetch sails." He ready important exertion, he great idea getting people inferior things him. "I cannot go," said Mark, "Frances hates me." "O! well," said Bevis savagely, ready quarrel anybody least pretext. The fact was, though resentful, he feel quite certain he approved his conduct his mother. He could knocked one recover confidence. He pushed Mark, slammed door, started get sails. Frances laughed she saw him. "Ah!" she said, "Mark care come, he?" She brought sails nicely hemmed--they ready days--and made parcel him. "So ran away battle," she said. "I did not," said Bevis rudely. "You sailed away--floated away." "Not run away." "Yes, did. And called Caesar." She liked tease him, fond him; she stroked his short golden curls, pinched his arm, kissed him, taunted him, praised him; walked he went homewards, asked he offer her his arm, he did, said she take boys' arms--_boys_ emphasis--till he grew scarlet irritation. Then she petted him, asked battle, said wonderful, he must show her battlefield. She made promise take her sail, looked delicious Bevis could choose smile. She her hat her hand, little hand white, like speck sunshine among shadows. Her little feet peeped among grass blue veronica flowers. Her rounded figure, tiny waist, looked instinct restless life, buoyant she floated. The bright light made her golden brown hair gleam. She lifted her long eyelashes, looked her grey eyes. Delicate arched eyebrows, small regular features, pouting lips, impudent chin. "You are little," said Bevis, able speak again. "I believe I could lift stile." She little--little delicious, like wild strawberry, daintily tinted, sweet, piquant, enough acid make want more, rare, seldom found. "As impertinent," said she, "I shall come farther." Bevis got stile first safe, he turned, said,-- "Jack day, he is big, he will manage you." "O!" said Frances, dropping her hat, "O!" Her little foot put forward, she stood bolt upright open lips. Scorn, utter, complete, perfect scorn expressed head foot. Jack manage her! The idea! Before she could recover her breath, Bevis, immediately started running, half across next field. Next morning set work fix blue boat sailing, first stepped mast wedged tight chip. A cord came side aslant gunwale, fastened there--these backstays strengthen mast wind blew rough. The bowsprit lashed firmly bow, sheets cords work foresail put staples, tiller fixed instead lines. They two sails--mainsail (without boom) foresail. Bevis thought topsail, found awkward contrive without ropes (they always called cords ropes) becoming entangled. The rigging sails up, Mark wanted unfurl see answered, Bevis, sullen mood, would let him, till everything completed. They put ballast, first bricks placed close together bottom, two small bags sand, large flat stone, thought would enough. All occupied great deal time, go backwards forwards house things tools forgotten, many little difficulties always arise anything new done. Nothing fits first time, done twice. So last thing all, oyster-barrel tin canister inside, put board, four afternoon. When began push boat ground get her afloat, found wind sunk. In morning blown steadily westward, busy work noticed noon gently declined. They pushed off, rowed hundred yards, shelter trees shore, breeze corner called harbour. The surface smooth, trees reflected it. Bevis sullen cross day, improve his temper. It rare continue angry like this, Mark resented it, talk much. Bevis unfurled sails hoisted up. The foresail worked perfectly, mainsail would go come quickly. It fastened mast ten twelve brass rings travellers, would slip, though looked plenty large enough. They stuck, pushed hand sail could hoisted. This proper, sails ought go easily without moment's delay, might indeed dangerous squall. Bevis pulled his knife, cut number off, leaving three four, sail worked much better. Next tried reefing, put two rows, second taken sail looked rather shapeless, Bevis angrily cut second row. He told Mark row back he furled, Mark so. After fastened boat painter willow root, picked tools, went homewards, leaving rigging standing ready use morrow. "There is two things now," said Mark, "that ought done." "What is that?" crossly. "There ought iron ring staple tie ship to--a ship ought tied root." "Get ring, then." "And another thing--two things." "That not." "That are. You want bowl bale water out, waves sure splash over." "That is nothing." "Well, then," said Mark savagely, "you have forgotten anchor." Bevis looked he could smashed him, went bench-room without word. "You are bear," shouted Mark bottom staircase. "I shall not come;" he went parlour found book. For remainder day, whenever met, minute tangent, bounded apart. Bevis cross bear, Mark would conciliate him, seeing he given least reason. At night quarrelled bedroom, Bevis grumbling Mark throwing his jacket chair he generally used, Mark pitching Bevis's waistcoat corner. About ten minutes candle out, Bevis got up, slipped his trousers jacket, went downstairs barefoot dark. "Glad you are gone," said Mark. Bevis opened door sitting-room his mother reading, walked her, kissed her, whispered, "I am sorry; tell governor," she could answer. Next morning he bright lark, every thing went smoothly again. The governor smiled more, asked intended sail first. "Serendib," said Mark. "A long voyage," said governor. "Thousands miles," said Bevis. "Come on, Mark; lot eat." Mark came, went meadow he said ought anchor. "So ought," said Bevis. "We will make one like picture--you know, wooden shaft, stone let it." "Like used first ships," said Mark. "And went cruising along shore--" "We have forgotten compass." "Of course, that is right; compass lived." "No; steered sun. Look, there is jolly wind." The water rippling light steady pleasant summer breeze north-west. They pushed out, boat slowly drifted, set sails. Directly foresail she turned moved bow first, like horse led bridle. When mainsail hoisted she began turn towards wind, Bevis, steered, pull tiller towards him, another minute would run weeds. He kept her straight wind till got bay boats kept, open water wind came stronger. Then he steered New Sea, wind blew right across boat, coming right-hand side. It beautiful breeze, one wanted, strong, best direction, could sail way back without trouble, soldier's wind, home again. Mark sat mast, windward side, trim boat weight make her stiffer. He work foresail tack, let mainsail white squall tornado struck ship. The ripples kissed bow merry smack, smack, smack; sometimes rush bubbles, could feel boat heel little wind moment blew harder. "How fast we are going!" said Mark. "Hurrah!" "Listen bubbles? Do not sails look jolly?" said Bevis. The sunshine shone white canvas hollowed wind; pilot looked he could see slender top mast tracing line azure sky. Is anything delicious first sail boat rigged yourself? Away she slipped, Mark began hum, knocking seat his knuckles keep time. Then Bevis sang, making tune his own, leaning back watching sails sheet handy let go puff came, voyaging unknown seas? Bevis sang two verses over:-- "Telling Count Arnaldos, With his hawk upon his hand, Saw fair stately galley, Steering onward land. `Learn secret sea? Only brave dangers, Comprehend mystery!'" Mark sang him, till by-and-by he said, "There is battlefield; country's that?" "Thessaly," said Bevis. "It is last land know; it is new, nobody knows anything." "Except us." "Of course." "Are going round straight up?" said Mark presently, came near Fir-Tree Gulf. "We ought coast," said Bevis. "They used to; must not go sight land." "Steer gulf then; mind stony point; what is that, what is name?" "I do not know," said Bevis. "It is dreadful place; awful rocks--smash, crash, ship's side stove in--no chance body escape there." "A raft would smashed." "Lifeboats swamped." "People jammed rocks." "Pounded jelly-fish." "But ought name? Is Cape Horn?" "I do not think so, that is way round world; we are India way, I think." "Perhaps it is Gibraltar." "As should not know Gibraltar!" "Of course should, I forgot. Look! There is little island passage--a channel. Mind steer--" "It is Scylla Charybdis," said Bevis. "I see quite plain." "Steer straight," said Mark. "There is much room, rocks one side, shoal other; it is pistol-shot wide--" "Not half pistol-shot." "We are going. Hark! bubbles!" Volume Two, Chapter VII. SAILING CONTINUED--"THERE SHE LAY, ALL THE DAY!" Bevis eased off, boat sailing right wind, blew direct gulf. Mark crawled bow see better shout directions pilot. "Left--left." "Port." "Well, port." "Starboard, now--that side. There, scraped weeds." The weeds made rustling sound boat passed them. "Right--right--starboard, side," holding his hand, "you will hit rocks; you are close." "Pooh!" said Bevis. "It is deeper rocks, do not remember." He prided steering within inch; boat glided sandy island rocky wall, close wall sail leaning side nearly swept it. Then he steered pass along three yards shore. The quarry opened out, went towards place bathed. "Kails," said Mark, "mind rails." By bathing-place posts rails continued water partly surface, boat might get fixed top. Bevis pushed tiller over, boat came round broadside wind, began cross head Fir-Tree Gulf. The ripples increased size, became wavelets breeze, crossing wider surface water, blew straight shore, seemed rush stronger draught trees. These wavelets large enough make boat dance, caused splashing bow, she heeled little wind. They slipped across head gulf, two hundred yards, good pace, steering mouth Nile. "Tack," said Bevis, came near. "It is almost time. Get ready." Mark unfastened cord sheet left side, foresail pulling, held his hand. "I am ready," he said, minute,--"Quick, shall shore." Bevis pushed tiller hard left, time telling Mark let go. Mark loosened foresheet, boat turning right carried her impetus pressure mainsail towards wind. Bevis expected her he seen yachts ships seaside, he read proper way, come round slowly facing wind, till she passed straight line breeze, Mark would tighten foresheet, wind would press foresail like lever complete turn. He watched foresail eagerly, moment shout Mark; boat moved towards wind, paused, hung, began fall back again. The wind blew her back. Bevis jammed tiller still harder, rose his seat, bawled, "Mark! Mark!" he jerked back moment she took ground. Mark seized scull push her off, letting go sheet foresail flapped furiously, drawing cord rope staple would snap it. Bevis, fearing boat would turn over, let go mainsheet, mainsail flew left side, flapping shaking mast, sheet rope struck water splashed hit whip. "Pull mainsail," shouted Bevis, stumbling forward. "Hold tight," shouted Mark, giving great shove scull. The boat came off, Bevis thrown ballast. The wind took her could scramble places, she drifted across mouth Nile grounded again. "Down sail, I tell you," shouted Bevis rage. "Not one--the big one." Mark undid cord halyard, fell mainsail boat, covering Bevis, get he could anything. "Did ever see bother?" said Mark. "Is anything broken?" said Bevis. "No. You ought tacked sooner." "How could I tell? She would not come round." "You ought room try twice." "So next time." "Let us go Nile turn round, get sails there," said Mark. "It flapping here." Bevis agreed, pushed boat along sculls yards Nile quite smooth there, mouth quick wavelets dashed shore. The bank river trees sheltered turned boat's head round, carefully set sails another trial. "We will two tries time," said Bevis, "and we are sure it. If cannot tack, it is use sailing." When everything ready, Mark rowed strokes one oar till wind began fill sails; he shipped it, sat ballast windward side. The moment she outside Nile splashing began, Mark, his great delight, felt little spray his face. "This real sailing," he said. "Now we are going," said Bevis, boat increased her speed. "Lot's see much gain tack." He kept her close wind he could, still sails well filled drawing. He let mainsail hollow somewhat, thinking would hold wind draw faster. "Hurrah!" said Mark; "we are getting good way up; there is big sarsen--we shall get it." There large sarsen boulder, great brown stone, lying shore quarry side gulf, thirty yards bathing-place. If could get high boulder, would mean crossing gulf tack gained thirty yards direct course, thirty yards wind. To Mark looked sailing straight boulder, boat really going exact direction her bow pointed. She inclined right, found her actual course he ought looked stem lee bow. The lee side away wind. That say, she drifted made leeway, got closer surprised see she high boulder ten yards. She bunch rushes Bevis told Mark ready. He allowed space enough time two trials. "Now," said Bevis, pushing tiller right; "let go." Mark loosened foresail, might offer resistance wind, check boat turning. Bevis pushed tiller still harder, she going good pace impetus made her answer rudder better. "She is coming," shouted Mark. "Jam rudder." The rudder jammed, bow seemed face wind, another foot would enabled Mark tighten foresail, let draw her quite round like lever, she lost forward motion. "O! dear!" said Bevis, stamping vexation. The boat stopped moment, slowly fell back. "Pull tight," said Bevis, meaning refasten foresheet. Mark so, boat began move ahead again. "We are close," said Mark almost directly. "Tack," said Bevis. "Let go." He tried run her wind again, time, less weigh impetus, she come nearly far round, began pay off, fall back directly, and, Mark could get scull out, bumped heavily shore, stony there. "Let us row her head round," said Mark. "Sculls ought used," said Bevis. "It is lubberly." "Awful lubberly," said Mark. "But do?" "Pull away, anyhow," said Bevis. Mark put scull, pushed her off, trouble pulled till her head came round. Then he shipped scull, began sail again. "We have not got inch," said Bevis. "Just look; rails." They made twenty yards, missing stays twice, drifting, rowing round, lost boat could get right again, sails began draw well. "What ever it?" said Mark. "What do not do?" "I cannot think," said Bevis. "It is stupid. That is better." There hissing bubbling, boat, impelled stronger puff, rushed along, seemed edge way wind. "Splendid," said Mark. "We shall get Nile time, shall get willow." A willow-tree stood shore side way up. The boat appeared move direct it. "I shall tack soon," said Bevis, "while we have got good wind." "Tack now," said Mark. "It does not matter going right across." "All right--now; let go." They tried again, same; boat paused came back: again, still use. "Row," said Bevis. "Bother!" Mark rowed scull lee side, got her round. "Now, look," said Bevis. "Just look!" He pointed Nile. They drifted last turned nearly level mouth river started. "Let row quicker next time," said Mark. "Let row directly. It is hateful, though." "It is hateful," said Bevis. "Sailing without tacking stupid. Nobody would ever think sailors see us rowing round." "What is done?" said Mark. "Now try." Bevis put tiller down, Mark pulled her head round quick he could. By time sails begun draw lost half gained, crossing breeze slackened little lost rest, found before, mouth Nile. "I do not think keep her tight enough," said Mark, began cross again. "Try her closer. Close-hauled, know." "So I will," said Bevis; breeze rising he pulled mainsheet tighter (while Mark tightened foresheet), pushed tiller somewhat. The boat came closer wind, seemed sailing straight quarry. "There," said Mark, "we shall get gulf two tacks." "But we are going slow," said Bevis. "It does not matter get quarry." The boat continued point quarry, Bevis watched mainsail intently, his hand tiller, keeping her sail shiver, yet near possible. "Splendid," said Mark, his knees ballast, looking stem. "Splendid. It is almost time tack." He lifted foresail, peered shore. "I say--well, Bevis!" "What it?" asked Bevis. "I am watching mainsail; time?" "We have not got inch--we are going--let us see--not far rushes." All boat's head pointed quarry she making great leeway, drifting wind waves. The sails scarcely drew, she motion cut her way wind. Instead edging it, she really crossed gulf nearly straight line, almost level spot whence she started. When Bevis tried get her found, she would come all. She moving slowly she impetus, wind blew her back. Mark row round again. "That is use," he said. "But looked was." "She will not sail near wind," said Bevis, crossed towards Nile. "We must let her run free, keep sails hollow." They crossed crossed five times more, still came mouth Nile, back bunch rushes. "I believe it is jib," said Bevis, sailed quarry side more. "Let us try without jib. Perhaps it is jib will not let her come round. Take down." Mark took foresail down, boat show disposition run wind; Bevis tried tack she went half-way, payed came back, nearly ran railings, much drift. Still tried without foresail again; boat found sail fast, least use, she would come round. So re-set foresail. Again sailed fro, shore Nile bunch rushes, never gained foot, one way lost other. They silent time. "It is like Bay Biscay," said Mark. "`There she lay, day, In Bay Biscay, O!' "And sails look jolly too." "I cannot make out," said Bevis. "The sails proper, I am sure are. What be? We shall never get gulf." "And rowing round too," said Mark. "Lubberly." "Horrid," said Bevis. "I hope there is ship looking us. The sailors would laugh so. I know--Mark!" "Yes." "Do not row next time; we will wear ship." "What is that?" "Turn way--with wind. Very often boom knocks tears mast out." "Capital, we have boom. What must I do?" "Nothing; you will see. Sit still--in middle. Now." Bevis put tiller windward. The boat paid rapidly leeward, described circle, mainsail passing opposite side, took wind giving jerk mast. Mark tightened foresheet, began sail back again. "But look!" said he. "Horrid," said Bevis. In describing circle lost gained, level mouth Nile, five yards shore head gulf. It much tack could get railings; fifteen yards least rushes, Bevis put tiller windward, tried thing again. The boat turned circle leeward, she could get right round begin sail again, gone near shore, drifting, Mark put scull case bump. In crossing time wind blew light could get mouth Nile. "It is use wearing ship," said Mark. "Not bit; lose ever. You would better row again," said Bevis reluctantly. Mark pulled her round again, sailed fro three times more, keep position, wind perceptibly less day went on, became near noon. "I hate rushes," said Mark, he pulled her head round more. Bevis reply, time he steered straight across Nile till bank sheltered wind. There took sails, quite beaten, day least, rowed back harbour. Next morning arrived New Sea found wind came water, turned little south, force. They started again, sailed well till opposite hollow oak day battle supposed Bevis hidden. Here wind head-wind, could work tacking, came tack found difficulty yesterday. All space gained tack lost coming round boat could get weigh her. They sailed fro hollow oak willow bushes side, could advance farther. Sometimes got oak, fell back behind willow bushes; sometimes worked twenty yards higher willow bushes, dropped oak. Bevis soon discovered made better tacks then; wind shifted little, directly oppose them. The instant returned usual course could progress sea. By willow bushes could partly see Fir-Tree Gulf; yesterday could sail gulf, to-day, efforts, could sail it. After twenty trials compelled beaten, returned harbour. Bevis much troubled failure, soon got home he asked Mark go bench-room, anything he liked, leave he looked old encyclopaedia. Mark he asked, knowing Bevis always learnt anything best himself. Bevis went bedroom, great book remained open chair, knelt down, set work read everything ships navigation. There whole history boats ships, papyrus canoes Nile, made plaiting stalks, earthenware boats, hide boats, rafts skins, hollowed trees, bark canoes, catamarans, proas. There account triremes Rome, caravels, bilanders, galliots, zebecs, great three-deckers. The book quite reach days glorious Nelson. It laid course supposed followed Ulysses, described voyages Phoenicians Britain. The parts three-decker pictured, instruments navigation explained illustrations. Everything except Bevis wanted, exhaustive really interesting treatise, plain directions tack. There terms orders nautical language, explanation done. Bevis shut book up, rose sigh, he become occupied his search he unconsciously checked his breathing. He went bookcase stood thoughtfully. Presently he recollected something yachting modern book sports. He found read carefully, though began Daedalus, finished exact measurement successful prize-winning yacht, he could make he wanted. The account complete even wages seamen method signalling flags. There glossary terms, nothing tell tack, is, nothing he could understand. He put book away, went blue-painted summer-house think again. What really want know never book, one tell you. By-and-by, keep steadily memory ever eyes open, hit accident. Some mere casual incident throws solution right hands unexpected moment. Bevis fitted his boat according his recollections he seen pictures. There sailing-boat he could go see nearer forty miles. As he sat thinking Mark rushed up. He, too, thinking, he found something. "I know," he said. "What?" "We got enough ballast," said Mark. "That is it--I am sure that is it. Do not remember boat kept drifting?" "Very likely," said Bevis. "Yes, that is it; stupid were. Let us get directly. I know; I will ask governor bag shot." The governor allowed take bag, weighed twenty-eight pounds, condition put inside small sack, look like sand, else one might steal it. They also found two pieces iron, scraps, made fresh ballast forty pounds. The wind gone soon midday, could nothing. But next morning blew south, afloat directly breakfast. The effect ballast Mark anticipated; boat drift much, she made less leeway, she stiffer, is, she stood wind better. They lose much quite, still gain, would she come round without using scull; indeed, she even worse respect, obstinate, she would come wind, weight seemed hold her back. After two hours obliged give third time. The following day wind. "Let us make anchor," said Mark, "and we are making anchor perhaps shall think something tacking." So began make anchor, picture one old folio. They found square piece deal, six inches four, sawed two feet. In middle cut long hole right through, much trouble found flat stone fit it. This wedged tight, fastened tar-cord. Near one end small square hole cut, put square rod iron, blacksmith sold shilling--about three times value. The rod eighteen inches long, bent up, curved, ends filed blunt point. It fitted tight, wedged still firmer nails, put opposite way stone, stone tried sink flat bottom, one points bar would stick ground. Mark thought ought cross-piece wood iron proper anchors, far could make out, attached ancient stone-weighted ones, put it. Lastly, hole bored end shaft, rope cable (a stout cord) inserted fastened. Looking eagerly window morning see wind delighted see clouds drifting north-north-west. This capital wind could tack. It blowing first day sailed Fir-Tree Gulf could get out, would taken end New Sea considered proper coast round. This time meant sail straight centre straight back. Volume Two, Chapter VIII. SAILING CONTINUED--VOYAGE TO THE UNKNOWN ISLAND. After breakfast got afloat, away trees boat began sail fast, every bubbles rushed bow. Mark sat ballast, rather reclined, Bevis steered. The anchor upon forecastle, called it, twenty-five feet cable. Sailing bluff covered furze, oak council held, past muddy shore lined weeds cattle came drink, past hollow oak battlefield, saw quarry Fir-Tree Gulf, enter it. As reached broader water wind came fresher wide surface, boat careening little hastened on. They long way either shore centre widest part. "This best sail we have had," said Mark, putting his legs far he could, leaning his back seat his head mast. "It is jolly." Bevis got stern-sheets sat bottom he could recline, he nothing keep tiller steady watch mainsail, wind set course them. They could feel breeze pulling sails, boat drawn along. "Is rough?" said Mark. "Shall take reef?" said Bevis. "No," said Mark. "Let us capsize." "Right," said Bevis. "It does not matter." "Not bit. Is not she slipping along?" "Gurgling guggling." "Bubbling smacking. That spray." "There is puff. How many knots going?" "Ten." "Pooh! twenty. No chance pirate catching us." "In unknown seas," said Mark, "you cannot tell proas waiting behind islands, many Malays creeses." "They are crooked wrong way," said Bevis. "The curious knives I ever saw." "Or junks," went Mark. "Are Chinese Seas?" "Jingalls," said Bevis, "they shoot big bullets, almost cannon-balls, big walnuts. I wish one forecastle." "We ought cannon." "Of course did." "As could not manage cannon!" "As if!" "Or double-barrel gun." "Or anything." "Anything." "People _are_ stupid." "Idiotic." "We must gun." "We must." They listened gurgling "guggling," bubbles, kiss, kiss wavelets. "We are long way now," said Mark presently. "Can see land?" "See land! We lost sight land months ago. I think not. Look there." Bevis watching top mast, tracing line along sky, white filmy clouds floating slowly. Mark opened his drowsy eyes looked too. "No land sight," said he. "Nothing sky clouds," said Bevis. "How far shore?" "Six thousand miles." "It is first time anybody ever sailed sight land time," said Mark. "It is wonderful, shall made great deal get home." "Yes, put prison afterwards. That is proper way." "We shall bring home sandal-wood, diamonds big as--as apples--" "And see unknown creatures sea, butterflies huge umbrellas--" "Catch fevers get well again--" "We must make notes language, coax people give us ancient books." "O! I say," said Mark, "when Unknown Island see magician long white robes, serpent hundred feet long he keeps cave bushes?" "No," said Bevis, "I forgot him." So he had. His imagination ran rapidly, one thing took place particles water take other's place running brook. "We shall find him, I dare say." "Let us land see." "So will." "Are sure you are steering right?" "O! yes; it is nothing do, keep wind sails." "I wonder bird is?" said Mark, dove flew over. He knew dove well enough land. "It is sort parrot, doubt." "I wonder deep here." "About million fathoms." "No use trying anchor." "Not least." "It is warm." "In places ships get burnt sun sometimes." Another short silence. "Is time take look-out, captain?" "Yes, I think so," said captain. Mark crept bow. "You are steering much right--that way," he cried, holding his right arm. "Is better?" "More over." "There." "Right." As boat fell little wind obeying tiller, Bevis, foresail his line sight could see Unknown Island. They closer thought. "Shall land Serendib?" "O! no--on island," said Mark. "Steer close cliff can." Bevis so, boat approached low sandy cliff waves beat fury. The wavelets washed sideways past gentle splashing, large enough make boat dance, liked could gone touched it. "It looks deep it," said Mark, Bevis steered channel, keeping two three yards shore. "Ready," he said; "get ready furl mainsail." Mark partly unfastened halyard, held his hand. Almost directly passed cliff lee island kept wind. The boat moved, carried impetus still water, sails draw. In minute Bevis told Mark let mainsail down, dropped Mark hauled sail folds would fallen water. At moment Bevis altered course, ran her ashore way he leaped punt, low shelving. Mark instant she touched painter, tugged her strand. Bevis came forward let foresail, he got out. "Captain," said Mark, "may I go round island?" "Yes," said captain, Mark stepped among bushes explore. Bevis went little way sat beech. The hull boat hidden undergrowth, he could see slender mast rigging boughs. The sunshine touched top smooth mast, seemed shine green leaves. There vessel; his comrade exploring unknown depths wood; far old world known countries. He sat gloated voyage, till by-and-by he remembered tacking. They could it, even yet half mariners, obliged wait fair wind. If changed island would row back. He longer satisfied; he went boat, stepped board, hoisted sails. The trees island kept wind perfectly calm, sails even flutter. He stepped shore, went yards he could look back get good view vessel, trying think could do, could wrong. He looked her over, top mast tiller, he could discover anything. Bevis walked down, he worked quite fidget. He went wood little way, half inclined go Mark he felt restless. All he took his pocket-book pencil sat ground he was, drew sailing-boat he seen. Then he went back shore, sketched boat leaf. His idea compare sailing-boats he seen theirs. When he finished his outline drawing he saw directly several differences. The mast boat sketched memory much higher mast other. Both sails, too, larger he made. The bowsprit projected farther, foresail much less proportion mainsail. The foresail looked almost large enough, mainsail boat smaller, shape. In his sketch memory gaff rod top sail rose sharper angle, sail came right back tiller. In actual boat gaff little horizontal mast, sail came back three-fourths distance ought done. "It must made bigger," Bevis thought. "The mainsail must made ever much larger, must reach I sit. That is mistake--you see minute. Mark! Mark!" He shouted whistled. Mark came presently running. "I have round," he said panting, "and I have--" "This it," said Bevis, holding his pocket-book. "I have seen huge jack--a regular shark. I believe shark--and three young wild ducks, parrots trees." "The mainsail--" "And something water made wave, went along--" "Look, see ought come--" "What could made wave went along?" "O! nothing--only porpoise, seal, walrus--nothing! Look here--" "But," said Mark, "the wave moved along, I could tell made it." "Magic," said Bevis. "Very likely magician. Did see him?" "No; I believe there is something curious island--" "It is enchanted, course," said Bevis. "There is lots things know there, cannot find," said Mark; "there is tiger, I believe, bushes reeds end. If I spear I gone looked, there is boa-constrictors hippopotamus last night, heaps jolly things, I have found place make cave. Come see," (pulling Bevis). "I will come," said Bevis, "in minute. But look, I have found wrong--" "And tack?" "Yes." "Then let us it, tack get shipwrecked, live here. If Jack's rifle." "But must sail properly first," said Bevis. "I shall not anything till sail properly: it. Look." He showed Mark two sketches, mainsail reach back far enough towards stern. "Frances must make larger," said Mark. "Of course that is it--it is different possible. And mast ought higher--it would crack better, go overboard--whop!" "I do not know," said Bevis; "about mast; yes, I think I will. We make one foot eighteen inches higher--" "Bigger sails go faster, smash ship splendidly rocks," said Mark. "There will crash grinding, decks blow up, there will awful yell everybody gulped me." "While we are it, we will make another bowsprit, too--longer," said Bevis. "Why did not think before," said Mark. "How stupid! Now look it, see minute. And sail half round world find it." "That is it," said Bevis. "You sail forty thousand miles find thing, get see left home." "We stupes," said Mark. "Let us directly. I will shave new mast, take sails Frances. And come see place cave." Bevis went him, Mark took bank bluff inside island Bevis passed he explored evening battle. The sandy bank rose steeply ten fifteen feet, covered brambles fern. There space foot clear bushes trees, overgrown rough grasses. Beyond great bramble thickets, trees began fifty yards away, encircling open space. The spot almost centre island, rather nearer side channel weeds other. "The sand's soft hard," said Mark. "I tried knife; cut it, will not crumble." "We prop roof," said Bevis. "No, it is dry chips; it is splendid place cave ever was." "So is," said Bevis. "Nobody could see us." He looked round. The high bank shut behind, trees front side. "Besides, there is nobody look. It is capital." "Will it," said Mark. "Of course I will--directly sail properly." "Hurrah!" shouted Mark, hitting his heels, caught trick Bevis. "Let us go home begin sails. Come on." "But I know one thing," said Bevis, returned boat; "if we are going cave, must gun." "That is I say. Cannot borrow one? I know, put Frances make Jack lend us his rifle. She is fond you--she hates me." "I will try," said Bevis. "How ought get girl anything?" "Stare her," said Mark. "That is Jack does, like donk thistle he cannot eat more." "Does Frances like staring?" "She pretends she does not, she does. You stare her, act stupid." "Is Jack stupid?" "When he is house," said Mark. "He is stupid owl. Now she kisses you, whisper squeeze her hand, say it is tiny. You do not know conceited she her hand--cannot see--she is always got somewhere see it; she sticks her foot so," (Mark put one foot out); "and do not move inch, stick close her, get her corner arbour. Mind, though, do not keep telling her pretty she is, she will box ears. That is she hates me--" "Because do not tell her she is pretty. But she pretty." "But I am going always telling her so--I do not see she is anything beautiful either--you I look nice afternoon hair, walked like stuck noses air; kept grinning, smacked powder, scent, beastly stuff. Now Jack's rifle--" "We could make shoot," said Bevis, "if ourselves, put bullets apples stuck stick, smash egg--" "And knock parrots trees." "I _will_ gun," said Bevis, kicking stone his might. "Are sure Frances could get Jack--" "Frances get Jack it! Why, I have seen kiss her foot." They got board laughing set sails, island kept wind off, Mark row till beyond cliff. Then sails filled away went. "Thessaly," said Mark presently. "See! we are getting places people live again. I say, shall try anchor?" "Yes. Let mainsail first." Mark let down, put anchor over. It sank rapidly, drawing cable it. The flat stone shaft endeavoured sank lie flat bottom, brought one flukes points ground, motion boat dragging caused stick inches. The cable tightened, boat brought swung her stem wind. Mark found want cable; he hauled till ten feet out; that, allowing angle, water much five six feet deep. They muddy shore, lined weeds. Rude anchor was, answered perfectly. In minute two hauled up, set mainsail, sailed almost harbour, row last yards trees kept much breeze off. They unshipped mast, carried sails home. In evening Mark set work shave another somewhat longer pole new mast, Bevis took sails canvas Frances. He long gone, he returned said Frances promised work immediately. "Did cat mouse?" said Mark. "Did stare?" "I stared," said Bevis, "but visitors there--" "Stupes?" "Stupes, I could not get well. She asked I looking at, she was not right--" "She meant her flounces; she thinks nothing her flounces. Some things called gores." "But I began rifle, she said perhaps, she really influence Jack." "O!" said Mark snort. "Another buster." "And she could not think did not come home. She forgiven long time, always unkind her, she always forgiving you." "Busters," said Mark. "She is telling stories morning night." "I do not see afraid her; she cannot hurt you." "Not hurt me! Why you have done anything--it is niggle-niggle, niggle-naggle, she will play every nasty trick, set Old Moke look cross; Jack comes, it is `Mark, dear Mark,' would not think she sweet darling loved her brother!" Mark tore shaving. "One thing though," he added. "Will not she serve Jack he is got her obliged her. As I did not know she wants come home. All she wants send letters him." "Postman. I see," said Bevis. "But I will go," said Mark. "I will go fetch sails to-morrow. I like see jolly Old Moke; do not see? I take letters she will pleased get rifle us." It exceedingly disrespectful Mark speak his governor Old Moke; his actual behaviour different his speech, truth he attached his father. The following afternoon Mark walked got sails, he guessed Frances gave note Jack, he deliver evening. They surprised donkey; Mark mounted rode off. Bevis went mast new gaff bowsprit, Mark got back sunset he new mast rigging fitted she would see looked. The first time made mast took long while, now, learned exactly it, second soon prepared. The top rose beam she would, mainsail stretched eave. "Hoist peak higher," said governor. Being busy heard come. "Hoist well, Mark." Mark gave another pull halyard, drew peak, point gaff, till stood sharp angle. "The peak get," said governor, "the leverage wind has, better she answer rudder." He almost interested sailing themselves, watched bank New Sea concealed behind trees. But he considered best teach themselves, find little little wrong. Besides he knew greatest pleasure always obtained inferior incomplete instruments. Present perfect yacht, beautiful horse, fine gun, anything complete beginner, edge his enjoyment dulled speedy possession. The best way learn ride rough pony, sail open ill-built boat, encountering difficulties learner comes understand appreciate perfect instrument, wield direct fifty times power he born purple. From shore governor watched vainly striving tack, could refrain pointing reason. When he saw fitting enlarged sails new mast, he exulted almost much themselves. "They it," he said himself, "they time." Then Bevis, "Pull mainsail back far can, do not let hollow out, hollow loose. Keep taut. It ought flat board. There--" He turned away abruptly, fearing he told much. "As flat board," repeated Bevis. "So I will. But thought best hollow, did not we?" There still enough light left see step mast, carried sails rigging boat, fitted evening. Volume Two, Chapter IX. SAILING CONTINUED--THE PINTA--NEW FORMOSA. In morning wind blew south, coming length New Sea. Though light steady brought larger waves yet sailed in, far roll. Still half high day battle, came rolling slowly, curl foam then. The sails set, drifted rather sailed sheltered harbour, boat began rise fall, intense delight. "Now it is proper sea," said Mark. "Keep ready," said Bevis. "She is going. We shall across two minutes." He hauled mainsheet taut, kept governor told him, flat board. Smack! The bow hit wave, threw handfuls water Mark, knelt ballast forward, ready work foresheets. He shouted joy, "It is sea, it is real sea!" Smack! smack! His jacket streaked splotched spray; he pushed his wet hair his eyes. Sish! sish! bubbling hiss boat bent over, cut waves like knife. So much canvas drove her breeze, she went athwart waves every third one rose windward bow like fountain, spray flew, straight up, horizontally Mark's cheek. There wide dark patches sails already wet. Bevis felt tiller press his hand like reins strong fresh horse. It vibrated water parted rudder behind. The least movement tiller changed her course. Instead hold tiller manner keep boat's head wind, he rather keep her off, she wanted fly face breeze, he moderate ardour. The broad mainsail taut, flat board, strove drive bow windward. "Look behind," said Mark. "Just see." There wake opening bubbles foam, waves moment smoothed swift progress. Opposite harbour New Sea wide, always seemed long way across, hardly looked sails wake, listened hissing splashing, time tack. "Ready," said Bevis. "Let go." Mark let go, foresail bulged fluttered, offering resistance wind. Bevis pushed tiller over, mainsail way last drove head boat wind, half round, three-quarters; faced it, boat pitched. The mainsail shivered; edge faced wind. "Pull," said Bevis next moment. Mark pulled foresheet tight side. It drew directly, like lever brought her head round, completing turn. The mainsail flew across. Bevis hauled sheet tight. She rolled, heaved, sprang forward. "Hurrah! We have done it! Hurrah!" They shouted kicked boat. Wish! spray flew, soaking Mark's jacket side, filling his pocket water, even coming back far Bevis's feet. Sish! sish! The wind puffed, rigging sang; mast leaned; she showed her blue side; involuntarily moved near windward could. Wish! The lee gunwale slipped along, surface water, skimming like swallow. Smack! Such soaker. The foresail wet; bowsprit dipped twice. Swish! The mainsail dotted spray. Smack! Mark bent his head, received his hat. "Ready!" shouted captain. The foresheet slipped Mark's hand, flapped, hit like whip till he caught rope. The mainsail forced her wind; foresail tightened levered her round. She rolled, heaved, sprang forward. Next time better, without word spoken. Mark learned exact moment tighten sheet, she came round quicker ever. In four tacks opposite bluff, seventh brought council oak. As wind blew directly New Sea tack same. Bevis began see much depended upon moment he chose coming about, always answer go right across. If he waited till within yards shore wind sometimes fell, boat immediately lost weigh, impetus, though she came round slowly, she began sail made little leeway. He found best tack sailing full speed, he threw her head windward she actually ran yards direct wind, gained much. Besides gained coming aslant across water end tack she shot eye wind, made additional headway like that. So watching breeze, seizing favourable opportunity, he made much he would done merely travelling far possible. The boat badly built, straight, stiff lines, crank, awkward craft. She ought foot broader, swelling, she would swung round like top. Bevis might crossed shore, though wind lessened, without fear leeway. But she came round badly even best. They thought she came round first-rate, mistaken. Had she done so, she would resumed return course without moment's delay, instead staggering, rolling, heaving, gradually coming her work again. Bevis watch breeze coax her. His eye constantly sail, he felt tiller, handling delicate touch like painter's brush. He calculate decide quickly whether space time enough puff come reached shore, whether he better sacrifice end tack come round once. Sometimes he wrong, sometimes right. In narrow space, boat, everything depended upon coming round well. His workmanship grew better advanced. He seemed feel boat rudder mast, sheet his hand bowsprit. The touch, feeling his hand, seemed penetrate beyond contact tiller, feel wood rope part like his arm. He responded wind quickly sail. If fell, he let her easier, keep pace up; blew, he kept her closer, gain every inch increased impetus. He watched mainsail hauled taut like board, lest shiver. He watched foresail, lest he keep close, cease draw. He stroked, soothed, caressed, coaxed her, put her best foot foremost. Our captains coax huge ironclads. With machinery, science, elaboration, gauges, mathematically correct everything, iron monsters would never come safe anchorage without exquisite coaxing. You must coax everything want succeed; ironclads, fortune, Frances. Bevis coaxed his boat, suited her her little ways; he yielded her; he waited her; he gave her her head let her feel freedom; now, he hinted, best moment; suddenly his hand grew firm, round she came. Do suppose he could learnt wind wave sail like he perfect yacht trim saucy Arethusa herself? Never. The crooked ways awkward craft brought his ingenuity. As advanced New Sea became narrower, till came opposite battlefield channel hundred yards wide. In straits waves came greater force quicker; wore higher, followed quickly, wind blew harder, also confined. It tack, tack, tack. No sooner sheets hauled, begun forge ahead, come about. Flap, flutter, pitch, heave, again. Smack! smack! The spray flew over. Mark buttoned his jacket his throat, jammed his hat hard his head. The rope, sheet, twisted round Bevis's hand, cut his skin, made red weal. He could give turn round cleat time. The mainsail pulled almost force his hand. Just got speed up, shower spray flying Mark, round she come. Pitch, pitch, roll, heave forward, smack! splash! bubble, smack! On battlefield side Bevis could go close shore lined band weeds; willow bushes water, actual channel less distance bank bank. Each tack gained yards, crossed recrossed nearly twenty times began get strait. The sails wet now, drew better; worked silence, without word, thought. "It now," said Mark. "Once more," said Bevis. "Now," said Mark, come round. "Yes!" From westward shore Bevis kept her close wind, water opened out, he steered Fir-Tree Gulf. He calculated he clear stony promontory. Against rocky wall waves dashed rose high it, spray carried bank quarry. The sandbank islet front concealed, water running it, site marked boiling surge. The waves broke it, met waves thrown back wall; charging other, sprang pointed tips, parted fell. Over grassy bank rolled brown froth, lifted blown away. This one places wind always seems blow greater force. In gale southwest difficult walk along bank, even light breeze waves ran stony point mad. Bevis steered Scylla Charybdis, keeping little nearer sunken islet time, waves roared broke side them, froth caught sails, boat shook reflux swept back met oncoming current; rocky wall seemed fly by, instant past gulf. Hauling wind, boat shot receding shore, approached firs already half across Nile. Returning, broad splendid sea sail in, tack took far next time outside gulf. It really sailing now, long tacks, "legs," edging aslant wind, leaving quarry far behind. "It is splendid," said Mark. "Let steer now." Bevis agreed, Mark crept aft hands knees, anxious disturb trim boat; Bevis went forward took his place manner, buttoning his jacket turning his collar. Mark steered quite well. Bevis learned work boat, coax her, boat sails themselves. Mark learned Bevis, much quicker. It requires time, continued observation, keenest perception learn nature. When one thus acquired art, others learn short easily. Mark steered handled sheet, brought her round handily he time. These lengthened zigzags soon carried far broad water, farther went smaller waves became, much less distance come, till presently big ripples, boat ceased dance. As waves oppose her progress much, little spray, she slipped faster. The motive power, wind, same; opposing force, waves, less. The speed increased, soon approached Bevis's island, worked whole distance wind. They agreed land, Mark brought her spot got before. Bevis doused mainsail, leaped out, tugged her well aground. After Mark stepped ashore careened boat baled water. There tree root sufficiently near fasten painter to, took anchor, carried way inland, forced one flukes ground. The boat quite safe far enough aground drift off, proper leave ship without mooring her. Mark wanted go look place he thought well adapted cave, walked bushes, he suddenly remembered vessel accomplished successful voyage got name. "The ship ought name," he said. "Blue boat sounds stupid." "So she ought," said Bevis. "Why did not think before? There is Arethusa, Agamemnon, Sandusky, Orient--" "Swallow, Viking, Saint George--but will not do," said Mark. "Those ships sail steam; old ships--" "Argo," said Bevis. "I wonder name Ulysses' ship--" "I know," said Mark, "Pinta--that is it. One Columbus's ships, know. He first go there, we are first New Sea." "So are; shall Pinta, I will paint it, island ought name too." "Of course. Let us see: Tahiti?" said Mark. "Loo-choo?" "Celebes?" "Carribbees?" "Cyclades? But lot islands, are not they?" "Formosa good name," said Bevis. "It sounds right. But I do not know is--it is somewhere." "Do not matter--call New Formosa." "Capital," said Bevis. "The thing; there is New Zealand New Guinea. Right. It is New Formosa." "Or Land Magic." "New Formosa Magic Land," said Bevis. "I will write map made get home." "Here is place," said Mark. "This cave ought be," pointing spot sandy cliff rose nearly perpendicular; "and ought hut it." "Poles stuck leaning thatched." "Yes, palisade thick stakes stuck in, front door." "So one could take us surprise night." "And far enough us fire inside." "Twist bushes stakes." "Quite impassable naked savages." "How high?" "Seven feet." "Or nearly." "We could make bed, sleep night." "Would not splendid stop altogether?" "First-rate; stupid sillinesses." "No bother." "Have dinner like." "Nobody bother you have to." "Let us live here." "All right. Only must gun shoot birds things eat," said Bevis. "It is use unless gun; it is proper, anything." "No is," said Mark; "we _must_ gun. Go stare Frances." "But takes time, know slow Jack is. It would take three months make his mind lend us rifle." "So would," said Mark; "Jack's awful slow, like his old mill-wheel there." "Round round," said Bevis. "Boom splash rumble,"--swinging his arm--"round round, never get farther." "Not inch," said Mark. "Stop; there is Tom's gun." He meant bird-keeper's. "Pooh!" said Bevis, "that is rotten old rusty rubbish. Is not anybody could borrow one of?" "Nobody," said Mark; "they are stupid afraid." "Donks." "Awful donks! Let us sell watches, buy one," said Mark. "Only would ask done watches." "I know," said Bevis, suddenly kicking his heels, standing one foot spinning round--"I know!" "What it! Quick! Tell me!" "Make one," said Bevis. "Make one?" "A matchlock," said Bevis. "Make matchlock. And matchlock quite proper, used have--" "But barrel?" "Buy iron tube," said Bevis. "They lots Latten, ironmonger's; buy iron pipe, stop one end--" "I see," said Mark. "Hurrah!" went his heels, wild capering half minute. "The bother make breech," said Bevis. "It ought screw, cannot that." "Ask blacksmith," said Mark; "we need let know it is for." "If he does not know we will find somehow," said Bevis. "Come on, let us directly. Why did not think before." They returned towards boat. "Just will not splendid," said Mark. "First, we will get everything ready, get shipwrecked proper, jolly anything." "Matchlocks capital guns," said Bevis; "they are slow shoot with, know, kill better rifles. They long barrels, put rest take steady aim, we will iron ramrod too, bother making place put rod stock, ram bullets shoot tigers savages." "Jolly!" "The stock must curved," said Bevis; "not like guns, broad flat, curved, must thing hold match; remind buy spring keep hammer up, shall fall till pull trigger--it is opposite guns, do not see? The spring keep match up, pull spring. And there is pan cover it--a bit tin would capital--and push open thumb. I have seen lots matchlocks glass cases, inlaid gold silver." "We do not want that." "No want shooting. The match bother--" "Would tar-cord do?" "We will try; first let us make breech. Take anchor." Mark picked anchor, put board. They launched Pinta, set sail homewards, Mark steering. As running right wind, ship went great pace. "That is Mozambique," said Bevis, passed strait make many tacks before. "Land ho!" said Mark, approached harbour. "We have capital sail." "First-rate," said Bevis. "But let us make matchlock." Now he succeeded tacking he eager go next thing, especially matchlock-gun. The hope shooting made three times ready carry Mark's plan cave island. After furling sails, leaving everything ship-shape, ran home changed jackets, soaked. Volume Two, Chapter X. MAKING A GUN--THE CAVE. Talking upstairs barrel gun, began think would awkward thing bring home, people would look walking town iron pipe, got home, people might ask for. Presently Mark remembered John Young went Latten day horse cart fetch things; bought tube, Young could call it, bring cart leave his cottage. Downstairs ran, stables, came near, heard stamp cart-horse, came over. Mark began whistle tune,-- "John Young went town On little pony, Stuck feather his hat, And called Macaroni." "Macaroni!" said he, looked stable-door. "Macaroni" answer; leather harness creaked he moved it. "Macaroni!" shouted Mark. He choose reply nickname. "John!" said Bevis. "Eez--eez," replied man, looking horse's neck, meaning "Yes, yes." "Fetch something us," said Mark. "Pint?" said John laconically. "Two," said Bevis. "Ar-right," ["all right"] said John, his little brown eyes twinkling. "Ar-right, you." For quart ale things he would done: gallon his soul would moment's consideration, stood way. Bell, book, candle shall drive back When pewter tankard beckons come on! They explained wanted do. "Have got grate house?" said Bevis. "A yarth," said John, meaning open hearth. "Burns wood." "Can make hot fire--very hot it?" "Rayther. Boilers." By using bellows. "What could anvil?" "Be going blacksmithing?" "Yes--what anvil?" "Iron quarter," said John. "There is ould iron she would. Shall I take he whoam?" An iron quarter square iron weight weighing 28 pounds: would make useful anvil. It agreed he so, saw put old iron weight, rusty long disused, cart. "If wants anybody blow bellers," said he, "there is Loo-- she will blow yer. Be going ride?" "No," said Bevis; "we will go across fields." Away went meadow foot-path, shorter route little town, reached John his cart. At ironmonger's examined number pipes, iron brass tubes. The brass looked best, tempted them, turning round fancied join showed, perfect, course would do. Nor look strong iron, chose iron, bought five feet stout tube--the best shop--with bore 5-eighths; afterwards brass rod, form ramrod. Brass would spark barrel. John called due course, left his cottage. The old rogue his quart, promise shilling, hearth answered blacksmithing. In evening, Mark, well primed he ask, casually looked blacksmith's hamlet. The blacksmith least surprised; old frequenters; he surprised one before. Mark pulled tools about, lifted sledge stood upright, left it is mark iron "scale" lay ground inch deep. Scale consists minute particles fly red-hot iron hammered--the sparks, fact, which, go out, fall, found metal; like meteors sky, scale shooting Vulcan's anvil, go drop earth. Mark lifted sledge, put down, twisted vice, untwisted it, Jonas, smith, stood blowing bellows his left hand, patting fire forge his little spud shovel. "Find anything want," he said presently. "I will take this," said Mark. "There is sixpence." He chosen bit iron rod, short, thicker ramrod. Bevis told look for. "All right, sir--anything else?" "Well," said Mark, moving towards door, "I do not know,"--then stopping admirable assumption indifference. "Suppose stop one end pipe, it?" "Make white-hot," said smith. "Bring me." "Will white-hot shut tight?" "Quite tight--it runs together hit. Bring me. I say, where is punt?" grinning. His white teeth gleamed his open lips--a row ivory set grimy face. "The punt's bottom," said Mark, louring countenance. "Nice boys," said smith. "You are nice boys. If mine--" He took slender ash plant lying bench, made ply whistle air. Mark tossed his chin, kicked door open, walked off. "I say!--I say!" shouted smith. "Bring me." "Keep yourself," said Mark loftily. Boys indeed! The smith swore, sounded his broad deep chest like noise draught furnace. He angry himself--he thought he lost half-a-crown, least, swishing stick down. If want half-a-crown, must control feelings. Mark told Bevis smith said, went work, evening filed end rod Mark bought. Bevis's plan file till almost fitted tube, quite. Then he meant make tube red-hot--almost white--and insert little block. He knew heat would tube slightly enlarge, block cold could driven in; tube cooled would shrink hold tight, none gas powder could escape. The block driven nearly half inch rim; rim next made quite white-hot, state hammered till met centre, overlapped little. Again made white-hot, overlapping (like paper paper tube doubled in) hammered solidly welded together. The breech would firmly closed, would slightest chance blowing out. This his idea, he explained Mark. They decide long barrel be: bought rather tube wanted. Five, even four feet would long, gun would inconvenient handle, though rest, heavy. In barrel properly built up, thickness gradually decreases breech muzzle, greatest weight nearest shoulder gun balances. But iron tube thickness one end other, consequence, held horizontally, seemed heavy farther extremity. Yet wanted long barrel, else would like proper matchlock. Finally, fixed forty inches, would long, long; barrel three feet four inches ought, considered, able kill great distance. Adding stock, say fifteen inches, total length would four feet seven. Next morning, taking tools portable vice flag-basket, often boat, made detour went John Young's cottage. On door-step sat little girl without shoes stockings; her ragged frock open her neck. At first, she looked twelve years old, original impression age derived height size. In minute two she grew older, less fourteen. The rest family fields work, Loo left wait upon them. Already she huge fire burning hearth, brick; floor brick. With door wide open could hardly stand heat till flames fallen. Bevis want much flame; embers best make iron hot. Taking jackets set work, put tube fire, arranged anvil, screwed vice deal table, which, though quite clean, varnished grease sunk wood, selected hammer thought would suit, told Loo fetch her father's hedging-gloves. These made thick leather, Mark thought he could hold tube better them, would warm one end other. The little block iron, form breech, filed smooth, _not_ fit tube. When tube nearly white-hot, Mark put leather gloves, seized placed colder end anvil, standing tube glowing end upwards. Bevis took iron block, breech-piece, his pincers, inserted white-hot tube, drove smart tap. Some scale fell dropped Mark's shirt-sleeve, burning little holes his skin. He drew his breath his teeth, sudden keen pain sparks, flinch. Bevis hastily threw his jacket Mark's arms, gave block three taps, till flush top tube. By tube cooling, whiteness superseded red, gradually became dull. Mark put tube fire, Loo sent find piece sacking protect his arm sparks. His face safe, he sloped his hat it, hold his head down. There specks his hat scale sparks burnt it. Loo returned sack, Bevis, thinking, discovered way Mark might escape sparks. He pulled table along till vice fixed projected anvil. Next time Mark stand tube upright same, put vice, tighten vice quickly, he need hold it. Bevis short punch drive block breech-piece deeper tube. Loo, blowing embers, her scorched face close fire, declared tube ready. Mark drew out, two seconds fixed vice, colder end contact anvil underneath. Bevis put his punch block tapped sharply till he forced half inch beneath rim. He adjusted next heating himself, he wish end tube hot; he wanted end almost white-hot, rest. While heating went doors cool themselves, leaving Loo blow steadily embers. She watched every motion intent cat mouse; she ran her naked brown feet fetch carry; she smiled Mark put leather gloves, she would held her hands, though much hotter. She would put her arm anvil receive blow hammer; she would gone well bucket asked her. Her mind full wonderful work--what could making? But her heart soul filled great big boys beautiful sparkling eyes white arms, white milk, wilful, imperious ways. How many times she watched afar! To near almost great joy; she like slave feet; regarded her less bellows her hands. Directly tube white-hot extremity, she called them. Mark set tube up; Bevis carefully hammered rim over, folding breech block. Another heating, he hammered yielding metal still closer together, welding folds. A third heating, he finished it, deftly levelling projections. The breech complete, much better done hoped. As cooled tube shrank block; closed end tube shrank too, breech-piece incorporated tube itself. Their barrel indeed far safer breech scores brittle guns turned cheap days. Loo, seeing begin put tools flag-basket, asked, tears her eyes, going more? They nearly three hours, heating took time, seemed ten minutes her. Bevis handed barrel her, told her take great care it; would come night. It necessary smuggle armoury home, could done day. She took it. Had he given charge file soldiers could safer; she would watch bird her nest. Just John came in, partly his luncheon, partly curiosity see getting on. "Picters be!" said John. Pictures were--black grimy, much iron sticks logs, half burnt, handled; were, fact, streaked smudged charcoal. Loo instantly ran bowl water wash, held towel ready. She watched hill, wished kicked her pulled her hair. Other boys did; touch her? They might done so. Next time she thought she would put her naked foot would step it; she cried perhaps would stroke her. In afternoon took two spades boat. The wind fallen usual, rowed New Formosa. The Pinta deep water heavy ballast, moved slowly, long row. Mark cut two sticks, driven face sand cliff, show outline proposed cave. It five feet square, deep could dig it. They cleared away loose sand earth foot minutes, began excavation. The sand outside soft crumbled, inch deep became harder, work anything like easy supposed. After pecking spades whole hour, cut shallow hole. "This good," said Mark; "we shall never like this." "Pickaxes," said Bevis. "Yes; hatchets," said Mark. "We could chop sand best." "So could," said Bevis. "There old hatchets she would; we will sharpen them; they will do." They worked another half-hour, desisted, cutting sticks stuck ground semicircle cliff, mark palisade fixed. The New Sea still calm, row Mozambique way harbour. In evening ground two old hatchets, which, much worn chipped, thrown aside, searched among quantities stored seasoned wood poles piece make stock matchlock. There beech, oak, elm, ash, fir--all sorts wood lying she would workshop. Finally, selected curved piece ash, hard well seasoned. The curve nearly wanted, natural would much stronger. This carried armoury shaved planed shape. At night went barrel. Loo brought it, Bevis, he thought, accidentally stepped her naked foot, crushing his heel stones door. Loo cried out. "O dear!" said he, "I sorry. Here--here is sixpence, I will send pears." She put sixpence her mouth bit it, said nothing. She indented silver her teeth, disappointed he stroked her, she stood watched away. They smuggled barrel armoury, kept carefully locked ever, even put one could see keyhole. In morning, breeze westward, put hatchets board Pinta, sailed away New Formosa. The wind partly favourable, reached island three tacks. The hatchets answered much better, cutting sand well, soon began two holes cliff. They worked little way apart, drilling hole straight in, intending cut away intervening wall afterwards, else could work once. By dinner-time heap excavated sand two large holes. The afternoon evening spent work gun. Mark shaved stock; Bevis filed touch-hole barrel; he would liked drilled touch-hole, he could without borrowing blacksmith's tools, want know about. For four days worked digging cave morning, making matchlock rest day. The stock ready--it simply curved smoothed sand-paper, intended afterwards rub oil, till took little polish like handles axes. The stock almost long barrel, fitted groove it, fastened copper wire ready. Bevis first thought cut mortise handle stock insert lock, consideration he feared would weaken stock, he chiselled place right side lock could counter-sunk. The right side stock purposely left somewhat thicker pan. The pan shallow piece tin screwed stock sunk wood, one end closed, contact barrel touch-hole. In pan priming placed. Another piece tin working pivot formed wire nail (these nails round) cover pan like slide lid, keep priming dropping blown wind. Before firing, lid would pushed aside thumb, outer corner curled like knob thumb-nail press against. The lock trouble, make many trials succeeded. In end formed piece thick iron wire. This twisted round centre, would work axle pivot. It then, heated red-hot, beaten flat nearly, blacksmith's work could home, one could guessed for. One end bent, though fixed side stock, would come underneath trigger, matchlock trigger hammer single piece. The end curved hold match, caused Bevis thought, he could split like match-holders Indian matchlocks he seen cases. Bevis drew several sketches try got it, last twisted end spiral two turns. The match, piece cord prepared burn slowly, inserted spiral, burning end slightly projecting, spiral iron beaten thin, necessary could squeezed thumb finger hold cord tighter, Bevis think would necessary that. Next spring fixed behind, trigger end way hold hammer end up. Pulling trigger pulled spring, moment finger removed hammer sprang up--this keep lighted match away priming till moment firing. The completed lock covered plate brass screwed on, polished till shone brightly. Bevis delighted much difficulty find worked perfectly. The brass ramrod heated one end, enlarged striking red-hot, caused metal bulge, proceeded prove barrel fastening stock. Volume Two, Chapter XI. BUILDING THE HUT. Powder easily got Latten; bought pound loose powder three halfpence ounce. This like black dust, far pure, little flashed paper white wood leaves broad smudge, answered purpose well. While Bevis fretting fuming lock, he got white-hot impatience, though he would it, Mark made powder-horn sawing pointed end cow's horn, fitting plug wood mouth. For shot used bag, bought mould bullets. The charger measure powder brass drawn cartridge-case, two Mark chanced put his pocket Jack's. It held charge, scratched line inside show far filled. At night barrel got house, taken meadows, three fields away, mound chosen best place. Mark brought lantern, light till arrived, put behind bushes, light show distance. The barrel charged three measures powder two shot rammed firm, placed ground front tree. From touch-hole train powder laid along dry ground round tree, gun could fired gunner completely protected case breech blew out. A piece tar-cord inserted long stick split end. Mark wished fire train, lit tar-cord, burned well, he stood back far he could dropped match powder. Puff--bang! They ran forward, found barrel right. The shot scored groove along mound lost earth; barrel kicked back tree, burst bulged, felt would safe shoot with. Such thickness metal, indeed, would withstood much greater strain, barrel, rude was, far safer many flimsy guns. The last thing made rest. For staff found straight oak rod lumber-room, used curtain-rod old-fashioned four-poster. Black age hard rigid, still strong; thing rest. The fork barrel lie difficulty, till Bevis hit plan forming two pieces thick iron wire. These beaten flat one end, hole bored top staff, two pieces wire driven side side, flatness prevented moving. The wires drawn apart hammered bent half-circle stock would rest. The staff high enough shoot standing, afterwards shortened, found best aim kneeling one knee. When barrel fastened stock twisting copper wire round, really looked like gun, jumped danced bench-room till floor shook. After handling time took pieces, hid till cave ready, long weapon could got house easily, except sections. Not great previously felt must account touch gunpowder, yet handled prepared shoot without least hesitation. The idea grown gradually. Had come would rejected, grown imperceptibly become accustomed it, never questioned doing. Absorbed details labour constructing matchlock, thinking patience, many trials, constant effort worn away every consideration success. The labour made object legitimate. They gloried gun, fact, though heavy, real weapon capable shooting, many battle olden times better. Bevis still making experiments, soaking cord various compositions saltpetre, discover best slow match. By cave began look like cave, every morning, sailing rowing New Formosa, chopped two three hours hard sand. This cave Mark's idea, started work Bevis became eager he, toiled like miners. After two headings driven five feet, cut away intervening wall, cavern five feet square, large enough sit in. They intended dig much deeper, work hard, and, worse that, slow, matchlock ready anxious get island. So decided cave large enough store-room, lived hut, put entrance. Bevis drew sketch hut several times, trying find easiest way constructing it. The plan selected insert long poles sand three feet higher top cave. These placed foot apart; nine them, stuck holes made purpose row, thus covering space eight feet wide eight high. From cliff rafters slope downwards till lower outward ends six feet ground. That would give roof fall two feet case rain. Two stout posts put long beam across, outer ends rafters rest. Two lesser posts middle mark doorway. The roof covered brushwood thickness, thatched sedges reed-grass. The walls meant make hurdles stood end, fastened tar-cord upright stakes. Outside hurdles intended pile furze, brushwood, faggots, bundles sedges--anything, short. A piece old carpeting close door curtain. The store-room five feet square, hut would eight, two thought plenty space. The semi-circular fence palisade starting cliff one side, coming other, hut radius ten yards, enclose good piece ground, could fire cook food secure wild beasts savages. A gateway fence wide enough squeeze through, closed two boards nailed frame. It took time settle details, Bevis would begin till he got everything complete his mind, actual work occupy nearly long digging cave. There plenty poles growing island, Mark cut Bevis's hatchet, blunt ones used excavating, one he chopped trees Peninsula. As Mark cut down, ash, willow, alder, Bevis stripped twigs billhook, shortened proper length. All poles ready one morning, afternoon coming set two stout corner posts. Next day rafters fitted, bring short ladder get cliff mouth cave. Then hurdles brought set up, brushwood cut thrown top. Sedges grew quantities end island, ground sloped till became level water. In cutting took care leave outer fringe standing, one passed, chance looked way shore, he see sedges reaped. They covered roof two feet thick brushwood, sedges, reed-grass, considered enough keep ordinary shower. Of course tornadoes common tropical countries come must creep inner cave. Against fearful storms thatch could put would protect them. The walls took whole day finish, required quantity brushwood, fastened place rods, thrust ground, tied top outside rafters. At last hut finished, could stand up, walk it; carpet-curtain dropped, dark, forgotten make window. But daytime would want one, curtain could thrown aside, doorway would let plenty light, faced south. At night would lantern hung roof. "It is splendid," said Mark; "we could live years." "Till forgot day was, whether Monday Saturday," said Bevis. "And beards grow waists." Their chins smooth possible. "Ships would sent search us." "And come home everybody would come see us," said Mark. "Just think wonders shall tell them!" "I wish Ted could see it," said Bevis, "and Charlie, Val." "Would not jealous knew," said Mark. "They would kill us let come too." "It is great secret," said Bevis; "we must careful. There may mines gold island, do not see." "Diamonds." "There is pearl fishery, I am sure." "Birds Paradise." "Spices magic things." "It is wonderful island ever found out." "Hurrah!" "Let us sail." "So will." "Not work afternoon." "No; let us sail farther--" "Beyond island?" "Yes; unknown seas, do not know. Come on." Away ran Pinta. The wind lately blown lightly east, continued day. These light easterly summer breezes delight watch corn, mean fine weather full wheat-ears. Mark took tiller, sailed southwards channel, New Formosa Serendib. Not far beyond, Bevis, looking side, saw sunken punt. She lying six seven feet water, white streak her gunwale could clearly seen. He told Mark. "I hope governor will not get her yet," said Mark. "Lucky he is busy--" "Why?" "Do not see," said shrewd Mark, "while punt's bottom nobody come island see we are at." "Ah!" said Bevis. "What jolly good thing I shipwrecked." As went southwards passed several small islands sandbanks, every summer snipe flew circled round them, water, returning spot. "Those Coral Isles," said Bevis. "They are surface." "Tornadoes would sweep right them," said Mark. "That is cocoa-nut trees." Another sandbank way left named Grey Crow Island, grey hooded crow rose it. "Do see weeds?" said Mark presently. "You know that is sign land." "Some," said Bevis, looking side ripples. "They brown water; I suppose it is deep come top." The light breeze carried along pleasantly, though slowly. "Swallows," said Bevis; "I see swallows, high up, there. That is another sign land." "Heave lead," said Mark. "We have forgotten it; stupid! Mind remember next time." New Formosa long way rear now. "That is Pearl Island," said Mark, pointing larger sandbank. "Cannot see shells glistening; it is mother-of-pearl." "So is." The crows carried mussels islet, left shells strewn about. The inner part reflected sunlight. If examined closely prismatic colours. "There is curious wave," said Mark, standing pointing undulation water side small patch green weeds. The undulation went away till lost sight it. "What it?" "There sorts curious things tropic seas," said Bevis. "Some found even yet. Nobody tell is." "Perhaps it is magic," said Mark. "Lots magic goes south," said Bevis. "I believe we are nearly equator; feel hot gunwale is,"--the wood warm sunshine--"and sun goes overhead every day, it is so, light night. We bring astrolabe take observation--I say!" The Pinta brought sudden jerk. They run shoal. "Wrecked!" shouted Mark joyfully. "But waves. It is good ripples." Bevis pushed Pinta scull, feeling bottom, told Mark ease tiller sail right. Two minutes afterwards grounded again, pushed off. On left, eastern side, saw broad channel leading weeds. Bevis told Mark tack there. Mark so, slowly advanced weeds side. The tacks short, wind light made little progress. Presently channel turned south; ran faster; next turned sharp east, came back. In trying tack Mark ran weeds. "Stupe!" said Bevis. "That I am not," said Mark. "You cannot it." "Cannot I?" said Bevis contemptuously. "Try then," said Mark, he left tiller. Bevis took managed two tacks well. At third he ran weeds, fact channel narrow time get weigh ship. "Stupe yourself," said Mark. He tried row out, every time he got pull wind blew back, let mainsail down. "It wants canoe," said Bevis. "Of course does. It is use going unless you are going row." "No; look!" Bevis pointed small branch floating slowly past them. "There is current," said Mark. "River," said Bevis. "In sedges somewhere." "What it? I know; it is Orinoco." "No, I do not think so." "Amazon?" "No." "Hoang-Ho?" "How tell, till get astrolabe take observation? Most likely it is new river, biggest ever found." "It must new river," said Mark. "This New Sea. We are drifting back little." "We will come canoe, something," said Bevis. They rowed channel, set mainsail, sailed back, past Pearl Island, Grey Crow Island, Coral Isles, approached New Formosa. Mark looked side, watched see sunken punt. "It is wreck," said he presently, passed punt. "She foundered." "It is Spanish galley," said Bevis. "She is full bullion, gold silver--" "Millions broad gold pieces." "Doubloons." "Pistoles." "Ingots." "You see skeletons chained oar-benches." "Yes--just went down." "There strange sounds night." "Bubbles come up, shouts, awful shrieks." "Hope shall not hear we are hut." "No; it is far." They sailed New Formosa Serendib, homewards Mozambique harbour. The east wind, like west, there-and-back wind, could reach island, return it, two three tacks, sometimes one stretch. Volume Two, Chapter XII. PROVISIONING THE CAVE. Next day took iron bar them, pitched stakes fence stockade. Between stakes wove willow rods brushwood, thus bound together, much stronger looked, one could got without least making great noise. The two boards, nailed together gate, fastened one side stouter stake small chains like rude hinges. On staple small padlock. "It is finished," said Mark, he turned key locked in. "No," said Bevis, "there is bedstead. The ground's dry," (it sand), "but it is proper sleep ground." They put preparing bedstead till next day, approached spanking south east wind--half breeze--against tack indeed, spun along good speed. The waves large enough make Pinta roll, spray came then. "It is almost shipwreck weather," said Mark. "Just see--" He pointed cliff little splashing, waves swept sideways along base cliff. "If run her cliff bowsprit knocked in. Would mast go board?" "Not enough wind," said Bevis, he steered past, landed usual place. The bedstead made placing five six thick poles sawn four feet floor left side hut, like sleepers railway. Across lengthways laid lesser rods, still slender rods crossways, boughs spruce fir, one foot depth. The framework logs rods beneath kept bed ground, boughs spruce fir, full resinous sap, gave slight fragrance. On mattress rug old great-coats thrown, meant cover rugs coats. The bedstead took much room, would answer daytime instead chairs sit on. "It is finished now, then," said Mark. "Quite finished," said Bevis. "All bring things." "And get wrecked," said Mark. "These chips boughs," pointing heap cut poles stakes, "will fire. Come on. Let us go look cliff dashed pieces." They climbed cliff young oak summit, went edge. The firm sand bore safely verge. "It looks deep," said Bevis. "The sand goes straight." "Fathomless," said Mark. "Just think awful. It ought happen night--pitch black! I know! Some savages ought light fire guide us destruction." "We could scramble cliff water--I mean swim." "Of course shall swim, clinging oars." "Then must get round corner, somehow." "The side weeds; would not do." "Very likely waves would bang us cliff. Do not remember Ulysses clung rock?" "His hands torn." "Nearly drowned." "Tired out." "Thumped breathless." "Jolly!" "But I say! There is one thing we have forgotten," said Bevis. "If smash ship cliff like she will go bottom--" "Well, that is want." "Ah, it is like rocks shoals; she will go straight down, right cannot get her--" "All better." "But things go too--gun, powder, provisions, everything." "Put island first wreck afterwards." "So could. Yes, could that, then," said Bevis, imagining would happen, "when Pinta missed harbour come back, would search, would think something happened us." "I see," said Mark, "that is awkward. What trouble get wrecked! Why cannot people let us jolly?" "They must come looking us," said Bevis, "else spoil everything." "Perhaps better put wreck off," said Mark, dejected tone. "Do island first, wreck afterwards." "It seems must," said Bevis, "and it is almost awkward--" "Why?" "We shall come Pinta, yet must keep her here, else she missed." "The ship must home too." "Yes," said Bevis; "she must New Formosa equator home harbour. It is difficult thing." "Awfully difficult," said Mark. "But it. Try! Think! Shall I tickle you?" "It wants magic," said Bevis. "I ought studied magic more; magic books now." "But think, I know. Now, think hard--_hard_." "First," said Bevis slowly, tracing proceedings his imagination; "first must bring things--the gun powder, provisions, great-coats, astrolabe, spears, leave here." "Pan ought come," said Mark, "to watch hut." "So he did; he shall come, besides, shoot wild duck he swim fetch it." "Now go on," said Mark. "First, bring everything Pan." "Tie up," said Bevis, "and row home boat. Then thing is, get island?" "Swim," said Mark. "Too far." "But need not swim New Sea. Could not swim landed night battle?" "Ever much better. Let us go look," said Bevis. Away went shore side island, saw moment far. It two hundred yards sedges bank landed night. They could trust swim fifty sixty yards; was, too, risk weeds, might get entangled. "I know!" said Bevis, "I know! You stop island Pan. I will sail Pinta harbour, I will paddle back catamaran." "There!" said Mark, "I knew could thought hard. We could bring catamaran boat, leave sedges ready." "I leave half clothes island," said Bevis, "and tie rest back, paddle sedges ten minutes. That like savages do." "I shall come too," said Mark. "I shall not stop here. Let Pan tied up, I will paddle well." "The catamaran will not bear two." "Get another. There is lots planks. I come--it is much jollier paddling sitting nothing." "Capital," said Bevis. "We will two catamarans, paddle together." "First-rate. Let us quick get things island." "There lot," said Bevis. "The matchlock, powder, flour, and--" "Salt," said Mark. "Do not remember moorhen. Things nice without salt." "Yes, salt matches, pots cooking, lantern, and--" "Ever many cargoes," said Mark. "As there is lot, cannot go home fetch anything it is forgotten, had not better write list?" "So I will," said Bevis. "The pots kettles bother, want know going do." "Buy new ones." "Right; leave Macaroni's." "Come on. Sail home begin." They launched Pinta, spanking south-easterly breeze carried swiftly harbour. At home small parcel, neatly done up, addressed "Captain Bevis." "That is Frances's handwriting," said Mark. Bevis cut string found flag inside made broad red ribbon cut point. "It is pennant," said Bevis. "It capitally. How never thought flag before?" "We busy," said Mark. "Girls nothing do, remember sort stitched things." "She shall bird paradise her hat," said Bevis. "We shall sure shoot one island." "I should not give her," said Mark. "I sell it. Look money." In evening took large box (which locked) boat, carrying courtyard lid open--ostentatiously open--and left board. Next morning filled tools. Bevis kept his list pencil him, put one thing suggested another, he immediately wrote down. There files, gimlets, hammers, screw-drivers, planes, chisels, portable vice, six seven different sorts nails, every tool indeed had. The hatchet saw already island. Besides coils wire cord, balls string, several boxes safety lucifer matches. This enough one cargo, shut lid, began loosen sails ready hoisting. "You might take us once." "You never asked us." Tall Val little Charlie come along bank unnoticed busy. "I wish would go away," said Mark, beginning push Pinta afloat. The ballast cargo made her drag sand. "Bevis," said Val, "let us one sail." "All times you have sailing," said Charlie, "and yourselves, never asked anybody." "And banged battle," said Val. "If beat us, hit hard could." "It capital battle," said Bevis hesitatingly. He halyard his hand, paused mainsail half hoisted. "Whopping snopping," said Charlie. "Charging whooping holloaing," said Val. "Rare," said Bevis. "Yes; fought well." "But never asked us sail." "Not once--you did not." "Well, it is ship. It is ship," said Mark, giving another push, till Pinta nearly afloat. "Stop," cried Charlie, running water's edge. "Bevis, take us--" "It is selfish you," said Val, following. "So is," said Bevis. "I say, Mark--" "Pooh!" said Mark, violent shove he launched boat, leaped board. He took scull, began row her head round. The wind north light. "I bate you," said Charlie. "I believe you are something. What is box." "Ballast, donk," said Mark. "That is not, I saw shut lid. It is ballast." "Let us let come," said Bevis irresolutely. "You awful stupe," said Mark, his breath. "They will spoil everything." "And always sail one way?" said Val. "We have seen ever many times." "I will not watched," said Bevis angrily: he, unconsciously, endeavoured excuse his selfishness rage. "You cannot help it." "I tell you, I will not." "You are General Caesar now." "I hate you," pulling mainsail. Mark took rope fastened it; Bevis sat tiller. "You are beast," screamed little Charlie, sails drew boat began move: north wind aft. "I never thought selfish," shouted Val. "Go on--I will not ask again." "Take that," said Charlie, "and that--and that." He threw three stones, one other, his might: third, rising surface water, struck Pinta's side sharply. "Are not horrid?" he said Val. "I never saw anything like it," said Val. "But we will pay out, somehow." On boat, Bevis looked back presently, saw still standing water's edge. "It is pity," he said; "Mark, I do not like it: shall them?" "How we? Of course would spoil everything; would tell everybody, could never it; and, besides, new island would new island, everybody there." "No would." "We take afterwards--after we have done island. That well." "So will. They watch us, though." "It is nasty watch us," said Mark. "Why take sails watch us?" "I hate watched," said Bevis. "They make everything nasty us can," said Mark; "and shall cunning ever be." "We it, though, somehow." "That will." The light north wind wafted Pinta gently New Sea: red pennant, fluttering mast, pointed course them. They disposed first cargo store-room, cave, placing tools sack, though cave dry box, might least chance rusting. The return voyage slow, work wind, light speed. They looked Charlie Val, gone. Another cargo ready late afternoon. They carried things flag-basket, and, filling box, took care look round behind she would sculls kept, lest one spying. Hitherto worked freely, without doubt suspicion: constantly watch, suspected every tree concealing one. Bevis chafed this, grew angry it. In filling box, too, kept lid towards shore, hoisted mainsail form screen. Mark took care salt, several bags flour, two biscuits, got whole tinful house. He remembered pepper too, overlooked mustard. They took several tins condensed milk. From side bacon, attic, cut three streaky pieces, bought sherry inn; thought took one bottles house, would missed, servants would blamed. Some wine would good mix water; though meant take wooden bottle ale, knew would keep. Then pound tea, perhaps more; took chest, shovelled like sand, hands full once. A bundle old newspapers tied up, light fire; found, experience, easy dry grass. Bevis hunted till he discovered tin mug he he little boy, two tin plates. Mark brought another mug. A knives forks would never missed basketful kitchen; and, choosing spoons, careful take silver, silver counted every evening. They asked could small zinc bucket boat; got it, put three pounds knob sugar it, loose; covered Turkish bathing-towels, wrapped brush comb. Just start, remembered soap candles. To get things together, Pinta, took hours, often wait awhile till people way could get cupboards. In afternoon, knew, people went upstairs dress, opportunity. By time landed, stowed away cargo, sun declining. Volume Two, Chapter XIII. MORE CARGOES--ALL READY. Next morning third cargo went; row, New Sea calm. It consisted arms. Bevis's favourite bow, course, taken, two sheaves arrows; Mark's spears harpoon; crossbow, throw-sticks, boomerang darts; armoury almost denuded. Besides fish-hooks (which put box), fishing-rods, kettles; old horn-lantern, old telescope, astrolabe, scissors thread (which shipwrecked people always have); bag full old coins, found sand shore, Spanish galleon wrecked (one sunken galley convoying tornado overtook them); small looking-glass, piece iron rod, six bottles lemonade, cribbage-board pack cards, bezique pack; basket apples, bag potatoes. The afternoon cargo clothes, thought might want change wet; took one suit, carefully selecting old things disused, would missed. Then great-coats bed; awkward get boat, caused many journeys, could take one coat time. "What lot rubbish taking boat," said mamma once. "Mind do not sink it: fill boat rubbish till cannot move about." "Rubbish!" said Bevis indignantly. "Rubbish, indeed!" They often took rugs need conceal them. Mark hit good idea rolled barrel matchlock one rugs, ramrod. In hid stock powder-horn, got boat; chuckling Mark's device, removed matchlock broad daylight. "If Val's watching," said Bevis, came bank rugs, last part load, "he will smashed." "People spy ought killed," said Mark. "Everything ought done openly," carefully depositing concealed barrel stern-sheets. This important thing all. When got matchlock safe cave, felt greatest difficulty surmounted. John Young brought anvil, 28 pound weight, bank, shipped. He bought small pot boiling, smallest size made, Latten, also saucepan, tin kettle, teapot. One wooden bottles, like tiny barrels, used send ale men fields, filled strong ale. Mark drew cellar his prison, carefully filling utmost, John got away rolled his jacket. The all-potent wand enchanter Barleycorn held him; he would done them? He ready oblige since Mark's imprisonment cellar, Bevis Mark rather taken his part Bailiff, got scrapes. Feeling he powerful friends court, John trouble work hard. They called cottage pot things, sack ready them. Loo fetched sack, Bevis threw his shoulder. "I scoured well," said Loo. "They clean." "Did you?" said Bevis. "Here," searching his pocket. "O! I have fourpenny piece left." He gave her. "I cook," said Loo wistfully, "and make tea." This hint take her them; away strode unheeding. The tin kettle teapot clashed sack. "I believe I saw Val behind tree," said Bevis. "He cannot see sack though," said Mark. The wind still light, morning occupied delivering cargo. The cave store-room crammed full, could put without shelves. "That is last," said Mark, dragging heavy anvil in. "Except Pan." "And books," said Bevis, "and ink paper. We must keep journal course." "So must," said Mark. "I forgot that. It make book." "`Adventures New Formosa,'" said Bevis. "We will write every evening we have done work, do not see." When got home he put his books together--the Odyssey, Don Quixote, grey battered volume ballads, tiny little book Shakespeare's poems, he lately become fond, Filmore's rhymed translation Faust. He found two manuscript books journal; pens ink-bottle could go together final cargo Pan. All voyages proceeding thinking get away home without searched for, concluded almost excuse could make would going spend week two Jack. This began spread about, pretended prepare visit. As expected, caused comment. All said stop long. Mamma, much like idea left herself, quite different away disgrace. But she insisted upon Bevis writing home. Bevis shrugged his shoulders, foreseeing would difficult post-office New Formosa; use, she said he go unless he promised write. "Very well," said Bevis. "Letters stupidest stupidity stupes ever invented." But arose new difficulty, seemed could got over. How tell away island, cut communication mainland, going home; whether right supposed Jack's, whether missed? For though intent deceiving home authorities, ingenious devising means, stopped this. They like think perhaps Bevis's governor mamma, kind, would miserable anxiety finding disappeared. Mark, too, anxious his Jolly Old Moke. With usual contradiction mind earnestly set deceive friends, equally anxious give pain. After trouble, really seemed would prevent realisation plans. A whole day walked wondered could do, got quite angry simple irritation. At last settled must arrange one know, trouble meant return immediately. Both agreed little Charlie best could choose; he quick lightning, true steel. "Just remember," said Bevis, "how he fetched Cecil battle." "That made difference," said Mark. "Now I will manage him; do not come, leave me; you are soft--" "Soft!--Well, I like that." "No; I do not mean stupid--so easy. There, do not look like that. You tell me--you think Charlie must do--and I will manage him." Bevis thought considered Charlie must give signal--wave handkerchief. Charlie must stand conspicuous place visible New Formosa; quarry would place, certain fixed time every day, wave white handkerchief, could look telescope see him. If anything wrong, he could take his hat wave instead. Mark thought would well, set find arrange Charlie. Being much offended he taken sail, Charlie first off-hand, disposed anything. But shrewd Mark let great secret he Bevis going live wood end New Sea like savages, Charlie began relent, his sympathies went idea. Mark promised faithfully he Bevis done first, he come he would help them. Charlie gave agreed, condition he taken sail first. Eager Mark island, good trying persuade Charlie, he adhered his stipulation, Mark yield. However, he reflected took Charlie sail he would certain he promised, besides would make Val jealous, he Charlie would quarrel, would always watching. So settled--Charlie sail, every afternoon four of the clock he stand quarry wave white handkerchief right. If Bevis Mark missed he take his hat, wave that. As he watch, Charlie judge time calling cows milked--the milkers make great hullabaloo shouting, heard long distance off. "I said going live wood," Mark told Bevis he came back. "Then he will not think we are island. If he plays us trick he will go try find us wood." While Mark gone signal, Bevis, thinking everything over, remembered letter he promised write home. To post letter one must go mainland, day one would likely see mention it, question would arise came near without going home? Bevis went cottage, told Loo listen every evening ten of the clock her window, looked field back, she heard anybody whistle three notes, "Foo-tootle-too," slip out, would them. "That I will," said Loo, delighted. "I will come minute." Charlie his sail next morning, took care go near island. Knowing sharp his eyes were, tacked fro Mozambique Fir-Tree Gulf. Charlie learned manage foresail five minutes, tiller, please let act captain while. He promised faithfully make signal every day, knew he would it. In afternoon thought thought see anything forgotten, try call things mind, wandered house, recollected one thing--the gridiron. There several kitchen. They took old one, much burnt, used. With Bevis's books visited New Formosa, rowing towards evening, upon return unshipped mast, took sails home, else perhaps Val one would launch Pinta try sail absence. They meant padlock boat chain, sails her would temptation break lock. There nothing take Pan, eager morning past midnight could go sleep. The morning 3rd August--the day Columbus sailed--the long desired day, beautifully fine, calm, cloudless. They haste start could hardly say "Good-bye." "Good-bye," said Polly dairymaid. "Do not want see you," said Bevis. Polly yet forgiven part she taken hustling Mark cellar. They got meadow Pan, Bevis's mother came running after. "Have money?" she asked, her purse her hand. They laughed, thought instantly struck could spend money New Formosa, say want any. She gave five shillings each, kissed again. She watched till went gateway Pan, hidden sight. Pan leaped board them, rowed island. It still, surface like glass. The spaniel ran inside stockade, sniffed knowingly coats bedstead, he wag his tail look happy Bevis suddenly drew his collar three holes tighter buckled it. Bevis knew well his collar tight possible Pan would work his head out. They fastened securely post gateway palisade, hastened away. When Pan realised really gone, heard sound oars, he went quite frantic. He tugged, he whined, he choked, he rolled over, he scratched, bit, shook, whimpered; tears ran his eyes, his ears pulled his head collar, he strained. But he strained vain. They heard his dismal howls almost Mozambique. "Poor Pan!" said Bevis. "He shall feast first thing shoot." They left stockings island, everything else could take large bundles backs paddling, took pocket-knives trouser's pockets left them, knowing things apt drop pockets. The Pinta drawn far she would come shore harbour, fastened chain, ready, staple padlocked. Mark thought this, one could go rowing round, he piece string key he fastened button-hole his waistcoat might lost. This done, got hedge, retraced way come home night battle, meadows, cornfields, lastly across wild waste pasture common. From scrambled hedges immense bramble thickets, regained shore opposite island. They went marshy level bank, along beds sedges, where, verge sea, hidden catamarans. There undressed, made clothes boots bundles, slung shoulders cord. Then hauled catamarans water. Volume Two, Chapter XIV. NEW FORMOSA. Splash! "Is deep?" "Not yet." Bevis got his catamaran ran way, water shallow, till deepened, he sat astride paddled. "Come on," he shouted. Splash! "I am coming." Mark ran his manner, sitting astride paddled ten yards behind. "Weeds," said Bevis, feeling long rough stalks like string dragging his feet. "Where? I cannot see." "Under water. They hurt." "There goes flapper," (a young wild duck). "I hope shall not see magic wave." "Pooh!" "My bundle slipping." "Pull again." "It is right now." "Holloa! Land," said Bevis, suddenly standing up. He reached shallow water deeper his knees. "A jack struck. There," said Mark, he stood up, drew his catamaran along his hand. Splash! Bevis again, paddling deeper water. Mark close behind. "There is coot; he is gone sedges." "Parrots," said Mark, two wood-pigeons passed over. "Which right channel?" said Bevis, pausing. They reached great mass weeds came surface, impossible move. There two channels, one appeared lead straight island, wound right. "Which come Pinta, hid catamarans?" said Mark. "Stupe, that is I want know." "Go straight on," said Mark; "that looks clearest." So did, Bevis went straight on; paddled fifty yards saw could go much farther way, channel curved sharply, blocked weeds. "We must go back," said Mark. "We cannot turn round." "We cannot paddle backwards. There I am weeds." "Turn round plank." "Perhaps I shall fall off." "Sit sideways first." "The plank tips." "Very well, I will first," said Bevis. He turned sideways try get astride, looking way. The plank immediately tipped pitched water, bundle all. "Ah!" said Mark. "Thought could easy; did not you?" Bevis threw his right arm plank, tried get it; every time he attempted lift his knee over, catamaran gave way him. His paddle floated away. The bundle clothes his back, soaked heavy, kept down. Mark paddled towards him, tried lift one hand, nearly upset himself. Bevis struggled hard get on, pushed plank sideways edge weeds. He felt rough strings winding round his feet. "You will weeds," said Mark, growing alarmed. "Come plank. Try. I will throw bundle off." He began take his back. "Then keep up. O!" Bevis put his hands up, immediately sank surface, he done purposely, free his bundle. The bundle floated, cord slipped his head. Bringing his hands Bevis instantly rose surface, bumping his head catamaran. "Now I it," he said, blowing water his nostrils. He seized plank, laid almost along water, press lightly it, his weight supported water, he got his knee sat up. "Hurrah!" The bundle slowly settling Mark seized it. "Never mind things wet," he said. "Sit still; I will fetch paddle." Dragging bundle water cord, Mark went after, recovered Bevis's paddle. To come back he back water, found awkward even short distance. The catamaran would go straight. "O! stupe I was," said Bevis. "I have got way again." In his hurry he forgotten his object, got astride facing island before. "Well, I never," said Mark. "Stop--do not." Bevis slipped his catamaran again, time encumbered bundle he half minute, faced mainland. "There," said he. "Now come close. That is it. Now give bundle." Mark so. Afterwards Bevis took cord his bundle, water heavy. "Now turn." Mark slipped off, managed his chest still plank. In position he worked round got astride way. "Done well," said Bevis; "ever much better I did. Here." Mark slung his bundle, paddled back shallow water, Bevis towing his soaked dress. They stood shallow rested minutes, Bevis fastened his bundle his plank front he sat. "Come on." Off he went again, following channel time. It wound round bank grown sedges, led straight broader open channel, come boat. They recognised directly, paddled faster. "Hark! there is Pan," said Mark. As came near island, Pan either scented heard splashing, he set his bark again. He choked silent before. "Pan! Pan!" shouted Bevis, whistling. Yow--wow--wow! "Hurrah!" "Hurrah!" They ran shore New Formosa, began dance caper, kicking heels. Yow-wow--wow-wow! "Pan! I am coming," said Bevis, began run, stopped suddenly. Thistles grass trailing briars stayed him. He put his wet boots, picking his way round, reached hut. He let Pan loose. The spaniel crouched his feet whimpered, followed him, crawling ground. Bevis patted him, he could leap usual, desertion quite broken his spirit time. Bevis went hut, he was, nothing his boots, took his journal wrote "Wednesday." "There," said he Mark, come, slowly, he carried two bundles, "there, I have put day, else shall lose reckoning, do not see." They soon dressed. Bevis put change he provided store-room, spread his wet clothes dry sun. Pan crept one other; he could get enough patting, he wanted continually spoken stroked. He would go yard them. "What is time?" said Bevis, "my watch stopped." The water stopped it. "Five minutes twelve," said Mark. "You must write down, `We landed island noon.'" "So I to-night. My watch will not go; water it." "Lucky mine got wet too." "Hang hut, else perhaps get stopped somehow, shall not know time." Mark hung his watch hut, caught sight wooden bottle. "The first thing people refresh themselves," he said. "Let us glass ale: splendid thing you are shipwrecked--" "A libation gods," said Bevis. "That is thing; pour ground you have escaped." "O!" said Mark, opening bottle. "Now look! And I filled brim I could hardly get cork in." "John," said Bevis. "The rascal." "Ships' provisions always scamped," said Bevis; "somebody steals half, puts rotten biscuits. It is quite proper. Why, there is quart gone." John Young, carrying heavy bottle, could resist taking cork see full was. And his mouth large. "Here is mug," said Mark, turned heap things found tin cup. They cupful. "Matchlock," said Bevis. "Matchlock," said Mark. For drank eyes gun-barrel. "Pliers," said Bevis, taking up. "Here is wire; I want pliers." It easy find pliers heap things. "Store-room's muddle," said Mark. "Put right," said captain. "I have got it." Bevis put barrel stock, began twisting copper wire round fasten on. Mark searched powder-horn shot-bag. Three strands twisted neatly firmly round barrel stock--one near breech, one half-way up, third near muzzle. It secure. "It looks like real gun now," said Mark. "Put finger touch-hole," said Bevis. Mark so, he blew barrel. "I feel air," said Mark; "the barrel clear. Shall I measure powder?" "Yes." Bevis shut pan, Mark poured charge horn inserted wad paper, Bevis rammed home brass ramrod. Bow-wow--bow-yow! Up jumped Pan, leaped them, tore round hut, stood doorway barked, ran little way out, came back door, where, his head his shoulder, beckoning follow, he barked his loudest. "It is gun," said Mark. Pan forgot his trouble sound ramrod. Next shot put in, priming pan. A piece match cord prepared burn slowly, foot half long, wound round handle stock, end brought forward spiral hammer. Mark struck match lit it. "What shall shoot at?" said Bevis, went door. Pan rushed disappeared bramble bushes, startling pair turtle-doves hawthorn. "Parrakeets," said Mark. "They are smaller parrots; cannot shoot flying matchlock. There is beech; shoot that." The sunshine fell one side trunk beech, lighting smooth bark. They walked till thought near enough, planted staff rest ground. Bevis put matchlock it, pushed lid pan open his thumb, aimed tree. He pulled trigger; match descended powder pan, went puff! The report followed directly. "Never kicked bit," said Bevis, sulphury smoke rose; barrel heavy kick. "Hit!" shouted Mark, run tree. "Forty dozen shots everywhere." Bevis came gun, saw bark dotted shot. He measured distance back rest left standing ground, pacing steadily. "Thirty-two yards." "My turn," said Mark. The explosion extinguished match, shutting pan-lid loaded gun again. Before Mark shot, Bevis went tree, fastened small piece paper bark pin. Mark fired put three shots paper. Pan raced circled round find game, returned his back covered cleavers stuck his coat. After shooting three times thought would try bullets, ball could nothing. Four times fired beech missed it, though every time took careful aim. "The staff's high," said Mark, "I am sure that is it. We ought kneel, would steadier." Bevis cut staff shorter, without difficulty, old black oak hard like iron. The next Mark's turn. He knelt one knee, aimed deliberately, ball scored trunk, making groove along bark. Bevis tried missed, Mark next time; Bevis fired, missed. "That is enough," said Bevis; "I shall not shooting bullets." "But I hit once." "But did not hit twice." "You never hit once." "It wants top-sight," said Bevis, well pleased. "Nobody shoot ball without sight." "You cannot put one," said Mark. "I do not know." The sight defect weapon; fasten know. "I hit without sight," said Mark. "Chance." "That was not." "It is time dinner, I am sure," said Bevis. "The gun put away now. I will take in; get sticks fire." "O! well," said Mark shortly. "But there is plenty sticks inside stockade!" He followed Bevis began make pile enclosed courtyard. Bevis left gun hut came helped silently. "It is hot here." "Awful!" "Tropics." "The sun's overhead." "Sun-stroke." "The fire ought made shadow." "There is shadow here." "Let us go wood then." "Very well--under beech." They went out, collected heap sticks shade beech shooting. Mark lit fire; Bevis sat beech watched flame rise. "Pot," he said. "Pot--what?" said Mark, still sulky. "Fetch water." "What?" "Fetch water." "O! I am Polly." "But I am captain." "Hum!" However, Mark fetched pot, filled shore, presently came back it, put on. Then he sat shade. "You have finished," said Bevis. "What else?" "What else; bacon." "Get yourself." "Are not going?" "No." Bevis went hut, cut slice bacon, put on. Mark went hut, fetched handful biscuits two apples, began eat them. "You never brought any," said Bevis. "You never ordered me, captain." "Why cannot agreeable?" "Why cannot ask anybody, something yourself, too." "Do not stupe," said Bevis, "so I will. But get biscuit, do." At Mark fetched bag him. "We shall wait long time dinner," he said. "They are jolly one home." "While they are home comfortable we are island seven thousand miles anywhere." "Savages round." "Magic things." "If knew, would not state." "Ships fitted find us. But would know way sail." "No charts." "Nothing." "Never find us. I say, get fork try bacon." "Do not look done." "Put sticks on. I say; forgot potatoes." "O! bother. It is hot; do not let us any. Let us sit still." "Right." Pan looked one other, ran round came back, went underwood came again, finding use, gun really put aside, he presently settled like shade, far enough fire feel heat it. "Oaks banyans, are not they?" said Mark. "They used be, know," remembering exploration wood. "Banyans," said Bevis. "What beeches?" "O! teak." "That is China; are not far China?" "Ask presently I have got astrolabe." "What elms? Stop, I remember; elms!" "How know?" "Did not I go round island one day? Besides, could see were, cliff." "So could; elms. That shows different country country ever found." "Poplars?" said Mark interrogative tone. "Palms, course. You see miles away like palms desert." "Pictures," said Mark. "Yes, that is it. You always see sun going down, camels long shadows, palm-trees. Then I suppose it is Africa?" "You must wait till taken observation. We shall see stars." "Firs?" said Mark. "They are cedars, course." "Of course. Willows blue gums." "Then it is near Australia. I expect is; because, do not know, animals Australia except kangaroos, none all. So it is sort country." "But tigers reeds." "Ah, I forgot them." "Huge boa-constrictors. One would reach Serendib. Did hear rustling? Most likely one." "Do elephants swim? They might come here." "Hippopotami." "A black rhinoceros; they are rogues." "Hyenas." "Giraffes. They nibble half-way palm-trees." "Pumas." "Panthers." "'Possums." "Yaks." "Grizzlies." "Scorpions." "Heaps things bed crawling ceiling." "Jolly!" "Fork bacon." Mark forked up. "It looks queer," he said, dropping again. "Ought pot ashes?" "There is iron rod kettle swing on," said Bevis. "It is somewhere store-room. Is eight bells yet?" "I expect so," said Mark. "Rations late. A mutton chop now, fowl--" "Do not grow here," said Bevis. "You cut steaks buffaloes they are alive, fry elephants, boil turkeys. There fowls." "It seems me," said Mark, "that ought gun here. Suppose savages land canoes get us hut? It is twenty yards stockade; I think." "I never thought that," said Bevis. "There may fifty canoes full reeds, proas flying almost. Fetch gun-- quick." Mark ran brought it. "Load ball," said Bevis. The ball rammed home. Pan set joyous bark. "Kick him," said Bevis, languidly raising one arm. He lying his back. "He will bring savages, crocodiles." Pan kicked, crouched. Mark leaned gun teak-tree, sat again. "Awfully hot," he said. "Always tropics." "Ought awning," said Mark; "and hammocks." "So did," said Bevis, sitting up. "How stupid forget hammocks. Did ever see anything like it?" "We make awning," said Mark. "Hang one rugs four corners." "Capital. Come on." They fastened four pieces cord corners rug, found trees grow close enough together, set two poles near teak, tie cords one end rug these. The others tied branch teak. By time done worked hot putting awning get cool. There breath wind, warm even double shadow teak awning. "Bacon must done," said Bevis. "Must," said Mark. They could rest quarter hour. They forked out, Mark held fork, Bevis ran hut piece board put on, forgotten dishes. Setting bacon board, put ground awning (Pan wanted sniff it), tried slice. It exactly nice, disagreeable, considering forgotten scrape it, take rind off. But biscuits good bread. "We must make dampers," said Mark; "you know, flour cakes: cannot bake, have not got oven." "Dampers proper," said Bevis. "That is gold-mining. Very likely heaps nuggets somewhere--" "Placers." "And gold-dust river." "No mustard. And I recollected salt!" said Mark. "I say; bacon quite nice?" "Well, no; quite." "I do not like it." "No, I do not." "Wish could brought meat." "Cannot keep meat tropics." "Shall chuck Pan?" "No, all. Here, give slice. Pooh! He sniff's it. Just see! He is pampered; he will not eat it. Here, take board, Mark, put store-room." Mark took board bacon it; went hut. He came back mug full ale, saying better drink got quite stale. "We must shoot something," said Bevis. "We cannot eat much stuff." "Let us go round island," said Mark, "and see there is anything about. Parrots, perhaps." "Pigeon-pie," said Bevis. "Parrot-pie; thing." "Hammer Pan, he will run first spoil everything." Volume Two, Chapter XV. NEW FORMOSA--FIRST DAY. Bevis lit match, went quietly wood. Pan he hammered restrain rushing brambles. They knew way well, often walked round building hut looking poles, trampled rough path winding thorns. The shooting teak-tree noise Pan's barking alarmed parrots; though looked water several places, wild-fowl seen. As came round group cedars side island Mark remembered great jack pike he seen there, almost big shark. They went softly, peering round blue gum bush, saw jack basking sun, good way shore, edge weeds. The sunshine illumined still water, could see perfectly, his long cruel jaws, his greenish back white belly, powerful tail. Drawing back behind blue gum, Bevis prepared matchlock, blow match fire might ready it, opened pan, pushed priming touch-hole, shaken he walked, advanced staff rest edge bush. He put heavy barrel it, knelt down. The muzzle long matchlock protruded leafy boughs. "Ball cartridge," whispered Mark, holding Pan collar. "Steady." "All right." Bevis aimed barrel, strands wire rather interfered his aim, glance passed one other, rather along level barrel. The last strand hid end barrel altogether. It wanted sight. He looked along, got gun straight fish, aiming broadest part side; he remembered fish really lower water appears, depressed muzzle till pointed beneath under-line jack. Double-barrel guns hammers fall fiftieth second, driven strong spring directly finger touches trigger, translate instant action. The gunner snatches second his gun absolutely straight, shot flies destination barrel deviate thirty-second part inch. When Bevis's finger first pressed trigger matchlock he barrel his gun accurately pointed. But he pulled match pan appreciable moment time intervened; his mind too--so swift operation--left fish, his mark object, became expectant explosion. The match touched priming. Puff! So infinitely rapid mind, far outstrip gunpowder, flash pan tiny smoke seemed Bevis occur quite little time great discharge, little time his mind left barrel, came look tiny puff smoke. Bang! ball rushed forth, course would taken hair-trigger spring instantly translated his original action. In momentary divisions time elapsed since he settled his aim, long barrel, resting staff moving easily pivot, imperceptibly drooped trifle breech risen much muzzle. The ball flew high, hit water six inches beyond fish, fired low angle ricochetted, went skipping along surface, cutting pieces weed till friction dragged under, sank. The fish swished his tail like scull stern boat screw steamer, swift his spring forward, he would escaped ball gone high. He left undulation surface he dived unhurt. Bevis stamped his foot think he missed again. "It water," said Mark. "The bullet went duck drake; I saw it." He recall fact his hit teak-tree, tree much larger fish. As he recall his success tree, Bevis's irritation went farther. "We must top-sight," he said. "We will not use bullets till sight." "No, will not. But I am sure I gun straight." "So rifle straight, hit." "No, it. There is something peculiar bullets--we find out. I wanted jack supper." As brought powder-horn them, walked back hut. "It is gun's fault, I am sure," said Mark. "It shoots beautiful; it is turn next." "Yes; shall shoot. O! no, it is gun. They shoot sparrows India single ball," said Bevis; "and matchlocks kill tigers better rifles. Matchlocks splendid things." "Splendid things," said Mark, stroking stock gun, he carried his shoulder, breathing pet could appreciate his affection. "This curious groove," said Bevis, looking score bark teak Mark's bullet struck it. "Look, goes little round; bullet stuck tree went little way round, instead coming straight, so." "So did," said Mark. "It curved round tree." "My arrow would glanced way," said Bevis, "if hit here." "The ball goes one way arrow other." "One sticks tree long shoots aside directly." Bullets known like manner strike man's head front part score track half round it, even much injury. "We ought keep gun loaded," said Mark, reached hut. "Yes; ought slung up, put anywhere might knocked over." "Let us make slings it." After loading gun time charge shot, ramming home brass ramrod--Mark enjoyed using ramrod much hurry it--they set work drove two stout nails uprights opposite side bed. To one nails loop cord fastened; similar piece tied one end, lesser loop, take nail. When hung down, made loop like other. The barrel gun put first loop, stock held piece cord hitched nail, long gun hung suspended. "It looks like hunter's hut now," said Bevis, contemplating matchlock. "I will put bow corner." He leaned his bow corner, put sheaf arrows it. "My spear go here," said Mark. "No," said Bevis. "Put spear bee head." "Ready use night?" "Yes; put knobstick too. That is it. Now look." "Does not look nice?" "Just does not it!" "Real hunting." "Real real." "If Val, Cecil, Ted could see!" "And Charlie." "They would go wild." "The store-room _is_ muddle." "Shall put straight?" "And get things ship-shape?" "Yes." They began assort heaped-up mass things cave, putting tools one side, provisions other, odd things centre. After awhile Mark looked his watch. "Why, it is past five! Tea time home." "I do not know," said Bevis. "I expect time's different--it is longitude." "We hours later, then?" "While it is tea time here, it is breakfast there." "When go bed, get up. Here is astrolabe. Take observation." "So I will." The sun lower now, tops trees. Bevis hung circle gate-post stockade moved tube till he could see sun it. It read 20 degrees graduated disc. "Twenty degrees north latitude," he said. "It is equator." "But it is tropics." "O, yes!--it is Cancer, right enough. It is better Equator: obliged lie still day long; it is swamps steaming moisture fevers malaria." "Much nicer here." "O! Much nicer." "How lucky! This island put right." "The spot!" "There ought ditch outside palisade," said Mark. "Like outside tents run water away rains. I have seen round tents." "So ought. We will dig it." They fetched spades shovelled away half hour, warm, sat presently inside fence, began cast shadow. "We ought blacks sort work," said Mark. "White people cannot slave tropics," said Bevis. "Let us nothing while." "Lemonade," said Mark. Bevis nodded; Mark fetched opened bottle, another. "There four left," he said. "A ship ought come every year kind things," said Bevis. "It ought wrecked, could get best things wreck. Shall shooting?" "Practising. We ought practise ball; said would till sight." "But it is loaded shot, it is turn; there is nothing supper, dinner to-morrow." "No is. One thing, though, practise shooting, shall frighten birds away." "Ducks," said Mark, "flappers coots, moorhens, they are evening. The sun's going down: let us shoot one." "Very well." Mark got matchlock, lit match. He went first, Bevis followed, two three yards behind, Pan. They walked quietly possible along path made round island, glancing water intervals. As approached end island, ground low thick reed-grass sedges, moved still gently. They saw two young ducks, far; whether heard suspected something swam among bed rushes shoal. Mark stooped, went water's edge. Bevis stooped followed, set gun rest, hidden behind fringe sedges reed-grass left cutting roof. The muzzle almost, quite, protruded sedges, sat wait dry grasses reaped, carry, requiring cut. The ground near edge soft yielding, dry hay sedge flag better sit on. Bevis held Pan collar, waited long time sun sank north-westwards, almost front, them. "No twilight tropics," whispered Mark. "But there is moon," said Bevis. The moon half full, already high sky, her light continued glow sunset. Restless were, sat still, took greatest care slightly changing positions ease rustle dry sedges. Pan like it, he reconciled awhile. Presently Mark, nearest standing sedges, leaned forward moved gun, Bevis glanced his shoulder saw young wild duck among weeds shoal. "Too far," he whispered. It looked long way. Mark answer; he aiming. Puff--bang! Bow-wow! Pan water, dashing smoke could tell whether shot taken effect not. The next moment saw duck struggling splashing unable dive. "Lu--lu!" "Go on, Pan!" "Catch him!" "Fetch him!" "He is got him!" "He is weeds." "Look--he cannot get back--the duck drags weeds." "Pan! Pan! Here--here!" "He cannot it." "He is caught." "He will sink." "Not he." "But he will." "No." After striving his hardest bring duck back thick weeds, Pan suddenly turned swam shoal rushes grew. There he landed stood moment duck's neck his mouth: bird still flapped struggled. "Here--here!" shouted Bevis, running along attract spaniel place weeds looked thinner. Mark whistled: Pan plunged again; time, learned strength weeds, he swam round laid bird feet. "It is beauty." "Look his webbed feet!" "But he is big!" "But he is young one." "Of course: feathers pretty." "He kicks still." "Kill him. There; must pluck evening. Some feathers Frances." "O! Frances! She is use," said Mark, carrying his bird legs. The head hung down, Pan licked it. Plucking found tedious business. Each tried turn till tired, still seemed end feathers. "There thousands them," said Bevis. "Just could skin." "But feathers prettier." "Well, try now." Bevis plucked awhile. Then Mark tried again. This courtyard hut. The moonlight quite succeeded day. By watch past nine. Out doors light, hut Bevis strike match see time. "It is supper-time," he said. "Now breakfast home, I suppose." "I dare say we are quite forgotten," said Bevis. "People always are. Seven thousand miles away they are sure forget us." "Altogether," said Mark. "Of course will. Then day they will see two strange men long beards bronzed faces." "Broad-brimmed Panama bats." "And odd digger-looking dresses." "And revolvers pockets sight, come strolling door ask for--" "Glasses milk, they are thirsty, they are sipping--as do not really like stuff--just ask quietly governor's alive kicking--" "And Jolly Old Moke asleep his armchair--" "And mamma's put new red curtains." "Then they will stare--and shriek--" "Recognise rumpus." "Huge jollification!" "Everybody tipsy happy." "John Young tumbling pond." "Bells ringing." "I say, ought forgive Bailiff Polly?" "Hum! I suppose so. But that is long time yet?" "O! long time. This duck never done." "We forgot tea," said Mark. "So did; tea would nice. With dampers like diggers," said Bevis. "Let us tea now." "Finish horrid duck to-morrow," said Mark. "I will hang up." "Fire's gone out," said Bevis, looking gateway. "Cannot see sparks." "Gone long ago," said Mark. "Pot put out." They left pot ashes. "It would good plan light fire inside stockade now," said Bevis. "It make tea, keep things away night." "Lions tigers," said Mark. "If want jump fence will not dare face fire. But it is warm; must make hut." "Put one side," said Bevis, "in corner cliff. Bring sticks." They plenty wood stockade, piled up, chips branches ends poles made roof fence. The fire soon lit. Bevis got iron rod swing kettle. Mark went dipped zinc bucket full water. "Are things New Sea?" he said he came back. "It is dark go wood, water looks strange moonlight." "Very curious things I dare say," said Bevis, lit lantern, shaking tea tin teapot hut. "Curious magic things." "Floating round; misty, cannot see them." "But know they are there." "Genii." "Ghouls." "Vampires. Look, there is big bat--and another; they are coming back again." "That is nothing; everything's magic. Mice magic, especially they are red. I will show Faust. If they are dun they are half much magic." "More mousey." "Yes. Besides, wood would see things behind trees; might think shadows, they are not: lights moving about--sparks--" "Magic?" "Magic. Stars magic. There is one there. And things trees, satyrs fern, come trees water ladies--very beautiful, like Frances--" "Frances plain." "That she is not." "She is short." "Well, tree-ladies large. If I hook secret lore, that is right name--" "A magic hook?" "I would make come dance sing us." "But monsters?" said Mark, stirring fire. Volume Two, Chapter XVI. NEW FORMOSA--MORNING IN THE TROPICS. The flames darted up, mingling moonlight cast reddish-yellow glare green-roofed hut, yellowy cliff sand, throwing shadows fence, illuming Pan, sat door hut. The lantern, Bevis left floor, behind spaniel. Outside stockade trees wood cast shadows towards them; moon shone high sky. The weird calls water-fowl came distance; sticks crackled hissed. Else silent, smoke rose straight still air. "Green eyes glaring black wood," said Bevis. "Huge creatures, prickles backs, stings: ground heaves underneath, come; one claw first--you see poking chink--and hot poisonous breath--" "Let us make circle," said Mark. "Quick! Let us lock gate." "Lock gate!" Mark padlocked it. "I will mark wizard's foot it. There,"--Bevis drew five-angled mark his pencil boards--"there, they are done." "They cannot come in." "No." "But might see them?" "Perhaps, yes." "Let us play cards, look round." "All right. Bezique. But kettle's boiling. I will make tea." He took kettle filled teapot. "We ought damper," he said. "So did: I will make it." Mark went hut got flour, set work made paste: see, busy, know things look like shadows, shadows. He pounded away paste; time produced thick flat cake dough, put ashes covered over. They put two boards table ground, front hut door away fire, set lantern one end table. Bevis brought teapot tin mugs, forgotten cups saucers, made tea; Mark buttered heap biscuits. "Load matchlock," said Bevis. Mark loaded gun, leaned door-post backs, within reach. Bevis put his bow two arrows close his side, he sat down, he could shoot quicker his bow case sudden surprise, matchlock. The condensed milk took minutes get ready, began. The corner hut kept glow fire; leaned backs door-posts, one side, Pan came between. He gobbled buttered biscuits, perfectly civilised; one, other, fast liked let him. "This jolliest tea ever was," said Mark. "Is not jolly seven thousand miles anywhere?" "No bothers," said Bevis, waving his hand keep people distance. "Nothing niceness." "And please." "Had enough?" "Yes. Bezique." "I will deal." "No--no; cat." The cards dealt two rough boards, played, using old coins brought counters. Pan watched little while, he retired, finding nothing eat, stretched yards away. The fire fell lower, flickered, blazed again: last sticks thrown burning middle broke half rolled one side half other; smoke ceased rise, heated vapour took place visible. By-and-by moon's white light alone filled interior stockade, entered doorway hut, glimmer horn-lantern reach beyond boards tables. At last candle guttered went out, played moonlight. "Ah, ah!" said Bevis presently. "Double bezique!" shouted Mark; "and money's mine!" Pan looked noise. "The proper thing is, shoot table," said Bevis: "that is buccaneers do." "But revolvers lived," said Mark; "only matchlocks." "Shovel up," said Bevis. "Broad gold pieces, will not long. I am tired to-night. I shall win to-morrow, estate, watch, shirt back, wife--" "I shall not wife," said Mark, yawning he pocketed coins, copper. "I do not want Frances--O, no! thank much!" "What is time?" "Nearly twelve." "I am tired." "Make bed." They began make it, recollected one rugs teak-tree, hoisted awning. Bevis took his bow arrow; Mark his spear. They called Pan, thus, well armed ready monsters, marched across teak, glancing fearfully around, expectant green blazing eyes awful coiling shapes; quite fearless time, aware nothing. They pull poles get awning down. On returning stockade, gate padlocked bed finished. The lantern, fresh candle placed, hung cord ceiling, found much way. "If there is alarm night," said Mark, "and anybody jumps quick, he will hit his head lantern. Let us put box." "Chest," said Bevis; "it is always chest." Mark dragged chest bed-side, put lantern it, box matches handy. The matchlock hung up; teapot mugs things put away, spear bow knobstick arranged instant use. Bevis let carpet doorway, shut moonlight like curtain. They took boots got bed clothes on. Just Bevis blow candle, he remembered something. "Mark--Lieutenant, how is barometer?" "Went ship, sir." "How is weather then? Look see tornado's brewing." "Ay, ay, sir." Mark stepped curtain, looked round, came again. "Sky's clear," he said. "Only moon little shooting star, little one, mere flicker like striking lucifer does not light." "Streak light wall." "Yes." "No tornado?" "No." "Thirty bells," said captain. "Turn in. Lights out." He blew candle made comfortable. "What is that?" said Mark minute. A corner curtain lifted, let moonlight floor. "Only Pan." Finding he alone outside, Pan came curled chest. "Good-night." "Good-night." "Good-night, Pan," said Bevis, putting his hand touching Pan's rough neck. Almost he could bring his hand back firm asleep. Quite tired long, long day exertion change, fell asleep second, without twilight preliminary drowsiness. Change wearies much labour; journey, instance, looking rows pictures different colours. They slept like buccaneers humming-tops, unconsciously throwing covering rug partly off, summer night warm. The continuance easterly breezes caused atmosphere become dry mist, morning opened clear, still, bright. After Pan stretched himself, got up, went out. He could leap fence, looking round found place joined cliff, quite closed up. They knew this, forgotten it. Pan pushed his head under, struggled, scratched, till his shoulders followed he lay his side, rest followed easily. Roaming round, he saw pot bacon boiled still grey ashes fire teak. The lid off, thrown aside, he ran pot, put his paws rim, lapped greasy liquor relish. Loo, cottage girl, could she seen, would envied him, she dry crust breakfast, would eagerly dipped in. Pan roamed round again, came back hut waited. In hour's time he went more, lapped again, returned watch sleepers. By-and-by he went third time stayed longer. Then he returned, thrust his head curtain uttered short bark impatient questioning, "Yap!" "The genie," said Mark, awaking. He dreaming. "What is time?" said Bevis, sitting instant, he never asleep. Pan leaped bed barked, delighted see moving. "Three of the clock," said Mark. "No; it is stopped!" "It is late, I know," said Bevis, gone doorway lifted curtain. "The sun's high; it is eight nine, more." "I never wound up," said Mark, "and--well I never! I have left key home." "It key," said Bevis. One fact. "Now shall not know time is," said Mark. "Awfully awkward you are seven thousand miles anywhere." "Awful! What stupe were; leave key?" "On dressing-table, I think; no, drawer. Let us see, waistcoat: I saw floor; I remember, mantelpiece, else washing-stand. I know, Bevis; make sundial!" "So I will. No, it is use." "Why not?" "I do not know begin." "When begin?" "Well sundial must start. You must begin hours, do not see." "I see; do not know hour put shadow." "That is it." "But cannot find out? Is not sun always south noon?" "But quite south?" "Just exactly proper south?" "Yes, meridian name. I know, north star!" "Then must wait till night know time to-day." "And till sun shines again--" "Till to-morrow." "Yes." "I know!" said Mark; "Charlie. You make sundial, he will wave handkerchief four of the clock." "Capital," said Bevis. "Just thing--like Jupiter's satellites; know, hide behind, people know time seeing them. Charlie set clock us. There is always dodge everything. Pan, Pan, old rascal." Bevis rolled over. Pan barked leaped them, ran sunshine. "Breakfast," said Mark; "what is breakfast?" "Well, make tea," said Bevis, putting his boots. "That best. And, I say, forgot damper." "So did. It breakfast." The damper raked ashes, left found well done, rather burned one side. When burnt part scraped off, ashes blown it, tasted fair, extremely dry. "The butter will not last long," said Mark presently, sat breakfast ground two boards. "We ought another shipload." "Tables without legs awkward," said Bevis, whose face heated tending fire lit boiling kettle. "The difficulty is, put knees." "Or else must lie down. We could easily make legs." "Drive short stakes ground, put boards top," said Bevis. "So presently. The table ought little one side doorway, cannot wheel along way." "Big stumps logs would stools," said Mark. "Saw short, stand end." "The sun's warm," said Bevis. The morning sunshine looked courtyard, least shade. "The awning ought put table." "Let us put up, then. I say, rough hair looks." "Well, look washed. Shall go swim?" "Yes. Put things away; here is towels." They replaced breakfast things anywhere, leaving teapot bed, went water, choosing shore opposite Serendib, side weeds. As came strand, already tearing coats, stopped look New Sea, still, smooth, sunlit. Though broad seem far to-day yellow cliff quarry, sward battlefield, massive heads sycamores war raged. There breath wind, passage much air coming eastwards last week left atmosphere clear periods rain. The immense sycamores stood sky, broad green curve tops drawn along blue. Except shimmer uncertain yellow distant shore could see reflection quarry really there, line vision stood came nearly level surface water, look along it. Beneath feet saw bottom New Sea, slender shapes fish hovering interstices stones, here, gone. There nothing fish, looking tree. The mere surface film transparent, beneath seemed nothing. Across Serendib boughs dipped boughs came meet them. A moorhen swam, her imago followed beneath, unbroken, gently she part water ripple confused it. Farther woods jungle far away rose up, mountain wall still boughs, mingled distance one vast thicket. Southwards, looking seawards, instead long path gold wavelets strew him, sun beamed water, throwing stream light faces, looked fire Archimedes cast his mirrors melting ships. All light summer fell water, glowing sky, clear air, sun. The island floated light, stood light, light shadow trees, thick brambles; light deep water, light surrounded mist might; could see far illumined sky water. The leaves light well became films transparent green, delicate branches delineated finest camel's hair point, grass blades heaped together apart, edges apparent thick confusion; every atom sand upon shore sought beams, given individual existence amid inconceivable multitude sibyl alone counted. Nothing lost, grain sand, least needle fir. The light touched things, gave be. The tip shimmering poplar moss covert bulging roots. The swallows flew light, fish swam light, trees stood light. Upon shore breathed light, silent till white butterfly came fluttering over, another white butterfly came water, looking particular released power general. "Magic," said Bevis. "It is magic." "Enchantment," said Mark; "who it--the old magician?" "I think book says Circe," said Bevis; "in Ulysses book, I mean. It is deep enough dive here." In minute he ready, darted water like arrow, sent arrow glances surface. Throwing his side he shot along. "Serendib!" he shouted, Mark appeared his dive under. "Too far," said Mark. "Come on." Mark came on. The water seem resist morning, parted let through. With long scoops arms uppermost, swimming side, slipped still strokes, impetus carrying till stroke came again. Between strokes glided buoyantly, lifted water swallows glide plane air. From hand thrust front beyond head feet presently striking back--all space hands feet seemed grasp. All portion water power, elasticity strokes compressed threw forward. At long sweep Bevis felt stronger hold, his head shot farther surface like stem Pinta freshening breeze drove her. He see he going, his vision lost ecstasy motion; his mind concentrated full use his limbs. The delicious delirium strength--unconsciousness reason, unlimited consciousness force--the joy life filled him. Presently turning his chest breast-stroke he struck his knee, immediately stood up: "Mark!" Fortunately stones, his knee would grazed; bottom sand. Hearing call Mark turned his chest stood too. They waded way, found another deep place, swam across carefully, walked shallow continued shore Serendib, stood willow boughs. "Pan!" Volume Two, Chapter XVII. NEW FORMOSA--PLANNING THE RAFT. Pan sat strand watching till appeared land side, sound his name he swam them. Now might see superior he was, two human animals stood afraid enter island lest rough bough abrade skins, thorn lacerate, thistle prick feet, Pan sooner reached land he rushed in. His shaggy natural coat protected him. In minute came moorhen, another, third, scuttling surface legs hanging down. Two minutes Pan drove coot out, young duck rose flew distance, dab-chick rushed dived instantaneously, still moorhens, coots. "Why, hundreds!" said Mark. "What place shooting!" "First-rate," said Bevis. "It is full moorhens sorts." So was. The island Serendib foot level water, completely grown willow osiers (their blue gum), spaces stoles choked sedges reed-grass, vast wild parsnip stalks "gix," rushes, mass vegetation water-fowl delighted. They undisturbed long time, looked Serendib theirs; would move till Pan midst them. "We must bring matchlock," said Mark. "But cannot swim it. Could catamarans?" "They are awkward you have got anything carry," said Bevis, remembering his dip. "I know--we will make raft." "Then go islands," said Mark, "that ever much better; shoot round everywhere." "And go river," said Bevis, "and go continent, mainland, know, see it is China, South America--" "Or Africa Australia, shoot elephants--" "And rabbits hares peewits, pick pearls Pearl Island, see end world there," pointing southwards. "We have never end yet," said Mark. "Let us go back make raft directly." "The catamaran planks capital," said Bevis, "and beams, I will see Ulysses made his, make like it--he sail somehow." "We could sail night," said Mark, "nobody would see us." "No; Val Charlie would sure see daytime; stars would guide us night, would proper." "Just like used to--" "Yes, like used lived three thousand years ago." "Capital. Let us begin." "So will." "Pan! Pan!" Pan busy routing hitherto happy water-fowl he follow begun swim, waded far could. The shoals reduced actual distance swim quite half, reached New Formosa without trouble, dressed. They went hut Bevis might read Ulysses constructed his ship raft, looking book saw duck plucked evening before. This put mind dinner, cook it, would ready used home. They inclined let dinner take chance, buttered biscuits rather wearisome, concluded cook dinner first, make raft afterwards. It hot stockade, fire lit teak-tree shade, duck singed, hung double string hazel rod stuck ground. By turning round double string would wind up, left unwind like roasting-jack. The heat huge fire made, added summer sun, great--they could approach it, therefore managed turn duck fashion long stick. After done time, working shirtsleeves, became impatient, eve quarrelling mere restlessness. "It is use here," said Mark. "One's enough cook." "One's enough cooked," said Bevis. "Cooking hateful thing I ever knew." "Most awful hateful. Suppose say shall to-day I to-morrow, instead stuck fire?" "Why should not to-day, _I_ to-morrow?" "Toss up, then," said Mark, producing penny. "Best two three." "O! no," said Bevis. "You know many penny dodges. No, no; I know-- get cards, shuffle cut, cuts highest goes he likes--" "Ace highest?" "Ace." The pack shuffled, Mark cut king. Bevis got picture-card, he cook day. "I shall take matchlock," said Mark. "That will not." "That I shall." "You will not, though." "Then I will not anything," said Mark, sulking. "It is fair; cut king would gun." Bevis turned his duck, poking round stick, he could help admitting Mark right. If he cut king he would taken gun, fair Mark so. "Very well," he said. "Take it; mind it is turn to-morrow." Mark went matchlock, came stockade it. But he gone many yards he returned hut, put slings. Then he picked his fishing-rod store-room, his perch-line hooks, mixed mustard water his tin mug, started off. Bevis, sat far enough fire escape heat, notice second time. Mark walked wood till he found moist place, he poured his mixture ground, pungent mustard soon brought worms up. These he secured, he know carry them, mug he used drinking from, like put it. Involuntarily feeling his pockets people difficulty, he remembered his handkerchief; he put moss it, made bundle. He one mug, he several handkerchiefs store-room, need use one again. Looking round island place fish, he came spot little headland projected Serendib side, farther bathed. At end headland willow trunk blue gum hung water, he came near kingfisher flew trunk away round Serendib. Mark thought likely spot, water looked deep, willow cast shadow one side, fish might come anything fell boughs. He dropped his bait in, sat shade watch his blue float, reflected still water. He used his right take matchlock, he came saw Bevis, whose back turned, he thought selfish he was, he knew Bevis liked shooting better anything. So he put gun back, went fishing. Against his wishes Bevis acknowledged Mark's reason right; his wishes Mark forbore use his right he might selfish. While Mark watched his float Bevis alternately twisted duck, sat teak-tree Odyssey, he read that-- On lone island's utmost verge stood Of poplars, pines, firs lofty wood, Ulysses selected felled enough his vessel, and,-- At equal angles disposed join; He smooth'd squared rule line. Long capacious shipwright forms Some bark's broad bottom outride storms, So large he built raft: ribb'd strong From space space, nail'd planks along; These form'd sides: deck he fashioned last; Then vessel raised taper mast, With crossing sailyards dancing wind, And helm guiding rudder join'd. Pondering Bevis planned his raft, intending make six eight beams poplar, placed lengthways; across floor short lesser poles put close together; thirdly, layer long poles; catamaran planks deck. He enough plank make sides he proposed fix uprights extend railing round, wattle willows, would keep wash waves, like bulwarks. Even then, perhaps, sea might flush deck; he meant fasten chest store-room locker, preserve stores might take them. A long oar would rudder, working starboard side, would mast; course craft could sail wind--she could tack. In shallow water--they could pole along like punt better row, raft would cumbrous. Arranging his mind, he let duck burn one side; tendency burn, he could baste it. Soon he sat he wondered time was, recollected sundial. This must made once, must ready Charlie made signal. He looked sun, whose place he could distinguish, branches sheltered his eyes full glare. The sun seemed high, he thought must already noon. Giving duck twist, he ran hut, fetched piece board, his compasses, gimlet. Another twist, teak-tree he drew circle compasses board, scratching steel point wood. With gimlet he bored two holes aslant other, ran two nails file. In his haste, get back turn roast, he notice matchlock hung hut. He filed heads nails, tapped gimlet holes; wanted little bending, points met, forming gnomon, like putting two forefingers together. Then he bored two holes board, inserted nails half through, ready hammering post. The post he cut one poles left fence; short thick, he sharpened one end, leaving top flat sawn off. Fetching iron bar, he made hole ground, put post in, gave one tap; duck wanted turning again. As he returned his work he remembered evening teak trees wood cast long shadows towards hut, would blot time sundial. It ought put full beams would fall sunrise sunset. The cliff place. He ran chose spot he could see would free shadow, pitched post, ran duck. Next he carried dial, nailed top post; two nails kept moving touched, much firmer one. The gnomon cast pointed shadow side circle opposite sun, yet marks hours. He could stay look his work, went teak, began wonder he hear Mark shoot, though likely heat day water-fowl cross open water island. Thinking shooting reminded sight much wanted top barrel. He could solder anything on, drill hole, fix it, use file notch, nothing would stick notch, iron like wood. Perhaps sealing-wax would--a lump sealing-wax--but he none store-room; would look proper either, sure get chipped directly. Could he tie anything on? The barrel fastened stock wire, twist two pieces wire round, put nail head (the nail filed short) them, much hats hung brim two straps. That would do, presently he thought still easier way, put piece wire round barrel fasten it, tight, like loose ring. Then pliers seize part upper side barrel twist it, forming little loop loose wire; would tighten ring, twisting upper loop round would make short tiny coil upon itself, coil would capitally sight. He wished Mark would come matchlock, he might put sight once. He looked duck; seemed done, he certain, sat rest shadow. A cooing came wood, doves yet finished nesting. Bevis tired turning roast, determined try could make earth oven. The way he thought dig hole ground, put layer hot embers, meat; another layer hot embers; meat entirely surrounded them: finally, cover clay placed quite confine heat. One little hole let us steam gas: made standing small stick oven, finished, drawing leave tube. He certain quite right, he could remember, would worth trying. This horrible cooking took much time, made hot uncomfortable: shipwrecked people wanted slave cooking. But he thought he soon whistle Mark. Pan gone him, came back, Bevis supposed, weary waiting ambush; but, fact, eye dinner. Mark's float move: stood exactly upright, jerk, causing tiny ripple, come up, move along, dive disappear, going aslant. It remained exactly upright, shot-weight line kept it. There wind, line water blow aside float rotate. Long since he propped his rod forked stick, weighted butt flat stone, save trouble holding it. He sat down, Pan sat him: he stroked Pan teased him; Pan moved away watched, arm's reach. By-and-by spaniel extended became drowsy. Mark's eyes wearied blue float, he stretched himself, lying his side his head his arm, he could see float, he opened his eyes, without moving. A wagtail came ran along edge sand near his rod he could reached it. Jerking his tail wagtail entered still water joints his slender limbs, came out, ran along again. Mark's head almost touched water: his hair (for his hat off, usual) reflected it, great brown water-beetle passed reflection. A dove--his parrakeet--came entered wood; Bevis afterwards heard cooing. Mark half opened his eyes, thought wagtail's tiny legs thicker one Frances's hair-pins. The moorhens coots recovered fright Pan given them. As he gazed chinks his eyelids along surface water, he could see one one returning towards Serendib, pausing way among weeds, swimming again, nodding heads, turning side pick anything saw; still, gradually approaching island opposite. They came one direction, he remembered Pan hunted out, scuttled way. So wild duck; kingfisher. "I believe go river," Mark thought; "the river flows weeds. Just wait till got raft." Something swam presently shore New Formosa; something nearly flush water, left wake widening ripples behind it, Mark knew rat: water-fowl, though move rapidly, much undulation. The rat swam good way, turned came again. This coasting voyage he repeated shore several times. To look along surface, Mark did, like kneeling glancing broad well polished table, eyes level it. The slightest movement visible great way--a little black speck crossed seen once. The little black speck raised small degree surface, something water visible following it. The water undulated, less behind rat; moorhens nod heads fro, I nod: black speck waved way, side side, kept steadily onwards. Mark recognised snake, swimming swiftly, head (black distance contrast gleam crystal top polished table) surface, sinuous length trailing beneath water. He see whence snake started, he saw go across weeds extreme end Serendib, lost it. He thought huge boa-constrictors hidden interior New Formosa, would basking quite still heat, he ought brought his spear him. You never ought venture stockade unknown places without spear. By shadows moved, his foot sunshine: he could feel heat leather. Two bubbles came surface close shore: he saw second one start sand rise quickly slight wobble, sand move, he could see anything it. His eyes closed, he slept, gleam water inclined retire shadow lids. After time shrill pipe. Mark started, lifted his head, saw kingfisher, come back towards his perch willow trunk. He came within three yards he saw Mark; he shot aside, shrill whistle alarm, rose went island. In starting up, Mark moved his foot, butterfly floated away it: butterfly settled sunshine heated leather. With three flutters, butterfly floated broad wings stretched thin grass shore. It effort fly thistledown. The start woke Pan. Pan yawned, licked his paw, got wagged his tail, looked one way other, went back Bevis. The blue float still perfectly motionless. Mark sat up, took his rod wound winch, began wander homewards too, idly along shore. He gone way he saw jack basking willow bush aslant him, markings his back visible seen sideways, position foreshortening crowded together. They like water-mark paper, seen best low angle, mark silk, somewhat remind mackerel. Volume Two, Chapter XVIII. NEW FORMOSA--KANGAROOS. So soon he sure jack noticed him, Mark drew softly back, difficulty forced way bramble thickets towards stockade. He thus entered part visited, trees bushes thick water, usual path followed windings shore. Trampling going round others, Mark managed penetrate thickets, taken his rod pieces, constantly caught branches. Next he came place scarcely anything grew, everything strangled Thugs wood, wild hops, except scattered ash-poles, wound, indenting bark spirals. The ground covered them, for, slain supports, forced creep, he walked hops; bower them, smothering bramble bush, nightingale "kurred" angrily. He came near nightingale's young brood, safely reared. "Sweet kur-r-r!" The bird like it. These wild hops favourite cover nightingales. A damp furrow natural ditch, dry, evidently watercourse rain, seemed stopped march creeping, twining plant, he entered among hazel-bushes; seeing daylight, fancied he close stockade; his surprise, stepped open glade green knoll one side. The knoll rise quite high trees, quantity fern lower part, open lawn grass, little meadow midst wood. He saw white tail disappear among fern--there rabbits here. "Bevis!" said Mark aloud. In his surprise he called Bevis, he would done Bevis present. He ran knoll, he ran, white tails--little ones--raced fern, he saw burries sand-heaps thrown out. On top knoll numerous signs rabbits--places worn bare, "runs," footpaths, leading across grass. He looked round, could see nothing trees, hid New Sea cliff home. Eager tell Bevis discovery, especially rabbits, would furnish food, were, all, something fresh shoot at, he ran hill fast he could stop himself, though he saw something white grass. He returned, found mushrooms, he gathered twenty thirty minutes--"buttons," full grown mushrooms, overgrown ketchup ones. How carry he know, used his handkerchief already, left his coat home, till he thought his waistcoat, took made rough bundle it. Then he heard Bevis's whistle, well-known notes always used call other, shouted reply, shout penetrate far shrill sound done. The whistle came different direction he supposed cave be, winding brambles he lost true course forgotten look sun. He found he could go straight home, brambles succeeded blackthorn, nothing human move, hardly spaniel, thick here. He go round opposite shore island, weed-grown side, fire teak-tree. "Where is gun?" said Bevis, coming meet him. "I left home." "No, it." "I put back coming." "I never saw it." "It is hut." "Did not really take it?" "No--really. We will go gun--" "So will." Bevis regretted he made difficulty. "No, it is turn; shall it." "I shall not," said Mark. "Look here,"--showing mushrooms--"splendid supper, I have found rabbits!" "Rabbits!" "And little green hill, kingfisher, jack. Come get gun, let us shoot him. Quick." Mark began run matchlock, left duck itself. Bevis ran him, Mark told went. They talked much sign mere monosyllables short run hut I cannot transcribe words, though understood better used set speech. For two people always together know exact meaning nod, indication glance, motion lip means page conversation. Having got gun came back, Mark said perhaps Pan would eat duck. Bevis called him, he need call. Gluttonous epicure he was, Pan, whistle Bevis, would left marrowy bone world; Bevis gun! why, Polly broom-stick could stopped him. Before got willow bush settled Mark shoot jack, matchlock loaded shot, Bevis wanted shoot ball, reserved his turn time he made new sight. Bevis held Pan Mark went forward. The jack there, Mark could get rest position take steady aim, willow boughs interfered so. So Bevis knelt down, still holding Pan, Mark rested long heavy barrel his shoulder. The shot plunged water, jack floated, blown yard away, dead his back; his head shattered, long body untouched. Pan fetched out, laughed spaniel, he looked odd fish his mouth. Bevis wanted see glade rabbit's burries, Mark said, duck done, would burn cinder, went home dinner. By time reached teak-tree, duck indeed burned one side. It dry hard lack basting, cut up, unsavoury; made nicer was, every found shots--which teeth flattened--shots gun. These saved, Mark put his purse; six altogether. Mark gloried number, long shot duck, showed he aimed straight. The ale wooden bottle stale, drank water, little sherry it; started see discovery Mark made. Pan went them. The old spaniel long before, he found rabbits first stroll he took landing Pinta, could convey his knowledge them. Bevis marked tree, behind could wait ambush shoot rabbits, within easy range burries; then, felt afternoon, returned stockade, got telescope went cliff watch Charlie's signal. The shadow gnomon dial moved good way since Bevis set up. They least idea hour, somehow felt afternoon. Long habit makes us clocks, pause, forced consult ourselves. Slow changes frame proceed till recognised mind, rather subtle connexion mind body; seems nexus, medium, conveys kind eighth sense flesh mental consciousness. Birds animals know time without clock dial, months seasons almost day; so, too, human animal, driven conveniences civilisation, save trouble thinking soon reverts original indefinable indications. For instance (though different way), set clock senses awake exactly hour choose morning. If put watch aside, reversing process, listen senses, tell afternoon. The sandy summit cliff warm, bramble bushes high enough give shade; that, escape sun, reclined ground front young oak-tree, edge. Bevis looked telescope, could see sand-martins going holes distant quarry. Charlie hill, or, so, he behind sycamore sight; knew he yet made signal, herd cows hollow oak, standing water. They yet called milkers. Sweeping shore Fir-Tree Gulf, Mozambique projecting bluff prevented farther view, he saw crow sand, another perched rail; another sign one about. "Any savages?" said Mark. "Not one." "Proas hauled somewhere sight." Mark carefully felt his way verge, sat his legs dangling over. He said cliff quite safe; Bevis joined him. Underneath could see deep water; though still, could distinguish bottom. Clear surface, water seemed thicken dense shadow, could seen through. It deep there; thought like dive, far plunge. There ball thistledown surface, floating tips delicate threads; spokes flies wheel rolls. "How rabbits--I mean kangaroos--get here?" said Bevis presently. "I do not think could swim far." "Savages might bring them," said Mark. "But do not often carry pets them: eat everything so." "Nibbling men like goats nibbling hedges," said Bevis. "We must take care: kangaroos get island?" "It curious," said Mark. "Perhaps was not always island--joined mainland river cut way isthmus." "Or volcano blew up," said Bevis. "We see find volcano." "But gone now." "O! yes. All sort things happened one see them." "Before lived." "Or anybody else." A large green dragon-fly darted fro feet water; overhead, top oak, round cliff back again; weaving across across warp weft air. As sat still he came close, saw his wings revolving, sunlight reflected membrane. Every slight snap, he seized fly, ate he flew: eager he speck wood-dust fell oak, though he yards away, he rushed intercepted could reach ground. It rejected, he returned whence he started moment. "The buffaloes moving," said Mark. "They are going hill. Get ready. Here, put shoulder." The herd begun ascend green slope water's edge, doubtless response milker's halloo could hear island. Bevis rested telescope Mark's shoulder, watched. In point fact far could seen one quarry without glass, telescope proper. "There he is," said Mark. Bevis, looking telescope, saw Charlie come behind sycamore, he lying shadow, standing edge quarry, wave his white handkerchief three times, interval between. "It is right. White flag," said Bevis. "He is looking. He cannot see us, he?" "No, bushes behind us. If stood sky perhaps he might." "I will crawl dial," said Bevis, he went hands knees sundial, he could stand without seen, brambles oak cliff. He drew line his pencil shadow gnomon fell circle, four of the clock. Mark came after, creeping too. "We will not sit again," said Mark, "when it is signal-time. He keeps staring. You see his face telescope. We keep behind tree." "There ought crow's nest it," said Bevis. "Suppose make one. Lash stout stick across two boughs, tie cords across half round, able sit watch nicely." "So will. Then see savages prowling round." "The sedges thick side," said Bevis, pointing eastern shore struggle them. "They would hide five thousand savages." They went hut, Bevis made sight matchlock. The short spiral copper wire answered perfectly, he could take accurate aim. But he put powder in, going put bullet, he recollected kangaroos. If he shot much target bullets time afternoon would alarm everything island, report would heard it. Kangaroos water-fowl generally evening morning, he put trial ball loaded shot. It use going ambush till shadows lengthened, he set getting tea Mark sawed two posts, drove ground one side doorway hut. Each post cross-piece top, two boards placed these, forming table. Bevis made four dampers, Mark's suggestion buried number potatoes embers fire, baked supper, save cooking. The mushrooms saved breakfast, jack, two pounds' weight, would dinner. When he finished table, Mark went teak-tree, fetched two poles set awning. These he erected table, stretched rug table, fastening two edges posts hut. They found nights warm one rug unnecessary, could spared permanent awning sit table. Some tea put aside drunk cold, miner fashion, time go shooting. Mark gun, he would go himself, Bevis must accompany him. They go distance round get glade, made much noise pushing aside branches, discussing whether going right way, reached kangaroos feeding, disappeared. "I bring axe," said Bevis, "and blaze trees, shall know way minute." Fixing rest he could command burries side knoll, Mark sat ash-tree previously selected, leaned heavy matchlock staff. They chose tree brake fern grew front concealed them. Pan come understand manner hunting, he lay once, needed holding. Bevis extended full length his back behind Mark, looked sky ash branches. The flies would run his face, though Mark handed frond fern swish with, he partly covered his handkerchief. The handkerchief stretched across his ear like top drum, he lying quiet fly ran across handkerchief there, he distinctly heard sound feet. It slight rustle, feet caught little surface handkerchief. This happened several times. The sun line tree-tops, glade shadow, except top knoll, shadow slowly rose like tide sun declined. Now edge shadow reached sand-heap thrown burrow; thicker bunch grass; thistle; last slipped top second. Mark could see three pairs tiny, sharp-pointed ears grass. He knew young rabbits, kangaroos, small eating. They difficulty, use, pricked listened, he made least movement, ran would stop larger ones coming out. There something moving hazel stoles across glade he could make out, he could ask Bevis look see minute kangaroos. Ten minutes afterwards squirrel leaped hazel, began dart hither thither along sward, drawing his red tail softly grass arching leap lightly Jack drew tassel his whip his mare's shoulder he wished caress soothe her. Another followed, two played along turf, often hidden bunches grass. Mark dared touch Bevis tell him, he fancied larger rabbit sitting his haunches mouth hole fringed fern. Bevis his handkerchief listened Pan snapping his teeth flics, looked sky till four parrots (wood-pigeons) came over, descended oak far off. The oak thick ivy, roost-tree, though intend retire yet. Presently he saw heron floating immense height. His wings moved slowly he seemed fly without pressure air--as slowly lady fans herself one coquet with. The heron mean descend New Sea, he bound voyage he wish complete till dusk began, hence his deliberation. From his flight might know mainland somewhere direction. Bang! Mark ran knoll, Pan him, time seize wounded kangaroo hindquarter he paddling hole fore paws. Mark seen rabbit behind fringe fern move, knew really one, gently he got matchlock position, moving sixteenth inch time, Bevis know he aiming. By new sight he brought gun bear spot he thought rabbit's shoulder must be, he could see it, rabbit moved, struck haunch, would struggled reach Pan him. The squirrel disappeared, four parrots flown report. "This island full things," said Bevis, Mark told squirrel. "You find something new every hour, I do not know shall not find last. But shooting killed everything." "Well, I have," said Mark. "The duck, jack, kangaroo. You _must_ shoot something next." ------------------------------------------------------------------------ End Volume Two. Volume Three, Chapter I. NEW FORMOSA--BEVIS'S ZODIAC. They returned hut prepared kangaroo fish boiling morrow; fish coiled saucepan, kangaroo pot. Pan paunch, his great brown eyes glaring his head gluttony, made his private larder, where, eating his full, he buried rest. Pan his private den behind thicket bramble, he kept bones duck, bacon bone, added his store. Here he retired occasionally civilisation, like king Polynesian island, enjoy nature, away etiquette his attendance court Bevis Mark. Next, Mark one old axes used excavate store-room, cut notch edge cave, opened hut, large enough stand lantern in, chest would required raft. They raked potatoes ashes, supper, damper, last fragment duck, cold tea, like gold-diggers. Bevis recollected journal he proposed keep, got book, yet one entry, single word, "Wednesday." He set table awning, lantern open him. Outside edge awning moon filled courtyard her light. "Why, it is Thursday now," said Mark. "We have one full day, seems weeks." "Months," said Bevis. "Perhaps means Wednesday last year." "Of course: next year that. How must altered! Our friends would know us." "Not even mothers," said Bevis. "Nor jolly old mokes governors." "Shot kangaroo," said Bevis, writing; "shot duck jack--No. Are jacks? That is common name?" "No; jacks: jack-sharks." "No; sun-fish: they are always sun." "Yes; sun-fish." "Shot sun-fish: saw two squirrels, heron, four parrots--" "And kingfisher--" "Halcyon," said Bevis, writing down--"a beautiful halcyon; made table sun-dial. I must go presently mark meridian north star." "Saw one savage." "Who that?" "Why, Charlie." "O yes, one savage; believe five thousand jungle mainland." "Seven thousand miles anywhere. Put down," said Mark. "Twenty degrees north latitude; right. There, look; half page already!" "We ought wash sand see there is gold," said Mark--"in cradle, know." "So did. We ought looked duck's gizzard; tiny nuggets get gizzards sometimes." "Everything goes river beyond weeds," said Mark; "that ought written." "Does everything go river?" "Everything. While I fishing I saw come back Serendib it." "We must make haste raft." "Like lightning," said Mark. "Let see," said Bevis, leaning his arm table stroking his hair end penholder. "There blue gum trees, palms, banyans." "Reeds--they are canes." "Sedges papyrus." "The big bulrushes bamboos." He meant reed-mace. "Yes, bamboos. I have put down. There ought list everything grows here--cedars course; that is something else. Huge butterflies--" "Very huge." "Heaps flies." "And tiger somewhere." "Then ought names fossils, metals, there is coal," said Bevis; "and raft must dredge anemones pearl oysters, and--" "And write fish." "And everything. The language natives bother. I must make new alphabet it. Look! A,"--he made tiny circle; "that is B, two dots." "They gurgle throats," said Mark. "That is gurgle," said Bevis, making long stroke dot it; "and click tongues roofs mouths. No: it is awkward write clicks. I know: there, CK, that is click, curve means tongue--the way you are put make click." "Click! Click!" "Guggle!" "Then there is names idols," said Mark. "We would better find some." "You cut some," said Bevis; "cut knife stick, say they are models, would not let take real ones. The names; let us see--Jog." "Hick-kag." "Hick-kag; I have put down. Jog Hick-kag always quarrelling, hit one another, that is thunder. That is say." "Noodles." "Natives always noodles." "But one thing capital though." "What is that?" "Stick together." "How? Why?" "If take hatchet chop big notch them, stick together directly." "Join up." "Like glue." "Then thing is, savages get here? Nobody ever us; come from? There sure grand ruins jungle somewhere," said Bevis, "all carved, covered inscriptions." "Huge trees growing top." "Magic signs chipped stones, books made string knots instead writing." Kaak! kaak! A heron descending. The unearthly noise made look up. "Are tidal waves?" said Mark. "Sometimes--a hundred feet high. But thing get here? How anybody ever get anywhere?" "It is crooked," said Mark, "very crooked: cannot quite see it, you? Suppose go sun-dial: I am sleepy." "Well, go bed; I it." "Good-night!" said Mark. "Lots chopping to-morrow. We ought brought grindstone axes. You got plan ready raft?" "Quite ready." Mark went hut, placed lantern niche, threw bed. In half minute he firm asleep. Bevis went courtyard, round outside fence, cliff sun-dial. The stars shone brighter usually thought moon; fact much moon state atmosphere. There haze dry air, he could see Pole Star distinctly. He sat down--as post dial supported low--on southern side, north. He still stoop till he got tip gnomon cover North Star. Closing one eye, aiming, he put his pencil dial circle groove scratched compass. The long pencil held upright groove, moved round till intercepted his view star. The tip gnomon, pencil, Pole Star direct line, row one behind other. To make sure, he raised his head looked gnomon pencil star, he found he holding pencil upright; leaned east, made error west his meridian. "It ought plumb-line," he thought. "But I think it is straight now." He stooped again, found gnomon pencil correct, pressing pencil hard, drew towards groove little way. By moonlight he got he could see mark he left, showed exact north. To-morrow he would draw line mark straight gnomon, shadow fell line would noon. With fixed point noon fixed point four of the clock, he thought he could make divisions rest hours. The moonlight cast shadow east noon-line, she crossed meridian. Looking up, he saw irregular circle moon high sky, brilliant scored relievo work enchased upon her surface obscured bright light reflected it. Behind numerous lights glittered still water, near hand sharp clean points, far away short bands light drawn towards him. Bevis went young oak sat it. Cassiopeia fronted him, Capella; Northern Crown, faint low; westward great Arcturus shone, though moon taken redness him. The cross Cygnus lying side carried eastern sky; beneath Eagle's central star hung Nile. Low south, unknown river Antares, too, lost his redness. Up branches oak he saw Lyra, purest star heavens, white whitest clearest light may be, gleaming zenith pale blue dome. But horizon northwards faint white light, faintest aurora, another moon rising there. By he knew his position, he looking way he gazing large northern window parlour home, he lying green path strawberries, he sometimes summer evenings. Then North Star, minute clear--so small, yet chosen axle focus sky, instead sun-like Sirius--the North Star always shone group elms orchard. Summer winter, spring autumn, always there, always elms-- whether reddening buds flowers February, whether dull green heats August, whether yellow October. Dick his Team, whose waggon goes backwards, swung round like stone sling whirled shoulders. Sometimes tail Bear, Dick bestrides his second horse, hung behind elms vapour horizon. Sometimes Pointers nearly overhead. If hidden cloud, Lesser Bear gave point; could draw line Cassiopeia, tell North her chair stars. The comets seemed come within circle Bootes--Arcturus always know way beyond tail Bear. The comets come inside circle stars never set. The governor seen three four appear his time, elms Pole. Donati's, perhaps remember, came there--a tiny thing twelve inches long nucleus tail look at, afterwards weird sign world stood amazed at. Then another long after, seemed appear broad streak across sky. Like sketches old star-maps, indeed cross whole sky night two, went quickly world awake midnight wonder at. Lately two come enchanted circle stars never set. All stars Arcturus Capella came elms orchard; Arcturus went place sunset autumn, Capella began shine another group elms--in meadow north-east. Capella sure seen, begins become conspicuous people say sky star-lit winter sends first frost two. But Capella brightest star northern sky summer, always came second north-east group elms. Between two groups tall trees--so tall thick generally visible even dark nights--the streamers Aurora Borealis shot winter, summer faint reflection midnight sun, like lunar dawn precedes rising moon always appeared. The real day-dawn--the white foot Aurora--came sky-curtain little right second group, young oak hedge across road, opposite garden wall. When leaves left young oak brown, rustled frosty night, massy shoulder Orion came heaving it--first one bright star, another; gleaming girdle, less definite scabbard; great constellation stretched across east. At first sight Orion's shoulder Bevis always felt suddenly stronger, breath mighty hunter's come entered him. He stood upright; his frame enlarged; his instep lifted he walked, he could swing vast club chase lion his lair. The sparkle Orion's stars brought remnant immense vigour young world, frosty air braced his sinews, power came his arms. As constellation rose, presently new vigour entered trees, sap moved, buds thrust forth, new leaf came, nightingale travelling south sang musical April nights. But Orion south, Sirius flared like night-sun great oak top Home Field. Sirius rose young oak opposite garden wall, passed third group elms, rick-yard, gleaming branches--hung spring great oak top Home Field, lowered degrees westwards behind ashes growing end New Sea harbour. After Arcturus came, lorded Midsummer zenith, lucent Lyra looked upon him. Up, too, little oak came Aldebaran red Bull's-Eye, bent rod Aries, cluster Pleiades. The Pleiades he loved most, first constellation he learned know. The flickering Pleiades, star-dusted spot Cancer, Leo, came succession. Antares, harvest-star, scarcely cleared great oak southwards summer. He got movable planisphere, best star-maps ever made, proceeding step step, drawing imaginary lines one other, Pointers Pole, knew designs northern dome. He transferred map trees. The north group elms, north-east group, east oak, south-east elms, southern great oak, westward ashes, orchard north-west,--through like zodiac stars moved, east west, except enchanted circle Pole. For Bear Lesser Bear sometimes seemed move west east returning, swinging would place rising. Fixing thus night, he knew many day; Pole Star always north elms--when starlings stayed whistled flew housetop, rooks called sun set way home jungle, fieldfares gloomy winter noon perched there. The Pole Star always elms. In summer mornings sun rose north east, second group elms little oak--so far north he came vale instead downs. The morning beams lit northern outer side garden wall, fell aslant narrow kitchen window, beam ceiling. In evening sun set northwards orchard, north elms, come round towards place rising, shining outside garden wall, seemed miles between. He sink, dipped, dawn travelled indicated his place, moving north north-east elms, overcoming night little oak. The sun rise sink; he travelled round immense circle. In winter mornings sun rose young oak third group elms, red vapour hung, his beams presently shot window logs kitchen hearth. He sank south-westerly ashes orchard, rising wall Downs, sinking behind it. At noon he over, little higher great southern oak. All day long outer side garden wall shadow, night northern sky black horizon. The travelling dawn visible: sun rose sank, visible half great circle. The cocks crowed four afternoon, rooks hastened jungle. But by-and-by, giant Orion shone his full width grasping sky, mornings sun's rising began shift backwards--first edge third group elms, straight road, little oak. In afternoon, place setting likewise shifted backwards north, came behind orchard. At noon he twice high southern oak, every day noontide shadows gradually shortened. The nightingale sang musical April night, cowslips opened, bees hummed meadows. Last all, sweet turtle-doves cooed wooed; beauteous June wearing her roses came, sun shone highest point his great circle. Then could look unless boughs tree. Round zodiac elms, little oak, great oak, ashes, orchard, sun revolved; house, garden path strawberries--the best place see--were centre his golden ring. The sward path Bevis used lie gaze summer evening, real, tangible; earth real; elms, oak, ash-trees, real tangible--things touched, known be. Now like these, mind, stepping one other, knew almost felt stars real mere specks light, things day elms well night, apparitions evening departing twittering swallows. They real, touch his mind felt them. He could not, he reclined garden path strawberries, physically reach feel oak; he could feel oak his mind, oak, stepping beyond it, he felt stars. They always day well night. The Bear sink, sun summer dipped, his reflection--the travelling dawn-- shone him, unravelling enlarging sky, he felt well knew neither stars sun ever rose set. The heavens always around him. The strawberries sward garden path, he reclining there, moving through, among, stars; much strawberry leaves. By day sun, he sat oak, much boughs great tree. It like swallows. The heavens much part life elms, oak, house, garden orchard, meadow brook. They separated furniture parlour, old oak chair he sat, saw new moon shine mulberry-tree. They neither beneath, place him; walk wood trees you, plane you, he felt constellations sun plane him, he moving among earth rolled on, like them, them, stream space. The day shut stars, night shut sun; always there. Not he always thought them, never dismissed. When he listened greenfinches sweetly calling hawthorn, he read his books, poring Odyssey, sunshine wall, always there; severance. Bevis lived finches swallows, far-away hills, he lived felt sky. It living, thinking. He lived it, never thinking, finches live sunny life happy days June. There magic everything, blades grass stars, sun stones upon ground. The green path strawberries centre world, round day _and_ night sun circled magical golden ring. Under oak New Formosa warm summer night, Bevis looked he reclined white pure light Lyra, forgot everything consciousness living, feeling beyond it. The earth water, oak, went away; he went away: his mind joined linked ethereal space beauty. Bevis, know think: done thinking, analysis him. He felt lost larger consciousness heavens. The moon moved, shadow cliff water beneath, planet rose eastwards new Nile, water-fowl clucked flew over. Kaak! Kaak! Another heron called his discordant piercing yell sounded water, seeming penetrate distant shadowy shores. The noise awoke him, he went hut. Mark firm asleep, lantern burned niche; Pan curled bedside, lifted his head wagged his tail, thumping floor he entered. Bevis let curtain closing doorway, put lantern, three minutes firm Mark. After time, Pan rose quietly went out, slipping curtain, fell back place he passed. Volume Three, Chapter II. NEW FORMOSA--THE RAFT. They get till sun high, Mark lifted curtain robin flew table outside, he picking crumbs, across gate-post stockade. The gate shut--Pan lying fence, cast shadow morning evening. "Pan!" said Mark; lazy spaniel wagged his tail, come. "I shall go finish sun-dial get breakfast," said Bevis. It Mark's turn to-day, he went gate he stooped patted Pan, looked speaking affection his eyes, stretched his full length utter lassitude. Bevis drew line gnomon mark he made night before, noon meridian. Then he drew another mark shadow fallen four of the clock afternoon. The space two he divided four equal divisions drew lines one, two, three of the clock. They nearly two inches apart, measured exactly he added four beyond, eight of the clock, he thought sun set eight; seven side shadow would fall morning, he supposed sun rose five. His hours, therefore, ranged five till eight, he added half lines show half-hours. When done shadow gnomon touched nine, he shouted Mark nine of the clock. He knew his dial correct, hour lines ought drawn show time every day year, his would show short while. How often he drawn pencil-mark along edge shadow window-frame south window parlour! In early spring, bitter east wind raged, he used sit old oak chair south window, every warm sunshine fell break ranks marching clouds. Out wind March sun warm pleasant, lasted he dreamed his books, his Odyssey, his Faust, his Quixote, his Shakespeare's poems. About eleven sunshine generally came, he drew line frame mark hour. But two days verge shadow gone on, eleven left pencil-mark behind. He marked again, went sun, coming higher higher, described larger ring. So his pencil-lines window-frame he measured spring graduated coming summer, till eggs goldfinch's nest apple-tree hard set. From he knew his sun-dial correct, sun day described circle slightly less before, shadow would change error increase. Still dial would divide day them, could work arrange plans it. Had best chronometer ever made would use. All time artificial, time correct them. Mark shouted breakfast ready, he went down, sat table awning. "Pan's thieving," said Mark. "There half damper table last night, gone morning, two potatoes left, I put skin kangaroo fence, that is gone--" "He could not eat skin, could he?" said Bevis. "Pan, come here, sir." "Look him," said Mark, "he is stuffed full he hardly crawl--if he hungry he would come quick." "So he would. Pan, old rascal! What done kangaroo skin, sir?" Pan wagged his tail looked one other; sound voices stern, he detected goodwill it, really angry. "And damper?" "And potatoes? And could eat leather fur, sir!" Pan put his fore-paws Bevis's knee, looked he done something clever. "Pooh! Get away," said Bevis, "you are false old rascal. Mark, cut piece bacon presently." "So I will--and I will put things higher up," said Mark. "I will drive nails posts make shelf, you will done, sir." Pan, finding nothing eat, walked slowly back fence let fall down. "Too lazy lie properly," said Bevis. After breakfast put shelf, placed eatables Pan's reach, taking towels started bath. "It might rat," said Mark; "that looks gnawn." He kicked jack's head cut off, shattered shot, thrown outside gate. "But Pan's full, else he would come," spaniel follow usual. So soon gone robin returned table, took he liked, ventured hut minute, perched fence Pan returning wood. Bevis Mark swam waded Serendib again. There light ripple morning south-east, gentle breeze cooled day. They said would hasten construct raft, able shoot water-fowl, Bevis wanted first try matchlock ball he fitted sight. He fired three times teak-tree, Mark pinned small piece paper bull's-eye, thirty yards he hit tree well, paper. The bullets below, nearest four inches bull's-eye. Still much better shooting. He loaded gun shot, took hatchet--the two good load--intending look wood suitable timber, keep gun possible shot something. But he got ready, Pan shaking together began drag his idle body him, he thought Mark looked dull. It Mark's turn cook, he already got fire alight teak. "I will not go," he said; "I will stop help you. Things stupid yourself." "Fishing stupid, yourself," said Mark. "Let us make rule," said Bevis. "Everybody helps everybody instead going themselves." "So will," said Mark, glad, new rule agreed to, could shoot once, understood former contract stand, matchlock day himself. The pot saucepan, kangaroo jack soon on, found boiling one great advantage roasting, could pile sticks go away time, instead watch turn roast. They found good many small trees poles wanted far home, among rest three dead larches snapped tornado. These dry trees lighter would float better green timber. For larger beams, foundation raft, chose aspen poplar, cross-joists firs, dinner-time collected nearly enough. It half-past one sun-dial Mark began prepare table; Bevis gone haul catamaran planks place raft built. Under one planks, he turned over, little lizard; creature first remained still dead, touched ran quickly, grasping grass sideways claws monkey grasps branch. With end plank arm Bevis hauled across materials. This time nicer meal prepared: fish game; kangaroo white juicy, almost white chicken, young summer rabbit cooked soon shot. It time indeed rabbit taste like rabbit. If tasted young one fresh shot summer, would care eat winter, discover frost improvement theory invention poulterers cannot keep stock unless bitterly cold. There sufficient left supper, bone two Pan. The chopping done made idle, agreed work till evening; lounged like Pan till time appointed look Charlie's signal. When went cliff quarter-past three dial, sat shade oak brambles behind would prevent seen sky line. After awhile Mark crept fours sun-dial, said half-past three, suddenly exclaimed time going backwards. The shadow gnomon slipped wrong way; he looked saw light cloud passing sun. Bevis often seen thing March, sitting southern window, shadow ran back his pencil-line window-frame clouds began cover blue roof. Charlie rather late to-day, he gave signal according promise: saw look long move away. Presently, Mark preparing tea, Bevis got matchlock practise again. They always ready tea, curious fact live much doors work hard, like gold-diggers abroad, reapers home labouring among golden wheat, prefer anything actually engaged midst toil; afterwards. Bevis set rest gateway stockade, took aim piece paper pinned teak-tree, fifty sixty yards distant. Twice he fired missed teak: he let Mark try, Mark also missed; third time he fired himself. None four bullets struck either tree branches; so, though could hit thirty yards, could rely gun sixty. Directly tea began work preparations raft, cutting poles sawing already proper lengths. Sawing hard work, causing continual strain upon muscles, change position possible chopping, obliged shifts, one working long other. The raft twelve feet long five wide. The beams foundation gave trouble procure, largest, every tree exactly size wished. They laboured moonlight, grew brighter every night moon increased, cease till materials ready; long beams aspen poplar placed side side (on rollers) near short cross-pieces fir holes bored nails, row long fir poles, short lengths plank form deck. Everything ready fitting together. It cost self-denial wait till thus prepared instead beginning nail frame together. There something driving nail tempting wrist; board ready, gimlet-hole made, hammer hand, physical mind desires complete design. They resisted it, knew really complete raft much quicker getting every portion frame ready commencing fix it. They recognise tired till started hut; backs, long bent sawing, stiffened position, pained straightened sinews stand upright; fingers crooked continually grasping handles; staggered walked, stiff limbs certain foothold, jerked ground uneven. Mark sat light fire courtyard, wanted tea; Bevis sat him. They dog-tired. Looking larder lay supper, Mark saw mushrooms forgotten; he hunted gridiron, put two handsful on. Now sight savoury mushrooms raised fainting spirits solid food, began talk again. While doing, Bevis cut Pan slice cooked bacon shelf; rather fat, pampered Pan, mumbling his chops, carried outside fence, came back trying look he eaten it. With mushrooms made capital supper, still tired. Bevis got his journal, he wrote "Friday," put away, remarking he must soon write letter home. Even cards could amuse them, tired; cry heron roused Bevis little, he took matchlock loaded shot, see he could shoot get plumes. "Heron's plumes thought good deal day lived, know. Did not knights use wear them?" he said. "Herons hard shoot." Mark came spaniel, walked softly path, well-worn, peered moonlit water, heron island, sight. He probably lesser islets among shallows, returned home immediately went bed, quite knocked up. Pan curled round bedside hour, he got slipped curtain moonlight. In morning went bathe mist water, curled along gathered thicker places, quite hiding Serendib, clearing away drawing towards unknown river. The water warm. They began nail raft together. On long thick beams placed short cross-pieces fir close together touching; long poles fir lengthways, also touching; lastly, short planks across making deck. There thus four layers, knew rafts sink good deal float deep, especially wood green, may see bough, tree-trunk brook quite half immersed goes current. It built rollers, Bevis, consulting his book, read Ulysses rigged his vessel:-- And roll'd levers, launch'd her deep. And, reflecting, he foresaw raft heavy would otherwise difficult move. The spot built her little Bevis leaped shore evening battle. The ground sloped water, rather deep. By noon raft ready--for decided complete rigging, bulwarks, fittings she afloat--and levers began heave her down. She moved slowly, rumbling crushing rollers sward. By degrees "Yeo! Heave-ho!" Pan set barking, raft approached water, forward part entered it. The weight rest prevented front floating, forcing straight surface till water rose third way along deck. "Yeo! Heave-ho!" Yow-wow-wow! Pan, idle morning lying ground, jumped round joined chorus. "Now! Heave-ho! She is going! Now!" "Stop!" "Why?" "She will slip away--right out!" "So she will." "Run rope." "All right." Mark ran piece cord hut. The raft hung edge half heaving water began float her, saw gave another push she would go impetus her weight would carry her away shore reach. Mark soon returned cord, fastened two stout nails. "Ready?" "Go!" One strong heave levers raft slid last roller, rose surface, water slipping deck side, floated. Seizing cord ran out, brought her to, Mark instantly jumped board. He danced kicked his heels--Pan followed ran round edge raft, sniffing water. The raft floated first-rate, deck, owing three layers it, high surface. These layers, too, gave advantage could walk verge without depressing water. Mark got held cord Bevis got on, shouted, "Serendib!" They pushed long poles, like punting, Pan swam soon started, hauled board. A short way shore channel deep poles would reach bottom, raft way her continued move, paddling poles kept slow movement till reached shallows. Thence Serendib poled along, one side. The end raft crashed among willow boughs, jerk grounded almost threw down. Pan leaped directly, followed, fastening raft cord painter willows. "Nothing blue gums," said Mark, led way. "What these?" pointing wild parsnips "gix" rose high heads, hollow-jointed stalks broad heads minute white flowers. "It is new kind bamboo," said Bevis. "Listen! Pan's hunting moorhens again. This kind spice--you sniff--the air heavy scent, always tropics." As pushed along shook meadowsweet flowers grew thickly, heavy perfume rose up. In willow stole blue gum Mark found nest sedge bird, empty, young birds hatched long since. "Mind do not step crocodile," said Mark, "you cannot see bit." The ground matted vegetation feet never touched earth all, trampled grasses, rushes, meadowsweet, triangular fluted carex sedges. Sometimes approached shore saw several empty nests moorhens coots, level water. Sometimes uncertain course led interior avoid thickets elder. If paused moment could hear rustling water-fowl rushed away. Pan gone beyond hearing now. Presently came small pool surrounded sedges--a black-headed bunting watched branch opposite. "No fish," said Bevis: could see bottom shallow water. "Herons kingfishers course." Crashing new bamboos last reached southern extremity island, shallow sea covered floating leaves weeds, blue dragon-flies flew fro. "Everything's gone river again," said Mark; "and where is Pan? He is gone too, I dare say." A short bark direction minutes made look islet round reed-mace rose tall fringe, Pan creeping weeds, dragging his body firm ground. He set great yelping islet. "Something is there," said Bevis. "Perhaps it is thing makes curious wave. Pan! Pan!"--whistling. Pan would come: he excited. "We must come evening," said Bevis, "and make ambush. There is heaps moorhens." As nothing else see Serendib worked way blue gums back raft, re-embarked New Formosa. Just landed Pan dashed water Serendib swam them. He seem quite himself, he looked he done something common could tell them. "Was crocodile?" said Mark, stroking him. Pan whined, much say, "I wish I could tell you," give vent his excitement he rushed wood. Volume Three, Chapter III. NEW FORMOSA--NO HOPE OF RETURNING. After fastening raft returned towards hut, hungry now, knew late, Pan set tremendous barking first listened, went see. The noise led green knoll rabbit burries were, saw Pan running round great oak thickly grown ivy, Bevis seen wood-pigeons alight. They went oak, large old, branches partly dead hung ivy; walked round examined ground, could see trace anything. Mark hurled fragment dead bough ivy, broke came rustling again, nothing flew out. There seem anything tree. "The squirrels," said Bevis, suddenly remembering. "Why, course," said Mark. "How stupid us--Pan, you are donk." They left oak went homewards: Pan quite quiet looking ground tree, directly he understood given search he set barking would follow. At hut Bevis went cut rashers bacon cooked Mark ran cliff see time. It already two of the clock--the work raft voyage Serendib taken morning. Bevis showed Mark mice gnawed edge uncooked bacon lying store-room top number thing's. Mark said he found tomtit shelf pecking food left there, like tomtit's impudence! "Rashers good," said Bevis, "if have not got cook them." It his turn, he broiling well bacon. "Macaroni eats his raw," said Mark. They often seen John Young eating thick slices raw bacon she would he sat luncheon. "Horrible cannibal--he is worse Pan, will not touch cooked." He looked outside gate--there slice cooked bacon Bevis cut spaniel lying ground. Pan even taken trouble put his larder. But something else gnawed it. "A rat's here," said Mark. "Do not remember jack's head?" "And mice cave," said Bevis. "And tomtit shelf." "And robin table." "And wagtail court yesterday." "A wren comes stockade." "Spiders there," said Mark, pointing corner hut web. "Tarantulas," said Bevis, "and mosquitoes evening." "Everything comes try eat us up," said Mark. The moment man takes his residence creatures wood throng round him, attracted crumbs his hand, spoil his labour affords. Hawks dart his poultry, weasels creep hen's eggs, mice traverse house, rats hasten round sty, snakes come milk, spiders flies, flies sugar, toads crawl cellar, snails trail wall, gnats arrive evening, robins, wrens, tomtits, wagtails enter courtyard, starlings sparrows nest roof, swallows chimney, martins eaves, rabbits garden among potatoes--a favourite cover game--blackbirds cherry-trees, bullfinches fruit-buds, tomtits take bees even, cats dogs matter course, still live man's labour. The sandy spot cliff frequented anything till cave made hut built, already mice them, Mark saying everything came eat wasp flew awning settled table. "Frances ought this," said Bevis, hot cross, amateur cooks always are. "Here, give mushrooms, they will nice. Do not wish she here?" "Frances!" said Mark tone horror. "No, I do not!" In afternoon nothing wait Charlie's signal, he faithfully gave, idled till tea. Pan come back till tea, he wagged his tail looked mysterious. "What doing, sir?" said Bevis. Pan wagged wagged gobbled buttered damper gave him. "Now, see," said Mark. He got cut slice cold half-cooked bacon shelf. Pan took it, rolled his great brown eyes, showing whites corners, wagged his tail short like pendulum small clock, walked outside gate it. Then he came back begged buttered damper. After tea worked raft, putting bulwarks carried chest locker. For sail meant use rug hung awning, put roof thatched sedges place. The sun sank finished, got matchlock--it Mark's day--and went ambush glade see could shoot another rabbit. Pan tied hit twice, he wanted race squirrels. They sat quiet ambush till weary, moon shining brightly, rabbits venture out. The noise Pan made barking squirrels evidently alarmed them, could forget it. "Very likely he is scratching burries too," whispered Bevis, little bats flew round glade, passing scarcely yard front like large flies. "He shall not leave us like he afternoon." It use stay longer, went quietly round shore island, seeing something move edge weeds, though could distinguish what, willow boughs hung over, Mark aimed fired. At report heard water-fowl scuttling away, running spot Pan brought two moorhens, one quite dead wounded. "There," said Bevis, "you have shot every single thing." "Well, do not use shot?--you will never kill anything bullets." "But I will," said Bevis; "I hit something bullets. The people India hit sparrow, cannot I? It is turn to-morrow." But supper, bringing his journal, he found to-morrow Sunday. "No, I cannot shoot till Monday. Mamma would like shooting Sunday." "No--nor chopping." "No," said Bevis, "we must not work." All island were, principle, disobedient, crossing wishes home authorities. Yet resolved shoot Sunday, people home would like it. When Bevis entered launching raft voyage Serendib journal, skinned moorhens prepared cooking. "This cooking horrible," said Mark. "Hateful," said Bevis; "I told ought Frances." "O! no; she would want her way. She wants everything she likes, she cannot it, she will not anything." "There, it is done," said Bevis. "What want slave." "Of course--two three slaves, work chop wood, fetch water." "Hit do not," said Bevis. "Like hit Pan." "Tie tree lash them." "Hard." "Harder." "Great marks backs." "Howling!" "Jolly!" They played two games bezique awning, drank last drop sherry mixed water. "Everything's going," said Bevis. "There is sherry, half flour's gone, Pan last bit butter damper tea--" "There ought roots island," said Mark. "People eat roots islands." "Do not think here," said Bevis. "This island old grow; it is like Australia, kind grey-bearded place nothing kangaroos." Soon afterwards drew curtain went sleep. As usual, Pan waited till firm asleep, slipped moonlight. He lounging courtyard got up. By sun-dial eight, breakfast, left fire banked ashes--wood embers keep alight long time like that-- went bathe. "How quiet is!" said Mark. "I believe it is quieter." "It seem so," said Bevis. The still water glittered sun light south-east air drew it, could hear single lark singing mainland, somewhere sight. "Somehow swim ever much better used home," said Mark, dressing again. "Ever much," said Bevis; "twice far." This fact, whether continuous outdoor life, greater confidence entirely alone. "How I like punch somebody!" said Mark, hitting his fist. "My muscles like iron," said Bevis, holding his arm. "Well, hard," said Mark, feeling Bevis's arm. So his own. "It is living island," said Bevis. "There is bother, nobody says you are anything." "Only there is potatoes clean. What nuisance are!" They began dimly perceive that, perhaps, all, women might use earth. They go back hut get dinner ready. "The rats potatoes," said Bevis. "Just look!" Mark came, saw something gnawed potatoes. "And lots gone," he said. "I am sure there is lot gone since yesterday." "Pan, do not kill rats?" cried Bevis. Pan looked up, much say, "Teach business, indeed." "Bother!" said Mark. "Bother!" said Bevis. "Hateful!" "Yah!" They flung knives potatoes. "Would raft wrong Sunday?" "Not little bit," said Bevis. "Just Pearl Island?" "No--that would not hurt." "Let cooking stop." "Come on." Away ran raft, pushed off, making Pan come them, he disturb rabbits again. The spaniel lazy, he would even follow till he compelled. He sat gravely raft chest, locker, poled along shore, deep pole middle channel. But southern end New Formosa water shoaled, could leave shore. One standing one side, one other, thrust raft along among islets, till reached Pearl Island, easily distinguished glittering mussel shells. A summer snipe left islet came near, circled round, approached again, finding still there, sought another strand. Pan ran round islet, sniffing water's edge, then, finding nothing, returned raft sat his haunches. The water one side Pearl Island four five inches deep long way out, shelving sand crows got mussels. They carried bank left shells, fell open, wind blew sand them. They found one large she will, span long, took spoil. There nothing else small fossils like coiled snakes turned stone. Next poled across islet extremity Serendib, Pan made noise. To get go distance round, shallow. They poled raft among reed-mace bamboos, rose heads water besides part stalk surface. The reed-mace like bulrush, three times tall, larger. They cut number spoils, landed. Pan showed little activity here, much. He sniffed round water's edge, soon returned stretched raft. "He cannot smell anything to-day," said Bevis. "There is halcyon." A kingfisher went by, straight New Formosa. The marks moorhens' feet numerous shore water, showing calm lately, waves would washed bottom covered them. The islet small, merely ridge bank, pushed again. Passing bamboos, paused looked them--the tall stalks rose around really thicket bamboo. "Hark!" They spoke together. It stern solemn note bell tolling. It startled silence New Sea. The sound came hills, knew bell church big Jack went to. The chimes, thin perhaps weak, lost hills, continuous toll five minutes bell penetrated miles air. So bush men call constantly repeating hollow note, "Cooing," way human voice heard extraordinary distance. Each wave sound drives predecessor, driven wave follows, till widening circle strikes shore distant ear. "Ship's bell," said Bevis presently, listened. "In latitudes air clear hear ships' bells hundred miles." "Pirates?" "No; pirates would make noise." "Frigate?" "Most likely." "Any chance taken rescued?" "Not least," said Bevis. "These islands chart. She will two hundred miles away tea-time. Bound Kerguelen, perhaps." "We shall never found," said Mark. "No hope us." "No hope all," said Bevis. They poled towards Serendib, intending circumnavigate island. By time gone half-way, bell ceased. "Now listen," said Mark. "Is not still?" They lifted poles water, sound (the lark long finished), nothing drip, drip drops poles, slight rustle heavy raft dragged weed. They could almost hear silence, quiet night sometimes, listening intently, may hear faint rushing, sound blood reverberating hollow ear; day needs she will collect it. "It curious," said Bevis. "But heard sound anybody till bell." "No have." There sounds quite audible, absorbed island life heard them. To-day busy. The recognition silence bell caused seemed widen distance home. "We long way home--really," said Bevis. "Awful long way." "But really?" "Of course--really. It feels farther to-day." They could touch bottom poles way round Serendib, before, crossing New Formosa, give stronger push edge deep channel, carry shallower water. It late cook moorhens, resolved contented rashers, see could get mushrooms. Directly got near hut, Pan rushed inside fence began barking. When reached place he sniffing round, every giving sharp short bark, he knew something, could make out. "Rats," said Mark, "and they have taken bacon bits Pan left outside gate." Pan trouble came in. After preparing rashers, looking sun-dial, noon, Bevis went look mushrooms knoll, Mark managed dinner. Bevis go round get knoll, wishing disturb rabbits necessary, made Pan keep close his heels. But he reached open glade, Pan broke away, rushing towards ivy-clad oak, set barking. Bevis angrily called him, Pan would come, he picked stick, instead returning heel, Pan dashed underwood, Bevis could hear barking long way across island. He thought squirrels, looked mushrooms. There plenty, he soon filled his handkerchief. As he approached hut, Mark came meet him, said happening look shelf he missed piece cooked bacon left there,--had Bevis moved it? Volume Three, Chapter IV. NEW FORMOSA--SOMETHING HAS BEEN TO THE HUT. "No," said Bevis. "I left last night; do not remember I cut piece Pan, he would eat it?" "Yes; well, it is gone. Come see." They went shelf--the cooked bacon certainly gone; ground part hut cave. "Pan must dragged down," said Bevis; "and yet it is high, besides, he did not care it." "He could jump high," said Mark. "Besides, he us time." "So he has." They kept Pan close them, ever since he disturbed kangaroos much. "Then, could Pan." "And I do not see rats could climb up, either," said Mark. "The posts," (to shelf fixed) "are upright--" "Mice run leg chair," said Bevis. "That is short way; is--let see--why it is higher shoulder." "If Pan, rats, could be?" said Bevis. "Something is here," said Mark; "Pan could smell he came in." "Something oak," said Bevis, "and he is gone racing light end island." "Something took bit bacon ground." "And gnawed jack's head." "And piece damper." "And took potatoes." "Took potatoes twice--the cooked ones raw ones." "It is curious." "I do not believe Pan could jumped up--he would shaken things shelf, too, he got his great paws on." "It must something," said Bevis; "things could go themselves." "There is something island do not know," said Mark, nodding his head down, his way times upset full idea. "Lions!" said Bevis. "Lions could get up." "We heard roar." "Tigers?" "They would killed Pan." "But think there is one reeds." "Yes, he come here." "Boas?" "No." "Panthers?" "No." "Something curious wave saw?" "Perhaps. Well, _is_ curious now, is not it?" said Mark. "Just think; first, Pan could it, rats could it, it is gone." "Pan, Pan," shouted Bevis sternly, spaniel came gateway hesitatingly; "come here." The spaniel crouched, knowing he thrashing. "See anything's bitten him," said Mark. "What after, sir?" He examined Pan carefully; signs fight him-- nothing cleavers seeds goose-grass clinging his coat. Bang--thump--thump! yow! Pan his thrashing, crept fro, even daring curl corner, dragging along ground behind them. "Think," said Mark, he turned mushrooms gridiron; "now, it?" "Not fox?" said Bevis. "No; foxes would swim here; plenty rabbits jungle mainland." "Nor eagles?" "No." "Might cat." "But cats island, and, besides, cats would take bacon two moorhens shelf." "No; Pan would moorhens too, him." "So would anything, that is it is curious." "Nobody could come here, could they?" said Bevis. "The punt's bottom, Pinta's chained up--" "And must seen swam off." "Nobody swim," said Bevis, "except governor." "No," said Mark, "no can--not even Big Jack." "Nobody place us. It could governor, he found hut he would stopped see lived it." "Of course he would. And besides, he could come without knowing it; always about." "Always about," said Bevis, "and seen footsteps." "Or heard splashing." "And Pan would bark him," said Bevis. "No, could one; must something." "Something," repeated Mark. "And likely magic wave." "But _could_ wave?" "I cannot think; something magic. It does not matter." They dinner, then, usual, went cliff wait Charlie's signal. "I shall try catch perch to-morrow," said Mark, "if there is wind. We are always eating thing." "Every day," said Bevis, "and cooking greatest hatefulness ever known." "Takes much time." "Makes hot horrid." "Vile." "It wants Frances, I said." "No, thank you; I wish Jack would her." Mark looked telescope Charlie, swept shores New Sea. "How could anything get island?" he said. "Nothing could get it." From elevation cliff saw felt isolation New Formosa. "It magic wave," said Bevis; "something magic." "But put wizard's foot gate?" "So I did, perhaps I draw quite right; I will again. But rats made gnaw lines sometimes, let magic things in." "Draw another ink." "So I will. There is sea-swallow." "There is two." "There is four five." The white sea-swallows passed them, going water, coming south. They flew yards surface, irregular line--an easy flight, easy scarcely seemed know flap wing would carry them. "There storm." "A tornado." "Not yet--the sky's clear." "But must keep watch, careful sail raft." The appearance sea-swallow tern inland waters believed, like gull, indicate tempest, though sea-swallows usually come finest weather. "There is Charlie. There two--three," said Mark, snatching telescope. "It is Val Cecil. Charlie's waving his handkerchief." "There, it is right," said Bevis. "They pointing way," said Mark. "They are talking us. Can see us?" "No, brambles would let them." "I dare say they are cross cross," said Mark. "They want come. I do not know," said Bevis, considering. "Know what?" said Mark sharply. "That it is altogether nice us." "Rubbish--as would let _us_ come." "Still, them, might would not." "Now, do not stupid," said Mark appealingly. "Do not _you_ go stupid." "No," said Bevis, laughing; "but must come done." "O! yes, course. See, they are going towards firs: there, they are going cross Nile. I know, do not see, they are going round New Sea, like did, try find us--" "Are they?" said Bevis. "They shall not find us," resentfully. The moment he thought rest going try force his plans, his mind changed. "We will not go raft afternoon." "No," said Mark; "nor near edge island." "We will keep sight. Is anything could see?" "The raft." "Ah! No; think, get opposite could see raft, Serendib between." "So is. No, there is nothing see; go near shore." "No." "What shall afternoon?" said Mark, went hut. Pan idly lying narrow shade fence. "We must not shoot," said Bevis, "and cannot go raft, savages prowling round, must not play cards, chopping; let us go round island explore interior." "First-rate," said Mark; "just thing; take bow arrows--you need shoot, case savages--and I will take spear case tiger reeds, something comes wave." "And hatchet," said Bevis, "to blaze way. That would chopping." "No, proper chopping. Make Pan keep close. Perhaps shall find footmarks Something--spoor, know." "Come on. Down, sir." Pan accordingly walked behind. First went looked raft, moored alder, taking care expose shore, looking behind boughs. They said would finish fitting to-morrow morning, tried think name it. Bevis said name Odyssey Ulysses' raft, Calypso gave tools make it, wove sail her loom, agreed call raft Calypso. Then tried find shorter way knoll, called Kangaroo Hill, stopped impenetrable blackthorns. As "wait-a-bit" thorns, Mark thought island could far Africa. Skirting "wait-a-bits," found hazel bushes, discovered nuts ripe, stopped filled pockets. After trouble go round old way get Kangaroo Hill, went trees Bevis cut slice bark every trunk, future could walk quickly guided blaze, would show dusk. From knoll walked across ivy-grown oak, Bevis gave Mark "bunt" it. Mark found wood-pigeon's nest (empty, course), nothing else. The oak large old, tall, seemed decaying; indeed, hollow he thrust his spear, rouse creature lair. There nothing oak. Bevis looked bark trunk, see wild beast left marks claws climbing up, cats do, trace. They went farther wood direction Pan run away Bevis, found sometimes open sometimes much encumbered undergrowth. Nothing appeared trampled, find spoor. Pan showed excitement, simply following, supposed whatever gone. After awhile found trees thinner ground declined, hollow ash, short much decayed within, hive, rather nest bees. There shrill hum round bees continually went out, returning straight lines, radiating parts compass, care venture near. They appeared hive-bees, wild bees, swarm wandered mainland. How take honey easily settled, till thought making powder-monkey, smoking out, rather stupefying way hives taken home brimstone match. By damping gunpowder forming cake would burn slowly send dense fumes, would answer sulphur. Then could chop way honeycomb. Seeing tomtit bough watching chance take bee one alighted he went in, considered sign mainland Africa, honey-bird. Several tall spruce firs grew lower down, could see New Sea south-east towards unknown river. Here sat shade cracked nuts. One two bees came burdock flowered far feet, besides hum passed sound, light south-east air, playing tops firs, idle sing. Yet motion air, coming water, sufficient cool shade. Far away trunks could see jungle mainland. Just below, shore island, large willow-tree overthrown tempest day battle, lay prone water, still attached land roots. The nuts juicy sweet, day pleasant Bevis presently put nuts extended his back. High hung long brown cones fir, dark green branches seemed deepen blue sky. With half-closed eyes he gazed azure, till Mark feared he would go sleep. "Tell story," he said. "I will tickle you, tell story. Here is parrot's feather." It wood-pigeon's, knocked bird struck branch his rude haste. Mark tickled Bevis's face neck. "Tell story," he said. "My grandpa man stories," said Bevis. "If ask tell story his walking-stick, he will tell it, two three more; must careful ask walking-stick one first, he will give five shillings." "Regular moke," said Mark. "He stumped London stick bundle, did not he, made five millions money?" "Heaps that." "Now tell story." "Tickle then--very nicely." "Now go on." Volume Three, Chapter V. NEW FORMOSA--THE STORY OF THE OTHER SIDE. "Once upon time," said Bevis, closing his eyes now, "there great traveller went sailing round every sea--" "Except New Sea," said Mark. "Yes, except New Sea found, went riding lands countries, climbing mountains, tramping forests, shooting elephants Indians sticking pigs, skinning boa-constrictors, finding magicians--" "What magicians do?" "O! nothing particular, one turned tree chopped burned bonfire walked smoke, little things like that; he went spying everywhere, learned everything, and--" "Go on--what next?" "He went till he said good, went biggest forest ever walked three years--" "Like Africa?" "Just like it; climbed mountain, day two got top; sailed across sea, greatest sea ever was, came side six months so; matter did, always end it." "Very stupid." "Very stupid, very; he got tired always coming side. He hate side, he used dawdle forests lose his way, he used pull sails let ship go anyhow, never touch helm. But use he always dawdled forest awhile, and--" "The wind always took ship somewhere." "Yes, hateful side, he got miserable he know, he could stop still well--nobody stop still--and that is people got way spinning heels countries, I forget names--" "Dervishes?" "Dervishes course; well, he became Dervish, used spin round round furiously, know top always runs down, he got side again." "Stupid." "Awful stupid. Now tell else he could help coming side?" said Bevis. "But it is telling story." "O! put in." "Well," said Mark, "if walk across island, come side, sail New Sea Pinta, swim Serendib, climb fir-tree cones--" "Always side," continued Bevis, "and he said little world he hated it, could go round earth come back meet house home time." "It is big, it?" said Mark. "Nothing big could go round like that." "No, quicker get round smaller is, though it is thousands thousands miles, he said; he set find place he could wander never get side, he walked across Persia Khorasan Beloochistan--" "And Afghanistan?" "Yes, crossed Indus Ganges, Himalayas, inquired every temple wise men live caves hang hooks stuck backs--" "Fakirs." "At last old man took pity him, seeing miserable he was, whispered go, he went on--" "Where?" "To Thibet." "But nobody allowed enter Thibet." "No; he pass-word, aged man whispered him, let come in, he wandered long while, time he getting old could walk fast, took longer longer get side time. Till last, inquiring temples he went, promised show forest side. But he bathe purified first, burned incense lot magical things--" "In circles?" "I suppose so. And one night darkness, he see way went, led along, morning he narrow valley wall across could go farther valley, could climb up, rocks steep. Now, came wall he saw little narrow bronze door it--very low narrow--and door covered carvings curious inscriptions--" "Magic?" "Yes, magic. And man showed him, wore crimson robe, his white beard flowed nearly ground--I sure right, flowed nearly ground, grandpa said--the old man went door spoke language he understand voice answered, he saw door open little way, chink. Then he go his hands knees, press his head neck chink bronze door wall, he could see country side it. Though may wander straight thousand years, ten thousand years, never get side, always go on, go on, go on--" "And like?" "Well, air clear he certain he could see least hundred miles plain, see twenty miles sea top cliff. But cliff, level plain, he could see least hundred miles. Now, behind he left sun shining brightly, he could feel hot sunshine his back--" "Just I foot I fishing shadow?" "Very likely--he could feel hot sunshine his back. But inside wall sun--" "No sun?" "No. Ever far away, hung sun looks hung like lamp hill Jack's house--ever far away high up, opal star. It large star bright could see beams light shooting it, soft gentle pleasant could look straight without hurting eyes, see flashes change exactly like opal--a beautiful great opal star. All air seemed full soft light star, trees plants ground even seemed float it, like island seems float water still, shadow--" "_No_ shadow?" "No. Nothing cast shadow, light came round everything, he put his hand cast shadow, instead his hand looked transparent, light underneath it--" "Go on." "And among trees," said Bevis, pouring story his memory word word, exactly he heard it, like water pitcher filled spring, "among trees blue sky came stood it, close could see it, farther blue like mist forest, could see shimmered blue like blue-bells copse. "He could see thousands flowers, he forgot like except one like dome gold larger temple he ever seen. The grass grew round tall he could see stalk, looked hung sky, though gold he could see see blue side looked purple gold, opal star reflected dome. Nor could he remember trees, much look at, except one jointed stem like bamboo grew far bronze door. This one rose up, up, till he could strain his neck back see top, large round round summer-house home, transparent, could see sap bubbling rushing inside running stream, sweet odour came like rain boughs above. "Now, he straining his neck try see top tree, his eyes turned away opal sun, he could see stars heaven, immediately heard flute organ. For stars--which like stars--were scattered about, built golden pipes tubes; twelve tubes, stars, one larger other, behind pipes, behind others tier tier. Only twelve front, rest he could count, flute sound came filled transport he quite forgot himself, lived music. At last his neck wearied looking up, he looked again, instantly he hear starry organ, saw instead opal sun, shimmering sky among trees. "From bronze door footpath leading out, out, winding little, always out, clear air, though footpath, he could trace nearly half hundred miles he could see. The footpath strewn leaves fallen trees, oval-pointed leaves, crimson, gold, black, marks them. "One lying close bronze door, he put his hand through, know, he stretched reached it, he held light opal sun came it--it transparent--and he could see words written he read, told secret tree fallen. "Now, leaves strewn footpath secret written it--a magic secret trees, plants, birds, stars, opal sun--every one magic secret it, might go first picking one another, till travelled hundred miles, another hundred miles, thousand years, ten thousand years, always fresh secret fresh leaf. "Or might sit one trees whose branches came ground like weeping ash home, might climb another--but matter how, took hold leaves turned aside, light opal sun came through, could read magic secret every one, would take fifty years read one tree. Some leaves strewed footpath, lay grass, floated water, decay, one he held his hand went throb, throb, like pulse wrist. "And secret secret might wander, always new secret, till went beyond horizon, another horizon, another, could go on, on, though could walk ever without weariness, air pure delicious, still could never, never, never get side. "Some walking millions years, sitting trees, lying golden dome flowers time, never found never find side, happy. They sleep, never feel sleepy; turn opal sun look stars music begins, plays become strong, go gathering leaves, travelling towards opal sun, nearer get happier are, yet never get it. "While he looked he felt he must get go too, he struggled struggled, bronze door hard wall hard, use. His mind though soul gone through; he saw white shoulder, like alabaster, pure, white, transparent among grass golden dome flower, white arm stretched towards him, white gleamed polished, white hand, soft, warm-looking, delicious, transparent white, beckoning him. So he struggled struggled till seemed he would get his soul, gone footpath, aged man behind dragged back, bronze door shut awful resonance--" "What that?" "Hark!" "Hark!" Mark seized his spear; Bevis his bow. "Is something coming wave?" "No, it is sky." "Listen!" There whirr like wheels air, creaking sound it. They stood up, could see was, though grew louder came nearer rushing noise. Suddenly something white appeared trees concealed approach, swan passed descending. It noise wings creaking sounded like wheels. The great bird descended aslant quite quarter mile water south front them, floated among glittering ripples. "I thought roc," said Mark, sitting again. "Or genie," said Bevis. "What creaking whirring made!" Rooks' wings often creak go like stiff leather, noise swan's flight audible mile more. "Go story," said Mark. "It is finished." "But he pulled back? Did not he burst door open?" "He could not. When he pulled back night side wall, sudden change made bewildered led away he walking his sleep temple." "What he magic leaf he his hand?" "O! wind bronze door slammed blew his hand. But he came began reproach pulling away he time even look, told he looking three days third night door shut--" "I see--it went quick." "It went quick, like go sleep wake next minute, it is morning. But he came he found his right hand he put cast shadow changed, white smooth soft, hand his face (as he old) wrinkled hard, he quite sure he seen real true." "Did not he try go back find door." "Of course he did. But nothing jungle, he could find narrow valley; would show way again. They told one let every thousand years, reason careful people shall enter Thibet may stumble bronze door." "And became him?" "O! he lived oldest man ever was, he breathed delicious air, his hand always white soft like Frances's. Every night he went sleep, he could hear star flute music organ, dreamed he could see it; he could hear plainly. At last he died went join his soul, travelled footpath, know, towards opal sun." "How stupid keep door shut, never let one find it!" "Ah, do not see reason open people could find it, would run squeeze through, one other, like sheep gap, till world left empty without anybody it, told reason. Grandpa says pleasant thought least one goes thousand years; one, something. My grandpa told story, son man told him--I mean man looked through, else his grandson his great-great-grandson, I know long time ago. And side place." "Let us go there," said Mark, pause, "you me, take powder blow door open." "If could find it." "O! could find it; let us go Thibet." "So will." "And blow bronze door open." "And read magic leaves." "And go footpath." "And talk people golden dome flowers." "I am sure _we_ could find door." "We _will_ find it." "Very soon." "Some day." Watching swan among glittering ripples, cracked rest nuts, get go till sun getting low. It wild swan, one whose feathers clipped. The wind rose little, sighed dreamily tops tall firs walked them. They returned along shore weeds came island, gone way, Mark suddenly caught hold Bevis drew behind bush. Volume Three, Chapter VI. NEW FORMOSA--THE MATCHLOCK. "What it?" said Bevis. "I saw savage." "Where?" "In sedges shore there," pointing across weeds. "I saw his head--he hat on." "Quite sure?" Bevis looked, could see anything. "Almost nearly quite sure." They watched sedges long time, saw nothing. "Was Charlie, Val, Cecil?" "No, I do not think so," said Mark. "They could get round either," said Bevis. "If crossed Nile like did, could get round." "No." "It could anybody." "I thought was; perhaps crow flew up--it looked black." "Sure crow. The sedges move." "No, mistake--they could not get here." They went found wild bullace. "This wonderful island ever was," said Bevis; "there is always something new it. The swan--I shall shoot swan. No, likely it is sacred, king country would us hunted killed it." "And tied stake tortured." "Melted lead poured mouths, shot sacred swan leaden bullets." "Awful. No, do not shoot it. There currant-trees island too--I have seen them, there is gooseberry bush top old willow I saw," said Mark. "Of course bananas; breadfruit-trees here?" "Certain somewhere." "Melons oranges." "Of course, grapes--those grapes," pointing bryony-berries, "and pomegranates olives." "Yams everything." "Everything. I wonder Pan bark time--I wonder anything gone," said Bevis reached stockade. Pan bark, nothing missing. They set work make tea roast moorhens, determined tea supper together. The tea ready long moorhens, time finished moon shining brightly, though flecks cloud. They could course play cards, Bevis got his journal; put honey-bird, swan, discoveries made, went make list trees plants island, birds came it. They seen small flock seven eight missel-thrushes pass afternoon, Mark said birds came unknown river, flew towards north-north-west. This direction waste, wild pasture. "Then must mainland way," said Bevis; "and I expect inhabited ploughed, sown corn, that is birds like time year." "And way--where come from--must pathless jungle," said Mark. "And rest moment cross ocean. It far one fly." "My journal ought written palm leaves," said Bevis, "a book like proper: let us get leaves to-morrow see write them." "Do not shipwrecked people write shirts," said Mark, "and people put prison?" "So do--of course: shirts flannel, stupid!" "I know," said Mark, "there is collars." He went hut brought linen collars, ceased wear. Bevis tried write these, ink ran sank in, all. "Wrong ink," he said, "we must make charcoal--lampblack--and oil. You use like paint, cannot blot it, must wait till dries on." "No oil," said Mark. "I wanted rub gun looked, none--we forgot it." "Yellow-hammers," said Bevis, turning his journal again; "what yellow-hammers?" "Unknown birds," said Mark. "We do not know half birds--nobody ever put name them, nobody ever seen them: call them, let us see--gold-dust birds--" "And greenfinches?" "Ky-wee--Ky-wee," said Mark, imitating greenfinches' call. "That capital--Ky-wees," said Bevis. "There is horse-matcher here," said Mark. The horse-matcher bold hedge-hawk butcher bird. "The one sticks humble-bees thorns." "Bee-stickers--no, bee-killers: that is down," said Bevis. Besides he wrote nettle-creepers (white-throats), goldfinch, magpie, chaffinch, tree-climber, kestrel-hawk, linnets, starlings, parrots, parrakeets. "I shall get early to-morrow morning," he said. "I will load matchlock to-night, I want shoot heron." He loaded matchlock ball, soon afterwards let curtain door, went bed, Bevis repeating "Three of the clock, three of the clock, three of the clock," first aloud himself, set clock his mind wake hour. Not long asleep, Pan usual went his ramble. Bevis's clock duly woke three, lifting his head he could see light chinks curtain, he half inclined go sleep again, stayed another quarter hour. Then he resolutely bent conquer sleep, slipped bed, put his boots quietly, wake Mark. Taking matchlock, he went found light, light moon mingling dawn, misty. A dry vapour, left dew, filled wood short distance path seemed go lose mist. Bevis went round island, following path made. On Serendib side he neither saw heard anything, he came back shore, lark began sing far away mainland, afterwards he heard querulous cry peewit. He walked cautiously, likely side find heron, whether heard his approach saw him, see almost far man standing, lifting long necks, he find any. When he reached spot "blaze" began led Kangaroo Hill, he fancied he saw something move water long way mist. He stopped behind bush watched, minute he sure something, perhaps cluck. He set rest, blew match, opened lid pan, knelt looked along barrel till he got line object. If gun loaded shot he would fired once, though indistinct vapour he thought within range, he ball, he wanted see would come nearer, he knew he could depend bullet thirty yards. Intent object, seemed swimming, he began curious know was, come little closer, he could see duck, neck; big rat: must creature visited island took food--the idea shooting animal surprising Mark delighted him. He aimed along barrel, got sight exactly creature, he thought he would let get yards closer, he depressed muzzle trifle, remembering coming towards him, he aim somewhat front ball would go over. Now near enough he sure--he aimed steadily, his finger began draw match he caught sight creature's eye. It Pan. "Pan!" said Bevis. He got up, spaniel swam steadily towards him. "Where been, sir?" he said sternly. Pan crouched his feet, even shaking first. "You rascal--where been?" Bevis inclined thrash him, he angry mistake he almost made, angry dog he almost shot him. But Pan crouched close ground his feet he strike him. "It frightened herons," he said. Pan instantly recognised change tone his voice, sprang up, jumped round, barked, shook water his shaggy coat. It use evidently think shooting heron, spaniel alarmed Bevis returned hut. He woke Mark, told him. "That is he is lazy morning," said Mark. "Do not recollect? He sleeps morning." "And will not eat anything." "I believe he is home," said Mark. "Very likely Polly throws bones still his house." "That is it: old glutton!" said Bevis. Pan jumped bed, licked Mark, jumped Bevis's knees, leaving marks his wet paws, sand adhered, he barked wagged his tail much say, "Am I clever?" "O! yes," said Mark, "you are knowing, will not again." "No, will not, sir," said Bevis. "You will tied to-night." "Tight tight," said Mark. "Just think," said Bevis. "He must swum channel came catamaran. Why it is hundred fifty yards--" "Or two hundred--only shallow. Perhaps he could bottom part--" "But far--and run way home, way back, swim again." "A regular voyage--and every night too." "You false old greedy Pan!" "To leave us thought watching slept." "To desert post, faithless sentinel." Pan looked one other, he understood every word; he rolled whites his eyes looked pious, burst fits laughter. Pan wagged his tail barked doubtfully; he shrewd suspicion laughing him, he like it. In fact, flesh-pots attracted Pan his post led traverse sea land, undergo immense exertion, speak friend his. They thought use go sleep now, lit fire, prepared breakfast. By time ready mist begun clear; sky became blue overhead, sitting table awning, first beams shot along Serendib knees. Bevis said breakfast he practise matchlock, till he could hit something bullets. Mark wanted explore unknown river, agreed do, difficulty, usual, dinner, nothing larder bacon rashers, almost gone. Rashers become wearisome, ten times wearisome cook too. Bevis said he must write his letter home--he afraid he might delayed long--and take Loo post night, he would write list things, Loo could buy town, potted meats, tongues, soups, would save cooking, quite proper. But Mark got difficulty supposing fetched wreck went pieces. So swim, Bevis set his target--a small piece paper black spot, inch diameter, inked centre--on teak, fired his first shot forty yards. The ball missed teak-tree altogether, heard crash bramble bush way beyond. Bevis went five yards nearer next time, bullet hit tree low down, two feet beneath bull's-eye. Then he tried thirty yards, before, he practised, ball hit tree five six inches lower mark. He tried four times distance, every time bullet struck beneath, seemed gun threw ball low. Some guns throw shot high, low, he supposed matchlock threw low. So he aimed fifth time centre, ball grazed bark tree right-hand side much Mark's done. Bevis stepped five yards nearer, he could hit twenty-five yards, he think would his fault. He aimed direct piece paper, five inches square, bullet struck three inches beneath, though nearly line, is, line drawn middle paper would passed little left bullet hole. This better, he tried five yards closer, appeared improve every advance, ball hit paper lower right-hand edge. Examining bullet holes bark tree, noticing low right-hand side, Bevis tried think could be. He quite certain he aimed perfectly straight, he accustomed puff priming, disconcert him. He kept his gaze steadily along barrel till actual explosion occurred, smoke muzzle obscured view. It must something gun itself. Bevis put rest unloaded, aimed along, pulled trigger, he would done he really shoot. Nothing seemed wrong. As heavy barrel supported rest, stock pressed firm his shoulder, pulling trigger depress muzzle often rifles. He aimed again, he saw top sight must because. The twisted wire elevated eighth inch, he aimed he got tip sight bear paper, that, instead his glance passing level along barrel, rose slightly, breech top sight. The barrel yard long, top sight line object, muzzle depressed exactly eighth inch. An eighth inch one yard, quarter two yards, three eighths three yards, four half inch, eight inch, sixteen two inches, twenty-four three inches. This nearly enough account continual misses. In gun properly made, breech thicker muzzle, greater thickness, like slight elevation, corrects sight; gun, too, adjusted. But matchlock thickness end end, till now, tried determine accuracy shooting. Bevis got file filed sight, till sixteenth inch high, loading again, he aimed way sight cover spot he wished strike. He could see sides sight, exact spot he wanted hit hidden it. He fired, ball struck paper inch two inches right centre. Next time bullet hit nearly level centre, still right side. This deflection he could account for, sight proper position, he certain he aimed correctly. But last he compelled acknowledge deflection, persuaded allow it. He aimed least degree left bull's-eye--just apparent width sight--and he could see bull's-eye right, sight well up. He covered bull's-eye first sight, slightly moved barrel till bull's-eye appeared right side, visible. The ball struck within half inch bull's-eye. Bevis delighted. He fired again, ball almost hit centre. Next time bullet hit preceding bullet, flattened it. Then Mark tried, ball went within mere trifle bull's-eye. Bevis found individual ways his gun. He like allowing deflection, use, done, he soon became reconciled concession. The matchlock coaxed like sailing-boat ironclads, like fortune Frances. Bevis delighted discovery, he fired bullet bullet, Mark trying every then, till paper riddled bullet holes, teak-tree coated lead. He thought he would try longer range, went back thirty-five yards, though he allowed little more, tried several ways, use, bullet could relied on. At twenty yards could hit bull's-eye, sparrow, even wren, would safe; beyond that, errors crept Bevis could correct. These probably caused irregularities rough bore barrel, iron tube. When powder exploded, power explosion drove ball, sheer force, almost perfectly straight--point-blank--for twenty twenty-five yards. Then twist given inequalities bore, gained ball rubbing them, began tell; sometimes one way, sometimes another, ball became deflected hardly twice way. Bevis obliged content accuracy twenty, twenty-five yards. At twenty he could hit object size sparrow; twenty-five blackbird, twenty-five he might miss his straw hat. Still great triumph found secret, certain hitting even short range. "Why, that is Jack's rifle!" he said. "It is dodge find out." "Of course is; he would lend us, soon master it," said Mark. "And let us go unknown river." Volume Three, Chapter VII. NEW FORMOSA--SWEET RIVER FALLS. The matchlock slung hut, away went raft; Pan want come, he tired his journey night, made him. Knowing position shoals, could touch bottom poles, not, got along much quicker, entered channel weeds, discovered beyond Pearl Island Pinta. The channel often narrow, turned several ways, degrees trended south-eastwards, farther penetrated it, numerous became banks, covered dense growth sedges flags. Some higher water others, bushes willows, that, awhile, view open sea behind cut off. They see wild-fowl, heard splash poles, swam away hid. Winding round sedge-grown banks, presently heard sound falling water. "Niagara!" said Mark. "No, Zambesi. There houses Niagara, it is good." "No. Look!" The raft glided channel small open bay, free weeds, woods side. Where narrowed little stream fell two short leaps, worn way sandstone. The water much ran hatch brook near home, this, coming stone rock, instead dropping nearly straight, leaped forward broke spray. The sides worn channel green moss, beneath, surface water, long cool hart's-tongue ferns grew, sprinkled every moment. The boughs beech-trees met fall, shaded water below. They poled near spray reached raft; Mark caught hold drooping beech bough, moored vessel. They could see stream farther yards, overhung dark fir boughs. On firs grey flecks lichen. "How sweet clear looks!" said Bevis. "Shall call Sweet River?" "And Sweet River Falls?" "Yes. It comes jungle," Bevis looked edge raft, saw arch water dive unbroken beneath surface pool, rise innumerable bubbles him. The hart's-tongue ferns vibrated, swinging slightly, weight drops bore slipped off, let up. By shore pool turquoise studs forget-me-nots, golden centres, brighter darkness shade. So thick boughs, sky could seen them; rustle light south-east wind blew, underneath leaves move. "I like this," said Mark. He sat chest, locker, holding beech bough. "But birds sing." The cuckoo gone, nightingale silent, finches stubble, might chiff-chaff "chip-chipping," perhaps deep jungle, one pair doves quite finished nesting New Formosa, parties greenfinches called "ky-wee, ky-wee," single lark sang early dawn. But jungle silent. There song waterfall. Though breath wind boughs, yet sound fall rose, declined, water ran swifter less speed. Sometimes like tinkling; sometimes laughed; sometimes like voices far away. It ran woods message, hastening tell it, became confused. Bevis sat raft, leaning willow bulwark; Pan crept his knee. The forget-me-nots hart's-tongue, beeches firs, listened singing. Something gone by, something come, came music made moment sweeter. This moment singing held thousand years gone by, thousand years come. For woods waters old, past; look sky know thousand years hence nothing it, future. But forget-me-nots, hart's-tongue, beeches, think ages gone, azure come. They _now_, sunshine wind above, shadow water spray beneath, all. Bevis Mark now, listening singing, all. Presently sound--a "swish"--and looking up, saw pheasant his tail behind like comet, flying straight sea. This awoke them. Bevis held palm his hand, Pan came nearer put his chin hollow it, he done hundreds times. Pan looked up, wagged his tail, thump, thump, deck raft. If could put intelligence dog body horse, size, speed, grace, animal would be! "Lots perch here," said Mark; "I shall come fish. Suppose land go Sweet River?" "It belongs king country, I expect," said Bevis. "He sits throne ebony golden footstool, wave fans peacocks' feathers, room lit single great diamond top dome ceiling, flashes sunshine through, outside. The swan belongs him." "And he keeps Sweet River drink from, executes everybody dares drink it," said Mark. Just bird flew noiselessly beech them, saw jay, kept quite still. The next instant he off, heard his friends, jay never alone, screeching jungle. Looking back towards quiet bay, appeared raining fast, without sound, surface dimpled innumerable tiny circlets like caused raindrops. These left midges danced water, touching then. "Did hear that?" It sound distant gun shorn smartness report trees. "The savages matchlocks," said Bevis. "They must ever much dangerous thought." "Perhaps we would better go," said Mark, casting beech bough. The current slowly drifted raft bay, took poles, returned along channel reeds sedge banks. It took time reach New Formosa. "I wonder creature wave been," said Mark. "Suppose go quietly see is." "So will." Keeping Pan close heels, stole along path stockade, crept behind gateway, suddenly burst in. "Ah!" "Here he is." "Yow-wow!" "O! it is pheasant!" "Only pheasant!" The pheasant, flying straight sea cornfields, halted New Formosa, attracted glimpse he caught fence hut. The enclosure seemed much like he bred, he enjoyed much food, he came rambled inside, visiting even cave, stepping table. When came unexpectedly him, he rose rocket-like, first made towards jungle, minute, recovering himself, he swept round went mainland Waste. He want return preserves--anywhere else preference. While dinner preparing, Mark got his fishing-rod, fitted spinning tackle pike, he meant angle round island, also hooks trimmers, he could catch bait, hooks nightlines, case eels. These trimmers nightlines put mind traps kangaroos, traps, determined set wires good distance knoll, not, case, interfere shooting. After dinner, Mark wanted go fishing, Bevis watched Charlie, looking telescope, saw herd buffaloes green hill sycamore-trees. One cow held her head low, friend licked her poll. A flock rooks slope, he known, he could told way wind blew, faced one direction, always walk meet breeze. When flew he knew Charlie approaching. Charlie stay making signal, Bevis went walked round island till he found Mark. As yet, Mark success, he fixed spot set nightlines. Returning along shore, fishing he went, Bevis him, remembered night letter must taken Loo post, thought better look channel weeds, else moonlight might get mainland easily. The best tree climb larch grew apart wood, rose great height, balanced side long slender branches. The larch, growing alone, beautiful tree. It often crowded plantations like `Black Hole' Calcutta human beings. Up went, Mark first, quickly sailors ratlins, branches, regular intervals, grown purpose climbing, jam hats on, look higher bough on, dust bark shook down. "There is reapers," said Mark; "what lot cut." They could see sheaves stacked, stubble, lighter hue standing wheat. Every dark dots came golden surface wheat like seals breathe. These dots reapers' heads. "There is pheasant," said Bevis, pointing Waste. The bird making his way zigzag round green ant-hills, towards stubble. Sometimes he walked, sometimes he ran, he gave jump his run. They lost sight behind great grey boulder-stone, whose top visible brambles rush-bunches surrounded base. "Jack's busy hills," said Mark, looking way towards Downs. "He might well let us rifle he is busy harvest." "Just well. I say, let us explore Waste to-morrow. It wilderness--you do not know may find wilderness." "Grey stones," said Mark. "They are tombs--genii live them." "Serpents guarding treasures, lamps burning; burning ages ages--" "Awful claps thunder underground." "We go see to-morrow--I believe heaps kangaroos there." "There is channel." They could trace windings tree, marked minds. At height breeze came cool delicious; sat long silent, soothed rustle gentle sway branches. They could feel mast-like stem vibrate--it move sufficiently said bend, even sway--so slight motion eye could trace it. But move could feel hands wind came less force. When descended, Mark continued fishing till came raft. They embarked poled round island side ready start evening. Then Bevis wrote letter dating Jack's house hills. It short. He said well, jolly, come back little yet, would long--this case one go see them. But he came read mistakes, deceit he practising dear mamma stood like black ink page. "I do not like it," he said. "It is nice." "No; it is nice," said Mark, sitting him. "But still--" "But still," repeated Bevis, letter put envelope addressed. In evening sun sank Mark tried bait succeeded catching some, trimmers. Then laid night-line eels far island edge looked muddy. To fill time till quite moonlight, worked mast raft, also cut sedges flags roof open she would, put place awning. They supposed half-past nine pushed raft, taking letter, list things got town save labour cooking, flag-basket. The trimmers dropped went. Mark going wait raft till Bevis returned original plan, agreed would much pleasant go together, raft would perfectly safe. They found channel without difficulty, raft grounded among sedges, stepped out, first time landed mainland. As walked saw fern owl floating along hedge stubble. The beetles hummed came heedlessly hedge become entangled leaves. They walked close hedge knew brightest moonlight like day. By moonlight object standing apart seen long distance, anything background hedge cannot distinguished certain across one wide field. That something moving may ascertained, exact character cannot determined. As travel beside hedges make frequent detours, occupied time reach cottage, approached field back. When near enough, Bevis whistled--the notes he Mark called signalled other. In instant saw Loo come window, quickly she must sleeping her dress on; she slipped lean-to little she would it, scrambled gap thin hedge, ran them. She sat watched listened whistle night night vain. At last she drew her cot (in her little brother also slept) across window, left window open. Her mind long expecting whistle responded moment sound reached her dreaming ear. She took letter (with penny stamp) list basket, promised things ready following evening. "And remember," said Bevis, "remember do not say anything. There shilling do not tell--" "I should not tell wurdn't shilling," said Loo. "You mind say word," added Mark. "Nobody know seen us." "Good-night," said Bevis, away went. Loo watched till lost dark background hedge, returned her cot, scrambling roof she would window. They got back island without difficulty, felt quite certain one seen them. Stirring embers fire, made tea, half cold damper eat it. This day fared worse day since arrived New Formosa. They tired make fresh damper (besides time would take) got early morning, Bevis entered two words his journal--"Monday--Loo." Then fastened Pan door-post, allowing enough cord move yards, taking care make his collar tight slip his head. Pan submitted mournful countenance, well he understood he served way. Volume Three, Chapter VIII. NEW FORMOSA--THE MAINLAND. In morning, bath, Mark examined night-line, untouched; kangaroo wires set runs. Poling raft trimmers found jack two pounds one, bait another carried off, third visited. Bevis wanted explore Waste, especially look great grey boulder, went landed among sedges. Making Pan keep close heels, cautiously crept bramble thickets--Pan tried two three times break away, scent game strong thickets--and entered wild pasture, across could see. The ground undulated, besides large ant-hills, scattered hawthorn bushes thickets round boulders intercepted view. If savages appeared intended stoop, would invisible; could even creep hands knees half across common without seen. Pan restless--not weary morning--the scent he crossed almost much his obedience. They reached boulder unseen--indeed one see them-- pushed bushes, stood it. The ponderous stone smooth, ground emery, little circular basins cups drilled it. With stick Bevis felt round came place stick could pushed two three feet stone, grass. "It is hollow here," he said; "you try." "So is," said Mark. "This treasure is." "And serpent, magic lamp burning ages ages." "If could lift stone up." "There is spell it; could not lift up, levers anything." Pan sniffed narrow crevice edge boulder ground--concealed grass till Bevis found it--but showed interest. There rabbit there. Such great boulders often crevices beneath, whether natural hollow, whether boulder capstone dolmen known. Whirr-rr! A covey partridges flew stone, within inches heads concealed it. They counted fourteen--the covey went straight across New Sea, eastwards towards Nile. From boulder wandered among ant-hills tall thistles, disturbing hare, went tremendous pace, bringing his hind legs right his body his shoulder his eagerness take kangaroo bounds. Presently came thick hedge divided Waste cornfields. Gathering blackberries along this, came gate, alarmed them, thinking one might see, careful reconnaissance showed reapers finished left field. The top bar gate pecked, little chips wood, crows been. "It is nice here," said Mark. "You go without coming Other Side soon." After life island, could never walk far without coming sight water, appreciated liberty mainland. Pan several kicks bangs stick, he tempted rush hedge, want bark, case one hear. "Lots kangaroos here," said Bevis, "and big kangaroos too--hares know; I say, I shall come matchlock night." "So will." There gap corner, came idling along got double mound, Bevis, first, suddenly dropped his knees seized Pan's shaggy neck. Mark crouched instantly behind him. "What it?" he whispered. "Some one's here." "How know?" "Sniff." Mark sniffed. There strong pungent smell crushed nettles. He understood moment--some one recently gone trampled them. They remained position five minutes, hardly breathing, afraid move. "I cannot hear one," whispered Mark. "No." "Must gone on." Bevis crept forward, still holding Pan one hand; Mark followed, crossed mound, signs one recently became visible trampled nettles, one spot imprint heel-plate. "Savages," said Bevis. "Ah! Look." Mark looked branches long way stubble, moving among shocks wheat, he saw Bevis's governor. They watched silently. The governor walked straight away; scarcely breathed till he disappeared next field. Then drew back Waste, looked one another. "Very nearly done," said Mark. "We will not land daylight," said Bevis. "No--it is safe; he must close." "He must got mound looked through," said Bevis. "Perhaps gate." "Most likely. He came across stubble, he side this." "Awfully nearly done; must governor startled partridges!" "Stupes know one about." "Awful stupes." They walked back raft, keeping close hedge, crept fours among ant-hills pass gateway without possibility seen, though knew governor far observe them. The governor look progress made reapers, strolled across stubble, thinking see birds about, great till season opened. Coming mound, he got looked Waste, (as New Sea) he held manorial rights. At moment he looking pasture idly approaching along hedge, he stopped would come him. As was, he went back stubble, gone fifty yards his back turned entered gap. "We might tortured," said Mark, stepped raft. "Tied gimlets bored heads." "The king country awful tyrant," said Bevis. "Very likely he would fixed us hollow tree smeared us honey let flies eat us." "Unless could save his daughter, ill, magicians cannot her good." "Now hoping shall soon come wonderful talisman. We must study magic--we keep putting off; I wonder really jewel toad's head." "You inked wizard's foot gateway," said Mark. When got home Bevis inked boards gate; he could rough bark gate-post. They worked she would, soon put place awning, taken carried raft. Next mast erected, sustained stays; was, however, taken again, way till required, stowed side bulwarks. The jack cooked dinner, though enough hungry people pleasant change perpetual rashers damper. After Charley given signal, parted; Mark took his perch tackle poled raft near Pearl Island, he thought he might catch perch. Bevis loaded matchlock ball, went ambush behind ash-tree Kangaroo Hill, try shoot kangaroo. Mark took Pan worked raft along till he within forty fifty yards Pearl Island, windward side. The wind changeable lately, showing weather settled been; blew eastward afternoon, strong enough ripple. When he got raft position he wished, Mark put pole took his rod. The raft, he designed, floated slowly, without least disturbance water (such his pole oars would caused) wind, till grounded shoal ten yards Pearl Island. Mark knew shoal, noticed place visiting islets, thought would likely spot find perch. The ripples breaking ridge shoal made miniature surf there. On outer windward side perch would watch anything might come along wavelets, inside whatever might washed shoal. There weeds short distance, none there, places clear sandy bottom favourite haunts perch waters like these. First he fished outside windward, his blue float went ripples till presently went single dive, drawn eager fish. In minute he perch board half pound weight, shortly afterwards another, third, perch feed take bait directly fast put them. Now Mark, though excited his luck, cool enough observe one little precaution, use fresh clean worm every time, drop one least degree mauled. This required self-control, several times bait scarcely damaged, rule he Bevis found out, always adhered it. For fish likes antipathies exactly creatures, one approaches bait turns disdainfully away quite probable three four may check advance, whether imitation, taking opinion first guide themselves. So Mark always fresh, untainted bait them, short time he six perch raft. He put locker. There pause, he exhausted school. Next he tried fishing towards nearest weeds, small bunch utmost limit his throw, half hour elapsed he nibble he tried inside shoal leeward. In five minutes he landed fine one, quite two pounds half, whose leaps went thump, thump deck like Pan's tail. Ten minutes he caught another, time small, his last. There either fish, credence. He sat locker watched his float till sun grew low, use. He knew use long before, still he lingered. Gold-diggers linger though know claim exhausted. The mind loth acknowledge game up. Mark knew up; still he waited let his float uselessly rise fall, till he heard report matchlock island, he poled homewards see Bevis shot. In ambush, ash-tree, behind fringe fern--one frond scorched Mark fired it--Bevis watched gun ready rest. He purposely gone little soon, is, shadow stretched right across glade, arrive till last moment kangaroo may already out, alarmed. Then necessary wait till others recover fear; one runs in, sound his hasty passage tunnels ground conveys information bury. Not far bunch beautiful meadow geraniums; blue cups already dropped, leaving elongated seed-vessel crane's bill, something like pointed caps worn mediaeval ladies. The leaves much divided; perhaps wind-anemone leaves (but withered long since) finely divided, hold one shadow may cast sun piece white paper, cannot choose admire it. While he sat there, changing position limb utmost care deliberation, rustle grass attract attention moving quickly (for kangaroos heed anything moves slowly), he saw brown furze-chat come tall fern perch sideways flattened yellow stalk. Half hour afterwards came sound like "top-top" oak his left hand--not ivy-grown one--and he great exertion turned round, difficult turn still occupy space, he followed branches oak cautiously till he found bird. If glance, were, broadcast tree leaf, see nothing, though bird's note may fall overhead. Bevis first looked quickly larger leading branches, letting his glance run them; he caused travel along lesser boughs one great branch, another, till he exhausted all. Still he could find it, though he heard "top-top." But he got map tree his eye, moment bird moved he saw it. It ran partly dead branch, stopped struck beak, though bird larger sparrow sound vehement blows could heard across glade. He saw white red colour, glimpse he short notice much. The spotted woodpecker hasty often he sight half minute. Bevis saw fly flight like finch across ivy-grown oak, heard his "top-top" thence. One tits trick tapping branches much manner he seen sound may mistaken. There little rabbit out, worth shooting. Restless Bevis was, yet moment he fixed his mind thing his magnetised nerves sinews. He became still tree scarcely heeded lapse time. Bees went by, reminded honey hollow ash, he heard mice fern. The shadows deepened, two thrushes blackbird grass. Another little kangaroo appeared, third, long way off, far shoot, one three parts grown, he hoped would presently feed within range. After while, happen, he began think he would try shoot two smaller ones once. With shot could easily done, often close together. As he watching young rabbits, asking whether ball would strike both, sense something moving made glance oak his left hand. He actually see anything go it, corner his eye--while he consciously gazing straight forward--was aware something passed. In moment he saw jay, come without sound, though jay makes screech he opens his bill, his wings almost noiseless owl's. A wood-pigeon makes great clatter, hammering air boughs; jay slips tree without sound. The bird's back turned, white bar across showed; moment he moved, blue wing visible. "Frances would like it," Bevis thought, "to put her hat." The ferns hid side, careless rabbits, he gently moved round; little kangaroos lifted heads, larger one ran his bury, bring his gun bear oak Bevis obliged expose towards knoll. Now he round difficulty, jay high oak, rest low. To aim tree he must extended full length his chest ground, would awkward, likely he he startle bird. He gently lifted heavy matchlock, sliding barrel bark ash till he position, holding pressing his left hand tree. This gave support his wrist fresh, minute he knew would feel weight, perhaps tremble. It necessary shoot quick reason, jay never stays long one tree; yet he wanted take steady aim. He shot anything matchlock, though he designed it. Bevis brought barrel bear, covered jay sight, moved merest trifle left, he could see bird, drew match priming. The bird struck air blow ball fell dead. The wing towards part neck carried away bullet, which, coming upwards, lifted jay bough. On side away wing uninjured; Frances. There chance getting rabbit now, he returned towards hut, many minutes Mark came running. When jay perch talked enough, made tea, sat wait till moonlight. Bevis got his journal recorded spoils, little bats flew fro inside stockade, even open she would table heads, little fear flies. Later on, landed mainland, going stubble meet Loo, saw something move, keeping quite still hedge, came towards them, knew fox. He came furrow lands, several times went nosing round shocks wheat, he looks plump mouse others kidney breakfast. He seem scent them, stepped he startled raced away full speed. At whistle Loo brought flag-basket, heavy tinned tongues potted meats ordered. She frequently sent town errands house, difficulty shop. Bevis inquired home; well, wished her good-night exacting another promise secrecy. Loo watched sight. That evening splendid supper New Formosa, sat playing cards. "How ought know governor Jolly Old Moke right," said Mark, "as we are island seven thousand miles away? Of course know, _ought_ find out? There telegraph lived." "Well, it is awkward," said Bevis--"it is awkward; perhaps magic ring looked saw people doing, or, I know! there is little looking-glass cave, do not remember?" "We brought forgot hang up." "Yes; saw magic mirror, do not see?" "Of course--like picture. First comes mist mirror, breathed it; see people moving about, likely somebody going married want, cry out, mist comes again." "That is right: I will put journal. `Made magic saw blokes home.'" They fastened Pan door-post going bed, gave several slices rolled tongue. They slept instant put heads hard doubled-up great-coats formed pillows. Volume Three, Chapter IX. NEW FORMOSA--THE SOMETHING COMES AGAIN. About middle night Pan moved, sat up, gave low growl, rushed outside full length his cord, set barking. "Pan! Pan!" said Bevis, awakened. "What it?" said Mark. Hearing voices feeling supported, Pan increased his uproar. Bevis ran outside Mark looked round stockade. It still night, night wending morn. The moon low behind trees. The stars shone white without scintillating. They could distinctly see every corner courtyard; nothing it. "It is something," said Mark. Together ran across gateway stockade, though boots on. They looked outside; nothing. Everything perfectly still, trees slept. "We left gate open," said Bevis. "I do not believe it is ever locked once," said Mark. Neither it. On boards wizard's foot drawn keep ethereal genii, neglected padlock door keep material. They locked now, returned hut. Pan wagged his tail, continued give short barks much say, _he_ satisfied, though seen nothing. "What be?" said Mark. "If Pan used swim every night, he could things." "No. We will look morning see marks ground." They sat little talking it, reclined; three minutes firm asleep again. Pan curled up, outside hut now; twice he growled inwardly. In morning remembered incident moment woke, letting Pan loose, carefully examined every foot ground inside stockade. There slightest spoor. Nor outside gate; possible animal might pass without leaving much sign thin grass. When Pan let free he ran eagerly gate, stopped, looked him, came back seeming: take interest. The scent gone. "No cooking," said Mark, sat breakfast. "Glad I am girl sort thing." "I wish wind," said Bevis, "so could sail." There little air moving, sufficient make sailing pleasant cumbrous craft Calypso. They bath, cross Serendib, lest Pan follow disturb water-fowl. So soon dressed, matchlock loaded--it Mark's day--and brought raft round. Mark sat deck front match lit, barrel balanced fixed rest put it, movable staff. Bevis poled raft across Serendib, quietly round northern end island, water deep enough let raft pass close blue gum boughs. Coming round side, Mark moved his left hand, signal agreed on, Bevis kept his pole ground, dragging almost anchor Calypso. In quarter minute Mark fired, Pan instantly jumped overboard. The force his fall carried water, he rose directly brought moorhen back them. Bevis dragged board--the moorhen his mouth--by neck, he could climb bulwarks water. After gun loaded Bevis pushed slowly, report frightened others, feeding. They stayed therefore blue gum boughs waited. Pan wanted leap ashore play havoc, would let him, impossible shoot flying heavy gun. Some time passed, Bevis caught sight neck head; nothing visible, near shore along come. It dab-chick lesser grebe. At that, stern end raft, rest, Mark sat put barrel bulwarks. Bevis whispered wait till dab-chick turned head, bird, swims almost flush water, goes instant, get his head disappear. He dive faintest sound movement he recognise, soon comes again, often duck flash gun quick shot strike him. Mark waited his chance instantly fired, Pan brought grebe. They waited seemed long time, nothing appeared, Pan thrown ashore his neck crash among "gix" meadowsweet. He care that, he went work instant. Mark got ready, though he could shoot flying he thought would perhaps swim off. This happened, two moorhens came rushing out, one flew, swam hastily he could, Mark shot latter. But he could load Pan disturbed whole island, went way, that, fowl scattered. It time could get excited spaniel board; soon could, Bevis poled raft along Bamboo Island, several coots moorhens taken refuge. As came near alert began move off. Mark aimed one, he he thought quite near enough: Bevis poled faster, moorhen splash began rise, scuttling dragging long hanging legs along surface. Mark drew match priming, shot widening went, struck water like shower round moorhen, though hit one pellet, fell dived: Pan following. The bird came breathe. Pan saw her, yelped. He touched ground ran plunging water, cantering, lifting his fore-paws beating water, he could run way ashore. He caught another glimpse bird, dashed spot, thrust his nose head right under, missed her. By raft come up, beat weeds poles. The moorhen doubled bamboos sedges, thick hindered her progress, Pan snapped her moment. From Bamboo Island, Bevis poled round five six banks covered sedges, Mark another shot, time, perhaps little confident, he missed altogether. There seem probability shooting more, returned towards New Formosa, Mark wanted one look round lower level end island. Bevis poled way, Mark, seeing something black white bill moving weeds, fired--a long shot--and felt sure he wounded bird, though minute disappeared. Presently Pan brought young coot. Mark shot three moorhens, coot, dab-chick, pleased moorhen he hit flying, though one shot taken effect. He could shot many cumbrous gun water-fowl nearly young, time gone since last raid made upon sedgy covers; that, case uninhabited islands, birds easy approach. Finding sun-dial still gave time half-past twelve, Mark wanted try spinning jack Bevis tired poling raft. Bevis willing, started again, he poled slowly along edge broad bands weeds, Mark drew bait water. He one success, bringing jack two pounds deck, more. Then, returning New Formosa, visited wires set kangaroos, forgotten. One pushed down, nothing caught. The wires moved set runs, caution touch grass run--the kangaroo's footpath--with hand, loops made little larger. If loop small rabbit pushes wire aside; better little large, head may certain go through, shoulders draw noose tight. They sit dinner till past two of the clock, long morning, part lost cooking. Watching Charlie afternoon, reclined cliff oak, resting, talking little. The light sun often intercepted, entirely shut off, intercepted thin white clouds slowly drifting over, like branches held back much rays sun could occasionally looked at. Then he came lit waters gleaming splendour. There enough ripple prevent seeing basking fish, shifting, uncertain air enough called breeze. Lying full length inside shadow oak, Bevis gazed clouds, immense height, drifted slowly scarcely seem move, he saw he fixed point edge oak boughs. So thin delicate texture white sky-lace threads scarcely hid blue eye knew behind it. It warm without pressure heat, soft, luxurious; summer like reclined, resting fulness time. The summer rested went autumn. Already tips reeds brown, leaves birch specked, willows dropped yellow ovals water; acorns bulging cups, haws showed among hawthorn green turned red; gloss blue sloes among "wait-a-bit" blackthorns, red threads appeared moss canker-roses briars. A sense rest, rest weariness, full growth, atmosphere; tree, plant, grassy things reached fulness strength. The summer shadow lingered dial, sun slowed his pace, pausing his way, rich light fruits filled. The earth listened chorus birds, ceased gave meed berry, seed, grain. There labour them; granaries full. Ethereal gold floated hills, filling hollows brim haze. Like grape air ripe luscious, breathe drowsy joy. For Circe smoothed her garment slumbered, sun moved slow. They remained idle oak time Charlie made usual signal; shadow wood came brambles towards fence Mark reloaded matchlock, went ambush Kangaroo Hill among hazel bushes time opposite side. The hazel bushes seemed quite vacant, one bird passed there, robin, come see anything him. In butchery Wars Roses, flowers stained memories! certain murderers watched robin perched hard by. He listened voice fair Rosamond; he tryst Amy Robsart met her lover. Nothing happens fields woods without robin. Mark shot last kangaroo, though Pan raced his hardest escaped bury. It use wait longer, walked slowly round island, waiting behind every bush, looking water. There nothing till, returned side, saw parrots approach descend ivy-grown oak. Bevis held Pan Mark crept forward tree-trunk tree-trunk till he near enough, he put heavy barrel tree, way Bevis done. His aim true, parrot fell. It agreed Bevis gun night, he wished go mainland see he could shoot anything Waste, still unsatisfied Mark wanted yet another shot. The thirst chase him; he could desist. Since nothing else he fired killed thrush found perched top stockade. Mark put gun sigh his shooting over. Bevis waited till full moonlight, putting things his journal, Mark skinned three his finest perch, he meant supper. To obliged cook one thing, cook pleasure taste different thing. He skinned he knew extreme difficulty scraping thickset hard scales. Presently Bevis loaded gun; he going ball, Mark pointed he could certain perfectly accurate aim moonlight. This true, he reluctantly put shot. Mark's one desire fetch his game; Bevis wished kill precision single bullet. They poled raft ashore, landed, Mark stayed among bramble thickets holding Pan, Bevis went Waste. He mean stay ambush long anywhere, try get shot behind bushes. Crouching brambles, Mark soon lost sight him, soon he seemed vanished; ant-hills, tall thistles, hawthorns concealed him. Bevis stepped noiselessly round green ant-hills, sometimes startling lark, till, he looked back, he scarcely knew way he come. In meadow cornfield smooth surface let us glance travel opposite hedge, shape enclosure one least boundaries seen, position understood. But ant-hills rush-bunches, thickets thistles brambles gave ground uneven surface, hawthorn-trees hid outline. There outline; dim uncertain expanse shadows, grey mist rising there, slight rustlings pads pressed sward, wings rose roost. Once he fancied he saw light upon ground far off; he moved way, thistles bushes hid it. A silent owl startled slipped past; he stamped his foot anger he startled. Twice he caught glimpse white tails, he could shoot running matchlock. Incessantly winding round round ant-hills, he know way he going, except he tried keep moon little his left hand, thinking he could shoot better light like that. After time he reached boulder, another one large examined together; high his chest. He leaned looked over; green waggon track side, wound bushes, disappeared among them. Though he knew Mark could far, whistle would bring him, he felt utterly alone. It wilder island-- desolate thistles, waste rushes, thorns, untouched land ants possessed man, cold grey boulder, dots mist there, pale light moon. Something mystery ancient days hovers night untilled places. He leaned stone looked flicker light he seen, supposed must will-of-the-wisp, he see again. Suddenly something came round corner smooth green waggon track, he knew instant peculiar amble hare. The long barrel matchlock cautiously placed stone, he aimed well he could, looked along barrel objects singular way disappearing night. Then he paused, hare still came on. Hares seem see little front; eyes sweep side, straight ahead blind till air brings scent dread. All hare sat up--he sniffed Bevis, minute flash rushed muzzle. Bevis ran directly found hare struggling; almost soon he lifted Pan there. Then Mark came leaping ant-hill ant-hill, crushing thistles his haste. As Mark come direct shore he knew general direction, hurried back raft, fearing savages might come see shooting mainland. Once island, perch cooking, game spread table--three moorhens, coot, dab-chick, wood-pigeon, hare, jack Mark caught. Of hare, rather leveret, young one, finest. His black-tipped ears, his clean pads, his fur--every separate hair three shades colour--it pleasure smooth his fur hand. "This jolliest day we have had," said Mark. "All shooting killing real hunting--real island--and work cooking, except like. It is splendid." "If Val Cecil could see," said Bevis, handling ears his hare twentieth time. "Will not go tell them?" "Do not talk that," said Mark; "do not say anything going home; that is Other Side, know." "So is. No, will not say anything it. Is not he beauty!" "A real beauty," said Mark. "Now let us see shoot lot to-morrow; it is turn; let shoot once?" "Of course; twice." "Hurrah! First let us get early see kangaroo out; let us go round Serendib; and, I say, let us go nearly Sweet River Falls--not quite, near enough savages--and, I say! must heaps things sedges tried walk once!" "We could pole across them." "Of course; get ambush mainland evening, shoot another parrot, fish--no, fishing slow, rather. Suppose make fish-spear stick them! stick mud eels. Could think make fish-spear, bone harpoon, iron one--sharp?" "I will try." "O! it; let us put wires, and--I declare, I forgot put trimmers; might put twenty trimmers nightlines--" "And build hut Serendib wait winter ducks come-- do not remember last winter--hundreds them?" "First-rate! But to-morrow. How stupid never brought nets!" "Well, stupid," said Bevis, still stroking his hare; he loved creature he slain. "I cannot think forgot nets." "There is thousands fish; could haul boatful. Let us see, is not anything else could do? Wish ferrets! It is right time, still does not matter." "Perhaps could build fence-net," said Bevis. "I forget proper name; it is stockade like V, drive animals dogs." "And pit strong spikes bottom corner. The perch ready; move things." Bevis hung hare cave, yet remained moment stroke unconscious creature. The perch good indeed; hurry fish cooked better. They played cards afterwards, discussing meantime various ways killing animals birds them. Already one day got enough serve three four, yet satisfied. Like savages, hurried thirst chase, like thirst wine; tongues parched dry sulphur fumes powder; hungered repeat wild excitement game struck hunted down. Had buffaloes prairie, would same; great elephants inner Africa, would shot without even thought ivory. As fastening Pan doorway lying recollected visit unknown creature previous night, went padlocked gate. The matchlock loaded shot, require accurate aim, therefore best shooting hurry, instead hung leaned wall accessible, priming seen to. A long candle put lantern niche left burning, awakened could see get gun once. The creature went quickly moment must lost shooting came again, said (to set clock minds) would stop listen, jump second awoke Pan barked. This time thought sure see animal least, shoot it. Volume Three, Chapter X. NEW FORMOSA--THE TIGER FROM THE REEDS. Pan bark. It seemed scarcely closed eyes; reality slept hours; candle burned short. The clock minds set, bed instant. Bevis, his eyes hardly open, lighting match gun; Mark darted curtain door. There thick mist he could see nothing: second he snatched his pocket-knife (for slept clothes), cut cord Pan fastened Bevis came gun. Pan raced aperture fence corner cliff--he perfectly howled frantic rage he ran crushed through. They open she would outside hut, heard Pan scamper without; suddenly his howl rage stopped, second silence, dog yelled pain. The next moment he crept back fence he something hurled stockade behind force fence shook. "Shoot--shoot there," shouted Mark, dog crept whining towards them. Bevis lifted gun, paused. "If thing jumps fence," he said. He one shot, he could load quickly: Mark understood. "No--no, do not shoot. Here--here is bow." Bevis took sent arrow fence corner force penetrated willow-work feather. Then ran gate looked over. All scarcely occupied minute. But nothing see. The thick white mist concealed everything edge brambles near stockade, tops trees farther away. "Nothing," said Mark. "What it?" "Shall go out?" said Bevis. "No--not till seen it." "It would better not--we cannot tell." "You shoot jumps fence," said Mark, "if comes: stop minute top." Unless clear fence, animals pause moment top leap down. They went back open she would feeling would best way inside fence, view creature sprang. Mark picked axe, he weapon second arrow he his hand: axe effective weapon gun. They stood she would, watching top stockade waiting. Till looked upon unknown stealthy thief only, Pan recoiled knew must something more. "It might jump cliff," said Bevis. While watched semi-circular fence front creature might steal round cliff leap roof hut. Mark stepped looked along verge sand cliff. He could see runners brambles hung edge, nothing there. Looking like he could see pale stars mist. It deep mist--it like layer ground, impenetrable eye longitudinally, partially transparent vertically. Returning inside, Mark stooped examined Pan, crept heels. There scratches him. "He is hurt," said Mark. "No teeth claws." "But he pat, did not he?" "I thought so--how he yelled! But look, there is blood. Perhaps thing hit without putting claws out." "They slip strike," said Bevis, meaning wild beasts strike claws involuntarily extend sheaths. He looked, Pan hurt; Mark felt his ribs too, said none broken. There fragments fur hair his mouth, remnants struggle. "I do not believe he fought all," said Bevis. "He stopped--he never went near." "Very likely: I remember--he stopped barking once; he afraid!" "That it: he yelled--" "It must fright," said Mark. "Nothing touched him: Pan, it?" Pan wagged his tail once, only: he still crouched kept close them. Though patted reassured, his spirit much broken recover rapidly. The spaniel thoroughly cowed. "It came near," said Bevis. "It hit fence he getting through." "It must missed him--perhaps long jump. Did hear anything rush off." "No." "No I." "Soft pads," said Bevis, "they make noise like hoofs." "No, it: it is sandy too." Sand "gives" little deadens sound footsteps. "Let us go look again." "So will." They went gate--Pan, noticed follow--and looked again: time longer searchingly. They could see ground yards, mist obscured like fleece among brambles. "Pan's afraid come," said Mark, went back she would. "The fire ought lit," said Bevis. "They afraid fire." "You watch," said Mark, "and I will light it." He drew his boots, put his coat--for ran waistcoat trousers--then he held gun, Bevis same; Bevis took it, Mark hastily gathered sticks together lit them, often glancing his shoulder fence behind, axe always ready his hand. When flames began rise felt ease; knew wild beasts dislike fire, somehow fire warms spirit well body. The morning warm enough, need fire, sight twisted tongues curled spirally broke away restorative heat actual bodily chill. Bevis went near: even spaniel felt it, he shook seemed cheerful. "The thing near first went out," said Bevis. "I wish run gate directly without waiting gun." "But know was." "No." "And I cut Pan loose directly." "It run ten yards sight mist." "And seems dark first run out." "It is lighter now." "There is dew." "Dry mist--it is clearing little." As stood fire verge cliff roof hut came clear vapour, saw trees outside stockade rise higher vapour shrunk them: stars faint. "Lu--lu!" said Mark, pointing crevice fence cliff, urging Pan go again: spaniel went yards towards it, turned came back. He could induced venture alone. "Lions _do_ get loose sometimes," said Bevis thoughtfully. He running every wild beast his mind could possibility approach them. Cases occur every vans overturned, lions tigers escaping. "So do, heard roar." "No, must come stops island," said Bevis. "We round many times. Or go fro--do lions swim?" "He would need to," said Mark. "I mean he swum here, he would not go away us--he could lie bushes." "Perhaps gone close without knowing," said Bevis. "There is `wait-a-bit thorns.'" They never thicket blackthorn. "Pan never barked though. He is round island us." "Perhaps he afraid--like he now." "Ah, yes, likely." "And hit keep quiet, startle kangaroos." "Or water-fowl--so did: may gone close without knowing." "In `wait-a-bits' hazel." "Or sedges, it is drier." "Foxes lie withy beds--why this?" "Of course: I say--only think, may gone within reach paw ten times." "While lying too," said Bevis, "in ambush It might ferns close behind." "All times walked never took gun," said Mark; "or bow arrow, axe, anything--and think! Why came back raft without even stick hands." "Yes--it silly: came quietly too, try see it." "Well, stupid!" said Mark. "Only never thought It could anything big." "But It must be." "Of course It is: will not go without gun, axe--" "And bow shoot again, cannot load matchlock quick." "That is worst it: tigers get loose sometimes, do not they? panthers often, them." "Yes, one dangerous other. Panthers worse lions." "More creepy." "Cattish. They slink you; do not roar first." "Then perhaps it is panther." "Perhaps. This likely place, anything got loose; there is jungle mainland, woods, Chase Jack's." "Yes--plenty cover: almost like forest." Besides great wood wandered several others neighbourhood, Chase hills Jack's, case beast escaping caravan would find extensive cover hide in. "Only think," said Bevis, "when bathed!" "Ah!" Mark shuddered. While bathed naked unarmed, darted reeds would fallen instant victims, without possibility struggle even. "It _is_ horrible," said Bevis. "There reeds sedges everywhere," said Mark. "It may anywhere." "It is safe move." "Especially Pan's afraid will not warn us. _If_ thing seen us bathing; It could not, else--ah!" "They tear so," said Bevis. "It is wound much tearing." "Like bramble hooks," said Mark. The curved hooks brambles briars inflict lacerated hurts worse spikes thorns. Flesh torn cannot heal like incised. "O! stop! panthers get trees, do not they? It may oak day!" "In ivy: looked!" "But ivy thick might seen! It might jumped us." "So might minute wood." "Then cannot go wood." "Nor among sedges round shore." "Nor brambles, fern, hazel." "Nowhere--except raft." "Then must take care come back." "How shall sleep!" "Ah!--think, might come night!" "We left gate open." "O! stupid been." "It could kill Pan one stroke." "And Pan here: he used swim off." "Directly he tied up, recollect, first night, he barked--no, second." "It may come _every_ night before." "Right inside stockade--under awning." "Into hut away--the bacon shelf." "If It could jump like that, could jump fence." "Of course; shows cat-like creature, could take one thing without disturbing another. Dogs knock things down, cats do not." "No, panthers sort big cat." "That is gnawed jack's head." "And mark ground--their pads soft, do not cut holes like hoofs." "The kangaroos too, remember: often would not come out. Something about." "Of course. How could stupid see before!" "Why, never suspected." "But ought suspected. You thought saw something move sedges Sunday." "So I did--it thing: must been." "Then swims comes back." "Then hunt island do not find It--we are safer, may come us time." "Any time." "What _shall_ do?" "Cannot go home," said Bevis. "Cannot go home," repeated Mark. They could desert island: would like running away too, often talked Africa shooting big game. Then run away presence would lowered estimation. "Cannot," said Bevis again. "Cannot," repeated Mark. They _could_ go--they must face It, whatever was. "We shall look every step," said Bevis. "Up trees--through bushes--and reeds." "We must go reeds much: cannot tell there--" "No, much. We must watch night. First one, other." "And keep fire burning. There ought fence along top cliff." "Yes--that is awkward: cannot put stakes hard sand like that." "We must drive some--and cut sharp top." "What pity stockade sharp top!--Nails, that is it: must drive long nails file tops off!" "And put stakes nails along cliff--the thing could get quite quick." "The gate strong: must barricade it." "Wish could lock door!" "I think so!" Now realised forgotten routine civilised life-- security doors bolts. Their curtain defence. "Barricade door." "Yes, close, else cannot shoot--we trapped." "I see! Put barricade round little way front. Why two fires, one side!" "Capital. We fortify place! Loop-holes. The weak spot edge cliff there. If put fire people may see it--savages--and find us." "That will not do." "No: must fortify edge somehow, stakes nails one thing. Perhaps train gunpowder!" "Ah, yes. Lucky we have got plenty eat. It will not nice gun loaded. I mean loading thing might come." "We have got plenty eat." "And I wanted lot shooting to-day," said Mark. "All that is spoiled." "Quite spoiled." Yesterday become intoxicated savage joy killing, savage's cruel wild abandoned unutterable joy: planned slaughter to-day. To-day environed deadly peril. This opposite side wild life: forest takes revenge filling mind ceaseless anxiety. "The sun!" said Bevis pleasure rays fell aslant open she would. The sun horizon little concealed clouds thick vapour. Now full bright light day come seemed need intense watchfulness. It hardly likely would attacked stockade broad daylight; boldest beasts prey would unless driven hard hunger. But began prepare breakfast, water fill kettle: Mark generally went shore water every morning. Although formal arrangement, practice gradually come one one thing one another: Mark got water, Bevis cut wood fire. Mark usually gone zinc bucket, whistling strand merry enough. Now he took bucket, hesitated. "I will come," said Bevis. "One cannot go alone anywhere now." "The must always matchlock ready." "Always," said Bevis, "and keep sharp lookout round one things. Why gun loaded shot, I remember!" "No is: lucky It jump over! Shot would use." "I will shoot off," said Bevis--"our ramrod will not draw charge--and load again." "Yes, do." Bevis fired charge air, heard pellets presently falling like hail among trees outside. Then he loaded ball, blew match, looked priming; Mark took axe one hand bucket other, unlocked gate. "We ought able lock behind us," he said. "We will put another staple presently," said Bevis. "Step carefully see marks ground." They examined surface attentively, could distinguish footprints: went fence creature sprung it. The arrow projected, near it, close investigation, saw piece bark interwoven willow torn claw. But look intently would could trace ground, thin grass sand would take imprint. "Pads," said Bevis, "else would spoor." "Tiger, panther then: must take care," said Mark. "Pan's right now, look." Pan trotted along well-known path shore, swinging his tail unconcerned. As walked kept watch every direction, trees, behind bushes, surface hollow, avoided fern. When Mark dipped, returned manner, walking slowly constantly alert. Volume Three, Chapter XI. NEW FORMOSA--THE FORTIFICATION. Entering stockade, locked gate behind them, thing never done daylight, might surprised. After breakfast Bevis began file heads nails, slow work, he done five six, he thought would handier drive posts first, file afterwards, could work instead one. They one vice hold nail one could use time. So nails, longest largest had, driven stakes stockade foot apart--as near stakes stood other--and thus, without much weariness wrist, filing tedious, cut heads sharpened them. Had spikes nearer together would better, could manage; willow-work split large nail driven it. Next got together materials barricading door hut, rather open she would front it. To cut go outside, Mark watched matchlock Bevis chopped. Poles nailed across open sides upright upright, six inches asunder right beam two sides. This allowed plenty space shoot through, nothing size could spring in. On third, poles nailed across three feet high, rest prepared left ready lashed position cords last thing night. When put would complete cage within could fire shoot arrows, safe spring beast. Lastly, went cliff see could done there. The sand hard, drive stakes whole length cliff edge would taken day, two days. They decided put hut prevent creature leaping roof, perhaps tearing way it. Bevis held matchlock time watched Mark hewed stakes, taking labour watching turn. With much trouble, driven home sharpened nails put top, beast approaching behind would leap descending perpendicular cliff hut. The fortification complete, sat think anything else. "One thing," said Mark, "we take care fill kettle bucket water evening go sleep. Suppose thing came stopped outside would not go away?" "Besieged us--yes, would awkward; fill pots things water, get plenty wood fires. How uncomfortable without bath!" "I feel horrid." "I _must_ bath," said Bevis. "I _will_ swim." "We watch turn, panther sees one stripped it is likely try seize him." "Yes, that is true: I know! Suppose go raft!" "Right away." "Out Pearl Island swim there: sedges there." "Hurrah! If he comes see long way first." "Of course, keep gun ready." "Come on." "First drive staple lock gate outside." This done, went raft, moving cautiously examining every likely place beast lie ambush passing. The raft poled round Pearl Island, sedges grew, within seventy eighty yards. Nothing could approach without seen. Yet, stood brim ready go water sense defencelessness almost overpowering. The gun hand, match burning, axe could snatched moment, bow strung sharp arrows it. But without clothes felt defenceless. The human skin offers resistance thorn claw tusk. There nothing us enemy, armour hide, his tusk go straight lives once. Standing brink felt heat sun skin: could bear even sunbeams, could sensitive delicate covering endure tiger's claw? "It will not do," said Mark. "No." "Suppose watch I swim, swim I watch?" "That better." Bevis stopped board raft, threw his coat loosely round his shoulders,--for sun, he kept still, would otherwise redden blister, skin peel,--and took matchlock. So soon Mark saw he gun ready, he ran in, shallow plunge, swam round raft keeping close it. When he his bath, he threw towel round his shoulders protect heat Bevis his coat took gun. Bevis his swim, dressed. Poling raft back island, observed precautions going trees hut. Once Mark fancied something fern, Pan innocently ran could call him, nothing moved went spot, found two fronds turned yellow looked distance little like tawny coat animal. Except excitement state terrorism would recognised yellow fern instant; intent one subject mind ready construe everything relating it, disallows plain evidence senses. Even "seeing" hardly "believing." They reached hut without anything happening, could wander island careless way hitherto done, nothing else do, cooked two moorhens. The gate stockade locked, gun kept constantly hand. A good deal match consumed, always burning, else could shoot quickly. Soon sense confinement became irksome: could go outside without arming teeth, walk circumscribed space monotonous, indeed could freedom. "Cannot move," said Mark. "Chained like dogs." "I hate it." "Hate it! I think so!" "But cannot go out." "No." They endure it: could even go see time dial without one accompanying gun guard. It late finished dinner, went watch signal. On cliff felt secure, nothing could approach front, behind slope partly open, still one always keep watch even there. Mark sat facing slope gun: Bevis faced New Sea telescope. The sky clouded wind, puffs, south-east. Charlie soon came, waved handkerchief, went away. "I wish he here," said Bevis. "So I now," said Mark, "and Val Cecil--" "And Ted." "Yes. But could know panther here?" "But serves us right asking them," said Bevis. "It selfish us." "Suppose go ashore send Loo tell Charlie Val--" "Last night," said Bevis, interrupting, "why--while I wilderness thicket thing might either us." "No one watching." "If one attacked, one near help." "No." "But could go together, tell Loo, get Charlie Val Cecil Ted. If guns now!" "Five six us!" "Perhaps told people home, governor would let one his: could load shoot quick!" "And Jolly Old Moke would let his! Val could get another Ted, could hunt island shoot creature." Mark eager company he one enjoy island them. "We could bring raft," said Bevis. "It would carry four, I think." "Twice would then. Let us tell them! Let us see Loo, send her! Would not come quick lightning!" "They would wild help shoot it." "Just chance." "Yes; I say! stupes be!" said Bevis. "Why? How?" "After danger trouble, let come shooting hunt skin." "Triumph spoils!" "Striped skin." "Or spotted." "Or tawny mane--we do not know which. Just think, let it!" "No," said Mark. "That will not: must it." "It is _our_ tiger," said Bevis. "All ours." "Every bit." "The claws make things, do not they?" said Mark: he meant reverse, things made tiger's claws trophies. "Yes, teeth." "And skin--beautiful!" "Splendid!" "Rugs." "Hurrah!" "We will him!" "Kill him!" "Yow--wow!" Pan caught altered mood leaped them, barking joyously. They went stockade considered anything could add defences, time increase chances shooting tiger. "Perhaps he will not spring over," said Mark; "suppose leave gate open? else shall not get shot him." "I want shot he is fence," said Bevis, "balanced top, know, like Pan sometimes home." In leaping fence gate high often laughed spaniel swaying edge able get his balance leap without falling headlong. "I know do," he continued, "we will put meat tempt him." "Bait." "Hang birds--and hare--no--shall I? He is beauty. Yes, I will. I will put hare too. Hares game; he is sure jump hare." "Drive stake half-way," said Mark, meaning half-way cage stockade. "Let us now." There several pieces poles lying about, stake soon up. The birds hare strung tempt beast leap enclosure. The next point part aim? At head, shoulders, where? fatal. The head best, hurry excitement might miss it, he might turn his shoulder, decided whoever watch moment aim body creature certain plant bullet it. If he hit, his rage desire revenge would prevent going away; he would attack cage, he venting his rage bars would time load fire again. "And put muzzle close his head second time," said Mark. "Certain kill then." They sat inside cage imagined position beast would approached them. Mark load matchlock second shot case, Bevis sent arrow arrow creature. Pan tied short cord, else perhaps tiger panther would insert paw kill single pat. "But it is long wait," said Mark. "He will not come till middle night." "He is day out," said Bevis. "Suppose go cliff, leave gate open, he comes shoot him?" "Come on." They went cliff, behind spiked stakes, taking gun, axe, bow arrows. If beast entered enclosure could get capital shot him, could he leap up, he would go distance round get them, meantime gun could reloaded. They waited, nothing entered stockade robin. "This slow," said Mark. "Very," said Bevis. "What is use waiting? Suppose go hunt up." "In wood?" "Everywhere--sedges fern--everywhere." "Hurrah!" Up jumped full delight thought freedom again. It great relief move ignored danger. Anything better forced stay still. "If he is island we will find him." "Leave gate open, may run quick." "Perhaps he will go we are away, slip cliff, fire down--" "Jolly!" "Look sharp." "Blow match." They entered among trees, following path led round island. Bevis carried matchlock, Mark bow arrows axe, arranged moment Bevis fired he pass gun Mark, take his bow. While he shot arrows, Mark load shoot quick he could. The axe thrown ground, either could snatch necessary. All regretted got proper hunting-knives. First went raft moored alder bough usual, projecting point Mark fished; willow-tree lay overthrown water, firs reclined. Then went shore uttermost southern extremity sent Pan sedges. He drove moorhen, shoot now, daring lest beast attack could load again. Coming western side island, thought saw something bushes, found trunk fallen tree. In going inland Kangaroo Hill moved slowly wood thicker, intent slightest indication, sudden motion squirrel climbing beech startled them. From top green knoll looked round, thus examined glade. There slightest sign. The feathers wood-pigeon scattered grass one place, hawk struck down. This happened since last glade. It probably one pigeons roosted ivy-grown oak. Crossing oak, flung sticks ivy; roar response. While remembered wires, looked them, nothing caught, considered proof rabbits afraid venture far burries tiger, whatever beast was, prowling night. Returning shore, recollected large bed sedges reed-grass little way back, going Bevis shot arrow it. The arrow slipped reed-grass slight rustle till lost. The spaniel ran heard plunging about. There nothing reed-grass. Lastly went thicket "wait-a-bit" blackthorn. Pan go in, much, he soon came out, he like blackthorn. But throwing stones fragments dead branches air descend midst thicket satisfied nothing it. It necessary cast stones sticks air would penetrate thrown horizontally. The circuit island completed, crept quietly verge cliff behind spiked stakes. The stockade exactly left it; Pan looked edge cliff it, even sniff. They went rested minutes. There never greater temerity searching island tiger. Neither bullet arrows would stayed advance terrible beast moment. Inside stockade cage might withstand him; open he would swept lady's sleeve might sweep chessmen board. Thus his native haunts he overthrows crowd spear-armed savages. "He cannot island," said Mark. "It is curious see sign," said Bevis. "There marks footprints anywhere." "If clay now--wet clay," said Mark, "but it is sandy; his claws would show clay like Pan's." "Like crab." Pan's footprint moist clay somewhat crab-shaped. "Is place he would leave mark?" "Just edge water moorhens leave footprints." "That would place, cannot look close edge everywhere." "There is raft; could raft." "Shall go raft?" "Suppose go round island?" said Bevis, "on raft." "We never been," said Mark. "Not close shore." "No; let us pole round close shore--all round, see find spoor shallows." They went raft embarked. As started crimson glow shot along clouds, sun sinking sky beamed. The wind risen wavelets came splash, splash edge raft. Some yellow leaves willows floated along fell deck. They poled slowly constantly grounded struck shore, occupied time get round, especially southern extremity shallow obliged go long way out. In hour reached thick bed reed-grass Bevis shot his arrow, raft slowly glided Mark suddenly exclaimed, "There is!" There was--a path reed-grass water's edge-- trail creature. Bevis stuck his pole ground check onward movement raft. The impetus heavy vessel great though moving slowly required his strength stay it. Mark came his pole, together pushed raft back, ran right reed-grass grounded. Pan instantly leapt path, ran along wagging his tail; he scent, though seemed faint he give tongue. They stood bulwark raft looked trail. Volume Three, Chapter XII. NEW FORMOSA--THE TRAIL. At water's edge flags bent, tall grass, high chests, thrust aside, forming path evidently frequently trodden. There longer least doubt creature, whatever was, large size, trail distinct thought occurred perhaps used one. From raft could see along five six yards, turned avoid alder. While stood looking Pan came back, he run right returned, nothing reed-bed present. Bevis stepped bulwark trail matchlock; Mark picked axe followed. As walked elbows touched grass side, showed creature rather high broad, lean like whole feline tribe, long, lean, stealthy. The reed-grass flowered would soon begin stiffen rustle dry winds. By alder bryony vine grown broken withered, snapped long since creature pushing through. The trail turned right, left round willow stole, Pan, trotted Bevis, picked bone. He picked dropped it; he took habit, though he knew sapless use him. Bevis took his mouth, knew duck's drumstick. It polished smooth, creature licked it, probable carried distance, left useless. They doubt drumstick wild duck Mark shot. The trail went straight sedges next, trampled flat; sedges grew wider apart gradually lost thin, short grass. This seen land, path began degrees; water's edge, grasses thick high, seen once. Try would, could follow trail inland, thought knew read "sign," found fault. On dry, hard ground creature's pads left trail could trace. Mark cut stick axe stuck ground could find spot path faded walking shore, returned raft. On way caught sight Bevis's arrow sticking trunk alder, withdrew it. At water's edge looked see spoor. In passing reed-grass creature trampled down, walked carpet vegetation prevented footprints left ground though moist there. At water's edge perhaps might found some, pushing raft beams rubbed mud obliterated everything. When got raft looked bulwark, yards shore noticed surface weeds growing appeared disturbed. The raft moved out, found weeds trampled; water shallow, creature approaching shore probably plunged spaniel shallow water. Like reed-grass trampled weeds prevented footprints ooze. They traced course creature come fully thirty yards, track pointed straight shore mainland seemed started great distance used land. But thrust raft far this, without great difficulty, dragged heavily weeds sometimes ground, marks changed trended southwards. The water little deeper signs became less less obvious, still were, pointed directly south. They lost edge weeds, water still shallow, character bottom changed ooze hard rock-like sand. Here met waves driven southerly wind, coming part New Sea yet explored. The wind strong enough make hard work pole raft it, spray dashed willow bulwark. These waves prevented clearly distinguishing bottom, though water shallow, thought calm creature's pads would left marks hard sand. It hour sunset, louring clouds rendered dusky usual soon. The creature evidently come jungle southwards, possible go night face rising gale. The search must suspended till morning. Letting raft drive wind, assisting progress poling, managed get sheer force weeds clear deep water cliff, paddled round, unable touch bottom, waves drifted Serendib. With continual labour poled along shore Serendib, nearly end island, half-way across, paddling hard poles contrived get aslant. By time moored it, quite dusk, tired exertion forcing unwieldy craft face gale. Hastening home found stockade left, lost moment lighting fires, one side hut, wood already collected. The gate padlocked, kettle put on, sat rest. A good supper strong tea restored strength. They sat inside cage table, needed lantern, light two fires lit interior stockade. As became later hare birds fastened stake bait, wood heaped fires, last remaining poles lashed uprights she would, forming complete cage horizontal bars. The matchlock placed handy, bow arrows laid ready, axes, beast inserted his paw could strike it. Cards drawn see go sleep first, Bevis cut highest, he went hut lie down. But he quarter hour he jumped up, quite unable go sleep. Mark said he feel least sleepy either, agreed sit up. Till outer she would cage, Mark thought perhaps creature would come saw them, went inside hut, made Pan come too. The curtain partly let looped aside, view stockade, lantern lit set niche. They could hear wind rushing trees outside, every puff entered made lantern flicker. The fires still burned brightly, nothing came time passed slowly. Bevis care write his journal, last fell back cards played bezique bed. After time wearied. The tea supper refreshed them; worked hard day--a long day too, early--and interest began flag. The cards put stood recover wakefulness, went cage. The fires still flickered, though piles wood burnt through, sticks fallen off, half one side half other. The wind risen howled along, carrying leaves blew bars. It perfectly dark, thick clouds hid moon, drops rain borne gale. They would liked replenish fires, could get without unlashing several bars, Mark said creature would likely come fires burned low. Weary yawning went back hut sat more. "One thing," said Mark, "suppose he stay outside stockade--I mean he comes shoot hit till he savage, do not kill him, well he cannot get us, do not see, day he will go outside stockade lie down." "So cannot go out." "And he will stay, wait, wait." "And stay till starved." "We could shoot stockade." "No. Or he could go cliff watch never let us out. Our provisions would last ever." "The water would go first." "Suppose he that, shall then?" said Mark. "I do not know," said Bevis languidly. "But, think." "Bore tunnel cliff sea," said Bevis, yawning. "I sleepy, one get swim round fetch raft." "Tunnel cave right through?" "Straight right through." "We shall beat way," said Mark. "Of course shall. Wish he would come! O!"--yawning--"Let us go sleep; Pan bark." "Not both," said Mark. "Both." "No." Mark would agree this. In end cut cards Mark won. He stretched bed asked Bevis he going do. Bevis took one great-coats (his pillow), placed floor wall hut, sat leaned back wall. In position, curtain looped up, he could see straight across gateway stockade, visible whenever embers fires sent flash light. Pan close curled comfortably. He put matchlock his side he could snatch moment. "Good-night," he said; Mark already firm asleep. Bevis put his hand stroked Pan; spaniel recognised touch his sleep, never moved. Now still, talking, Bevis could hear sound wind much plainer, cry heron rising harsh roar. Sometimes interior stockade seemed calm, wind blew tops trees top cliff, left hollow perfect stillness. Suddenly, like genie, wind descended, flames leapt side embers. In moment flames fell enclosure without darkness. All still except distant roar wood. A fly kept awake lantern crawled along roof, became entangled spider's web buzzed. The buzz seemed quite loud silent hut. Pan sighed his slumber. Bevis stretched his legs fell asleep, gnat alighted his face tickled him. He awoke, shook himself, reproached neglecting his duty. The match matchlock burned almost away; he drew last two inches farther spiral hammer, thought he would get minute put match in. Ten seconds later he asleep; time firmly. The last two inches match smouldered away, leaving gun useless till another lit inserted. Down came genie wind, whirling grey ashes fires waking feebler response. The candle lantern guttered went out. As dawn drew clouds became visible, travelling north-north-west, wind veered night. A grey light came hut. The strong gusts gale ceased, instead light steady breeze blew. The clouds broke sky showed. A crow came perched stockade, flew picked several fragments; crow pecked jack's head. He meditated attack hare birds strung stake, Pan woke, yawned stretched himself. Instantly crow flew off. Sunbeams fell aslant horizontal bars table. Pan got went far short cord allowed him; crust table; he disdained last night supper, meat had, he ate it. He gave kind yawning whine, much say, "Do wake up;" sleeping far sound hear him. Mark woke first, sat up. Bevis slept long time his back wall, afterwards gently sunk down, lying his head bare ground floor. Mark laughed. Pan wagged his tail looked Bevis he understood it. Mark touched Bevis, he instantly sat up, felt gun dark. "Why!" "It is morning." "He has not been?" "No." They unlashed bars, let Pan loose, went courtyard. It beautiful fresh morning. There signs whatever creature visited place, neither outside in. They much disappointed come, supposed wind roughness waves deterred venturing across. After breakfast, looking sun-dial, surprised find ten of the clock. Then taking matchlock, bow, axe, before, started bed reed-grass, thinking creature might possibly come island without approaching stockade. The danger grown familiar, care least; walked straight place without delay reconnoitring. The trail apparently used night, small branch ash snapped blown it, waves wind smoothed away disturbed appearance weeds. As wind favourable rough, resolved sail south examine shore there, could hit upon trail follow up. But first must bath Pearl Island. They returned hut, put hare birds hung stake inside hut, lashed bars, determined creature events game absence. Then locking gate stockade, went raft, bathed Pearl Island. The mast stepped, stays fastened, sail set. Bevis took rudder put water starboard quarter, like long, broad oar, sail filled, heavy craft began drive wind. Mark knelt front keep sharp look-out shoals knew existed. As Calypso drew little water passed several without touching, Pinta, deep ballast, struck, soon past farthest point reached boat. Volume Three, Chapter XIII. NEW FORMOSA--VOYAGE IN THE CALYPSO. Surging along Calypso sought south, travelling little faster waves, smoothing broad wake she drove them. Bevis held oar-rudder his right arm, his hand handle, felt vibration million bubbles rising edge rudder surface. Piloting vessel Mark sometimes directed steer right, sometimes left. There four herons standing row one sand-bank, rose made approach; Bevis said he must heron's plume. They could see swan long, long way behind broad open water Fir-Tree Gulf. Not long passing heron's sand-bank, Mark said he sure water deeper, fewer weeds, long island front would soon bar progress. It stretched one mass impenetrable weeds another, began think lowering sail, suddenly raft stopped jerk, swung round, hung suspended. "A snag," said Bevis, recovering himself. Mark pitched forward, willow-plaited bulwark would gone overboard. They sail moment, fearing mast would snap. As moved deck raft swung way like platform pivot. "If Pinta," said Mark, "there would hole knocked bottom." The thin planking boat would crushed like egg-she will; thick beams bottom Calypso could damaged. The difficulty get her off. They tried standing one edge, other, depressing stood lightening part, last moving everything heavy deck one corner, she floated bumped off. Looking bulwark saw snag, top dead submerged willow. Had large sail, wind rough mast would snapped certainty; wind gradually sinking hours. They hoist sail again, near long willow-grown island, let raft drift shore. The willows thick appear use carry matchlock long barrel would constantly catch boughs. Bevis took his bow arrows, Mark his axe, climbed ashore blue gums, compelling Pan threats keep close behind. The island soon found nothing narrow bank, beyond water recommenced, even could dragged raft launched afresh part beyond would navigable. It plated pond-weed, brown leaves overlapping like scale-armour surface. There seemed indeed weed water, great water-docks margin leaves almost yard long, branched water plantains palm-like leaves pale pink flowers; flags already little brown, sedges huge tussocks; last--small islets tall grass-- close together shallow water like ant-hills Waste. No course could forced twisted mass, beyond beds reed-grass, rose reddish scaling poles willow. At distant margin could see tops trees jungle mainland. Where water visible red tinge look good drink, different New Formosa. This stagnant. The current, slight was, Sweet River Falls, passed New Formosa Serendib, hence deep channel, rendered water always fresh pure. Over pond-weed blue dragon-flies hovering, among willows tits called other. "It is South America," said Mark. "It is swamp Amazon." "I suppose is," said Bevis. "We cannot go farther." Without wading-boots impossible penetrate swamp, even could gone among black-jointed horse-tails, stems turning yellowish, would sunk ooze waist. It would haunt bearded-tit curiously marked bird extinct shores New Sea. They never even heard bearded-tit, completely died there. They moved yards along bank, found ceaseless climb stole stole, went back raft, poled close shore looking traces creature. They poled one end other, banks weeds flags, without seeing sign. So far could tell creature started place, might swum part shore. "He is here," said Bevis. "We shall never hunt sedges; I think better set trap him." "In reeds home,"--New Formosa home now. "In his trail." "Dig pit," said Mark. "They dig pits lions." "Or set big beam fall crush he pushes twig." "Or spring gun; would matchlock do?" "Only want another gun go find him. He might sham dead." "Wires strong enough." "No; pit's best," said Bevis. "Yes; we will dig pit stick sharp spike it, put trap-door top--just slight frame, know, give way his weight--" "And strew grass." "And put hare tempt him." "And shoot pit!" "Will not he glare!" "Roar!" "Gnash his grinders!" "Will not his teeth gleam!" "Red tongue foam!" "Hot breath--in rage!" "Lash his tail!" "Tear sides pit!" "Do not let us kill quick. Let us make spear stick little!" "Come on." They seized poles, eagerness return dig pit. "Stupes before." "Awful stupes." "We never think things till long." Such case world since history began. How many thousands years primeval man first boiled water steam-engine? How long first rubbing electron amber, leaping little particles it, electric tramway? They sailed swamp quickly, occupied hour pole back New Formosa, afternoon moored Calypso usual place. They hungry hastened hut, intending begin pit directly dinner, came near, Pan ran first barked gate. "Ah!" "He is been!" They ran, forgetting even look match gun. There nothing enclosure; Pan sniffed outside, gave two short "yaps" much say, "I know." "Reeds," said Bevis. "He is reeds." "He heard us coming slipped off--he is hiding." "We shall him! Now!" "Now directly!" "This minute!" With incredible temerity ran fast could go bed reed-grass discovered trail. Pan barked edge; Bevis blew match. "Lu--lu--lu! go in!" "Fetch out." "Hess--ess--go in!" "Now! Have him!" Pan stopped edge yapped air, wagging his tail hesitating. "He is there!" said Bevis. "As sure sure," said Mark. Their faces lit wild joy combat; like hounds could scent quarry. "Go in," shouted Bevis spaniel angrily. Pan crouched, would go. Mark kicked him, he would move. "Hold it," said Bevis, handing matchlock Mark. He seized spaniel his shaggy neck, lifted hurled main force yards crash among sedges. Pan came instant. "Go in, I tell you!" shouted Bevis, beside anger; spaniel shivered his feet. Again Bevis lifted him, swung him, hurled far time reed-grass. The next instant Pan his feet again. Encouragement, persuasion, threats, blows, failed; like trying make climb tree. The dog could force his nature. Mark threw dead sticks reed-grass; Bevis flung stones. "You hateful wretch!" Bevis stamped his foot. "Get away." Pan ran back. "Give gun--I will go in." If dog would not, he would hunt creature lair himself. "O! stop!" said Mark, catching hold his arm, "do not--do not go in--you do not know!" "Let go." "I will not." "I go." They struggled other. "Shoot first," said Mark, finding he could hold him. "Shoot arrow--two arrows. Here--here is bow." Bevis seized bow fitted arrow. "Shoot path is," said Mark. "There--it is there,"--pointing. Bevis raised bow. "Now shoot!" "O!" cried voice reeds, "do not shoot!" Bevis instantly lowered bow. "What?" he said. "Who is there?" said Mark. "It is me--do not shoot me!" "Who you?" "Me." They rushed found Loo crouching behind alder reed-grass; her hand thick stick she dropped. "How dare you!" said Bevis. "How get here?" said Mark. "Do not angry!" said Loo. "But dare you!" "On island!" "Do not you--do not you!" repeated Loo. "You!" "You!" One word intense wrath. "O!" cried Loo, beginning sob. "You!" "You!" "O! Do not! He hungry." Sob, sob. "Pooh!" "Yah!" "Yow--wow!" barked Pan. "He--he," sobbed Loo. "He--he--" "He--what?" "He hungry." Sob, sob. "Who?" "Samson." "Who is Samson?" "My--y--lit--tle--brother." "Then took things?" said Mark. "He--he--kept crying." "You damper--" "And potatoes--" "And bacon--" "You did not--did not care it," sobbed Loo. "Did take rabbit-skin?" said Mark. "Yes--es." "But Samson did not eat that; he?" "I--I--sold it." "What for?" "Ha'-penny jumbles Samson." Jumbles sweets. "How get here?" "I come." "How?" "I come." "It is disgusting," said Bevis, turning Mark; "spoiling island." "Not tiger," said Mark. "Only girl." "It is proper," said Bevis towering rage. "Tigers proper, girls proper." "No; they are not." "Girls are--Foo!--" "Very--foo!" Contemptuous puffing. "It is stealing." "No; it is coming--" "Where you are wanted--" "Horrible!" "Hateful!" "What shall do?" "Cannot kill her." "Nor torture her." "Nor scalp her." "Thing!" "Creature!" "Yow--wow!" "Tie her up." "If savages we would cook you!" "Limb time." "What _can_ her?" "Let stop," said Loo pleadingly. "Let _you_ stop! You!" "I cook make tea wash things." "Stop minute," said Mark. "Perhaps she is native." "Ah!" This proper. "She looks brown." "Copper coloured." "Are savage?" "If says so," said Loo penitently. "Are sorry?" "You are sure you are savage?" "Will she do?" "You are slave." "Ar-right," [all-right], said Loo her brown eyes beginning sparkle her tears. "I will wants." "Mind you are slave." "So I be." "You will thrashed." "Do not care. Let I bide here." "I suppose must her." "You are great nuisance." "Ar-right." "Slave! Carry that." Mark gave her axe. "And that." Bevis gave her bow. Loo took proudly. "You are keep behind--Pan's go you." "Dogs first, slaves next." "Make her fetch water." "Chop wood." "Turn spit." "Capital; wanted slave!" "Just thing." "Hurrah!" "But it is nice tiger." "O! No!" "Nothing like." They marched reed-grass, Pan slave behind. "But get here?" said Bevis, stopping suddenly. "I come, I told you." "Can swim?" "No." "There is boat." "Did catamaran?" "What that?" "Why do not tell us got here?" "I come--a-foot." "Waded? You could not." "I walked drough't,"--i.e. it. They would believe her first, she adhered her story, offered wade back mainland prove possible. She pointed way she come shoals sedge-grown banks; course she taken curved like half horse-shoe. First went straight little way, route ford led south gradually turned back west, reaching mainland within sixty seventy yards place always disembarked raft. It took time Loo explain she done it, she came know it, like this. Once dry seasons waters receded much, lowered drawing hatches cattle might get water drink low valley, miles away. As waters New Sea receded shallower upper, southern end, became partly dry. Then broad low bank sand appeared stretching shape half horse-shoe extremity much higher never submerged, formed island New Formosa. At times one could walk mainland New Formosa dryshod weeks together. This island became stocked squirrels kangaroos; existence rabbits burries knoll originally led Loo's knowledge place. Her father went water low ferret them, she sent his luncheon fro. That time since, she never forgotten, often playing shore, difficulty finding shoal. The route ford was, moreover, marked one knew existence tops sand-banks, sedge-grown islets, fact nothing high parts long, curved bank. There foot deep water anywhere whole distance, often six inches. This August, winter would much more. Tucking her dress she waded easily, feeling bottom thick stick guide her steps. The worst place close island, reed-grass, she sunk little ooze, yards. At hut weapons laid aside, slave put dinner them. Bevis Mark sat, one side table, stools solid blocks, Pan sat beside Bevis his haunches expectant; slave knelt table. She bare-headed. Her black hair escaped, fell her waist, her neck tawny harvest sunshine. The torn brown frock loosely clung her. Her white teeth gleamed; her naked feet sandy like Pan's paws. Her brown eyes watched every movement; she intent them. They full plans island; she intent them. She ate ravenously, eagerly spaniel. Seeing this, Bevis kept cutting preserved tongue her, asked Samson hungry. Loo said hungry, Samson hungry. He cried almost day night, woke crying morning. Very often she left him, went long way hedge she like hear him. "But," objected Bevis, "my governor pays father money, I am sure mamma sends things." So she did, Loo said never got them; she twisted her mouth peculiarly intimate intercepted ale-barrel. Bevis became much agitated, he said he would tell governor, he would tell dear mamma, Samson cry more. Loo take home one tins preserved tongue, potatoes, game was--all except hare. Now Bevis always contact almost folk, yet he never seen; I live midst things, never look beneath surface. His face became quite white; he thoroughly upset. It his first glance hard roadside life. He said he would sorts things; Loo listened pleased dimly doubtful, she could explained herself, she, nevertheless, knew beyond Bevis's power alter circumstances. Not she hinted doubt; happiness enough kneel listen. Then made her tell many times she island, it, she proceeded recognised one one, little trifles previously meaning till connected formed continuous strand. In her rude language occupied long time, got cross-questioning one other. Put order like this. Volume Three, Chapter XIV. NEW FORMOSA--THE CAPTIVE. They arrived Wednesday; Wednesday night Pan stayed hut them, nothing happened. Thursday night, Pan swam mainland, he away Loo made her first visit island, coming right hut door curtain. Till she reached permanent plank table awning saw remnants supper carelessly left it, she thought taking anything. The desire share, ever secretly, alone led her there. So intense desire overcame her fear offending them; she must least see doing. From sedges she watched go island Pinta many times she certain place were. In wading island moonlight she caught glimpse sinking fire inside stockade, glow thrown cliff, easily found her way hut. Had Pan he would barked, he away; she came awning saw works-- stockade, hut, everything, increasing her eagerness. After she examined place wondered could build it, she saw remnants supper table, remembering Samson, took him. The rabbit's skin hung fence, she took also, knowing would fetch trifle; winter would worth more. She thought things nothing them, care them, threw aside like refuse. The second time she came Saturday morning, exploring Serendib. When Serendib she could cross New Formosa broad daylight unseen, New Formosa lay between, woods concealed one approaching western side. Her mother elder sisters reaping cornfields beyond Waste, she supposed minding younger children, instead she sedges watching New Formosa, directly she saw Bevis Mark pole raft across Serendib she waded over. She visited hut, took potatoes store cave, spent time wondering everything there. As she leaving landed raft, Pan sniffing her wood ran barking her. He knew her well made attempt bite, still he barked his duty tell one island. Thinking would run see was, she climbed ivy-grown oak, actually came underneath looked see her. They soon went away fancying must squirrel, Pan stopped till she descended, made friends followed her reed-grass, whence soon she thought safe she waded across mainland. Busy hut idea anything kind going on, could see water stockade. On Sunday morning she came again, third time, crossing Bamboo Island, satiating her curiosity indulging pleasure handling weapons things hut, she took cold half-cooked bacon shelf, two slices thrown Pan he left uneaten. When returned Pan knew she been; he barked first ran ivy-grown oak, finding she he went discovered her reed-grass. He satisfied discovered her, licked her hand. So soon everything quiet she slipped across mainland, afternoon, much interested eager see doing, she tried come again, Mark saw her head sedges. Loo crouched kept still long concluded one there. It afternoon looked oak marks claws, her naked feet left trace. She would probably attempted Monday night, evening came letter list provisions, seen spoken them, something them, her restless eagerness temporarily allayed. That night first Pan tied up, nothing disturbed him. But Tuesday night, flag-basket, inclination follow became strong, towards middle night, when, she supposed, Pan shore (for she seen swim nights), she approached hut. To her surprise Pan, tied up, began bark. Hastening away, her hurry she crossed spot Pan hid his treasures picked duck's drumstick, finding polished useless dropped among reed-grass. Wednesday night she ventured more, found gate stockade locked; she tried look over, Pan set his bark. She ran back yards bramble bushes crouched there, trusting thick mist hide her, fact did. In half minute, Mark cut cord, Pan rushed fury, he would fly her throat, coming near seeing was, he dropped his howl rage, silence supposed he engaged deadly struggle. Whether she really feared he would spring her, he came bounce, whether she thought Bevis Mark would follow find her, she hit Pan thick stick she carried. Now Pan touched, he swerved, big stick thump made ground frightened him, he yelped pain ran back. As he ran she threw stone him, stone hit fence shook it, knocked piece bark willow afterwards supposed torn claw tiger. Hearing talking dreading every moment would come out, she remained crouched brambles long time, last crept away, stayed reed-grass till sun shone, crossed mainland. Thursday she come, Thursday night, thinking best wait awhile let day night elapse. But Friday morning, seen sail south Calypso, exploring swamp, she waded over, looked wonderful hut curious cage constructed open she would. She lost admiring things trying imagine could for, returned near island she started go. She got far reed-grass saw come poling raft. On raft facing island could helped seeing her, she waited, intending cross entered stockade busy there. But Pan recognised she stockade; ran reed-grass, knew trail there, discovered her. The reason Pan would enter reeds, even hurled among them, his fear thick stick. "Stupes were!" said Bevis. "Most awful stupes!" "Not half Indians!" "Not quarter!" The whole thing clear could understand rightly read indications "sign" last appeared self-evident. But first wondered afterwards wise _before_ event. It easy read type set sentences printed proper sequence; difficult decipher defaced inscriptions unknown language. When path made one walk along express disdainful surprise ever difficulty. "But it is proper," said Bevis. "I wish tiger." "It would capital. But _we've_ got slave." "Where is she sleep to-night?" "Anywhere wood." "Slave, you are cook hare supper." "And mind do not make noise we are hunting frighten kangaroos." Loo said she would quiet mouse. "We shall want tea presently. I say!" said Mark, "we have forgotten Charlie!" He ran cliff, late; Charlie waved his cap three times, token quite right home. Mark looked sun-dial; nearly five. They dinner till later usual, Loo's explanation cross-examination filled time. Still Loo told she certain every one quite well home, trouble missed Charlie. Mark wished go shooting round Serendib, started, leaving slave charge hut cook supper. Mark matchlock, Bevis poled raft gently round Serendib, water-fowl seemed become cautious, see any. Bevis poled along till came little inlet, stopped, blue gum branches concealing either hand. Mark knelt he could see ways along shore; Bevis sat back willows Pan beside him. They quiet presently black-headed reed-bunting came looked willow bough. Moths fluttered among tops branches, wind light flew whither listed, instead borne water. The brown tips tall reeds moved slightly air came softly; bow bend; sway, yielding assent. Every rush overhead five six starlings passed swiftly, straight arrows, firs head Fir-Tree Gulf. These parties succeeding perhaps separate families gathering together tribe roosting-trees. Over distant firs thin cloud like black bar sky spread out, descended funnel-shaped firs. The cloud formed starlings, thousands them, rising trees settling again. One bird mere speck would invisible; legions darkened air like smoke. But beyond raft swallows glided, dipping breasts sipping dipped; touch friction water perceptibly checked flight. They wheeled round several times approached surface, till last exact balance exact angle skimmed water, leaving mark midge. Bevis watched them, he watched his senses gradually became acute, till he could distinctly hear faint far sound waterfall Sweet River. It rose fell, faint afar; flutter moth's wings greyish willow leaves overbore silenced it. As he listened watched swallows he thought, rather felt--for he think step step upwards conclusion--he felt power bird's wing tip. It slender-pointed elastic tip, flexible finely divided feather point bird flew. An artist cumbrous easel, heavy framework, solid palette distinct weight, he paints tiny point camel's hair. With camel's hair tip swallow sweeps sky. That part wing near body, thick, rigid, contains bones, easel framework; shaft driving force flows, floating forms part plane surface, influence air. The touch wing tip. There feathers fine extreme tenuity, held light comes filaments, seem feel air curl end flag mast curls itself. So tail fish--his one wing--curls extreme edge upper lower corners, unfolds presses back water. The swallow, pure artist flight, feels air his wing-tips fingers, lightly fanning glides. Over distant firs heron came drifting like cloud his accustomed hour; New Nile call partridge, "caer-wit--caer-wit," sounded along surface water. There slight movement Bevis saw match descending, inverted cone smoke darted priming, almost report Pan leaped overboard. Mark watched till two moorhens near enough together, one he shot outright Pan caught other. At report heron staggered air bullet struck him, his sudden effort check his course, recovering he wheeled flew towards woods mainland. Bevis said he must heron's plume. To please Mark he poled raft Bamboo Island, across sedgy banks southern extremity New Formosa, Mark get another shot. They landed crept quietly Kangaroo Hill, rabbits grown suspicious, see one, Pan suddenly raced across glade--to great annoyance--and stopped verge wood. There he picked rabbit his mouth, recollected wires set. The rabbit wire since morning. "It Samson," said Bevis. When returned hut full moon--full low down--had begun fill courts sky her light, permitted pause dusk sunset. The slave's cheeks red scorched heat fire, she tended her knees, her chin tawny neck streaked black marks. Handling charred sticks her fingers, fingers transferred charcoal her chin. The hare well cooked considering means, rather want means her command, perhaps first she helped prepare. Searching store-room she found little butter she basted manner; thought butter gone, hasty--impatient--to look thoroughly. There jelly, dry, enjoyed much sitting plank table she would. They removed poles one side she would nothing dread, two sides bars remained, flames expiring fire every cast black bars shadow across table. The slave would glad stayed island night--if lent her great-coat rug roll she would slept anywhere courtyard--but she said Samson would wretched without her, he would frightened miserable. She must go; she would come back morning ten. They filled flag-basket her moorhens, rabbit, dab-chick thrush, tin preserved tongue. There still fragments biscuit; she said Samson would like best all. Thus laden, she would waded mainland, would let her--they took raft ferried her over, promised fetch her morning she would whistle, she could whistle like boy. To Loo voyage raft, short was, something beyond compare. Loo pass prickly stubble fields her bare feet--stubble naked foot broad earth porcupine's back. But long practice taught her wind round edge narrow thistly band grass, thistles she care. "Good-night, slave." They poled back island, fastened Pan up, going bed, Bevis said he wanted matchlock loaded ball he meant rise early try heron. Mark fired off, stillness heard descending shot rattle among trees. The matchlock loaded ball, Bevis set clock his mind wake three. It still early evening, little rest lately, fell asleep instant; asleep long slave crept her window quieted Samson broken biscuits. The alarum his mind awoke Bevis time he wished. He wake Mark, wishing go even quietly usual left Pan fastened up; spaniel gave half-whine, crouched Bevis spoke he recognised potential anger tones his voice. From stockade Bevis went along side island weeds were, passed Calypso left side previous evening. He went "blazed" trees leading Kangaroo Hill, past reed-grass captured slave, saw nothing. Thence he moved noiselessly wood elevated spot spruce firs he thought he could see end island without seen heard. There nothing, overthrown willow trunk lay still water flush surface, close little ripple coming bush, he supposed caused water-rat moving there. Till he absorbed he doing, then, remembering cones hung tops tall firs, he looked became conscious beauty morning, open there, he could see breadth sky. The sun yet stood orient, his precedent light shone translucent blue. Yet blue, word, word possible convey feeling unless one could built signs symbols like book magician, glowed burned fro page. For blue precious sapphire thick it, turquoise dull, hard surfaces compared sand gravel. They stones, hard, cold, pitiful, gives lustre light. Through delicate porcelain sometimes light comes, porcelain, light lovely. But porcelain clay, light shorn, checked, shrunken. Down beauteous azure came Light itself, pure, unreflected Light, untouched, untarnished even dew-sweetened petal flower, descending, flowing like wind, wind glory sweeping blue. A luminous purple glowing Love glows cheek, glowed passion heavens. Two things reach soul. By touch indeed emotion. But light eye, sound voice! soul trembles like flame leaps meet them. So luminous purple azure his heart ascended. Bevis, lover sky, gazed forgot; forgot forget pulses beat, labour make them. Nor he hear south wind singing fir tops. I know slumber them; look clods. The greatest wonder earth able see earth's surpassing beauty. Such moments beyond chronograph measure wheels, passing one cog may equal century, mind time. What incredible marvel human creatures slumber threescore ten years, look clods say, "We old, lived seventy years." Seventy years! The passing one cog longer; seven hundred times seventy years would equal click tiniest cog mind living life. Sleep clods, glory earth, sun, sea, endless ether around us! Incredible marvel sleep clods talk years. But I suppose second two, slight movement attracted him, he looked, instantly vision forgotten. Upon willow trunk prone water, he saw brown creature larger animal commonly seen, chiefly length, sharp-pointed, triangular ears set close head. In his excitement he recognise he aimed. Behind fir trunks he hidden, he high ground--animals seldom look up--the creature's head farthest him. He steadied long, heavy barrel fir trunk, heedless streak viscous turpentine sap his hand pressed. The trigger partly drawn--his arm shook, he sighed--he checked himself, held his breath tight, fired. The ball plunged creature jerked rebounding fell water. He dashed down, leaped in--as happened water shallow--and seized splashed little mere muscular contraction. Aimed head, ball passed clean shoulders buried willow trunk. The animal dead he touched it. He tore home threw bed: "Mark!" "O!" said Mark. "An otter!" Their surprise great, never suspected otter. No one ever seen one heard of, one even supposed possible. These waters far river, fed rivulets supporting nothing beyond kingfisher. To get otter must ascended brook river, bold adventurous journey, passing hatches farmhouses set like forts water's edge, passing mills astride stream. The hare admired, nothing otter, rare black fox. They looked broad flat head--hold cat's head chin, little like it--the sharp, triangular ears set close head, webbed feet, fur, long tail decreasing blunt point. It must preserved; could skin it, could stuff it; still must done. The governor must see it, mamma, Jolly Old Moke, Frances, Val, Cecil, Charlie, Ted, Big Jack--all. Must! This curious wave seen moved without wind--no, Mark remembered near wave he seen something white surface. The wave caused otter, likely otter Pan scented Bamboo Island he seemed excited, could see reason. The otter must preserved--must! While breakfasted, bathed, talk. Presently heard slave's whistle fetched her raft. Now, Loo, cunning hussy, waited till she safely landed island, told dear mamma Frances going day Jack's see them. Loo sent go town errand, she heard mentioned. Instead going errand she ran play slave. Charlie knowledge yesterday, waved his cap instead white handkerchief warning, see it. If mamma Frances drove Jack's see them, course would discovered Jack's, noise would be. "Hateful," said Mark. "It seems we are getting near hateful `Other Side.'" Volume Three, Chapter XV. NEW FORMOSA--THE BLACK SAIL. Now, Other Side, i.e. home, things gone smoothly till day before, measure owing harvest, rest slow ways old-fashioned country people. When gone away Jack's disgrace, Bevis's mother could rest, ticking clock silent house, distant beat blacksmith's hammer, every little circumstance day jarred upon her. But occasion had, she believed, gone pleasure, though she missed them, apart separated gulf anger. Busy harvest, visiting, one came Jack's, two slipped moment life hamlet. Presently Bevis's short affectionate letter arrived, prevented suspicion arising, one noticed postmark. Mamma wrote return, her letter addressed Bevis delivered Jack's would supposed secret would come out. So would town life--a letter would written saying Bevis there, asking forward it. But old house hills. Jack's mother put shelf, remarking doubt Bevis coming, would to-morrow next day. As Jack he busy think it, he he would taken little notice, knowing former experience Bevis might turn moment. The letter remained shelf. On Saturday carrier left parcel Bevis--at time messenger would sent, absence would discovered--but one could spared field. The parcel contained clean collars, cuffs, similar things never thought taking them, mamma forget. Like letter parcel put aside Bevis he come; parcel indeed accepted proof positive he coming. Jack's mother never touched pen she could means avoid it, old country people put letter-writing till absolutely compelled. On Sunday afternoon Bevis Mark lying fir-trees New Formosa, dear mamma, always thinking her boy his friend, her bedroom turning yellowish fly-leaves end old Book Common Prayer, large go fro church, always room. Upon fly-leaves she written time time curious little things Bevis said. In early morning (before he could talk) he used sit bed she still slept, try pick her eyelids open finger thumb. What else could dumb creature wished looked loving eyes fondled? There entered, too, he "Bobby," little boys "Bobbies," he called Bobaysche, said mejjible-bone vegetable marrow. Desiring speak wheat, unable recall proper term, he called bread-seed; one day stroking his favourite kitten asked "If God pussy?" It difficult express time he meant, "When yesterday came yesterday went away," his paraphrase day yesterday. One day sitting-room he fancied hunter dart, seizing poker balanced his head. He became excited he launched his dart flying quarry, went window-pane. In day two--workmen got hurry country--an old glazier trudged put fresh glass, he cut dry putty measured his glass, drew diamond point across, Bevis emptied his tool-basket admired chisels hammers. By by, tired things he permitted use lest he cut himself, he threw handed basket workman: "Here," he said, "Here--take toys!" Toys indeed. The old man laboured fifty years toys till his mind become monotony horny unimpressionable his hand. He smiled: he see meaning childish words convey. Nothing pleased Bevis much moving furniture, noise disturbance distasteful us treat him. It "thunder-boy" "cuckoo-boy," thunder rolled cuckoo called; he could conceive anything caused unseen without human agency. The Deity human. "Ah!" said he thoughtfully, "He got high ladder climbed hedges make thunder." "Has He got little Bobbies?" "No." "I suppose He He here?" "No." "No," (with pity) "He did not peoples." The pleasure refusal resisted. "Now do, Bobby, dear?" "I san't: say again." "O! _do_ it." "I san't: say again." "Now, _do_." "I san't," shaking his head, much say it is dreadful me, I shall not. They could explain glowing sunset really far away, he wanted go it. "It is blackberry hedge." Some one teaching God loved little boys; "But he love ladies too?" As papa he tell stories hour, day day, he ceased said he could remember more, Bevis frowned. "Rack brains! rack brains!" said he. A nightingale built hedge near house, night long her voice echoed bed room. Listening one night he bed he remarked, "The nightingale two songs: first he sings `Sir-rup--sir-rup,' he sings `Tweet.'" For his impudence he box ear: "Pooh! It went pop like foxglove," he laughed. At Brighton he taken Pavilion, trouble explain fine house built gentleman called king. By-and-by, top stories, rather musty old carpets hangings: "Hum!" said he; "seems stuffy. I smell gentleman's dinner," i.e. George Fourth's. Visiting trim suburban villa, ladies talked sent close-mown lawn play. When he came in, "Well, dear, enjoy yourself?" "Do not think much _your_ garden," said Bevis; "no buttercups." At prayers: "Make Bobby good boy, see everything I tell you." "You longered promise," fulfil long time. "Straight yourselves," walking he wished go straight turn. "Round yourselves, round yourselves," he wanted take turning. When he grew big man he expressed his determination "knock policeman kill hanging-man," he could he liked. "Tiffeck" cat's cough. Driving Westminster Bridge first time, seeing Houses Parliament, reminded his toy bricks, he inquired "If anything inside?" Older people asked late years. As he get his wishes quickly, appeared "too many perhapses place:" he wanted things done "punctually now." A waterfall "tumbling water." They told one part us die. "Then," he said directly, "I suppose thinking part." What more, O! Descartes, Plato, philosophers, tomes? The crucifixion hurt his feelings much, cruel nails, unfeeling spear: he looked picture long time, turned page, saying, "If God He would let it." "What going you are man?" asked grandpa. "An engineer, lawyer?" "Pooh! I am going king, wear gold crown!" A glowing March sunset made tops elms, red flower leaf, show clear sky. "They look like red seaweed dipped water," he said. Such short disconnected jottings mamma's prayer-book: mere jottings, well she could see scene her mind words said. Latest all, second visit seaside, where, rioting sands hurling pebbles summer waves, suddenly he stopped, looked her said, "O! was not good thing sea made!" It indeed. Every one much field, mamma left alone, wearying it, asked Frances come frequently her: Frances willing enough so, especially she could talk unreservedly Big Jack, pleasure her come. At last, Friday, Bevis write again, his mother proposed drive Jack's, see boys morrow. Frances discreetly delighted: Jack could come see her now, Bevis's mother she could go see propriety. So agreed dog-cart ready early Saturday afternoon. Charlie learned something this--he played place, waved his cap thrice warning. Now, kitchen Friday evening curious talk Bevis Mark. Had harvest something would crept among cottagers. Such inveterate gossipers would sniffed something, one would supposed this, another would said Big Jack's, third might caught glimpse mainland. But harvest filled hands work, sealed eyes, shut mouths. An earthquake would hardly disturb reapers. So soon completed day's work fell asleep. Pan's nocturnal rambles would noticed this, though he might come Jack's. However, chanced, word said till Friday evening, came kitchen labouring man, sent his master talk Bailiff respecting proposed bargain. Every evening Bailiff took his quart kitchen, though summer always corner hearth. He home, old much-crusted bachelor: he dim craving company, he liked sit sip Polly worked round briskly. A deal gossip got kitchen. Men came out, lingered door-step fingers latch add one remark. That evening bargain, minor matter, discussed, man, much roundabout preliminary solemnly declared he working Rushland's field (about half mile New Sea), he distinctly heard Bevis Mark talking other, seemed sound came water. Sometimes he said he could hear folk talk great distance, four five times far could, frequently told people conversing mile away. He could hear like always, then, he quite sure he heard Master Bevis Master Mark talking something shooting, sound came water. He believe Jack's, "summat" (something) curious it. The Bailiff Polly visitor turned over, gossiped, discussed time, till man go. They never moment doubted perfect truth he stated. Half-educated people always ready believe marvellous, anything unusual claim second sight hearing, say. Once then, country, meet people lay serious claim possess power, astonishing instances related it. Whether much open air sharpens senses, whether sound actually travel water, possible say, whether little suspicion real facts got out, fellow cunningly devised his story knowing sooner later confirmation his wonderful powers hearing would derived discovery Bevis doing. The persons could tell John Young Loo: one spell-bound bribe he knew he obtain, Loo much eager share game breathe word. Poachers, however, get odd hours odd places, see things meant to. Still country belief lingers person possess power, story worked upon Bailiff Polly, last Polly ventured tell her mistress. Her mistress dismissed ridiculous. She well educated dream dreams. Yet she retired, know! she sat little thought it, contagious superstition. In morning she sent Frances come hour earlier--she wanted see Bevis. Frances came, dog-cart door Loo (who sent errand town--a common thing Saturdays) rushed door, thrust letter mamma's hand, darted away. "Why!" said she. "It is Bevis--why!" she read aloud, Frances looking her shoulder:--"Dear Mamma, Please come place boats kept directly get mind come minute," (twice dashed). "We coming home New Formosa ship Calypso, want see things brought you, hear it. Mind sure come minute, please." Wondering excited curiosity, two ladies ran fast could meadow footpath, along bank New Sea, till came clear place trees interfere view. Then, long way up, saw singular-looking boat black sail. "There are!" "They are coming!" "What _can_ doing?" "That Pinta!" "This black sail!" The sail black rug, old-fashioned one, black one side grey other. After long discussion Bevis Mark decided time come must return island, Bevis's mother went Jack's found there, her anxiety would terrible, could think it. So Bevis wrote letter sent Loo back once, she watch see his mother she asked. If she started shore Loo raise signal, handkerchief lent her purpose. Some time Loo went embarked raft, drifted slowly south wind till reached Mozambique, stayed raft's progress poles till Loo displayed signal. The sail hoisted, bore right wind. With dark sail booming Calypso surged ahead, mariners saw two ladies shore, waved hands shouted. Bevis steered her port, she grounded beside Pinta. The first caress astonishment over: "Where hats?" said Frances. "Where collars?" said his mother. "And gracious, child! look his neck!" As hats collars almost forgotten existence, passed time shirt sleeves like gold-miners, necks chests exposed, brown tropics. Mark especially tanned, completely tanned: Bevis fair brown well. The sun wind purified his skin almost transparency rosy olive behind whiteness. There gleam his eye, clear red his lips--lips speak state blood--the easy motion limbs, ringing sound voice, upright back, showed primeval health. Both often surprised strength. In days running, racing, leaping, exploring, swimming, skin nude sun, wind water, built steel, steel would bear hardest wear world. Had put open boat thrust forth sea like viking old, would hurt them. Frances played Bevis's golden ringlets, kiss she used do. He looked much man. She placed her hand her brother's shoulder, speak she done. Something told her boy she ordered fro. They could believe two really spent time island. This eleventh morn since left--it could be: yet raft evidence. "Let us row Pinta," said Mark. "In minute," said Bevis. "Get her ready; I will back minute-- half second." He ran along bank spot whence he knew he could see old house home boughs. He wanted look it--there house beautiful one born in--and he ran back. There little water boat much, hauled ballast, ladies got rowed direct New Formosa. The stockade--so well defended, cage door, hut, cave, interest knew bounds. "But really sleep this," said Bevis's mother tone horror, finding bed nothing fir branches: she could reconciled idea. The matchlock, niche lantern, marks fires been, sun-dial, detail examine: lastly went round island well-worn path. This occupied considerable time, late drive Jack's object removed, Bevis's mother, ever anxious others' happiness, whispered Frances she would write send messenger, ask Jack come to-morrow--surely he could spare Sunday--to bring back parcel, see wonderful island. When last landed ladies, Charlie bank, Cecil Val, somehow got wind it--they wild curiosity unmingled resentment. These rowed New Formosa stayed longer even ladies, insisted shot matchlock. So exciting afternoon returned shipwrecked folks. In evening dog-cart, drove Latten otter preserved. They see much think much governor till towards supper-time--Mark snatched half hour visit his Jolly Old Moke returned like wind. The governor calmly incredulous: he professed disbelieve done themselves, must man two help them. And true, suppose going pay damage done trees island? This difficult question, know governor could cut trees he chose, indeed never thought it. But faced many dangers going tremble this. They could quite make governor out, whether he chaffing them, whether he really disbelieved, whether cover his anger. In truth, he hardly knew himself, he could help admiring ingenuity effected this. He shrewd man, governor, he saw Bevis Mark ladies side; use saying anything ladies made minds? Besides, rate: gained primeval health primeval forest-dwellers. Before gleaming eyes, red lips, sun-burned yet clear skin, ringing voices shouts laughter, could he help waver finally melt become curious rest. In end actually promised, favour, row island to-morrow. Volume Three, Chapter XVI. SHOOTING WITH DOUBLE-BARRELS. The governor rowed island, examined fortifications, read journal, looked iron-pipe gun, afterwards reflecting upon things came conclusion would safer better every way let Bevis use good breech-loader. He evidently must shoot, he better shoot proper gun. When decision known, Mark's governor could nothing less, good guns put hands. In truth, prohibition long rather hollow, traditional effectual. Bevis accompanied his governor several autumns field, shot occasionally, he frequently allowed try his skill starlings flying fro chimney. Besides shot Jack knew perfectly well. They fortunate living era breech-loader much safer old muzzle-loading gun. There hardly part muzzle-loader way contribute accidents. With breech-loader moment remove possibility accident pulling cartridges putting pocket. Bevis Mark knew well shoot, actual occasional practice, watching shoot. The governor, however, desirous excel, gave good drilling way. Bevis study his position moment he stopped lifted gun. His left foot set little front other, he turn slightly aside, left shoulder forwards. He never stand square game. He stand upright, perfectly upright like bolt. The back must stoop shoulders humped set till collar coat high poll. Humping shoulders time contracts chest, causes coat front crease, creases apt catch butt gun comes shoulder divert proper place. There time correct act shooting, habit good position acquired may avoided. He had, too, hold his head nearly upright crane his neck forward till cheek rested stock head aside manner magpie peering letter. He stand upright, his chest open his shoulders thrown back, like Robin Hood his six foot yew drawing arrow his ear. Bevis made take his double-barrel upstairs, best bedroom--this advantage breech-loader, take cartridges harmless fire-iron--where modern cheval-glass. The mirrors stairs old small, glass perfectly homogeneous unless reflection face fell centre round chin became elongated. Before cheval-glass he ordered stand sideways throw gun quickly present, holding there, glance himself. He saw his frame arched forward, his back bent, his shoulders drawn together, collar his coat his poll behind, entire position cramped awkward. Now he understood unsightly looked, difficult shoot well way. Many good sportsmen dint twenty years' cramping educate awkwardness successful pitch. It needs many years it: stand upright once. He altered his posture moment, looked, saw standing easily, upright easily, found his heart beat without vibrating barrel chest contracted, breathing throw gun level. Instead compressing gun, gun fitted him. The gun his master controlled him, he master gun. Next he practise bringing gun shoulder--the act lifting it--and choose position he would usually lift it. He his free choice, informed he selected he must adhere it. Some generally carry gun hollow left arm muzzle nearly horizontal left. Some right arm left hand already stock. Some muzzle upwards aslant hands also. Now one waits butt his hip: one swings his gun anyhow one hand like umbrella: third tosses his shoulder hammers trigger-guard up, jerks muzzle game rises. Except snap-shooting, gun must necessity held already half-way shoulder, matters little sportsman does, position he raises his gun. But governor insisted matter everything position habitual. That order shoot success, gun must thrown one way another, must almost invariably, certainly rule, lifted one recognised position. Else many trifling circumstances interfere precision without nothing done, crease coat, button, sleeve, might, forgetting yourself, knock barrel bough. To avoid must take mind game guide gun shoulder. If took mind game continuity glance broken, aim snapped two, united. Therefore, he insisted Bevis choosing position he would habitually carry his gun presence game. Bevis selected gun hollow his left arm, muzzle somewhat upwards; simply imitation, governor held way. It is, however, good position, easy walking waiting ground game game flies, hare snipe, everything except thick cover brushwood, moving double mound, must perforce hold gun almost perpendicular escape branches. This settled, governor promised faithfully he saw carry way he would lock gun week time, proceeded practise bringing gun shoulder, is, present. The left hand always grasp stock spot gun balances, poised palm like beam weights scales. Instead taking front trigger-guard, trigger-guard, six seven inches front, carelessly seizing different places happens, left hand always come spot. It undeviatingly little practice without thought effort, right hand meets friend's shake hands. If comes always spot left hand require shifting butt touches shoulder. The necessary movements reduced minimum. Grasping balance lift gently shoulder, neither hastily slowly, quiet ease. Bevis particularly taught throw butt his shoulder jerk, he bring deliberate motion "hefting." "Hefting" weighing hands--you asked "heft" thing--to take feel raising think weighs. With considerate ease Bevis "heft" his gun shoulder, press sufficiently feel butt touched him. He hold loosely, pull his shoulder he going mortice there. He feel it. If press gun hard iron stiffness shoulder cannot move follow flying bird: pull resist yourself. On hand, loosely held gun apt shift. The butt must touch his shoulder place every time. Those pointed frequently thick upper part butt high shoulder, really put nothing narrow angular lower part body. At another time, throwing low, bend stoop gun get aim. Or pitched chest, shoulder all--to edge chest, outside shoulder arm. They never bring twice place must consequently change inclination head every shot. A fresh effort has, therefore, gone time get body gun fit. Bevis compelled bring butt his gun every time spot well his shoulder, his chest his arm, hollow butt fitting, like ball socket. One great objects mechanical training he pay least attention breech gun aiming. All he sight. His gun, he thus practised, came exactly level once. It required shifting, moving left hand lower stock, pushing butt higher shoulder, side that. His gun touched his shoulder perfect level, straight he thrust his hand pointed index finger bird. Not least conscious effort needed, nothing correct, second's interruption continuity glance--the look game. The breech level sight instantly; he sight. With eyes open he never lost view bird tenth second. The governor taught keep his eyes, open, bird flew, his gun came his line sight. The black dot end barrel--as sight appears act shooting--had cover bird, finger pressed trigger. Up moment black dot adjusted mark automatic. The governor's plan first reduce movements minimum; secondly, obtain absolute uniformity movement; thirdly, secure absolute uniformity perfect unconsciousness effort movement all; short, automatic movement; order continuity glance, look game, might interrupted merest fraction second. That glance really aim, gun fitted gaze thrust index finger point, body really work aiming itself. All mind effect final adjustment black dot sight. Very often gun thus brought adjustment necessary, already there, nothing press trigger. It looked gun touched shoulder discharged instantaneously. He look bird, keep eyes it, let his gun come his eyes, still open, adjust dot fire. There binocular trouble he never stay run his eyes barrels--that would necessitate removing his glance game, thing strictly forbidden. Only dot. He saw dot, dot gave binocular trouble. The barrels entirely ignored; body already adjusted them. Only dot. The sight--this dot--is secret shooting. The governor said shut left eye cannot retain glance bird, barrels invariably obscure moment, mind catch again. He would let Bevis take his eyes it--he would rather he missed. Bevis also careful let his right hand hang weight his arm stock, thing doubles labour left arm uphold weight gun right arm too, thus muzzle apt depressed. He blink, look explosion. Hundreds sportsmen blink pull trigger. He let his gun smoothly follow bird, even act explosion, exactly astronomer's clockwork equatorial follows star. There continuity glance; thus last he brought his snipes right left, seemed, sweep gun. The astronomers discovered "personal equation." Three men set observe occultation satellite Jupiter, record precise time pressing lever. One presses lever hundredth second soon, second hundredth second late, third sometimes one sometimes sometimes precisely accurate. The mean three gives exact time. In shooting one man pulls trigger fraction soon, another fraction late, third uncertain. If best shoot well, years still fail, endeavour discover "personal equation," correcting may succeed much better. It common error unsuspected, blinking--you may shoot years never know blink. Bevis's personal equation second quick. In this, everything, he dashed it. His snipes cut whipped over: his hares mangled; his partridges smashed. The dot dead them, volley lead poured in. The governor difficulty get give "law" enough. He acquired mechanical precision perfectly he became careless shot gracelessly. The governor lectured hung his gun week check. By degrees he got easy quiet style finished shooting. The two learned better quicker two. The governor went drill Mark, motion motion, word word. Then field one told other, compared experiences, checked other's faults, commended success. They learned better quicker keeper find everything them, warn expect hare, bird. They find like Pan. Finally, learned better first shot anything took fancy, blackbird wood-pigeon, restricted one class bird kind motion every time flushed. Long trusted guns gathered conversation constantly heard around aim bird flies straight away usually rises gradually distance, ears running hare. If hare came towards shot grass his paws. A bird flying aslant away needs sight put front it, allowance increasing angle approaches right angle; till bird crosses, straight across, must allow good piece, especially he comes wind. Two cautions governor gave them, one extremely careful getting hedges muzzles guns pointed away, branches treacherous, secondly never put forefinger inside trigger-guard till act lifting gun shoulder. For awhile territory limited governor, shot Mark's, want sport spoiled beginners. But September drew close, could wander almost liked, October anywhere, promise shooting pheasants come across any. Volume Three, Chapter XVII. AMERICAN SNAP-SHOOTING. Meantime taught Big Jack swim. He came look cave New Formosa, Frances taunted tormented boys could swim he could not, last giant, were, heaved effort, rode every morning. Bevis Mark gave lessons, fortnight he could swim four five strokes railings. Directly he stroke he got rapidly, vast lungs his, formed air hills, floated buoyantly balloon. So soon ever he could swim, Frances turned round tormented boys taught he boys. Bevis Mark could break habit bathing every morning, continued far October, often walking bare feet hoar-frost grass, breaking thin ice edge water tapping toes. The bath plunge again, gave pleasant glow day, hardened smith hardens iron. Up Jack's tried his little rifle, applying learnt matchlock shooting ball, soon found rifle's peculiarities. It wanted understood coaxed like everything else. Then could hit anything sixty yards. Beyond bullet, beaten shape driven home ramrod, could depended upon. In October could shoot pleased condition sparing pheasants governors. There preserved covers, pheasants wandered away came there. October beautiful month. One morning Tom, ploughboy, time bird-keeper, came door asked see them. "There pussy mound," he said, sly leer peculiar bring information game. He "knowed" hare mound, yet he could given positive reason it. He actually seen hare enter mound, found run, form, neither he Pan's intelligent nostrils, he "knowed" same. Rude he looked he instinctive perception--supersensuous perception--that hare mound, twenty people might passed without least suspicion. "Go kitchen," said Bevis, Tom went broad smile content his features, he well knew sent kitchen equivalent cheque drawn cellar pantry. Bevis Mark took guns, Pan followed happily, walked beside hedges towards place, distance. The keenness morning air, sun yet fully distilled frost night, freshened eagerness sport. A cart laden swedes crossed front them, though sun shone load roots indicated winter approaching. They passed oak growing field. Under tree stood aged man one hand hoary trunk, looking tree well his bowed back, stiffened stoop, his rounded shoulders would let him. His dress old sober tinted, his smock frock greyish, his old hat lost colour. He hoary like lichen-hung oak trunk. From his face blood dried away, leaving dull brown, tan seventy harvest fields burned skin, sapless brown wrinkled face like withered oak leaf. Though he looked them, Bevis nodded, his eyes gave sign recognition; like dead animal's, light them, glaze settling. In evening might occur he seen morning. His years pressed heavy him, heavy like huge bundle sticks; he lost his age. All years "Jumps" never sight high Down yonder (not far Jack's), landmark place. Within sight hill he born, within radius he laboured, therein he decaying, slowly, slowly, like oak branch. James his real name, corrupted "Jumps;" "Jumps" he known two generations, he would answered other. One day happened "Jumps" searching dead sticks came along sycamore-trees saw Jack, Bevis Mark swimming. He watched time his dull glazing eyes, day two afterwards opened his mouth it. "Never seed nobody thuck afore," he said, repeating score times his class do, impressing idea others reiteration, takes much iteration impress them. "Never saw one before." For seventy harvests he laboured place, never gone sight high Down yonder, seventy years one till Bevis Mark, pupil Jack, learned swim. Bevis's governor question, he crossed seas. But true country-folk, dwelt round waters, one learned swim. Very likely one learned since Norman conquest. When forests enclosed commonalty forbidden hunt, spirit enterprising exercise died them. Certainly fact quite recently might search village end end find swimmer, probably found one he would something traveller home-staying man. Tom, ploughboy bird-keeper, his companions, plough-lads young men, sometimes bathed summer brook far meadows, splashing like blackbirds shallow water, running fro sward grey-leaved willows sunshine limbs. I delight see them, look Greek; I wish one would paint them, brimming brook, willows pondering it, pointed flags, sward, buttercups, distant flesh-tints sunlight grey leaves. But swimming. "Never saw one before," said man seventy harvests. Under oak he stood Bevis Mark passed October morning. His hand like wood upon wood, he leaned oak, his knees bent one way his back other, thus stiff crooked standing effort supported tree, seemed he going beast field upon fours hoisted upright difficulty. Something position, hoary tree, greyish hue his dress gave impression arboreal animal. But tree leaned also long slender pole, "teeled up" "Jumps" would said, end pole hook. The old man permission collect dead wood, use his crook tear decaying branches he looking. A crook simple instrument--the mere branch tree often serve crook--but arboreal animal ever used crook. Ah! "Jumps," poor decaying "Jumps," lengthened narrow experience like long footpath, glazing eyes, crooked knee, stiffened back, something thee that, unseen difference all, wondrous mind, soul. Up sunshine lark sung fluttering his wings; he arose earth, his heart sky. Shall soul arise? Past oak Bevis Mark walked beside hedge upon way. Frost, sunshine reddened hawthorn sprays, already could see upper branches--red haws--for grass strewn leaves exposed tops bushes. On orange maples bunches rosy-winged keys. There gloss holly leaf, catkins tips leafless birch. As leaves fell horse-chestnut boughs varnished sheaths buds next year appeared; green buds willows, black tips ash saplings, green buds sycamores. They waited asleep sheaths till Orion strode southern sky Arcturus rose East. Slender larch boughs coated yellow fluff decaying needles. Brown fern, shrivelled rush tip, grey rowen grass verge ditch showed frost wandered thither night. By pond brown bur-marigolds drooped, withering seed, dull disks like lesser sunflowers without sunflower's colour. There beech orange, red topmost branch lowest, redder squirrels came it. Two three last buttercups flowered grass, furze bush pale yellow blossoms golden spring, pale. Thin threads gossamer gleamed, light ran along loops lifted breeze, sky blue buff oaks. Jays screeched oaks looking acorns, came muffled tinkle sheep-bell. A humble-bee buzzed across path, warmed aimless life sun his frost-chill night-- buzzed across drifted hawthorn branch. There he clung crept branch, his raft sunshine, men chilled sea cling creep platform beams waste waves. His feeble force almost spent. The sun shone his rays fell red hawthorn spray, yellow larch bough, brown fern, rush tip, grey grass, red beech yellow gorse, broad buff oaks orange maple, gleaming pond. Wheresoever least colour sun's rays flew like bee flower, drew beauty drew song lark. The wind came blue sky drifting skeins mist like curled summer's dawn waters New Sea, wind came blood glowed walked. King October reigned, wind his mantle he drew puffed leaves trees. June queen months, October king. "Busk ye bowne ye merry men all:" sharpen arrows string bows; set ye order march, march woods away. The wind came rippled blood glow, rippled water. A lissom steely sense strung sinews; backs felt like oak-plants, upright, sturdy rigid; frames charged force. This fierce sense life like glow furnace draught comes; there is light eye like first star evening blue. Afar flock rooks soared, winding round round geometrical staircase air, outstretched wings like leaves upborne slowly rotating edge first. The ploughshare work planing stubble filling breeze scent earth. Over ploughshare soared danced joyous measure. Upon tops elms redwings sat--high-flying thrushes speck blood wing--and called "kuck--quck" approached. When came mound Bevis went one side hedge Mark other. Then word Pan rushed mound like javelin, splintering dry hollow "gix" stalks, thorn pierced his shaggy coat drew "yap" him. At hare waited longer, lightly leaped mound thirty yards ahead. Bound! Bound! Bevis poised his gun, got dot fleeting ears, hare rolled still. So passed October, sometimes seeing snipe sandy shallow brook willow came round bend. The wild-fowl began come New Sea, older wilder, easy shoot. One day rowing Pinta saw magic wave, followed up, till Mark shot creature caused it, found large diving bird. Several times Bevis fired herons came over. Towards evening returning homewards one would pass, though he knew height much he could resist firing broad mark wide wings offered. The heron, perhaps touched, unharmed pellets whose sting left them, almost tumbled fright, soon recovered his gravity resumed his course. Somewhat later governor business London took Bevis Mark him. They stayed week Bevis's grandpa's, there, Bevis's special pleasure, governor went one evening see celebrated American sportsman shoot. This pale-face land Indians quite upset revolutionised ideas handle gun. The perfection first-rate English weapons, accuracy almost absolute safety, obtained pre-eminence fire-arms. It England art shooting slowly brought delicate precision enables sportsman kill right left instantaneous succession. But one thing escape discovery? Why many thousands shot season season without hitting upon it? The governor like his philosophy gun upset way; his cherished traditions overthrown. There American stood stage calm tenor singer, every time glass ball thrown up, smash! single rifle-bullet broke it. A single bullet, shot, cartridge opens makes pattern foot diameter, one single bullet. It shooting flying rifle. It once, twice, thrice, tens hundreds. The man's accuracy aim seemed inexhaustible. Never exhibition entirely genuine: never anything bewildering gunner bred traditionary system shooting. A thousand rifle-bullets pattering succession glass balls jerked air would past credibility witnessed crowds. The word spectators would disbelieved. "It quite upside down, this," said governor. "Really one would think glass balls burst themselves." "He could shoot partridges flying his rifle," said Mark. Bevis said nothing sat absorbed exhibition till last shot fired rose seats, he said, "I know he it!" "Nonsense." "I am sure I do: I saw minute." "Well, then?" "I will tell get home." "Pooh!" "Wait see." Nothing said till reached home, half scornfully inquired secret lay? "The secret this," said Bevis, holding his left arm. "That is secret." "How? I do not see." "He puts his left arm nearly far he reach," said Bevis, "and holds gun almost muzzle. That is he it. Here, see--like this." He took his grandfather's gun muzzle-loader shot thirty years, put his shoulder, stretching his left arm grasping barrels high beyond stock. His long arm reached within inches muzzle. "There!" he said. "Well, like that," said Mark. "He certainly hold gun like that." "But difference?" said governor. "I do not see it is done now." "But I do," said Bevis. "Just think: hold gun like this, put left arm high near muzzle can, put muzzle mark directly instead move find it. And that is it, I am sure. I saw he held directly, I thought out." "Let me," said Mark. He gun tried, aiming quickly object mantelpiece. "So can--you put barrels right it." "Give me," said governor. He tried, twice, thrice, throwing gun quickly. "Keep left hand one place," said Bevis. "Not two places--do not move it." "I believe he is right," said governor. "Of course I am," said Bevis high triumph. "I am sure that is it." "So I," said Mark. "Well, really I come try, I think is," said governor. "It is like rod pivot," said Bevis. "Do not see left hand pivot: hold far can, Long part rod side pivot, short little piece beyond it--then you have got move little piece. If shoot old way long piece side pivot, course least motion makes difference. Here, where is paper--I see it, cannot." With his pencil he drew diagram, always ready draw maps plans kinds. He drew back card chanced lie table. "There, long straight stroke, that is line gun--it is three inches long--now, see, put A top, B bottom like geometry. Now make dot C line inch B. Now suppose B stock touches shoulder, dot C hand holds gun old way home. Then, do not see, least mistake C, ever little, increases A-- ratio right word, increases rapid ratio, time shot gets bird it is half yard one side." "I see," said Mark. "Now other." "Rub dot C," said Bevis. "I have not got indiarubber, suppose it is rubbed out: put dot, two inches B, one inch top gun A. That is he held his hand dot, say D." "I think he did," said governor. "Now think," said Bevis. "It takes quite sweep, quite movement make top A incline much perpendicular. I mean pivot, that is hand, D little mistake increase anything like rapidly. So much easy shoot straight quick." They considered till got understand it. All time Bevis's mind working try find better illustration, last he snatched governor's walking-stick. The knob handle he held his right hand, represented butt gun pressed shoulder. His right hand he rested table, keeping still shoulder would still. Then he took stick thumb finger his left hand one third length stick up. That place gun would held ordinary way. "Now look," he said, keeping his right hand firm, he moved his left inch aside. The inch his hand increased three four point stick. This initial error aim would go increasing till forty yards widest spread shot would miss mark. "And way," said Bevis. He slipped his left hand stick within seven eight inches point. This represented new position. A small error here--or lateral motion hand--only produced small divergence. The muzzle, top stick, varied straight line amount actual movement left hand. In former case slight error hand multiplied muzzle. This convinced them. "How shall shoot!" said Mark. "We shall beat Jack hollow!" They returned home two days afterwards, immediately tried experiment double-barrels. It answered perfectly. As Bevis said, secret left arm. When shoot grasp gun left hand high barrel possible without inconveniently straining muscles, bring shoulder. Push muzzle mark, muzzle going actually touch it. The left hand aims, positively putting muzzle game. All centred left hand. The left hand must first movement take hold high up, must slid there, must take hold high near muzzle possible without straining. The left hand thrust out, put game. Educate left arm; teach correspond instantaneously direction glance; teach absolutely stable three necessary seconds; let mind act left wrist. The left hand aims. This double-barrel shot gun; rifle short sporting ranges modification one pellet instead two hundred, sight must used dot put mark, shot gun time scarcely use sight all. With rifle sight must never forgotten. The left hand puts sight mark, quicker trigger pressed better, exactly reversing tradition. A slow deliberative rifleman always considered successful, new system fire cannot delivered quickly, instant sight mark, thus converting rifleman snap-shooter. Of course always understood applies short sporting ranges, method sporting only, apply long range. One caution necessary shooting like double-barrel. Be certain use first-class weapon, quite safe. The left hand nearly top barrel, left hand itself, whole length left arm exposed case gun bursting. I feel cheap guns quite safe. With good gun known maker danger. The American many imitators, one reached his degree excellence new art he invented. Perhaps fortunate every one achieve marvellous dexterity, shooting would speedily empty every cover country. Big Jack learned trick short time. His strong left arm steady rock. He tried his little rifle, actually killed hare, he started furze bush, ran single bullet. But governor though convinced would adopt new practice. He adhered old way, way he learned boy. What learn youth influences us life. But Bevis Mark, Big Jack used tremendous effect snap-shooting lanes game ran flew across, ferreting rabbits bolted hole hole, snipe shooting, hedge-hunting, one side--the best sport, know may turn next, hare, rabbit, partridge dry ditch, woodcock dead leaves. Volume Three, Chapter XVIII. THE ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION--CONCLUSION. The winter remained mild till early January first green leaves appeared woodbine. One evening Polly announced going freeze, cat he sat hearthrug put his paw his ear. If he sat his back fire, sign rain. If he put his paw his ear indicated frost. It freeze hard. The wind still, New Sea soon frozen except two places. There breathing-hole Fir-Tree Gulf fifty sixty yards mouth Nile. The channel New Formosa Serendib "catch," perhaps current Sweet River Falls because, though could skate within twenty yards, could land islands. Jack Frances came skate day day; Bevis Mark Ted, Cecil, rest fought hockey battles hours together. One afternoon, little tired, Bevis sat ice, presently lay moment full length, looking along ice--as he looked along his gun--he found he could see sticks stones anything chanced great distance off. Trying he could see skates people nearly half mile distant, though his eyes close surface, even he placed side his head actually ice. The skates gleamed sun, he could see distinctly; sticks lying ice clearly seen far that, long way, ice seemed perfectly level. As sun sank ice became rosy, reflecting light sky; distant Downs tinted colour. After dark Bevis got lantern Mark took five six hundred yards ice, set surface. Bevis put his face ice he done afternoon looked along. His idea try see far lantern would visible, sticks skates visible good way, he supposed light would apparent much farther. Instead which, he got position looked along ice his face touching it, lantern quite disappeared, yet far he seen skates--skates inch high, candle lantern four five. He skated two hundred yards nearer, tried. At distance, his eyes close ice he could get them, he could see light itself, glow diffused air he knew was. This explained light disappeared. There faint invisible mist ice--the iceblink--which long distance concealed lantern. If he lifted his head eighteen inches he could see light stratum mist, iceblink, appeared eighteen inches thickness. When he skated another hundred yards closer he could see light his face ice he done skates day. So sunset evident mist formed air ice. Mark tried experiment result, skated slowly homewards, moonlight might get fall coming piece twig half-sunk frozen firmly. Suddenly sound like boom cannon, crack shot across broad water shore shore. The "who-hoo-whoop" noise echoed back wood hill, heard coombes valleys, rolling along. As ice four five inches thick parted hollow roar: crack sometimes forked, second running report followed first. Sometimes crack seemed happen simultaneously across water. Occasionally could hear coming, distinct interval time reached them. Up cracks splits little water oozed, freezing surface formed barriers rough ice shore shore, jarred skates passed over. These splits degree impaired strength ice. Later retired opened window heard boom again, weird strange silence night. One day rabbit started bunch frozen rushes shore, chased ice, overtaking ease. They could knocked hockey sticks, forebore so. From rush-bunches flushed dab-chicks lesser grebes which, open water, cannot got fly. Till air still, presently wind blew south almost gale, straight water, keeping skates together spreading coats sails drove wind tremendous pace, flying past trees accumulating velocity ankles ached vibration skates. Nor could stop means describing wide circle, gradually facing wind. Bevis began make ice-raft slide runners go wind sail like ice-yachts American lakes. But time frame put together, blacksmith finished runners, thaw set in. It sleighs, directly sleigh got work, snow goes leaves heaviest muddiest road year. The ice-yachts America must give splendid sport; said sometimes glide rate mile minute, actually outstripping speed wind drives them. This rather puzzle so. May Bevis Mark spread coats like sails flew gale speed needed nerve stand upright--till vibration skates caused peculiar numblike feeling ankles? They either seemed go faster wind, accumulation velocity? As bullet dropped window falls many feet first second, great many next second, increasing pace, thrust forwards wind bodies accumulated impetus shot beyond it. Possibly swift ice-yacht. The thaw great disappointment. The immense waves ocean rise wind, wind rushing ice longer firm rigid quickly broke surface, tremendous grinding splintering, chafing fragments. For first days carried New Sea, presently wind changed. The black north swooped earth swept across waters. Fields, trees, woods, hills, houses looked dark hard, water grey, sky cold dusky. The broken ice drifted swept end New Sea jammed islands. They could get Pinta, resolved sail. "An arctic expedition!" "Antarctic--it south!" "All right." "Let us go New Formosa." "So will. But ice jammed there." "Cut it." "Make ice-bow." "Be quick." Up workshop quickly nailed two short boards together like V. This lashed stem Pinta protect her crashed ice. They took reef mainsail, though wind seem travel swifter, yet winter somehow feels hard compact greater power presses against. Just cast loose, Frances appeared bank above, she called house, hearing about, hastened join expedition. So soon she got comfortable seat, well wrapped sealskin muff, pushed off, Pinta began run wind. It strong, much stronger seemed ashore, pushing sail solid thing. The waves followed, grey cold water lapped stern. Beyond battle-field entered broadest open part black north roared rushed them, pressure sky descending forced furious blast surface. Angry repellent waves hissed crests blew cold foam spray, stinging cheeks. Ahead red sun sinking New Formosa, raced towards disc, sail straining would split. As boat drew near saw ice jammed channel two islands. It thin fragments; water, piled waves rest, almost perpendicular, like sheet glass standing upright reflecting red sunset. Against cliff waves breaking threw fragments ice smashed pieces; ice spray rushed steep sand slid again. But islands waves wreaked fury. The edge ice torn jagged bits dashed other, white saw-like points appearing, forced larger block. Farther ice heaved waves rolled under: surface formed plates placed like row books fallen aside. As ice heaved plates slid other, others underneath striving rise surface struck cracked them. Down came black north man might bring sledge-hammer anvil, waves hissed, turned darker, white sea-gull (which come inland) rose higher level easy strokes wings. Splinter--splanter! Crash! grind, roar; noise like thousands gnashing teeth. "O!" said Frances, dropping her muff, putting her hands her ears. "It Dante!" Bevis his hand tiller; Mark his halyard mainsail; neither spoke, looked doubtful. The next instant Pinta struck ice midway islands, impetus she came drove her six seven feet clear splintering fragments. They jerked forwards, instant following wave broke stern, another, flooding bottom boat. Mark mainsail down, would torn mast out. With splintering, grinding, crashing, roaring, horrible inexpressible noise chaos--an orderless, rhythmless noise chaos-- mass gave way swept slowly channel. The impact boat acted like battering-ram started jam. Fortunate so, boat might swamped following waves. Bevis got scull, Mark, exertions kept her straight; she turned broadside would awkward even was. They swept channel, ice edges barking willow branches planing shore, large plates forced high dry. "Hurrah!" shouted Mark. "Hurrah!" At noise shouting thousands starlings rose osiers Serendib loud rush wings, blackening air like cloud. They soon channel, ice spread open water, worked boat shelter New Formosa, landed. "You wet," said Bevis he helped Frances out. "But it is jolly!" said Frances, laughing. "Only think fright _he_ would he known!" Having made boat safe--there lot water her--they walked along old path, covered dead leaves damp thaw, stockade. The place strewn small branches whirled trees gales, hut corner cave heaps brown oak leaves drifted in. Nothing else changed; well built roof neither broken destroyed winds. During frost blackbird roosted corner hut rafters, sparrows sought shelter, wrens blue-tits crept crevices eaves. Next went cliff, sun-dial stood left it, sun down. From height, could hardly stand wind, saw figure afar green hill sycamores, knew must Big Jack waiting return. Walking back Pinta passed leafless teak-tree marked scored bullets fired it. Before embarking baled water boat, inclined her, first one side other, see she sprung leak, she not. The ice-bow hoisted board, would longer required, would impede sailing. Frances stepped in, Bevis Mark settled row channel. With wind impossible tack narrow strait islands. They pull hardest get through. So soon got offing sculls shipped, sails hoisted, could get work blown back within thirty yards cliff. Then sails drew, forged ahead. It roughest voyage ever had. The wind dead them, matter tack every wave sent spray, sometimes whole crest bows. The shock sometimes seemed hold Pinta mid-career, her timbers trembled. Then she leaped forward cut through, showering spray aside. Frances laughed sang, though words inaudible hiss roar rush gale rigging, sharp, whip-like cracks fluttering pennant. The velocity course carried fro darkening waters minutes, dusk fell quickly, time reached Fir-Tree Gulf, could get still longer "leg" tack, evening gloom settled down. Big Jack stood shore, beckoned come in: could easily landed Frances lee hill, she said she go way now. So tacked Mozambique, past Thessaly bluff, waves getting less size approached northern shore, till glided harbour. Jack walked round met them. He held his hand, Frances sprang ashore. "How _could_ you?" he said, tone indignant relief. To looked terrible risk. "Why splendid!" said Frances, went together towards Longcot. Bevis Mark stayed furl sails, leave Pinta ship-shape. By time finished already dark: night come. On way home paused moment great oak top Home Field, looked back. The whole south burned stars. There roar oak like thunder sea. The sky black, black velvet, black north come down, stars shone burned wind reached fanned flame. Large Sirius flashed; vast Orion strode sky, lording heavens his sword. A scintillation rushed across zenith southern horizon. The black north held buds, force already must push leaf Arcturus rose East. Listening loud roar oak strength north wind filled them,-- "I like go straight real great sea like wind," said Mark. "We _must_ go great sea," said Bevis. "Look Orion!" The wind went seawards, stars always ocean. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The End.
