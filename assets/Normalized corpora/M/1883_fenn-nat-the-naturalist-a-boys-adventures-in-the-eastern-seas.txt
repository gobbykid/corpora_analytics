 NAT THE NATURALIST; OR, A BOY'S ADVENTURES IN THE EASTERN SEAS, CHAPTER ONE. WHY I WENT TO MY UNCLE'S. "I do not know him. I never saw boy--a miserable little coward, always mischief things he ought do, running place his whims fads. I wish you would send right away, I do." My aunt went room, I cannot say she banged door, she shut hard, leaving uncle face face staring one other. My uncle speak minutes, sat poking his hair waxy end his pipe, he man smoked great deal dinner; mornings he spent his garden, early five of the clock summer paying little attention rain. He amiable, mild-tempered man, never children, fact he marry till quite late life; I remember poor father saying aunt married uncle, uncle would never courage ask her. I say "my poor father", couple years marriage, news came home he lost sea whole crew great vessel he surgeon. I remember well; terrible blank trouble seemed come upon house, mother's illness followed, dreadful day Uncle Joseph came down-stairs dining-room, seating fire filled lit his pipe, took two three puffs, threw pipe grate, let his head go upon his hands, cried like child. A minute two later, I went great trouble laid hand upon his shoulder, saying, "Do not cry, uncle; she will better soon," he caught his arms held his breast. "Nat, boy," he said, "I have promised her I will like father now, I will." I knew soon he said words, week later I orphan boy indeed; I Uncle Joseph's house, feeling miserable unhappy spite his kind ways pains he took make comfortable. I wretched I alone uncle garden, he would talk his peas potatoes fruit-trees, show find snails slugs, encourage shoot thieving birds crossbow arrow; I miserable indeed I went in, aunt sharp, acid sort woman, seemed one idea, keep house terribly tidy always uncomfortable people it. It used be, "Nat, wiped shoes?" "Let look, sir. Ah! I thought so. Not half wiped. Go take directly, put slippers. You are bad uncle, sir." I used think I like good. "I declare," said aunt, "I have not bit peace life dirt dust. The water-cart never comes round roads, house gets filthy. Moil toil, moil toil, morning night, thanks whatever." When aunt talked like she used screw her face seem she going cry, she spoke whining, unpleasant tone voice; I never remember seeing her cry, I used wonder she would trouble herself dusting cloth feather brush morning night, three servants work. I heard cook tell Jane housemaid Mrs Pilgarlic never satisfied; time I knew she meant; day I do not know she gave aunt name. Whenever aunt used usually fretful, time went uncle would get softly, give peculiar look, go garden, where, I could, I followed, used talk, weed, train flowers; often aunt would pounce upon order sit still keep mischief I could. I glad uncle decided send school, I used go one neighbourhood, I good deal away home, uncle said I call his house now; school garden places I happiest days. "Yes, boy," said uncle, "I like call home, though aunt pretends she does not like it, she does, know, Nat; must not mind her bit cross, Nat. It is not temper, know, it is weakness. It is her digestion's bad, she is sufferer, that is she is. She is wonderfully fond you, Nat." I remember thinking she show it. "And must try get on, Nat, get lots learning," he would often say garden. "You will not poor grow up, poor mother left nice bit money, might lose that, Nat, boy; nobody could steal knowledge, and-- ah, rascal, got you, I?" This last great snail he raked among tender plants half eaten away. "Yes, Nat, get knowledge work hard books." But somehow I did not get well boys, I cared little rough games. I strong enough age, I preferred getting Clapham Common half-holidays, look lizards furze, catch bright-coloured sticklebacks ponds, else lie bank one trees, watch efts coming top make little bubble go again, waving bodies purple orange gay crests sometimes along backs spring. When I used lie thinking, I seem Clapham Common, far away banks huge lake foreign land efts lizards, crocodiles; big worms I sometimes found away holes wet weather became serpents moist jungle. Of course I got ideas books, great trouble I found one day playing tiger-hunting garden home Buzzy, aunt's great tabby tom-cat; pretending Nap lion African desert. But I will tell chapter itself, matters good deal alteration mode life. CHAPTER TWO. FIRST THOUGHTS OF HUNTING. As I told you, uncle children, great house Streatham always quiet. In fact one aunt's strict injunctions she disturbed noise mine. But aunt her pets--Buzzy, Nap. Buzzy largest striped tom-cat, I think, I ever saw, much aunt's annoyance he became fond me, much he saw going garden he would leap aunt's lap, she fond nursing him, stroking his back, beginning his head ending drawing his tail right her hand; Buzzy like, he would lie swear, trying every get free, held softly whipped submission. Buzzy decidedly objected nursed, soon he could get free he would rush garden, he would go bounding along, arching his back, setting fur upon his tail. Every he would hide clump, thence charge me, I ran him, away he would rush tree trunk, crouch branch glowing eyes, tearing his claws bark tremendous state excitement, ready bound again, race till he tired, I stoop say, "Come on," he would leap back perch upon shoulder, purring softly I carried round grounds. I used good fun, too, Nap, aunt out; she jealous her favourite's liking last I never used game Nap she home. Buzzy could come play quietly, Nap always got excited, lolling his tongue yelping barking delight he tore round me, pretending bite worry me, rolling over, tumbling head heels he capered bounded about. I think Nap ugliest dog I ever saw, he one dirty white French poodles, aunt used clipped, look like lion, she said, washed hot soap water every week. Nothing pleased Nap better go garden me, I got sad trouble once. "Look him, Joseph," aunt would say, "it is done purpose annoy me. Beautifully washed he yesterday, look his curly mane earth, bits straw dead leaves sticking it. If do not send boy away boarding-school I will not stay house." Then uncle would look troubled, take his room, he kept his books garden seeds. "You must not it, Nat, boy, indeed must not. You see annoys aunt." "I did not think I harm, uncle," I protested. "Nap jumped window, leaped he wanted game, I raced round garden him." "You did not rub earth dead leaves his coat then, Nat?" said uncle. "Oh no!" I said; "he throws his side pushes along, rubs his head ground, sometimes one side, sometimes other. I think it is he got f--" "Shush! Hush! dear boy," cried uncle, clapping his hand lips. "If aunt moment thought insects dog, she would ill." "But I am sure his coat, uncle," I said, "for watch he is lying hearth-rug to-night, every he jumps snaps them, bites place." "Shush! yes, boy," he whispered; "but do not talk it. Your aunt particular. It is secret us." I could not help smiling him, moment two he smiled me, patted shoulder. "Do not anything annoy aunt, boy," he said; "I would not play Nap I you." "I will try to, uncle," I said; "but he come coax play sometimes." "H'm! yes," said uncle thoughtfully, "and good, poor dog. He eats much, gets fat want exercise. Suppose play aunt goes walk." "Very well, uncle," I said, he shook hands me, gave half crown. I could not help it, I obliged spend half-crown something I wanting weeks. It large crossbow hung toy-shop window Streatham, bow attracted attention every time I went out. To boys crossbow would crossbow, meant travels imagination world. I saw shooting apples boys' heads, transfixing eagles flight, slaying wild beasts, bringing home endless trophies chase, first opportunity I shop, face glowing excitement delight I bought took home crossbow. "Hallo, Nat!" said Uncle Joseph. "Why, what is that--a crossbow?" "Yes, uncle; is not beauty?" I cried excitedly. "Well, yes, boy," he said; "but, but--how aunt? Suppose break window that, eh? What do?" "But I will not shoot direction, uncle," I promised. "Or shoot Jane's Cook's eye? It would dreadful, boy." "Oh, yes, uncle," I cried; "but I careful, perhaps I may shoot birds steal cherries." "Ah! yes, boy, might," he said rubbing his hands softly. "My best bigarreaus. Those birds terrible nuisance, Nat, are. You will careful, though?" "Yes, I will careful, uncle," I said; he went away nodding smiling, I went Clapham Common try bow short thick arrows supplied therewith. It glorious. At every twang away flew arrow piece tobacco-pipe I used instead; last, losing one shaft short turf, I found beside big pond far side, one reputation full great carp eels. My idea shoot fish, none visible shoot I content trying hit gliding spiders surface pieces tobacco-pipe long lasted, I dared waste another arrow, mind full adventures foreign countries I walked home. The next afternoon aunt went out, I took bow garden, leaving uncle enjoying his pipe. I busy morning, holiday time, making fresh arrows purpose I view, and, humane, I made heads cutting tops old kid gloves, ramming finger-ends full cotton-wool, tying thin deal arrows, bolt head like little soft leather ball. "Those cannot hurt him," I said myself; taking dozen bolts belt I went garden, Buzzy heels, good tiger-hunt. For next half-hour Streatham nowhere, old-fashioned garden fruit-trees become changed wild jungle, gigantic tiger kept charging, whose doom I fixed. Shot shot I monster--once bounded fork tree, another time stealing waving reeds, represented asparagus bed. Later on, much creeping stalking, tiger stalking well springing again, never getting quite home, I shot lurking beside great lake, represented tank. Here striped sides plainly visible, and, going hands knees, I crept along two rows terrible thorny trees bore sweet juicy berries season, wildest nature now, till I could get good aim monster's shoulder, see soft lithe tail twining writhing like snake. I crept on, full excitement, leafy plant I refused cabbage longer intercepted view. Then lying flat upon chest I fitted arrow bow, cautiously taking aim, telling I missed I seized monster, slight sound I made caused spring up, presenting striped flank target gazed there. Play was, intensely real me; moments I full excitement I distant land peril life. Then, long careful aim, twang went bow, intense delight soft-headed arrow struck monster full flank, making bound couple feet pounce upon bolt, canter full speed towards dense thicket scarlet-runners. "Victory, victory!" I cried excitedly; "wounded, wounded!" I set chase, approaching cautiously preparing bow again, I read tiger dangerous throes death. I forget I called scarlet-runner thicket, eastern name, drawing nearer I found opportunity another shot, missed. Away bounded Buzzy, evidently enjoying fun, I him, find bay beneath currant bush. I dozen yards away central path, and, course, full view upper windows house; I noted fact then, I far gone romance situation I daresay I called house rajah's palace. As I forgotten existence excitement chase. "This time, monster, thou shalt die," I cried, I fired, making Buzzy leap path, sight amongst cabbages. "Hurray! hurray!" I shouted, waving crossbow head, "the monster slain! monster slain!" There piercing shriek behind me, I turned, bow hand, find face face aunt. CHAPTER THREE. HOW I HUNTED THE LION IN NO-MAN'S-LAND AND WHAT FOLLOWED. My aunt's cry brought Uncle Joseph terrible state excitement, long chase Buzzy caught she could made believe he received mortal wound. And tremendous chase was, Uncle Joseph I tried circumvent cat, he threw fun hunt dodged us, running trees like squirrel, leaping his tail swollen four times usual size, going beds graceful bounds, till Uncle Joseph sat pant wipe his face I continued chase; vain. Sometimes I nearly caught cat, he would I made spring seize him, Aunt Sophia's tender appeals "poor Buzzy then," "my poor pet then," fell upon ears refused hear her. "Oh stupid I am!" I said myself. "Oh, Buzzy, bad give chase. Come here, sir, directly;" I stooped down. It required result, Buzzy leaped wall he scrambled, jumped back, settled comfortably his fore-paws shoulder, began purr satisfaction. "I glad, boy," said Uncle Joseph, "so glad caught him; hurt much?" "He is not hurt all, uncle," I said. "It play." "But aunt agony, boy. Here, let take cat her." He stretched his hands take cat shoulder, Buzzy's eyes dilated he began swear, making uncle start back, he dreaded scratch anything rose thorn, he mind. "Would mind taking aunt, Natty, boy?" he said. "No, uncle, you will please come too," I said. "Do not let aunt scold me, uncle; I am sorry, play." "I will come you, Nat," he said, shaking his head; "but I ought let bow, I am afraid she want burnt." "Will she cross?" I said. "I am afraid so, boy." And she really was. "Oh wicked, wicked boy," she cried I came up; "what doing?" "Only playing tiger-hunting, aunt," I said. "With poor darling Buzzy! Come mistress then, Buzzy," she cried pityingly. "Did wicked, cruel boy--oh dear!" _Wur-r-you are! spit, spit_! That Buzzy's reply his mistress's attempt take shoulder, he made attempt scratch. "And he used gentle lamb," cried aunt. "You wicked, wicked boy, must hurt darling terribly make angry his mistress he loves." I protested I not, use, I great disgrace days; Aunt Sophia forgot confiscate crossbow. The scolding I received ought effect upon me, not; week afterwards I disgrace, fault, difference, fancy garden become South African desert, Nap lion I engaged hunting. I harm, I sure, great deal good, exercise; way he entered sport delighted me. He charged dashed I fled; I hid behind trees shoot he seized arrows, hit him, worried fiercely; whenever missed him, place dashing he would run arrows bring his mouth he thought I hiding. I do not think Nap sense dogs general, he would often escape aunt I came home school, run big cupboard I kept treasures, raise upon his hind-legs, tear door till I opened took crossbow, he would frisk round round highest state delight, running garden, dashing back, running again, entering spirit game much pleasure I did. But fun got crossbow gets wearisome time, especially find spite great deal practice hard hit anything small. The time glided on, I happy still uncle; somehow Aunt Sophia seemed take quite dislike me; matter I tried right, follow uncle's wishes, I always trouble something another. One summer Uncle Joseph bought book butterflies, coloured plates, interested I began collecting next day, captured large cabbage butterfly. No great rarity this, beginning; pinning well I could I began think cabinet, collecting-boxes, net, packet entomological pins. I tell Uncle Joseph wants he eager help me. "Collecting-boxes, Nat?" he said, rubbing his hands softly; "why, I used use pill-boxes I boy: lots up-stairs." He hunted dozen afternoon, supplied old drawer piece camphor, entering matter much zest I myself. Then he obtained old green gauze veil aunt, set work tool-house make net, completion necessity he proposed go next afternoon far Clapham Common capture insects. He go me, aunt wanted hold skeins wool her wind, he made disappointment evening sitting I pinned far rare captures, taking great pleasure holding pins me, praising he called cleverness cutting pieces card. I know anything till came quite surprise, smuggled house aunt know, Jane, according uncle's orders, carrying bedroom. It large butterfly-case, made open two halves like backgammon board; this, soon dry, I used pin specimens, examining delight, never seeming weary noting various markings, finding names, numbering them, keeping proper titles book I purpose. I confine butterflies, caught moths beetles, dragon-flies edges ponds Clapham Common, longing go farther afield, often obtaining chance. Then, I began find specimens scarce, I set collecting things seemed interesting, last, visit paid aunt friends, Uncle Joseph took British Museum see butterflies there, so, he said, I might pick hints managing collection. That visit turned enthusiast, returned I hours feasting eyes upon stuffed birds noting wondrous colours scale-like feathers. I could think scarcely anything else, talk nothing else afterwards days; nothing would I must begin collect birds prepare stuff myself. "You would not mind, would you, uncle?" I said. "Mind? No, boy," he said, rubbing his hands softly; "I like it; think could stuff bird?" "Not first," I said thoughtfully; "but I try." "To sure, Nat," he cried smiling; "nothing like trying, boy; would begin?" This set thinking. "I do not know, uncle," I said last, "but looks easy." "Ha! ha! ha! Nat; lots things," he cried, laughing; "but sometimes turn hard." "I know," I said suddenly. "I know," I said, "I could find it." "Have lessons, eh?" he said. "No, uncle." "How would manage then, Nat?" "Buy stuffed bird, uncle, pull pieces, see done." "To sure, Nat," he cried; "to sure, boy. That is way; stop moment; would put together again?" "Oh! I think I could, uncle," I said; "I am nearly sure I could. How could I get one try with?" "Why, might buy one somewhere," he said thoughtfully; "for I do not think they would lend us one British Museum; I tell what, Nat," he cried: "I have got it." "Have you, uncle?" "To sure, boy. There is aunt's old parrot died stuffed. Do not know?" I shook head. "It put somewhere up-stairs lumber-room, aunt forgotten it. You might try that." "And I would stuff I found it, uncle," I said. "To sure, boy," said uncle, thoughtfully; "I wonder whether aunt would want Buzzy Nap stuffed die?" "She would sure to; aunt fond them," I said. "Why, uncle, I might able myself." "Think so?" he said thoughtfully. "Why, would make her pleased, boy." But neither Buzzy Nap showed slightest intention dying stuffed, I learn art I could attempt anything kind. CHAPTER FOUR. THE REMAINS OF POOR POLLY. The first opportunity, uncle took lumber-room, attic aunt kept key; here, quite hunt amongst old portmanteaux, broken chairs, dusty tables, bird-cages, wrecked kennels, cornice-poles, black-looking pictures, dozens odds ends, came dark corner upon remains one aunt's earliest pets. It stuffed figure grey parrot stood beneath glass shade, shade broken, poor Polly, looked she moulting ever since she fixed upon her present perch, her head partly torn her shoulders. "Here she is," said uncle. "Poor old Polly! What bird she screech! She never liked me, Nat, used call _wretch_, plain could say yourself. It wicked me, I dare say, Nat, I glad she died, aunt sorry she cried week." "But she never pretty bird, uncle," I said, holding stuffed creature light. "No, boy, never, she used pull her feathers she passion, call people _wretch_. She bit aunt's nose once. But think do?" "Oh yes, uncle," I said; "but may I pull pieces?" "Well, yes, boy, I think so," he said dreamily. "You could not spoil it, could you?" "Why, spoiled already, Uncle Joe," I said. "Yes, boy, is; quite spoiled. I think I will risk it, Nat." "But aunt would cross, uncle, had not I better leave it?" I said. "If did not take it, Nat, she would never see again, would lie moulder away. I think better take it, boy." I eager begin I hesitated more, took bird tool-house, I could make aunt called "a mess" without scolded, uncle put his smoking-cap, lit his pipe, brought high stool sit upon watch make first attempt mastering mystery. The first thing take Polly her perch, piece twig covered moss, glued on, came away hands, I found bird kept upright means wires ran her legs wound twig. Uncle smoked away solemnly could be, I went on, he seemed admiring earnestness. "There is wire legs, uncle," I cried, I felt bird. "Oh! there?" he said, condescendingly. "Yes, uncle, two pieces wings." "You do not say so, Nat!" "Yes, uncle, another bit runs right body head tail; and--yes--no--yes--no--ah, I have found tail spread." "Have you, Nat?" he cried, letting his pipe out, he full interest. "Yes, uncle; there is thin wire threaded tail feathers, beads." "Why, boy are!" he cried, wonderingly. "Oh, it is easy enough find out, uncle," I said, colouring. "Now let us see what is inside." "Think there is anything inside, Natty, boy?" "Oh yes, uncle," I said; "it is full something. Why, it is tow." "Toe, boy!" he said seriously, "parrot's toe?" "T-o-w. Tow, uncle, use clean lamps. I stuff bird, uncle, I know." "Think can, Natty?" "Yes, sure," I said confidently. "Why, look here, it is easy make ball tow shape egg body, push wires body, wings, legs; no, stop moment, seem fastened in. Yes, are, I know I it." Uncle Joe held his pipe his mouth his teeth rubbed his hands satisfaction, he pleased imagined success I was, he looked I pulled stuffing skin, placing wings here, legs there, tail me, head white-irised glass eye stuck upon nail wall bench. "I feel sure be, uncle, I could stuff one." "Ha! ha! ha!" he laughed. "_Wretch! wretch! wretch_! That is Polly would say she could speak. See you have pulled her pieces." I looked he spoke, head queer glass eyes seeming stare hard me, mess skin feathers bench. "Well, I pulled her pieces, have not I, uncle?" I said. "That have, boy," he said, chuckling, he thought good fun. "But I learned stuff bird, uncle," I said triumphantly. "And going stuff Polly again?" he asked, gazing ragged feathers skin. I looked quite guiltily. "I--I do not think I could put one together again, uncle," I said. "You see ragged torn I touched it, feathers coming place. But I could fresh one. You see there is nothing skin. All feathers falling away." "Yes," said uncle, "and I know--" "Know what, uncle?" "Why, skin stuff preserve it, you will get chemist's." "Yes, uncle." "And I do not know, Natty," he said, "but I think might try put poor old Polly together again, I do not feel quite comfortable her; made her dreadful mess." "Yes, I have, indeed, uncle," I said dolefully, eagerness beginning evaporate. "And aunt fond her, boy, she would not like she knew." "But I am afraid I could not put her together now, uncle;" I began tremble, uncle leaped his stool, broke his pipe: aunt's well-known step gravel, directly heard her cry: "Joseph! Nathaniel! What doing?" And I knew I confess. CHAPTER FIVE. HOW MY UNCLE AND I PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY TOGETHER AGAIN. My uncle stood bravely Aunt Sophia entered tool-house exclamation surprise. For minutes she could understand about. "Feathers--a bird--a parrot!" she exclaimed last. "Why, like poor Polly." I looked guiltily uncle speak, he made signal silent. "Yes, dear," he faltered, "it--it poor Polly. We--we found her lumber-room--all ruins, dear, we--we examining her." "I do not believe it," said aunt sharply. "That mischievous boy his tricks again." "I assure you, dear," cried uncle, "I well. I helped him. Nat wants understand bird-stuffing, museum came home." "Well, course did," said aunt tartly; "do suppose I thought stopped live museum?" "No, dear, course not," said uncle, laughing feebly. "We studying art taxidermy, dear, Nat I." He added quite importantly, putting his eyeglasses nodding approval support. "Bless man! Taxi what?" cried aunt, seemed fascinated Polly's eyes; she began softly scratch feathers back head. "Taxi-dermy," said uncle, "and--and, dear, I would not scratch Polly's head I you; skins preserved poison." "Bless heart!" exclaimed aunt, snatching back her hand; holding finger me: "Wipe that, Nat." I took handkerchief, dipped corner watering-pot, carefully wiped finger clear anything might sticking it, though, hands lately contact Polly's skin, I do not believe I much good; satisfied aunt, turned Uncle Joe. "Now then, Joseph; say?" "Taxi-dermy, dear," he said importantly; "the art preserving mounting skins dead animals." "And nice mess you will make, I dare say," cried aunt. "But indoors, dear. We shall careful. You see Polly good deal knocked about. Your large black box fallen right upon her, her head off, dear. The glass shade shivers." "Poor Polly, yes," said aunt, "I her put moths her feathers. Well, mind this, I shall expect Natty repair her nicely; must buy new glass shade, Joseph. Ah, precious!" This Nap, who, reply her tender speech, made three four bounds get me, aunt caught ear held skin his face pulled sidewise, he seemed winking he lolled his thin red tongue, uttered low whine. "But mind this, I mess made indoors." As she spoke aunt stooped took Nap her arms, soiling her handsome silk dress good deal dog's dirty feet. Then she walked away saying endearing things Nap, whined struggled get away ungrateful fashion; uncle took his glasses, drew long breath, said he wiped his face his red silk handkerchief: "I afraid she going cross, boy. She is good woman, dear aunt, boy, I am proud her; she upset she cross." "I fidge, uncle," I said laughing. "So I, Nat, I. But do not laugh, boy. It serious thing smiles. It always puts dreadful perspiration, Nat, I do not like angry too. Never angry woman grow up, Nat, boy; women, see, belong weaker sex." "Yes, uncle," I said wonderingly; he began beam smile again, rubbed his hands together softly he looked work. "But put Polly together again, Nat," he said last. "Put her together again, uncle!" I said dismay. "Why, it is like Humpty Dumpty sat wall--all king's horses king's men--" "Could not put Humpty Dumpty together again," said uncle quite seriously. "But must put Polly together again, Natty. There is aunt, know." "Yes, uncle, there is Aunt Sophia," I said ruefully; "but feathers skin, skin's pieces. I am afraid she never look decent, try I may." My uncle rubbed his head softly. "It look would terrible job, Nat," he said; "but must done, I am afraid made her look well she found her, aunt would not satisfied." "I am sure I could not make her look well she then, uncle," I replied despairingly; "but I will try." "Yes, do, boy. That is right, try. And look here, Nat--I will help you." I glad hear Uncle Joseph say that, though I think he would able help much; lose time began think matter out, uncle said _yes_ I proposed do, his idea helping me; he said I drove nails he clinched them. After bit thinking I came conclusion I since learned best one I could arrived at, proper thing fix Polly's wire legs neatly made body I could, stick feathers proper places. But body made of? Clay putty could easily moulded shape, would heavy. Papier-mache would thing, I know make it, last I decided cut body piece wood. "The thing, Nat," said uncle. "Stop minute, boy, till I have lit pipe, we will begin." I waited till uncle said he ready, begin, say, he went smoking I sawed piece wood I thought would do. I need tell task; laboriously I carved away day day piece wood pocket-knife, breaking one work; I mounted piece wood last wires, proceeded, help little glue-pot uncle bought purpose, stick Polly's feathers again. By way, I think I fastened her wings tin tacks. It very, long job; every stage uncle sat expressed his approval, every spare hour spent tool-house, I patiently worked away. I grew tired task, felt I must finish it, I often thought since splendid lesson proved. And I worked on, sticking little patches skin here, feathers there, I afraid making blunders would driven naturalist frantic, I sure patches feathers belonged breast stuck back, smooth back feathers ornamented Polly's breast. The head tolerably complete, allowed hang nail wall, seemed watch process putting together again; tail terrible, often made feel ready give despair. But uncle really help me, ever he saw heart tired he used say: "Suppose give bit, Nat, run." Then time came another try Polly used laugh say would another turn Humpty Dumpty. At last--and I do not know long took--the time come Polly's head cease staring ghastly one-eyed way her body, come crown edifice. I remember well. It bright, sunny half-holiday, I longing fishing, Humpty Dumpty incomplete fishing me, especially Aunt Sophia asking soon her pet finished. "Come along, Nat," said Uncle Joseph, "and we will soon finish it." I smiled rather sadly, I feel sanguine. I made glue-pot hot, however, set work, rearranging patch two feathers looked bad, I stared uncle he gazed me. I believe kind idea sort feather tippet hung Polly's head would act cloak hide imperfections plain. Certainly hopeful idea brain, though I feel sanguine. "Now then, boy, then," cried uncle, last I took Polly's head nail, he rubbed his hands excitement. "We shall last." I fancy I smell hot steaming glue I went day's work, I kept stirring thinking much I ought put bird's neck upon skull keep soiling making sticky feathers. It took consideration, dear Uncle Joe watched attentively I going perform wonderful operation. He even held his breath I began glue head, uttered low sigh relief I replaced brush pot. Then carefully I could I fixed head place, securing tightly driving long thin stocking-needle right skull wood. And was, result month's spare time labour, I drew back contemplate effort genius. I laugh I picture whole scene. The rough bench stood bird, wall hung garden tools, Uncle Joe his pipe one hand, his resting upon his knee he sat upon upturned tub gazing straight me, I seem see boyish self gazing task till I utterly broke misery vexation spirit, laying head upon arms crying like girl. For minutes Uncle Joe taken aback he sat breathing hard staring me. "Why, Nat--Nat, boy," he said last, he got tub stood patting shoulders. "What matter, boy; poorly?" "No--no--no," I sobbed. "It is horrid, horrid, horrid!" "What is horrid, Natty?" he said. "That dreadful bird. Oh, uncle," I cried passionately, "I knew I could not I began." "The bird? What! Humpty Dumpty? What! Polly? Why, boy, she is splendid, aunt so--" "She is not," I cried, flashing passion. "She is not like bird all. I know soft rounded smooth birds are; ever see horrid thing that? It is beast, uncle! It is regular guy! It is a--oh, oh!" In rage disappointment miserable result much hard work I tore lump feathered wood bench, dashed upon ground, stamped upon it. Then passion seemed flash away quickly come, I stood staring Uncle Joe Uncle Joe stared me. CHAPTER SIX. A PIECE OF DECEIT THAT WAS NOT CARRIED OUT. For minutes neither us spoke. Uncle Joe seemed astounded completely taken his balance. He put his glasses took again. He laid his pipe rubbed his hands first his face his crimson silk handkerchief, ending taking his glasses rolling handkerchief, flipping afterwards bench amongst broken flower-pots. And time I felt prey bitterest remorse, I done something wicked I could never forgiven again. "Oh, uncle! dear Uncle Joe," I cried passionately. "I so--so sorry." "Sorry, Nat!" he said, taking outstretched hands, drawing his breast, holding patting back his hands. "Sorry, Nat! yes, that is I felt, boy. It pity, know." "Oh, no, Uncle Joe," I cried, looking work. "It horrible, I have ashamed every day." "Have you, Nat, boy?" he said. "Oh, yes, uncle, I kept hoping that--that somehow--somehow would come better." "That is I have hoping, boy," he said, "for try hard." "Yes, uncle, I tried very, hard, never come better." "No, boy, quite right; never come better, I hoped would put head." "So I, uncle, seemed make look ridiculous, was not bit like bird." "No, boy, was not bit like bird," he said weakly. "Then say capital, uncle?" I cried sharply. "Well, boy, because--because I--that is--I wanted encourage you, and," he cried confidently, "it capital you." "Oh, Uncle Joe, disgraceful, I do not know aunt would said." "I do not know she say now," said uncle ruefully, he gazed Humpty Dumpty's wreck, lay crushed dust. "I am afraid she will cross. You see I half told her would done to-day, I am afraid--" "Oh, uncle, tell her that?" I said reproachfully. "Well, boy, see she remonstrating little much, I am afraid I preparing her surprise." "And she will cross ever, uncle," I said, picking bird. "Yes, boy, she will cross ever. It is bad job, Nat, I do not like see show temper that." "I am sorry, Uncle Joe," I said humbly. "I did not mean fly like that. It is like Jem Boxhead school." "Does he fly tempers like that, Nat?" "Yes, uncle, _often_." "It is bad job, boy, I never saw anything kind you. It is not disease, temper is not, I think caught it. You could not catch bad temper, know, boy. But do not think, Natty, might still manage put Humpty Dumpty together again?" "No, uncle," I said, "it is impossible;" I know impossibility first, hours experience taught I engaged upon hopeless task. He took his crimson handkerchief, reseating upon tub began wiping his face hands more. "You have made hot, Natty," he said. "What done?" "I do not know, uncle," I said dolefully. "But cross me?" "Cross, boy? No. I thinking much like poor sister, dear mother, would go temper like sometimes boy girl." "Please, uncle," I said, laying hand upon his arm, "I will try hard go temper like that." "Yes, yes, do, boy," he said, taking hand his speaking affectionately. "Do not give way temper, boy, it is bad habit. But I am sorry, Nat, I am bit sorry, dear boy, see you have got spirit like poor mother. She different me, Nat. I never bit spirit, people always done pleased me." I could help thinking aunt then, I said nothing, Uncle Joe began parrot. "So think could put Humpty Dumpty together again, Nat?" "No, uncle," I said despairingly, "I am sure could not. It is much lost time." "There is plenty time use, Nat, things," he said dreamily, "but work, and--and, boy, aunt let us much, I am afraid I dare tell her failure." "Then what is done, uncle?" I said. "I am afraid, boy, must wicked deceitful." "Deceitful, uncle?" "Yes, boy, aunt never forgive us." "Why, mean, uncle?" I said. "I have thinking, boy, I might go somewhere buy grey parrot--one already stuffed. I dare face her without." I felt puzzled, strong belief upon going foolish thing. "Would not better go tell Aunt Sophia frankly accident, spoiled parrot, uncle?" "Yes, boy, much better," he said, "very much better; but--but I dare it, Nat, I dare it." I felt I like say, "I will it, uncle," I, too, shrank task, saved underhanded proceeding appearance aunt tool-house door. My unfortunate attempt restuffing poor Polly made less favourite ever Aunt Sophia, never let day pass without making unpleasant allusion condition there. My uncle assured I wise dependent upon them, mother's money gave ample interest education board, Aunt Sophia always seemed ignore fact, Uncle Joe's kindness I miserable indeed. The time slipped away, I grown tall strong boy fifteen; spite aunt's constant fault-finding I received sufficient encouragement Uncle Joe go natural history pursuits, collecting butterflies beetles, birds' eggs spring, stuffing many birds I could obtain. Some latter roughly done, I natural love various objects nature, I find birds I days, rough were, lifelike appearance. I ask uncle money buy books specimens forthcoming, I went arranging rearranging, making neatly written catalogue little museum tool-house, always helped Uncle Joe's encouragement. I suppose I strange boy, seeking companionship school-fellows little, aunt refused let visit me, let go homes. I driven thus, were, upon resources, somehow I find mine unhappy life; fact pleasant seem time came give I sorry leave it, felt ready settle aunt's constant fault-finding sake dear tender-hearted old Uncle Joe, broken completely spirit go. "But it is right, Nat, boy, quite right," he said, "and would spoiled stayed here. It time began think growing man, I hope pray you will grow one I proud." CHAPTER SEVEN. THE RETURN OF THE WANDERER. One day I came home school I surprised find tall dark gentleman drawing-room uncle aunt. He dark he looked first foreigner, his dark keen eyes long black beard grizzled white hairs made different Uncle Joseph I could help comparing one other. "This Master Nathaniel, I suppose," said stranger quick sharp way, he accustomed order people about. "Yes, that is Joseph's nephew," said aunt tartly, "and nice boy he is." "You mean nasty one," I said myself, I coloured up, "but need not told stranger." "Yes," said Uncle Joseph, "he nice boy, Richard, I am proud him." My aunt gave loud sniff. "Suppose shake hands then, Nathaniel," said stranger, I immediately guessed Aunt Sophia's brother Richard, learned man doctor, I heard. He seemed order shake hands him, I went held mine, gazing full his dark eyes, wondering much he knew. "Well done, youngster," he said, giving hand squeeze hurt ever so, I would flinch. "I like see boy able look one full face." "Oh! he impudence enough anything," said aunt. "Oh! he?" said visitor smiling. "Well, I would rather see boy impudent milksop." "Nat never impudent me," said uncle, speaking way made aunt stare. "I see--I see," said visitor. "You never fond boys, Sophy." "No, indeed," said aunt. "Cats dogs always way," said visitor. "Get out!" This Nap, smelling time, he gave rough kick dog yelped out, moment temper I promised uncle keep flashed forth again, I caught Nap protect him, flushing scarlet-- "Do not kick dog," I said sharply. I have often thought since aunt ought pleased taking part old friend her favourite, she turned upon quickly. "Leave room, sir, directly. How dare you!" she cried. "To dare speak visitor like that!" I go disgrace, I closed door I saw visitor laughing showing his white teeth. "I shall hate him," I said myself, I put hands pockets began wander garden; I hardly gone fro half dozen times I heard voices, I creep round side path get indoors way Mr Richard Burnett caught sight me, shouted come. I went looking hurt ill-used he coming path Uncle Joe; he clapped shoulder, swung round, keeping his arm half round neck, walked them, I listened he kept telling Uncle Joseph he been. "Five years South America, wandering away civilisation, long time, Joe; I shall soon again." I pricked ears. "Back South America, Dick?" "No, dear boy, I shall go another direction time." "Where shall go time, sir?" I said eagerly. "Eh? shall I go, squire?" he said sharply. "Right away Borneo New Guinea, wherever I likely collect specimens find new varieties." "Do collect, sir?" I said excitedly. "To sure I do, boy. Do you?" he added smile. "Yes, sir, I can." "Oh yes! he quite wonderful collection tool-house, Richard. Come see." Our visitor smiled contemptuous way I coloured again, felt I liked cry, "You shall not see make fun work." But time tool-house door, inside cabinet full drawers uncle let carpenter make me, cases boxes, birds I stuffed. In fact time, couple years collecting, tools ousted hang another she would, tool-house pretty well taken lumber. "Why, hallo!" cried visitor; "who stuffed birds?" I answered modestly enough I. "And what is drawers, eh?" he said, pulling sharply one other, opening cases. "Nat's collections," said uncle proudly. "Here is his catalogue." "Neatly written out--numbered--Latin names," he said, half himself. "Why, hallo, young fellow, I do not wonder Aunt Sophia says bad character." "But he is not, Dick," said Uncle Joe warmly; "he is good lad, Sophy do not mean she says." "She used tell I come good old days I began make mess home, Joe," he said merrily. "Why, Nat, boy, I must good friends. You would like come see collection, eh?" "Will you--will show me, sir?" I said, catching excitement sleeve. "Well, I do not know," he said drily; "you looked daggers I kicked aunt's pet." "I could not help it, sir," I said; "Nap always good friends I did not like see hurt." "Then I beg Nap's pardon," he said smiling. "I thought he useless pet; he good friend he better dog I thought for." "He would splendid dog hunt with, sir, he chance." "Would he? Well, I am glad it, shall come see collection, help catalogue arrange like. Here, hi! stop minute: going?" "Only fetch cap, sir," I said excitedly, idea seeing collections man five years South America seemed set fire. "Plenty time yet, boy," he said, showing white teeth pleasant smile; "they docks Southampton, board ship. Wait bit, shall see all." CHAPTER EIGHT. I FIND MYSELF A BROTHER NATURALIST. I stood looking hard visitor, Doctor Burnett, thought different he Aunt Sophia. Only little before, I felt I must hate behaving badly Nap, talking cold, contemptuous way. It seemed he would join Aunt Sophia making uncomfortable, I thought would much pleasanter he stayed away. But now, I stood watching him, he becoming quite hero eyes, he abroad seeing wonders world, he suddenly shown liking me, his whole manner changed. When he spoken house pooh-poohing sort fashion, I stupid troublesome boy, much way, he wondered his sister brother-in-law's keeping upon premises; change wonderful. The cold distant manner gone, he began talk he known life. "Shall go round garden again, Dick?" said uncle, standing nodding smiling me, evidently feeling proud his brother-in-law take much notice collection. "No," said visitor sharply. "There, get pipe, Joe, sit look I go Nat's collection. We naturalists always compare notes--eh, Nat?" I turned scarlet excitement pleasure, Uncle Joseph rubbed his hands, beaming satisfaction, proceeded take his long clay pipe hung upon two nails wall, his little tobacco jar niche rafters. "That is I often here, Dick," he said; "I sit smoke give advice--when asked, Nat goes his stuffing preserving." "Then now, may sit give advice--when asked," said visitor smiling, "while Nat I compare notes. Who taught stuff birds, Nat?" "I--I taught myself, sir," I replied. "Taught yourself?" he said, pinching one birds--a starling I bought penny man gun. "Yes, sir; I pulled Polly pieces." "You what?" he cried, bursting roar laughter. "Why, Polly--one maids?" "Oh no, sir! Aunt Sophy's stuffed parrot." "Well, really, Nat," he said, laughing heartily, "you are strangest boy I ever met." "Am I, sir?" I said, feeling little chilled again, he seemed laughing unpleasantly me. "That are, Nat; I like strange boys. So pulled Polly pieces, eh? And found naturalists put wires, eh?" "Yes, sir." "And preserve skins?" "With arsenical soap, sir." "That is right; I." "But it is dangerous stuff, sir," I said eagerly. "Not properly used, boy," he said, taking bird bird examining carefully. "A fire dangerous thing thrust hand it, Uncle Joe's razors dangerous things properly used. You see I do not trouble much," he added smiling. "No, indeed, sir," I said, I glanced his long beard. "I do not hot water shaving brought me, Nat, I am sea, boy, jungle. It is rough work there." "But must nice, sir," I said eagerly. "Very, boy, lie sleep beneath tree, hungry could eat boots, knowing whether enemy attacks morning wild beast, poisonous serpent, deadly fever." "But must exciting, sir," I cried. "Very, boy," he said drily. "Yes: bird's rough, I like shape. There is nature it--at least much get imitation. Look, Joe, there is soft roundness bird. It looks alive. Some best bird-stuffers notion bird like real life baby. What made put tomtit position, Nat?" he said, turning sharply me. "That?--that is hang legs picking buds, sir," I said nervously, I quite startled his quick, sudden way. "To sure is, Nat, boy. That is quite right. Always take nature model, imitate her closely can. Some stuffed birds British Museum used drive rage. Glad see true ring you, boy." I hardly knew he meant "true ring", evidently meant kindly, I felt hotter ever; spirits rose I saw pleased Uncle Joe was. "You stuff birds, then, sir?" I said, pause, visitor made busy examining everything I had. "Well, yes, Nat, fashion. I am clever it, I never practise mounting. I make skins." "Make skins, sir?" "Yes, boy. Do not see I wild place shooting collecting, every scrap luggage becomes burden." "Yes, sir; course," I said, nodding head sagely, "especially roads good." "Roads, boy," he said laughing; "the rivers streams roads places I travel through. Then, course, I cannot use wires tow distend birds, make call skins. That say, preparing skin, done tie long bones together, fill bird kind wild cotton, press head back body means tiny paper cone sugar-paper, put band round wings, dry skin sun." "Yes, I know, sir," I cried eagerly; "and pin paper round bird tiny bamboo skewer, put another piece bamboo head tail." "Why, know?" he said wonderingly. "Oh! Nat knows deal," said Uncle Joe, chuckling. "We are stupid people think, Dick, even stay home." "I have got skin two, sir," I said, "and made like that." As I spoke I took two skins old cigar-box. "Oh! I see," he said, he took gently smoothed feathers greatest care. "Where get these, Nat?" "I bought pocket-money Oxford Street, sir," I said, Uncle Joe, seen them, leaned forward. "And know are, boy?" said visitor. "No, sir; I books pictures in, man sold know. Can tell me, sir?" "Yes, Nat, I think so," he said quietly. "This pretty dark bird black white crimson plumage rain-bird--the blue-billed gaper; softly-feathered fellow bristles side his bill trogon." "A trogon, sir?" "Yes, Nat, trogon; little bamboo skewers tell directly birds came somewhere East." I looked wonderingly. "Yes, Nat," he continued, "from East, bamboo used endless purposes. It hard, bear sharp point, abundant people seem end use make it." "And seen birds like alive, sir?" "No, Nat, I hope long. That blue-billed gaper probably came Malacca, trogon too. See beautifully wings pencilled, bright cinnamon back feathers contrasts bright crimson breast. We plenty trogons West; gorgeous fellows, tails yard long, resplendent golden metallic green." "And humming-birds, sir?" "Thousands, boy; darting air like living gems. The specimens brought home beautiful, nothing compared fairy-like little creatures, full life action, sun flashing plumage." "And humming-birds, sir, East?" I cried, feeling mouth grow dry excitement interest. "No, boy; tribe tiny birds know sun-birds, almost beautiful plumage, similar habit. I hope make long study ways, get good collection. I know nothing, however, attractive man loves nature lie beneath great plant convolvulus, trumpet-shaped blossom, watch humming-birds flashing fro sunlight. Their scale-like feathers throat head reflect sun rays like many gems, colours gorgeous possible conceive. But there, I tire you. Why, Joe, pipe's out!" "Please go on, sir," I said hoarse whisper, for, he spoke, I felt far away wondrous foreign land, lying beneath trumpet-flowered tree plant, gazing brilliant little creatures he described. "Do like hear things, then?" he said smiling. "Oh! much, sir!" I cried; he went on. "I believe capture insects certain times, rule lovely little birds live upon honey suck nectaries trumpet-shaped blossoms; bills long thin reach right end. Some little creatures make quite humming noise wings, darting like large fly seem stop midway air, apparently motionless, wings beating fast almost invisible. Sometimes one stop like front beautiful flower, may see hang suspended air, thrusts long bill drinks sweet honey forms food." "And shoot little things, sir?" I asked. "Oh, yes, boy; easy enough shoot them," he replied. "The difficulty bring without hurting plumage, extremely delicate. The Indians shoot blow-pipe pellets get good specimens; one always Indians; hot climates bird must skinned directly, I generally trust get specimens." "With blow-pipe, sir?" "No, Nat; I tried, I never got clever it. One wants begin young manage blow-pipe well. I always shot humming-birds gun." "And shot, sir?" "Not always, Nat. I brought disturbance air wad gun. At times I used sand, places I sand I used water." "Water!" I exclaimed. "Yes, good purpose, Nat. A little poured barrel gun powder made safe couple wads, driven fine cutting spray, secured many lovely specimen plumage unhurt." "But do not seem rather cruel shoot lovely creatures, Dick?" said Uncle Joe apologetic tone. "Well, yes, struck light now," said visitor; "but I working entirely scientific views, spread knowledge beautiful occupants world, I see harm. Besides, I never wantonly destroy life. And then, look here, clear Joe, come think things find almost invariably bird animal kill passed life killing things upon lives." "Ye-es," said Uncle Joe, "I suppose has." "You would not like shoot blackbird, perhaps?" "Well, I do not know," said Uncle Joe. "They wickedest thieves ever entered garden; are not they, Nat?" "Yes, uncle, nuisance," I said. "Well, suppose killed blackbird, Joe," continued visitor; "he spent half his time killing slugs snails, lugging poor unfortunate worms holes; seems slug worm likely enjoy life greedy blackbird, people protect he orange bill sings sweetly spring." "Ye-es," said uncle, looking he terribly puzzled, I sat drinking every word visitor said, feeling I never heard one talk like that. "For part," continued visitor, "I never destroy life wantonly; you, young man, may take piece good advice--never kill sake killing. Let work necessity--for food, specimen, protection, never sport. I do not like word, Nat; much cruelty called sport." "But would not kill lions tigers, sir?" I said. "Most decidedly, boy. That struggle life. I would sooner kill thousand tigers, Nat, one kill me," he said laughing; "and part--" "Joseph, I am ashamed you. Nathaniel, doing, naughty boy," cried aunt, appearing door. "It really disgraceful, Joseph, come sit smoke; you, Nathaniel, mean, sir, dragging un--, I mean visitor, nasty, untidy place, pestering rubbish?" "Oh, Nathaniel's doing, Sophy," said visitor smiling, he rose drew aunt's arm his, "but mine; I have making boy show his treasures. There, come along I good long chat now. Nat, boy, I shall not forget said." CHAPTER NINE. UNCLE DICK'S BOXES. "I am afraid we have made aunt cross, Nat, boy," said Uncle Joe, rubbing his hands softly, looking perplexed troubled. "Do think, Nat, I leading wrong?" "I hope not, uncle," I said, "and I do not think so, nice toolshed, enjoyed so." "Yes, boy, have, much, indeed, I am afraid aunt never forgave us putting Humpty Dumpty together again." "But, uncle," I said, "is not unreasonable Aunt Sophia expect us king's horses king's men could do?" He looked minutes without speaking, he began smile slightly, little little more, till, instead looking dreadfully serious, his face happy could be. Then he began laugh heartily, I laughed too, till tears eyes. "Of--of course was, Nat," he cried, chuckling coughing together. "We could not king's horses king's men did not manage, Nat, and--yes, dear, we are coming." Uncle Joe jumped went tool-house, aunt's voice could heard telling us come in. "Hush!" he whispered, finger his lips. "Make haste in, Nat, run room wash hands." I followed in, somehow, whenever Doctor Burnett room, aunt seem cross, especially her brother took good deal notice me, kept asking questions. I soon found, great delight, he going stay us till he started Singapore, place whose name somehow set thinking Chinese people Indian rajahs, all; rest one great mystery, I used lie bed night wonder sort place could be. Every day visitor grew less cool distant his ways, last aunt said pettishly: "Well, really, Richard, bad; third morning week kept boy away school saying wanted him. How expect his education get on?" "Get on?" said Doctor Burnett; "why, dear sister, he learning whole time he me; I will bound say he picked geography since he he time he school." "I do not know much that," said aunt snappishly. "Then I do," he said. "Let boy alone, he learning great deal; I shall want next week." "You would better take away school altogether," said aunt angrily. "Well, yes," said doctor quietly; "as near his holidays, he may well stop away rest half." "Richard!" cried aunt I sat pinching legs keep looking pleased. "He work hard helping collections, way here, I find, letter received morning. There great deal copying labelling, improve his writing, though he write fair round hand." "But neglecting his studies," cried aunt. "But he picking good deal Latin, I shall explain meaning words he writes them, and, besides, telling much I know natural history travels." "And become boy then?" cried aunt. "I turn idler, Richard." "Well, think I turned idler, Sophy," he said laughing, showing his white teeth, "all I say is, idling natural history travelling hard work." "But boy must run wild as--" "I did? There, say out, Sophy," said her brother. "I do not mind, dear; people look upon everything understand idling." "I think I understand good boy," said aunt shortly. "Of course do," said doctor, "and think good help bit, Sophy. Come along, Nat, boy, back-room chests, must make ready, to-morrow." "Oh, Doctor Burnett," I cried soon alone. "Suppose call Uncle Richard future, boy," he said. "By by, get know better, Uncle Dick. Why once, eh?" "I--I should not like call that, sir," I said. "Why not?" "I--I hardly know, sir, seem clever know much." "Then shall Uncle Dick once," he said, laughing merrily; "for every day me, Nat, finding I clever think." So day always Uncle Dick, soon great chests arrived set work. I shall never forget great rough boxes made foreign wood, intense interest I watched carried upon backs stout railway vanmen set carefully large back-room. There twenty altogether, piled upon others building stones, till last men's book signed, money paid carriage, Uncle Joe, Uncle Dick, I sat alone staring chests wondering appearance. For battered, bruised, chipped away splinters, looked old indeed, though, uncle told me, one five years old, though might fifty. Every one painted upon large white letters: "Dr Burnett, FZS, London," I wondered FZS might mean. Then I noticed chests numbered, I longing intensely opened, Uncle Dick, I suppose I must call now, made start crying out: "Screw-driver!" I jumped ran Uncle Joe's tool-box big screw-driver, back short time, Uncle Dick laughing heartily he saw excitement. "Thank you, Nat, do," he said. "It nice handy to-morrow morning." "Ha--ha--ha!" he laughed directly after, he saw blank disappointed face. "Did think I going open cases to-day, Nat?" "I hope so, sir," I said stoutly. "Then I will," he cried, "for frank. Now then, shall be?" "I begin number one, sir," I said. "And will, Nat. Nothing like order. Look here, boy. Here book cataloguing." He showed large blank book ruled lines, turning I found headings different specimens placed. But I could look much book "our great traveller", Uncle Joe used call me, busy work screw-driver, taking great screws, one another, laying box. "Now, Nat," he said, "suppose going trouble I find half specimens destroyed, shall I do?" "I do not know, uncle," I said. "I know I do." "What, boy?" "Go try find more." "A good plan," he said laughing; "and means journeying ten twelve thousand miles, boy, seek more, becomes serious task." All he working away screws, till half loose enough go turning fingers, this, first two three, I till came last, uncle stopped pretended tight would turn. "Let try, uncle," I cried. "You? Nonsense! boy. There, I think shall give to-day." He burst laughing next moment doleful face, gave screw rapid twists; moments out, he took hold lid. "Ready?" he exclaimed. "Yes, quite ready," said Uncle Joe, nearly much excited I myself; lid lifted eagerly looked inside. There much see, looked like another lid, held place stout nails. These soon drawn though, second lid lifted, still nothing see cotton-wool, which, however, sent curious spicy smell, hot peppery, mixed camphor. Then treat began, Uncle Dick removed layers cotton-wool, birds lying closely packed, beautiful plumage we--that is, Uncle Joe I--uttered cry delight. I never seen anything beautiful, I thought, gorgeous colours birds me, seemed fresh bright different anything I seen museum, Uncle Dick taken care, I afterwards found, reject perfect skins; ready taken laid carefully upon boards he prepared purpose, I helped I kept asking questions till people would answered out. Uncle Dick, however, encouraged go questioning him, I quickly picked names good many birds. Now would magnificent macaw blue scarlet. Then long-tailed paroquet delicate green, directly quite trayful lovely little birds I ever seen. They size chaffinches part; richest crimson, others blue green violet, dozen shades colour mixed loveliest way. "Now those, Nat?" said uncle. "I do not know, sir," I naturally said. "What would England plain-coloured?" "Why, I said beaks, uncle, finches, lived seed." "Finches are, Nat, quite right judge beaks." "But I did not know finches abroad, Uncle Dick," I said. "Then know now, boy, degrees learn finches world, sparrows, thrushes, cuckoos, larks, hawks, crows, birds find England." "Why, I thought different, uncle," I said. "So people think," he said, he went unpacking birds; "the difference British finches sober coloured, hot countries brilliant plumage. So crow family thrushes, see, sparrows tits perfect dandies." "Why, I thought foreign birds parrots humming-birds, things like that." "Well, birds different abroad, Nat," he replied, "and I tell principal difference gorgeous plumes." "But birds birds paradise, uncle?" I said. "Well, suppose bird paradise be?" "I do not know," I said. "Well, think finch, Nat?" "No, uncle," I said once. "Well, is not pheasant, it?" "Oh no!" "What then?" I stood tanager one hand, lovely manakin other, thinking. "They could not crows," I said, "because--" "Because what?" "I do not know, uncle." "No, course not, boy, crows really are." "What! birds paradise lovely buff plumes, uncle?" "Yes, birds paradise lovely buff amber plumes, boy; crow family, jays, magpies, starlings are. You would surprised, boy, came study investigate matters, comparatively families classes birds belong, many gorgeous little fellows showily-dressed specimens familiar flutterers home. Look one there, top." "What! lovely orange black bird, uncle?" I said, picking one he pointed at, smoothing rich plumage. "Yes, Nat," he said; "what it?" Uncle Joe took his pipe his lips, looked solemnly. "'Tisn't parrot," he said, "because got hooky beak." "No, is not parrot, uncle," I exclaimed; "its beak like starling's." "If starling, family would belong to?" I stopped think, recollected he said short time before. "A crow, uncle." "Quite right, boy; bird one crows. Try again." "I am afraid try, uncle," I said. "Why, boy?" "Because I shall make silly mistake." "Then make mistake, Nat, try correct it. We learn blunders." "It looks something shape thrush blackbird, sir," I said. "And that is is, boy. That bird oriole--the orange oriole; another, yellow oriole. Both thrushes, Nat, East plenty beautiful colours, especially ground-thrushes. But someone come call us feed, I suppose. We must go now." "Oh!" I exclaimed, "what pity! seem begun." All work long time, hands washed, went dinner. CHAPTER TEN. ALL AMONGST THE BIRD SKINS. My aunt waylaid unpleasant task directly dinner, Uncle Dick saw disappointment, said he must me, I escaped, and, great delight, went his room go unpacking birds, excitement wonder increasing every minute. I rather disappointed skins, plain ordinary looking sparrows larks; Uncle Dick seemed set great store them, said plainest valuable rarity. Uncle Joe sat looked on, saying little, Uncle Dick I unpacking arranging, laying beautiful skins rows upon boards shelves. "They wanted unpacking," said Uncle Dick, "for quite soft damp exposure sea air. Well, Nat, it?" "I hoping find birds paradise, uncle," I replied. "Then hopes disappointed, boy, simple reason travels Florida, Mexico, Central America, Peru, Brazil, short stay months West Indies." "And birds paradise there, uncle?" "No, boy, yet within thousands miles. Birds paradise, called, found isles eastern seas, Aru Isles New Guinea." "Oh! I like go!" I cried. "You?" he said laughing. "What for, Nat?" "To shoot collect, sir," I cried; "it must grand." "And dangerous, wearisome," he said smiling. "You would soon want come back Uncle Joe." "I should not like leave Uncle Joe," I said thoughtfully; "but I like go same. I would take Uncle Joe me," I said suddenly. "He would help ever so." Uncle Dick laughed, went task, never seemed weary me, delighted I beauty birds. As one box emptied another begun, time I finished second I thought exhausted beauty collection, said so, uncle laughed. "Why, begun chatterers yet, Nat," he said. "Let see--yes," he continued, "they box upon uncle's sitting." Uncle Joe solemnly moved another case his late seat opened, layers cotton-wool, case little stained sea-water, removed, fresh beauties met gaze. "There, Nat," said Uncle Dick; "those fruits long stay Central America hotter parts Peru. What think bird?" I uttered exclamation delight I drew forth laid gently hand short stumpy bird must life big thick-set pigeon. But bird almost entirely rich orange colour, saving short wings tail, cinnamon-brown, almost hidden fringe curly, crisp orange plumes, bird's beak covered radiating crest, something like frill, arched little creature's head. "Why, nothing could beautiful that, uncle," I cried. "What it?" "The rock manakin, chatterer," he replied; "an inhabitant hottest sterile parts Central America. Here another kind I shot Peru. You see similar less orange it, crest like tuft shaving-brush lovely radiating ornament bird. That almost like wheel feathers rapid motion." "And orange orange," said Uncle Joe, approvingly. "I thought could find beautiful birds boxes, uncle," I said. "Oh! done yet, boy; wait see." We went task, damp peculiar odour showing high time cases emptied. "Now, Nat, coming cuckoos," he said, I lifted thin layer wool. "It seem curious cuckoos America," I said. "I do not see why, Nat," he replied, he carefully arranged his specimens. "You remember I told cuckoo, probably Malacca, showed bought; well, unpack American representatives family. You see soft-billed birds, wide gape bristles like moustaches sides like thin bars keep captives take." "And capture, sir?" I asked. "Oh, caterpillars butterflies moths, Nat. Soft-bodied creatures. Nature given bird suitable bills work. Mind take bird. No: do not lift yet. See, top row must come whole layer arranged top row's tails." "What! tails go right along box, uncle?" I cried. "Yes, them, boy. Be careful: tender delicate birds." I lifted one, held Uncle Joe, came his seat examine glories bird I hands. It something like cinnamon-brown crimson bird I bought, much larger. Its breast vivid rosy crimson, back head one mass brilliant golden-green. Not green leaf strand grass, green glittering burnished metal flashed sparkled sunshine. It seemed impossible soft downy, feather looked harsh, hard, carved brilliant flashing metal, turn way I would flashed looked bright. "Well, Nat," said Uncle Dick, "what say that?" "Oh, uncle," I cried; "it wonderful! But cannot cuckoo." "Why not, Nat? If cuckoos slaty coloured breasts striped like hawk, reason hot climates, sun burns skin brown, brightly coloured scarlet green. You seen modest speckled thrush England relatives thrushes yellow orange. What poor cuckoo done his hot country friends gay?" "But lovely creatures suck little birds' eggs make voices clear?" "And cry `cuckoo' summer draws near, eh, Nat? No, boy, I think not. To begin with, I believe vulgar error cuckoo sucking little birds' eggs. Doubtless cuckoos shot eggs mouths, perhaps broken fall, I think eggs carried own, which, laying, way put bird's nest hatched, established fact do; small eggs people think bird cuckoo stolen." "Are cuckoos' eggs small, uncle?" I said. "Very, boy, large bird. I seen little larger wagtail's placed. Then crying `cuckoo' summer draws near. I heard notes, live land eternal summer. But go emptying case." I drew specimen specimen, even beautiful first I taken case, though far sober hues; I taken one yet top row. When last I set one free, his tail quite yard length, admiration knew bounds. In colouring wonderfully like first I described, addition golden-green crest, long feathers tail brilliant metallic colour. It seemed then--and though I find beauties sober hues I think I alter opinion--one loveliest, I say one magnificent, birds creation, fourteen wonderful creatures laid side side I could stopped hours revelling beauties. "Well, Nat," said uncle, quite enjoyed thorough admiration, "I make quite naturalist I me." "Oh, I could go!" I cried excited tone, he merely laughed. "I would give anything see birds alive." "It requires work patience, boy. I whole year inaccessible places hunting trogons I got them." "Trogons! Yes, said trogons." "_Trogon resplendens_. Those long-tailed feathers fitly named, Nat, splendid indeed." "Glorious!" I cried enthusiastically; though worked time longer help poor, account number times I kept turning splendid trogons examine beauties again. CHAPTER ELEVEN. MY HOPES. It long task, emptying cases, even get end birds, I could help thinking, day day crept by, wonderfully patient collector Uncle Richard must been. Certainly he away years travelled thousands miles, labour obtain birds, carefully skin, prepare, fill wool, must tremendous. "And shoot all, uncle?" I asked one day. "With exceptions, boy," he replied, laying his pen minute talk. "I might bought specimens natives, rough preservers birds, I wanted specimens perfect could be, plenty poor ones come country, little better rubbish, give naturalists miserable idea real beauty birds native homes. But one tell immense amount labour cost make collection, see, Nat, open next case." Uncle Dick right. I astonished emptied next case, full tiny specimens, hundreds upon hundreds humming-birds, crests throats like beautiful precious stones, small seemed wonderful could skinned preserved. The I worked Uncle Dick I wondered, stronger grew desire follow his steps. So birds could dry warm air room, cases full beetles kinds, glistening horny wing-cases; butterflies large beautiful I used lean them, feast eyes colours, go day-dreams, I pictured wonderful far-off lands produced creatures, think think would possible go alone, uncle gone, spend years collecting various objects bring home. Then I used wake work hard uncle, writing names his lists, carefully I could, course making plenty mistakes Latin names, Uncle Joe used sit smoke look on, rarely speaking fear interrupting us, till Uncle Dick looked started conversation way rest. Then different birds thoroughly dry repacked boxes, plenty camphor preservative spices gums keep various insects away, quite couple months slipped away nearly done. I ought back school, Uncle Dick would hear going, he seemed influence aunt his word quite law. "No, Sophy, I half done him," he said one evening. "I do not want flatter boy, he valuable me. I could easily get clerk copyist make lists help select rearrange specimens; he would mechanically. Nat takes interest he doing, naturalist heart." "But he ought going his studies," said Aunt Sophia. "It quite time he back school." "He learning great deal he would school," said Uncle Dick; "and his handwriting good deal improved. It free quicker." "But his studies," said Aunt Sophia, bad humour. "Well, Sophy, he picked great deal Latin since he helping me; knows ten times much he America West Indian Islands, picked host little natural history facts, he always asking questions." "Oh yes," said aunt tartly, "he ask questions enough! boys." "But sensible questions, dear," said Uncle Dick smiling; aunt kept looking angrily I sat hearing going on. "Sensible questions, indeed!" she said; "and pray, use going he knows stick pin butterfly leave poor thing wriggle death." "Naturalists stick pins butterflies leave wriggle death," said Uncle Dick, looking smiling. "Suppose did, Nat, would happen?" "It would cruel, uncle, would spoil specimen," I said promptly. "To sure would, Nat." "It is waste time, Richard, boy shall go back school." "I done Nat yet, Sophy, I shall obliged ceasing talk nonsense. It worries me." This said quiet decided way, voice one accustomed command, aunt said: "Well, Richard, I suppose must wish." "Yes, please," he said quietly. "I boy's interest heart much you." As time went aunt Uncle Dick two three little encounters this, Aunt Sophy worsted; Uncle Dick quietly forcing her let his way everything. This set thinking much future, I knew less two months' time Uncle Dick would upon his new expedition; one unfrequented regions East Indian Islands, though he said little presence. "I like know going, Uncle Dick," I said one afternoon, working together. "Why, boy?" "Because interesting know foreign lands, uncle." "Well, boy, I think going straight away Singapore, either without stay Ceylon. From Singapore I mean traverse islands along equator, staying longest give plenty specimens. Then I shall go New Guinea, collecting time, spending perhaps four five years I return; is, Malays Papuans kind enough leave alone throw spears me." "You go beautiful birds plentiful, uncle?" I said. "Yes, boy, collecting time." "Shall go alone, uncle?" I ventured say pause. "Yes, boy, quite alone, except I shall engage one two native servants places I stay, perhaps I shall buy boat special use cruise island island. Why, sighing about, boy?" "I thinking going there, uncle, alone." "Well, boy, suppose I shall frightened?" "No, uncle, course not; will not dull?" "I shall busy dull, boy. The likely time dull evening, I shall go sleep." He went his work grew dark, his request I lit lamp, placed close his writing, remained standing his elbow wanting speak daring so, till he suddenly turned round looked face. "Why, Nat, boy, what is matter? Are unwell?" "No, uncle," I said slowly. "What then? Is anything wrong?" "I--I thinking gone, uncle." "Ah! yes, boy; you will go back school work away ciphering French. I shall often think you, Nat, I busy birds I shot, skinning preserving them; I come back, Nat, must help again." "When come back?" I said dolefully. "Yes, lad. Let see--you fourteen now. In four five years grown quite man. Perhaps care help then." "Oh, uncle!" I cried; I could keep back longer. It one great thought mind night day weeks now, prayer gratified whole future seemed blank miserable borne. "Why, it, boy?" he said. "Nat, lad, do not afraid speak out. Is anything wrong?" "Yes, uncle," I panted; words seemed choke me. "Speak then, boy, it?" "You--you going away, uncle." "Well, Nat, you have known months," he said, smile. "Yes, uncle; do not go yourself," I cried. "Take you; I will not want much eat--I will not give trouble; I will work very, hard help always, I could useful you. Pray--pray, uncle, take too." He pushed his chair away table sat gazing frown upon his face, he jumped began walking swiftly room. "I would hardly let know I you, uncle, nothing wanted I would do. Do not angry asking go, I want go very, much." "Angry, boy! No, angry," he cried; "but no, no; impossible." "Do not say that, uncle," I cried; "I would work hard." "Yes, yes, boy, I know that; would drag away wild lands live like savage half time." "But I like that, uncle," I cried excitedly. "To expose risks voyaging, savages, disease. No, no, Nat, must ask me. It would do." "Oh, uncle!" I cried, pitiful look disappointment face, he stopped laid his hand upon shoulder. "Why, Nat, boy," he said soft, gentle way, different his usual mode speaking, "nothing would delightful companion; servant, work hard, friend, helpmate, counsellor journeyings. Why, would delightful me, boy, enjoy discovery new specimen." "Which hunted wild jungle man never before, uncle!" "Bird butterfly, would same, Nat; prize revel discovery." "Yes, I would race you, uncle, see could find new sorts." "And evening could sit tent hut, skin preserve, pin found day, Nat, eh?" "Oh, uncle, would glorious!" I cried excitedly. "And I say-- birds paradise! We would make collection loveliest kinds." "Then hunt fish, Nat, pot, would butchers' fishmongers' shops, lad." "Oh! would glorious, uncle!" I cried. "Glorious, boy!" he said excitedly I; "why, get splendidly, and--tut, tut, tut! idiot I! Hold tongue, sir, impossible!" "Uncle!" "Here I encouraging boy, instead crushing idea once," he cried impatiently. "No, no, no, Nat, boy. It foolish speak I did. You must think more." "Oh! uncle, do not talk like that," I cried. "Pray, pray take you." "I tell no, boy," he said impatiently. "It would unjust encourage lead vagabond life mine. Say it, sir," he added harshly. "It impossible!" A deep sigh escaped lips, I silent, uncle turned his writing again, next week he cold distant me, I went task dull, spiritless manner, feeling miserable I always glad go hide away, sit think, wonder I uncle gone. CHAPTER TWELVE. UNCLE DICK SAYS "YES!" It fortnight conversation, whole time Uncle Dick seemed kept arm's-length life become wretched extreme, when, drawing-room one evening, aunt, talking his preparations going away three weeks' time, suddenly drew his attention me. "Do see ill white boy turned, Richard? Now it is use denying it; he is quite upset nasty birds stuff." "No, he not," cried Uncle Dick suddenly; his whole manner changed. "The boy fretting." "Fretting!" cried aunt; "with plenty eat drink, good bed sleep on! What he fret about?" "He fretting he taken his head he would like go me." "Like go you, Dick?" cried Uncle Joe, laying hold arms his easy-chair. "Yes, Joe, I am afraid I turned his head descriptions collecting abroad." To utter astonishment, I sat face burning, hands hot damp, Aunt Sophy say word. "But--but would not like go Uncle Richard, Nat, would you?" said Uncle Joe. "I cannot help it, uncle," I said, I went him; "but I like go. I do not want leave you, I would give anything go collecting Uncle Dick, anywhere, world." Uncle Joe took his red handkerchief sat wiping his face. "I turned mind dozen times," said Uncle Dick, "and sometimes I thought would injustice boy, sometimes I concluded his taste natural history, his knowledge treating skins setting butterflies moths, would shame give every encouragement." "How?" said aunt, drily. "By taking letting learn naturalist." "Humph!" said aunt; "take right away travels?" "Yes," said Uncle Dick. "But I do not think would right," said Uncle Joseph softly. "Do not stupid, Joe," said aunt sharply; "why should not boy go, I like know?" "Oh, aunt!" I cried excitedly. "Yes, sir, oh, aunt, indeed!" she cried, quite mistaking meaning. "Do suppose stay idling away time life--and--" "That do," cried Uncle Dick quickly. "Nat, boy, I held taking before; Uncle Joseph give his consent guardian, shall come pupil, companion, son, will, far lies I duty you. What say you, Joe?" he continued, I ran took his extended hands. My aunt looked she going retract her permission; she stopped, I say, first last time her life, Uncle Joseph, waved his hand said sadly: "It great grief me, Dick, great grief," he said, "and I shall miss boy Nat very, much; I will not stand his light, Dick. I know I trust well boy." "I will, Joe, well he own." "I know it, Dick, I know it," said Uncle Joe softly; "and I see he learn very, great deal. Nat, boy, young yet, stout, strong boy, heart sort thing, I know." "And may I go--will take me, Uncle Dick? Say will." "Indeed I will, boy," he cried, shaking hand warmly; "only run risks I do, stick thick thin." "But I do not think would possible ready," said aunt, evidently began repent her ready consent. "Nonsense, Sophy!" cried Uncle Dick; "I will get ready time, far better outfit could contrive. Leave me. Well, Nat, then. Only think first; may away years." "I do not mind, sir; I like able write Uncle Joe," I said. "You may write week, Nat, tell adventures, boy; I do not promise always able post letters. There, time short. You shall go morning." "Where to, uncle?" I said. "To gunsmith's, boy. I shall fit light rifle double shot-gun; more, teach use them. Get cap let us go: time spare." CHAPTER THIRTEEN. HOW I LEARNED TO SHOOT. I know going, got there, state excitement; I found dream handling guns rifles uncle placed me, soon long passage place white-washed target end, half dozen guns table side. "Look here, Nat," said Uncle Dick, "time soon steps by, boy, grow older stronger every day, I shall let gun rifle little heavy you. You must make shift first, improve use day day." "Yes, uncle," I said I looked beautifully finished weapons choose. "Did ever fire gun?" said uncle. "No, uncle." "You afraid?" "Will hurt me, uncle?" "No." "Then I am afraid," I said. He liked confidence his word, nodded approval. Just man us took one guns load it, uncle stopped him. "No," he said; "let load himself. Look, Nat, one Patent breech-loading rifles. I pull lever breech gun opens I put little roll, cartridge-- see?" "Yes, uncle." "Now I close it, rifle ready fire. Next I reopen, take cartridge, close again. Try same." I took rifle, and, exception hurried excited, nearly uncle done. "Now, boy," he said, "the piece loaded, loaded gun rifle dangerous thing. Never play piece; never trifle way; never let barrel pointed you. Remember bits advice." "Yes, uncle." "There, now, put piece shoulder, aim white target, pull trigger." "But cap on," I said. "Caps things past, Nat," he said smiling, "except inclosed cartridge. Now, then, hold piece tightly shoulder, take careful aim--but quickly--and fire." I tried obey exactly, rifle seemed heavy hold firmly, sight end barrel seemed dance about; I got pretty steady moment, drew trigger, sharp report, stock piece seemed give thump shoulder I heard dull _clang_. "Well done, Nat; good beginning, boy. There, bullet hit target extreme edge." "What, black star? Is place, uncle?" "To sure is, boy. I thought rifle would heavy you; first time, decides keep it." The man smiled approval, uncle took rifle his hand. "Brush!" shouted man, brush started hole wall, touched target white-wash. "Now double gun," said uncle. "Try one, Nat." I took gun put shoulder, aiming target; seemed heavier rifle, sight wavered about. "Try one, Nat," said uncle; he handed another rather shorter barrels. "I like one, uncle," I said. "It is ever much lighter." "No, sir," said man smiling; "it is half pound heavier. It make. The weight gun central, goes eye better." "Yes," said uncle; "it handy little gun. Load before." I found construction similar I difficulty loading barrels gun, seemed easy work slip couple little rolls brown paper compared way I seen men load guns ramrod. "Now, Nat," said uncle quick businesslike way; "once more, must remember gun plaything, though boy years must begin acquire serious ways man. To handle gun properly art, perfection means safety friends, durability gun, death quick painless object fire. Now then. No hesitation, boy: raise gun quickly shoulder, take sharp aim, fire right left barrels two targets." My heart beat fast I uncle bade me, feeling two sharp thuds shoulder, I stared smoke I expected see two white targets covered shot marks. "Better luck next time, Nat," said uncle smiling. "Have not I hit them, uncle?" I said dismay. "No, boy; one charge ploughed sawdust target right, scored white-washed wall three feet left second target." "But think good gun, uncle? I aimed quite straight." "We will see, Nat," he replied, taking gun hand, reloading quick cleverness hand fascinated me. Then raising gun he fired barrels rapid succession, hardly seeming take aim, smoke rose heads walked towards targets, looked like currant dumplings. The man us rubbed his hands satisfaction, saying capital close pattern, uncle afterwards explained meant shot marks close regular targets, instead scattered irregularly, he said great disadvantage gun. "I do not think, sir, you will find many guns better that, sir; and, you will excuse saying so, I do not think many gentlemen would made two clever shots." "There cleverness it," said uncle quietly. "When man spends his days gun his hand becomes like second nature hit he aims. Yes, I like gun. Now, Nat, say--which fault last time?" "I was, uncle," I said rather ruefully. "I thought would easy shoot." "So is, boy, practice. Now come back lose time selecting pieces. You shall gun rifle, couple hours' practice loading firing." We walked back table, I saw man thrust long-handled brush loophole side wall whiten targets more. "You decide upon two pieces, then, sir," said gunmaker; uncle bowed his head. I noticed quiet he seemed away home, speaking little always purpose; habit, I suppose, acquired his long solitary life abroad. He said abundant supply cartridges, took chair beside me. "Now, Nat," he said, soon alone, save man behind loophole ready thrust his long-handled brush whiten target. "Now, Nat, boy, fire away ammunition. It wasted, make used gun. We leave rifle practice till get sea. Now, then, begin, mind this, fired keep eye upon object aimed. I will tell why. If bird, say valuable specimen, seeking weeks, may hit object, flies short distance drops, lost sight moment trouble wasted, sometimes labour vain seek small objects dense, perhaps impenetrable jungle." "I will remember that, uncle." "Another thing, boy--a simple thing, one must learn do, eyes valuable collecting anything look treasures seek. Now mind this: raise gun, take aim, fire--not hurriedly, mind, quick ease. Then either fired second barrel, according circumstances, eyes still fixed upon bird animal shot, open breech gun, take spent cartridge, reload." "Without looking, uncle?" "Certainly: fingers soon manage little education." I could help little nervous haste I began load fire targets, two three shots I grew used I doing, great delight found I hit target. Then little practice I found much easier I generally saw one two little spots white discs; time ammunition gone--that I fired forty-eight times--I twice made respectable show upon target, I finished four misses, head aching badly concussion noise, I turned rueful face uncle. "Time left that," he said smiling. "You tired, hands getting unsteady." "I am afraid I shall never shoot, Uncle Dick," I said dolefully. "Nonsense, boy!" he cried, clapping shoulder; "you shot badly indeed, better I expected, steadily improved grew tired. All matters take time." CHAPTER FOURTEEN. HOW TO MANAGE A BOAT. The time short start long journey, Uncle Dick determined make best it, he steadily went he called education, well fitting proper necessaries voyage. These last simple. "For see, Nat," he said, smiling, "we must encumber anything unnecessary. You must bid good-bye collars cuffs, content flannels, one wear one knapsack; wash dry whenever get chance. We will take socks, time shall content nothing good boots. We must ounce luggage without." It delicious time adventure I went Uncle Dick buying necessaries trip, proud I felt flannels stout drill breeches Norfolk jackets, belt hold cartridges, strong sheathed knife. Every day I long practice gun uncle said satisfactory results; matters going like fortnight uncle said one day: "Now, Nat, must bit education, boy. We shall often left resources, travel island island boat, shall manage; come along let see I cannot make sailor start." In order he took Gravesend, where, spite rough day, he engaged sailing-boat. "Bit rough that, mister, is not it?" said rough-looking sailor stood his hands his pockets. "It rough, man," said uncle quietly. "Jump in, Nat." I felt afraid, I would show it, jumped boat, pushed off, uncle proceeded hoist lug-sail. "That is right, Nat," he said encouragingly. "I saw felt bit nervous, cheeks white; way: bravely meet terror shrinks half size. I remember feeling timid could entering open boat pulling choppy sea; I know danger, meet it, I feel calm comfortable trip two. Now then, lay hold rope give pull I cry `haul', we will soon little sail upon her." I he bade me, and, pulling rope, sail hoisted part way effect ballooned instant, boat went sidewise. "Mind, uncle," I shouted; "the boat's going over;" I clung side. "No, is not, Nat," he said coolly. "We could heel twice much without danger. I will show you. Take another pull here." "No, no, uncle," I cried, "I am satisfied; I believe you." "Take hold rope haul," he shouted; I obeyed him, boat heeling terribly I felt sure water would rush side. He laughed he made fast rope, bade go rudder, I taken tight hold side boat. There something quick decided Uncle Dick's way ordering anyone I never thought disobeying him, I crept rudder, he took his place beside boat danced upon I, never seen open sea, thought frightful waves. "Now, Nat," he said, "you see rope I here." "Yes, uncle." "This sheet, called, sail, runs block make easier give take I want. Now, boy, first lesson managing sailing-boat whether wind rough, gentle breath. Never fasten sheet, hold loose hand." "Why, uncle?" I said, seemed would saved trouble holding tied side. "That is why," he said, wind increased, I clung side, sail blown hard boat would gone enough water rush Uncle Dick let rope run swiftly his hands, making sail quite loose, boat became upright more. "I brought roughish day, Nat," he continued, "so give good lesson. Look here, Nat,--if unskilful rider mounted spirited horse he would likely thrown; person know manage sailing-boat goes one windy day, chances boat capsized, fills, goes bottom. Now, I hold sheet then, eased sail--let go, sailor would call it,--we capsized, then--" "What then, uncle?" I said, feeling nervous indeed. "We gone bottom, boy, drowned, I do not think I could swum ashore clothes taken well." "Then--then, had not much better go ashore once, uncle?" I said, looking nervously. "Yes, Nat, I will take ashore feel afraid; I tell I brought give severe lesson boat-sailing likely be; I tell besides, Nat, I know well manage boat. You enough it, I see, go back." He made motion take tiller hands, I steering he told steer, I pushed his hand back. "I thought frightened, Nat," he said; pause, I wanted speak, words would come. At last, though, did. "I frightened, uncle, much frightened; going makes feel sick." "All right, then, Nat, we will go back," he said kindly; he watching while. "No," I gasped, "we will not, and--and," I cried, setting teeth fast, "I will not sick." "But dangerous, Nat, boy," he said; "and going straight away rougher water. Let us go back." "No," I said, "you brought try me, uncle, I will not coward, I die." He turned his head away minutes, seemed looking distant shore, little boat rushed water tremendous rate, sail bellying gunwale dangerously near waves seemed cut way along. The feeling sickness troubled seemed go off, determination something it; spite sensation dread I could help liking position, way mastered waves, were, going head one seemed would leap boat, us rise slope plunge meet another, danger I feared minute minute floated away astern. When uncle turned his head he said quietly: "Nat, boy, dangerous work come me; but, boy, far dangerous work go long voyage amongst savages, perhaps; sail unknown seas, meet perils prepare encounter. Do think, boy, chosen badly? Come, Nat, speak out. I call coward, would natural refuse go. Come, speak frankly. What say?" "Was dangerous come to-day, uncle, little boat?" "Decidedly, boy. You heard old boatman said." "Yes, uncle. Then come?" He stared moment two, said quietly me, leaning forward he could look straight eyes. "To give lesson, boy." "But knew could manage boat, uncle?" "Yes, boy. I good deal experience boat-sailing great American rivers, sea." "And would mind coming time like this, uncle?" "No, boy, certainly not. I years ago Yarmouth boatmen rough seas indeed." There pause time, he said again, "Well, Nat, give up?" "No, uncle," I said excitedly, "I do not feel half frightened. I could not help then." "You would strange boy, Nat, helped it," he said laughing; "and I glad came. Now, let tell small boat water quite rough enough dangerous; knowing I do, possessing, I do, knowledge power, Nat, least danger whatever, may rest perfectly assured get back quite safe." "Then I have terribly cowardly, afraid nothing, uncle," I said, I felt horribly ashamed. "Yes, boy, generally case," he said smiling. "You afraid ignorant. Once know well about, feel ashamed old cowardice." "But it is shocking like that, uncle," I said. "Not all, boy. It result ignorance. The ignorant uncultivated people are, greater cowards seem. They superstitious, believe ghosts goblins imps fairies; savages far-off regions, sometimes greatest cowards sun." "I feel much ashamed myself, uncle," I said, tears stood eyes. He looked kindly I spoke. "I wish I ignorant." "For part, Nat," he said, "I feel proud you, boy; let tell ashamed all. Now take hold sheet here, give take I tell you. Do not afraid let slip hands fast heavy squall. I will steer. The sea heavier long reach. Tell you would like put back." "I do not want go back, uncle," I said; "let us go on." He nodded, away dashed, scudding along riding waves, he showed he steered, he that; how, little pressure tiller, he could check speed, even turn little vessel facing wind blew from, sail flapped angrily; made progress all, tossed waves. I told I thought could go along wind straight behind us, he showed could sail wind either side, sometimes almost facing us, he called tacking, I found meant that, wind came straight us, say certain point front, could get last zigzagging water, half mile left, half mile right, common way progressing brought us nearer nearer every time. "The sea rougher I thought," he said, "for I suppose may call sea here, Nat, estuary Thames, I think I will make to-day." "Do not go back me, uncle," I said, wave broke bow boat, splashing us top toe. "I going back sakes, Nat, shall soon wet through. It day india-rubber coats; glorious sail, splendid lesson you, Nat." "Yes, uncle," I said, "and I feel hardly frightened bit now." "No, boy, given far confidence before. It live learn, Nat; believe I believe you." He gave one his nods he said this, took rope hand. "Now, Nat, steer us home, boy; I will tell do. By I native boat, perhaps, matting sail, manage, sailing near equator." "But rough there, uncle, amongst islands?" I said. "Very, times, boy; light, well-built boat like I afraid go anywhere. See like duck she shape, easily she rides waves. I like one exactly build twice large, fore part poop decked covered canvas; I do not know would wise take boat." Then he went giving explanations sail, lug-sail, meant fore-and-aft rig, dozen things, showing steer. The result that, drenched spray, glow excitement, got safely back, part feeling I lesson indeed, ready put time uncle far rougher seas. CHAPTER FIFTEEN. SAYING "GOOD-BYE!" Days practice gun followed, two three afternoons mouth Thames, uncle always selecting roughest days purpose; time two I quite got dread water, ready enough hold sheet take tiller, picking rapidly knowledge steer ease boat waves would take us beam; learning tack go about: dozen little matters highly necessary one attempts management boat. And day parting came, Uncle Dick made his preparations, simple, consisting two three changes clothes, plenty ammunition, tools skinning birds animals, abundant supply preserving paste, medicines. It arranged go one French steamers Marseilles, catch course cross France, intended travel one Peninsular Oriental steamers Singapore crossing Isthmus Suez, long Monsieur de Lesseps thrust spade sand. "Get good-byes quickly, Nat," said Uncle Dick; I far Aunt Sophy concerned, though she kiss seem affectionate usual. But different poor Uncle Joseph, I known he would take heart I am afraid I thought twice making mind go. "I hardly believe it, Nat, boy," he said husky voice. "It do not seem natural going away, boy, I do not know I shall get without you." As he spoke he held hands his, though he pretending cheerful, I could see he greatly troubled, his kindness I felt I behaving cruelly ungratefully extreme. "But I am going grieve you, Nat, boy," he said quite cheerfully, "and here is knife." As he spoke he drew splendid great jack-knife his pocket, hauling quantity white cord attached, proceeding fasten round waist. "There, Nat, boy," he said, "it best I could get you; man says splendid bit stuff. Do like it, Nat--do like it?" "Oh, uncle," I said, "it kind you!" "Not bit, boy, bit; make good use it, grow strong big, come back clever man uncle, I know will." There bit history knife, day he I Uncle Dick together, Uncle Joe wanted make present. "There, Nat," said Uncle Joe, drawing his heavy gold watch fob watered-silk ribbon handsomely chased gold key large topaz seal end, "I shall give watch, boy, keepsake. Take it, Nat, put pocket; keep sight, boy, till gone. I shall tell aunt afterwards, she might not like it, know, would little unpleasant." "But I do not like take watch, uncle," I said, glad I it, seemed bad take away. "Quite right, Nat," said Uncle Dick; "do not take it." "Not take it!" said Uncle Joe disappointed tone. "No; he want watch, Joe. Where he going he must make sun his watch." "Yes," said Uncle Joe quickly, "but night?" "Then he will sleep rest next day's work." "And getting good time?" "Daylight's good time getting up, Joe," said Uncle Dick; "and sun tell time." "Ah!" cried Uncle Joe triumphantly, "but sun always shine." "No, here," replied Uncle Dick. "You much smoke fog. We going he shines almost much. Here, put away watch, Joe. It use boy journeying primeval forest, plunging thorny undergrowth bog, fording rivers letting his clothes dry afterwards." "But I liked watch," said Uncle Joe, rubbing one side his nose softly case. "Leave will, then, boy," said Uncle Dick. "He wants nothing encumber him, watch would nuisance water soaked in. Leave will." "Yes," said Uncle Joseph, "but I liked give something else make always remember he is away." "Why, Uncle Joe," I cried, curious choking feeling coming throat, "you do not think I could ever forget you?" "No, boy, no," he said, shaking hand heartily, laying watch down, he did not care take again. "It is kind you, Joe," said Uncle Dick, he saw his brother-in-law seemed hurt; "but do not see, dear boy, going lead roughest rough lives, carry time every extra ounce trouble, must barest necessities. I have often leave behind valuable things, solely I could carry them. Here, I tell what: go city to-morrow, buy one best, biggest, strongest jack-knives find; one steel loop hang handily lanyard, ready purpose cutting his breakfast hacking way canes, skinning wild beast. You could give better present that." "To sure," cried Uncle Joe, brightening up, "I will. What kind handle would like, Nat?" "Never mind handle, Joe; look blade. Let thoroughly good bit stuff, best buy." "To sure. Yes; sure," cried Uncle Joe; taking his watch he lowered carelessly place missed fob, ran right leg his trousers his Wellington boot. I turn boot-jack drag boot watch could recovered, Uncle Dick laughing heartily while. And knife good, amiable old fellow got me, certainly one would stand good stead length time. "Good-bye, Joe, old fellow," said Uncle Dick, gripping his hand fast. "I will take care Nat." "Yes, yes, will, will not you?" he cried. "Indeed I will, Joe, indeed I will; good-bye, old fellow, I am off. Till meet again. Come soon, Nat." Uncle Dick went away leave us together, sooner alone Uncle Joe hesitated moment, hugged his breast. "Good-bye; God bless you, boy!" he cried. "It is best, I will not worry going; come back soon can, mind write." I remember curious dim look everything then, Uncle Dick quiet cab; he train, speaking hardly all, afterwards he read nearly way Paris, he suddenly seemed turn merry bright, chatted heartiest way. CHAPTER SIXTEEN. OUT ON THE BLUE WATER. Everything new that, embarking Marseilles, I never tired inspecting large steamer, trying, moderate success, talk French sailors, who, learning destination, civil; but, first day two, began joke never coming back more. It comical work trying make meant began talk terrible wild beasts I meet, and, all, orang-outangs, assured eight nine feet high, would look upon me, assured me, _bonne bouche_. The third day beautiful blue water, passengers guns out, shooting sea-birds amusement merely, practice I thought cruel fact never hit anything, Uncle Dick came poop deck clapped shoulder. "Now, Nat," he said, "there is plenty room rifle ball go humming away far likes without danger anyone; get rifle shall practice." "At sea-gulls, uncle?" I said. "No, no; nonsense!" he said; "we do not shoot sea-gulls rifle. I shall start target." "A target, uncle?" I said; "but do, shall leave behind short time." "To sure shall," he replied, laughing; "and we will another." I ran got rifle cabin, feeling half ashamed go deck I fastened belt full cartridges; I got modesty, joined uncle, I found waiting half dozen black wine bottles, many bladders blown tightly, bottles empty firmly corked. "Now, Nat," he said, "here targets, I reckon upon half dozen shots steamer takes us far away, unless manage sink sooner." I looked uncle see he laughing me, he quite serious, and, obedience his order, I loaded stood ready. "Now, look here, boy," he said; "this rather difficult task, target motion. So must aim well can. I draw trigger bladder rising." "But shall know I hit it?" "You likely hit it, Nat," he said smiling; "but do, bladder collapse--the bottle shivered fragments, sink. Now let us see." It made feel nervous see many people collect me, one eager witness skill, I knew enough French understand good many remarks. Some said I must skilful shot, others I could shoot all; one way another disconcerted that, uncle threw first bladder side, I saw floating away, I felt confused I let get distance I fired. "Reload," said uncle; I so, fired again. "Reload," he said; and, obeyed him, I waited till bladder top wave, fired without result. "Again," said uncle; "do not hesitate, fire sharply." The bladder getting long way astern looking small, small I knew I hit it, consequently I felt surprise go floating away. "Do not lose time, Nat," uncle continued, quite matter course I go missing shot shot. So I prepared fire, I I saw two French passengers telescopes fixed upon object which, taking careful aim, speck seemed, I fired. To utter astonishment, smoke rose I saw bladder floating waves, fact lookers-on already informed round applause. "He would hit close," cried one passenger. "I said, he would try. It un grand shot, messieurs, un coup merveilleux." I felt scarlet face, grew ashamed first one another insisted upon shaking hands me. "Now, Nat," said uncle low voice, "after lose character hit more." "Pray, do not send another, uncle," I whispered. "Why not, boy? What matter miss? Keep practising, never mind people say. Are ready?" "Yes, uncle." "Fire, then, soon get good view bladder." I waited forty yards away, rising slowly top wave, when, calculating distance well I could, I fired, bladder disappeared. I could believe it, expected moment see come back surface; no, bladder visible; and, reloaded, uncle sent another afloat, bidding wait till farther away I fired. I obeyed missed. Fired missed, third time bladder collapsed sank, reputation marksman made. The French passengers would petted spoiled uncle interfered; alone he began talk success. "You quite exceeded anything I expected, Nat," he said smiling. "How managed it, boy, I cannot tell. The first time I set pure accident; repeated again, I say, boy, eyes must wonderfully good, aim judgment even better. I doubt practice whether I could successful." "I think must chance, uncle," I said, "for I seemed time aim, vessel heaved then." "No, boy," he replied, "it chance, result great measure practice gun; always shoot well that. When come wilds one islands visit, perhaps tramping miles rough forest, find hard work hit object aim." "But easier shoot ground shipboard, uncle, not?" "For things yes, boy, others no. But wait bit, Nat, shall see." The practice kept voyage, I became quite adept breaking floating bottles objects sent side, bladders soon came end; voyage uneventful. It always enjoyable, much fresh see. I never complained heat, great, although people lying awnings, I used get chains, rigging bowsprit, gaze wonderfully clear water watch dolphins bonita darted sunlit depths ease grace. Sometimes I wished I could fish, able sweep two powerful tail dart water I pleased, float depth, keeping huge steamer driven on. Then change would come me, I would think myself: Well, I am glad I am fish; I would watching lovely mackerel-like fellow flashing back mottled blue purple, monster ten times his size would make dart engulf his capacious throat. And I watched larger fish seize food, seemed could get within easy range seemed suck prey jaws, drawing great rush water sent gills. It tempting times one used see thin grey fellow, six eight feet long, seeming sneak side ship, astern, eddy. Every would turn half show pale parts made snatch something looked good eat; good many tries sailors managed catch one means hook baited piece ham condemned high. It six feet long, lay wet deck thrashing tail I thought shark dangerous-looking creature I expected, I said uncle. "Think not, Nat?" he said. "Why, no, uncle, I do not think I afraid shark; I think I could catch fellow rod line." "Ah! Nat, run fifteen twenty feet length," he said; "and awfully savage brutes. Such one would enough kill man." "He do not look like it, uncle," I said. "Why, look here!" I ran shark lay, stooping down, seized hands thin part tail forked, meaning give shake drag brute along deck; I got tight hold creature seemed send wave spine, one flip I sent staggering across deck fall heavily full length, crew passengers around roaring laughter discomfiture. I angry mortified I jumped up, opened great jack-knife, rushing shark, uncle laid his hand upon arm. "Do not foolish, Nat, take lesson like man. You despise strength shark future." "Why, like touching great steel spring, uncle," I said. "If anything I say backbone shark power set motion steel spring, Nat," he said. "There, now, friend helpless, examine peace." For, thrashing deck series tremendous blows his tail, shark his quietus given blows hatchet, he lay upon deck uncle pointed peculiarity monster's structure, examined his nasty sharp triangular teeth apparently awkwardly placed mouth, I shown shark wonderful power propelling water, place ordinary fin-like tail, made many bones membrane between, shark's spine continued right along extremity upper curve propeller, curve comparatively small. The flying-fish Red Sea described often necessary say anything beauty fishy swallows, saw hundreds dart sea, skim along distance, drop again. Then glimpses deep clear blue--for colour I found Red Sea--of fishes scales orange, vermilion, gold, bright gorgeous sunsets dyed sea sky wondrous hues evening evening darkness fell once, great stars, brighter, bigger, clearer I ever seen before, turned heavens vast ocean gems. Day night seemed follow one another wonderful rapidity, till one morning, steamer panting throbbing way, uncle pointed looked like low distant haze far away right. "Do see mountains, Nat?" he said. "Mountains, uncle! Are mountains?" "Yes, boy, land I could find heart visit, quite wild enough purpose." "What place it, then?" I said, gazing eagerly faint distant line. "Sumatra, Nat;" he spoke long-shaped island, familiar maps school, rose eyes, came Java, Celebes, Borneo, New Guinea, places long objects quest. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN. THE MALAY KRIS IN STRANGE LANDS. Three days later lying Singapore harbour, I one two runs ashore good look town, busy port full kinds vessels, huge black-sided steamer trim East Indiaman, clumsy high-sterned, mat-sailed, Chinese junk, long narrow Malay prahu. I could stayed month staring varied scenes bright sunshine, hundreds Chinamen blue cotton loose clothes thick-soled shoes mingled dark-looking Hindoostanees, Cingalese, thick-lipped, flat-nosed, fierce-looking Malays, every man gay silk cotton sarong kilt, made plaids many colours awkward-looking, dangerous kris stuck waist. I say I could stopped month, enjoying change, wondering Malays constantly chewing betel-nut pepper leaves. I learned, too, much seen island, tigers jungle near plantations; uncle said time waste, must get on. "We do not want civilisation, Nat, works man; want go far away wilds." "But do not mean go Malacca, uncle?" I said. "That many birds come from." "I think going there, Nat; I want get less-frequented spots, I found to-day great prahu going right away Ke Islands, well route Aru New Guinea. The Malay captain says he take us, tow boat behind." "Our boat, uncle?" "Yes, Nat; staring heathen I busy looking boat, I found one I think do. Come see." I went creek outside busiest part town, principal part people seemed fishermen, here, threading way amongst dozens clumsy-looking boats, uncle showed one I thought would last suit us. "Why, do not admire choice, Nat!" he said smiling. "It common-looking thing, is not painted," I replied. "No, boy, well varnished native resin. It Malay built, strong, mast sails well-made, though rough; better still, carry us, man two crew like, give plenty room treasures well." "But differently rigged boats Thames, uncle," I said disparagingly. "Naturally, boy," he said laughing; "but sails require management." "And anchor, uncle!" I said. "Why, made bamboo stone." "We easily buy small grapnel cord, Nat," he said smiling; "and found boat sail, think better it, I sure." On following day one board prahu surrounded fierce-looking Malays, every man armed his kris, looking bloodthirsty lot I thought I ever seen. Our boat towing behind men used long oars get us port, great matting sails hoisted, began go swiftly surging sea. "There, Nat," said uncle gleefully, "good-bye civilisation, fairly off. How feel now?" "I thinking, uncle, suppose that, us safely board, away help--" "They suddenly rise up, draw knives, said poisoned, Nat." "Yes, uncle, stab us." "Rob us," he said laughing. "And throw us overboard, uncle." "Ah! Nat; suppose did. What would Uncle Joe say?" "It would kill him, uncle," I said, tears eyes. "And Aunt Sophy?" he said. "Well, I do not know Aunt Sophy," I replied; "but I hope she would sorry." "Ah! well, need not nervous, Nat, I do not think Malays bloodthirsty fellows people say; captain here, spite his fierce aspect, gentlemanly pleasant." I could help looking captain, Uncle Dick called gentlemanly, eyes he seemed fierce savage, his scarlet kerchief bound round his head, beneath his dark eyes seemed flash angrily. "Shall keep loaded gun always, uncle, people?" I said. "No, boy, certainly not," he replied; "and may take granted, Nat, even savage people rule inoffensive ready welcome white man friend, except ill-treated civilised visitors. As Malays, I met several travellers amongst join saying quiet superior race people, may perfectly safe, pleased looked upon friends." "But I thought, uncle," I said, "that dangerous, krises wore poisoned?" "Travellers' tales, boy. The kris Malay's national weapon everyone wears. Why, Nat, long since every English gentleman wore sword, considered savages." We rather long tiresome voyage, prahu, though light large, prove good sea-boat. When wind fair, great sail spread, went along swiftly, seldom long sight land, coasting, did, many islands scattered equator; seas intersected endless cross currents eddies, seemed seize upon great prahu wind died down, often took us far course one day, sometimes took whole next recover lost. So far, spite novelty many sights seen, I met nothing like I pictured boyish dreams wondrous foreign lands. The sea lovely, sky sunrise sunset; touched upon land ports swarming shipping sailors nations. I wanted see beautiful islands, great forests mountains, home strange beasts birds rare plumage, place seemed never come. I said Uncle Dick one day sat together calm, trying catch fish make change food. "Wait bit, Nat," he said smiling. "Yes, uncle, shall see wonderful lands I like?" "You will see wonderful lands giants' castles, dwarfs fairies in, Nat," he replied smiling; "but long I doubt I shall able show beauties nature glorious enough satisfy greedy imagination." "Oh! course I expect see nonsense read books, uncle," I said; "only away home three months, got single specimen yet, I want begin." "Patience, boy, patience," he said. "I coming distance get quite new ground. So far landed tropic island, I shall count civilised Singapore; soon shall take boat coast along there, landing please, shall nature's wonders natural history heart's content. Look there," he said softly; "there beginning you. Do see that?" He pointed gloriously blue clear water, illumined sunshine, made flash wherever slightest ripple. "Yes, I see lovely little fish, uncle," I said. "Why, striped like perch. There is one blue scarlet. Oh! I wish I could catch him." "No, no; farther there, pink weeds waving deep-brown mass coral. What is that?" "Why, it is great eel, uncle. What length! thin! How winding amongst weed! Is eel?" "No, Nat; snake--a sea-snake; another, another. They dangerous too." "Are poisonous, then?" I said. "Extremely. Their bite often fatal, Nat, beware ever see one caught." We fine opportunity watching movements snakes, several came sight, passing water peculiar waving manner seen eel; breeze springing soon after, sail filled out, glided rapidly beautiful sea. I call beautiful sea, merely looked upon ocean coasts conception grandeur tropic seas amongst many islands Eastern Archipelago, water bright lapis lazuli, clear crystal, powerful sun lights depths, displays beauties submarine growth eye never tires gazing. It used worry sometimes longer calms enable get little boat lie flat, face close water I could place it, looking new world, full gorgeous corals Zoophytes, motionless, others action. Scarlet, purple, blue, yellow, crimson, rich ruddy brown, looked like flowers amongst singular waving weeds rose rocks below. Here fishes brilliant colours, curious shape, pets glass globes home, sailed out, chasing insects one another, scales flashing every turned one side dashed towards surface leaped clean water. In places sand beautiful creamy white pure could be, Uncle Dick saying formed corals constantly pounded waves. But whenever breeze rose I quickly board again, sailed till, long dreamy voyage, came one morning sight mountains; drew nearer I could see rocks rose straight sea, which, calm was, sent columns spray waves broke upon solid stone. "There, Nat," said uncle, "that present destination." "What! rocky place, uncle?" I said, tone disappointment voice. "Yes, quick young judge," he said laughing. "Wait till get closer in," he continued, using his glass; "or no, see now; look, Nat." He handed glass, I looked through, heart seemed give great throb, lovely picture I gazed upon seemed realise dreams. For distance looked sunlit rocky shore, proved glass land lovely shaped trees growing edges cliffs, covered wonderful shrubs creepers. Even rocks looked beautiful colours, every I could see lovely little bays nooks, edged glistening white sand, upon crystal water played, sparkling like diamonds sapphires sun. "Oh, uncle!" I cried. "Well, Nat, place beginning?" "How soon get ashore?" I cried excitedly answer. "In couple hours, now, Nat; I said place do?" "Oh, uncle!" I cried, "it worth coming way see. I could wander months. Shall I get guns cases?" "Gently, gently," he said laughing; "let us get harbour first." CHAPTER EIGHTEEN. I FIND THE BLACK WAYS STRANGE. We long getting harbour, snug landlocked cove great prahu come could lie well protected rollers. Our passage made easy, great sails lowered men couple canoes, paddled out, shouting singing, splashing water; then, ropes made fast sterns, paddled away again, drawing us steadily inshore. I began wonder directly whether would anything like savages came Robinson Crusoe's island; moment's reflection told Juan Fernandez supposed his island, side world. "Well, Nat, think visitors?" said uncle, I leaned prow vessel watched men canoe. "I thinking, uncle, cannot cost much clothes," I said, laughing. "No, Nat," he replied, joining mirth; "but see different sailors here?" "Yes, blacker, uncle, different shaped noses, hair curls instead straight." "Good!" he exclaimed; "that is way become naturalist. Observe everything. You quite right; going leave one race men now, Nat, Malays, travel amongst Papuans, people wonderfully different every way." I felt little nervous first going ashore, surrounded quite crowd fierce-looking blacks, chattering, gesticulating, pressing us eagerness get close up, I soon found excitement delight seeing us among them, wanted barter ornaments shells, tobacco sugar, knives. They like children, though, disposed, could overpowered us taken possession everything possessed instant, nothing seemed farther thoughts. The captain prahu came ashore us, explained one chief men wanted hut shore stay time, his countenance expanded broad grin pleasure, one seemed increase shook hands him, uncle gave handful tobacco, I small common one-bladed knife. He looked turn, seemed puzzled he ought give us exchange, while, he made understand presents nothing wanted back, he attached us, soon found possessors dark, little well-thatched hut, windows, nothing close door, answered purpose giving us shelter, chief willingly helped couple dozen his men, getting chests, boxes, stores. The next thing find place boat, towed ashore behind canoe; chief understanding want, he soon pointed us shady nook could run ashore beached safety, away waves, he helping make rope fast large cocoa-nut tree. This done, chief walked, rather strutted, round boat, looked it, it, directions, making grimaces expressive his disgust, ending kicking sides making derisive gestures, show he thought poor boat indeed. The prahu going away next day, busy scene trading went till night, captain sought us out, his broken English enquired earnestly whether landed everything, including sundry stores Uncle Dick purchased Scotch merchants Singapore, able tell likely find favour amongst savages deal. In answer question, Malay captain assured us might feel quite safe amongst Ke islanders, also Aru neighbouring isles; he said he would trust men New Guinea, unless place never seen white men before. He promised look-out us he trading fro next year two, uncle assured time among islands, promise meet us year's time meet before, come Singapore provided plenty powder shot use, ready take back cases specimens might ready, he parted us grave courtesy Mohammedan gentleman. The next time saw morning, he waved his scarlet headkerchief us deck his prahu, floating away current, barely wind enough fill sails. Some beautifully shaped canoes filled naked black islanders paddled little distance beside prahu, singing shouting, splashing sea foam paddles, making sparkle like diamonds glorious morning sunshine. But uncle I, spite delightful sensation ashore glorious climate, began feel human set made fire; I fetched water spring rock ran cascade towards sea, rigging three pieces bamboo, gypsy fashion, kettle soon began sing, coffee measured out, box dragged outside hut door act table, canoes approached shore began upon biscuit, couple toasted red herrings, got couple boxes Singapore, seemed delicious cup coffee I ever tasted. "There," uncle said last, "we regularly launched now, Nat. Those Malays savages, people law order. Now left alone wilds indeed." "Yes, uncle, come black fellows," I said mouth full biscuit. In fact, soon run beautiful canoes sands starting body come look us; loud shout gesticulating, saw one tall savage flourishing spear, went directions, savage spear came sidling towards us slow, awkward way, keeping his face turned opposite direction, gradually coming nearer. "I hope he mean throw spear us, Nat," said uncle. "Where others go?" "They seemed go woods there," I said. "Humph! And might get round back hut," said uncle, looking rather uneasy. "But show distrust. Have recognised chief morning?" "I think he, uncle," I said, "but I cannot see his face." "Well, soon see," said uncle, went breakfast, kept watching black till he came fifty yards away, apparently searching something amongst shrubs plants handle his spear. "Shout him, Nat," said uncle. "Eh?" The savage must seen us first, he looked up, down, turned _gazed_ every direction were; I shouted again, still he would look way. "He shamming, Nat, like bashful boy," said Uncle Dick. "He wants us ask breakfast. Hallo! Get rifle, Nat; I see lot heads trees there. No, sit still; boys." The savage evidently saw moment, he made rush towards dark figures stealing tree trunk tree trunk, saw dash away directly sight, savage came sidling direction again. "Hi!" I shouted, childish pantomime went on, savage stared directions wonder-stricken strange noise coming he knew whence, ending kneeling laying his ear ground. "Hi!" I shouted again; use, he could possibly see either us, chest, fire, hut, kept sidling along, staring every direction right. "Go fetch him, Nat, I toast another bloater. We will give breakfast, make friendly." I got went off, wondering Uncle Joe Aunt Sophia would said see going speak great spear-armed savage, moment I wondered would happen he attacked me. "Uncle Dick would shoot dead his rifle," I said way comfort, I walked boldly on. Still he would see me, kept sidling till I got close gave smart spank his naked shoulder. In instant he spun round, leaped couple yards away, poised his spear hurl. Then, acting his astonishment great cleverness, his angry countenance broke broad smile, he placed his spear hollow his left arm, stepped forward shake hands, chattering away eagerly, though I could understand word. "Come breakfast," I said, he chattered again. "Come breakfast," I shouted; myself: "How stupid I am! He cannot understand." So I took arm, pointed towards uncle watching us his rifle leaning table; I knew he must looking safety. The savage stared everywhere, he could see uncle till I dragged half-way fire pointed again, he uttered shout surprise, much say, "Well, would thought seeing there!" He walked me, grinning pleasantly, shook hands, looked astonished pointed ground sit down. He seated though, last, sticking his spear sandy earth, watched us I spread salt butter pot piece biscuit, handed hot coffee, I made sweet, uncle, shaking hands, gone toasting bloater upon stick bamboo. "Do not give coffee hot, Nat," said uncle. "There, that is done, I think." "I could drink myself, uncle," I replied, placed food guest, pointing it, he kept shaking his head, put his hands behind him. "Perhaps he thinks good, uncle," I said, several times partaken set example. "Or poisoned," said uncle. "Taste show good, Nat." I took tin mug coffee tasted twice, broke piece biscuit, put little herring upon it, ate it, savage watching closely while. Then his face broke broad smile more, he made believe suddenly comprehended food meant him, for, taking good draught coffee, he leaped up, tossing his arms high, danced round us, shouting delight quite minute he reseated himself, ate his breakfast, good hearty one too, chattering while, troubling least could understand word. "I am sorry one thing, Nat," uncle said. "He would eat food he afraid poisoned." "Well, was not right him, uncle?" I said, "as quite strangers." "Yes, boy; teaches us he knows poison is, savages may make use times." Our black guest looked us intently whenever spoke, seemed trying comprehend said, began laugh soon he saw observed him, ending jumping shaking hands again, pointing rifle, seizing his spear, holding his shoulder, making good imitation report his mouth. He pointed bird flying distance, laughed nodded his head several times. "That relieves us little difficulty, Nat," said uncle. "The Malay captain seems told come; another difficulty still, leaving stores." "It seems me, uncle, ought first learn language." "Yes, Nat, must. It would useful us Latin French." "Yes, uncle, shall learn without books. Hallo! what is he going do?" CHAPTER NINETEEN. OUR VERY BLACK FRIEND. The reason exclamation visitor suddenly began drag chest used table hut, he carried kettle, two three things out, rifle included; which, watched him, he patted us chest call attention he going do, and, picking his spear, he thrust ground close doorway, point standing thatch. "What he mean that, uncle?" I asked. "I think I know, Nat," he replied; "but wait minute. This fellow fool." For calling attention he going do, he ran jungle; watched spot he disappeared, he peered us behind tree trunk, another, another, popping sorts out-of-the-way places least expected see him, suddenly creeping hands knees among bushes, raising his head every looking see he watched, crawling towards hut. Just midst pantomime he became aware seen before, dozen boys coming cautiously forest, when, jumping rage, he dashed them, disappeared, he them, come back panting continue his performance, hiding creeping again, going nearer nearer hut. "I say, uncle, is not nonsense?" I said. "No, boy. He cannot talk us make us understand, he trying show us something signs." As he spoke black crept on, rising his knees peering round see he watched, last, arrived within half dozen yards hut, he rose made dash door, making believe see spear, stuck like sentry, first time, stopping short, uttering howl dread, shivering he crept crouching away, holding his hands behind ward blow. Then suddenly springing up, he ceased acting, looked us, laughed. "Why, he mean, uncle?" I said. "I know," said Uncle Dick quickly; pointing savages shore he went door hut, made go in, stopped pointed savages distance. The black nodded laughed, danced delight, pointing savages he ran door, came shivering crouching away much alarmed go in. "It right, Nat," said uncle; "he evidently chief, he means one dare go hut his spear stuck there. We made friend." All time savage looking sharply one other, make sure comprehended him; then, seeing did, he made signs us follow him, talking excitedly while. We walked grove cocoa-nut trees, passing number people passed through, one attempted follow us; quarter hour's walk he led us roughly-built palm-thatched she would, could hear sounds chopping hammering, entering found, surprise, she would far larger expected, four men busy work making boat similar one lay evidently lately built. Our new friend pointed finished boat, looked find beautifully made perfect, oars, anchor, mast, sail, finished neatness I began wonder tools man must use, wonder increased upon uncle pointing fact single nail whole boat, entirely put together means wooden pegs, fastened thin bands rattan cane. The black noticed appreciation boat, felt doubt his power, silenced once, for, giving his orders, boat half carried, half run soft sand pure blue water, he signed us enter, leaped afterwards, run right men. The breeze light, strong enough boat, sail hoisted, away went upon long rollers, rising falling easily I could help thinking clever islanders must be. "Why, Nat," said uncle, "we ought waited came here, boat worth dozen one I bought. It light buoyant, suited seas on. It hold quite much own, stronger far easier manage." All time black watching intently, striving understand his words, shaking his head disappointed manner time time. We fair trial boat, became minute better satisfied. Sometimes uncle steered, sometimes I, always find light vessel went roughest rollers like cork, without shipping drop water. My uncle managed well run along coast, see something country, result I grew quite excited desire land see wonders place; last boat's head put ran back. Now, however, black chief took rudder hand, ran us ashore top great roller, left us high dry upon soft white sand, companion jumping pulling us beyond reach next wave greatest ease. The spot he chosen close boat brought Singapore, companion walked, kicking look contempt; I must say I could help feeling ashamed rough, common, clumsy-looking thing, ride disembarked. Just companion shouted, half dozen blacks came racing clattering side, taking charge boat, walked hut, without misgivings state contents. It quite evident, though, one near it, companion, look consequence comical naked savage, took his spear stood aside entered obtained guns ammunition. At this, however, he made signs indicative his displeasure, shaking his head pointing boat stores. "I shall trade boat," said uncle; "and tell truth, Nat, I do not feel unwilling." So setting to, long pantomime scene, uncle offered black chief heavy, clumsy boat new, light, canoe-like vessel tried. The offer refused show disgust, great I expected; for, I afterwards found, iron copper fittings boat looked upon islanders great acquisition. So uncle proceeded lay boat bit time additions he would give exchange, his offerings consisting showy cloth, brass wire, axes, till chief satisfied boat own, he made signs us get guns, started inland first shooting expedition, I pulses throbbing, every nerve state tension I wondered would first gloriously feathered trophy I secure. CHAPTER TWENTY. AMONGST NATURE'S TREASURES. It land marvels me, first time I saw beauty tall cocoa-nut trees palms, like vast ferns, towering column-like stems spreading enormous feathery leaves gracefully towards earth. Then steps came upon bananas, long ragged leaves mighty clusters curiously-shaped fruit, hundreds trees, I never even heard before, among which, every then, heard sharp harsh cry bird parrot tribe. These cries set us _qui vive_, though walked little distance obtain shot see single bird, found plenty forest land full vast trees patches beautiful undergrowth, that, Uncle Dick said, matter time. "I feel excited it, Nat, seem be, boy; intensely interesting always me, search unknown birds. What is that?" We stopped listen, could make noise kept falling upon ears. It kind soft pleasant croak, ending kind deep hum, sometimes coming one direction, sometimes another. "It cannot bull-frog, Nat, near marsh water far I see." "Are tree bull-frogs, uncle?" I said, "because noise comes one tall trees. Oh! look, there is big bird," I cried, raising gun I took quick aim fired, far us heavy flapping noise wings amongst trees, silence. "A miss, hit weak bring down, Nat," said uncle smiling. "Better luck next time. Load again, boy." I hastily reloaded, went again, rising higher higher difficult ground; entered another grove high trees heard soft croaking noise before. "Pigeons, Nat, without doubt," said uncle. "No birds, I think, would made curious flapping wings." "But bird I shot big pigeon, uncle," I replied. "You will find pigeons here, Nat, four times big seen home. Look, boy, top branches great tree quite cluster them. Steal softly; round way, I go this. We shall one us get shot, I dare say." I made little circuit obedience uncle's orders, crept softly towards huge tree rose like pillar tremendous height sending branch, there, dimly seen soft twilight beneath canopy leaves, several huge birds, took flight great rattle wings came near. There quick report uncle's gun, closely followed mine, one bird fell heavily ground, others disappearing view beyond trees; companion uttered shout dashed ahead, return minutes second bird his quick eyes detected wounded, he seen drop tree distance off, fall, lead long chase he secured brought back. Meanwhile kneeling beside first, fallen patch open ground sun came down, I shall never forget delight I gazed wonderfully beautiful plumage. "A pigeon, see, Nat," said uncle; "and fine one too." "Is pigeon, uncle?" I said wonderingly. "To sure is, boy, and--" _Crack_! "That thrush, I mistaken." I ran picked bird he shot middle his speech, flew low bushes, brought back triumph. "No, uncle, thrush," I cried. "It lovely blue grey bird." "What it, then, Nat?" he said, smiling. "Have forgotten I told representatives home birds bright colour?" "But I think thrush could lovely pale blue, uncle," I said; "and I never saw pigeon that. Why, back wings almost green cuckoos--the trogons--and beautiful feet eyes! Oh! uncle," I said, "I glad came." He smiled he knelt carefully smoothed feathers great pigeon, thrusting little cotton-wool beak soak moisture might escape damage feathers. "We shall, I believe, find plenty magnificent pigeons here, Nat," he said, I eagerly watched his acts, know next time. "But I never expected find pigeons, uncle, gold violet reflections feathers." "Why not, Nat," he replied laughing, "when dull, foggy old England, little sunshine, pigeons doves beautiful iris-like reflections necks breasts? Now thrush. There, Nat, beauty. I felt I done good day's work I secured dainty prize delicately harmonious coat soft grey blue." "And thrush, uncle?" "Certainly. Look beak. This one Pittas ground-thrushes, Nat, good many islands. Some are, I believe, much brightly coloured this; bright plumage want, boy; new specimens, Nat. We must discoverers well collectors." By time lovely thrush hung two pigeons carefully beaks long bamboo, explained black companion, means little dumb-show, he must carry bamboo carefully, task which, skips bounds show his delight, he undertook perform. We went again, trusting find way back wilderness great tree trunks, rose, without branch, vast height heads, make afterwards, branches clustered thickly sunshine shut out, walked deep shadow, save found opening looked quite dazzling contrast. Here found flowers growing, saw traces enough insects make us determine bring collecting-boxes another time, purpose obtain glorious beetles butterflies saw there. "Look, uncle," I cried; "there is another, another. Oh, I butterfly-net!" For I kept seeing beetles dazzling lustre, butterflies marked brilliant colours, I ready throw gun rush chase. "Yes, better collecting ground Clapham Common, Nat," said uncle. "We ought plenty pinning to-morrow night. To-day I hope busy enough making skins. Hist! Look black." I time save bamboo birds thrown upon ground companion, went upon hands knees, crawled forward short distance shelter bushes edge bright opening, sun poured like showers silver light. "He found something," I whispered. "Then run forward, Nat, see. Be cool, take good quick aim. I will mind birds." He took bamboo, I ran forward black waving on; went cautiously I drew nearer, moments later I crouching shadow bushes edge opening, watching objects black pointing. I knew means ears birds he found, I caught sight them, every harsh shrill scream uttered, long I could see across opening quite little flock beautiful scarlet lories busily feeding clustering fruit tall forest tree, which, close sunny opening, covered leaves twigs, top ground. I utterly taken beauty sight I forgot gun, knelt watching lovely little long-tailed birds, climbing help beaks, amongst branches, sometimes hanging strong curved bills, sometimes head downwards one legs, always busily hunting food. I seen stuffed specimens before, seemed poor common-looking beside velvety softness brilliant colouring smooth-feathered, lively, rounded birds, I kept enjoying sight great extent I sure flock would escaped black companion shook arm violently, pointed gun, when, recalling object journey, I raised it, took careful aim, fired. There shrill cry birds, flock took flight, I managed get another shot, result I secured three beautiful specimens take back uncle, showing glow pride. "I want use, uncle," I said, I afraid he would think I could shoot. "Use, Nat! why, shot one pigeons morning." "Did I, uncle?" I said. "To sure, boy. At events I not, must you." He delighted three specimens I secured, saying would many he could comfortably preserve day, went exploring collecting, quite fairyland wonders. Perhaps long confinement shipboard something it; same, every place came beauties kind another. Now noisy stream leaping rocks feathery cascade; another time, grove full curious orchids. Every lovely butterfly would start flower damp spot openings, use chase then, uncle said, means preserving them. "Let us collect, Nat," he said, "and make splendid set cases birds insects; let us wanton destruction. I hate see birds shot except purpose." "We shall look out, uncle," I said, laughing, "for hard enough work walk ground; I do not know shall run." In fact, got back hut, shooting couple pigeons, shoes showing already sharp rocks formed great part ground tramped. I almost wondered uncle shooting two pigeons, already couple, I found reason reached home, called it, find everything place; one apparently entered hut, black guide took his spear, without another word hurried away. CHAPTER TWENTY ONE. FEEDING IN THE WILDERNESS. "I hope Master Ebony offended," said uncle, wiping his face. "Perhaps his way. Now, Nat, get sticks make good fire, I lay cloth cook. That is evil alone, prepare cook ourselves; we will treat to-day." I soon fire burning, watched Uncle Dick sharp knife clever fingers he quickly skinned four pigeons, placing skins would dry, busying birds. "Will not dinner first, uncle?" I said, I terribly hungry. "First? No, boy, till cooked it. You do not want eat birds raw, you?" "What! going eat those--those--" "Pigeons?" he said, I hesitated. "To sure, Nat; not? Do suppose birds bright feathers good eat?" "Well, no, uncle," I replied, I thought pheasants, one time people used eat peacock; "but birds green feathers." It stupid remark, seemed thing I could say. "Ah! they will none worse that, boy," he said, laughing, he removed birds' crops great leaf I held him. "We will examine dinner, Nat, see birds feed. If I am mistaken eat large fruit nutmeg one thing." "Then ought taste spice, uncle," I said, laughing. "Wait bit, Nat, you will see good fruit-pigeons are. Now, cut great jack-knife good sharp pair bamboo skewers, spits, we will soon rascals roasting. We cannot eat insects, birds, great treat much shipboard food." "That be, uncle," I said, pigeons, quite double three times size one home birds, stuck fire, began send nice appetising smell. "Then will not prejudiced eat them?" he said, laughing. "Oh, uncle!" I said, "I am hungry I could eat anything now." "Well done, Nat. Well, boy, long get plenty specimens skin shall not starve. Turn skewer round. That is right; stick tightly sand, let us little wood. Pick old cocoa-nut shells husks, put on, Nat." "Will burn well?" I said. "I afraid putting fire." "Splendidly, boy. The shells full oil, send capital heat." We obliged nibble biscuit waited, anxiously watched frizzling browning birds, terribly hungry. "I hope will not long, uncle," I said. "So I, Nat," he replied; "but splendid dining-room got here! Is not lovely, boy, blue sky shading trees?" "Hundreds times better going picnic Bushey Park, uncle," I said. "But talked eating birds shot. Thrushes would good, would not they?" "Delicious, Nat, small." "But would not eat parrots, uncle, lories, paroquets, sort birds?" "Why not?" he replied, turning his skewer, I imitated him, seeming settled couple pigeons dinner. "I do not know not, uncle," I said thoughtfully, "only seems queer eat Poll parrot;" I spoke I could help thinking poor Humpty Dumpty, trouble I had. "It seems queer," I said again. "But seem queer, Nat?" he said, smiling. "Come, boy, must throw aside prejudices." "Well, see, uncle, got hooked beaks," I said, helpless sort way. "Ha! ha! ha!" he laughed. "Why, reason, Nat! I might well say I would eat snipe, woodcock, long straight beak. Turn skewer, Nat. They beginning smell maddeningly nice. They are fat butter. Nothing like walk give appetite. There, take big tin go fill Adam's ale." I ran rock pool filled tin cool clear water, came back fire. "They will soon done, Nat," said uncle. "Yes, boy, I eat parrots, shall eat good many, I hope. Why, look here, Nat, parrots eat?" "Sop seed sugar," I said. "Yes, shut cage home, Nat; fruit, boy, native state. There, may take rule, birds live seed fruit good food." "And live prey, uncle, bad," I said. "Well, no; will not do, Nat. Parrots delicious. I have eaten dozens. And birds live small prey--ducks geese, instance, eat great many live things; birds live insects are, them, good. I think may say birds light diet good, draw line carrion raptorial birds. I like eat hawk, owl, anything crow family; knowing, Nat, might half-starved, that is I now. Nat, boy, birds done. Now glorious feast! I am sure I shall pick bones two." "And I am sure I shall, uncle. I never hungry life." "Then begin, boy; give tin plate say grace, wilds. What is become savages?" "Oh, uncle!" I cried, "here comes guide. He was not offended." "Thunder!" cried Uncle Dick, comical look disgust; "he come back dinner." "Yes, uncle," I groaned, I looked pigeons; "and he brought two great hungry fellows him." "Fetch guns, Nat," cried uncle comical wrath; "let us fight defence prey. No, do not; must bribe biscuits go." Uncle Dick looked miserably resigned way, seemed droll blacks come preparing feast, I leaned back cocoa-nut tree fire laughed till I cried. CHAPTER TWENTY TWO. COMPANY TO DINNER. I wiping tears eyes Mr Ebony, uncle called him, came up, carrying something great palm leaf, his companions something else basket. Mr Ebony grinning tremendously. Then he said something, two others went away, black guest, he evidently meant be, sniffed pigeons, rubbed himself, danced delight. But wronged him, he going behave shabbily, for, taking basket, he rolled dozen great fruit, half cocoa-nuts, something nearly large I never seen before. Then he nodded grinned, another bit dance unrolling huge palm leaf, showing us four good-looking fishes, twice big large mackerel, fresh one hardly dead. Mr Ebony grinned danced again, nodding us both, saying something his tongue sounded like, "Now we will jolly tuck-out;" course that, though evidently meant much. The next minute wonderful skill visitor cut bamboos kind adze he cord round his waist, slit open cleaned fish sharp-pointed piece wood, got one stuck piece bamboo roast fire. He like man springs; he things jerkily quick, jumping rushing off, come back laden wood fire, he carefully put on, nodded grinned rubbed himself. "Well, Mr Ebony," said uncle, smiling, "you really bad fellow all; come dinner full dress I glad see you, let us fall to. By rules etiquette, dear sir, soup comes first, sir. We soup. Fish follows next, but, dear carbonaceous-looking friend, fish done, pigeons are, sit down. Nat, boy, give honoured guest tin plate biscuit. Monsieur Ebony--pigeon?" As uncle spoke he pulled his bamboo spit, and, taking hold sandy end, he presented visitor, took hold tightly, watching uncle he drew his hunting-knife, and, dexterous chop, divided bamboo two, leaving pigeon. "Come, Nat, boy, fall to. That pigeon divided." Then silence I helped great pigeon, began eat sense enjoyment I never felt before; uncle I half pigeons Mr Ebony finished his, casting furtive glances one still frizzling browning fire company fishes, guest carefully turned. "Give pigeon, Nat," said uncle, "and make fish;" I offered visitor, he shook his head, began chattering, pointing fish, he kept turning; soon one done, looked good deal natural politeness see ready; not, he threw his bones his head--of course I mean his bones, bones pigeon, he crunched his white teeth, like dog, began upon his fish. Leaving fourth pigeon stuck upon spit, turn tried fish, Uncle Dick said kind perch, delicious were, especially addition little pepper, which, first taste, visitor showed fond; taken altogether, made delicious repast, without thinking dessert yet come. This visitor commenced he eaten second fish, chattering away us, opening nuts great skill, giving one us, first time I tasted cocoa-nut really like. Not hard, indigestible, sweet, oily kind woody kernel fast round she will, hard get off; sweet, soft pulp cut scraped like cream-cheese, refreshing slightly acid flavour delicious. I never saw anyone like black friend, sooner he see looks enjoyed his cocoa-nuts he jumped danced, laughing pleasure, stopping every taste himself, till finished, he took one great nuts, I saw thorny, marked sides seams, ready opening means knife. "That cocoa-nut, it, uncle?" I said, looking curiously great wooden fruit, black proceeded split open his hatchet, inserting blade cleverly get open, result unpleasant odour arose. "It do not seem good, whatever is," said uncle. "Why, must durian, Nat," he said eagerly. "I wanted see fruit." "But seem good eat, uncle," I said, I looked portion given me, appeared full kind custard big seeds inside, large chestnut. "They say delicious," he replied, helping little blade his knife. "Taste away." I tasted, he tasted, black watching us attentively; sooner he see face I made he became tremendously excited, jumping about, making smacking sounds his lips, rubbing show good was. Then, still seeing get on, he opened another, taking half began eat rapidly, dancing delight rolling his eyes, explain us he delicious feast. "Perhaps better one," said uncle, stretching his hand untouched half, upon tasting he find satisfactory had, made poor dessert, far durian concerned, greatly friend's chagrin. The meal end, took hearty draught pure water, offered tin guest, he shook his head kept making signs he cried out: "Rack-rack-rack-rack!" "What he mean, uncle?" I said. "Look, he pretending pour something water. He means arrack." "Yes, he get any, Nat--neither arrack brandy. Those medicines, boy; go get one small bottles raspberry vinegar, I will give that." The black watched intently I fetched little bottle rich red syrup, kept his eyes upon his host, when, emptying half pint water tin, uncle poured table-spoonful syrup clear water stirred up, offering afterwards black, took it, smelt suspiciously, handed me. I drank portion, found good I finished it, guest's amazement disgust; cup soon replenished, he tasted eagerly, drinking up, indulging fresh dance. "Now work," said uncle. "Let us clear away, Nat;" remains dinner carried tent, box requisites brought out, black squatting upon his heels watch us attentively, I helped Uncle Dick prepare his first skins. CHAPTER TWENTY THREE. HOW TO PREPARE SKINS, AND GO FISHING. The process simple, he took thrush lories, inserted sharp-pointed penknife skin, clever fingers turned delicate skin back, taking care injure feathers either moisture bird's flesh handling roughening plumage, result he skilfully turned skin inside cutting legs wings, cleaning bones flesh, leaving skull, stripping bird right beak. It surprising beautifully clean everything came away, fleshy side skin brushed moistened arsenical soap, wing-bones tied together, hollow skull orbits eyes filled cotton-wool, ball placed body, skin turned back slightly shaken, stranger would hardly known flesh bird removed. There odour except aromatic scent preserving soap; little sugar-paper twisted thrust bird's head shoulders keep neck short, bird lain sun hours, became quite stiff dry, exactly like skins I familiar. Uncle Dick insisted upon thrush one lories, he pigeons, whose skins tender, covered oily fat, required great deal care keep feathers unsullied. I set work then, skinning birds pretty readily old practice, little bungling I managed make respectable-looking skins. "You will soon improve, Nat," said uncle, laid specimens together sun, black nodding his approval did; skins lying long, hands washed previous putting kettle tea, new friend jumped great state excitement, pointing reddish-brown streak seemed run wood nearly specimens lay. "Ants!" exclaimed uncle, darting skins, shaking enemies come attack; contrived make little channel round one boxes upon skins laid, connected little spring water, treasure surrounded tiny moat, could keep insects away. Our black friend, evidently great chief among his people, made scruple stopping tea us, watching boiling kettle preparations greatest curiosity, always calm, composed way. "It rather nuisance always here, Nat," said uncle; "but bothered good many he go, really he seem bad sort fellow." He certainly not, though he ate heartily anything gave him, he generous could be, going return men laden fruit, fish, kind sago, bad boiled sweetened. I missed good many things I used to, far seemed glorious fun, night I lay rest looking open doorway stars, breathing soft warm air, dropping delicious sleep, dream home, Uncle Joe his garden, smoking his long clay pipe. I awakened daybreak one touching me, opening eyes I started dread I saw black face close own, grinning set white teeth. I knew directly was, though, getting I saw uncle still peacefully sleeping previous day's fatigue. I going rouse him, Mr Ebony pulled arm come without waking him. My next movement get gun; black friend objected, pulling half angrily, I accompanied outside cool grey morning. I hesitated follow minute, thinking I ought leave uncle; I could help thinking quite helpless amongst savages chose turn us, therefore could cultivate good-will. Mr Ebony, whose black mop hair stood fiercely ever, watching attentively, scowling fiercely, I thought; soon I prepared follow he began grin chatter away me, keeping repeating word "_Ikan-Ikan_," till half darkness waves lapped sand; I saw good-sized canoe half dozen men waiting, looking, paddles hands, like many fierce black executioners, prepared make end me. Mr Ebony signed get boat, feeling perhaps might going make prisoner take another island, I asked whether I ought resist; seeing useless would be, I resigned fate, jumped canoe, Mr Ebony followed; singing splashing now, utter silence, pushed grey sea. "Where going, I wonder?" I said myself. "Ikan, Ikan," said Mr Ebony, shaking something bottom canoe. "Ikan! where is that, I wonder?" I said myself. "Why, fishing-lines. Ikan, fish," I exclaimed, pointing lines sea, making throw one lines. "Ikan, Ikan," cried Mr Ebony, grinning delight, he touched hands lines, patted back--dancing afterwards till he nearly danced overboard, he became little calm, kept smiling satisfied way, shouting "Ikan, Ikan;" others saying him, highly satisfied, please I said "Ikan, Ikan," uttered shout, I felt quite home, delighted come. I do not know was, soon I felt satisfied going harm I began learn much like set schoolboys age, big, strong, well-made men were, seemed full fun, young could be. They paddled swiftly away land, working hard send great canoe well along long rollers seemed climb, glide side; and, exception heaving, slow rolling motion sea, deliciously calm, I thoroughly enjoyed ride, especially Mr Ebony, evidently big man amongst his people, taken great liking kept drawing attention every splash surface water, busy way he preparing his coarse fishing-lines. I suppose boys never cared fishing; however cruel may sport, I must confess I always passionately fond it, tropic sea sunrise, stars seen faintly there, blacks keeping rhythmical motion paddles, water lapping bow canoe, I felt indescribable kind delight words mine put paper. I think paddled couple miles, word Mr Ebony paddles laid in, line, great coarsely-made hooks formed well-sharpened pieces brass wire, handed me, guide showing throw side; I needed showing, seemed come quite natural; I began think, I passed line over, sticklebacks Clapham Common, occasional carp schoolboys used catch. Mr Ebony grinned satisfaction, threw his line side splash behind made turn time see rope running rapidly, evidently attached kind anchor. This checked canoe, floating along fast begun ride lines, now, however, floated away upon swift current. There noise chattering now, blacks sat stood quietly canoe, I saw three long spears, barbed like hooks, looking meant catching fish. There good length line hands, I kept paying out, sailors call it, Mr Ebony letting his till nearly gone, I saw end tied edge canoe. But still sign fish, I beginning stare me, patch golden light seemed start view, I could see tops mountains island catching first rays sun, stars looking pale seemed go quickly one another. "I wonder whether Uncle Dick awake yet," I thought myself, "and he say away, and--" An exclamation black companion brought back dreamy thoughts; necessary, something else roused me, sharp jerk line, snatched quite hands, fastened side boat I lost it. Mr Ebony coming help, seeing dart and, catching hold, begin haul struggle hard fish, he rubbed grinned, especially he saw I hang might keep dragged canoe. The next moment he enough manage fish taken his bait, keep crossing line get tangle. It quite startling moment hold strong fish, one darted here, there, everywhere; diving straight down, running away sea, I thought line must snap, made tugs cut hands jerked shoulders, I uttered cry disappointment, line came slack, fish gone. It puzzled see coolly others took it, I supposed used losing fish badness tackle, besides, evidently big one Mr Ebony's line take attention. "I wonder whether he taken hook," I thought I carefully drew line, coiling neatly legs, yard yard, till I pulled least fifty yards coarse cord, when, utter astonishment, sudden check rush, line began run rapidly again, fish still there, I saw made rush towards canoe, lain quite still close bottom till I disturbed jerking line I hauled in. The rest seemed made stronger ever, darted tremendous pace, I still playing it, letting run made fierce dashes, hauling line whenever grew little slack, bit bustle side Mr Ebony drew his fish close side canoe, one blacks darted barbed spear lifted canoe. It beautifully-marked fish three feet long, I glanced I wondered whether mine would big; I thought must bigger, pulled tremendous force; last struggles grew less less powerful, twice I able draw nearly surface, dart away again, I thought lost. It seemed excite good deal interest amongst savages, two stood, one either side me, ready spears make thrust fish, one stretched his hand take line me, Mr Ebony uttered fierce exclamation, caught angrily paddle, man drew back, long gallant fight I last drew fish close that, act dashing again, couple spears transfixed it, drawn side amidst shout triumph. Mr Ebony, excited all, patting shoulders shaking hands eagerly one savages, took hook, line thrown again, I time examine prize, splendid fish, flashing glorious colours morning light. It yard long, thick round, glistening scales big shillings least; fact I do not think I exaggerate I said centre rows large two-shilling pieces, fluted gilded, tinged orange glistening scarlet green. So great delight board began dance sing vigour canoe rocked about, one man went head heels sea. I horrified I saw disappear, he again, grinning hugely, slipped side canoe like great black eel, giving shake send water his mop hair, sitting watch us fish. For quite half hour caught nothing, seem matter, much look glorious sun rose sea, turning orange gold; while, I tired that, beauty trees mountains island, endless changes light shade, made heart beat pleasure I thought lovely home savages possessed, seemed explain childlike happy. I caught another fish seven eight pounds weight, different others, Mr Ebony caught seven eight quickly one other, I suppose shoal, then, laughing chattering again, anchor, proved curious elbow, evidently root tree, sharped points weighted lump coral, hauled up, placed stern canoe, turned shore. "What morning bathe!" I thought, drew nearer; starting canoe quarter mile land, I began take things, meaning swim ashore, within couple hundred yards; Mr Ebony stopped me, saying something I could understand course. "I am going swim ashore," I said, making believe leap overboard, striking arms; companions chattered angrily, Mr Ebony, horror, came me, snapping arms legs his great white teeth, looking terribly fierce, while, I shrunk away, one blacks touched back, I turned sharply, Mr Ebony holding trouser leg apparently trying tear piece, black behind pointed clear water, brightly lit-up sun, I saw two long grey fish gliding slowly amongst coral rocks, I wanted telling sharks. I pointed sharks turn, shuddering I thought escape I had; able express language, I Mr Ebony done me, made dash his leg pretended bite it, so, however, I care touch his great black limb teeth. He understood me, though, chattered delight, getting relieving his feelings short dance settling shaking hands. In another minute canoe run beautiful soft sand, savages leaping shallow water carrying beyond reach waves, I stepped Mr Ebony, made one men pick fish carry us triumph hut, others taking rest fish towards village. CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR. A BUTTERFLY HUNT. "Why, Nat," cried uncle, "I beginning alarmed. Been fishing, eh?" he said, he shook hands black friend, evidently made his mind stay breakfast; for, seizing big fish, he snapped couple great banana leaves upon lay it, man carried went away; I made show his teeth giving couple biscuits handful sugar. I explained uncle I carried morning, feeling alarm, he nodded. "I do not think anything alarmed about, Nat," he replied, "so long way touch upon prejudices; splendid fish, Nat, boy! It must kind mullet, I say, soft mouth long barbs hanging corners chubby lips. Yes, that is must be; I am sorry say I ignorant fish." My uncle idle, he made good fire, kettle boiling, begun breakfast Mr Ebony's preparations. He lost time, slit great chunks solid fish, placing great bamboo skewers roast, washing his hands afterwards great nicety, scooping dry warm sand letting trickle his fingers, palms, wrists, dry. "I idle, see, Nat," said uncle, pointing newly made skin, lovely little green lory delicate peach-coloured head, separation green feathers marked deep black collar gave bird neatness beauty attractive eye. But Mr Ebony satisfied his contribution breakfast, for, striking breast, pointing fire, saying, "Ikan, Ikan, youf, youf," several times over, I repeated his satisfaction, understanding he meant I mind fish, he went quickly. "Ikan," said uncle, "that is Malay word fish, I suppose use Malay words though language quite different." "Then he said, `youf, youf,' uncle." "Yes: youf must mean cooking fire, api Malay tongue. But fresh morning air gives appetite, Nat. I hope he will not long; turn fish, lad, it is burning." "No, uncle, it is brown," I replied, altering position great collops; "but beautiful smells!" "Yes, Nat, want fish sauces here, boy." "Where shoot beautiful lory, uncle?" I asked. "It palm-tree close us, Nat," he replied; "and now, waiting, I will put together boxes butterfly-nets cyanide bottle, ready start directly breakfast." "Shall take guns, uncle?" "Only one, Nat, we will carry turn," he replied. "This butterfly beetle day, go far direction, keep within reach camp come back food rest. It save us carry provisions." Just saw Mr Ebony coming towards us loaded basket fruit, he placed sand, dance round us he plumped fire picked skewers fish done, handing one each, breakfast began. Mr Ebony thoroughly enjoyed his coffee plenty sugar, he distrust now, ate drank did, laughing talking while, stopping every point butterfly bird went by, eating prodigious breakfast, mostly fish fruit. Breakfast over, soon he saw us ready start he stuck his spear front door, excited eager off, ready draw attention fact one us gun. We pointed, however, butterfly-nets satisfied him, ready start I suggested uncle put uncooked remains fish fruit inside hut came back. "To sure, Nat," he said, "I forgotten them." But first attempt remove Mr Ebony stopped me, uttered loud, ringing cry, whose effect bring couple dozen little naked black boys jungle, must watching us, safely hidden time. To comical-looking little objects chief said words, rush, remains breakfast carried like magic, Mr Ebony pointing sea trees much say, "There plenty want it." We long getting work, sooner denser part island foliage grew thick moist, astounded number little lizards swarmed about, darting puzzling first colour were. One moment seemed bright green, next like wriggling line beautiful blue. I found colour, though, soon I one butterfly-net, bodies brilliant green, tails blue pure sky. A couple consigned spirit bottle preservation, tramped on, growing delighted country farther went. For time butterflies absent, take collecting birds, hardly shot three different kinds parrots, lovely colour, seemed tumble upon butterflies, course one day captured lovely specimens I ever seen museum. Blue, yellow, black, crimson, tint wanting make attractive, went hour hour, forgetting dinner excitement chase, filling boxes thought leaving off. Not butterflies captured, beetles many kinds, clad armour seemed burnished, brilliant green, purple, violet held sun. CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE. WHY EBONY WOULD NOT SAY GOOD-BYE. It feelings full regret said good-bye black friend end month; time want fresh specimens made uncle say time move. We could gone shooting scarlet lories, nutmeg pigeons, pittas long liked, would wanton work, uncle discovered neighbouring islands would, wherever went, give us fresh supplies present us birds insects never seen before, last prepared start, little difficulty made Mr Ebony understand wanted good supply sago, fruit, fish voyage. At first he could understand going right away, soon he comprehend signs poor fellow looked miserable, he regularly attached us time stay, he inconsolable idea going. He helped us, however, load boat, would given us fish enough twenty people would taken it; last, early breakfast, bade farewell beautiful island, waving adieu people, seen little, turned shake hands black friend, uncle I ready present him; mine handy little hatchet, uncle's large two-bladed knife. To surprise, though, stood sands he refused shake hands us, looking serious glum, gave presents, thinking would bring smile his face, he took quickly threw bottom boat. "It pity," said uncle, "for I like idea parting bad friends, Nat, boy. I would give something I could speak poor fellow his language tell ungrateful his kindness." "I often wish could speak tongue, uncle," I said. "Yes, Nat, next impossible, fifty sixty different dialects spoken. There, offer shake hands again. You two always good friends." I offered hand black chief, he put his behind pointed boat, much, seemed me, say, "There, you have got want now; go away." My uncle tried better success, natives gathering us reluctantly got beautiful canoe lay heaving sands great rollers came in. Everything readiness, boxes snugly stowed, provisions ready, guns waterproof cases, sail lay ready hoisting, wanted wait good wave came shove ride retired. The canoe large I wondered whether able manage ourselves; I full confidence uncle's skill, seemed help ought use. So I seized pole lay ready, prepared use it; Mr Ebony, somehow got habit calling now, said something little crowd sands, when, he took lead, eight nine ran water, seized boat sides, ran her right forty fifty yards water breasts, when, giving us final thrust, away went upon top roller, uncle hoisting sail right moment, glided on. I seized great paddle used steering taken care keep boat's head right, laughing while, wondering uncle would say he turned round, he hauling sail busy notice anything his work. When last he turn round, glided lightly good five hundred yards shore, he cried out: "Hallo!" For there, front me, squatting upon his heels his white teeth displayed, Mr Ebony, apparently quite home, without slightest intention going back. "Why, mean?" said uncle, he pointed shore. But Mr Ebony intention going, learned much his language, he picked something ours, he began shout, "No, no, no, no, no," till he breath, laying he took tight hold one thwarts canoe, say he meant cling tried throw over. "This he would not shake hands, Nat," said uncle. "He could not swim ashore now, sharks, I suppose he means come us. Let us see." My uncle pointed shore, Mr Ebony shook his head, Uncle Dick pointed right ahead eastward, direction going, black friend nodded, jumping danced about, grinning muttering excitedly while. "Well, Nat," said uncle, "what is done? He wants go us." "Cannot take him, uncle?" I replied. "Oh yes, Nat, take him," he replied; "and he would useful. Only comes upon like surprise. It is, course, good thing black us, teach people come across friendly, even cannot make understand, though, I dare say, Ebony able sometimes act interpreter." "Ebo-Nee, Ebo-Nee, Ebo-Nee," cried passenger loudly; he began beat his chest show he comprehended meant. Then touching chest he cried great eagerness, "Nat, boy--Nat, boy," looking delighted laughed; give example his powers linguist, he next touched uncle he touched me. "Ung-go-Dit, Ung-go-Dit," he cried, finishing slapping his naked flesh, shouting, "Ebo-Nee, Ebo-Nee." "Very good, Master Ebo-Nee," said Uncle Dick; "since apt learning, may well go pick words, I quite despair learning yours." The black shrewd enough see accepted his presence, upon he shook hands us twice took great paddle hand, steering showing thoroughly skilful management canoe. My uncle pointed east course he wanted go; crew, called him, rose mutiny directly, pointing south, handing paddle back he grew excited, saying, "Bird, bird," flapping his arms like wings uttering screeches, whistles, cries, lifting imaginary gun his shoulder uttering word "Bang!" "That plain enough understand, Nat," said uncle. "Yes," I replied; "he means plenty parrots birds island he take us." "Bird, bird," cried Ebo-Nee, called henceforth, he pointed south-west. "It much matter go, Nat," said uncle, "so long visit islands naturalists never before, I shall trust friend here. We get New Guinea time now, lies along north. All right, go then," said uncle Ebo-Nee, he nodded smiled, pointing looked like mist upon water far away. "Nat, ung, shoot," cried Ebo eagerly; "shoot, shoot, shoot." "Why, shall quite English scholar board soon, Nat," said uncle laughing; turns held sheet swift canoe glided sunlit waves till island left began grow dim distance mountains sink, were, beneath wave, place going grew less misty indistinct. It evidently high land, drew nearer could see right left islands apparently goodly size. Mid-day came made hearty meal, canoe, urged soft brisk breeze, still gliding onwards till towards evening, sufficiently near land approached make bleak bare sterile. There ridge mountains central portion, examined place glass looked blank uninviting could be. "Not sign inhabitant," said uncle. "I am afraid made mistake, Nat; perhaps one islands may prove inviting." He continued his inspection went talking. "There plenty traces sea-birds," he continued, "for cliffs covered guano; breeding season, I cannot see single bird. But he making straight sands. Why do not try land there?" Ebo shook his head, laughed said, "No," steering canoe left island. And sailed till near sunset would dark half hour, crew, evidently before, suddenly steered canoe cove well sheltered rollers, lowering sail ran her soft sands quite clear sea, Ebo setting work collecting dry drift-wood make fire. He pointed sheltered spot among heaped-up rocks sand blown tempests soft bed, here, hearty meal well cooked fire Ebo made, lay sleep; uncle climbed top rocks swept island his glass, returning say trace human being. We slept soundly well little storm-swept island, storms disturbed us, first thing I heard lying crackling wood Ebo piled make good fire. As soon he saw awake he beckoned go boat, there, taking fish brought basket, he smelt it, made same, threw one small silvery fellow sea. "Hullo!" cried uncle, "is not waste, Nat?" he advanced sands unheard. "I think so, uncle, he means catch fresh." That evidently Ebo's intentions, he cut silvery fish scraps bait, signing us help him, launched canoe, paddled half mile, threw couple lines, Ebo showing his teeth delight he drew quickly couple good-sized mullet-looking fish, couple more, another soon coming line. But Ebo satisfied till caught five six times many seemed necessary. Then paddle ashore. It soon evident Ebo wanted many fish, cleaning setting enough breakfasts roast, he prepared rest put cook made hearty meal. This ended uncle rose. "Well, Nat," he said, "this seems terribly sterile place, may well look round; one finds good specimens sometimes unlikely spots. Let us get guns." Ebo watching us intently time, evidently trying comprehend us directly he, utter astonishment, shouted out: "no gun; shoot; gun; bird. Boat, boat, boat, boat." He pointed canoe, right sea again, seeing us laugh he burst hearty fit himself, ending dancing putting freshly cooked fish board, followed launched upon tropic sea. It plain enough resting-place upon way, soon sail hoisted Ebo took paddle steered us south-west, leaving larger islands right left though nothing visible ahead. "I suppose must trust him, Nat," said uncle; "but look rather wild work cruising seas open canoe, quite mercy savage whose language cannot speak." "But I think he must before, uncle," I replied. "No doubt it, boy." "Nat, boy," cried Ebo laughing, he caught part uncle's speech. "Yes, he before, probably touched place he seen, thinks he seen, plenty birds. At rate, weather holds fair difficult thing run island shelter." I thinking thing, seemed risky proceeding sail right sea guidance savage; much romance novelty idea sailing away like Columbus search new land, I thoroughly enjoyed it, farther sailed excited I grew. It plain enough Ebo insisted upon good supply fish, dined made evening meal same, land sight, last lower edge sun seemed touch crimson water, sending path light right canoe, whose sail seemed turn ruddy gold, still land sight. My uncle stood used glass, gazing straight direction seemed goal; Ebo shook his head, closed his eyes made believe sleep, pointing us turn. "He wants us lie sleep, Nat," said uncle, "but question;" he shook his head. Ebo tried get us lie down, finding would not, he sat laughing looking merry could be, although land sight, last, sun disappearing, he placed paddle uncle's hand, pointing south-south-west course steered, he lay went fast asleep. I sat talking uncle holding sheet, though breeze steady seemed quite unnecessary, he steered canoe onward darkness, taking stars his compass, till motion boat darkness combined send deep sleep. I closed eyes started several times before, last time, I opened eyes see black figure Ebo seated steering, sun horizon, uncle stretched bottom canoe fast asleep. Ebo grinned I stared him, I looked I found far away west land must passed night, still sailing space. The water bright golden again, air felt delicious; I began wish journey's end, pointing ahead I tried learn steersman much farther he going take us. His reply point straight ahead, still speeding on, when, five six hours' sleep, uncle jumped wakefulness, ready partake waiting meal cold fish, biscuits, fruit; coffee, case like I made means spirit-lamp, kept abeyance time. "Well, Nat," he said, "is wild-goose chase nearly end? Is land sight?" "No, uncle," I said, gazing carefully ahead. Just Ebo pointed telescope, made signs uncle use it. "Look through?" he said black. "All right, friend, I will;" placing his eye he stood boat he cried I eagerly watched him, "Land ahead, Nat, apparently wooded shore!" CHAPTER TWENTY SIX. AN UNKNOWN ISLAND. By time made hearty meal Ebo pointed triumph faint hazy speck distance, growing minute minute plainer eyes. Ebo watched countenances intently, suddenly broke with: "Bird--shoot--bird." "He seems brought us impression good place, Nat, I trust prove so," said uncle. "I hope unpleasant savages hinder work." As drew nearer glass frequently brought bear, neither uncle I could detect sign habitation, even within quarter mile shore; but, Uncle Dick's great delight, place proved densely wooded parts, lofty hills looked green park-like, large trees dotted there. The beach soft white sand, upon waves curled gently over; twenty yards highest marks made tide, tall palms, loaded fruit, drooped great feathery leaves. As far could see island large, interior mountainous, green hills running great height, part well-clothed wood; great delight, ran boat cautiously upon sand, could hear screams parrots whistling twittering innumerable birds. "We may well prepared danger," said Uncle Dick, loading his gun, I followed suit; Ebo began chatter expostulate us leaving boat, signed us help run next wave well ashore, rope could made fast round nearest palm stem. This did, black's next movement collect wood fire. To humour waited he lit fire, kept making little incursions amongst openings see could spy signs human habitation. But look would saw nothing, soon became evident occupants part island. Ebo seemed satisfied contented evident nothing fear; obeyed his signs helped make good fire, followed open park-like piece country till half mile sea, his object guiding us plain enough, he pointed little flock half dozen pigeons, big, seemed me, ordinary fowls, getting within range fired together, shot four. Ebo rushed forward triumph, I followed, regret I attended Uncle Dick's instructions reloading, I could obtained specimen curious great black parrot cockatoo, I could quite see which, flew across opening. But secured birds shot, going back uncle I set skinned them, handing bodies Ebo cook, carefully preserved skins, admiring while. For rich warm slate colour, bird bore delicate grey crest upon his head, gave noble look, making bird seem prince among pigeons. Handsome appearance birds, none less delicious eating. No doubt open-air life good deal keen enjoyment eating birds shot; feeding pigeons spices, nuts, sweet food, flavour given flesh fine. Dinner over, expedition; Ebo protested loudly. Taking axe beckoning us follow accompanied patch bamboo, helped cut good selection stout pieces, number lengths rattan cane, grew wonderful way. I seen growing before, never perfection; seemed run one tree another, running along bushes short distance ascending another, till Uncle Dick computed canes quite hundred yards long. It evident Ebo meant, he telling us time, though word could understand, helped him. "As make hut shelter, Nat, I suppose he expects us stay time, good sign, he evidently knows plenty specimens had." "Do think naturalist before, uncle?" I said. "I hardly dare think thing, Nat," he replied; "but I cannot help feeling hopeful. As I judge seems island he his fellows sailed time another, possible European foot never trodden before." "Let us hope so, uncle," I said; "and then, collection shall get!" "You make sanguine yourself, Nat," he said laughing; began hot busy talk much, carrying bamboos rattans edge forest, beneath widely spreading tree, whose branches every beautiful lory came perched, fly screaming, Ebo began build. Sharpening four stout bamboos forcing soft sandy soil four corners hut, he soon bound many horizontally five feet ground, tying cleverest way cane. Then he tied couple across end, laid long stout bamboo forks made ridge-pole, binding strongly could ingenious twist, making rafters smaller bamboos, couple hours he made rough framework. Towards latter part time, obedience his instructions, given word mouth wave hand, Uncle Dick I cut great number palm leaves large size, Ebo rapidly thatched hut, making time dark rough efficient shelter, lay sleep night upon pile soft dry grass, quantity naturally made hay close hand. We tired night trouble sides hut, glad roof keep dew, and, trusting dangerous wild beasts, followed Ebo's example, lying sleeping soundly till sun sea. CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN. FRESH TREASURES. Ebo set work earnestly finish hut, binding palm leaves thatch long canes, he cleverly threaded out, afterwards secured ends. Then he cut long ends bamboos leave tidy commencing sides. My uncle anxious I go upon expedition; shelter obtained here, became evident upon uninhabited island, he saw necessity boxes stores roof. So set manfully work helping black, cutting bamboos, bringing large palm leaves, fetching long rattan canes, handing him; while, saving he left meals, Ebo toiled like slave, working industry expected find inhabitant one sleepy isles. At last, though, he finished, his childish delight seemed know bounds. He danced shouted, ran out, walked round hut, strutted us full self-satisfaction, his tongue going while, evidently feeling highly delighted smiles words praise. No time lost transferring boxes stores beneath roof; then, wanted quite three hours sunset, uncle proposed, way recompense drudgery, take guns see could obtain specimens. Ebo looked delighted, and, without told, obtained short piece bamboo ready carrying birds shot. Then, taking his spear canoe, he smiled show ready he was; Uncle Dick took arm led door hut. "Put spear there, before, keep visitors, Master Ebo," he said; he accompanied his request signs express he wished. Ebo understood once, made stick spear ground door, he stopped short shook his head, ran yards, peered amongst trees; turned round shook his head again; ran another direction peeped about, coming back shaking his head again. Ebo's motions said plainly could be: "There nobody ourselves," satisfy us he led way high hill mile away, whence splendid view one direction, lay clump mountains. Look way would nothing rich plain dense jungle, occasional patches park-like land. Not sign huts, Ebo looked us shook his head, counting us afterwards his way--one, two, three, tossing his arms air. "We luck, Nat," said uncle. "This island must swarm natural history specimens, he brought us he thought good place; make best use time. Look out!" As he spoke he raised his gun fired bird darting narrow rift two rocks looked riven asunder. I thought he missed it, Ebo ran ahead returned directly lovely kingfisher glorious plumage. "If get nothing island, Nat, I shall satisfied," said uncle gazed lovely creature Ebo brought; seeing satisfaction faces he indulged another dance. "Yes," continued uncle, patting Ebo's black shoulder, "you treasure, Ebo, I see shall greatly debt. Now, Nat, must feather bird spoiled. I feel ready go back purpose prepare it." It indeed lovely creature; I gazed upon delicately beautiful tints I felt puzzled. It rich purple back, azure-blue shoulders dashed speckled lighter blue, parts pure white, seemed throw rich colours back. But great beauty specimen tail, long two centre feathers continued almost without plumes till end, spread like couple racket bats, making little bird foot half long. I felt I never tire gazing beautiful specimen, quite understood uncle's feeling wishing make sure preserving once. Just then, though, large bird flew across, I fired, far distant, shots rattle feathers. "Did see great beak, uncle?" I said. "Yes, Nat, hornbill. I daresay shall find plenty here. They take places East toucans West. But now, Nat, easy shot you--look! Ebo pointing it. There, seated twig. Now see he darts fly back again. No, he more. We scared him." But time I seen bird, taking quick aim hovered snatched fly kind, I fired brought down, find I got prize shape lovely little bee-eater, plumage rich green blue, brown black, tail also rendered beautiful extension central feathers two long thin points. My uncle's gun spoke next moment, second barrel following quickly, Ebo ran picked another lovely kingfishers, one different kind rich coral-red beak, short tail, back beautifully barred blue black like ornamental feathers wings jay. "That bee-eater shot, Nat, lovely thing too. Mine kingfishers." "There must little stream hollow rocks, uncle," I replied. "No, Nat, I do not suppose is," he said, smiling. "But say that?" "Because kingfishers, uncle. There must stream pool somewhere near." "I daresay is, Nat; account birds, lad. They dry kingfishers, Nat. They live upon fish, upon beetles, butterflies, moths, darting picking ground without wetting feather." "Why, curious!" I said. "They beaks like kingfishers home." "Very much like them, Nat," he said; "but catch fish. But come, must get back hut, shall never get birds turned skins dark. Look out!" We fired closely together sounded like one shot, three great pigeons fell heavily ground--part little flock passing head. Ebo seized grin delight, he knew meant larder, hastening back time strip prepare skins night fell, when, work ended, fire relit, kettle boiled, sort tea-supper moonlight, dark forest behind silvery sea us, ended busy day. CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT. A BIT OF A SCARE. That night I lay dark, beach outside lit-up moon, listened strange noises forest behind hut, I felt ready awaken uncle Ebo, sure I I could hear wild beasts move. Should tigers, leopards, even wild boars, chance attacked? Or might one huge serpents I read much might creep open door. I wanted brave, somehow night I felt horribly afraid, even humming buzz night-flying beetle making start. Perhaps I over-excited, perhaps, uncle would said, I eaten much. At events, may, I could go sleep, lay turning hot cold wishing morning. The silence seemed dreadful, idea uninhabited island, instead delightful felt bright sunshine, appeared horrible, I lay thinking far human help, boat happened drift away left starve. Of course nonsense, clever savage Ebo ingenuity tools could built another boat--not good one arrived in, quite strong enough bear us calm sea one islands trading vessels came. Then I grew hot seemed dripping perspiration, horror increased. What would become us food powder shot gone? We starve death. And I began tremble wish I come, feeling I would give anything back home old bedroom, gas outside road policeman's heavy foot heard he went along his beat look-out burglars. I ready meet Aunt Sophia next morning receive severest scolding I ever had--anything away I was. Then I tried reason think even powder shot gone could make bows arrows, set traps, food ran short could always make fishing-lines catch scaly creatures swarmed amongst rocks round shore. Besides cocoa-nuts plenty, abundance fruit. I thought I home I revelled idea place, uninhabited island, glorious one, far beautiful productive Robinson Crusoe, I far better off, addition man Friday I clever uncle companion, guide, protector. At thought last word I stretched hand awaken tell horrible feeling dread; I drew back shame, afraid of? I grew little calmer lay gazing open door brilliant moonlight, made leaves glisten silver, beneath amidst thickets look dark black soft velvet. Then came strange sighing noise forest behind us, made flesh creep I wondered could be. Then wild, strange cry, soon heavy crash something falling. After that, I lay bathed perspiration oppressed terrible feeling loneliness seemed increase, I fancied I heard pat, pat, pat, pat animal running along ground, followed hard breathing. "That must wild beast," I said myself; I rose one elbow listen, meaning get hold gun load sound came nearer. Then confused troubled way I began ask whether I ought awaken Uncle Dick time kick Ebo make seize his spear help defence. But big wild beasts islands, uncle said several times, even expressing his doubt anything large New Guinea. "But great apes," I said myself. "I know Borneo, others island like this?" imagination I began picture hideous, great orang-outang cautiously advancing towards cabin. I knew could fierce tremendously strong. Then, too, travellers described quite giants six, seven, eight feet high, supposing really wild beasts island, undoubtedly wild men woods, Malays called them, one coming hut. Of course; I knew well I seen it. That crash I heard made one monsters, hard breathing I could hear now. It use I tried make believe I listening Ebo breathing, every indulging regular snore. No, I would believe it, lay feeling horror increasing moment till I lay helpless now, I wanted get gun I could not, I dared move. Then another horror shape curious lapping noise sea, splashing wallowing great beast; I know this, horrible crocodiles came rivers lived mouths, going sea back, though seen river yet island, evident one monsters crawling shore, I seemed see moonlight great coarse, scaly back, crooked legs, long stiff tail, hideous head sly cruel-looking eyes, wide, long, teeth-armed jaws. After I knew well could strange instinct would scent us come nearer nearer, crawling along soft sand leaving track could easily seen next day. I even seemed see footprints wide-spread toes, long, wavy furrow ploughed tail. It one terrible nightmare, growing worse worse; noise shore increased, rustling crashing woods; strange humming buzzing around, breathing sounded closer deeper. At last I felt I could bear longer, I rouse uncle Ebo destroyed, I tried call out, voice sounded weak faint; terrible sense oppression me, humming singing noise increased. I contrived, however, touch Ebo, he muttered angrily changed his position, noise he made waking uncle, started one elbow listen. "He hears all, then," I said myself, wonderful sense relief I knew saved. Why I spring help him? say. Ah! I could do, I lay perfectly paralysed fright quite speechless, till horror I saw dim light reflected moonbeams uncle lie again, I made tremendous effort gasped forth something another, I cannot say what. "Hallo!" he exclaimed. "Anything matter, Nat?" getting quickly he struck match lit little wax taper he always carried brass match-box, part formed stick. He kneeling side directly hold hand, his touch senses seemed come back me. "Quick!--the guns!" I panted; "wild beasts!--a crocodile, ape, uncle. I hearing come." "Nonsense! boy," he said, smiling. "No, no; nonsense, uncle. Quick!--the guns!" "No, dear boy, nonsense. There noxious dangerous beasts here. You quite safe them. You dreaming, Nat." "I have asleep," I said piteously. "Have not you, lad?" he said, one hand brow wrist; "then fancying troubles. Nat, boy, got touch fever. I am glad woke did." "Fever, uncle?" I gasped, horror situation increased, like flash came idea ill wilderness, away human help comfort; and, ludicrous may sound, I forgot Uncle Dick, began think Dr Portly, big brass plate upon his door Clapham Road. "Yes, boy, touch fever, we will soon talk him, Nat; we will nip bud. A stitch time saves nine. Now shall see what is little flat tin box I brought. I saw stare I packed up." "I thought preserving things, uncle," I said. "So is, boy, full preserving things, one shall soon dose. I hope like bitters, Nat?" He laughed pleasantly he seemed give courage, I glanced frightened way opening I said I much mind. He saw glance, went outside cup his hand, come back minutes full water pool close by. "No wild beasts about, Nat, boy," he said merrily. "They fever phantoms." "But I sleep, uncle," I protested. "Sign ill, Nat, generally drop instant sleep soundly hours. There wild beasts, boy, islands." "But I am sure I heard great ape breathing hard, broke great branch forest." "And I am sure, Nat, heard Ebo snoring; branch breaking, heard, I dare say, dead one fall. They always falling old forests. We do not notice noise day, birds singing, night everything sounds wonderfully clear." "But I am certain I heard crocodile crawling sea, creeping towards hut." "And I am certain not, dear boy. We muddy tidal river frequent. It fever-born, Nat, boy; believe me." All he talking I saw he busy getting something ready. First he put little white powder glass, he poured drops something it, filled water, stirring little bit glass rod kneeling me. "There, Nat," he said kindly, "drink off." "What it, uncle?" I said, taking glass hot trembling hand. "A preserving thing, boy. One greatest blessings ever discovered traveller. It quinine, Nat, fever's deadliest enemy. Down once." The stuff intensely bitter, mouth hot parched, water cool pleasant, I quite enjoyed it, drew deep breath. "There, now, lie again, boy, sleep. Do not fill head full foolish imaginings, Nat. There nothing fear wild beasts here." "But I going ill, uncle?" "No, certainly not. You sleep till three four hours past sunrise, waken, feeling little weak, perhaps, respects right. Perhaps come back again, rout quinine. Why, Nat, I have dozens attacks." I lay back, feeling rest, satisfied uncle right beasts, sound trouble me; lapping water, seemed waves beating softly upon sand, heavy breathing certainly Ebo's, gentleman never moved since I touched him. Then I saw uncle shut his little tin case replace chest, put wax taper, lie upon his couch dry grass, yawning slightly, lying gazing open door, I could see his eyes shine. But degrees faintly lit-up hut, bamboos roof, chests, guns, Ebo's spear, seemed grow indistinct, restful peace. CHAPTER TWENTY NINE. A STRANGE CRY IN THE WOODS. When I opened eyes sea dancing sparkling, leaves waving gently soft warm breeze. I could see I lay water rippling gently upon sand, far hut door uncle busy skinning bright-plumaged bird, Ebo cooking couple pigeons, watching little kettle stuck amongst glowing ashes. I comfortable, feel disposed move, seemed calm pleasant; I thought little previous night's fancies I ready smile perfectly absurd. I speak, lay quite still, gazing lovely picture framed open door, thinking beautiful was, foolish I go fancying dangers I night. Then pleasant, too, watch Uncle Dick, much quicker cleverer he making skin I was. Still, I hoped practice get quick. He went till he dressed interior skin soap preparation, filling certain parts cotton-wool, tying wing-bones together, he turned back, smoothed plumage, I saw another short blue-barred kingfishers similar obtained before. I could help noticing I lay quietly great care attention he gave his task, seeming he thoroughly enjoyed his work, felt duty well. At last, though, put away dry, carefully washing his hands he came hut door gently see I awake. "Ah, Nat," he said smiling, "how long sleep?" "Long sleep, uncle!" I cried. "Is late?" "Nearly noon, boy. Well, you?" "I--I think I am quite well, thank you, uncle," I said, springing up, feeling ashamed lying there, turning giddy I fallen Uncle Dick caught arm. "Sit down," he said quietly. "There, better." "Yes; I feel better now," I said. "To sure do. Well, Nat, I think beaten fever. You feel weak day two, soon right." And proved. For two three days weakness, strange weary feeling quite new me, I rapidly got better felt dread alone night; fact I slept soundly could be, got ready fresh new work. Uncle Dick kind, I stronger he contented shooting hut, finding plenty beautiful birds; soon I strong enough prepared cold provisions started longer exploration. Ebo delighted, capered excess his joy, chattering his tongue introducing every English word he picked up, began good many; he little idea putting proper use, muddling terribly, keeping perfect humour matter laughed him. "It belief, Nat," said Uncle Dick, "that shall find something better worthy notice yet make good long expedition wooded parts island." "I thought could better off, uncle," I said, "for getting lovely birds." "So are, Nat; one never satisfied, always wants more. I expect shall find birds paradise, strikes cry I heard several times daybreak comes one them." "Birds paradise! Here, uncle?" I cried. "Why not, boy? It likely place possible imagine: island near equator, deeply wooded, hardly ever visited man. I say must find here." "Oh, uncle!" I cried eyes glistened, I felt cheeks flush anticipation seeing one noble birds muzzle gun. "I shall greatly disappointed find some, I search now, I thought would like go, plenty work close home." I say much, I felt grateful his thoughtfulness, next morning day, tramping thick herbage mounting rising ground towards south. "I purpose trying get right across island to-day, Nat," he said, "and tired get back way must contrive enough shelter camp one night woods." "I shall mind, uncle," I said, went. This time provided light small baskets, could swing cord passed right shoulders, long deep enough hold good many specimens. We three bore these, Ebo's double size ours, he gun use, trotted easily side his spear his shoulder. Before gone two miles several lovely birds fallen guns, principally thrush family, way amongst bushes rising ground. It impossible describe properly beauty lovely softly-feathered objects. Fancy bird size thrush shorter tail, instead olive-green speckled brown, think jetty head striped blue brown, body blending buff, pale greyish blue, crimson, black. We kept on, taking prizes baskets, lay cotton-wool, examine admire again. No sooner feasted eyes upon birds something bright colour fell guns. Now would golden oriole glittering sun-bird. Then beautiful cuckoo crimson breast cinnamon-brown back. Then beautifully painted paroquet delicate long taper tail; act examining one birds, when, paused edge forest great trees skirting, uncle grasped arm, for, sounding hollow, echoing, strange, rang loud harsh cry: "_Quauk-quauk-quauk! Qwok-qwok-qwok_!" This answered distance there, several birds, birds, scattered forest. "There, Nat," said uncle; "do hear that?" "Yes," I said, laughing. "I could hear plainly enough, uncle. What made by--some kind crow?" "Yes, Nat, kind crow." "Are worth trying shoot, uncle?" I asked. "Yes," he said peculiar smile; then, cry rang again, apparently nearer, he signified Ebo he try guide us direction sounds. The black understood well enough, taking lead he went swiftly twilight forest, easy walking beneath vast trees, nothing grew fungi pallid-looking little plants. And went on, trees seeming get taller taller, mightier girth. Now caught glimpse blue sky, seldom, dense foliage forming complete screen. Every could hear hoarse harsh cry; though went tremendous distance, seemed get nearer, till Ebo stopped short, hoarse cry overhead, I saw something sweep great branches hundred fifty feet away. I time fire, uncle's gun made forest echo, though nothing fell. "I missed it, Nat," he said, "for branches way; I thought I would let slightest chance go by." "What it, uncle?" I said. "One crows," he replied, laughing; Ebo went again. Just uncle glanced his compass, saw travelling right direction--due south--so matter far went; though kept hearing cries crow-birds, I eventually called them, saw more, felt disappointed time, long; many fresh objects notice. At last daylight appeared ahead, came amongst trunks, risen every side us like pillars, beautiful open valley dotted trees, green luxuriant branches right ground. We spend many moments gazing beautiful landscape, lovely I half expected see houses there, result clever gardening; nature's work, every tree many birds, lovely kinds, seemed come place world make collection. "There, Nat, look!" said uncle, pointing where, full sunshine, great bird train soft amber plumage flew across opening, disappear amongst trees; "there goes one crows." "That lovely buff bird, uncle?" I said; "why, looked like I think bird paradise would be." "And that is was, undoubtedly, Nat," he said, "though I never saw one wing." "But said crow, uncle," I said. "Oh! course, said birds paradise belonged crow family. I wish could shot it." "It would required rifle hit distance, Nat; wait bit. We learned one thing, fact birds paradise here, satisfies cannot better keep present quarters. This place exceeds highest hopes collecting ground. There, look bird great hollow-looking tree." "I looking it, uncle. It one great birds big bill thing upon like deck-house." "Yes," said uncle, "and something more. Look, Ebo gone on. He seems understand looks he cannot make words." For Ebo trotted forward towards tree taken attention, great hornbill flown dead trunk ten-feet ground, flapped away. CHAPTER THIRTY. A CURIOUS MARRIED COUPLE. As Ebo reached tree he turned back us laughing pointing his spear, signed us come, though even close I could see nothing tiny hole trunk great tree. "It cannot nest, uncle," I said, "because big enough. Perhaps wild bees' hive." "I do not know yet," said uncle. "I am like you, Nat, little bit puzzled. If small I say nest way great hornbill keeps flapping screeching." "Shall I shoot it, uncle?" I said eagerly. "Well, no, Nat, I hardly like that. If I think, would cruel, starving young, easy get specimen hornbill want one, though really common bird hardly worth carriage skin." Just then, show us, Ebo began poke hole point his spear, saw point bill suddenly pop dart again, great hornbill shrieked shouted, I call nothing else, queerly sounded voice. "Why, cannot hornbill's nest, uncle!" I said. "Look small is." "Yes, small, hornbill's nest all," said uncle, Ebo kept poking hole bringing pieces seemed clay. Then, seeing interested were, he took his basket, lay his spear, taking hatchet his waistband cut nicks his toes, began climb up, big hornbill screeching horribly while, till Ebo level hole, end bill kept peeping. Then hornbill flew Ebo began chop away large quantity dry clay till quite large hole opened, showing original way hollow tree; now, great deal hoarse shrieking black got hold great bird inside, quite fight he could drag legs, dropping it, flapping great wings, ground. "Undoubtedly female hornbill," said uncle. "How singular! The male bird must plastered her fed her she sitting. That saw, Nat." "Then must eggs, uncle," I cried, old bird-nesting propensities coming front. But Ebo already tree soon he rid great screaming bird, place bringing eggs he leaped back earth young hornbill, curious creature possible imagine. It like clear leather bag bladder full something warm soft, comical head, legs, wings, good-sized soft beak, blue stumps feathers represent tail, nothing else. It was, speak, horribly naked skin soft jelly staring eyes, kept gaping helplessly food, evidently full could be. "Are birds?" said Uncle Dick pointing hole; Ebo shook his head, running up, thrusting his hand, coming again. "Very curious, Nat," said uncle. "The male bird evidently shuts his wife she laid egg, protect her birds perhaps monkeys till she hatched, he goes feeding her her young one." "And well too, uncle; he fat butter." "Feeding well till young one fit fly." "Which will not yet, uncle, he has not feather." "No, boy. Well, shall them?" said uncle, still holding screeching mother, I nursed soft warm bird baby, her daughter son. "Let us put little--no, I mean big one back, uncle," I said, laughing. "Just I thinking. Climb it." I easily climbed nest glad get young bird without cracking skin, seemed tender; sooner I rolled softly climbed uncle let mother go, strong her love her young she immediately flew hole crept in, croaking screaming uneasy, angry way, she scolding us interfering her little one, distance amongst trees cock bird kept answering her noisiest discordant cries. Every came sight, flying heavily across openings trees, great cream-coloured, clumsy-looking bill shining looking bright sun, cries uttered tempted one put one's fingers one's ears. And time hen bird inside tree kept answering peevishly, much say, Look here: shame is! Why do not come drive people away? "This one singular facts natural history I met with," said Uncle Dick, still gazing curiously tree watching female hornbill's head she kept shuffling herself uneasily, seemed object much light. "I think I know is, uncle," I said, laughing. "Do you, Nat," he replied. "Well, cleverer I know. Well, it?" "The hen hornbill must like Uncle Joe's little bantam, never would sit till she shut dark, that is Mr Hornbill fastened his wife." My uncle laughed, then, Ebo's great delight, he fidgeting wondering stopped long, continued journey search birds paradise, whose cries could heard distance every then. But though kept following sounds seemed get nearer, make matters worse, scare uncle said would better fire, consequence missed shooting beautiful birds flitted tree tree. "We must give birds paradise to-day, Nat," said uncle last. "I see use follow them; shy." "Then get any?" I said disappointed tone; walking hours I tired. "Lie wait them, Nat," he replied smiling. "But come, we will try shoot birds food good dinner. You feel ready fresh walk." By means little pantomime made Ebo understand wanted, little he taken us great pigeons thronged trees, many feeding kind nut fallen great profusion lofty kind palm. If wanted hundred times many big pigeons could easily shot them, little used attack; brought sufficiency present wants, soon Ebo understood birds skinned plucked eating, he quickly good fire blazing worked away stripping feathers dropped fire consumed. The plumage beautiful seemed like much wanton destruction throw away, I could help thinking delight would given I seen Uncle Dick's collection, possessor one noble birds. But uncle reasonably said, required little army porters carry chests, whole vessel take home, preserve every specimen shot. We could save finest specimens; rest must go food; course would only, obtained sufficiency particular kind, shoot required table. Ebo invaluable preparing fires food cooking, upon occasion, he placed birds sticks close hot blaze, I watched little interest, longing I begin feast. But birds take time cook, instead watching impatiently ready, I saw Uncle Dick taken his gun narrow little glade two rows trees growing regularly seemed planted gardener. But gardener ever worked here, I overtook uncle he began talk singular beautiful place without inhabitants. "The soil must rich, Nat, produce glorious trees shrubs. Look beauty flowers are, herbage, Nat. The place perfect paradise." "And feel sure, uncle, savages here?" "None ourselves, Nat," said uncle, laughing. "Well, savages, uncle," I said. "That matter opinion, boy. I am afraid birds here, think things, would much disposed look upon us savages intruding upon beautiful domain shoot one one selfish purposes." "Oh! birds cannot think, uncle," I said. "How know?" Well, course I know, could produce argument support case. So I looked last puzzled way saw he smiling. "You cannot answer question, Nat," he said. "It one matters science sees way compassing. Still, I feel certain birds good deal sense." "But do not think talk one another, you, uncle?" "No, cannot called talking; certain ways communicating one other, anyone taken notice domestic fowls see. What familiar old hen's cry her chickens she found something eatable? curious call uttered fowls large bird think bird prey flies them." "Oh! yes, I have heard that, uncle," I said. "I remember old hen uttering peculiar warning note one day field, Nat, immediately every chicken feeding near hurried hedges trees, thrust heads tufts grass hide hawk." "That seems show, uncle, understand." "Yes, certainly comprehend certain number cries, sort natural language learned preservation." "I know chickens, uncle," I said. "Sometimes go uttering little soft twittering noise happy contented; lose sight mother pipe cry stand toes, staring greatest trouble." "I think I tell another curious little thing fowls too, way communicating one other. Many years ago, Nat, I fancy keeping large fine Dorking fowls, interesting I found letting hens sit taking care chickens." "But it, uncle," I said, interrupting him, "that tiny, tender chicken easily chip hole egg-she will, nearly ready come out?" "Because, one reason, egg-she will become brittle, glutinous, adhesive matter dried away lime; reason is, pressure bird's beak alone sufficient it, pressure comes within. There wonderful strength egg, Nat, pressure without; bear enormous weight without, one particle supports another, reason pressure adds strength. The slightest touch, however, sufficient break way within. I will bound say often hammered egg spoon surprised find hard is." "Yes, uncle, often," I said. "Well, go story, Nat. One day favourite hen eleven beautiful little yellow downy chickens, fun thing I took one soft little thing nest carried yard, great cock strutting his sickle-feathered green tail glistening sun, and, putting tiny yellow ball down, I drew back, calling old cock while. "He ran up, thinking something eat; soon he reached helpless little chick he stopped short, bent his head down, looked first one eye, other, seemed lost meditation. "`Come, papa,' I said, `what think little one?' "Still he kept staring intently little thing till began cry `_Peek, peek, peek_' dismal tone, cold, old cock, looking important big, suddenly began cry `_Took, took, took_', like hen, softly crouched down, spreading his wings little chick creep get warm, doubt he would taken care chicken brought I taken back hen. "But look! talking barn-door fowls losing chances get lovely specimens foreign birds and--what is that?" For shrill wild call rang lovely glade, I thought Uncle Dick wrong, savages near. CHAPTER THIRTY ONE. LOST IN THE FOREST. There occasion alarm, cry coming Ebo, who, soon he saw us, began making frantic signs us come. "That means pigeons cooked, Nat," said uncle, laughing; case, for, soon he saw us, black came running gesticulating pointing behind direction fire, delicious birds waiting us eat. Those delightful meals shade grand wide-spreading tree, whose branches every parrot would come shrieking, followed others; ate dinner would busily find eat theirs, hanging legs, perhaps head downwards, perching one leg using soft clasping yoke toes like hand convey food towards beak. I never felt tired watching parrots paroquets, besides beauty plumage kinds soft tints green, brightened orange scarlet blue, always looked plump delicately feathered birds. I seen hundreds stuffed, admired bird-mounters' skill, never get anywhere near nature soft downy beauty bird native state. The wonder could keep prim, every feather perfect order. The paroquets, instance, central feathers tail long thin delicate, seemed that, flitting climbing trees much, must get broken, apparently never did, except damaged shot. It lovely racket-tailed kingfishers fly-catchers, tails double length bodies, delicacy beautiful extreme. But I must go back rest adventures day, soon dined rest, Uncle Dick signed Ebo he make rough hut beneath tree, ready sleeping night, leaving industriously work, started together try explore little island. Going straight could, long before, bit hill, could see blue waters ocean spreading far wide, soon made great rollers falling upon sands, spread right left, dazzling whiteness, composed entirely powdered-up coral madrepore. There need, uncle said, go farther day, found great distance across island; thing discover length. "It seems foolish thing do, perhaps, Nat," said uncle, "but I much like try little exploration to-day. I do not think shoot birds, examine land instead, little home shape, ready making trip future. We shall able mark good spots, too, finding specimens future." "But shall stay long, uncle?" I asked. "That I cannot answer, Nat," he replied, shouldered guns trudged on. "It depends upon number specimens find, far seems might travel far hit upon wild paradise." "I wonder Uncle Joe would like live here!" I said laughing. "What garden he might have, things would grow! Oh, I like help build house get garden order!" "Your Uncle Joe would happy anywhere, Nat," said uncle. "He one contented amiable men always rest; I am afraid Aunt Sophia would soon find dull, grumbling gas, pavement, waterworks, omnibuses, cabs, railroads. No, Nat, boy, Aunt Sophia would miserable here." "And yet lovely place," I cried enthusiastically. "Everything beautiful. Oh! uncle, I could stay forever." "No, Nat, could not," he replied laughing; "but beautiful same. I travelled great deal, seen wonderful scenery, I never met much beauty condensed small space." We kept walking, stop every fresh find--sometimes would curiously-shaped orchid, pitcher-plant half full dead insects. Then great forest tree full sweet-scented blossoms, alive birds insects, would arrest attention; moist hollow, tiny stream trickled rocks, would enormous tree-ferns springing twelve fifteen feet us, spreading beautiful fronds like much glorious green lace sky. A fern always beautiful object, tree-ferns beautiful--they grand. The farther went beauties found, kept noting places visit palm trees full fruit, evidently formed larder various kinds beautiful birds. We could shot enough walk kept us busy making skins days, kept determination uncle made, shoot day, except once, curious hoarse cry bird paradise, answered others distance, tempted us away. "Birds paradise exceptions, Nat," said uncle, smiling. "We must get can." I immediately seemed see beautiful bird flying amongst trees, lovely buff plumes trailing behind like much live sunshine, glancing gun see cartridges right, I crept cautiously amongst trees one side Uncle Dick made bit curve round another, good many great forest trees us, whose foliage carefully watched went cautiously on. Every then, silence made us think labour vain, give up, loud harsh cry would come echoing amongst trees, always seeming near I thought I must get shot bird moment two, I bent crept quietly I could, till tree sound seemed come reached. Then I would stand ready fire, watching carefully shot, peering amongst boughs, fancying dozen times I could catch glimpses bird amongst leaves, when, laughing pains, cry would come couple hundred yards away, chase went on. I shout Uncle Dick, stopping listen I could hear rustling leaves twigs he went on, besides every catching dim light glimpse his face. Once twice, beautiful bird sprang us, heart began beat quickly, I thought uncle tempted shoot he might hit me; degrees I grew confident walked boldly on, feeling I nothing fear. That bird must led us miles. Every time ready give up, hoarse cry rang again, followed more, feeling sure sooner later must get shot it, one others kept answering distance; last I heard peculiar whistle uncle would be, I forced way undergrowth joined him. "Nat," he said, wiping perspiration his face, "that must wild-goose instead bird paradise. Have heard lately?" "No, uncle; quite quarter hour. I think must taken longer flight time." "_Yawk, yawk--wok, wok, wok, wok, wok_," rang close behind us, fired simultaneously faint gleam seemed yellow light flitted glade, running forward get beyond smoke hope might hit it. But even able find it, eagerness pursuit come one densest parts forest found, wandering faint warm glow caused setting sun shining tree trunks, sudden dull greyness come upon us, followed almost darkness, knew lost. "I ought known better, Nat," said uncle, exclamation impatience. "I remote idea camp is, Ebo expecting us back." "Oh! never mind, uncle," I said; "let us try. I dare say find way back." "My dear boy, would sheer folly," he replied. "How possible? We tired now, would exhausting nothing, getting touch fever, go striving night." "What then, uncle?" "Do, boy? Do Adam did, make comfortable beneath tree. We better, cut wood leaves make shelter." "What, build hut, uncle?" I said dismay; I beginning find tired I really was. "No; will not take trouble; must quickly. Come along." I followed slope ground seemed trifle open trees larger, forced way uncle drew his great hunting-knife chopped straight young sapling, which, upon topped trimmed, made ten-feet pole thick arm then. This he fixed resting one end fork tree tying branch five feet ground. "Now then, Nat," he cried, "get big sheath-knife work clear ground here. Does seem dry?" "Yes, uncle, quite," I said. "Well, then, chop plenty soft twigs leaves lay thickly bed, I make roof it." We worked will, I part finding plenty tree-ferns, whose fronds capitally, Uncle Dick soon laid sloping pole sufficiency leafy branches form ample shelter wind rain either come. "So far, good, Nat," he said; "now hungry?" "I am tired hungry, uncle," I said. "Then I think light fire good night's rest can." There difficulty getting plenty dried wood together, failures began blaze merrily, lighting leaves trees rich red glow; height setting good many birds flitting strange glow, could procured specimens here. But sitting talking fire time crept leafy she would, seemed sooner I stretched I fell fast asleep. CHAPTER THIRTY TWO. ANOTHER NIGHT HORROR. I idea long I asleep I started wakefulness, feeling danger. I know danger might be, something happen I sure. It dark narrow she would, nearly dark beyond feet, faint glow fire made one two tree trunks stand like dark sentinels side. My uncle near I could wakened moving one hand, remembering night I shrank wakening without because. "I have got another fever fit coming on," I said myself; I feel so, startled timid, encourage I thought I must bad dream. But no; I could remember dream. It seemed I sunk profound sleep I wakened fancying danger. Then I lay quite still listening uncle's breathing, thinking helpless unprotected wild place, even Ebo us now. But fear, I asked I recalled uncle's words, he certain wild beasts island this, inhabitants ourselves. Yes, I could think this, ought made comfortable; no, still curious feeling danger, I felt certain I could see it, something coming attack us. Then I could neither see hear anything I began conclude I must suffering another attack fever, I lifted hand awaken uncle, he might give quinine again. Then I recollected medicine one boxes right away were, lost forest, would impossible move sun more. So I lay till another change came me, I felt sure fever again. I knew not, time mistake-- something coming forest, though I could tell. Should I waken uncle? I raised hand again, always lowered more, fearful I ridiculed; I lay thinking although uncle said certainty neither inhabitants wild beasts, plenty room either hide away forests; besides, regular inhabitants, might come canoe one islands. And, yes, I sure it, must seen fire, creeping kill us lay. This pretty theory; would make noise came, so, noise? I lay perfectly still perspiration oozing horror increasing, still noise. Yes, was--a low rustling sound one creeping bushes towards us. There could mistaking sound, I hearing afternoon crept cautiously search birds paradise. I listened tried pierce darkness eyes, embers fire anything visible, tree trunks stood like sentries. Then noise ceased I ready believe I made mistake. No, again, certainly much nearer. Should I wake Uncle Dick, I try brave enough deal danger myself? I horribly frightened sadly wanted give his help counsel; I sure, spite feelings, really danger, I fought hard cowardice determined act seemed best. Cautiously reaching hand I took hold gun, pressing finger trigger turn, I cocked silently, raising one elbow waited danger come. The sounds stopped several times, always resumed, I listened certain I felt big animal creeping great caution towards fire, though I felt animal might man. I would given anything able sit easier position; I could done making noise perhaps waking Uncle Dick nothing. So I remained I was, watching eyes ears upon strain, barrel gun towards opening leafy she would well covering fire; minute minute went by, sensation strongly upon near presence creature, one I moment expected see cross faint glow fire. Then still, though I listened intently I could hear nothing uncle's breathing. So still everything become I began feel less oppression chest, ready believe fancy, suddenly embers fire seemed fallen little together, glow grew stronger faint flicker made heart give one great bound. For there, fire, appeared monstrous figure orang-outang, crawled close fire looking it. The creature all-fours back me, darkness night prevented making properly; looked large dark coloured, I read strength creatures enormous. It crouched five yards I lay, I wondered whether I better shoot, I suddenly recollected barrels gun loaded small shot, distance, though shot would well hang together, certain make mortal wound; result would monster would fierce terrible before. I do not think I afraid fire, I hesitated, I waited I felt possibility animal aware presence, evidently fire attracted it. But hopes came end directly, I raised gun softly shoulder, creature seemed crawl towards me. This moment two though, peculiar scratching noise monster tearing bushes, I could dimly see great back waving fro. Then scratching ceased, seemed thrown twigs leaves upon fire, blazed up, gun nearly fell hand. "Ebo!" I shouted; uncle sprang crept ruddy light spread burning wood, monster shape trusty follower, dancing like mad, chattering away he pointed fire, himself, distance, seemed trying make us understand he seen fire tracked us light were. His delight seemed know bounds, whenever he came pause his performance stood grinning us, he broke again, leaping about, running away, coming back, shouting laughing he slapped loudly his hands. I compare his conduct nothing dog found his master. The question arose done, good deal sign-- making asked Ebo lead us back camp; he shook his head stamped frowned, cut matter short threw wood fire, pushed us leaf tent, lay across front, went sleep. CHAPTER THIRTY THREE. MY EARTHQUAKE. I said little uncle alarm, feeling sure he would laugh heartily mistake, I lay awake little thinking time I grew manly brave, ready frightened everything I could directly understand. It seemed shocking, too, I might cowardly fear shot poor Ebo, one best truest fellows, seemed never happy able something me. My last thoughts I went sleep I hoped I might grow brave true man, I determined try hard weak coward. I often thought since, though, ordinary man placed situation he would nervous I; awake deep sleep dark forest wild land, dangerous beasts might lurking, hear peculiar rustling noise, faint light make figure black, looking big indistinct he crept all-fours, was, put may, startling. I ready enough laugh dread I awoke morning find sun up, sending his rays long vistas trees, birds whistling, twittering, screaming loudly, every distance came hoarse cry birds paradise. "It terribly tempting, Nat," said uncle, "but I think better make straight camp get good breakfast anything else. Hallo! Ebo doing?" "Making fire," I said; directly black thrown great armful dead wood he came us laughing rubbing front his person, squeezing show empty he was, he picked stick, took aim bird, said "_Bop_!" ran pick up; coming back laughing us applaud his performance. "Well, Nat, that is piece dumb-show says plainly shoot birds breakfast anything else, would perhaps wise, come along; old friends great palm-tree." I followed uncle closely, difficulty shooting three great pigeons, Ebo pounced upon carried triumph, minutes roasting upon sticks, black cook busied climbing cocoa-tree, he detached half dozen nuts, came tremendous thud. I terribly hungry, Uncle Dick said worse stopped smelling roasting pigeons. So took guns went across opening tree tree, rising thirty forty feet high, covered beautiful white sweet-scented starry flowers, tube running like jasmine. All beautiful little birds flitting, watched time I could see feathers flash glitter sunshine, wore tiny helmets burnished gold breastplates purple glittering scales. No colours could paint beauty lovely little creatures, seemed several different kinds, patches scarlet, orange, blue, white add brilliancy feathering; little used sight man seemed pay attention us, allowed us go close, could see flit hover balance sweet-scented starry bell-flowers, whose depths thrust long thin beaks honey insects made home. I soon learned uncle sun-birds, tiny little fellows Old World humming-birds New, humming-birds East. Following Uncle Dick's example, I took shot gun, he said concussion wad would sufficient bring down. But, somehow, interested saw neither us thought firing, stood watching glittering feathers, graceful motions, rapidity tiny birds seemed flash blossom blossom, till loud yell Ebo summoned us breakfast. "Yes, Nat," said uncle, seemed read thoughts, "that way see beauty sun-birds. No stuffed specimens ever reproduce hundredth part beauty; people cannot always come England see things. Take care! What is that?" We going rather dense patch undergrowth, ground beneath soft full water, evidently boggy springs. There great deal cane tall grass, water weeds luxuriant growth, place felt hot steamy forced way through, till, I going first parting waving canes right left gun barrel, I stepped upon seemed big branch rotten tree fallen there, suddenly I felt lifted inches jerked back, moment canes grass crashed swayed, something seemed violent motion. "Is earthquake, uncle?" I said, looking aghast spot whence jerked. "Yes, Nat, goes. Fire, boy, fire!" He took rapid aim little left, canes broad-leaved plants swaying fro curious way, if, seemed then, little pig rushing through, following his example I fired direction. But shots seemed effect, whatever dashed thicker part, swampy follow even disposed. "Your earthquake got away present, Nat," said uncle. "Did see it?" "No, uncle," I said. "But must trodden upon it, threw back." "No, uncle; I trod upon trunk small tree, all." "You trod upon large serpent, Nat, boy," he exclaimed. "Ugh!" I ejaculated; I made jump back solid ground. "The danger passed now, Nat," he said, smiling dread; "but really I could believed creature existed small island." "Oh, uncle!" I cried, "I shall never like go fear treading upon another." "You soon get that, Nat, perhaps may luck shoot brute. I do not think much mischief time, though I got good sight glided amongst canes." "Why, shot guns, uncle," I cried; "we took knock sun-birds much." "Of course!" cried uncle. "How foolish remember this!" We reloaded now, then, without heeding shout Ebo, stood looking direction taken reptile, though luxuriant canes grasses quite still. "What say, Nat?" said uncle. "Shall follow monster try shoot it?" "It must forty fifty feet long, uncle," I said, feeling curious creeping sensation run me. "Forty fifty nonsenses, boy!" he said, laughing. "Such serpents exist books. They rarely exceed twenty feet largest. That fellow would fifteen. What say--will come?" "Ye-es, uncle," I said hesitatingly, feeling hot cold turns. "Why, Nat," he said quietly, "you afraid!" I speak moment two, felt hot blood flush face I stood looking full eyes, unable withdraw gaze. "Yes, uncle," I said last. "I want be, serpent horrible thing, I afraid." "Yes, horrible monster, Nat," he said quietly. "I do not like myself, could kill it--" "I cannot help feeling afraid, uncle," I said, "but I am ready go now." "What! attack it, Nat?" "Yes, uncle." "It rather dangerous, boy." "Yes, uncle," I said. "I suppose so; I want get afraid things. I am quite ready now." I looked come once, he move, stood looking minutes without speaking. "Then go attack brute, Nat," he said; "but go away bit swamp, try put little nerve hearts good breakfast, Ebo help us, unless he proves worse coward you." "He could be, uncle," I said pitifully; I felt very, miserable. "Oh! yes, he could be, Nat, boy," said uncle, smiling, grasping affectionately arm. "You coward, Nat, fought natural dread, mastered it, ready go attack beast. Master Ebo may coward fight master his dread. So see difference, boy." Another shout black made us hasten steps he dancing pointing crisp brown pigeons, big chickens, great green leaves plates, new ripe cocoa-nuts divested husks; moments I could eat thinking serpent. My fresh young appetite asserted though soon after, and, forgetting danger come, I made one delicious meals. CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR. MANY FEET OF UNPLEASANTRY. It I scraping last delicate cream inside huge cocoa-nut I recalled task come, curious shiver ran I glanced direction swamp where, nearly mile away, reptile lay. Ebo knew nothing yet, I hardly conceived he would made understand seen. "Do think he ready help kill serpent, uncle?" I said, waiting time see he would say anything attack. "I hardly know, Nat," he replied cheerily; "but we will soon try him. By way, use cartridges largest kind shot, must make morning's mistakes. Here, Ebo, we have seen snake," he said. "Ung-kul, Nat-mi-boi. Hal-lo, hal-lo hal-lo!" replied Ebo, laughing merrily, showing his white teeth. "We shall get his understanding like that," said uncle quietly; he sat thinking moment. "Shall I try draw snake, uncle?" I said. "To sure, Nat," he replied, laughing; "but paper, pencil, chalk? Stop minute--I it." We generally carried stout piece cord us, ready emergency, cord, ten yards long little thicker clothes-line, uncle untwisted his waist, he worn like belt, calling Ebo's attention he laid upon ground. Then holding one end he made wave crawl curve twine, ending knotting heap laying end carefully serpent asleep. Ebo watched process attentively, first seriously delighted, clapping his hands, dancing, chattering away telling uncle clever he was. "But show want, uncle," I said. "Well, then, try." I took rope, made undulate little, Ebo looked I gave quick twist wound round him, pretending make end bite. He took directly, pretending reptile crushing him, fighting his way free folds, picking his club attacking turn, beating make-believe head his club, finally indulging war-dance he jumped round, dragging imaginary serpent him, pretending heavy, stooping smell it, making grimace, throwing rope, he pretended bury sand. "It is right, Nat. He understands, evidently encountered big snakes. Now, then, show enemy, he fight." My uncle right, evident Ebo quite understood us meant fighting, for, sticking his spear ground, he made signs I lend hunting-knife, I did, laughing chattering away he looked little, proceeded cut sapling tree thick his arm, whose trunk he selected piece couple feet length carefully trimmed formidable club smooth, small handle, he left thick end jagged ugly places he cut branches. He long getting shape, sooner he satisfied his work he returned hunting-knife, making believe he horribly afraid lest cut his head, proceeded attack imaginary serpent trying escape bushes. Now he trying strike it, retreating, making blows upon ground, air, ending dropping his club seizing neck creature, he pretended coiled round him; he upon one knee, overthrown rolling fierce struggle; last his acting came conclusion his striking reptile's head tree, kicking imaginary coil his leg, strutting proudly show he conquered. The surprising part affair he seem slightest degree exhausted his efforts, picked his club began chattering us, pointing marsh asking us come on. "Well, Nat," said uncle, "if he fight half well encounter serpent, ought nothing fear. We ought master brute easily." "Would serpent strong, uncle?" I asked. "Wonderfully strong," he replied. "Their muscles tremendously powerful. See strength anything similar form possesses; eel, instance." "Yes, uncle," I said thoughtfully, I recalled difficult I found hold large one I caught. "Eels strong." "Look here, Nat," said uncle kindly, "I do not think run risks following serpent, one good shot would disable it; still may little perilous, expect boy age face danger. You stop back distance, I send Ebo marsh drive out, I try get shot it." "Oh, no, uncle!" I said quickly. "Come now, boy," he cried, clapping shoulder. "You going think I shall consider cowardly stay behind. I tell truly, Nat, I shall not." "I feel something kind, uncle," I said warmly; "but all. I want try brave master cowardly feelings, seems chance." He stood looking minutes, said quietly: "Very well then, Nat, shall come. But careful gun, fire unless clear shot. Do not hurry, mind Ebo near. As danger," he said, "there little. The worst thing could happen would serpent might seize you." I could help shudder. "Coil round you." The shudder felt serpent wrapping round. "And giving severe squeeze," continued uncle. "It hundred one teeth catching face, doubtful whether would penetrate clothes, even would suffer worse thorns, constricting reptiles poisonous." "It do not sound nice, uncle," I said, feeling face showing white brown sunburns. "No, Nat, not," he said; "but I told worst I may well say something side. Now chances brute try best escape, shot act; even supposing seize you, likely seize Ebo me, immediately get hold neck head knew was." "Yes, uncle, I know would," I said confidence strange thrill excitement running me. "Let come, please." "You shall, Nat," he replied; "and I will confess you, boy, I felt disappointed held back. Come along, lad, I think shall soon slay modern dragon." All time Ebo looking us wonderingly; sooner examine guns start forward, he shouldered his club went us towards piece marshy ground. I walked uncle's side gun ready, time I kept wondering he would said he known nervous I felt. The thoughts approaching seemed take brightness beauty scene, lovely could be. Strange birds flew us, glorious trees every side, covered flowers, brilliant greens various shades made want colour others. Where land seemed slope little valley, farther back ridge clothed summit beautiful vegetation. But then, poetical writer said, trail serpent all, I kept seeing imaginary reptiles' heads reared beautiful waving canes grasses, fancied I detected rustling noise made creature's scales glided dry stems. "Now," said uncle, stood last edge moist depression, "we must contrive plan attack, Nat. We must let enemy escape, he scaring us time stay." I thought kind say _us_ I know he meant _you_, I say anything, eagerly searched thickly-spread canes broad-leaved plants far I could see eyes, I could help thinking beautiful spot marsh spite serpent, two three lovely pitta thrushes flitted amidst bamboos, half dozen sun-birds darted convolvulus-like plant, kept flashing sunshine, every seemed make feathers blaze. "Now, Nat," said uncle, "I think good place you, trickling rill; see place roughly shape ham, shall place honour, boy, knuckle-bone, I Ebo go round fat sides see find enemy there." "Do think come way, uncle?" I said. "Yes, Nat, there, cool, give barrels goes by. You may depend upon one thing, reptile, comes here, trying hard escape. It attack you." I hoped Uncle Dick right, could feel sure, I remained side steep slope, bottom tiny stream trickled amongst long patch luxuriant canes I expected serpent would try escape another part island. The next minute I quite alone, obedience uncle's signs, eagerly falling his plans, Ebo ran get back little marsh, uncle also disappearing quietly side, course higher up. "Perhaps serpent will not all," I thought I stood midst profound silence; I could keep back hope within might case. Everything still, distance came hoarse cry bird paradise scream parrot, directly I seemed detect peculiar noise made hornbill, one birds flapped across little valley towards clump trees. Not sound came beyond cane swamp, slightest grasses hardly moved, stood feathery plumes bathed sunshine, strained eyes I counted knots every light-brown cream-coloured cane. I watching wavy, undulating movement, I felt sure must follow serpent creeping about; perfectly still. "It must farther top marsh he thinks," I said myself; I heard cry made blood bound veins. But nothing matter; Ebo move, I heard uncle answer him. Then beating noise black thrashing canes his club. Then heart seemed leap mouth, rustling tall grasses, something seemed forcing way through, gun shoulder I ready fire first glimpse scaly skin, feathers appeared instead, couple large wading-birds flew out. The beating went on, bird bird took flight lurking-place, beautiful; serpent appeared, I began feel bold. Still beating went on, Ebo shouting time time uncle answering, till could fifty yards me, suddenly black seemed change his tone, shouting excitedly uncle. "They have found it," I said myself; excitement I forgot fears, stood eyes sweeping cane growth ears strained utmost. All once, close noise made jump, I heard shot, followed shout Ebo, loud crashing noise, canes thrashed together big stick. Bang more, perfect silence, directly thrashing, beating noise began more, I gazed excitedly direction I heard uncle's voice. "Look out, Nat," he cried. "It is coming way." "Yolly-to, yolly-to!" cried Ebo; I hardly heard him, for, rushing amongst reeds canes, writhing bounding extraordinary way, beating, whipping tall leaves, tying knots throwing nearly straight, came seemed monstrous serpent. I ought fired, reptile came towards I felt I must run, I turned fled dozen yards shame stopped me, I faced about. The creature close hand, writhing horribly, leaving behind beaten track, fit desperation I raised gun, took quick aim, fired, leaped aside get away smoke, fired something close me. The next moment I knocked down, gun flying hand, I struggled serpent gone. "Hurt, Nat?" cried uncle, came running Ebo, began feel over. "I do not think I am, uncle," I said angrily; "but thing gave horrible bang." "Pick gun come along, lad. You hit brute barrels, I know I once. Come along; load run." Ebo already gone serpent's track, I sent blow reptile writhed fiercely, straightened out, gone straight little valley towards open ground. "Obe-ally-yolly!" shouted Ebo, running I found serpent gliding rapid way amongst tall trees, black darting hitting his club time time, apparently without making impression. "Stand back, Ebo," cried uncle, waving black away, then, Ebo leaped back, preparing fire. But he lowered his gun I came up. "No," he said, "you shall give _coup de grace_, Nat;" feeling fear I finished loading gun went among trees. "Fire head, Nat," cried uncle; easy see it, creature kept twining wonderfully rapid way; last I caught head came behind tree trunk, fired, monster leaped ground fell back long straight line, perfectly motionless, till Ebo darted give final thump his club, when, astonishment, blow seemed electrify creature, drew series waves, kept throbbing end end. "Shall I fire again, uncle?" I said excitedly. "No, Nat," he replied; "it would slaying slain. Bravo, boy! capitally." "But I ran away first, uncle," I said sorrowfully. "I stop serpent first came out." "It enough make Saint George run away dragon, Nat," he said laughing. "I could believed serpent existed isles. Let us see long he is." "Thirty feet, uncle," I cried excitedly. "Your eyes magnify morning, Nat," he said merrily. "No, boy," he continued, pacing along writhing creature's side; "that serpent barely fourteen feet long, wonderfully thick size, proves must animals would form prey." "Shall skinned, uncle?" I asked. "Yes," he replied, handing his knife Ebo, readily understood wanted, leaving his nasty job, uncle I went search birds paradise. CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE. ANOTHER FISHING TRIP. We long tramp birds paradise day, get one. We shot lovely sun-birds though, couple thrushes seen before. Our walk took us well sight sea more, began pretty good idea form island. But went uncle satisfied matter time make glorious collection birds eastern islands. We saw four different kinds birds paradise walk, though get one account shyness, despair getting that; last, well tired out, returned Ebo, hung serpent's skin dry, following his guidance till nightfall got back hut sea-shore, boat lay perfectly safe, tired make fire cook, lay fell asleep once. It still dark I awakened hand shaking arm, and, starting up, black face Ebo bent me. "Ikan-ikan," he kept repeating. "Ikan--fish," said uncle, starting up. "Yes, may well get change, Nat;" minutes sand launching boat, rode lightly rollers. We plenty fishing-lines, fine Ebo shook his head them, proceeded show us easily would break; trying without success, cutting his hands, he grinned jumped dance, evidently thinking room he settled began examine hooks glittering tin baits box. These he scanned carefully boat skimmed along, uncle steering, trying sharpness hooks he performed always seemed conjuring trick, bringing couple mother-of-pearl baits his waist-cloth, roll twine. The savages East, fact eastern people, wear cord round waist made material accordance station. The poorer people cotton twisted grass, wealthier chiefs silk, threaded gold. This thin cord used support waist-cloth, rarely taken off, fastened tightly I seen appear completely buried flesh, wearers idea ought make look much like insect possible. Ebo wore tight _lingouti_--as called--round he tucked coarse cotton cloth formed his article attire, means cotton cloth he performed I spoken like conjuring tricks, somehow another, although he appearance carrying nothing him, he always collection useful articles stored away folds waist-cloth. Upon present occasion he brought two mother-of-pearl baits would used attract fish real bait could obtained. It sight see Ebo comparing his pearl baits specimens tin tinned copper, time he seemed he could hardly make his mind better. Then he laid his coil line made roughly twisted grass beside ours, inspected two carefully, he uttered sigh put his away, evidently quite satisfied civilised article far better. We sailed mile anchored edge reef coral, acted shelter great rollers broke far away upon edge, seeming make ridge surf, lay undulating calm, tide running strongly reef, water fathom deep growing shallower moment moment. Ebo laid his short club ready his hand, signing draw big hunting-knife place beside me. "That looks catch large dangerous fish, Nat," said uncle; he drew his knife passing us line artificial baits affixed. "Will not fish, uncle?" I asked. "No, boy. You two fish, soon catch one cut bait. I do not believe artificial bait get real." By time Ebo thrown his line I followed his example, seeing swift current seize upon bait carry rapidly reef, twinkling sparkling water I jerked paying line. All once, fifteen yards away. I felt jerk snatch. "I have got one," I said; tugging ceased directly, I felt fish gone. Either same, though, another seized directly, fierce tug cut hand, I give line moments fish I hooked darted like lightning, I side soon after, gazed delight, was, lay panting boat, like magnificent goldfish, five six pounds weight, bars across side dazzling blue. "Poo--chah--chah!" Ebo cried face full disgust he twisted his line round peg boat, seizing his club battered fish death unhooking it, threw side, where, carried away, I could see dozens fish darting it, tearing pieces fast could. "What for?" I cried angrily, seemed wasting splendid fish. Ebo chatted away reply, almost angrily, which, evidently satisfied I understand, he behaved nastily, though his dumb-show comic made us roar laughter. For he pretended eat, supposed, fish. Then he jumped up, sat down, jumped again, rubbed his front, kicked his legs shouted, making hideous grimaces he pain, ending leaning side boat, pretending horribly sick, finishing his performance lying down, turning his eyes, moaning. "We must take he shows us granted, Nat," said uncle, Ebo jumped smiling, much say, "Was not I clever?" "These people know wholesome unwholesome fish; I going use fellow bait." Just Ebo hooked brought fine fish blue, even one would do, he killed tossed overboard, chattering he abusing bad. We saw scores fish dart thrown in, bit freely artificial baits occasion change. I hold seemed nice fish directly, letting run little I began hauling in, watching progress shallow clear water thinking bright beautiful looked brilliant corals, softly waving weeds every shade brown scarlet, fish darted it. All I uttered cry astonishment, long line undulating creamy white seemed dart fish, seize jerk, twist round it, till fish eel-like creature attacked resembled knot. I kept hauling in, slowly now, fear hook break out, weight double water lashed glittering foam. "What it, uncle?" I cried excitedly. "Do not hurry, Nat," he replied; Ebo, busy pulling fish notice line, threw again, fastening his cord came side see. No sooner he make I end line he seized his club, gesticulated furiously, began beating side boat, chattering aloud, signing give line. "Let it, Nat," said uncle. "He experience things." I gave hold fishing-line unwillingly, little adventure intensely exciting, every jerk drag made creature seized fish sent thrill arms heart. "It kind sea-snake taken fish, Nat, regularly constricting it. As I told before, dangerously poisonous, like great friend swamp." Meanwhile Ebo jerking shaking line furiously, endeavouring get rid snake, without avail, held tightly, evidently got one fold twisted round line, I must confess, hearing poisonous nature creatures, feeling rather nervous behaviour brought board. But Ebo mean bring board. He wanted shake off, struggles fish writhing twisting snake, seemed every moment line must break. The black brought close in, let go almost full length line, jerked it, made fierce snatches, vain; last getting unwelcome visitor close in, he signed uncle take his knife he raised his club blow, sudden cessation rush, foam water, fish snake gone. Ebo grinned triumph, examining bait threw again, returning side directly draw satisfactory fish breakfast, uncle chatted last captive. "This new me, Nat," he said. "I never could thought snakes eels, seem partake character latter, would wound round prey seized. The elongated fish part world, congers, dog-fish, guard-fish, similar creatures, fasten teeth prey, setting bodies rapid motion like screw, regularly cut great pieces victim. This precisely serpent prey, natural history fact worth recording. But look!" I already felt fish snap bait, checked it, knew I fast monster. For moments he let feel something heavy inert end line, plunge rush, line went hissing out, try I would check it, fish ran straight till I dragged might, felt either line must break hands would terribly cut. "Give take, Nat," cried uncle. "It is give, uncle, I cannot take bit." I hardly said words I liberty take much I liked, fish gone, upon drawing line terribly disappointed way, find fish completely bitten strong wire gimp, broken it, bitten cleanly done knife. "That must monster," said Uncle Dick. "But never mind, boy. Here, hold still I will loop another bait." He act Ebo began dance boat, striving hard drag fish he hooked. His plan haul quickly he could, never giving fish moment's rest, form playing swift, darting creature seem enter his head. He seemed found his match time, fish refused dragged board, fierce struggle black's arms much it, dozen rapid hand-over-hand hauls resulted hauled side, sharp-nosed glittering silver-fish four feet long, I fling upon hold stop frantic leaps amongst tackle, Ebo uttered cry alarm, darted me, attacked fish his club, dealing furious blow upon head, apparently without effect, one blows fell, great fish seemed make side dart head, jaws closed upon club, holding fiercely power Uncle Dick cut head club could wrenched away, Ebo showed creature's jaws full teeth like lancets pretty well sharp. "No wonder wire bitten through," said uncle. "Hallo! he good eat?" Ebo evidently seemed consider not, fish thrown over, fierce monster, must perfect tyrant waters, floated dozen feet furiously attacked literally hacked pieces. There difficulty getting fish morning, thing avoid hooking monsters would break bite tackle, good food. The reef literally swarmed fish, large, small, every could see rapid dash one snake-eels I called them. I saw regularly leap water sometimes come knot, twisting twining extraordinary way, last, interesting clear, shallow water, laid aside lines leaned side gazing fish flashed about, till reef dry, leaving Ebo boat landed walk shining weeds coral, picking way amongst she will-fish endless variety, great heavy shells couple feet long, small delicate I handle greatest delicacy keep crushing tissue-papery shells. I could stayed hours filled boat wonders. There scarlet orange coral, beautiful I bringing away specimens; Uncle Dick showed gelatinous covering lovely tint, this, he told me, would soon decay. Then brilliantly tinted weeds. There sea-slugs too, delicacies amongst Chinese name _trepang_, many wonders sea I gone searching amongst crevices sharp coral, I sharp warning given make boat parts inch two deep rapidly increasing foot, uncle shouting come aboard. It quite time, I distance boat, tide flowing rapidly minutes I swim, swim water swarming furious kinds finny tribe anything tempting. As I swim strokes, course soaked, uncle hauled uninjured boat I little minded wetting, laughed adventure sat breakfast feasted upon frizzled fish hearts' content. CHAPTER THIRTY SIX. EBO SATISFIES OUR WANTS. It would tedious I go describing almost endless varieties birds shot, glowing though rainbow colours, keep repeating skinned preserved sun-bird, pitta, trogon, lovely rose-tinted dove. Parrots cockatoos found without number, selected finest specimens, collection rapidly increased, fast, indeed, steady work, I began understand uncle brought great number West. But still one great objects visit part world achieved; shot birds paradise; scarce things England time I write. There plenty rough specimens plumage worn ladies' bonnets; fair, well-preserved skin hardly known, brought England roughly dried natives; last uncle declared birds shot skinned obtained specimens least lovely creatures whose cries often heard us, tantalisingly kept shot. It difficult task, last made Ebo understand must shoot birds, his way he seemed indicate told sooner might many liked. That day he obtained good little store provisions, shouldered his spear, went himself, saw forty-eight hours, he came back unconcerned way, he never sight, sat ate put him. After he lay went sleep hours, waking ready dance around us, chattering vehemently finished skins preserving, he signed us take guns follow him. We obeyed him, he seem satisfied collected provision well, he set off, taking us part island visited before, and, anything, beautiful had. It long journey he took us, could secured hundreds brilliantly coloured birds, shot large ones, knew good food, ready halt camp fire, seemed return hut night. Over hillsides, valleys tree-ferns sprang up, beautifully laced fronds, great groves palms clumps cocoa-nut trees, whose fruit Ebo climbed got us, still went on, avoiding marshy-looking spots experience taught us home serpents, which, small numbers, inhabited isle. Several times looked inquiringly Ebo, he smiled pointed forward, followed till he stopped suddenly showed us wood ready making fire. Here welcome rest hearty meal, he let us stay long, hurrying us forward, till, sundown, he brought us dense patch forest, huge trees towering upward spreading branches, making impenetrable shade. "It dark travel far to-night, Nat," said uncle. "Where he mean go? But ought place birds paradise, Nat, get any." Just Ebo stopped, found rough hut leaves bed fern already waiting us, part his work his prolonged absence. His delight knew bounds he saw pleased, usual he indulged dance, he caught us turn arm tried hard explain birds paradise plentiful here. We tired think anything much besides sleep, gladly crept hut, sleep soundly without single thought serpents huge apes, I seemed hardly closed eyes, felt exceedingly grumpy indisposed move Ebo began shaking get up. "All right!" I said, then, I lay still eyes closed, Ebo kept on: "Hawk, hawk, hawk; kwok, kwok, kwok;" seemed stupid him, again; "Hawk, hawk, hawk; kwok, kwok, kwok." "Come, Nat," cried uncle; "unbutton eyelids, boy, get up. Do not hear birds calling?" "I thought Ebo, uncle," I said. "Oh! I sleepy." "Never mind sleepiness, Nat. Come along let us see cannot get good specimens." Just I saw Ebo's face opening, cutting yawn right half I followed uncle darkness, though birds paradise calling, sign day. But wished success I felt must get beneath trees unseen, and, examining gun, I followed uncle, turn kept close behind Ebo. The black went forward cautiously, looking strange misty darkness; he evidently knew he about, going along amongst great tree trunks without sound, followed lightly could. On sides could hear hoarse cries birds, felt must good numbers, I felt less sleepiness fresh morning air, curious feeling excitement came I thought lovely amber plumes birds, wondered whether I fortunate enough bring one down. All Ebo stopped beneath enormous tree, crept close mighty trunk gazed darkness could catch glimpse star; fact, black it, cries various birds heard, might taken middle night. There nothing see almost opaque blackness, though I fancied I could make great branch crossing head. It seemed nonsense come, loud cry one birds sought, sounded loudly silenced doubts. I raised gun ready shot, could see nothing. Just uncle whispered his lips ear: "Do not make sound, do not fire till good chance. Look out." The loud quok, quok, quok, answered distance, repeated heads, whistle wings plainly heard solemn silence forest, repeated overhead till seemed beneath tree birds paradise met discussion, like rooks home elms. But matter I strained eyes I could distinguish single bird. The minutes went by, I longed light, though I knew would betray presence, still I might catch sight one bird bring down. But light come, arms ached holding gun I lowered it, patiently waited heart beating heavily, I listened cries increase. All I felt arm glide shoulder, I could make Ebo pointing upward his black finger steadily one direction. I tried follow could see nothing, I thinking much better savage's sight ours, darkness came hoarse "_Hawk, hawk, hawk; quok, quok, quok_," cry seemed direct eye, I fancied I could see something moving slightly great height, bowing strutting like pigeon. I looked looked could see it; star peeping leaves seemed suddenly hidden, movement again. I forgot uncle's orders firing I good chance, taking steady aim dimly seen spot hoarse cry arose more, I drew trigger. The flash gun seemed cut blackness, report went echoing away amongst trees; sharp rustling noise, dull, quick thud, I spring forward seek I shot, Ebo's arms closed round held fast. I understood he meant, contented reloading gun, click lock sounding loud silence ensued, report gun caused complete cessation cries, I felt get shots time; I heard rush wings flock birds taking flight, I wondered whether still dense top tree. Five ten minutes must elapsed, Ebo's arm glided shoulder rested there, I laid cheek it, gazed quite another direction till I fancied I saw he pointing at, looked like nothing dark spot high amongst twigs; fact, I make I felt sure nest. But I recalled accurate Ebo before, taking aim, making careful leaning gun barrel trunk tree, I fired; quick rustle leaves twigs, another dull thud, one moved. After minutes' waiting Ebo pointed another, whatever was, I still doubt whether birds paradise I shot, silence broken since I fired first. I took quicker aim time drew trigger, heavy fall branches, magic seemed daylight, I saw several big birds dotted tree. Uncle Dick I fired together, came rush wings another bird fell, loud cries repeated distance; Ebo, evidently considering use wait, ran pick birds. Only one bird fallen uncle I fired together, I believe I missed; Ebo I picked result expedition sun rose, bright light came trees stood gazing ecstasy lovely creatures. "Oh, uncle!" That I could say time. "I think ought `Oh, Nat!'" he replied laughing. "Why, young dog, eyes have! got luck." "Oh no, uncle," I said laughing; "I shot Ebo's eyes." "Then next time I will same," he said. "But let us go shoot more," I said excitedly. "No, Nat, shall get to-day. I suppose hiding darkness beneath trees frequent shall success. They wonderfully shy, wonder plumage protect." I suppose people seen specimens great bird paradise, conception beauty freshly shot specimen two I brought down. I felt I could never tire gazing wonderful tinting bird, pale straw yellow feathers short stiff like velvet, rich chocolate neck covered scales metallic green. Their tails seemed have, place centre feathers, couple long beautiful curving wires nearly yard long; chief beauty birds great tuft plumage seemed come beneath wings, light soft, quite two feet long, rich golden orange. It seems impossible conceive lovely bird, took triumph hut, breakfasted, uncle afterwards carefully making skins four. The two evidently younger birds, full plumage, beautiful formed splendid addition collection. CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN. BEAUTIES IN PLUME. Our work done, uncle decided stay couple days least, even afterwards come round side island, good fortune yet end. In taking look round, towards mid-day heard harsh cry, means little stalking Uncle Dick got within shot brought bird almost beautiful shot daylight. This shorter plumes rich red, two long double curved wires tail, upper plumage plush-like richer colours. The metallic green vivid, golden yellow colour bright upon neck shoulders. Almost directly I shot big dull brown bird gave satisfaction all; Uncle Dick delighted, saying female bird kind shot, decided red bird paradise. Even come end good fortune, passing hundreds sun-birds, pittas, trogons, glad meet short time back, uncle suddenly raised his gun fired seemed be, I stood, couple sturdy-looking starlings. One fell, Uncle Dick shouted second bird came direction. I made quick shot darting among bushes, brought down, running pick I found I shot something entirely fresh me. "Well done, Nat!" cried uncle. "Mine hen bird. What lovely little creature, sure! It gem." "What it, uncle?" I said. "Evidently paradise bird, boy." It curious little short-tailed fellow, wonderful colours; centre dumpy tail sprang two wires six inches long, formed two flat spiral curls end, intense green. Instead long plumes birds shot before--birds three times size this--it wing little tuft grey, tipped green, bird could set like tiny tans. The whole upper surface rich red, part glistening floss-silky glass-thready white, relieved bands patches metallic green. There shades orange crimson here, I add bird's legs delicious blue, beak orange yellow like blackbird's, realise beautiful creature I shot. "There, Nat," said uncle, "we more, carefully preserve treasures got." But hardly he spoken he fired brought another bird, wonder. It seemed size last, entirely different, though sufficiently similar mark paradise bird. It nearly short tail, two central wires crossed, instead forming beautiful curves flat disc end, wires ended point curled round form circle. The prevailing colours orange, buff, yellow, great peculiarity couple ruffs capes feathers hanging back neck, upper one pale yellow, lower reddish-brown. Uncle Dick great state delight I, pleasure seemed reflected upon Ebo, showed his satisfaction brought us place, shouldering his spear striding one hand upon his hip, proud his position companion white man. The time glided fast stay island, found plenty fruit, many fish liked catch, abundance large pigeons birds help larder. The climate hot, breezes came sea always seemed modify heat make bearable. Several storms occurred, trees bent fury blast, waves piled sands high weeds shells. The lightning terrific thunder deafening. At times awful, curious scared feeling used first come me. But I soon grew used storms, soon over, took little notice them, except enjoy delicious freshness air seemed afterwards make everything ten times beautiful before. It would become wearisome I kept writing beauty different varieties birds paradise found, lovely tinting arrangement plumes; let sufficient I tell scarcely day passed without Ebo finding fresh specimen us shoot, dancing round delight boy skinned preserved new treasure. Sometimes beetle day, sometimes butterfly day, collecting loveliest specimens; birds formed principal pursuit, cases began present goodly aspect packed carefully well-dried aromatic skins. I one two slight touches fever, uncle poorly once, he skilfully treated us disease soon mastered, trouble passed over. Taken altogether, though, found island, spite heat, delightful place residence, feelings real regret I sat swift boat one day big sail set, skimming smooth sea, stores board, Uncle Dick helm steering due north, bidden beautiful island farewell, shores beginning grow distant eyes. CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT. EBO DOES NOT APPROVE OF NEW GUINEA FOR REASONS THAT APPEAR. It seem matter Ebo went long he us. He must man five-and-thirty, he brave lion--as lion said story, reality he great sneak--but Ebo seemed heart boy. He ready laugh I did, sit I ill tired, his face full sympathy, sooner I better signal triumphal dance. Ebo happy could be. It matter going, he laughed chattered pointed fish skimmed shallow water coral reefs, sometimes approaching islands whose names know, apparently small chart; whatever temptations might hold uncle steered right due north, evening second day land stretching east west far could see. "Now, Nat," he cried, "where geography? place that?" "I say must New Guinea, uncle," I said. "Quite right, boy. Hallo! what is matter Ebo?" That gentleman lying bottom boat fast asleep past three hours, he sit bear company part night; woke caught sight land he seemed become furious. Having us long, he picked good many words, picked good many his, help signs got along pretty well. But quite startling see his excitement. He seemed agitated he could recollect word _no_, he kept repeating he dashed left me, run uncle, seizing tiller trying drag round alter direction boat. "No, no, no, no, no!" he cried. Then pointing land he came me, caught his spear, I thought he going kill me, he made savage thrust went right past arm; dropped spear, caught his club, forced back head gunwale boat, raised his club made believe beat death, hammering boat side his might. After he made sham attack upon uncle, who, however, took coolly, laughed seeing attack upon me, though I noticed one hand go his gun Ebo made spear. After black worked perspiration, instead of, I expected, bursting laughing, he kept pointing land, crying, "No, no, no!" then, "Kill bird, kill man, Nat, mi boy, kill Ung-kul Dit; kill Ebo. No, no, no!" "You mean savages kill us land?" I said. "Kill, kill," he cried, nodding his head excitedly, banging side boat his club; "kill, kill, kill. Kill Ebo, kill Nat, mi boy, kill Ung-kul Dit, kill boat, kill, kill. No, no, no!" "Well done, Ebo!" cried uncle laughing. "Your English splendid. Good boy." "Ebo, good boy," cried black. "No, no, no. Kill, kill." "They shall not kill us, Ebo," said uncle, taking his gun pointing shore; while, make his meaning clearer, I same. "Shoot--kill man." "Shoot! kill!" cried Ebo, evidently understood, he picked his spear, thrust fiercely towards shore. "Yes, shoot; kill man," he continued, nodding his head; he seemed much dissatisfied gazed intently towards distant land. "He seems know character New Guinea savages, Nat," said Uncle Dick. "I always heard fierce cruel set, shall soon see whether safe land." We sailed gently on, turned glorious moonlight night, altering course little sunrise within couple miles seemed beautiful country, wooded shore, rising inland towering mountains. Great trees seemed prevail everywhere, saw sign human being. "The place looks tempting, Nat," said uncle, "and hit upon uninhabited part I expect find capital specimens cases. Let us see place like." Ebo tried his fashion dissuade us going farther, evident poor fellow terrible uneasy boat run close shore, dozen nude black savages came running water's edge, making signs us land, holding bunches bright feathers rough skins birds. "They look friendly, Nat," said uncle. "Look here; I land take presents beads brass wire; shall soon see mean mischief." "I will come you, uncle," I said. "No; stop boat keep her afloat. Here guns ready loaded. I do not suppose danger; is, must pepper enemy small shot keep back--that is, course, see attack me." "Had not I better come, uncle?" "No; I shall take Ebo. They may simple-hearted friendly others met, country must grand collecting ground I cannot afford scared away may false reports raised people behaved ill natives." He took strings brightly coloured beads little roll brass wire, waved air, savages shouted kept making signs us land. We twenty yards sandy shore now, could see every expression face New Guinea men, uncle threw one leg side stood his knees clear water. "Kill Ung-kul Dit," said Ebo, clinging his arm. "No, no! Come," replied uncle. Ebo's club already his _lingouti_, picking his spear he leaped water, I sat boat barrel gun resting gunwale sail flapped boat rocked softly fro. The people seemed delighted uncle waded in; I noted carefully avoided wetting feet, keeping dry sand talking eagerly among themselves; though I looked attentively I could see sign arms. So peaceful good-tempered look I completely thrown guard, wondered Ebo could cowardly keep yard behind uncle, walked fearlessly, held his hand string beads. The New Guinea men chattered seemed delighted, holding hands catching eagerly beads, snatching giver's hands, asking apparently more. I saw Uncle Dick sign he wanted birds exchange. They understood him, held two three skins, he advanced step take them; snatched back directly, and, magic, savages thrust hands behind them, instant man flourishing war-club. It seemed happen moment, heart seemed stand still I saw one treacherous savage, six feet high, strike uncle head his club, poor uncle falling he killed. It I saw Ebo held back behind uncle, fortunate faithful fellow followed guidance his reason. For as, midst tremendous shouting yelling, tall savage bent forward strike uncle I saw Ebo's lance point strike throat, he went down. This checked savages instant, long enough enable black stoop get good grip Uncle Dick's collar his left hand, his right he kept making darts his spear yelling savages kept striking clubs. So tremendous true Ebo's thrusts I saw another great black go down, couple run yelling back towards dense cover come; Ebo critical position. My uncle heavy, black hard work drag sand towards boat, keep his enemies bay. It I saw brave warrior chief follower must be; I also saw his enemies formed half circle trying get behind cut boat. For first moments I felt helpless; I determined leap go help; I saw I best I was, took aim, ready fire first chance, I could nothing first fear injuring friends. And besides, horrible feeling compunction come upon thought fire men--fellow creatures--and I shrank drawing trigger. At last, though, I saw hesitation would fatal. Ebo making brave defence, wounded several his assailants he dragged uncle water's edge. Another step he could waded, easily dragging uncle water, his enemies made savage dash, one boldest got hold his spear. Another moment he would struck down, when, hesitating longer, I took quick aim fired right thick black group far one side uncle I could. As report rang out, stinging shot hissed scattered, injuring several, uttered fierce yells separated moment, giving better chance fire again, I effect savage dragging Ebo's spear loosed his hold, turned, ran his life. It golden moment black friend, made couple darts his freed weapon, backing rapidly drew uncle water towards boat. The savages staggered shot gun. Many wounded, trifling small shot-wounds, infuriated saw prey escaping, rush came tearing water, whirling clubs heads yelling furiously. My blood now, brief moments I saw fate, massacred treacherous ruthless wretches, made offerings peace good-will. I seemed see battered boat, friends home waiting news sailed peaceful expedition, news would never come; curious pang came I felt I must save Uncle Dick his brave defender I could. I already picked uncle's loaded double gun, two rifles also loaded ready hand, so, taking careful aim foremost savage crew pressing Ebo hard, I fired. I could see moment smoke, parted I saw men close enough shot much serious effect. Two fallen, moment's hesitation others made fresh rush, I met another shot, checked again; though another man fell, half dozen streaming blood, seemed infuriate came on. I even like use fatal rifles, found time cram couple cartridges, time Ebo dragged uncle boat, stooped, lifted in, one hand upon gunwale kept shoving her off, backing wading, thrusting his spear fierce wretches came savagely ever. The boat moved slowly, I hot excitement now, I fired savage striking Ebo, group, dull heavy thud war-club thrown clever aim struck full forehead, I fell senseless bottom boat. CHAPTER THIRTY NINE. EBO'S SONG OF TRIUMPH. When I came to, terrible pain head, misty feeling taken savages, laid war-dance triumph around me. "Hi, yi, yi--Hi, yi, yi--Hi, yi, yi!" Then kept shrill tone till seemed, head ached badly, almost maddening. At last I raised heavy eyelids saw instead lying sand surrounded savages, I distance shore boat. I could dimly see, mist, savages beach, shouting, yelling, threatening us war-clubs; Ebo apparently dance bottom boat, keeping abominable "Hi, yi, yi!" his song triumph victory he won. "Hi, yi, yi--Hi, yi, yi--Hi, yi, yi! _hey_!" The _Hey_! accompanied tremendous jump, flourish spear savages shore, defiance seemed madden rushed furiously waving clubs yelling might. Sometimes dashed water right chests, swam war-clubs teeth, went pantomime supposed beaten pounded jelly upon shore. All delighted Ebo, varied his war-song making derisive gestures, showing his utter contempt his cowardly enemies, seemed sting fury, I began wonder get canoes. For boat floating gently along sixty yards shore sail flapping about, current driving her away, rollers carrying her in. At first I could nothing sit gaze, sometimes Ebo, sometimes savages. Then sleepy stupid way I looked uncle, lying bottom boat his eyes closed perfectly motionless. Somehow state trouble much, I wished head would ache quite badly. I quite aware danger, seemed quite natural; last I began wonder I begin something, uncle get up. At last seemed occur Ebo time finish shouting, he laid his spear down, came me, lifted me, head side boat, he scooped cool water bathed face, satisfactory effect I able think clearly; thanking him, I perform similar duty uncle, when, horror, I saw crowd savages running couple canoes sands, evidently launch them, finish treacherous work begun. For moments I felt paralysed, recovering I made sign Ebo, hoisted great sail fullest height, boat careened I hurried aft tiller sail began slowly fill, boat move gently water. But never moved slowly before, breeze light, seemed savages must get canoes launched, paddled us could get speed. They saw this, kept shouting working might, moving first one canoe edge water, launching them, springing in, next moment air black paddles. Again instant sea foaming vigorous strokes. But fact canoes large heavy took time get well motion, must overtaken, wind seemed playing sail, one moment filling out, next letting flap idly boat rose fell upon waves. Seeing I could I fastened tiller piece cord rapidly reloaded guns, Ebo picking his spear, and, horror, beginning shout deride savages. It would made little difference, I suppose, blacks would killed us without mercy overhauled us, seemed certain do, paddling steadily well, blades plunged water greatest regularity, making foam sparkle swept along. So fast seem come, uttering chorus sort war-cry plunge paddles, I wondered overhaul us, slowly seem move, last, got canoes full swing, came hand hand, getting near men bows made ready spears hurl, I raised gun, meaning make brave end I could. I much excited feel frightened now. I suppose time, thoughts turned upon acts savages, one threw spear, fell short. I took aim him, fire, thinking I would reserve shot till greater danger, hoping couple well-directed charges might effect deterring pursuit. But still came abreast, evident meant attack side poor little boat, looked small beside long war-canoes, contained forty men. They uttered loud yell now, boat seemed stand still sail began flap, and, somehow, then, I felt dreadful danger in, I began thinking Clapham Common, running sunshine, Uncle Joe looked blandly on, evidently enjoying pursuits. Just half dozen spears thrown, I nearly fell overboard, saving making snatch one stays. It I struck spear, boat given leap bent till seemed she would capsize. In fact she would gone her sail flat upon water I eased sheet she went slipping waves tremendous rate. It work moments, I turned head see canoes double distance behind, savages paddling furiously; I saw wind held, case like pet spaniel running greyhound, boat kept careening literally racing sea. In five minutes I found canoes far behind fear, and, altering course sail gently mile shore, I gave Ebo sheet hold, knelt down, bathed Uncle Dick's face, bound great cut laid open his head. My work reward, for, partly freshness water, partly pain I must caused him, uncle revived, stared wildly minutes, then, he realised position, he muttered little himself, ended shaking hands Ebo, holding black palm latter his moments, he looked follower face. "I much blame, Nat," he said last. "I ought guarded; I could think people treacherous." CHAPTER FORTY. WE SECURE FRESH TREASURES. Our injuries soon grew better, though kept sailing days days past tempting-looking spots, never dared land, always soon neared gloriously-wooded track, hill, dale, mountain, amidst whose trees glasses showed us plenty birds, inhabitants began cluster shore, twice uncle said would go nearer see, custom invariably observed: people came shouting dancing beach holding birds bunches feathers shells, making signs us land. There need Ebo grow excited cry, "No--no! man-kill! man-kill!" uncle laughed shook his head. "They must try another way baiting traps, Nat," he would cry laughing. "My head sore blows memories caught again." It always same. No sooner treacherous savages find would land rushed canoes, began pursue us howling yelling; swift-sailed boat always ready leave far behind, glad find pleasant brisk breezes stood friends. "I would loiter here, Nat," he said, "amidst treacherous, bloodthirsty set, great island tempting I long ramble amongst forests. I know plenty wonderful specimens obtained here. New kinds paradise birds, butterflies, beetles, attractions would sin obtain." "Perhaps shall find place bye inhabitants, uncle," I said. "That I hoping days," he replied; long sailed round headland beautiful bay whitest sand, trees clustering amidst lovely yellow stone cliffs, bright stream water flowing gorge tumbling two three little barriers rocks losing calm waters bay. Some six seven miles back high ridge mountains, seemed touch sea east west, cutting narrow strip mainland, strip, fifteen miles long six wide greatest, fertile extreme. "Why, Nat," cried uncle, "this grand place island. If free savages beau ideal naturalist's station. Look! what is that?" "A deer come wood drink stream," I said. "Poor deer," laughed uncle, "I am afraid come larder, bit venison thing want." As he spoke he cautiously took rifle, rested upon edge boat, waited moments, fired fully five hundred yards' distance, I saw deer make one great bound fall dead. "Good! Eatum," said Ebo approvingly; instead indulging frantic dance he shaded his eyes gazed every direction, carefully sweeping shore, paying heed us boat sailed close in. As keel checked sand Ebo leaped out, I thought he rush deer skin food, he ran rapidly one direction right along shore, coming back end quarter hour, which, dragging prize board, remained, gun hand, upon watch. Ebo started went direction, away longer time, returning triumphant indulge dance, help drag boat place safety proceeding light fire. Venison steaks followed, another exploration found thoroughly uninhabited part island built hut slept ashore perfectly undisturbed. The next morning another exploration, find that, uncle supposed, ridge mountains cut us rest island, finding nothing fear set work. Parrots profusion, great crowned pigeons; latter becoming poultry table. There abundance, though, birds large size, whose skins care preserve, which, fruit-eaters, delicious roasted. Then another deer two; caught fish bay; literally revelled bounteous supply fruit. Meanwhile working industriously specimens, finding paroquets quite new us, splendid cockatoos, ugly curious. Sun-birds, pittas, lovely starlings, kingfishers, beautifully-tinted pigeons abundance. Bright little manakins vivid green there, feathered put mind rich orange cock-of-the-rocks Uncle Dick brought Central America. Sometimes shooting beside lovely trickling stream gathered pools form tiny waterfalls, places birds seemed love come. At others, beneath great flower-draped tree, sun-birds hovered darted. But great objects search, birds paradise, haunted nut berry bearing trees. Some always found kind palm attracted pigeons well, latter swallowing fruit looked big heads. Here, intense delight, shot paradise oriole, magnificent orange, yellow, black bird, head looking covered lovely orange plush. One day made longer excursion usual, successful turn back, long afternoon's work us preserve specimens. We penetrated right mountainous ridge, finding ground rise rapidly came standstill, peculiar cry amongst tree-shadowed rocks us made us forget fatigue, especially Ebo making signs. The cry different heard felt must new bird, full eagerness set work stalk it. All seemed flash dark blue darted tree, gun could reach shoulder gone. But Ebo watch, away he crept amongst rocks trees, following took prize, till saw quarter mile away holding his spear signal. We followed cautiously, look intelligence his eyes he signed uncle go one way towards clump tall palms, go direction. "Fire upwards," whispered uncle, parted. I knew Ebo's ways bird must one trees, eyes sweeping great leaves directions I tried make bird, vain, I advanced near I gave hope seeing it, suddenly side shot, another, feeling satisfied uncle secured prize I completely taken guard, stared astonishment large bird, tail quite couple feet long, swept towards dense undergrowth lower ground, would vain hunt it. Just, however, bird darting trees I raised gun made quick snapshot quite sixty yards' distance, called stupid ready wasting charge powder shot. My uncle hailed now. "Any luck, Nat?" he cried, he came up. "No, uncle," I replied. "I made flying shot, far-off." "So mine, Nat, I fired chance getting bird. It bird paradise different I seen. We must come again. I never chance it." "But I did, uncle," I said dolefully, "and missed it." "Where fired?" "Down among trees, uncle. I let go far." "Why, hit it, Nat! There is Ebo." I looked, intense delight black companion holding bird triumph. He seen fall I shot, marked down, found amongst dense undergrowth, placing us hardly feather disarranged. It splendid bird, last shot New Guinea, three feet long, tail two lovely bluish tint. If looked one side bronze, green, light fell, sides sprung magnificent plumes rich blue green. They long, filmy plumes like great bird paradise, short, widening towards end, standing like couple fans wings. It feast gaze upon lovely object creation, I felt proud secured specimen bird I shot before. "Well, Nat Naturalist," cried uncle, he carefully hung bird beak stick, "I think I right bringing me." "I glad think so, uncle," I said. "I mean it, boy, invaluable me. It worth risk coming savage place get bird that." "There must plenty wonderful birds here, uncle," I said, "if could stop safety." "I sure are, Nat, nothing I like better stay here. It regular naturalist's hunting-ground full treasures, dared thoroughly explore it." "Just now, uncle," I said, "I feel I want nothing else sit rest good dinner. Oh! I fagged!" "Come along, then," he said smiling, "and make straight camp, I dare say manage good repast lordship. Home, Ebo. Eat--drink--sleep." "Eat--drink--sleep," said Ebo nodding, he knew three words meant, carefully carrying treasures shot, tied regular distances along stick, he trudged advance towards hut upon shore. CHAPTER FORTY ONE. OUR TERRIBLE LOSSES. We three miles go could flown like birds; way lay rocks, quite little precipice descend times, journey must double length. The hope good meal, however, made us trudge on, stops rest I saw must nearing shore, ground much level. So different appear, though, I hardly recognised it, Ebo I sure gone astray; but, savage like, he seemed unerring instinct finding his way back ground he before, look back front point way greatest confidence. We trudging front, talking low tone making another expedition mountainous part, hope finding it, higher climbed, free risk meeting natives, getting near shore could hear beat waves upon reef lay hut, sheltered boat washed about, sudden, traversing low, scrubby bushes thorny pleasant, Ebo suddenly struck us shoulder, forcing us amongst leaves twigs, looking sharply round saw he dropped splendid specimens, and, wild-eyed excited, he crouching too. "Why, Ebo," began uncle; black clapped his hand upon his mouth, pointed shore front. I felt blood turn cold; there, fifty yards away, dimly seen shade leaves, party fifty New Guinea men, couple dozen three canoes lying outside reef. They fierce-looking lot, armed spears, axes, clubs, gesticulating chattering fiercely boat. I heard uncle utter groan, seemed labours months upon months collecting wasted, specimens, stores, arms, everything value, would fall hands savages. He perfectly calm directly after, crouched his gun ready chance, necessity use; he knew useless attempt fight, could save lives. After half hour's talk savages embarked, taking boat tow behind one canoes, saw bright water flash paddles beat regularly, men sent craft along till swept round headland west bay gone. "Oh, uncle!" I cried, soon safe. "It hard, Nat, boy," he said sadly; "but might worse. We lives little ammunition; scoundrels wrecked expedition." "And boat, uncle." "Nor anything else, Nat," he said cheerfully. "But plenty pluck, boy, Ebo help us make canoe take us Moluccas, I dare say I get merchant fit us again. Well, Ebo," he cried, "all gone!" "Man--kill--gone," repeated Ebo, shaking his spear angrily, he kept repeating word Owe--boat, went shore. "Let us see left anything hut, Nat," said uncle. "We must food even stripped." We turned bushes made way little arbour-like spot beside stream Ebo built hut beneath splendid tree, when, utter astonishment, found savages seen little home, caught sight boat, landed carried off, without attempting look owners. No one since left, evident; pleased were, delight equalled Ebo's, laying specimens, time carefully, he refreshed dance lighting fire, capital meal prepared, thankfully enjoyed thought benefits received forethought carry everything boat placing cover fear rain. The savages taken nothing boat, next thing set work construct another, uncle said he feel satisfied stay longer, without means retreat ready emergency. Before lying managed ask Ebo he thought able build canoe would carry us luxuries. For reply he laughed, pointed axes trees, say, What foolish question material here! I wearied, slept heavily, I awakened uncle long sun up. "Come, Nat," he said, "I want make fire. Ebo gone somewhere." I made fire, hasty breakfast, worked hard skin making--preserving specimens. The day glided by, Ebo come, feeling disposition collect more, fact caring fire, look round see would likely place cut tree begin building boat. "It lucky us, Nat," said uncle, "that Ebo belongs nation boat-builders. Perhaps he gone search suitable place kind wood he thinks best; I wish he would come." Night fell Ebo. The next morning he there; day day glided set work search him, feeling sure poor fellow must fallen precipice lying helpless forest. But success, began think wild beasts, though seen nothing large enough dangerous, except worst wild beast all, savage man. Still searched beginning conclude he must seen passing canoe whose occupants landed carried off. "I do not think would, uncle," I said, though; "he sharp cunning. Why, would like seeking catch wild bird try get hold Ebo, he woods." "Perhaps right, Nat," said uncle. "There one way, though, never tried, I mean mountain beyond shot last bird. To-morrow go across see signs poor fellow. If see none must set work build canoe hollow one tree, I tremble, Nat, result." "Shall able make one big enough carry chests, uncle?" "No, Nat, I do not expect it. If contrive one carry us port must satisfied. There I buy boat, must come back stores." We devoted next two days long expedition, merely using guns procure food, reluctantly allowing several splendid birds escape. But expedition produced weariness; footsore worn returned hut, fully determined spend time trying could contrive shape boat, falling fast asleep, sad heart indeed, Ebo felt lost faithful friend. CHAPTER FORTY TWO. AN EXPERIMENT IN BOAT-BUILDING. "It use down-hearted, Nat," said uncle next morning. "Cheer up, lad, let us look difficulties face. That is way overcome them, I think." "I feel better morning, uncle," I said. "Nothing like good night's rest, Nat, raising spirits. This loss boat follower, he lost, two great misfortunes, must bear mind hardly anything success attended us." "Except savages, uncle," I said. "Right, Nat: except savages. Now let us go shore good look sea." We walked close water, satisfied canoes sight, made fire, coffee soon getting hot, I roasted big pigeon, food never seemed tire, supply abundant seemed matter course shoot two three wanted meat. "I would give something, Nat," said uncle, sat soft, delicious sea air, sunshine coming like silver rays glorious foliage heads--"I would give something, Nat, boat-building formed part education." "Or gone learned it, like Peter Great, uncle." "Exactly, boy. But not, must set work see do. Now say? How make boat?" "I have thinking great deal, uncle," I said, "and I wondering whether could make bark canoe like Indians." "A bark canoe, eh, Nat?" "Yes, uncle. I have seen model one, looks easy." "Yes, boy, things look easy; men make them, savages though be, work experience many generations. It took hundreds years make good bark canoe, Nat, I am afraid first manufacturers useful little vessel drowned. No, Nat, could make canoe kind." "Then must cut big tree hollow out, uncle, take long time." "Yes, Nat, suppose try medium way. I propose cut moderately-sized tree, hollow lower part boat, drive pegs along edge support, weave basket-work cane sides high want it." "But could make sides watertight, uncle?" I said; "there seem pine-trees get pitch turpentine." "No, Nat, gum found large quantities earth, discover any. The Malays called _dammar_, use largely torches. It strikes could turn splendid varnish, seeing hard resinous substance is. Ebo would found soon, I doubt." "Then I must find without him, uncle," I said. "I shall go hunting whenever I busy boat-building." He smiled enthusiasm, examining skins see dry free attacks ants, took hatchet guns, proceeded along side shore search stout straight tree combine qualities light, strong, easy work, growing near sea. We quite came conclusion great deal labour, learn experience kind tree would suitable, perhaps cut several found one would do. "And bad, uncle," I said. "It us great deal labour, Nat," he replied smiling; "but make us handy hatchets." "I mean that, uncle," I replied; "I thinking savages coming direction seeing chips cut-down trees." "To sure, Nat, right. That bad; cut rest island, must hopeful may get work done come." We spent four days hunting found tree possessed qualities required. We found dozens would done, far away shore, would difficult move boat afterwards water's edge. But tree selected offered us thick straight stem twenty feet long, placed land sloped easily towards sea, sufficiently removed beach us go work unseen. We set cut down, finding great delight soon bark wood firm fibrous, yet easy cut, six hours' steady chopping made big gap side, obliged leave dark. We worked next day next, uncle leaned I gave cuts, went crash amongst trees, ready working shape required. Next morning soon light began cut top length intended boat, task saved labour chopping branches. I worked hard, labour made lighter Uncle Dick's pleasant conversation. For he chatted savage civilised man, laughingly pointed latter gone improving. "You see slow laborious work chipping axes is, Nat," he said one day, kept industriously on, "when means cross-cut saws circular saw worked steam tree could soon reduced thin boards ready building boat." Birds came perched near us, rare kind, felt must leave alone secure obtained, worked patiently till end week tree began wear outside somewhat shape boat, length required. It terribly hard work, shrink, last, congratulating upon got far without interfered savages, shouldered guns walking back hut one evening caught sight black figure running across opening, knew time safety end. "It I always feared, Nat," said uncle quickly. "Quick; put big-shot cartridges gun. We spill blood help it, lives ours, must get safely back home." "What shall now?" I said huskily. "Wait see enemy mean do, and--" "Hi, yi, yi--Hi, yi, yi--Hi, yi, yi. Hey. Nat, mi boy. Ung-kul!" came shrilly trees. "Hooray!" I shrieked, leaping hiding-place. "Ebo! Ebo! Hi, yi, yi--Hi, yi, yi. Hooray!" We ran meet him, he bounded towards us, leaping, dancing, rolling ground, hugging us, seeming half mad delight he dragged us sea-side, new surprise awaited us. For upon shore, her anchor fixed sands, lay boat apparently quite uninjured. As Ebo danced patted boat himself, plain enough read his disappearance. He gone along shore following savages village, watched his opportunity sail off. And he course done, placing boat safely old moorings. He made signs something eat, I noticed he looked thin; evident poor fellow suffered terrible privations getting back treasure, proving good friend. CHAPTER FORTY THREE. FAREWELL TO A FRIEND. "Do not feel disappointed, Nat?" said uncle smiling. "We shall able finish boat." "I shall get it, uncle," I said. "Hallo! what is matter Ebo?" For he half finished eating he jumped made signs us understand, began drag one chests towards boat. "I see, Nat; he means safe stay," said uncle; setting work got treasures safely board, food fruit ready, filled water barrel, paused. But Ebo satisfied; he chattered excitedly signed us launch boat. "I will take his advice," said uncle. "He means savages may pursuit." So, pushing off, sail hoisted, bright starlight glorious night sailed away, carefully avoiding reef, rollers breaking heavily, half mile shore Ebo pressed arm pointed. "Only time, Nat," said uncle. "What escape!" For there, stealing cautiously along us white sandy shore, counted five large canoes, whose occupants paddling softly make noise, Ebo's sharp eyes would passed us unseen. We doubt going boat, half hour sooner fate would sealed. As see tall sail swept us swiftly along, time sun rose brightly sea far enough away danger look upon another trouble passed. We ran two three times found inhabitants obtained birds fruit; dangerous task afterwards contented fish, cooked upon sandy spot reef coast clear, could seen savages great distance, leave plenty time escape. My uncle turned boat's head south reluctantly last, mystery temptation vast isle New Guinea attractive. The birds insects collected were, them, quite new science, he used say he could stayed long enough specimens would invaluable. Still impossible, danger great, besides, he said, nearly three years away home time reached England, would wisest course make sure obtained. In due time sailed Ebo's island, found captain prahu board come, been, sailed more, would months could see again. Under circumstances, Ebo's great delight, left chests specimens sealed hut, felt would quite safe, then, Ebo guide, sailed Ceram, large island, able purchase stores, Moluccas, better. At places made many expeditions, collecting birds insects, lovely; want novelty them, uncle said, ground often visited before. And last sailed south Ebo's island, finding stores specimens quite safe sound, spending days sunning repacking them. By time captain prahu arrived, ready welcome us warmly, he afraid ill befallen us. He could stay long, chests placed board, last nothing take farewell Ebo, true-hearted fellow, whose dejected look went heart. He cheered little uncle gave four new axes, many pocket-knives, residue beads brass wire, remaining odds ends bought barter; all, gift sent fit dancing boat, complete was. At first he seemed think he give us something exchange, consequently he began fetch sorts treasures, he considered them. When last, though, he knew present, his delight knew bounds, he danced sang joy. The next morning said good-bye, last I saw poor Ebo he stood his boat watching us waving his spear, I am ashamed say tears stood eyes I wondered whether I ever see true, generous fellow again. CHAPTER FORTY FOUR. HOME AGAIN. It bright sunny day July uncle I jumped cab bade man drive us old house, I passed many happy well unhappy days. "We stop go see barbers dress, Nat, go take surprise," said uncle; first time I began wonder whether I altered. "Am I much sunburnt I used be?" I said suddenly, drew near door. "Well, quite black," he said laughing, "but altered, Nat, since saw last." How heart beat walked front door, maid, stranger, stared us, said her mistress out, looked suspiciously us, evidently, she afterwards owned, taking us sailor fellows parrots silk things sale. "Where is Uncle Joseph?" I said sharply. "Oh, please, sir, Master Nathaniel, who is far away sea?" she cried. "I Nathaniel," I said laughing, "but I am far away sea. Where is Uncle Joe?" "He is garden, sir, smoking his pipe tool-house," said girl smiling; I dashed drawing-room, jumped steps, ran well-remembered spot, find dear old Uncle Joe sitting treasures carefully dusted otherwise untouched; I stood behind clapped hands his eyes, he poor old Humpty Dumpty him. "Who--who is that?" he cried. "Guess!" I shouted. "I--I cannot guess," he said. "I do not know you. Let go I shall call help." "Why, Uncle Joe!" I cried, taking away hands clasping his. He stared top toe, last said trembling voice: "You are boy Nat?" "But indeed I am, uncle," I cried. "My boy Nat _was boy_," he said nervously, "not big six-foot fellow gruff voice, and--my dear Dick. Why, then, Nat all." The old man hugged his arms, ready she would weak tears, Uncle Dick followed looking on. "Why, why, why--what him, Dick?" cried Uncle Joe excitedly. "Here, he cannot Nat, he got man's voice, he bigger me, he nearly black. Why, here is Sophy-- Sophy, dear, who is this?" I caught her arms kissed her, she stared surprise, I suppose I altered wonderfully, though busy life travel I taken little note change. It pleasant settle quiet sort specimens, tell Uncle Joe dangers land sea; time, although Aunt Sophia kind different she old, came strong feeling upon times I like wandering amidst beautiful islands Eastern Seas, watching wondrous beauties world beneath shallow waters, glorious greens trees upon tropic shores. The boy loves nature goes loving nature end, I may say Uncle Dick spoke truth he said I ought called Nat Naturalist, I feel I Nat Naturalist still. "Uncle Dick," I said one day, "shall ever another trip together collecting birds?" "Time proves things, boy," he said; "wait see."
