 TREASURE ISLAND PART ONE--The Old Buccaneer 1 The Old Sea-dog Admiral Benbow SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, rest gentlemen asked write whole particulars Treasure Island, beginning end, keeping nothing back bearings island, still treasure yet lifted, I take pen year grace 17__ go back time father kept Admiral Benbow inn brown old seaman sabre cut first took his lodging roof. I remember yesterday, he came plodding inn door, his sea-chest following behind hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling shoulder his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged scarred, black, broken nails, sabre cut across one cheek, dirty, livid white. I remember looking round cove whistling he so, breaking old sea-song he sang often afterwards: “Fifteen men dead man’s chest-- Yo-ho-ho, bottle rum!” high, old tottering voice seemed tuned broken capstan bars. Then he rapped door bit stick like handspike he carried, father appeared, called roughly glass rum. This, brought him, he drank slowly, like connoisseur, lingering taste still looking cliffs signboard. “This handy cove,” says he length; “and pleasant sittyated grog-shop. Much company, mate?” My father told no, little company, pity. “Well, then,” said he, “this berth me. Here you, matey,” he cried man trundled barrow; “bring alongside help chest. I will stay bit,” he continued. “I am plain man; rum bacon eggs I want, head watch ships off. What mought call me? You mought call captain. Oh, I see you are at--there”; he threw three four gold pieces threshold. “You tell I have worked that,” says he, looking fierce commander. And indeed bad his clothes coarsely he spoke, he none appearance man sailed mast, seemed like mate skipper accustomed obeyed strike. The man came barrow told us mail set morning Royal George, he inquired inns along coast, hearing well spoken of, I suppose, described lonely, chosen others his place residence. And could learn guest. He silent man custom. All day he hung round cove upon cliffs brass telescope; evening he sat corner parlour next fire drank rum water strong. Mostly he would speak spoken to, look sudden fierce blow his nose like fog-horn; people came house soon learned let be. Every day he came back his stroll he would ask seafaring men gone along road. At first thought want company his kind made ask question, last began see he desirous avoid them. When seaman put Admiral Benbow (as did, making coast road Bristol) he would look curtained door he entered parlour; he always sure silent mouse present. For me, least, secret matter, I was, way, sharer his alarms. He taken aside one day promised silver fourpenny first every month I would keep “weather-eye open seafaring man one leg” let know moment he appeared. Often enough first month came round I applied wage, he would blow his nose stare down, week he sure think better it, bring four-penny piece, repeat his orders look “the seafaring man one leg.” How personage haunted dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On stormy nights, wind shook four corners house surf roared along cove cliffs, I would see thousand forms, thousand diabolical expressions. Now leg would cut knee, hip; he monstrous kind creature never one leg, middle his body. To see leap run pursue hedge ditch worst nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear monthly fourpenny piece, shape abominable fancies. But though I terrified idea seafaring man one leg, I far less afraid captain anybody else knew him. There nights he took deal rum water his head would carry; he would sometimes sit sing his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; sometimes he would call glasses round force trembling company listen his stories bear chorus his singing. Often I heard house shaking “Yo-ho-ho, bottle rum,” neighbours joining dear life, fear death upon them, singing louder avoid remark. For fits he overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand table silence round; he would fly passion anger question, sometimes none put, he judged company following his story. Nor would he allow anyone leave inn till he drunk sleepy reeled bed. His stories frightened people worst all. Dreadful stories were--about hanging, walking plank, storms sea, Dry Tortugas, wild deeds places Spanish Main. By his account he must lived his life among wickedest men God ever allowed upon sea, language he told stories shocked plain country people almost much crimes he described. My father always saying inn would ruined, people would soon cease coming tyrannized put down, sent shivering beds; I really believe his presence us good. People frightened time, looking back rather liked it; fine excitement quiet country life, even party younger men pretended admire him, calling “true sea-dog” “real old salt” like names, saying sort man made England terrible sea. In one way, indeed, he bade fair ruin us, he kept staying week week, last month month, money long exhausted, still father never plucked heart insist more. If ever he mentioned it, captain blew his nose loudly might say he roared, stared poor father room. I seen wringing his hands rebuff, I sure annoyance terror he lived must greatly hastened his early unhappy death. All time he lived us captain made change whatever his dress buy stockings hawker. One cocks his hat fallen down, he let hang day forth, though great annoyance blew. I remember appearance his coat, he patched upstairs his room, which, end, nothing patches. He never wrote received letter, he never spoke neighbours, these, part, drunk rum. The great sea-chest none us ever seen open. He crossed, towards end, poor father far gone decline took off. Dr. Livesey came late one afternoon see patient, took bit dinner mother, went parlour smoke pipe his horse come hamlet, stabling old Benbow. I followed in, I remember observing contrast neat, bright doctor, his powder white snow his bright, black eyes pleasant manners, made coltish country folk, all, filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow pirate ours, sitting, far gone rum, his arms table. Suddenly he--the captain, is--began pipe his eternal song: “Fifteen men dead man’s chest-- Yo-ho-ho, bottle rum! Drink devil done rest-- Yo-ho-ho, bottle rum!” At first I supposed “the dead man’s chest” identical big box his upstairs front room, thought mingled nightmares one-legged seafaring man. But time long ceased pay particular notice song; new, night, nobody Dr. Livesey, I observed produce agreeable effect, he looked moment quite angrily he went his talk old Taylor, gardener, new cure rheumatics. In meantime, captain gradually brightened his music, last flapped his hand upon table way knew mean silence. The voices stopped once, Dr. Livesey’s; he went speaking clear kind drawing briskly his pipe every word two. The captain glared while, flapped his hand again, glared still harder, last broke villainous, low oath, “Silence, there, decks!” “Were addressing me, sir?” says doctor; ruffian told him, another oath, so, “I one thing say you, sir,” replies doctor, “that keep drinking rum, world soon quit dirty scoundrel!” The old fellow’s fury awful. He sprang his feet, drew opened sailor’s clasp-knife, balancing open palm his hand, threatened pin doctor wall. The doctor never much moved. He spoke before, his shoulder tone voice, rather high, room might hear, perfectly calm steady: “If put knife instant pocket, I promise, upon honour, shall hang next assizes.” Then followed battle looks them, captain soon knuckled under, put his weapon, resumed his seat, grumbling like beaten dog. “And now, sir,” continued doctor, “since I know there is fellow district, may count I will eye upon day night. I am doctor only; I am magistrate; I catch breath complaint you, it is piece incivility like tonight’s, I will take effectual means hunted routed this. Let suffice.” Soon after, Dr. Livesey’s horse came door he rode away, captain held his peace evening, many evenings come. 2 Black Dog Appears Disappears IT long occurred first mysterious events rid us last captain, though not, see, his affairs. It bitter cold winter, long, hard frosts heavy gales; plain first poor father little likely see spring. He sank daily, mother I inn upon hands, kept busy enough without paying much regard unpleasant guest. It one January morning, early--a pinching, frosty morning--the cove grey hoar-frost, ripple lapping softly stones, sun still low touching hilltops shining far seaward. The captain risen earlier usual set beach, his cutlass swinging broad skirts old blue coat, his brass telescope his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I remember his breath hanging like smoke his wake he strode off, last sound I heard he turned big rock loud snort indignation, though his mind still running upon Dr. Livesey. Well, mother upstairs father I laying breakfast-table captain’s return parlour door opened man stepped I never set eyes before. He pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers left hand, though he wore cutlass, he look much like fighter. I always eye open seafaring men, one leg two, I remember one puzzled me. He sailorly, yet he smack sea too. I asked his service, he said he would take rum; I going room fetch it, he sat upon table motioned draw near. I paused I was, napkin hand. “Come here, sonny,” says he. “Come nearer here.” I took step nearer. “Is table mate Bill?” he asked kind leer. I told I know his mate Bill, person stayed house called captain. “Well,” said he, “my mate Bill would called captain, like not. He cut one cheek mighty pleasant way him, particularly drink, mate Bill. We will put it, argument like, captain cut one cheek--and we will put it, like, cheek’s right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, mate Bill house?” I told he walking. “Which way, sonny? Which way he gone?” And I pointed rock told captain likely return, soon, answered questions, “Ah,” said he, “this will good drink mate Bill.” The expression his face he said words pleasant, I reasons thinking stranger mistaken, even supposing he meant he said. But affair mine, I thought; besides, difficult know do. The stranger kept hanging inside inn door, peering round corner like cat waiting mouse. Once I stepped road, he immediately called back, I obey quick enough his fancy, horrible change came his tallowy face, he ordered oath made jump. As soon I back he returned his former manner, half fawning, half sneering, patted shoulder, told I good boy he taken quite fancy me. “I son own,” said he, “as like two blocks, he is pride ’art. But great thing boys discipline, sonny--discipline. Now, sailed along Bill, would not stood spoke twice--not you. That never Bill’s way, way sich sailed him. And here, sure enough, mate Bill, spy-glass his arm, bless his old ’art, sure. You me’ll go back parlour, sonny, get behind door, we will give Bill little surprise--bless his ’art, I say again.” So saying, stranger backed along parlour put behind corner hidden open door. I uneasy alarmed, may fancy, rather added fears observe stranger certainly frightened himself. He cleared hilt his cutlass loosened blade sheath; time waiting he kept swallowing he felt used call lump throat. At last strode captain, slammed door behind him, without looking right left, marched straight across room his breakfast awaited him. “Bill,” said stranger voice I thought he tried make bold big. The captain spun round his heel fronted us; brown gone his face, even his nose blue; he look man sees ghost, evil one, something worse, anything be; upon word, I felt sorry see moment turn old sick. “Come, Bill, know me; know old shipmate, Bill, surely,” said stranger. The captain made sort gasp. “Black Dog!” said he. “And else?” returned other, getting his ease. “Black Dog ever was, come see his old shipmate Billy, Admiral Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, seen sight times, us two, since I lost two talons,” holding his mutilated hand. “Now, look here,” said captain; “you have run down; I am; well, then, speak up; it?” “That is you, Bill,” returned Black Dog, “you are right it, Billy. I will glass rum dear child here, I have took liking to; we will sit down, please, talk square, like old shipmates.” When I returned rum, already seated either side captain’s breakfast-table--Black Dog next door sitting sideways one eye his old shipmate one, I thought, his retreat. He bade go leave door wide open. “None keyholes me, sonny,” he said; I left together retired bar. For long time, though I certainly best listen, I could hear nothing low gattling; last voices began grow higher, I could pick word two, mostly oaths, captain. “No, no, no, no; end it!” he cried once. And again, “If comes swinging, swing all, say I.” Then sudden tremendous explosion oaths noises--the chair table went lump, clash steel followed, cry pain, next instant I saw Black Dog full flight, captain hotly pursuing, drawn cutlasses, former streaming blood left shoulder. Just door captain aimed fugitive one last tremendous cut, would certainly split chine intercepted big signboard Admiral Benbow. You may see notch lower side frame day. That blow last battle. Once upon road, Black Dog, spite his wound, showed wonderful clean pair heels disappeared edge hill half minute. The captain, his part, stood staring signboard like bewildered man. Then he passed his hand his eyes several times last turned back house. “Jim,” says he, “rum”; he spoke, he reeled little, caught one hand wall. “Are hurt?” cried I. “Rum,” he repeated. “I must get away here. Rum! Rum!” I ran fetch it, I quite unsteadied fallen out, I broke one glass fouled tap, I still getting way, I heard loud fall parlour, running in, beheld captain lying full length upon floor. At instant mother, alarmed cries fighting, came running downstairs help me. Between us raised his head. He breathing loud hard, his eyes closed his face horrible colour. “Dear, deary me,” cried mother, “what disgrace upon house! And poor father sick!” In meantime, idea help captain, thought he got his death-hurt scuffle stranger. I got rum, sure, tried put his throat, his teeth tightly shut his jaws strong iron. It happy relief us door opened Doctor Livesey came in, his visit father. “Oh, doctor,” cried, “what shall do? Where he wounded?” “Wounded? A fiddle-stick’s end!” said doctor. “No wounded I. The man stroke, I warned him. Now, Mrs. Hawkins, run upstairs husband tell him, possible, nothing it. For part, I must best save fellow’s trebly worthless life; Jim, get basin.” When I got back basin, doctor already ripped captain’s sleeve exposed his great sinewy arm. It tattooed several places. “Here is luck,” “A fair wind,” “Billy Bones his fancy,” neatly clearly executed forearm; near shoulder sketch gallows man hanging it--done, I thought, great spirit. “Prophetic,” said doctor, touching picture his finger. “And now, Master Billy Bones, name, we will look colour blood. Jim,” he said, “are afraid blood?” “No, sir,” said I. “Well, then,” said he, “you hold basin”; he took his lancet opened vein. A great deal blood taken captain opened his eyes looked mistily him. First he recognized doctor unmistakable frown; his glance fell upon me, he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, he tried raise himself, crying, “Where is Black Dog?” “There Black Dog here,” said doctor, “except back. You drinking rum; stroke, precisely I told you; I just, much will, dragged headforemost grave. Now, Mr. Bones--” “That is name,” he interrupted. “Much I care,” returned doctor. “It is name buccaneer acquaintance; I call sake shortness, I say this; one glass rum will not kill you, take one you will take another another, I stake wig do not break short, you will die--do understand that?--die, go place, like man Bible. Come, now, make effort. I will help bed once.” Between us, much trouble, managed hoist upstairs, laid his bed, his head fell back pillow he almost fainting. “Now, mind you,” said doctor, “I clear conscience--the name rum death.” And he went see father, taking arm. “This nothing,” he said soon he closed door. “I drawn blood enough keep quiet awhile; he lie week he is--that best thing you; another stroke would settle him.” 3 The Black Spot ABOUT noon I stopped captain’s door cooling drinks medicines. He lying much left him, little higher, he seemed weak excited. “Jim,” he said, “you are one that is worth anything, know I have always good you. Never month I have given silver fourpenny yourself. And see, mate, I am pretty low, deserted all; Jim, you will bring one noggin rum, now, will not you, matey?” “The doctor--” I began. But he broke cursing doctor, feeble voice heartily. “Doctors swabs,” he said; “and doctor there, why, he know seafaring men? I places hot pitch, mates dropping round Yellow Jack, blessed land a-heaving like sea earthquakes--what doctor know lands like that?--and I lived rum, I tell you. It is meat drink, man wife, me; I am rum I am poor old hulk lee shore, blood’ll you, Jim, doctor swab”; he ran curses. “Look, Jim, fingers fidges,” he continued pleading tone. “I cannot keep  them still, I. I have not drop blessed day. That doctor’s fool, I tell you. If I do not dram rum, Jim, I will horrors; I seen  them already. I seen old Flint corner there, behind you; plain print, I seen him; I get horrors, I am man lived rough, I will raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one glass would not hurt me. I will give golden guinea noggin, Jim.” He growing excited, alarmed father, low day needed quiet; besides, I reassured doctor’s words, quoted me, rather offended offer bribe. “I want none money,” said I, “but owe father. I will get one glass, more.” When I brought him, he seized greedily drank out. “Aye, aye,” said he, “that is better, sure enough. And now, matey, doctor say long I lie old berth?” “A week least,” said I. “Thunder!” he cried. “A week! I cannot that; they would black spot then. The lubbers going get wind blessed moment; lubbers could not keep got, want nail another’s. Is seamanly behaviour, now, I want know? But I am saving soul. I never wasted good money mine, lost neither; I will trick  them again. I am afraid  them. I will shake another reef, matey, daddle  them again.” As he thus speaking, he risen bed great difficulty, holding shoulder grip almost made cry out, moving his legs like much dead weight. His words, spirited meaning, contrasted sadly weakness voice uttered. He paused he got sitting position edge. “That doctor’s done me,” he murmured. “My ears singing. Lay back.” Before I could much help he fallen back his former place, he lay silent. “Jim,” he said length, “you saw seafaring man today?” “Black Dog?” I asked. “Ah! Black Dog,” says he. “_He’s_ bad ’un; there is worse put on. Now, I cannot get away nohow, tip black spot, mind you, it is old sea-chest they are after; get horse--you can, cannot you? Well, then, get horse, go to--well, yes, I will!--to eternal doctor swab, tell pipe hands--magistrates sich--and he will lay  them aboard Admiral Benbow--all old Flint’s crew, man boy,  them that is left. I first mate, I was, old Flint’s first mate, I am on’y one knows place. He gave Savannah, he lay a-dying, like I now, see. But will not peach unless get black spot me, unless see Black Dog seafaring man one leg, Jim--him all.” “But black spot, captain?” I asked. “That is summons, mate. I will tell get that. But keep weather-eye open, Jim, I will share equals, upon honour.” He wandered little longer, his voice growing weaker; soon I given his medicine, he took like child, remark, “If ever seaman wanted drugs, it is me,” he fell last heavy, swoon-like sleep, I left him. What I done gone well I know. Probably I told whole story doctor, I mortal fear lest captain repent his confessions make end me. But things fell out, poor father died quite suddenly evening, put matters one side. Our natural distress, visits neighbours, arranging funeral, work inn carried meanwhile kept busy I scarcely time think captain, far less afraid him. He got downstairs next morning, sure, his meals usual, though he ate little more, I afraid, his usual supply rum, he helped bar, scowling blowing his nose, one dared cross him. On night funeral he drunk ever; shocking, house mourning, hear singing away his ugly old sea-song; weak he was, fear death him, doctor suddenly taken case many miles away never near house father’s death. I said captain weak, indeed he seemed rather grow weaker regain his strength. He clambered stairs, went parlour bar back again, sometimes put his nose doors smell sea, holding walls he went support breathing hard fast like man steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me, belief he good forgotten his confidences; his temper flighty, allowing his bodily weakness, violent ever. He alarming way he drunk drawing his cutlass laying bare table. But that, he minded people less seemed shut his thoughts rather wandering. Once, instance, extreme wonder, he piped different air, kind country love-song he must learned his youth he begun follow sea. So things passed until, day funeral, three of the clock bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I standing door moment, full sad thoughts father, I saw someone drawing slowly near along road. He plainly blind, he tapped stick wore great green shade his eyes nose; he hunched, age weakness, wore huge old tattered sea-cloak hood made appear positively deformed. I never saw life dreadful-looking figure. He stopped little inn, raising his voice odd sing-song, addressed air front him, “Will kind friend inform poor blind man, lost precious sight his eyes gracious defence his native country, England--and God bless King George!--where part country he may be?” “You Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, good man,” said I. “I hear voice,” said he, “a young voice. Will give hand, kind young friend, lead in?” I held hand, horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless creature gripped moment like vise. I much startled I struggled withdraw, blind man pulled close single action his arm. “Now, boy,” he said, “take captain.” “Sir,” said I, “upon word I dare not.” “Oh,” he sneered, “that is it! Take straight I will break arm.” And he gave it, he spoke, wrench made cry out. “Sir,” said I, “it I mean. The captain he used be. He sits drawn cutlass. Another gentleman--” “Come, now, march,” interrupted he; I never heard voice cruel, cold, ugly blind man’s. It cowed pain, I began obey once, walking straight door towards parlour, sick old buccaneer sitting, dazed rum. The blind man clung close me, holding one iron fist leaning almost his weight I could carry. “Lead straight him, I am view, cry out, ‘Here is friend you, Bill.’ If do not, I will this,” he gave twitch I thought would made faint. Between that, I utterly terrified blind beggar I forgot terror captain, I opened parlour door, cried words he ordered trembling voice. The poor captain raised his eyes, one look rum went left staring sober. The expression his face much terror mortal sickness. He made movement rise, I believe he enough force left his body. “Now, Bill, sit are,” said beggar. “If I cannot see, I hear finger stirring. Business business. Hold left hand. Boy, take his left hand wrist bring near right.” We obeyed letter, I saw pass something hollow hand held his stick palm captain’s, closed upon instantly. “And that is done,” said blind man; words he suddenly left hold me, incredible accuracy nimbleness, skipped parlour road, where, I still stood motionless, I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping distance. It time either I captain seemed gather senses, length, moment, I released his wrist, I still holding, he drew his hand looked sharply palm. “Ten of the clock!” he cried. “Six hours. We will yet,” he sprang his feet. Even he so, he reeled, put his hand his throat, stood swaying moment, then, peculiar sound, fell his whole height face foremost floor. I ran once, calling mother. But haste vain. The captain struck dead thundering apoplexy. It curious thing understand, I certainly never liked man, though late I begun pity him, soon I saw he dead, I burst flood tears. It second death I known, sorrow first still fresh heart. 4 The Sea-chest I LOST time, course, telling mother I knew, perhaps told her long before, saw difficult dangerous position. Some man’s money--if he any--was certainly due us, likely captain’s shipmates, two specimens seen me, Black Dog blind beggar, would inclined give booty payment dead man’s debts. The captain’s order mount ride Doctor Livesey would left mother alone unprotected, thought of. Indeed, seemed impossible either us remain much longer house; fall coals kitchen grate, ticking clock, filled us alarms. The neighbourhood, ears, seemed haunted approaching footsteps; dead body captain parlour floor thought detestable blind beggar hovering near hand ready return, moments when, saying goes, I jumped skin terror. Something must speedily resolved upon, occurred us last go forth together seek help neighbouring hamlet. No sooner said done. Bare-headed were, ran gathering evening frosty fog. The hamlet lay many hundred yards away, though view, side next cove; greatly encouraged me, opposite direction whence blind man made his appearance whither he presumably returned. We many minutes road, though sometimes stopped lay hold hearken. But unusual sound--nothing low wash ripple croaking inmates wood. It already candle-light reached hamlet, I shall never forget much I cheered see yellow shine doors windows; that, proved, best help likely get quarter. For--you would thought men would ashamed themselves--no soul would consent return us Admiral Benbow. The told troubles, more--man, woman, child--they clung shelter houses. The name Captain Flint, though strange me, well enough known carried great weight terror. Some men field-work far side Admiral Benbow remembered, besides, seen several strangers road, taking smugglers, bolted away; one least seen little lugger called Kitt’s Hole. For matter, anyone comrade captain’s enough frighten death. And short long matter was, could get several willing enough ride Dr. Livesey’s, lay another direction, one would help us defend inn. They say cowardice infectious; argument is, hand, great emboldener; said his say, mother made speech. She would not, she declared, lose money belonged her fatherless boy; “If none rest dare,” she said, “Jim I dare. Back go, way came, small thanks big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. We will chest open, die it. And I will thank bag, Mrs. Crossley, bring back lawful money in.” Of course I said I would go mother, course cried foolhardiness, even man would go along us. All would give loaded pistol lest attacked, promise horses ready saddled case pursued return, one lad ride forward doctor’s search armed assistance. My heart beating finely two set forth cold night upon dangerous venture. A full moon beginning rise peered redly upper edges fog, increased haste, plain, came forth again, would bright day, departure exposed eyes watchers. We slipped along hedges, noiseless swift, see hear anything increase terrors, till, relief, door Admiral Benbow closed behind us. I slipped bolt once, stood panted moment dark, alone house dead captain’s body. Then mother got candle bar, holding other’s hands, advanced parlour. He lay left him, his back, his eyes open one arm stretched out. “Draw blind, Jim,” whispered mother; “they might come watch outside. And now,” said she I done so, “we get key _that;_ who is touch it, I like know!” she gave kind sob she said words. I went knees once. On floor close his hand little round paper, blackened one side. I could doubt _black spot;_ taking up, I found written side, good, clear hand, short message: “You till ten tonight.” “He till ten, Mother,” said I; I said it, old clock began striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly; news good, six. “Now, Jim,” she said, “that key.” I felt his pockets, one another. A small coins, thimble, thread big needles, piece pigtail tobacco bitten away end, his gully crooked handle, pocket compass, tinder box contained, I began despair. “Perhaps it is round his neck,” suggested mother. Overcoming strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt neck, there, sure enough, hanging bit tarry string, I cut his gully, found key. At triumph filled hope hurried upstairs without delay little room he slept long his box stood since day his arrival. It like seaman’s chest outside, initial “B” burned top hot iron, corners somewhat smashed broken long, rough usage. “Give key,” said mother; though lock stiff, she turned thrown back lid twinkling. A strong smell tobacco tar rose interior, nothing seen top except suit good clothes, carefully brushed folded. They never worn, mother said. Under that, miscellany began--a quadrant, tin canikin, several sticks tobacco, two brace handsome pistols, piece bar silver, old Spanish watch trinkets little value mostly foreign make, pair compasses mounted brass, five six curious West Indian shells. I often wondered since he carried shells his wandering, guilty, hunted life. In meantime, found nothing value silver trinkets, neither way. Underneath old boat-cloak, whitened sea-salt many harbour-bar. My mother pulled impatience, lay us, last things chest, bundle tied oilcloth, looking like papers, canvas bag gave forth, touch, jingle gold. “I will show rogues I am honest woman,” said mother. “I will dues, farthing over. Hold Mrs. Crossley’s bag.” And she began count amount captain’s score sailor’s bag one I holding. It long, difficult business, coins countries sizes--doubloons, louis d’ors, guineas, pieces eight, I know besides, shaken together random. The guineas, too, scarcest, mother knew make her count. When half-way through, I suddenly put hand upon her arm, I heard silent frosty air sound brought heart mouth--the tap-tapping blind man’s stick upon frozen road. It drew nearer nearer, sat holding breath. Then struck sharp inn door, could hear handle turned bolt rattling wretched tried enter; long time silence within without. At last tapping recommenced, and, indescribable joy gratitude, died slowly away ceased heard. “Mother,” said I, “take whole let us going,” I sure bolted door must seemed suspicious would bring whole hornet’s nest ears, though thankful I I bolted it, none could tell never met terrible blind man. But mother, frightened she was, would consent take fraction due her obstinately unwilling content less. It yet seven, she said, long way; she knew her rights she would them; she still arguing little low whistle sounded good way upon hill. That enough, enough, us. “I will take I have,” she said, jumping her feet. “And I will take square count,” said I, picking oilskin packet. Next moment groping downstairs, leaving candle empty chest; next opened door full retreat. We started moment soon. The fog rapidly dispersing; already moon shone quite clear high ground either side; exact bottom dell round tavern door thin veil still hung unbroken conceal first steps escape. Far less half-way hamlet, little beyond bottom hill, must come forth moonlight. Nor all, sound several footsteps running came already ears, looked back direction, light tossing fro still rapidly advancing showed one newcomers carried lantern. “My dear,” said mother suddenly, “take money run on. I going faint.” This certainly end us, I thought. How I cursed cowardice neighbours; I blamed poor mother her honesty her greed, her past foolhardiness present weakness! We little bridge, good fortune; I helped her, tottering she was, edge bank, where, sure enough, she gave sigh fell shoulder. I know I found strength all, I afraid roughly done, I managed drag her bank little way arch. Farther I could move her, bridge low let crawl it. So stay--my mother almost entirely exposed us within earshot inn. 5 The Last Blind Man MY curiosity, sense, stronger fear, I could remain I was, crept back bank again, whence, sheltering head behind bush broom, I might command road door. I scarcely position ere enemies began arrive, seven eight them, running hard, feet beating time along road man lantern paces front. Three men ran together, hand hand; I made out, even mist, middle man trio blind beggar. The next moment his voice showed I right. “Down door!” he cried. “Aye, aye, sir!” answered two three; rush made upon Admiral Benbow, lantern-bearer following; I could see pause, hear speeches passed lower key, surprised find door open. But pause brief, blind man issued his commands. His voice sounded louder higher, he afire eagerness rage. “In, in, in!” he shouted, cursed delay. Four five obeyed once, two remaining road formidable beggar. There pause, cry surprise, voice shouting house, “Bill’s dead.” But blind man swore delay. “Search him, shirking lubbers, rest aloft get chest,” he cried. I could hear feet rattling old stairs, house must shook it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds astonishment arose; window captain’s room thrown open slam jingle broken glass, man leaned moonlight, head shoulders, addressed blind beggar road him. “Pew,” he cried, “they have us. Someone is turned chest alow aloft.” “Is there?” roared Pew. “The money’s there.” The blind man cursed money. “Flint’s fist, I mean,” he cried. “We do not see nohow,” returned man. “Here, there, Bill?” cried blind man again. At another fellow, probably remained search captain’s body, came door inn. “Bill’s overhauled a’ready,” said he; “nothing left.” “It is people inn--it is boy. I wish I put his eyes out!” cried blind man, Pew. “There time ago--they door bolted I tried it. Scatter, lads, find  them.” “Sure enough, left glim here,” said fellow window. “Scatter find  them! Rout house out!” reiterated Pew, striking his stick upon road. Then followed great to-do old inn, heavy feet pounding fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, rocks re-echoed men came again, one another, road declared nowhere found. And whistle alarmed mother dead captain’s money clearly audible night, time twice repeated. I thought blind man’s trumpet, speak, summoning his crew assault, I found signal hillside towards hamlet, effect upon buccaneers, signal warn approaching danger. “There is Dirk again,” said one. “Twice! We will budge, mates.” “Budge, skulk!” cried Pew. “Dirk fool coward first--you would not mind him. They must close by; cannot far; hands it. Scatter look them, dogs! Oh, shiver soul,” he cried, “if I eyes!” This appeal seemed produce effect, two fellows began look among lumber, half-heartedly, I thought, half eye danger time, rest stood irresolute road. “You hands thousands, fools, hang leg! You would rich kings could find it, know it is here, stand skulking. There was not one dared face Bill, I it--a blind man! And I am lose chance you! I am poor, crawling beggar, sponging rum, I might rolling coach! If pluck weevil biscuit would catch still.” “Hang it, Pew, we have got doubloons!” grumbled one. “They might hid blessed thing,” said another. “Take Georges, Pew, do not stand squalling.” Squalling word it; Pew’s anger rose high objections till last, his passion completely taking upper hand, he struck right left his blindness his stick sounded heavily one. These, turn, cursed back blind miscreant, threatened horrid terms, tried vain catch stick wrest his grasp. This quarrel saving us, still raging, another sound came top hill side hamlet--the tramp horses galloping. Almost time pistol-shot, flash report, came hedge side. And plainly last signal danger, buccaneers turned ran, separating every direction, one seaward along cove, one slant across hill, on, half minute sign remained Pew. Him deserted, whether sheer panic revenge his ill words blows I know not; he remained behind, tapping road frenzy, groping calling his comrades. Finally he took wrong turn ran steps past me, towards hamlet, crying, “Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,” names, “you will not leave old Pew, mates--not old Pew!” Just noise horses topped rise, four five riders came sight moonlight swept full gallop slope. At Pew saw his error, turned scream, ran straight ditch, he rolled. But he his feet second made another dash, utterly bewildered, right nearest coming horses. The rider tried save him, vain. Down went Pew cry rang high night; four hoofs trampled spurned passed by. He fell his side, gently collapsed upon his face moved more. I leaped feet hailed riders. They pulling up, rate, horrified accident; I soon saw were. One, tailing behind rest, lad gone hamlet Dr. Livesey’s; rest revenue officers, he met way, he intelligence return once. Some news lugger Kitt’s Hole found way Supervisor Dance set forth night direction, circumstance mother I owed preservation death. Pew dead, stone dead. As mother, carried her hamlet, little cold water salts soon brought her back again, she none worse her terror, though she still continued deplore balance money. In meantime supervisor rode on, fast he could, Kitt’s Hole; his men dismount grope dingle, leading, sometimes supporting, horses, continual fear ambushes; great matter surprise got Hole lugger already way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling keep moonlight he would get lead him, time bullet whistled close his arm. Soon after, lugger doubled point disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, he said, “like fish water,” he could dispatch man B---- warn cutter. “And that,” said he, “is good nothing. They have got clean, there is end. Only,” he added, “I am glad I trod Master Pew’s corns,” time he heard story. I went back Admiral Benbow, cannot imagine house state smash; clock thrown fellows furious hunt mother myself; though nothing actually taken away except captain’s money-bag little silver till, I could see ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing scene. “They got money, say? Well, then, Hawkins, fortune after? More money, I suppose?” “No, sir; money, I think,” replied I. “In fact, sir, I believe I thing breast pocket; tell truth, I like get put safety.” “To sure, boy; quite right,” said he. “I will take it, like.” “I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey--” I began. “Perfectly right,” he interrupted cheerily, “perfectly right--a gentleman magistrate. And, I come think it, I might well ride round report squire. Master Pew’s dead, all’s done; I regret it, he is dead, see, people make officer his Majesty’s revenue, make can. Now, I will tell you, Hawkins, like, I will take along.” I thanked heartily offer, walked back hamlet horses were. By time I told mother purpose saddle. “Dogger,” said Mr. Dance, “you good horse; take lad behind you.” As soon I mounted, holding Dogger’s belt, supervisor gave word, party struck bouncing trot road Dr. Livesey’s house. 6 The Captain’s Papers WE rode hard way till drew Dr. Livesey’s door. The house dark front. Mr. Dance told jump knock, Dogger gave stirrup descend by. The door opened almost maid. “Is Dr. Livesey in?” I asked. No, she said, he come home afternoon gone hall dine pass evening squire. “So go, boys,” said Mr. Dance. This time, distance short, I mount, ran Dogger’s stirrup-leather lodge gates long, leafless, moonlit avenue white line hall buildings looked either hand great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, taking along him, admitted word house. The servant led us matted passage showed us end great library, lined bookcases busts upon top them, squire Dr. Livesey sat, pipe hand, either side bright fire. I never seen squire near hand. He tall man, six feet high, broad proportion, he bluff, rough-and-ready face, roughened reddened lined his long travels. His eyebrows black, moved readily, gave look temper, bad, would say, quick high. “Come in, Mr. Dance,” says he, stately condescending. “Good evening, Dance,” says doctor nod. “And good evening you, friend Jim. What good wind brings here?” The supervisor stood straight stiff told his story like lesson; seen two gentlemen leaned forward looked other, forgot smoke surprise interest. When heard mother went back inn, Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, squire cried “Bravo!” broke his long pipe grate. Long done, Mr. Trelawney (that, remember, squire’s name) got his seat striding room, doctor, hear better, taken his powdered wig sat looking strange indeed his close-cropped black poll. At last Mr. Dance finished story. “Mr. Dance,” said squire, “you noble fellow. And riding black, atrocious miscreant, I regard act virtue, sir, like stamping cockroach. This lad Hawkins trump, I perceive. Hawkins, ring bell? Mr. Dance must ale.” “And so, Jim,” said doctor, “you thing after, you?” “Here is, sir,” said I, gave oilskin packet. The doctor looked over, his fingers itching open it; instead that, he put quietly pocket his coat. “Squire,” said he, “when Dance his ale he must, course, his Majesty’s service; I mean keep Jim Hawkins sleep house, permission, I propose cold pie let sup.” “As will, Livesey,” said squire; “Hawkins earned better cold pie.” So big pigeon pie brought put sidetable, I made hearty supper, I hungry hawk, Mr. Dance complimented last dismissed. “And now, squire,” said doctor. “And now, Livesey,” said squire breath. “One time, one time,” laughed Dr. Livesey. “You heard Flint, I suppose?” “Heard him!” cried squire. “Heard him, say! He bloodthirstiest buccaneer sailed. Blackbeard child Flint. The Spaniards prodigiously afraid that, I tell you, sir, I sometimes proud he Englishman. I have seen his top-sails eyes, Trinidad, cowardly son rum-puncheon I sailed put back--put back, sir, Port Spain.” “Well, I have heard myself, England,” said doctor. “But point is, he money?” “Money!” cried squire. “Have heard story? What villains money? What care money? For would risk rascal carcasses money?” “That shall soon know,” replied doctor. “But confoundedly hot-headed exclamatory I cannot get word in. What I want know this: Supposing I pocket clue Flint buried his treasure, treasure amount much?” “Amount, sir!” cried squire. “It amount this: If clue talk about, I fit ship Bristol dock, take Hawkins along, I will treasure I search year.” “Very well,” said doctor. “Now, then, Jim agreeable, we will open packet”; he laid table. The bundle sewn together, doctor get his instrument case cut stitches his medical scissors. It contained two things--a book sealed paper. “First we will try book,” observed doctor. The squire I peering his shoulder he opened it, Dr. Livesey kindly motioned come round side-table, I eating, enjoy sport search. On first page scraps writing, man pen his hand might make idleness practice. One tattoo mark, “Billy Bones his fancy”; “Mr. W. Bones, mate,” “No rum,” “Off Palm Key he got itt,” snatches, mostly single words unintelligible. I could help wondering “got itt,” “itt” he got. A knife his back like not. “Not much instruction there,” said Dr. Livesey he passed on. The next ten twelve pages filled curious series entries. There date one end line sum money, common account-books, instead explanatory writing, varying number crosses two. On 12th June, 1745, instance, sum seventy pounds plainly become due someone, nothing six crosses explain because. In cases, sure, name place would added, “Offe Caraccas,” mere entry latitude longitude, “62o 17′ 20″, 19o 2′ 40″.” The record lasted nearly twenty years, amount separate entries growing larger time went on, end grand total made five six wrong additions, words appended, “Bones, his pile.” “I cannot make head tail this,” said Dr. Livesey. “The thing clear noonday,” cried squire. “This black-hearted hound’s account-book. These crosses stand names ships towns sank plundered. The sums scoundrel’s share, he feared ambiguity, see he added something clearer. ‘Offe Caraccas,’ now; see, unhappy vessel boarded coast. God help poor souls manned her--coral long ago.” “Right!” said doctor. “See traveller. Right! And amounts increase, see, he rose rank.” There little else volume bearings places noted blank leaves towards end table reducing French, English, Spanish moneys common value. “Thrifty man!” cried doctor. “He was not one cheated.” “And now,” said squire, “for other.” The paper sealed several places thimble way seal; thimble, perhaps, I found captain’s pocket. The doctor opened seals great care, fell map island, latitude longitude, soundings, names hills bays inlets, every particular would needed bring ship safe anchorage upon shores. It nine miles long five across, shaped, might say, like fat dragon standing up, two fine land-locked harbours, hill centre part marked “The Spy-glass.” There several additions later date, all, three crosses red ink--two north part island, one southwest--and beside last, red ink, small, neat hand, different captain’s tottery characters, words: “Bulk treasure here.” Over back hand written information: Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing point N. N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. E. Ten feet. The bar silver north cache; find trend east hummock, ten fathoms south black crag face it. The arms easy found, sand-hill, N. point north inlet cape, bearing E. quarter N. J.F. That all; brief was, incomprehensible, filled squire Dr. Livesey delight. “Livesey,” said squire, “you give wretched practice once. Tomorrow I start Bristol. In three weeks’ time--three weeks!--two weeks--ten days--we will best ship, sir, choicest crew England. Hawkins shall come cabin-boy. You will make famous cabin-boy, Hawkins. You, Livesey, ship’s doctor; I admiral. We will take Redruth, Joyce, Hunter. We will favourable winds, quick passage, least difficulty finding spot, money eat, roll in, play duck drake ever after.” “Trelawney,” said doctor, “I will go you; I will go bail it, Jim, credit undertaking. There is one man I am afraid of.” “And who is that?” cried squire. “Name dog, sir!” “You,” replied doctor; “for cannot hold tongue. We men know paper. These fellows attacked inn tonight--bold, desperate blades, sure--and rest stayed aboard lugger, more, I dare say, far off, are, one all, thick thin, bound they will get money. We must none us go alone till get sea. Jim I shall stick together meanwhile; you will take Joyce Hunter ride Bristol, first last, one us must breathe word we have found.” “Livesey,” returned squire, “you always right it. I will silent grave.” PART TWO--The Sea-cook 7 I Go Bristol IT longer squire imagined ere ready sea, none first plans--not even Dr. Livesey’s, keeping beside him--could carried intended. The doctor go London physician take charge his practice; squire hard work Bristol; I lived hall charge old Redruth, gamekeeper, almost prisoner, full sea-dreams charming anticipations strange islands adventures. I brooded hour together map, details I well remembered. Sitting fire housekeeper’s room, I approached island fancy every possible direction; I explored every acre surface; I climbed thousand times tall hill call Spy-glass, top enjoyed wonderful changing prospects. Sometimes isle thick savages, fought, sometimes full dangerous animals hunted us, fancies nothing occurred strange tragic actual adventures. So weeks passed on, till one fine day came letter addressed Dr. Livesey, addition, “To opened, case his absence, Tom Redruth young Hawkins.” Obeying order, found, rather I found--for gamekeeper poor hand reading anything print--the following important news: Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17-- Dear Livesey--As I know whether hall still London, I send double places. The ship bought fitted. She lies anchor, ready sea. You never imagined sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA. I got her old friend, Blandly, proved throughout surprising trump. The admirable fellow literally slaved interest, so, I may say, everyone Bristol, soon got wind port sailed for--treasure, I mean. “Redruth,” said I, interrupting letter, “Dr. Livesey like that. The squire talking, all.” “Well, who is better right?” growled gamekeeper. “A pretty rum go squire are not talk Dr. Livesey, I think.” At I gave attempts commentary read straight on: Blandly found HISPANIOLA, admirable management got her merest trifle. There class men Bristol monstrously prejudiced Blandly. They go length declaring honest creature would anything money, HISPANIOLA belonged him, he sold absurdly high--the transparent calumnies. None dare, however, deny merits ship. So far hitch. The workpeople, sure--riggers not--were annoyingly slow; time cured that. It crew troubled me. I wished round score men--in case natives, buccaneers, odious French--and I worry deuce find much half dozen, till remarkable stroke fortune brought man I required. I standing dock, when, merest accident, I fell talk him. I found he old sailor, kept public-house, knew seafaring men Bristol, lost his health ashore, wanted good berth cook get sea again. He hobbled morning, he said, get smell salt. I monstrously touched--so would been--and, pure pity, I engaged spot ship’s cook. Long John Silver, he called, lost leg; I regarded recommendation, since he lost his country’s service, immortal Hawke. He pension, Livesey. Imagine abominable age live in! Well, sir, I thought I found cook, crew I discovered. Between Silver got together days company toughest old salts imaginable--not pretty look at, fellows, faces, indomitable spirit. I declare could fight frigate. Long John even got rid two six seven I already engaged. He showed moment sort fresh-water swabs fear adventure importance. I magnificent health spirits, eating like bull, sleeping like tree, yet I shall enjoy moment till I hear old tarpaulins tramping round capstan. Seaward, ho! Hang treasure! It is glory sea turned head. So now, Livesey, come post; lose hour, respect me. Let young Hawkins go see his mother, Redruth guard; come full speed Bristol. John Trelawney Postscript--I tell Blandly, who, way, send consort us do not turn end August, found admirable fellow sailing master--a stiff man, I regret, respects treasure. Long John Silver unearthed competent man mate, man named Arrow. I boatswain pipes, Livesey; things shall go man-of-war fashion board good ship HISPANIOLA. I forgot tell Silver man substance; I know knowledge he banker’s account, never overdrawn. He leaves his wife manage inn; she woman colour, pair old bachelors like I may excused guessing wife, quite much health, sends back roving. J. T. P.P.S.--Hawkins may stay one night his mother. J. T. You fancy excitement letter put me. I half beside glee; ever I despised man, old Tom Redruth, could nothing grumble lament. Any under-gamekeepers would gladly changed places him; squire’s pleasure, squire’s pleasure like law among all. Nobody old Redruth would dared much even grumble. The next morning he I set foot Admiral Benbow, I found mother good health spirits. The captain, long much discomfort, gone wicked cease troubling. The squire everything repaired, public rooms sign repainted, added furniture--above beautiful armchair mother bar. He found her boy apprentice also she want help I gone. It seeing boy I understood, first time, situation. I thought moment adventures me, home I leaving; now, sight clumsy stranger, stay place beside mother, I first attack tears. I afraid I led boy dog’s life, he new work, I hundred opportunities setting right putting down, I slow profit them. The night passed, next day, dinner, Redruth I afoot road. I said good-bye Mother cove I lived since I born, dear old Admiral Benbow--since he repainted, longer quite dear. One last thoughts captain, often strode along beach his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, his old brass telescope. Next moment turned corner home sight. The mail picked us dusk Royal George heath. I wedged Redruth stout old gentleman, spite swift motion cold night air, I must dozed great deal first, slept like log hill dale stage stage, I awakened last punch ribs, I opened eyes find standing still large building city street day already broken long time. “Where we?” I asked. “Bristol,” said Tom. “Get down.” Mr. Trelawney taken his residence inn far docks superintend work upon schooner. Thither walk, way, great delight, lay along quays beside great multitude ships sizes rigs nations. In one, sailors singing work, another men aloft, high head, hanging threads seemed thicker spider’s. Though I lived shore life, I seemed never near sea till then. The smell tar salt something new. I saw wonderful figureheads, far ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, rings ears, whiskers curled ringlets, tarry pigtails, swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; I seen many kings archbishops I could delighted. And I going sea myself, sea schooner, piping boatswain pig-tailed singing seamen, sea, bound unknown island, seek buried treasure! While I still delightful dream, came suddenly front large inn met Squire Trelawney, dressed like sea-officer, stout blue cloth, coming door smile his face capital imitation sailor’s walk. “Here are,” he cried, “and doctor came last night London. Bravo! The ship’s company complete!” “Oh, sir,” cried I, “when sail?” “Sail!” says he. “We sail tomorrow!” 8 At Sign Spy-glass WHEN I done breakfasting squire gave note addressed John Silver, sign Spy-glass, told I easily find place following line docks keeping bright lookout little tavern large brass telescope sign. I set off, overjoyed opportunity see ships seamen, picked way among great crowd people carts bales, dock busiest, I found tavern question. It bright enough little place entertainment. The sign newly painted; windows neat red curtains; floor cleanly sanded. There street side open door both, made large, low room pretty clear see in, spite clouds tobacco smoke. The customers mostly seafaring men, talked loudly I hung door, almost afraid enter. As I waiting, man came side room, glance I sure he must Long John. His left leg cut close hip, left shoulder he carried crutch, he managed wonderful dexterity, hopping upon like bird. He tall strong, face big ham--plain pale, intelligent smiling. Indeed, he seemed cheerful spirits, whistling he moved among tables, merry word slap shoulder favoured his guests. Now, tell truth, first mention Long John Squire Trelawney’s letter I taken fear mind he might prove one-legged sailor I watched long old Benbow. But one look man enough. I seen captain, Black Dog, blind man, Pew, I thought I knew buccaneer like--a different creature, according me, clean pleasant-tempered landlord. I plucked courage once, crossed threshold, walked right man he stood, propped his crutch, talking customer. “Mr. Silver, sir?” I asked, holding note. “Yes, lad,” said he; “such name, sure. And may be?” And he saw squire’s letter, he seemed give something almost like start. “Oh!” said he, quite loud, offering his hand. “I see. You new cabin-boy; pleased I see you.” And he took hand his large firm grasp. Just one customers far side rose suddenly made door. It close him, he street moment. But his hurry attracted notice, I recognized glance. It tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, come first Admiral Benbow. “Oh,” I cried, “stop him! It is Black Dog!” “I do not care two coppers he is,” cried Silver. “But he has not paid his score. Harry, run catch him.” One others nearest door leaped started pursuit. “If he Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score,” cried Silver; then, relinquishing hand, “Who say he was?” he asked. “Black what?” “Dog, sir,” said I. “Has Mr. Trelawney told buccaneers? He one them.” “So?” cried Silver. “In house! Ben, run help Harry. One swabs, he? Was drinking him, Morgan? Step here.” The man he called Morgan--an old, grey-haired, mahogany-faced sailor--came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his quid. “Now, Morgan,” said Long John sternly, “you never clapped eyes Black--Black Dog before, you, now?” “Not I, sir,” said Morgan salute. “You did not know his name, you?” “No, sir.” “By powers, Tom Morgan, it is good you!” exclaimed landlord. “If mixed like that, would never put another foot house, may lay that. And he saying you?” “I do not rightly know, sir,” answered Morgan. “Do call head shoulders, blessed dead-eye?” cried Long John. “Do not rightly know, do not you! Perhaps do not happen rightly know speaking to, perhaps? Come, now, he jawing--v’yages, cap’ns, ships? Pipe up! What it?” “We a-talkin’ keel-hauling,” answered Morgan. “Keel-hauling, you? And mighty suitable thing, too, may lay that. Get back place lubber, Tom.” And then, Morgan rolled back his seat, Silver added confidential whisper flattering, I thought, “He is quite honest man, Tom Morgan, on’y stupid. And now,” he ran again, aloud, “let us see--Black Dog? No, I do not know name, I. Yet I kind think I have--yes, I have seen swab. He used come blind beggar, he used.” “That he did, may sure,” said I. “I knew blind man too. His name Pew.” “It was!” cried Silver, quite excited. “Pew! That his name certain. Ah, he looked shark, he did! If run Black Dog, now, there will news Cap’n Trelawney! Ben’s good runner; seamen run better Ben. He run down, hand hand, powers! He talked keel-hauling, he? I WILL keel-haul him!” All time he jerking phrases he stumping tavern his crutch, slapping tables his hand, giving show excitement would convinced Old Bailey judge Bow Street runner. My suspicions thoroughly reawakened finding Black Dog Spy-glass, I watched cook narrowly. But he deep, ready, clever me, time two men come back breath confessed lost track crowd, scolded like thieves, I would gone bail innocence Long John Silver. “See here, now, Hawkins,” said he, “here is blessed hard thing man like me, now, are not it? There is Cap’n Trelawney--what is he think? Here I confounded son Dutchman sitting house drinking rum! Here comes tells plain; I let give us slip blessed deadlights! Now, Hawkins, justice cap’n. You are lad, are, you are smart paint. I see first come in. Now, is: What could I do, old timber I hobble on? When I A B master mariner I would come alongside him, hand hand, broached brace old shakes, I would; now--” And then, sudden, he stopped, his jaw dropped though he remembered something. “The score!” he burst out. “Three goes rum! Why, shiver timbers, I had not forgotten score!” And falling bench, he laughed tears ran his cheeks. I could help joining, laughed together, peal peal, tavern rang again. “Why, precious old sea-calf I am!” he said last, wiping his cheeks. “You get well, Hawkins, I will take davy I rated ship’s boy. But come now, stand go about. This will not do. Dooty dooty, messmates. I will put old cockerel hat, step along Cap’n Trelawney, report affair. For mind you, it is serious, young Hawkins; neither me’s come I make bold call credit. Nor neither, says you; smart--none pair us smart. But dash buttons! That good un score.” And he began laugh again, heartily, though I see joke he did, I obliged join his mirth. On little walk along quays, he made interesting companion, telling different ships passed by, rig, tonnage, nationality, explaining work going forward--how one discharging, another taking cargo, third making ready sea--and every telling little anecdote ships seamen repeating nautical phrase till I learned perfectly. I began see one best possible shipmates. When got inn, squire Dr. Livesey seated together, finishing quart ale toast it, go aboard schooner visit inspection. Long John told story first last, great deal spirit perfect truth. “That were, now, were not it, Hawkins?” he would say, again, I could always bear entirely out. The two gentlemen regretted Black Dog got away, agreed nothing done, he complimented, Long John took his crutch departed. “All hands aboard four afternoon,” shouted squire him. “Aye, aye, sir,” cried cook, passage. “Well, squire,” said Dr. Livesey, “I do not put much faith discoveries, general thing; I say this, John Silver suits me.” “The man’s perfect trump,” declared squire. “And now,” added doctor, “Jim may come board us, may he not?” “To sure he may,” says squire. “Take hat, Hawkins, we will see ship.” 9 Powder Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay way out, went figureheads round sterns many ships, cables sometimes grated underneath keel, sometimes swung us. At last, however, got alongside, met saluted stepped aboard mate, Mr. Arrow, brown old sailor earrings his ears squint. He squire thick friendly, I soon observed things Mr. Trelawney captain. This last sharp-looking man seemed angry everything board soon tell us why, hardly got cabin sailor followed us. “Captain Smollett, sir, axing speak you,” said he. “I always captain’s orders. Show in,” said squire. The captain, close behind his messenger, entered shut door behind him. “Well, Captain Smollett, say? All well, I hope; shipshape seaworthy?” “Well, sir,” said captain, “better speak plain, I believe, even risk offence. I do not like cruise; I do not like men; I do not like officer. That is short sweet.” “Perhaps, sir, do not like ship?” inquired squire, angry, I could see. “I cannot speak that, sir, seen her tried,” said captain. “She seems clever craft; I cannot say.” “Possibly, sir, may like employer, either?” says squire. But Dr. Livesey cut in. “Stay bit,” said he, “stay bit. No use questions produce ill feeling. The captain said much he said little, I am bound say I require explanation his words. You do not, say, like cruise. Now, why?” “I engaged, sir, call sealed orders, sail ship gentleman he bid me,” said captain. “So far good. But I find every man mast knows I do. I do not call fair, now, you?” “No,” said Dr. Livesey, “I do not.” “Next,” said captain, “I learn going treasure--hear hands, mind you. Now, treasure ticklish work; I do not like treasure voyages account, I do not like them, all, secret (begging pardon, Mr. Trelawney) secret told parrot.” “Silver’s parrot?” asked squire. “It is way speaking,” said captain. “Blabbed, I mean. It is belief neither gentlemen know about, I will tell way it--life death, close run.” “That clear, and, I dare say, true enough,” replied Dr. Livesey. “We take risk, ignorant believe us. Next, say do not like crew. Are good seamen?” “I do not like them, sir,” returned Captain Smollett. “And I think I choosing hands, go that.” “Perhaps should,” replied doctor. “My friend should, perhaps, taken along him; slight, one, unintentional. And do not like Mr. Arrow?” “I do not, sir. I believe he is good seaman, he is free crew good officer. A mate keep himself--should not drink men mast!” “Do mean he drinks?” cried squire. “No, sir,” replied captain, “only he is familiar.” “Well, now, short long it, captain?” asked doctor. “Tell us want.” “Well, gentlemen, determined go cruise?” “Like iron,” answered squire. “Very good,” said captain. “Then, you have heard patiently, saying things I could prove, hear words more. They putting powder arms fore hold. Now, good place cabin; put there?--first point. Then, bringing four people you, tell berthed forward. Why give berths beside cabin?--second point.” “Any more?” asked Mr. Trelawney. “One more,” said captain. “There is much blabbing already.” “Far much,” agreed doctor. “I will tell I have heard myself,” continued Captain Smollett: “that map island, there is crosses map show treasure is, island lies--” And he named latitude longitude exactly. “I never told that,” cried squire, “to soul!” “The hands know it, sir,” returned captain. “Livesey, must Hawkins,” cried squire. “It does not much matter was,” replied doctor. And I could see neither he captain paid much regard Mr. Trelawney’s protestations. Neither I, sure, he loose talker; yet case I believe he really right nobody told situation island. “Well, gentlemen,” continued captain, “I do not know map; I make point, shall kept secret even Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I would ask let resign.” “I see,” said doctor. “You wish us keep matter dark make garrison stern part ship, manned friend’s people, provided arms powder board. In words, fear mutiny.” “Sir,” said Captain Smollett, “with intention take offence, I deny right put words mouth. No captain, sir, would justified going sea he ground enough say that. As Mr. Arrow, I believe thoroughly honest; men same; may I know. But I responsible ship’s safety life every man Jack aboard her. I see things going, I think, quite right. And I ask take certain precautions let resign berth. And that is all.” “Captain Smollett,” began doctor smile, “did ever hear fable mountain mouse? You will excuse me, I dare say, remind fable. When came here, I will stake wig, meant this.” “Doctor,” said captain, “you smart. When I came I meant get discharged. I thought Mr. Trelawney would hear word.” “No I would,” cried squire. “Had Livesey I seen deuce. As is, I heard you. I desire, I think worse you.” “That is please, sir,” said captain. “You will find I duty.” And he took his leave. “Trelawney,” said doctor, “contrary notions, I believed managed get two honest men board you--that man John Silver.” “Silver, like,” cried squire; “but intolerable humbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly, unsailorly, downright un-English.” “Well,” says doctor, “we shall see.” When came deck, men begun already take arms powder, yo-ho-ing work, captain Mr. Arrow stood superintending. The new arrangement quite liking. The whole schooner overhauled; six berths made astern after-part main hold; set cabins joined galley forecastle sparred passage port side. It originally meant captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, doctor, squire occupy six berths. Now Redruth I get two Mr. Arrow captain sleep deck companion, enlarged side till might almost called round-house. Very low still, course; room swing two hammocks, even mate seemed pleased arrangement. Even he, perhaps, doubtful crew, guess, shall hear, long benefit his opinion. We hard work, changing powder berths, last man two, Long John along them, came shore-boat. The cook came side like monkey cleverness, soon he saw doing, “So ho, mates!” says he. “What is this?” “We are a-changing powder, Jack,” answers one. “Why, powers,” cried Long John, “if do, we will miss morning tide!” “My orders!” said captain shortly. “You may go below, man. Hands want supper.” “Aye, aye, sir,” answered cook, touching his forelock, he disappeared direction his galley. “That is good man, captain,” said doctor. “Very likely, sir,” replied Captain Smollett. “Easy that, men--easy,” he ran on, fellows shifting powder; suddenly observing examining swivel carried amidships, long brass nine, “Here you, ship’s boy,” he cried, “out that! Off cook get work.” And I hurrying I heard say, quite loudly, doctor, “I will favourites ship.” I assure I quite squire’s way thinking, hated captain deeply. 10 The Voyage ALL night great bustle getting things stowed place, boatfuls squire’s friends, Mr. Blandly like, coming wish good voyage safe return. We never night Admiral Benbow I half work; I dog-tired when, little dawn, boatswain sounded his pipe crew began man capstan-bars. I might twice weary, yet I would left deck, new interesting me--the brief commands, shrill note whistle, men bustling places glimmer ship’s lanterns. “Now, Barbecue, tip us stave,” cried one voice. “The old one,” cried another. “Aye, aye, mates,” said Long John, standing by, his crutch his arm, broke air words I knew well: “Fifteen men dead man’s chest--” And whole crew bore chorus:-- “Yo-ho-ho, bottle rum!” And third “Ho!” drove bars will. Even exciting moment carried back old Admiral Benbow second, I seemed hear voice captain piping chorus. But soon anchor short up; soon hanging dripping bows; soon sails began draw, land shipping flit either side; I could lie snatch hour slumber HISPANIOLA begun her voyage Isle Treasure. I going relate voyage detail. It fairly prosperous. The ship proved good ship, crew capable seamen, captain thoroughly understood his business. But came length Treasure Island, two three things happened require known. Mr. Arrow, first all, turned even worse captain feared. He command among men, people pleased him. But means worst it, day two sea he began appear deck hazy eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, marks drunkenness. Time time he ordered disgrace. Sometimes he fell cut himself; sometimes he lay day long his little bunk one side companion; sometimes day two he would almost sober attend his work least passably. In meantime, could never make he got drink. That ship’s mystery. Watch pleased, could nothing solve it; asked his face, he would laugh he drunk, he sober deny solemnly he ever tasted anything water. He useless officer bad influence amongst men, plain rate he must soon kill outright, nobody much surprised, sorry, one dark night, head sea, he disappeared entirely seen more. “Overboard!” said captain. “Well, gentlemen, saves trouble putting irons.” But were, without mate; necessary, course, advance one men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, likeliest man aboard, though he kept his old title, he served way mate. Mr. Trelawney followed sea, his knowledge made useful, he often took watch easy weather. And coxswain, Israel Hands, careful, wily, old, experienced seaman could trusted pinch almost anything. He great confidant Long John Silver, mention his name leads speak ship’s cook, Barbecue, men called him. Aboard ship he carried his crutch lanyard round his neck, hands free possible. It something see wedge foot crutch bulkhead, propped it, yielding every movement ship, get his cooking like someone safe ashore. Still strange see heaviest weather cross deck. He line two rigged help across widest spaces--Long John’s earrings, called; he would hand one place another, using crutch, trailing alongside lanyard, quickly another man could walk. Yet men sailed expressed pity see reduced. “He is common man, Barbecue,” said coxswain me. “He good schooling his young days speak like book minded; brave--a lion’s nothing alongside Long John! I seen grapple four knock heads together--him unarmed.” All crew respected even obeyed him. He way talking everybody particular service. To he unweariedly kind, always glad see galley, he kept clean new pin, dishes hanging burnished his parrot cage one corner. “Come away, Hawkins,” he would say; “come yarn John. Nobody welcome yourself, son. Sit hear news. Here is Cap’n Flint--I calls parrot Cap’n Flint, famous buccaneer--here is Cap’n Flint predicting success v’yage. Was not you, cap’n?” And parrot would say, great rapidity, “Pieces eight! Pieces eight! Pieces eight!” till wondered breath, till John threw his handkerchief cage. “Now, bird,” he would say, “is, maybe, two hundred years old, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; anybody’s seen wickedness, must devil himself. She is sailed England, great Cap’n England, pirate. She is Madagascar, Malabar, Surinam, Providence, Portobello. She fishing wrecked plate ships. It is she learned ‘Pieces eight,’ little wonder; three hundred fifty thousand  them, Hawkins! She boarding viceroy Indies Goa, she was; look her would think she babby. But smelt powder--did not you, cap’n?” “Stand go about,” parrot would scream. “Ah, she is handsome craft, she is,” cook would say, give her sugar his pocket, bird would peck bars swear straight on, passing belief wickedness. “There,” John would add, “you cannot touch pitch mucked, lad. Here is poor old innocent bird mine swearing blue fire, none wiser, may lay that. She would swear same, manner speaking, chaplain.” And John would touch his forelock solemn way he made think he best men. In meantime, squire Captain Smollett still pretty distant terms one another. The squire made bones matter; he despised captain. The captain, his part, never spoke he spoken to, sharp short dry, word wasted. He owned, driven corner, he seemed wrong crew, brisk he wanted see behaved fairly well. As ship, he taken downright fancy her. “She will lie point nearer wind man right expect his married wife, sir. But,” he would add, “all I say is, we are home again, I do not like cruise.” The squire, this, would turn away march deck, chin air. “A trifle man,” he would say, “and I shall explode.” We heavy weather, proved qualities HISPANIOLA. Every man board seemed well content, must hard please otherwise, belief never ship’s company spoiled since Noah put sea. Double grog going least excuse; duff odd days, as, instance, squire heard man’s birthday, always barrel apples standing broached waist anyone help fancy. “Never knew good come yet,” captain said Dr. Livesey. “Spoil forecastle hands, make devils. That is belief.” But good come apple barrel, shall hear, that, note warning might perished hand treachery. This came about. We run trades get wind island after--I allowed plain--and running bright lookout day night. It last day outward voyage largest computation; time night, latest noon morrow, sight Treasure Island. We heading S.S.W. steady breeze abeam quiet sea. The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit whiff spray. All drawing alow aloft; everyone bravest spirits near end first part adventure. Now, sundown, work I way berth, occurred I like apple. I ran deck. The watch forward looking island. The man helm watching luff sail whistling away gently himself, sound excepting swish sea bows around sides ship. In I got bodily apple barrel, found scarce apple left; sitting dark, sound waters rocking movement ship, I either fallen asleep point heavy man sat rather clash close by. The barrel shook he leaned his shoulders it, I jump man began speak. It Silver’s voice, I heard dozen words, I would shown world, lay there, trembling listening, extreme fear curiosity, dozen words I understood lives honest men aboard depended upon alone. 11 What I Heard Apple Barrel “NO, I,” said Silver. “Flint cap’n; I quartermaster, along timber leg. The broadside I lost leg, old Pew lost his deadlights. It master surgeon, ampytated me--out college all--Latin bucket, not; he hanged like dog, sun-dried like rest, Corso Castle. That Roberts’ men, was, comed changing names ships--ROYAL FORTUNE on. Now, ship christened, let her stay, I says. So CASSANDRA, brought us safe home Malabar, England took viceroy Indies; old WALRUS, Flint’s old ship, I have seen amuck red blood fit sink gold.” “Ah!” cried another voice, youngest hand board, evidently full admiration. “He flower flock, Flint!” “Davis man too, accounts,” said Silver. “I never sailed along him; first England, Flint, that is story; account, manner speaking. I laid nine hundred safe, England, two thousand Flint. That are not bad man mast--all safe bank. ’Tain’t earning now, it is saving it, may lay that. Where is England’s men now? I do not know. Where is Flint’s? Why,  them aboard here, glad get duff--been begging that,  them. Old Pew, lost his sight, might thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound year, like lord Parliament. Where he now? Well, he is dead hatches; two year that, shiver timbers, man starving! He begged, he stole, he cut throats, starved that, powers!” “Well, are not much use, all,” said young seaman. “’Tain’t much use fools, may lay it--that, nothing,” cried Silver. “But now, look here: you are young, are, you are smart paint. I see I set eyes you, I will talk like man.” You may imagine I felt I heard abominable old rogue addressing another words flattery he used myself. I think, I able, I would killed barrel. Meantime, he ran on, little supposing he overheard. “Here gentlemen fortune. They lives rough, risk swinging, eat drink like fighting-cocks, cruise done, why, it is hundreds pounds instead hundreds farthings pockets. Now, goes rum good fling, sea shirts. But that is course I lay. I puts away, here, there, none much anywheres, reason suspicion. I am fifty, mark you; back cruise, I set gentleman earnest. Time enough too, says you. Ah, I have lived easy meantime, never denied nothing heart desires, slep’ soft ate dainty days sea. And I begin? Before mast, like you!” “Well,” said other, “but money’s gone now, are not it? You dare not show face Bristol this.” “Why, might suppose was?” asked Silver derisively. “At Bristol, banks places,” answered his companion. “It were,” said cook; “it weighed anchor. But old missis now. And Spy-glass sold, lease goodwill rigging; old girl’s meet me. I would tell where, I trust you, it would make jealousy among mates.” “And trust missis?” asked other. “Gentlemen fortune,” returned cook, “usually trusts little among themselves, right are, may lay it. But I way me, I have. When mate brings slip his cable--one knows me, I mean--it will not world old John. There feared Pew, feared Flint; Flint his self feared me. Feared he was, proud. They roughest crew afloat, Flint’s; devil would feared go sea them. Well now, I tell you, I am boasting man, seen easy I keep company, I quartermaster, LAMBS was not word Flint’s old buccaneers. Ah, may sure old John’s ship.” “Well, I tell now,” replied lad, “I did not half quarter like job till I talk you, John; there is hand now.” “And brave lad were, smart too,” answered Silver, shaking hands heartily barrel shook, “and finer figurehead gentleman fortune I never clapped eyes on.” By time I begun understand meaning terms. By “gentleman fortune” plainly meant neither less common pirate, little scene I overheard last act corruption one honest hands--perhaps last one left aboard. But point I soon relieved, Silver giving little whistle, third man strolled sat party. “Dick’s square,” said Silver. “Oh, I know’d Dick square,” returned voice coxswain, Israel Hands. “He is fool, Dick.” And he turned his quid spat. “But look here,” he went on, “here is I want know, Barbecue: long a-going stand like blessed bumboat? I have a’most enough Cap’n Smollett; he is hazed long enough, thunder! I want go cabin, I do. I want pickles wines, that.” “Israel,” said Silver, “your head are not much account, ever was. But you are able hear, I reckon; leastways, ears big enough. Now, here is I say: you will berth forward, you will live hard, you will speak soft, you will keep sober till I give word; may lay that, son.” “Well, I do not say no, I?” growled coxswain. “What I say is, when? That is I say.” “When! By powers!” cried Silver. “Well now, want know, I will tell when. The last moment I manage, that is when. Here is first-rate seaman, Cap’n Smollett, sails blessed ship us. Here is squire doctor map such--I do not know is, I? No you, says you. Well then, I mean squire doctor shall find stuff, help us get aboard, powers. Then we will see. If I sure all, sons double Dutchmen, I would Cap’n Smollett navigate us half-way back I struck.” “Why, we are seamen aboard here, I think,” said lad Dick. “We are forecastle hands, mean,” snapped Silver. “We steer course, who is set one? That is gentlemen split on, first last. If I way, I would Cap’n Smollett work us back trades least; we would blessed miscalculations spoonful water day. But I know sort are. I will finish  them island, soon’s blunt’s board, pity is. But you are never happy till you are drunk. Split sides, I have sick heart sail likes you!” “Easy all, Long John,” cried Israel. “Who is a-crossin’ you?” “Why, many tall ships, think ye, now, I seen laid aboard? And many brisk lads drying sun Execution Dock?” cried Silver. “And hurry hurry hurry. You hear me? I seen thing two sea, I have. If would on’y lay course, p’int windward, would ride carriages, would. But you! I know you. You will mouthful rum tomorrow, go hang.” “Everybody knowed kind chapling, John; there is others could hand steer well you,” said Israel. “They liked bit fun, did. They was not high dry, nohow, took fling, like jolly companions every one.” “So?” says Silver. “Well, now? Pew sort, he died beggar-man. Flint was, he died rum Savannah. Ah, sweet crew, was! On’y, they?” “But,” asked Dick, “when lay  them athwart,  them, anyhow?” “There is man me!” cried cook admiringly. “That is I call business. Well, would think? Put  them ashore like maroons? That would England’s way. Or cut  them like much pork? That would Flint’s, Billy Bones’s.” “Billy man that,” said Israel. “‘Dead men do not bite,’ says he. Well, he is dead hisself; he knows long short now; ever rough hand come port, Billy.” “Right are,” said Silver; “rough ready. But mark here, I am easy man--I am quite gentleman, says you; time it is serious. Dooty dooty, mates. I give vote--death. When I am Parlyment riding coach, I do not want none sea-lawyers cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like devil prayers. Wait I say; time comes, why, let her rip!” “John,” cries coxswain, “you are man!” “You will say so, Israel see,” said Silver. “Only one thing I claim--I claim Trelawney. I will wring his calf’s head his body hands, Dick!” he added, breaking off. “You jump up, like sweet lad, get apple, wet pipe like.” You may fancy terror I in! I leaped run I found strength, limbs heart alike misgave me. I heard Dick begin rise, someone seemingly stopped him, voice Hands exclaimed, “Oh, stow that! Do not get sucking bilge, John. Let us go rum.” “Dick,” said Silver, “I trust you. I have gauge keg, mind. There is key; fill pannikin bring up.” Terrified I was, I could help thinking must Mr. Arrow got strong waters destroyed him. Dick gone little while, his absence Israel spoke straight cook’s ear. It word two I could catch, yet I gathered important news, besides scraps tended purpose, whole clause audible: “Not another man them’ll jine.” Hence still faithful men board. When Dick returned, one another trio took pannikin drank--one “To luck,” another “Here is old Flint,” Silver saying, kind song, “Here is ourselves, hold luff, plenty prizes plenty duff.” Just sort brightness fell upon barrel, looking up, I found moon risen silvering mizzen-top shining white luff fore-sail; almost time voice lookout shouted, “Land ho!” 12 Council War THERE great rush feet across deck. I could hear people tumbling cabin forecastle, slipping instant outside barrel, I dived behind fore-sail, made double towards stern, came upon open deck time join Hunter Dr. Livesey rush weather bow. There hands already congregated. A belt fog lifted almost simultaneously appearance moon. Away south-west us saw two low hills, couple miles apart, rising behind one third higher hill, whose peak still buried fog. All three seemed sharp conical figure. So much I saw, almost dream, I yet recovered horrid fear minute two before. And I heard voice Captain Smollett issuing orders. The HISPANIOLA laid couple points nearer wind sailed course would clear island east. “And now, men,” said captain, sheeted home, “has one ever seen land ahead?” “I have, sir,” said Silver. “I have watered trader I cook in.” “The anchorage south, behind islet, I fancy?” asked captain. “Yes, sir; Skeleton Island calls it. It main place pirates once, hand board knowed names it. That hill nor’ard calls Fore-mast Hill; three hills row running south’ard--fore, main, mizzen, sir. But main--that is big un, cloud it--they usually calls Spy-glass, reason lookout kept anchorage cleaning, it is cleaned ships, sir, asking pardon.” “I chart here,” says Captain Smollett. “See that is place.” Long John’s eyes burned his head he took chart, fresh look paper I knew he doomed disappointment. This map found Billy Bones’s chest, accurate copy, complete things--names heights soundings--with single exception red crosses written notes. Sharp must his annoyance, Silver strength mind hide it. “Yes, sir,” said he, “this spot, sure, prettily drawed out. Who might done that, I wonder? The pirates ignorant, I reckon. Aye, is: ‘Capt. Kidd’s Anchorage’--just name shipmate called it. There is strong current runs along south, away nor’ard west coast. Right was, sir,” says he, “to haul wind keep weather island. Leastways, intention enter careen, are not better place waters.” “Thank you, man,” says Captain Smollett. “I will ask later give us help. You may go.” I surprised coolness John avowed his knowledge island, I I half-frightened I saw drawing nearer myself. He know, sure, I overheard his council apple barrel, yet I time taken horror his cruelty, duplicity, power I could scarce conceal shudder he laid his hand upon arm. “Ah,” says he, “this sweet spot, island--a sweet spot lad get ashore on. You will bathe, you will climb trees, you will hunt goats, will; you will get aloft hills like goat yourself. Why, makes young again. I going forget timber leg, I was. It is pleasant thing young ten toes, may lay that. When want go bit exploring, ask old John, he will put snack take along.” And clapping friendliest way upon shoulder, he hobbled forward went below. Captain Smollett, squire, Dr. Livesey talking together quarter-deck, anxious I tell story, I durst interrupt openly. While I still casting thoughts find probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called his side. He left his pipe below, slave tobacco, meant I fetch it; soon I near enough speak overheard, I broke immediately, “Doctor, let speak. Get captain squire cabin, make pretence send me. I terrible news.” The doctor changed countenance little, next moment he master himself. “Thank you, Jim,” said he quite loudly, “that I wanted know,” he asked question. And he turned his heel rejoined two. They spoke together little, though none started, raised his voice, much whistled, plain enough Dr. Livesey communicated request, next thing I heard captain giving order Job Anderson, hands piped deck. “My lads,” said Captain Smollett, “I have word say you. This land sighted place sailing for. Mr. Trelawney, open-handed gentleman, know, asked word two, I able tell every man board done his duty, alow aloft, I never ask see done better, why, he I doctor going cabin drink YOUR health luck, you will grog served drink OUR health luck. I will tell I think this: I think handsome. And think I do, you will give good sea-cheer gentleman it.” The cheer followed--that matter course; rang full hearty I confess I could hardly believe men plotting blood. “One cheer Cap’n Smollett,” cried Long John first subsided. And also given will. On top three gentlemen went below, long after, word sent forward Jim Hawkins wanted cabin. I found three seated round table, bottle Spanish wine raisins them, doctor smoking away, his wig his lap, that, I knew, sign he agitated. The stern window open, warm night, could see moon shining behind ship’s wake. “Now, Hawkins,” said squire, “you something say. Speak up.” I I bid, short I could make it, told whole details Silver’s conversation. Nobody interrupted till I done, one three make much movement, kept eyes upon face first last. “Jim,” said Dr. Livesey, “take seat.” And made sit table beside them, poured glass wine, filled hands raisins, three, one other, bow, drank good health, service me, luck courage. “Now, captain,” said squire, “you right, I wrong. I ass, I await orders.” “No ass I, sir,” returned captain. “I never heard crew meant mutiny showed signs before, man eye his head see mischief take steps according. But crew,” he added, “beats me.” “Captain,” said doctor, “with permission, that is Silver. A remarkable man.” “He would look remarkably well yard-arm, sir,” returned captain. “But talk; do not lead anything. I see three four points, Mr. Trelawney’s permission, I will name them.” “You, sir, captain. It speak,” says Mr. Trelawney grandly. “First point,” began Mr. Smollett. “We must go on, cannot turn back. If I gave word go about, would rise once. Second point, time us--at least treasure’s found. Third point, faithful hands. Now, sir, it is got come blows sooner later, I propose take time forelock, saying is, come blows fine day least expect it. We count, I take it, home servants, Mr. Trelawney?” “As upon myself,” declared squire. “Three,” reckoned captain; “ourselves make seven, counting Hawkins here. Now, honest hands?” “Most likely Trelawney’s men,” said doctor; “those he picked he lit Silver.” “Nay,” replied squire. “Hands one mine.” “I think I could trusted Hands,” added captain. “And think they are Englishmen!” broke squire. “Sir, I could find heart blow ship up.” “Well, gentlemen,” said captain, “the best I say much. We must lay to, please, keep bright lookout. It is trying man, I know. It would pleasanter come blows. But there is help till know men. Lay to, whistle wind, that is view.” “Jim here,” said doctor, “can help us anyone. The men shy him, Jim noticing lad.” “Hawkins, I put prodigious faith you,” added squire. I began feel pretty desperate this, I felt altogether helpless; yet, odd train circumstances, indeed safety came. In meantime, talk pleased, seven twenty-six knew could rely; seven one boy, grown men side six nineteen. PART THREE--My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance island I came deck next morning altogether changed. Although breeze utterly ceased, made great deal way night lying becalmed half mile south-east low eastern coast. Grey-coloured woods covered large part surface. This even tint indeed broken streaks yellow sand-break lower lands, many tall trees pine family, out-topping others--some singly, clumps; general colouring uniform sad. The hills ran clear vegetation spires naked rock. All strangely shaped, Spy-glass, three four hundred feet tallest island, likewise strangest configuration, running sheer almost every side suddenly cut top like pedestal put statue on. The HISPANIOLA rolling scuppers ocean swell. The booms tearing blocks, rudder banging fro, whole ship creaking, groaning, jumping like manufactory. I cling tight backstay, world turned giddily eyes, though I good enough sailor way on, standing still rolled like bottle thing I never learned stand without qualm so, morning, empty stomach. Perhaps this--perhaps look island, grey, melancholy woods, wild stone spires, surf could see hear foaming thundering steep beach--at least, although sun shone bright hot, shore birds fishing crying around us, would thought anyone would glad get land long sea, heart sank, saying is, boots; first look onward, I hated thought Treasure Island. We dreary morning’s work us, sign wind, boats got manned, ship warped three four miles round corner island narrow passage behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered one boats, I had, course, business. The heat sweltering, men grumbled fiercely work. Anderson command boat, instead keeping crew order, he grumbled loud worst. “Well,” he said oath, “it is forever.” I thought bad sign, day men gone briskly willingly business; sight island relaxed cords discipline. All way in, Long John stood steersman conned ship. He knew passage like palm his hand, though man chains got everywhere water chart, John never hesitated once. “There is strong scour ebb,” he said, “and passage dug out, manner speaking, spade.” We brought anchor chart, third mile shore, mainland one side Skeleton Island other. The bottom clean sand. The plunge anchor sent clouds birds wheeling crying woods, less minute silent. The place entirely land-locked, buried woods, trees coming right high-water mark, shores mostly flat, hilltops standing round distance sort amphitheatre, one here, one there. Two little rivers, rather two swamps, emptied pond, might call it; foliage round part shore kind poisonous brightness. From ship could see nothing house stockade, quite buried among trees; chart companion, might first ever anchored since island arose seas. There breath air moving, sound surf booming half mile away along beaches rocks outside. A peculiar stagnant smell hung anchorage--a smell sodden leaves rotting tree trunks. I observed doctor sniffing sniffing, like someone tasting bad egg. “I do not know treasure,” he said, “but I will stake wig there is fever here.” If conduct men alarming boat, became truly threatening come aboard. They lay deck growling together talk. The slightest order received black look grudgingly carelessly obeyed. Even honest hands must caught infection, one man aboard mend another. Mutiny, plain, hung us like thunder-cloud. And cabin party perceived danger. Long John hard work going group group, spending good advice, example man could shown better. He fairly outstripped willingness civility; he smiles everyone. If order given, John would his crutch instant, cheeriest “Aye, aye, sir!” world; nothing else do, he kept one song another, conceal discontent rest. Of gloomy features gloomy afternoon, obvious anxiety part Long John appeared worst. We held council cabin. “Sir,” said captain, “if I risk another order, whole ship’ll come ears run. You see, sir, is. I get rough answer, I not? Well, I speak back, pikes going two shakes; I do not, Silver see there is something that, game’s up. Now, we have one man rely on.” “And that?” asked squire. “Silver, sir,” returned captain; “he is anxious I smother things up. This tiff; he would soon talk  them he chance, I propose give chance. Let us allow men afternoon ashore. If go, we will fight ship. If none go, well then, hold cabin, God defend right. If go, mark words, sir, Silver’ll bring  them aboard mild lambs.” It decided; loaded pistols served sure men; Hunter, Joyce, Redruth taken confidence received news less surprise better spirit looked for, captain went deck addressed crew. “My lads,” said he, “we have hot day tired sorts. A turn ashore’ll hurt nobody--the boats still water; take gigs, many please may go ashore afternoon. I will fire gun half hour sundown.” I believe silly fellows must thought would break shins treasure soon landed, came sulks moment gave cheer started echo faraway hill sent birds flying squalling round anchorage. The captain bright way. He whipped sight moment, leaving Silver arrange party, I fancy well he so. Had he deck, he could longer much pretended understand situation. It plain day. Silver captain, mighty rebellious crew he it. The honest hands--and I soon see proved board--must stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose truth this, hands disaffected example ringleaders--only more, less; few, good fellows main, could neither led driven further. It one thing idle skulk quite another take ship murder number innocent men. At last, however, party made up. Six fellows stay board, remaining thirteen, including Silver, began embark. Then came head first mad notions contributed much save lives. If six men left Silver, plain party could take fight ship; since six left, equally plain cabin party present need assistance. It occurred go ashore. In jiffy I slipped side curled fore-sheets nearest boat, almost moment she shoved off. No one took notice me, bow oar saying, “Is you, Jim? Keep head down.” But Silver, boat, looked sharply called know me; moment I began regret I done. The crews raced beach, boat I in, start lighter better manned, shot far ahead her consort, bow struck among shore-side trees I caught branch swung plunged nearest thicket Silver rest still hundred yards behind. “Jim, Jim!” I heard shouting. But may suppose I paid heed; jumping, ducking, breaking through, I ran straight nose till I could run longer. 14 The First Blow I WAS pleased given slip Long John I began enjoy look around interest strange land I in. I crossed marshy tract full willows, bulrushes, odd, outlandish, swampy trees; I come upon skirts open piece undulating, sandy country, mile long, dotted pines great number contorted trees, unlike oak growth, pale foliage, like willows. On far side open stood one hills, two quaint, craggy peaks shining vividly sun. I felt first time joy exploration. The isle uninhabited; shipmates I left behind, nothing lived front dumb brutes fowls. I turned hither thither among trees. Here flowering plants, unknown me; I saw snakes, one raised his head ledge rock hissed noise unlike spinning top. Little I suppose he deadly enemy noise famous rattle. Then I came long thicket oaklike trees--live, evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards called--which grew low along sand like brambles, boughs curiously twisted, foliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched top one sandy knolls, spreading growing taller went, reached margin broad, reedy fen, nearest little rivers soaked way anchorage. The marsh steaming strong sun, outline Spy-glass trembled haze. All began go sort bustle among bulrushes; wild duck flew quack, another followed, soon whole surface marsh great cloud birds hung screaming circling air. I judged shipmates must drawing near along borders fen. Nor I deceived, soon I heard distant low tones human voice, which, I continued give ear, grew steadily louder nearer. This put great fear, I crawled cover nearest live-oak squatted there, hearkening, silent mouse. Another voice answered, first voice, I recognized Silver’s, took story ran long stream, interrupted other. By sound must talking earnestly, almost fiercely; distinct word came hearing. At last speakers seemed paused perhaps sat down, cease draw nearer, birds began grow quiet settle places swamp. And I began feel I neglecting business, since I foolhardy come ashore desperadoes, least I could overhear councils, plain obvious duty draw close I could manage, favourable ambush crouching trees. I could tell direction speakers pretty exactly, sound voices behaviour birds still hung alarm heads intruders. Crawling fours, I made steadily slowly towards them, till last, raising head aperture among leaves, I could see clear little green dell beside marsh, closely set trees, Long John Silver another crew stood face face conversation. The sun beat full upon them. Silver thrown his hat beside ground, his great, smooth, blond face, shining heat, lifted man’s kind appeal. “Mate,” he saying, “it is I thinks gold dust you--gold dust, may lay that! If I had not took like pitch, think I would a-warning you? All’s up--you cannot make mend; it is save neck I am a-speaking, one wild uns knew it, where did I be, Tom--now, tell me, where did I be?” “Silver,” said man--and I observed he red face, spoke hoarse crow, his voice shook too, like taut rope--“Silver,” says he, “you are old, you are honest, name it; you have money too, lots poor sailors has not; you are brave, I am mistook. And tell you will let led away kind mess swabs? Not you! As sure God sees me, I would sooner lose hand. If I turn agin dooty--” And sudden he interrupted noise. I found one honest hands--well, here, moment, came news another. Far away marsh arose, sudden, sound like cry anger, another back it; one horrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks Spy-glass re-echoed score times; whole troop marsh-birds rose again, darkening heaven, simultaneous whirr; long death yell still ringing brain, silence re-established empire, rustle redescending birds boom distant surges disturbed languor afternoon. Tom leaped sound, like horse spur, Silver winked eye. He stood he was, resting lightly his crutch, watching his companion like snake spring. “John!” said sailor, stretching his hand. “Hands off!” cried Silver, leaping back yard, seemed me, speed security trained gymnast. “Hands off, like, John Silver,” said other. “It is black conscience make feared me. But heaven’s name, tell me, that?” “That?” returned Silver, smiling away, warier ever, his eye mere pin-point his big face, gleaming like crumb glass. “That? Oh, I reckon that will Alan.” And point Tom flashed like hero. “Alan!” he cried. “Then rest his soul true seaman! And you, John Silver, long you have mate mine, you are mate mine more. If I die like dog, I will die dooty. You have killed Alan, you? Kill too, can. But I defies you.” And that, brave fellow turned his back directly cook set walking beach. But he destined go far. With cry John seized branch tree, whipped crutch his armpit, sent uncouth missile hurtling air. It struck poor Tom, point foremost, stunning violence, right shoulders middle his back. His hands flew up, he gave sort gasp, fell. Whether he injured much little, none could ever tell. Like enough, judge sound, his back broken spot. But he time given recover. Silver, agile monkey even without leg crutch, top next moment twice buried his knife hilt defenceless body. From place ambush, I could hear pant aloud he struck blows. I know rightly faint, I know next little whole world swam away whirling mist; Silver birds, tall Spy-glass hilltop, going round round topsy-turvy eyes, manner bells ringing distant voices shouting ear. When I came monster pulled together, his crutch his arm, his hat upon his head. Just Tom lay motionless upon sward; murderer minded whit, cleansing his blood-stained knife upon wisp grass. Everything else unchanged, sun still shining mercilessly steaming marsh tall pinnacle mountain, I could scarce persuade murder actually done human life cruelly cut short moment since eyes. But John put his hand his pocket, brought whistle, blew upon several modulated blasts rang far across heated air. I could tell, course, meaning signal, instantly awoke fears. More men would coming. I might discovered. They already slain two honest people; Tom Alan, might I come next? Instantly I began extricate crawl back again, speed silence I could manage, open portion wood. As I so, I could hear hails coming going old buccaneer his comrades, sound danger lent wings. As soon I clear thicket, I ran I never ran before, scarce minding direction flight, long led murderers; I ran, fear grew grew upon turned kind frenzy. Indeed, could anyone entirely lost I? When gun fired, I dare go boats among fiends, still smoking crime? Would first saw wring neck like snipe’s? Would absence evidence alarm, therefore fatal knowledge? It over, I thought. Good-bye HISPANIOLA; good-bye squire, doctor, captain! There nothing left death starvation death hands mutineers. All while, I say, I still running, without taking notice, I drawn near foot little hill two peaks got part island live-oaks grew widely apart seemed like forest trees bearing dimensions. Mingled scattered pines, fifty, nearer seventy, feet high. The air smelt freshly beside marsh. And fresh alarm brought standstill thumping heart. 15 The Man Island FROM side hill, steep stony, spout gravel dislodged fell rattling bounding trees. My eyes turned instinctively direction, I saw figure leap great rapidity behind trunk pine. What was, whether bear man monkey, I could wise tell. It seemed dark shaggy; I knew not. But terror new apparition brought stand. I now, seemed, cut upon sides; behind murderers, lurking nondescript. And immediately I began prefer dangers I knew I knew not. Silver appeared less terrible contrast creature woods, I turned heel, looking sharply behind shoulder, began retrace steps direction boats. Instantly figure reappeared, making wide circuit, began head off. I tired, rate; I fresh I rose, I could see vain contend speed adversary. From trunk trunk creature flitted like deer, running manlike two legs, unlike man I ever seen, stooping almost double ran. Yet man was, I could longer doubt that. I began recall I heard cannibals. I within ace calling help. But mere fact he man, however wild, somewhat reassured me, fear Silver began revive proportion. I stood still, therefore, cast method escape; I thinking, recollection pistol flashed mind. As soon I remembered I defenceless, courage glowed heart I set face resolutely man island walked briskly towards him. He concealed time behind another tree trunk; he must watching closely, soon I began move his direction he reappeared took step meet me. Then he hesitated, drew back, came forward again, last, wonder confusion, threw his knees held his clasped hands supplication. At I stopped. “Who you?” I asked. “Ben Gunn,” he answered, his voice sounded hoarse awkward, like rusty lock. “I am poor Ben Gunn, I am; I have not spoke Christian three years.” I could see he white man like his features even pleasing. His skin, wherever exposed, burnt sun; even his lips black, his fair eyes looked quite startling dark face. Of beggar-men I seen fancied, he chief raggedness. He clothed tatters old ship’s canvas old sea-cloth, extraordinary patchwork held together system various incongruous fastenings, brass buttons, bits stick, loops tarry gaskin. About his waist he wore old brass-buckled leather belt, one thing solid his whole accoutrement. “Three years!” I cried. “Were shipwrecked?” “Nay, mate,” said he; “marooned.” I heard word, I knew stood horrible kind punishment common enough among buccaneers, offender put ashore little powder shot left behind desolate distant island. “Marooned three years agone,” he continued, “and lived goats since then, berries, oysters. Wherever man is, says I, man himself. But, mate, heart sore Christian diet. You might not happen piece cheese you, now? No? Well, many’s long night I have dreamed cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke again, I were.” “If ever I get aboard again,” said I, “you shall cheese stone.” All time he feeling stuff jacket, smoothing hands, looking boots, generally, intervals his speech, showing childish pleasure presence fellow creature. But last words he perked kind startled slyness. “If ever get aboard again, says you?” he repeated. “Why, now, who is hinder you?” “Not you, I know,” reply. “And right was,” he cried. “Now you--what call yourself, mate?” “Jim,” I told him. “Jim, Jim,” says he, quite pleased apparently. “Well, now, Jim, I have lived rough you would ashamed hear of. Now, instance, would not think I pious mother--to look me?” he asked. “Why, no, particular,” I answered. “Ah, well,” said he, “but I had--remarkable pious. And I civil, pious boy, could rattle catechism fast, could not tell one word another. And here is come to, Jim, begun chuck-farthen blessed grave-stones! That is begun with, went further’n that; mother told me, predicked whole, she did, pious woman! But Providence put here. I have thought lonely island, I am back piety. You do not catch tasting rum much, thimbleful luck, course, first chance I have. I am bound I will good, I see way to. And, Jim”--looking round lowering his voice whisper--“I am rich.” I felt sure poor fellow gone crazy his solitude, I suppose I must shown feeling face, he repeated statement hotly: “Rich! Rich! I says. And I will tell what: I will make man you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you will bless stars, will, first found me!” And came suddenly lowering shadow his face, he tightened his grasp upon hand raised forefinger threateningly eyes. “Now, Jim, tell true: are not Flint’s ship?” he asked. At I happy inspiration. I began believe I found ally, I answered once. “It is Flint’s ship, Flint dead; I will tell true, ask me--there Flint’s hands aboard; worse luck rest us.” “Not man--with one--leg?” he gasped. “Silver?” I asked. “Ah, Silver!” says he. “That his name.” “He is cook, ringleader too.” He still holding wrist, he give quite wring. “If sent Long John,” he said, “I am good pork, I know it. But you, suppose?” I made mind moment, way answer told whole story voyage predicament found ourselves. He heard keenest interest, I done he patted head. “You are good lad, Jim,” he said; “and you are clove hitch, are not you? Well, put trust Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn’s man it. Would think likely, now, squire would prove liberal-minded one case help--him clove hitch, remark?” I told squire liberal men. “Aye, see,” returned Ben Gunn, “I did not mean giving gate keep, suit livery clothes, such; that is mark, Jim. What I mean is, would he likely come toon of, say one thousand pounds money that is good man’s already?” “I sure he would,” said I. “As was, hands share.” “AND passage home?” he added look great shrewdness. “Why,” I cried, “the squire’s gentleman. And besides, got rid others, want help work vessel home.” “Ah,” said he, “so would.” And he seemed much relieved. “Now, I will tell what,” he went on. “So much I will tell you, more. I Flint’s ship he buried treasure; he six along--six strong seamen. They ashore nigh week, us standing old WALRUS. One fine day went signal, come Flint little boat, his head done blue scarf. The sun getting up, mortal white he looked cutwater. But, he was, mind, six dead--dead buried. How he done it, man aboard us could make out. It battle, murder, sudden death, leastways--him six. Billy Bones mate; Long John, he quartermaster; asked treasure was. ‘Ah,’ says he, ‘you go ashore, like, stay,’ he says; ‘but ship, she will beat more, thunder!’ That is he said. “Well, I another ship three years back, sighted island. ‘Boys,’ said I, ‘here is Flint’s treasure; let us land find it.’ The cap’n displeased that, messmates mind landed. Twelve days looked it, every day worse word me, one fine morning hands went aboard. ‘As you, Benjamin Gunn,’ says they, ‘here is musket,’ says, ‘and spade, pick-axe. You stay find Flint’s money yourself,’ says. “Well, Jim, three years I here, bite Christian diet day this. But now, look here; look me. Do I look like man mast? No, says you. Nor I were not, neither, I says.” And he winked pinched hard. “Just mention words squire, Jim,” he went on. “Nor he were not, neither--that is words. Three years he man island, light dark, fair rain; sometimes he would maybe think upon prayer (says you), sometimes he would maybe think his old mother, she is alive (you will say); part Gunn’s time (this you will say)--the part his time took another matter. And you will give nip, like I do.” And he pinched confidential manner. “Then,” he continued, “then you will up, you will say this: Gunn good man (you will say), he puts precious sight confidence--a precious sight, mind that--in gen’leman born gen’leman fortune, one hisself.” “Well,” I said, “I do not understand one word you have saying. But that is neither there; I get board?” “Ah,” said he, “that is hitch, sure. Well, there is boat, I made two hands. I keep her white rock. If worst come worst, might try dark. Hi!” he broke out. “What is that?” For then, although sun still hour two run, echoes island awoke bellowed thunder cannon. “They begun fight!” I cried. “Follow me.” And I began run towards anchorage, terrors forgotten, close side marooned man his goatskins trotted easily lightly. “Left, left,” says he; “keep left hand, mate Jim! Under trees you! Theer’s I killed first goat. They do not come now; they are mastheaded mountings fear Benjamin Gunn. Ah! And there is cetemery”--cemetery, he must meant. “You see mounds? I come prayed, nows thens, I thought maybe Sunday would doo. It were not quite chapel, seemed solemn like; then, says you, Ben Gunn short-handed--no chapling, much Bible flag, says.” So he kept talking I ran, neither expecting receiving answer. The cannon-shot followed considerable interval volley small arms. Another pause, then, quarter mile front me, I beheld Union Jack flutter air wood. PART FOUR--The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued Doctor: How Ship Was Abandoned IT half past one--three bells sea phrase--that two boats went ashore HISPANIOLA. The captain, squire, I talking matters cabin. Had breath wind, fallen six mutineers left aboard us, slipped cable, away sea. But wind wanting; complete helplessness, came Hunter news Jim Hawkins slipped boat gone ashore rest. It never occurred us doubt Jim Hawkins, alarmed his safety. With men temper in, seemed even chance see lad again. We ran deck. The pitch bubbling seams; nasty stench place turned sick; ever man smelt fever dysentery, abominable anchorage. The six scoundrels sitting grumbling sail forecastle; ashore could see gigs made fast man sitting each, hard river runs in. One whistling “Lillibullero.” Waiting strain, decided Hunter I go ashore jolly-boat quest information. The gigs leaned right, Hunter I pulled straight in, direction stockade upon chart. The two left guarding boats seemed bustle appearance; “Lillibullero” stopped off, I could see pair discussing ought do. Had gone told Silver, might turned differently; orders, I suppose, decided sit quietly hark back “Lillibullero.” There slight bend coast, I steered put us; even landed thus lost sight gigs. I jumped came near running I durst, big silk handkerchief hat coolness’ sake brace pistols ready primed safety. I gone hundred yards I reached stockade. This was: spring clear water rose almost top knoll. Well, knoll, enclosing spring, clapped stout loghouse fit hold two score people pinch loopholed musketry either side. All round cleared wide space, thing completed paling six feet high, without door opening, strong pull without time labour open shelter besiegers. The people log-house every way; stood quiet shelter shot others like partridges. All wanted good watch food; for, short complete surprise, might held place regiment. What particularly took fancy spring. For though good enough place cabin HISPANIOLA, plenty arms ammunition, things eat, excellent wines, one thing overlooked--we water. I thinking came ringing island cry man point death. I new violent death--I served his Royal Highness Duke Cumberland, got wound Fontenoy--but I know pulse went dot carry one. “Jim Hawkins gone,” first thought. It something old soldier, still doctor. There time dilly-dally work. And I made mind instantly, time lost returned shore jumped board jolly-boat. By good fortune Hunter pulled good oar. We made water fly, boat soon alongside I aboard schooner. I found shaken, natural. The squire sitting down, white sheet, thinking harm he led us to, good soul! And one six forecastle hands little better. “There is man,” says Captain Smollett, nodding towards him, “new work. He came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, he heard cry. Another touch rudder man would join us.” I told plan captain, us settled details accomplishment. We put old Redruth gallery cabin forecastle, three four loaded muskets mattress protection. Hunter brought boat round stern-port, Joyce I set work loading her powder tins, muskets, bags biscuits, kegs pork, cask cognac, invaluable medicine chest. In meantime, squire captain stayed deck, latter hailed coxswain, principal man aboard. “Mr. Hands,” he said, “here two us brace pistols each. If one six make signal description, man’s dead.” They good deal taken aback, little consultation one tumbled fore companion, thinking doubt take us rear. But saw Redruth waiting sparred galley, went ship once, head popped deck. “Down, dog!” cries captain. And head popped back again; heard more, time, six faint-hearted seamen. By time, tumbling things came, jolly-boat loaded much dared. Joyce I got stern-port, made shore fast oars could take us. This second trip fairly aroused watchers along shore. “Lillibullero” dropped again; lost sight behind little point, one whipped ashore disappeared. I half mind change plan destroy boats, I feared Silver others might close hand, might well lost trying much. We soon touched land place set provision block house. All three made first journey, heavily laden, tossed stores palisade. Then, leaving Joyce guard them--one man, sure, half dozen muskets--Hunter I returned jolly-boat loaded more. So proceeded without pausing take breath, till whole cargo bestowed, two servants took position block house, I, power, sculled back HISPANIOLA. That risked second boat load seems daring really was. They advantage numbers, course, advantage arms. Not one men ashore musket, could get within range pistol shooting, flattered able give good account half-dozen least. The squire waiting stern window, his faintness gone him. He caught painter made fast, fell loading boat lives. Pork, powder, biscuit cargo, musket cutlass apiece squire Redruth captain. The rest arms powder dropped overboard two fathoms half water, could see bright steel shining far us sun, clean, sandy bottom. By time tide beginning ebb, ship swinging round her anchor. Voices heard faintly halloaing direction two gigs; though reassured us Joyce Hunter, well eastward, warned party off. Redruth retreated his place gallery dropped boat, brought round ship’s counter, handier Captain Smollett. “Now, men,” said he, “do hear me?” There answer forecastle. “It is you, Abraham Gray--it is I speaking.” Still reply. “Gray,” resumed Mr. Smollett, little louder, “I leaving ship, I order follow captain. I know good man bottom, I dare say one lot you’s bad he makes out. I watch hand; I give thirty seconds join in.” There pause. “Come, fine fellow,” continued captain; “do not hang long stays. I am risking life lives good gentlemen every second.” There sudden scuffle, sound blows, burst Abraham Gray knife cut side cheek, came running captain like dog whistle. “I am you, sir,” said he. And next moment he captain dropped aboard us, shoved given way. We clear ship, yet ashore stockade. 17 Narrative Continued Doctor: The Jolly-boat’s Last Trip THIS fifth trip quite different others. In first place, little gallipot boat gravely overloaded. Five grown men, three them--Trelawney, Redruth, captain--over six feet high, already she meant carry. Add powder, pork, bread-bags. The gunwale lipping astern. Several times shipped little water, breeches tails coat soaking wet gone hundred yards. The captain made us trim boat, got her lie little evenly. All same, afraid breathe. In second place, ebb making--a strong rippling current running westward basin, south’ard seaward straits entered morning. Even ripples danger overloaded craft, worst swept true course away proper landing-place behind point. If let current way come ashore beside gigs, pirates might appear moment. “I cannot keep her head stockade, sir,” said I captain. I steering, he Redruth, two fresh men, oars. “The tide keeps washing her down. Could pull little stronger?” “Not without swamping boat,” said he. “You must bear up, sir, please--bear see you are gaining.” I tried found experiment tide kept sweeping us westward I laid her head due east, right angles way ought go. “We will never get ashore rate,” said I. “If it is course lie, sir, must even lie it,” returned captain. “We must keep upstream. You see, sir,” he went on, “if dropped leeward landing-place, it is hard say get ashore, besides chance boarded gigs; whereas, way go current must slacken, dodge back along shore.” “The current’s less a’ready, sir,” said man Gray, sitting fore-sheets; “you ease her bit.” “Thank you, man,” said I, quite nothing happened, quietly made minds treat like one ourselves. Suddenly captain spoke again, I thought his voice little changed. “The gun!” said he. “I thought that,” said I, I made sure he thinking bombardment fort. “They could never get gun ashore, did, could never haul woods.” “Look astern, doctor,” replied captain. We entirely forgotten long nine; there, horror, five rogues busy her, getting her jacket, called stout tarpaulin cover she sailed. Not that, flashed mind moment round-shot powder gun left behind, stroke axe would put possession evil ones abroad. “Israel Flint’s gunner,” said Gray hoarsely. At risk, put boat’s head direct landing-place. By time got far run current kept steerage way even necessarily gentle rate rowing, I could keep her steady goal. But worst course I held turned broadside instead stern HISPANIOLA offered target like barn door. I could hear well see brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping round-shot deck. “Who is best shot?” asked captain. “Mr. Trelawney, away,” said I. “Mr. Trelawney, please pick one men, sir? Hands, possible,” said captain. Trelawney cool steel. He looked priming his gun. “Now,” cried captain, “easy gun, sir, you will swamp boat. All hands stand trim her he aims.” The squire raised his gun, rowing ceased, leaned side keep balance, nicely contrived ship drop. They gun, time, slewed round upon swivel, Hands, muzzle rammer, consequence exposed. However, luck, Trelawney fired, he stooped, ball whistled him, one four fell. The cry he gave echoed his companions board great number voices shore, looking direction I saw pirates trooping among trees tumbling places boats. “Here come gigs, sir,” said I. “Give way, then,” cried captain. “We must not mind swamp her now. If cannot get ashore, all’s up.” “Only one gigs manned, sir,” I added; “the crew likely going round shore cut us off.” “They will hot run, sir,” returned captain. “Jack ashore, know. It is I mind; it is round-shot. Carpet bowls! My lady’s maid could not miss. Tell us, squire, see match, we will hold water.” In meanwhile making headway good pace boat overloaded, shipped little water process. We close in; thirty forty strokes beach her, ebb already disclosed narrow belt sand clustering trees. The gig longer feared; little point already concealed eyes. The ebb-tide, cruelly delayed us, making reparation delaying assailants. The one source danger gun. “If I durst,” said captain, “I would stop pick another man.” But plain meant nothing delay shot. They never much looked fallen comrade, though he dead, I could see trying crawl away. “Ready!” cried squire. “Hold!” cried captain, quick echo. And he Redruth backed great heave sent her stern bodily water. The report fell instant time. This first Jim heard, sound squire’s shot reached him. Where ball passed, one us precisely knew, I fancy must heads wind may contributed disaster. At rate, boat sank stern, quite gently, three feet water, leaving captain myself, facing other, feet. The three took complete headers, came drenched bubbling. So far great harm. No lives lost, could wade ashore safety. But stores bottom, make things worse, two guns five remained state service. Mine I snatched knees held head, sort instinct. As captain, he carried his his shoulder bandoleer, like wise man, lock uppermost. The three gone boat. To add concern, heard voices already drawing near us woods along shore, danger cut stockade half-crippled state fear us whether, Hunter Joyce attacked half dozen, would sense conduct stand firm. Hunter steady, knew; Joyce doubtful case--a pleasant, polite man valet brush one’s clothes, entirely fitted man war. With minds, waded ashore fast could, leaving behind us poor jolly-boat good half powder provisions. 18 Narrative Continued Doctor: End First Day’s Fighting WE made best speed across strip wood divided us stockade, every step took voices buccaneers rang nearer. Soon could hear footfalls ran cracking branches breasted across bit thicket. I began see brush earnest looked priming. “Captain,” said I, “Trelawney dead shot. Give gun; his useless.” They exchanged guns, Trelawney, silent cool he since beginning bustle, hung moment his heel see fit service. At time, observing Gray unarmed, I handed cutlass. It hearts good see spit his hand, knit his brows, make blade sing air. It plain every line his body new hand worth his salt. Forty paces farther came edge wood saw stockade front us. We struck enclosure middle south side, almost time, seven mutineers--Job Anderson, boatswain, head--appeared full cry southwestern corner. They paused taken aback, recovered, squire I, Hunter Joyce block house, time fire. The four shots came rather scattering volley, business: one enemy actually fell, rest, without hesitation, turned plunged trees. After reloading, walked outside palisade see fallen enemy. He stone dead--shot heart. We began rejoice good success moment pistol cracked bush, ball whistled close past ear, poor Tom Redruth stumbled fell his length ground. Both squire I returned shot, nothing aim at, probable wasted powder. Then reloaded turned attention poor Tom. The captain Gray already examining him, I saw half eye over. I believe readiness return volley scattered mutineers more, suffered without molestation get poor old gamekeeper hoisted stockade carried, groaning bleeding, log-house. Poor old fellow, he uttered one word surprise, complaint, fear, even acquiescence beginning troubles till now, laid log-house die. He lain like Trojan behind his mattress gallery; he followed every order silently, doggedly, well; he oldest party score years; now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, he die. The squire dropped beside his knees kissed his hand, crying like child. “Be I going, doctor?” he asked. “Tom, man,” said I, “you are going home.” “I wish I lick gun first,” he replied. “Tom,” said squire, “say forgive me, will not you?” “Would respectful like, you, squire?” answer. “Howsoever, it, amen!” After little silence, he said he thought somebody might read prayer. “It is custom, sir,” he added apologetically. And long after, without another word, he passed away. In meantime captain, I observed wonderfully swollen chest pockets, turned great many various stores--the British colours, Bible, coil stoutish rope, pen, ink, log-book, pounds tobacco. He found longish fir-tree lying felled trimmed enclosure, help Hunter he set corner log-house trunks crossed made angle. Then, climbing roof, he his hand bent run colours. This seemed mightily relieve him. He re-entered log-house set counting stores nothing else existed. But he eye Tom’s passage that, soon over, came forward another flag reverently spread body. “Do not take on, sir,” he said, shaking squire’s hand. “All’s well him; fear hand that is shot his duty captain owner. It may not good divinity, it is fact.” Then he pulled aside. “Dr. Livesey,” he said, “in many weeks squire expect consort?” I told question weeks months, back end August Blandly send find us, neither sooner later. “You calculate yourself,” I said. “Why, yes,” returned captain, scratching his head; “and making large allowance, sir, gifts Providence, I say pretty close hauled.” “How mean?” I asked. “It is pity, sir, lost second load. That is I mean,” replied captain. “As powder shot, we will do. But rations short, short--so short, Dr. Livesey, we are perhaps well without extra mouth.” And he pointed dead body flag. Just then, roar whistle, round-shot passed high roof log-house plumped far beyond us wood. “Oho!” said captain. “Blaze away! You have little enough powder already, lads.” At second trial, aim better, ball descended inside stockade, scattering cloud sand damage. “Captain,” said squire, “the house quite invisible ship. It must flag aiming at. Would wiser take in?” “Strike colours!” cried captain. “No, sir, I”; soon he said words, I think agreed him. For piece stout, seamanly, good feeling; good policy besides showed enemies despised cannonade. All evening kept thundering away. Ball ball flew fell short kicked sand enclosure, fire high shot fell dead buried soft sand. We ricochet fear, though one popped roof log-house floor, soon got used sort horse-play minded cricket. “There one good thing this,” observed captain; “the wood front us likely clear. The ebb made good while; stores uncovered. Volunteers go bring pork.” Gray Hunter first come forward. Well armed, stole stockade, proved useless mission. The mutineers bolder fancied put trust Israel’s gunnery. For four five busy carrying stores wading one gigs lay close by, pulling oar hold her steady current. Silver stern-sheets command; every man provided musket secret magazine own. The captain sat his log, beginning entry: Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey, ship’s doctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter’s mate; John Trelawney, owner; John Hunter Richard Joyce, owner’s servants, landsmen--being left faithful ship’s company--with stores ten days short rations, came ashore day flew British colours log-house Treasure Island. Thomas Redruth, owner’s servant, landsman, shot mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy-- And time, I wondering poor Jim Hawkins’ fate. A hail land side. “Somebody hailing us,” said Hunter, guard. “Doctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, you?” came cries. And I ran door time see Jim Hawkins, safe sound, come climbing stockade. 19 Narrative Resumed Jim Hawkins: The Garrison Stockade AS soon Ben Gunn saw colours he came halt, stopped arm, sat down. “Now,” said he, “there is friends, sure enough.” “Far likely it is mutineers,” I answered. “That!” he cried. “Why, place like this, nobody puts gen’lemen fortune, Silver would fly Jolly Roger, do not make doubt that. No, that is friends. There is blows too, I reckon friends best it; ashore old stockade, made years years ago Flint. Ah, he man headpiece, Flint! Barring rum, his match never seen. He afraid none, he; on’y Silver--Silver genteel.” “Well,” said I, “that may so, it; reason I hurry join friends.” “Nay, mate,” returned Ben, “not you. You are good boy, I am mistook; you are on’y boy, told. Now, Ben Gunn fly. Rum would not bring there, you are going--not rum would not, till I see born gen’leman gets his word honour. And will not forget words; ‘A precious sight (that is you will say), precious sight confidence’--and nips him.” And he pinched third time air cleverness. “And Ben Gunn wanted, know find him, Jim. Just wheer found today. And comes white thing his hand, he is come alone. Oh! And you will say this: ‘Ben Gunn,’ says you, ‘has reasons his own.’” “Well,” said I, “I believe I understand. You something propose, wish see squire doctor, you are found I found you. Is all?” “And when? says you,” he added. “Why, noon observation six bells.” “Good,” said I, “and may I go?” “You will not forget?” he inquired anxiously. “Precious sight, reasons his own, says you. Reasons his own; that is mainstay; man man. Well, then”--still holding me--“I reckon go, Jim. And, Jim, see Silver, would not go sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses would not draw you? No, says you. And pirates camp ashore, Jim, would say there would widders morning?” Here he interrupted loud report, cannonball came tearing trees pitched sand hundred yards two talking. The next moment us taken his heels different direction. For good hour come frequent reports shook island, balls kept crashing woods. I moved hiding-place hiding-place, always pursued, seemed me, terrifying missiles. But towards end bombardment, though still I durst venture direction stockade, balls fell oftenest, I begun, manner, pluck heart again, long detour east, crept among shore-side trees. The sun set, sea breeze rustling tumbling woods ruffling grey surface anchorage; tide, too, far out, great tracts sand lay uncovered; air, heat day, chilled jacket. The HISPANIOLA still lay she anchored; but, sure enough, Jolly Roger--the black flag piracy--flying her peak. Even I looked, came another red flash another report sent echoes clattering, one round-shot whistled air. It last cannonade. I lay time watching bustle succeeded attack. Men demolishing something axes beach near stockade--the poor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away, near mouth river, great fire glowing among trees, point ship one gigs kept coming going, men, I seen gloomy, shouting oars like children. But sound voices suggested rum. At length I thought I might return towards stockade. I pretty far low, sandy spit encloses anchorage east, joined half-water Skeleton Island; now, I rose feet, I saw, distance spit rising among low bushes, isolated rock, pretty high, peculiarly white colour. It occurred might white rock Ben Gunn spoken day boat might wanted I know look one. Then I skirted among woods I regained rear, shoreward side, stockade, soon warmly welcomed faithful party. I soon told story began look me. The log-house made unsquared trunks pine--roof, walls, floor. The latter stood several places much foot foot half surface sand. There porch door, porch little spring welled artificial basin rather odd kind--no great ship’s kettle iron, bottom knocked out, sunk “to her bearings,” captain said, among sand. Little left besides framework house, one corner stone slab laid way hearth old rusty iron basket contain fire. The slopes knoll inside stockade cleared timber build house, could see stumps fine lofty grove destroyed. Most soil washed away buried drift removal trees; streamlet ran kettle thick bed moss ferns little creeping bushes still green among sand. Very close around stockade--too close defence, said--the wood still flourished high dense, fir land side, towards sea large admixture live-oaks. The cold evening breeze, I spoken, whistled every chink rude building sprinkled floor continual rain fine sand. There sand eyes, sand teeth, sand suppers, sand dancing spring bottom kettle, world like porridge beginning boil. Our chimney square hole roof; little part smoke found way out, rest eddied house kept us coughing piping eye. Add Gray, new man, his face tied bandage cut he got breaking away mutineers poor old Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along wall, stiff stark, Union Jack. If allowed sit idle, fallen blues, Captain Smollett never man that. All hands called him, he divided us watches. The doctor Gray I one; squire, Hunter, Joyce upon other. Tired though were, two sent firewood; two set dig grave Redruth; doctor named cook; I put sentry door; captain went one another, keeping spirits lending hand wherever wanted. From time time doctor came door little air rest his eyes, almost smoked his head, whenever he so, he word me. “That man Smollett,” he said once, “is better man I am. And I say means deal, Jim.” Another time he came silent while. Then he put his head one side, looked me. “Is Ben Gunn man?” he asked. “I know, sir,” said I. “I sure whether he is sane.” “If there is doubt matter, he is,” returned doctor. “A man three years biting his nails desert island, Jim, cannot expect appear sane me. It does not lie human nature. Was cheese said he fancy for?” “Yes, sir, cheese,” I answered. “Well, Jim,” says he, “just see good comes dainty food. You have seen snuff-box, have not you? And never saw take snuff, reason snuff-box I carry piece Parmesan cheese--a cheese made Italy, nutritious. Well, that is Ben Gunn!” Before supper eaten buried old Tom sand stood round bare-headed breeze. A good deal firewood got in, enough captain’s fancy, he shook his head told us “must get back tomorrow rather livelier.” Then, eaten pork good stiff glass brandy grog, three chiefs got together corner discuss prospects. It appears wits’ end do, stores low must starved surrender long help came. But best hope, decided, kill buccaneers either hauled flag ran away HISPANIOLA. From nineteen already reduced fifteen, two others wounded, one least--the man shot beside gun--severely wounded, he dead. Every time crack them, take it, saving lives, extremest care. And besides that, two able allies--rum climate. As first, though half mile away, could hear roaring singing late night; second, doctor staked his wig that, camped marsh unprovided remedies, half would backs week. “So,” he added, “if shot first they will glad packing schooner. It is always ship, get buccaneering again, I suppose.” “First ship ever I lost,” said Captain Smollett. I dead tired, may fancy; I got sleep, till great deal tossing, I slept like log wood. The rest long already breakfasted increased pile firewood half much I wakened bustle sound voices. “Flag truce!” I heard someone say; then, immediately after, cry surprise, “Silver himself!” And that, I jumped, rubbing eyes, ran loophole wall. 20 Silver’s Embassy SURE enough, two men outside stockade, one waving white cloth, other, less person Silver himself, standing placidly by. It still quite early, coldest morning I think I ever abroad in--a chill pierced marrow. The sky bright cloudless overhead, tops trees shone rosily sun. But Silver stood his lieutenant, still shadow, waded knee-deep low white vapour crawled night morass. The chill vapour taken together told poor tale island. It plainly damp, feverish, unhealthy spot. “Keep indoors, men,” said captain. “Ten one trick.” Then he hailed buccaneer. “Who goes? Stand, fire.” “Flag truce,” cried Silver. The captain porch, keeping carefully way treacherous shot, intended. He turned spoke us, “Doctor’s watch lookout. Dr. Livesey take north side, please; Jim, east; Gray, west. The watch below, hands load muskets. Lively, men, careful.” And he turned mutineers. “And want flag truce?” he cried. This time man replied. “Cap’n Silver, sir, come board make terms,” he shouted. “Cap’n Silver! Do not know him. Who is he?” cried captain. And could hear adding himself, “Cap’n, it? My heart, here is promotion!” Long John answered himself. “Me, sir. These poor lads chosen cap’n, desertion, sir”--laying particular emphasis upon word “desertion.” “We are willing submit, come terms, bones it. All I ask word, Cap’n Smollett, let safe sound stockade, one minute get shot gun fired.” “My man,” said Captain Smollett, “I slightest desire talk you. If wish talk me, come, that is all. If there is treachery, it will side, Lord help you.” “That is enough, cap’n,” shouted Long John cheerily. “A word you’s enough. I know gentleman, may lay that.” We could see man carried flag truce attempting hold Silver back. Nor wonderful, seeing cavalier captain’s answer. But Silver laughed aloud slapped back idea alarm absurd. Then he advanced stockade, threw his crutch, got leg up, great vigour skill succeeded surmounting fence dropping safely side. I confess I far much taken going slightest use sentry; indeed, I already deserted eastern loophole crept behind captain, seated threshold, his elbows his knees, his head his hands, his eyes fixed water bubbled old iron kettle sand. He whistling “Come, Lasses Lads.” Silver terrible hard work getting knoll. What steepness incline, thick tree stumps, soft sand, he his crutch helpless ship stays. But he stuck like man silence, last arrived captain, he saluted handsomest style. He tricked his best; immense blue coat, thick brass buttons, hung low his knees, fine laced hat set back his head. “Here are, man,” said captain, raising his head. “You better sit down.” “You are not a-going let inside, cap’n?” complained Long John. “It is main cold morning, sure, sir, sit outside upon sand.” “Why, Silver,” said captain, “if pleased honest man, might sitting galley. It is doing. You are either ship’s cook--and treated handsome--or Cap’n Silver, common mutineer pirate, go hang!” “Well, well, cap’n,” returned sea-cook, sitting he bidden sand, “you will give hand again, that is all. A sweet pretty place here. Ah, there is Jim! The top morning you, Jim. Doctor, here is service. Why, together like happy family, manner speaking.” “If anything say, man, better say it,” said captain. “Right were, Cap’n Smollett,” replied Silver. “Dooty dooty, sure. Well now, look here, good lay last night. I do not deny good lay. Some pretty handy handspike-end. And I will deny neither people shook--maybe shook; maybe I shook myself; maybe that is I am terms. But mark me, cap’n, will not twice, thunder! We will sentry-go ease point rum. Maybe think sheet wind’s eye. But I will tell I sober; I on’y dog tired; I would awoke second sooner, I would ’a caught act, I would. He was not dead I got round him, he.” “Well?” says Captain Smollett cool be. All Silver said riddle him, would never guessed his tone. As me, I began inkling. Ben Gunn’s last words came back mind. I began suppose he paid buccaneers visit lay drunk together round fire, I reckoned glee fourteen enemies deal with. “Well, is,” said Silver. “We want treasure, we will it--that is point! You would soon save lives, I reckon; that is yours. You chart, have not you?” “That is may be,” replied captain. “Oh, well, have, I know that,” returned Long John. “You need not husky man; are not particle service that, may lay it. What I mean is, want chart. Now, I never meant harm, myself.” “That will not me, man,” interrupted captain. “We know exactly meant do, do not care, now, see, cannot it.” And captain looked calmly proceeded fill pipe. “If Abe Gray--” Silver broke out. “Avast there!” cried Mr. Smollett. “Gray told nothing, I asked nothing; what is more, I would see whole island blown clean water blazes first. So there is mind you, man, that.” This little whiff temper seemed cool Silver down. He growing nettled before, he pulled together. “Like enough,” said he. “I would set limits gentlemen might consider shipshape, might not, case were. And seein’ take pipe, cap’n, I will make free likewise.” And he filled pipe lighted it; two men sat silently smoking quite while, looking face, stopping tobacco, leaning forward spit. It good play see them. “Now,” resumed Silver, “here is. You give us chart get treasure by, drop shooting poor seamen stoving heads asleep. You that, we will offer choice. Either come aboard along us, treasure shipped, I will give affy-davy, upon word honour, clap somewhere safe ashore. Or are not fancy, hands rough old scores account hazing, stay here, can. We will divide stores you, man man; I will give affy-davy, speak first ship I sight, send  them pick up. Now, you will that is talking. Handsomer could not look get, you. And I hope”--raising his voice--“that hands block house overhaul words, spoke one spoke all.” Captain Smollett rose his seat knocked ashes his pipe palm his left hand. “Is all?” he asked. “Every last word, thunder!” answered John. “Refuse that, you have seen last musket-balls.” “Very good,” said captain. “Now you will hear me. If you will come one one, unarmed, I will engage clap irons take home fair trial England. If will not, name Alexander Smollett, I have flown sovereign’s colours, I will see Davy Jones. You cannot find treasure. You cannot sail ship--there is man among fit sail ship. You cannot fight us--Gray, there, got away five you. Your ship’s irons, Master Silver; you are lee shore, you will find. I stand tell so; they are last good words you will get me, name heaven, I will put bullet back next I meet you. Tramp, lad. Bundle this, please, hand hand, double quick.” Silver’s face picture; his eyes started his head wrath. He shook fire his pipe. “Give hand up!” he cried. “Not I,” returned captain. “Who will give hand up?” he roared. Not man among us moved. Growling foulest imprecations, he crawled along sand till he got hold porch could hoist upon his crutch. Then he spat spring. “There!” he cried. “That is I think ye. Before hour’s out, I will stove old block house like rum puncheon. Laugh, thunder, laugh! Before hour’s out, ye’ll laugh upon side. Them die’ll lucky ones.” And dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed sand, helped across stockade, four five failures, man flag truce, disappeared instant afterwards among trees. 21 The Attack AS soon Silver disappeared, captain, closely watching him, turned towards interior house found man us his post Gray. It first time ever seen angry. “Quarters!” he roared. And then, slunk back places, “Gray,” he said, “I will put name log; you have stood duty like seaman. Mr. Trelawney, I am surprised you, sir. Doctor, I thought worn king’s coat! If served Fontenoy, sir, you would better berth.” The doctor’s watch back loopholes, rest busy loading spare muskets, everyone red face, may certain, flea his ear, saying is. The captain looked silence. Then he spoke. “My lads,” said he, “I have given Silver broadside. I pitched red-hot purpose; hour’s out, he said, shall boarded. We are outnumbered, I need not tell that, fight shelter; minute ago I said fought discipline. I have manner doubt drub them, choose.” Then he went rounds saw, he said, clear. On two short sides house, east west, two loopholes; south side porch was, two again; north side, five. There round score muskets seven us; firewood built four piles--tables, might say--one middle side, tables ammunition four loaded muskets laid ready hand defenders. In middle, cutlasses lay ranged. “Toss fire,” said captain; “the chill past, must not smoke eyes.” The iron fire-basket carried bodily Mr. Trelawney, embers smothered among sand. “Hawkins has not his breakfast. Hawkins, help yourself, back post eat it,” continued Captain Smollett. “Lively, now, lad; you will want you have done. Hunter, serve round brandy hands.” And going on, captain completed, his mind, plan defence. “Doctor, take door,” he resumed. “See, do not expose yourself; keep within, fire porch. Hunter, take east side, there. Joyce, stand west, man. Mr. Trelawney, best shot--you Gray take long north side, five loopholes; it is danger is. If get fire upon us ports, things would begin look dirty. Hawkins, neither I much account shooting; we will stand load bear hand.” As captain said, chill past. As soon sun climbed girdle trees, fell force upon clearing drank vapours draught. Soon sand baking resin melting logs block house. Jackets coats flung aside, shirts thrown open neck rolled shoulders; stood there, his post, fever heat anxiety. An hour passed away. “Hang them!” said captain. “This dull doldrums. Gray, whistle wind.” And moment came first news attack. “If please, sir,” said Joyce, “if I see anyone, I fire?” “I told so!” cried captain. “Thank you, sir,” returned Joyce quiet civility. Nothing followed time, remark set us alert, straining ears eyes--the musketeers pieces balanced hands, captain middle block house his mouth tight frown his face. So seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped his musket fired. The report scarcely died away ere repeated repeated without scattering volley, shot behind shot, like string geese, every side enclosure. Several bullets struck log-house, one entered; smoke cleared away vanished, stockade woods around looked quiet empty before. Not bough waved, gleam musket-barrel betrayed presence foes. “Did hit man?” asked captain. “No, sir,” replied Joyce. “I believe not, sir.” “Next best thing tell truth,” muttered Captain Smollett. “Load his gun, Hawkins. How many say side, doctor?” “I know precisely,” said Dr. Livesey. “Three shots fired side. I saw three flashes--two close together--one farther west.” “Three!” repeated captain. “And many yours, Mr. Trelawney?” But easily answered. There come many north--seven squire’s computation, eight nine according Gray. From east west single shot fired. It plain, therefore, attack would developed north three sides annoyed show hostilities. But Captain Smollett made change his arrangements. If mutineers succeeded crossing stockade, he argued, would take possession unprotected loophole shoot us like rats stronghold. Nor much time left us thought. Suddenly, loud huzza, little cloud pirates leaped woods north side ran straight stockade. At moment, fire opened woods, rifle ball sang doorway knocked doctor’s musket bits. The boarders swarmed fence like monkeys. Squire Gray fired yet again; three men fell, one forwards enclosure, two back outside. But these, one evidently frightened hurt, he his feet crack instantly disappeared among trees. Two bit dust, one fled, four made good footing inside defences, shelter woods seven eight men, evidently supplied several muskets, kept hot though useless fire log-house. The four boarded made straight building, shouting ran, men among trees shouted back encourage them. Several shots fired, hurry marksmen one appears taken effect. In moment, four pirates swarmed mound upon us. The head Job Anderson, boatswain, appeared middle loophole. “At  them, hands--all hands!” he roared voice thunder. At moment, another pirate grasped Hunter’s musket muzzle, wrenched his hands, plucked loophole, one stunning blow, laid poor fellow senseless floor. Meanwhile third, running unharmed around house, appeared suddenly doorway fell his cutlass doctor. Our position utterly reversed. A moment since firing, cover, exposed enemy; lay uncovered could return blow. The log-house full smoke, owed comparative safety. Cries confusion, flashes reports pistol-shots, one loud groan rang ears. “Out, lads, out, fight  them open! Cutlasses!” cried captain. I snatched cutlass pile, someone, time snatching another, gave cut across knuckles I hardly felt. I dashed door clear sunlight. Someone close behind, I knew whom. Right front, doctor pursuing his assailant hill, eyes fell upon him, beat his guard sent sprawling his back great slash across face. “Round house, lads! Round house!” cried captain; even hurly-burly, I perceived change his voice. Mechanically, I obeyed, turned eastwards, cutlass raised, ran round corner house. Next moment I face face Anderson. He roared aloud, his hanger went his head, flashing sunlight. I time afraid, blow still hung impending, leaped trice upon one side, missing foot soft sand, rolled headlong slope. When I first sallied door, mutineers already swarming palisade make end us. One man, red night-cap, his cutlass his mouth, even got upon top thrown leg across. Well, short interval I found feet posture, fellow red night-cap still half-way over, another still showing his head top stockade. And yet, breath time, fight victory ours. Gray, following close behind me, cut big boatswain ere he time recover his last blow. Another shot loophole act firing house lay agony, pistol still smoking his hand. A third, I seen, doctor disposed blow. Of four scaled palisade, one remained unaccounted for, he, left his cutlass field, clambering fear death upon him. “Fire--fire house!” cried doctor. “And you, lads, back cover.” But his words unheeded, shot fired, last boarder made good his escape disappeared rest wood. In three seconds nothing remained attacking party five fallen, four inside one outside palisade. The doctor Gray I ran full speed shelter. The survivors would soon back left muskets, moment fire might recommence. The house time somewhat cleared smoke, saw glance price paid victory. Hunter lay beside his loophole, stunned; Joyce his, shot head, never move again; right centre, squire supporting captain, one pale other. “The captain’s wounded,” said Mr. Trelawney. “Have run?” asked Mr. Smollett. “All could, may bound,” returned doctor; “but there is five never run again.” “Five!” cried captain. “Come, that is better. Five three leaves us four nine. That is better odds starting. We seven nineteen then, thought were, that is bad bear.” * *The mutineers soon eight number, man shot Mr. Trelawney board schooner died evening his wound. But was, course, known till faithful party. PART FIVE--My Sea Adventure 22 How My Sea Adventure Began THERE return mutineers--not much another shot woods. They “got rations day,” captain put it, place quiet time overhaul wounded get dinner. Squire I cooked outside spite danger, even outside could hardly tell at, horror loud groans reached us doctor’s patients. Out eight men fallen action, three still breathed--that one pirates shot loophole, Hunter, Captain Smollett; these, first two good dead; mutineer indeed died doctor’s knife, Hunter, could, never recovered consciousness world. He lingered day, breathing loudly like old buccaneer home his apoplectic fit, bones his chest crushed blow his skull fractured falling, time following night, without sign sound, he went his Maker. As captain, his wounds grievous indeed, dangerous. No organ fatally injured. Anderson’s ball--for Job shot first--had broken his shoulder-blade touched lung, badly; second torn displaced muscles calf. He sure recover, doctor said, meantime, weeks come, he must walk move his arm, much speak he could help it. My accidental cut across knuckles flea-bite. Doctor Livesey patched plaster pulled ears bargain. After dinner squire doctor sat captain’s side awhile consultation; talked hearts’ content, little past noon, doctor took his hat pistols, girt cutlass, put chart his pocket, musket his shoulder crossed palisade north side set briskly trees. Gray I sitting together far end block house, earshot officers consulting; Gray took his pipe his mouth fairly forgot put back again, thunder-struck he occurrence. “Why, name Davy Jones,” said he, “is Dr. Livesey mad?” “Why no,” says I. “He is last crew that, I take it.” “Well, shipmate,” said Gray, “mad he may be; HE IS not, mark words, I am.” “I take it,” replied I, “the doctor his idea; I right, he is going see Ben Gunn.” I right, appeared later; meantime, house stifling hot little patch sand inside palisade ablaze midday sun, I began get another thought head, means right. What I began envy doctor walking cool shadow woods birds pleasant smell pines, I sat grilling, clothes stuck hot resin, much blood many poor dead bodies lying around I took disgust place almost strong fear. All time I washing block house, washing things dinner, disgust envy kept growing stronger stronger, till last, near bread-bag, one observing me, I took first step towards escapade filled pockets coat biscuit. I fool, like, certainly I going foolish, over-bold act; I determined precautions power. These biscuits, anything befall me, would keep me, least, starving till far next day. The next thing I laid hold brace pistols, I already powder-horn bullets, I felt well supplied arms. As scheme I head, bad one itself. I go sandy spit divides anchorage east open sea, find white rock I observed last evening, ascertain whether Ben Gunn hidden his boat, thing quite worth doing, I still believe. But I certain I allowed leave enclosure, plan take French leave slip nobody watching, bad way made thing wrong. But I boy, I made mind up. Well, things last fell out, I found admirable opportunity. The squire Gray busy helping captain his bandages, coast clear, I made bolt stockade thickest trees, absence observed I cry companions. This second folly, far worse first, I left two sound men guard house; like first, help towards saving us. I took way straight east coast island, I determined go sea side spit avoid chance observation anchorage. It already late afternoon, although still warm sunny. As I continued thread tall woods, I could hear far continuous thunder surf, certain tossing foliage grinding boughs showed sea breeze set higher usual. Soon cool draughts air began reach me, steps farther I came forth open borders grove, saw sea lying blue sunny horizon surf tumbling tossing foam along beach. I never seen sea quiet round Treasure Island. The sun might blaze overhead, air without breath, surface smooth blue, still great rollers would running along external coast, thundering thundering day night; I scarce believe one spot island man would earshot noise. I walked along beside surf great enjoyment, till, thinking I got far enough south, I took cover thick bushes crept warily ridge spit. Behind sea, front anchorage. The sea breeze, though sooner blown unusual violence, already end; succeeded light, variable airs south south-east, carrying great banks fog; anchorage, lee Skeleton Island, lay still leaden first entered it. The HISPANIOLA, unbroken mirror, exactly portrayed truck waterline, Jolly Roger hanging her peak. Alongside lay one gigs, Silver stern-sheets--him I could always recognize--while couple men leaning stern bulwarks, one red cap--the rogue I seen hours stride-legs upon palisade. Apparently talking laughing, though distance--upwards mile--I could, course, hear word said. All began horrid, unearthly screaming, first startled badly, though I soon remembered voice Captain Flint even thought I could make bird her bright plumage she sat perched upon her master’s wrist. Soon after, jolly-boat shoved pulled shore, man red cap his comrade went cabin companion. Just time, sun gone behind Spy-glass, fog collecting rapidly, began grow dark earnest. I saw I must lose time I find boat evening. The white rock, visible enough brush, still eighth mile spit, took goodish get it, crawling, often fours, among scrub. Night almost come I laid hand rough sides. Right exceedingly small hollow green turf, hidden banks thick underwood knee-deep, grew plentifully; centre dell, sure enough, little tent goat-skins, like gipsies carry England. I dropped hollow, lifted side tent, Ben Gunn’s boat--home-made ever anything home-made; rude, lop-sided framework tough wood, stretched upon covering goat-skin, hair inside. The thing extremely small, even me, I hardly imagine could floated full-sized man. There one thwart set low possible, kind stretcher bows, double paddle propulsion. I seen coracle, ancient Britons made, I seen one since, I give fairer idea Ben Gunn’s boat saying like first worst coracle ever made man. But great advantage coracle certainly possessed, exceedingly light portable. Well, I found boat, would thought I enough truantry once, meantime I taken another notion become obstinately fond I would carried out, I believe, teeth Captain Smollett himself. This slip cover night, cut HISPANIOLA adrift, let her go ashore she fancied. I quite made mind mutineers, repulse morning, nothing nearer hearts anchor away sea; this, I thought, would fine thing prevent, I seen left watchmen unprovided boat, I thought might done little risk. Down I sat wait darkness, made hearty meal biscuit. It night ten thousand purpose. The fog buried heaven. As last rays daylight dwindled disappeared, absolute blackness settled Treasure Island. And when, last, I shouldered coracle groped way stumblingly hollow I supped, two points visible whole anchorage. One great fire shore, defeated pirates lay carousing swamp. The other, mere blur light upon darkness, indicated position anchored ship. She swung round ebb--her bow towards me--the lights board cabin, I saw merely reflection fog strong rays flowed stern window. The ebb already run time, I wade long belt swampy sand, I sank several times ankle, I came edge retreating water, wading little way in, strength dexterity, set coracle, keel downwards, surface. 23 The Ebb-tide Runs THE coracle--as I ample reason know I done her--was safe boat person height weight, buoyant clever seaway; she cross-grained, lop-sided craft manage. Do pleased, she always made leeway anything else, turning round round manoeuvre she best at. Even Ben Gunn admitted she “queer handle till knew her way.” Certainly I know her way. She turned every direction one I bound go; part time broadside on, I sure I never made ship tide. By good fortune, paddle I pleased, tide still sweeping down; lay HISPANIOLA right fairway, hardly missed. First she loomed like blot something yet blacker darkness, her spars hull began take shape, next moment, seemed (for, farther I went, brisker grew current ebb), I alongside her hawser laid hold. The hawser taut bowstring, current strong she pulled upon her anchor. All round hull, blackness, rippling current bubbled chattered like little mountain stream. One cut sea-gully HISPANIOLA would go humming tide. So far good, next occurred recollection taut hawser, suddenly cut, thing dangerous kicking horse. Ten one, I foolhardy cut HISPANIOLA her anchor, I coracle would knocked clean water. This brought full stop, fortune particularly favoured me, I abandon design. But light airs begun blowing south-east south hauled round nightfall south-west. Just I meditating, puff came, caught HISPANIOLA, forced her current; great joy, I felt hawser slacken grasp, hand I held dip second water. With I made mind up, took gully, opened teeth, cut one strand another, till vessel swung two. Then I lay quiet, waiting sever last strain lightened breath wind. All time I heard sound loud voices cabin, say truth, mind entirely taken thoughts I scarcely given ear. Now, however, I nothing else do, I began pay heed. One I recognized coxswain’s, Israel Hands, Flint’s gunner former days. The was, course, friend red night-cap. Both men plainly worse drink, still drinking, even I listening, one them, drunken cry, opened stern window threw something, I divined empty bottle. But tipsy; plain furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, every came forth explosion I thought sure end blows. But time quarrel passed voices grumbled lower while, next crisis came turn passed away without result. On shore, I could see glow great camp-fire burning warmly shore-side trees. Someone singing, dull, old, droning sailor’s song, droop quaver end every verse, seemingly end patience singer. I heard voyage remembered words: “But one man her crew alive, What put sea seventy-five.” And I thought ditty rather dolefully appropriate company met cruel losses morning. But, indeed, I saw, buccaneers callous sea sailed on. At last breeze came; schooner sidled drew nearer dark; I felt hawser slacken more, good, tough effort, cut last fibres through. The breeze little action coracle, I almost instantly swept bows HISPANIOLA. At time, schooner began turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end end, across current. I wrought like fiend, I expected every moment swamped; since I found I could push coracle directly off, I shoved straight astern. At length I clear dangerous neighbour, I gave last impulsion, hands came across light cord trailing overboard across stern bulwarks. Instantly I grasped it. Why I done I hardly say. It first mere instinct, I hands found fast, curiosity began get upper hand, I determined I one look cabin window. I pulled hand hand cord, I judged near enough, rose infinite risk half height thus commanded roof slice interior cabin. By time schooner her little consort gliding pretty swiftly water; indeed, already fetched level camp-fire. The ship talking, sailors say, loudly, treading innumerable ripples incessant weltering splash; I got eye window-sill I could comprehend watchmen taken alarm. One glance, however, sufficient; one glance I durst take unsteady skiff. It showed Hands his companion locked together deadly wrestle, hand upon other’s throat. I dropped upon thwart again, none soon, I near overboard. I could see nothing moment two furious, encrimsoned faces swaying together smoky lamp, I shut eyes let grow familiar darkness. The endless ballad come end last, whole diminished company camp-fire broken chorus I heard often: “Fifteen men dead man’s chest-- Yo-ho-ho, bottle rum! Drink devil done rest-- Yo-ho-ho, bottle rum!” I thinking busy drink devil moment cabin HISPANIOLA, I surprised sudden lurch coracle. At moment, she yawed sharply seemed change her course. The speed meantime strangely increased. I opened eyes once. All round little ripples, combing sharp, bristling sound slightly phosphorescent. The HISPANIOLA herself, yards whose wake I still whirled along, seemed stagger her course, I saw her spars toss little blackness night; nay, I looked longer, I made sure she also wheeling southward. I glanced shoulder, heart jumped ribs. There, right behind me, glow camp-fire. The current turned right angles, sweeping round along tall schooner little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever muttering louder, went spinning narrows open sea. Suddenly schooner front gave violent yaw, turning, perhaps, twenty degrees; almost moment one shout followed another board; I could hear feet pounding companion ladder I knew two drunkards last interrupted quarrel awakened sense disaster. I lay flat bottom wretched skiff devoutly recommended spirit Maker. At end straits, I made sure must fall bar raging breakers, troubles would ended speedily; though I could, perhaps, bear die, I could bear look upon fate approached. So I must lain hours, continually beaten fro upon billows, wetted flying sprays, never ceasing expect death next plunge. Gradually weariness grew upon me; numbness, occasional stupor, fell upon mind even midst terrors, sleep last supervened sea-tossed coracle I lay dreamed home old Admiral Benbow. 24 The Cruise Coracle IT broad day I awoke found tossing south-west end Treasure Island. The sun still hid behind great bulk Spy-glass, side descended almost sea formidable cliffs. Haulbowline Head Mizzen-mast Hill elbow, hill bare dark, head bound cliffs forty fifty feet high fringed great masses fallen rock. I scarce quarter mile seaward, first thought paddle land. That notion soon given over. Among fallen rocks breakers spouted bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying falling, succeeded one another second second; I saw myself, I ventured nearer, dashed death upon rough shore spending strength vain scale beetling crags. Nor all, crawling together flat tables rock letting drop sea loud reports I beheld huge slimy monsters--soft snails, were, incredible bigness--two three score together, making rocks echo barkings. I understood since sea lions, entirely harmless. But look them, added difficulty shore high running surf, enough disgust landing-place. I felt willing rather starve sea confront perils. In meantime I better chance, I supposed, me. North Haulbowline Head, land runs long way, leaving low tide long stretch yellow sand. To north that, again, comes another cape--Cape Woods, marked upon chart--buried tall green pines, descended margin sea. I remembered Silver said current sets northward along whole west coast Treasure Island, seeing position I already influence, I preferred leave Haulbowline Head behind reserve strength attempt land upon kindlier-looking Cape Woods. There great, smooth swell upon sea. The wind blowing steady gentle south, contrariety current, billows rose fell unbroken. Had otherwise, I must long ago perished; was, surprising easily securely little light boat could ride. Often, I still lay bottom kept eye gunwale, I would see big blue summit heaving close me; yet coracle would bounce little, dance springs, subside side trough lightly bird. I began little grow bold sat try skill paddling. But even small change disposition weight produce violent changes behaviour coracle. And I hardly moved boat, giving her gentle dancing movement, ran straight slope water steep made giddy, struck her nose, spout spray, deep side next wave. I drenched terrified, fell instantly back old position, whereupon coracle seemed find her head led softly among billows. It plain she interfered with, rate, since I could way influence her course, hope I left reaching land? I began horribly frightened, I kept head, that. First, moving care, I gradually baled coracle sea-cap; then, getting eye gunwale, I set study she managed slip quietly rollers. I found wave, instead big, smooth glossy mountain looks shore vessel’s deck, world like range hills dry land, full peaks smooth places valleys. The coracle, left herself, turning side side, threaded, speak, her way lower parts avoided steep slopes higher, toppling summits wave. “Well, now,” thought I myself, “it plain I must lie I disturb balance; plain also I put paddle side time time, smooth places, give her shove two towards land.” No sooner thought upon done. There I lay elbows trying attitude, every gave weak stroke two turn her head shore. It tiring slow work, yet I visibly gain ground; drew near Cape Woods, though I saw I must infallibly miss point, I still made hundred yards easting. I was, indeed, close in. I could see cool green tree-tops swaying together breeze, I felt sure I make next promontory without fail. It high time, I began tortured thirst. The glow sun above, thousandfold reflection waves, sea-water fell dried upon me, caking lips salt, combined make throat burn brain ache. The sight trees near hand almost made sick longing, current soon carried past point, next reach sea opened out, I beheld sight changed nature thoughts. Right front me, half mile away, I beheld HISPANIOLA sail. I made sure, course, I taken; I distressed want water I scarce knew whether glad sorry thought, long I come conclusion, surprise taken entire possession mind I could nothing stare wonder. The HISPANIOLA her main-sail two jibs, beautiful white canvas shone sun like snow silver. When I first sighted her, her sails drawing; she lying course north-west, I presumed men board going round island way back anchorage. Presently she began fetch westward, I thought sighted going chase. At last, however, she fell right wind’s eye, taken dead aback, stood awhile helpless, her sails shivering. “Clumsy fellows,” said I; “they must still drunk owls.” And I thought Captain Smollett would set skipping. Meanwhile schooner gradually fell filled upon another tack, sailed swiftly minute so, brought dead wind’s eye. Again repeated. To fro, down, north, south, east, west, HISPANIOLA sailed swoops dashes, repetition ended she begun, idly flapping canvas. It became plain nobody steering. And so, men? Either dead drunk deserted her, I thought, perhaps I could get board I might return vessel her captain. The current bearing coracle schooner southward equal rate. As latter’s sailing, wild intermittent, she hung time long irons, she certainly gained nothing, she even lose. If I dared sit paddle, I made sure I could overhaul her. The scheme air adventure inspired me, thought water breaker beside fore companion doubled growing courage. Up I got, welcomed almost instantly another cloud spray, time stuck purpose set myself, strength caution, paddle unsteered HISPANIOLA. Once I shipped sea heavy I stop bail, heart fluttering like bird, gradually I got way thing guided coracle among waves, blow upon her bows dash foam face. I gaining rapidly schooner; I could see brass glisten tiller banged about, still soul appeared upon her decks. I could choose suppose she deserted. If not, men lying drunk below, I might batten down, perhaps, I chose ship. For time she worse thing possible me--standing still. She headed nearly due south, yawing, course, time. Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, brought her moment right wind again. I said worst thing possible me, helpless she looked situation, canvas cracking like cannon blocks trundling banging deck, she still continued run away me, speed current, whole amount her leeway, naturally great. But now, last, I chance. The breeze fell seconds, low, current gradually turning her, HISPANIOLA revolved slowly round her centre last presented her stern, cabin window still gaping open lamp table still burning day. The main-sail hung drooped like banner. She stock-still current. For last little I even lost, redoubling efforts, I began overhaul chase. I hundred yards her wind came clap; she filled port tack again, stooping skimming like swallow. My first impulse one despair, second towards joy. Round she came, till she broadside me--round still till she covered half two thirds three quarters distance separated us. I could see waves boiling white her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked low station coracle. And then, sudden, I began comprehend. I scarce time think--scarce time act save myself. I summit one swell schooner came stooping next. The bowsprit head. I sprang feet leaped, stamping coracle water. With one hand I caught jib-boom, foot lodged stay brace; I still clung panting, dull blow told schooner charged upon struck coracle I left without retreat HISPANIOLA. 25 I Strike Jolly Roger I HAD scarce gained position bowsprit flying jib flapped filled upon tack, report like gun. The schooner trembled her keel reverse, next moment, sails still drawing, jib flapped back hung idle. This nearly tossed sea; I lost time, crawled back along bowsprit, tumbled head foremost deck. I lee side forecastle, mainsail, still drawing, concealed certain portion after-deck. Not soul seen. The planks, swabbed since mutiny, bore print many feet, empty bottle, broken neck, tumbled fro like live thing scuppers. Suddenly HISPANIOLA came right wind. The jibs behind cracked aloud, rudder slammed to, whole ship gave sickening heave shudder, moment main-boom swung inboard, sheet groaning blocks, showed lee after-deck. There two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap his back, stiff handspike, his arms stretched like crucifix his teeth showing his open lips; Israel Hands propped bulwarks, his chin his chest, his hands lying open deck, his face white, tan, tallow candle. For ship kept bucking sidling like vicious horse, sails filling, one tack, another, boom swinging fro till mast groaned aloud strain. Now would come cloud light sprays bulwark heavy blow ship’s bows swell; much heavier weather made great rigged ship home-made, lop-sided coracle, gone bottom sea. At every jump schooner, red-cap slipped fro, but--what ghastly behold--neither his attitude his fixed teeth-disclosing grin anyway disturbed rough usage. At every jump too, Hands appeared still sink settle upon deck, his feet sliding ever farther out, whole body canting towards stern, his face became, little little, hid me; last I could see nothing beyond his ear frayed ringlet one whisker. At time, I observed, around them, splashes dark blood upon planks began feel sure killed drunken wrath. While I thus looking wondering, calm moment, ship still, Israel Hands turned partly round low moan writhed back position I seen first. The moan, told pain deadly weakness, way his jaw hung open went right heart. But I remembered talk I overheard apple barrel, pity left me. I walked aft I reached main-mast. “Come aboard, Mr. Hands,” I said ironically. He rolled his eyes round heavily, he far gone express surprise. All he could utter one word, “Brandy.” It occurred time lose, dodging boom lurched across deck, I slipped aft companion stairs cabin. It scene confusion hardly fancy. All lockfast places broken open quest chart. The floor thick mud ruffians sat drink consult wading marshes round camp. The bulkheads, painted clear white beaded round gilt, bore pattern dirty hands. Dozens empty bottles clinked together corners rolling ship. One doctor’s medical books lay open table, half leaves gutted out, I suppose, pipelights. In midst lamp still cast smoky glow, obscure brown umber. I went cellar; barrels gone, bottles surprising number drunk thrown away. Certainly, since mutiny began, man could ever sober. Foraging about, I found bottle brandy left, Hands; I routed biscuit, pickled fruits, great bunch raisins, piece cheese. With I came deck, put stock behind rudder head well coxswain’s reach, went forward water-breaker, good deep drink water, then, till then, gave Hands brandy. He must drunk gill he took bottle his mouth. “Aye,” said he, “by thunder, I wanted that!” I sat already corner begun eat. “Much hurt?” I asked him. He grunted, rather, I might say, he barked. “If doctor aboard,” he said, “I would right enough couple turns, I do not manner luck, see, that is what is matter me. As swab, he is good dead, he is,” he added, indicating man red cap. “He warn’t seaman anyhow. And mought come from?” “Well,” said I, “I have come aboard take possession ship, Mr. Hands; you will please regard captain notice.” He looked sourly enough said nothing. Some colour come back his cheeks, though he still looked sick still continued slip settle ship banged about. “By by,” I continued, “I cannot colours, Mr. Hands; leave, I will strike  them. Better none these.” And dodging boom, I ran colour lines, handed cursed black flag, chucked overboard. “God save king!” said I, waving cap. “And there is end Captain Silver!” He watched keenly slyly, his chin his breast. “I reckon,” he said last, “I reckon, Cap’n Hawkins, you will kind want get ashore now. S’pose talks.” “Why, yes,” says I, “with heart, Mr. Hands. Say on.” And I went back meal good appetite. “This man,” he began, nodding feebly corpse “--O’Brien his name, rank Irelander--this man got canvas her, meaning sail her back. Well, HE IS dead now, he is--as dead bilge; who is sail ship, I do not see. Without I gives hint, are not man, far’s I tell. Now, look here, gives food drink old scarf ankecher tie wound up, do, I will tell sail her, that is square round, I take it.” “I will tell one thing,” says I: “I am going back Captain Kidd’s anchorage. I mean get North Inlet beach her quietly there.” “To sure did,” he cried. “Why, I are not sich infernal lubber all. I see, cannot I? I have tried fling, I have, I have lost, it is wind me. North Inlet? Why, I have not ch’ice, I! I would help sail her Execution Dock, thunder! So I would.” Well, seemed me, sense this. We struck bargain spot. In three minutes I HISPANIOLA sailing easily wind along coast Treasure Island, good hopes turning northern point ere noon beating far North Inlet high water, might beach her safely wait till subsiding tide permitted us land. Then I lashed tiller went chest, I got soft silk handkerchief mother’s. With this, aid, Hands bound great bleeding stab he received thigh, he eaten little swallow two brandy, he began pick visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder clearer, looked every way another man. The breeze served us admirably. We skimmed like bird, coast island flashing view changing every minute. Soon past high lands bowling beside low, sandy country, sparsely dotted dwarf pines, soon beyond turned corner rocky hill ends island north. I greatly elated new command, pleased bright, sunshiny weather different prospects coast. I plenty water good things eat, conscience, smitten hard desertion, quieted great conquest I made. I should, I think, nothing left desire eyes coxswain followed derisively deck odd smile appeared continually his face. It smile something pain weakness--a haggard old man’s smile; was, besides that, grain derision, shadow treachery, his expression he craftily watched, watched, watched work. 26 Israel Hands THE wind, serving us desire, hauled west. We could run much easier north-east corner island mouth North Inlet. Only, power anchor dared beach her till tide flowed good deal farther, time hung hands. The coxswain told lay ship to; good many trials I succeeded, sat silence another meal. “Cap’n,” said he length uncomfortable smile, “here is old shipmate, O’Brien; s’pose heave overboard. I are not partic’lar rule, I do not take blame settling his hash, I do not reckon ornamental now, you?” “I am strong enough, I do not like job; he lies, me,” said I. “This here is unlucky ship, HISPANIOLA, Jim,” he went on, blinking. “There is power men killed HISPANIOLA--a sight poor seamen dead gone since took ship Bristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, I. There O’Brien now--he is dead, are not he? Well now, I am scholar, you are lad read figure, put straight, take dead man dead good, he come alive again?” “You kill body, Mr. Hands, spirit; must know already,” I replied. “O’Brien another world, may watching us.” “Ah!” says he. “Well, that is unfort’nate--appears killing parties waste time. Howsomever, sperrits do not reckon much, I have seen. I will chance sperrits, Jim. And now, you have spoke free, I will take kind you would step cabin get a--well, a--shiver timbers! I cannot hit name ’t; well, get bottle wine, Jim--this brandy’s strong head.” Now, coxswain’s hesitation seemed unnatural, notion his preferring wine brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. The whole story pretext. He wanted leave deck--so much plain; purpose I could way imagine. His eyes never met mine; kept wandering fro, down, look sky, flitting glance upon dead O’Brien. All time he kept smiling putting his tongue guilty, embarrassed manner, child could told he bent deception. I prompt answer, however, I saw advantage lay fellow densely stupid I could easily conceal suspicions end. “Some wine?” I said. “Far better. Will white red?” “Well, I reckon it is blessed me, shipmate,” he replied; “so it is strong, plenty it, what is odds?” “All right,” I answered. “I will bring port, Mr. Hands. But I will dig it.” With I scuttled companion noise I could, slipped shoes, ran quietly along sparred gallery, mounted forecastle ladder, popped head fore companion. I knew he would expect see there, yet I took every precaution possible, certainly worst suspicions proved true. He risen his position his hands knees, though his leg obviously hurt pretty sharply he moved--for I could hear stifle groan--yet good, rattling rate he trailed across deck. In half minute he reached port scuppers picked, coil rope, long knife, rather short dirk, discoloured hilt blood. He looked upon moment, thrusting forth his jaw, tried point upon his hand, then, hastily concealing bosom his jacket, trundled back his old place bulwark. This I required know. Israel could move about, he armed, he much trouble get rid me, plain I meant victim. What he would afterwards--whether he would try crawl right across island North Inlet camp among swamps whether he would fire Long Tom, trusting his comrades might come first help him--was, course, I could say. Yet I felt sure I could trust one point, since interests jumped together, disposition schooner. We desired her stranded safe enough, sheltered place, that, time came, she could got little labour danger might be; done I considered life would certainly spared. While I thus turning business mind, I idle body. I stolen back cabin, slipped shoes, laid hand random bottle wine, now, excuse, I made reappearance deck. Hands lay I left him, fallen together bundle his eyelids lowered though he weak bear light. He looked up, however, coming, knocked neck bottle like man done thing often, took good swig, his favourite toast “Here is luck!” Then he lay quiet little, then, pulling stick tobacco, begged cut quid. “Cut junk that,” says he, “for I have not knife hardly strength enough, I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I have missed stays! Cut quid, as’ll likely last, lad, I am long home, mistake.” “Well,” said I, “I will cut tobacco, I thought badly, I would go prayers like Christian man.” “Why?” said he. “Now, tell why.” “Why?” I cried. “You asking dead. You have broken trust; you have lived sin lies blood; there is man killed lying feet moment, ask why! For God’s mercy, Mr. Hands, that is why.” I spoke little heat, thinking bloody dirk he hidden his pocket designed, his ill thoughts, end with. He, his part, took great draught wine spoke unusual solemnity. “For thirty years,” he said, “I have sailed seas seen good bad, better worse, fair weather foul, provisions running out, knives going, not. Well, I tell you, I never seen good come goodness yet. Him strikes first fancy; dead men do not bite; them’s views--amen, it. And now, look here,” he added, suddenly changing his tone, “we have enough foolery. The tide’s made good enough now. You take orders, Cap’n Hawkins, we will sail slap done it.” All told, scarce two miles run; navigation delicate, entrance northern anchorage narrow shoal, lay east west, schooner must nicely handled got in. I think I good, prompt subaltern, I sure Hands excellent pilot, went dodged in, shaving banks, certainty neatness pleasure behold. Scarcely passed heads land closed around us. The shores North Inlet thickly wooded southern anchorage, space longer narrower like, truth was, estuary river. Right us, southern end, saw wreck ship last stages dilapidation. It great vessel three masts lain long exposed injuries weather hung great webs dripping seaweed, deck shore bushes taken root flourished thick flowers. It sad sight, showed us anchorage calm. “Now,” said Hands, “look there; there is pet bit beach ship in. Fine flat sand, never cat’s paw, trees around it, flowers a-blowing like garding old ship.” “And beached,” I inquired, “how shall get her again?” “Why, so,” he replied: “you take line ashore side low water, take turn one big pines; bring back, take turn around capstan, lie tide. Come high water, hands take pull upon line, she comes sweet natur’. And now, boy, stand by. We are near bit now, she is much way her. Starboard little--so--steady--starboard--larboard little--steady--steady!” So he issued his commands, I breathlessly obeyed, till, sudden, he cried, “Now, hearty, luff!” And I put helm hard up, HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly ran stem low, wooded shore. The excitement last manoeuvres somewhat interfered watch I kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon coxswain. Even I still much interested, waiting ship touch, I quite forgot peril hung head stood craning starboard bulwarks watching ripples spreading wide bows. I might fallen without struggle life sudden disquietude seized upon made turn head. Perhaps I heard creak seen his shadow moving tail eye; perhaps instinct like cat’s; but, sure enough, I looked round, Hands, already half-way towards me, dirk his right hand. We must cried aloud eyes met, mine shrill cry terror, his roar fury like charging bully’s. At instant, he threw forward I leapt sideways towards bows. As I so, I let go tiller, sprang sharp leeward, I think saved life, struck Hands across chest stopped him, moment, dead. Before he could recover, I safe corner he trapped, deck dodge about. Just forward main-mast I stopped, drew pistol pocket, took cool aim, though he already turned coming directly me, drew trigger. The hammer fell, followed neither flash sound; priming useless sea-water. I cursed neglect. Why I, long before, reprimed reloaded weapons? Then I now, mere fleeing sheep butcher. Wounded he was, wonderful fast he could move, his grizzled hair tumbling his face, his face red red ensign his haste fury. I time try pistol, indeed much inclination, I sure would useless. One thing I saw plainly: I must simply retreat him, he would speedily hold boxed bows, moment since he nearly boxed stern. Once caught, nine ten inches blood-stained dirk would last experience side eternity. I placed palms main-mast, goodish bigness, waited, every nerve upon stretch. Seeing I meant dodge, he also paused; moment two passed feints his part corresponding movements upon mine. It game I often played home rocks Black Hill Cove, never before, may sure, wildly beating heart now. Still, I say, boy’s game, I thought I could hold elderly seaman wounded thigh. Indeed courage begun rise high I allowed darting thoughts would end affair, I saw certainly I could spin long, I saw hope ultimate escape. Well, things stood thus, suddenly HISPANIOLA struck, staggered, ground instant sand, then, swift blow, canted port side till deck stood angle forty-five degrees puncheon water splashed scupper holes lay, pool, deck bulwark. We us capsized second, us rolled, almost together, scuppers, dead red-cap, his arms still spread out, tumbling stiffly us. So near we, indeed, head came coxswain’s foot crack made teeth rattle. Blow all, I first afoot again, Hands got involved dead body. The sudden canting ship made deck place running on; I find new way escape, upon instant, foe almost touching me. Quick thought, I sprang mizzen shrouds, rattled hand hand, draw breath till I seated cross-trees. I saved prompt; dirk struck half foot I pursued upward flight; stood Israel Hands his mouth open his face upturned mine, perfect statue surprise disappointment. Now I moment myself, I lost time changing priming pistol, then, one ready service, make assurance doubly sure, I proceeded draw load recharge afresh beginning. My new employment struck Hands heap; he began see dice going him, obvious hesitation, he also hauled heavily shrouds, dirk his teeth, began slowly painfully mount. It cost end time groans haul his wounded leg behind him, I quietly finished arrangements he much third way up. Then, pistol either hand, I addressed him. “One step, Mr. Hands,” said I, “and I will blow brains out! Dead men do not bite, know,” I added chuckle. He stopped instantly. I could see working his face he trying think, process slow laborious that, new-found security, I laughed aloud. At last, swallow two, he spoke, his face still wearing expression extreme perplexity. In order speak he take dagger his mouth, else he remained unmoved. “Jim,” says he, “I reckon we are fouled, me, we will sign articles. I would lurch, I do not luck, I; I reckon I will strike, comes hard, see, master mariner ship’s younker like you, Jim.” I drinking his words smiling away, conceited cock upon wall, when, breath, back went his right hand his shoulder. Something sang like arrow air; I felt blow sharp pang, I pinned shoulder mast. In horrid pain surprise moment--I scarce say volition, I sure without conscious aim--both pistols went off, escaped hands. They fall alone; choked cry, coxswain loosed his grasp upon shrouds plunged head first water. 27 “Pieces Eight” OWING cannot vessel, masts hung far water, perch cross-trees I nothing surface bay. Hands, far up, consequence nearer ship fell bulwarks. He rose surface lather foam blood sank good. As water settled, I could see lying huddled together clean, bright sand shadow vessel’s sides. A fish two whipped past his body. Sometimes, quivering water, he appeared move little, he trying rise. But he dead enough, that, shot drowned, food fish place he designed slaughter. I sooner certain I began feel sick, faint, terrified. The hot blood running back chest. The dirk, pinned shoulder mast, seemed burn like hot iron; yet much real sufferings distressed me, these, seemed me, I could bear without murmur; horror I upon mind falling cross-trees still green water, beside body coxswain. I clung hands till nails ached, I shut eyes cover peril. Gradually mind came back again, pulses quieted natural time, I possession myself. It first thought pluck forth dirk, either stuck hard nerve failed me, I desisted violent shudder. Oddly enough, shudder business. The knife, fact, come nearest world missing altogether; held mere pinch skin, shudder tore away. The blood ran faster, sure, I master tacked mast coat shirt. These last I broke sudden jerk, regained deck starboard shrouds. For nothing world would I ventured, shaken I was, upon overhanging port shrouds Israel lately fallen. I went I could wound; pained good deal still bled freely, neither deep dangerous, greatly gall I used arm. Then I looked around me, ship now, sense, own, I began think clearing last passenger--the dead man, O’Brien. He pitched, I said, bulwarks, he lay like horrible, ungainly sort puppet, life-size, indeed, different life’s colour life’s comeliness! In position I could easily way him, habit tragical adventures worn almost terror dead, I took waist he sack bran one good heave, tumbled overboard. He went sounding plunge; red cap came remained floating surface; soon splash subsided, I could see Israel lying side side, wavering tremulous movement water. O’Brien, though still quite young man, bald. There he lay, bald head across knees man killed quick fishes steering fro both. I alone upon ship; tide turned. The sun within degrees setting already shadow pines upon western shore began reach right across anchorage fall patterns deck. The evening breeze sprung up, though well warded hill two peaks upon east, cordage begun sing little softly idle sails rattle fro. I began see danger ship. The jibs I speedily doused brought tumbling deck, main-sail harder matter. Of course, schooner canted over, boom swung out-board, cap foot two sail hung even water. I thought made still dangerous; yet strain heavy I half feared meddle. At last I got knife cut halyards. The peak dropped instantly, great belly loose canvas floated broad upon water, since, pull I liked, I could budge downhall, extent I could accomplish. For rest, HISPANIOLA must trust luck, like myself. By time whole anchorage fallen shadow--the last rays, I remember, falling glade wood shining bright jewels flowery mantle wreck. It began chill; tide rapidly fleeting seaward, schooner settling her beam-ends. I scrambled forward looked over. It seemed shallow enough, holding cut hawser hands last security, I let drop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached waist; sand firm covered ripple marks, I waded ashore great spirits, leaving HISPANIOLA her side, her main-sail trailing wide upon surface bay. About time, sun went fairly breeze whistled low dusk among tossing pines. At least, last, I sea, I returned thence empty-handed. There lay schooner, clear last buccaneers ready men board get sea again. I nothing nearer fancy get home stockade boast achievements. Possibly I might blamed bit truantry, recapture HISPANIOLA clenching answer, I hoped even Captain Smollett would confess I lost time. So thinking, famous spirits, I began set face homeward block house companions. I remembered easterly rivers drain Captain Kidd’s anchorage ran two-peaked hill upon left, I bent course direction I might pass stream small. The wood pretty open, keeping along lower spurs, I soon turned corner hill, long waded mid-calf across watercourse. This brought near I encountered Ben Gunn, maroon; I walked circumspectly, keeping eye every side. The dusk come nigh hand completely, I opened cleft two peaks, I became aware wavering glow sky, where, I judged, man island cooking his supper roaring fire. And yet I wondered, heart, he show careless. For I could see radiance, might reach eyes Silver he camped upon shore among marshes? Gradually night fell blacker; I could guide even roughly towards destination; double hill behind Spy-glass right hand loomed faint fainter; stars pale; low ground I wandered I kept tripping among bushes rolling sandy pits. Suddenly kind brightness fell me. I looked up; pale glimmer moonbeams alighted summit Spy-glass, soon I saw something broad silvery moving low behind trees, knew moon risen. With help me, I passed rapidly remained journey, sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew near stockade. Yet, I began thread grove lies it, I thoughtless I slacked pace went trifle warily. It would poor end adventures get shot party mistake. The moon climbing higher higher, light began fall masses open districts wood, right front glow different colour appeared among trees. It red hot, little darkened--as were, embers bonfire smouldering. For life I could think might be. At last I came right upon borders clearing. The western end already steeped moonshine; rest, block house itself, still lay black shadow chequered long silvery streaks light. On side house immense fire burned clear embers she would steady, red reverberation, contrasted strongly mellow paleness moon. There soul stirring sound beside noises breeze. I stopped, much wonder heart, perhaps little terror also. It way build great fires; were, indeed, captain’s orders, somewhat niggardly firewood, I began fear something gone wrong I absent. I stole round eastern end, keeping close shadow, convenient place, darkness thickest, crossed palisade. To make assurance surer, I got upon hands knees crawled, without sound, towards corner house. As I drew nearer, heart suddenly greatly lightened. It pleasant noise itself, I often complained times, like music hear friends snoring together loud peaceful sleep. The sea-cry watch, beautiful “All’s well,” never fell reassuringly ear. In meantime, doubt one thing; kept infamous bad watch. If Silver his lads creeping them, soul would seen daybreak. That was, thought I, captain wounded; I blamed sharply leaving danger mount guard. By time I got door stood up. All dark within, I could distinguish nothing eye. As sounds, steady drone snorers small occasional noise, flickering pecking I could way account for. With arms I walked steadily in. I lie place (I thought silent chuckle) enjoy faces found morning. My foot struck something yielding--it sleeper’s leg; he turned groaned, without awaking. And then, sudden, shrill voice broke forth darkness: “Pieces eight! Pieces eight! Pieces eight! Pieces eight! Pieces eight!” forth, without pause change, like clacking tiny mill. Silver’s green parrot, Captain Flint! It she I heard pecking piece bark; she, keeping better watch human being, thus announced arrival her wearisome refrain. I time left recover. At sharp, clipping tone parrot, sleepers awoke sprang up; mighty oath, voice Silver cried, “Who goes?” I turned run, struck violently one person, recoiled, ran full arms second, his part closed upon held tight. “Bring torch, Dick,” said Silver capture thus assured. And one men left log-house presently returned lighted brand. PART SIX--Captain Silver 28 In Enemy’s Camp THE red glare torch, lighting interior block house, showed worst apprehensions realized. The pirates possession house stores: cask cognac, pork bread, before, tenfold increased horror, sign prisoner. I could judge perished, heart smote sorely I perish them. There six buccaneers, told; another man left alive. Five feet, flushed swollen, suddenly called first sleep drunkenness. The sixth risen upon his elbow; he deadly pale, blood-stained bandage round his head told he recently wounded, still recently dressed. I remembered man shot run back among woods great attack, doubted he. The parrot sat, preening her plumage, Long John’s shoulder. He himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler stern I used to. He still wore fine broadcloth suit he fulfilled his mission, bitterly worse wear, daubed clay torn sharp briers wood. “So,” said he, “here is Jim Hawkins, shiver timbers! Dropped in, like, eh? Well, come, I take friendly.” And thereupon he sat across brandy cask began fill pipe. “Give loan link, Dick,” said he; then, he good light, “That will do, lad,” he added; “stick glim wood heap; you, gentlemen, bring to! You need not stand Mr. Hawkins; HE WILL excuse you, may lay that. And so, Jim”--stopping tobacco--“here were, quite pleasant surprise poor old John. I see smart first I set eyes you, gets away clean, do.” To this, may well supposed, I made answer. They set back wall, I stood there, looking Silver face, pluckily enough, I hope, outward appearance, black despair heart. Silver took whiff two his pipe great composure ran again. “Now, see, Jim, ARE here,” says he, “I will give piece mind. I have always liked you, I have, lad spirit, picter self I young handsome. I always wanted jine take share, die gentleman, now, cock, you have got to. Cap’n Smollett’s fine seaman, I will day, stiff discipline. ‘Dooty dooty,’ says he, right he is. Just keep clear cap’n. The doctor gone dead you--‘ungrateful scamp’ he said; short long whole story here: cannot go back lot, will not you; without start third ship’s company yourself, might lonely, you will jine Cap’n Silver.” So far good. My friends, then, still alive, though I partly believed truth Silver’s statement, cabin party incensed desertion, I relieved distressed I heard. “I do not say nothing hands,” continued Silver, “though are, may lay it. I am argyment; I never seen good come threatening. If like service, well, you will jine; do not, Jim, why, you are free answer no--free welcome, shipmate; fairer said mortal seaman, shiver sides!” “Am I answer, then?” I asked tremulous voice. Through sneering talk, I made feel threat death overhung me, cheeks burned heart beat painfully breast. “Lad,” said Silver, “no one’s a-pressing you. Take bearings. None us will not hurry you, mate; time goes pleasant company, see.” “Well,” says I, growing bit bolder, “if I am choose, I declare I right know what is what, you are here, friends are.” “Wot’s wot?” repeated one buccaneers deep growl. “Ah, he would lucky one knowed that!” “You will perhaps batten hatches till you are spoke to, friend,” cried Silver truculently speaker. And then, his first gracious tones, he replied me, “Yesterday morning, Mr. Hawkins,” said he, “in dog-watch, came Doctor Livesey flag truce. Says he, ‘Cap’n Silver, you are sold out. Ship’s gone.’ Well, maybe we would taking glass, song help round. I will not say no. Leastways, none us looked out. We looked out, thunder, old ship gone! I never seen pack fools look fishier; may lay that, I tells looked fishiest. ‘Well,’ says doctor, ‘let us bargain.’ We bargained, I, are: stores, brandy, block house, firewood thoughtful enough cut, manner speaking, whole blessed boat, cross-trees kelson. As them, they have tramped; I do not know where is are.” He drew quietly his pipe. “And lest take head yours,” he went on, “that included treaty, here is last word said: ‘How many you,’ says I, ‘to leave?’ ‘Four,’ says he; ‘four, one us wounded. As boy, I do not know he is, confound him,’ says he, ‘nor I do not much care. We are sick him.’ These his words. “Is all?” I asked. “Well, it is you are hear, son,” returned Silver. “And I choose?” “And choose, may lay that,” said Silver. “Well,” said I, “I fool I know pretty well I look for. Let worst come worst, it is little I care. I have seen many die since I fell you. But there is thing two I tell you,” I said, time I quite excited; “and first this: are, bad way--ship lost, treasure lost, men lost, whole business gone wreck; want know it--it I! I apple barrel night sighted land, I heard you, John, you, Dick Johnson, Hands, bottom sea, told every word said hour out. And schooner, I cut her cable, I killed men aboard her, I brought her you will never see her more, one you. The laugh’s side; I have top business first; I fear I fear fly. Kill me, please, spare me. But one thing I will say, more; spare me, bygones bygones, fellows court piracy, I will save I can. It choose. Kill another good, spare keep witness save gallows.” I stopped, for, I tell you, I breath, wonder, man moved, sat staring like many sheep. And still staring, I broke again, “And now, Mr. Silver,” I said, “I believe you are best man here, things go worst, I will take kind let doctor know way I took it.” “I will bear mind,” said Silver accent curious I could not, life me, decide whether he laughing request favourably affected courage. “I will put one that,” cried old mahogany-faced seaman--Morgan name--whom I seen Long John’s public-house upon quays Bristol. “It knowed Black Dog.” “Well, see here,” added sea-cook. “I will put another that, thunder! For boy faked chart Billy Bones. First last, we have split upon Jim Hawkins!” “Then goes!” said Morgan oath. And he sprang up, drawing his knife he twenty. “Avast, there!” cried Silver. “Who you, Tom Morgan? Maybe thought cap’n here, perhaps. By powers, I will teach better! Cross me, you will go many good man’s gone you, first last, thirty year back--some yard-arm, shiver timbers, board, feed fishes. There is never man looked eyes seen good day a’terwards, Tom Morgan, may lay that.” Morgan paused, hoarse murmur rose others. “Tom’s right,” said one. “I stood hazing long enough one,” added another. “I will hanged I will hazed you, John Silver.” “Did gentlemen want ME?” roared Silver, bending far forward his position keg, his pipe still glowing his right hand. “Put name you are at; are not dumb, I reckon. Him wants shall get it. Have I lived many years, son rum puncheon cock his hat athwart hawse latter end it? You know way; you are gentlemen fortune, account. Well, I am ready. Take cutlass, dares, I will see colour his inside, crutch all, pipe’s empty.” Not man stirred; man answered. “That is sort, it?” he added, returning his pipe his mouth. “Well, you are gay lot look at, anyway. Not much worth fight, are not. P’r’aps understand King George’s English. I am cap’n ’lection. I am cap’n I am best man long sea-mile. You will not fight, gentlemen fortune should; then, thunder, you will obey, may lay it! I like boy, now; I never seen better boy that. He is man pair rats house, I say this: let see that will lay hand him--that is I say, may lay it.” There long pause this. I stood straight wall, heart still going like sledge-hammer, ray hope shining bosom. Silver leant back wall, his arms crossed, his pipe corner his mouth, calm though he church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, he kept tail his unruly followers. They, part, drew gradually together towards far end block house, low hiss whispering sounded ear continuously, like stream. One another, would look up, red light torch would fall second nervous faces; towards me, towards Silver turned eyes. “You seem lot say,” remarked Silver, spitting far air. “Pipe let hear it, lay to.” “Ax pardon, sir,” returned one men; “you are pretty free rules; maybe you will kindly keep eye upon rest. This crew’s dissatisfied; crew do not vally bullying marlin-spike; crew rights like crews, I will make free that; rules, I take talk together. I ax pardon, sir, acknowledging captaing present; I claim right, steps outside council.” And elaborate sea-salute, fellow, long, ill-looking, yellow-eyed man five thirty, stepped coolly towards door disappeared house. One another rest followed his example, making salute he passed, adding apology. “According rules,” said one. “Forecastle council,” said Morgan. And one remark another marched left Silver alone torch. The sea-cook instantly removed his pipe. “Now, look here, Jim Hawkins,” he said steady whisper audible, “you are within half plank death, what is long sight worse, torture. They are going throw off. But, mark, I stand thick thin. I did not mean to; no, till spoke up. I desperate lose much blunt, hanged bargain. But I see right sort. I says myself, stand Hawkins, John, Hawkins’ll stand you. You are his last card, living thunder, John, he is yours! Back back, says I. You save witness, he will save neck!” I began dimly understand. “You mean all’s lost?” I asked. “Aye, gum, I do!” he answered. “Ship gone, neck gone--that is size it. Once I looked bay, Jim Hawkins, seen schooner--well, I am tough, I gave out. As lot council, mark me, they are outright fools cowards. I will save life--if I can--from them. But, see here, Jim--tit tat--you save Long John swinging.” I bewildered; seemed thing hopeless he asking--he, old buccaneer, ringleader throughout. “What I do, I will do,” I said. “It is bargain!” cried Long John. “You speak plucky, thunder, I have chance!” He hobbled torch, stood propped among firewood, took fresh light his pipe. “Understand me, Jim,” he said, returning. “I have head shoulders, I have. I am squire’s side now. I know you have got ship safe somewheres. How done it, I do not know, safe is. I guess Hands O’Brien turned soft. I never much believed neither THEM. Now mark me. I ask questions, I will not let others. I know game’s up, I do; I know lad that is staunch. Ah, that is young--you might done power good together!” He drew cognac cask tin cannikin. “Will taste, messmate?” he asked; I refused: “Well, I will take dram myself, Jim,” said he. “I need caulker, there is trouble hand. And talking trouble, doctor give chart, Jim?” My face expressed wonder unaffected he saw needlessness questions. “Ah, well, he did, though,” said he. “And there is something that, doubt--something, surely, that, Jim--bad good.” And he took another swallow brandy, shaking his great fair head like man looks forward worst. 29 The Black Spot Again THE council buccaneers lasted time, one re-entered house, repetition salute, eyes ironical air, begged moment’s loan torch. Silver briefly agreed, emissary retired again, leaving us together dark. “There is breeze coming, Jim,” said Silver, time adopted quite friendly familiar tone. I turned loophole nearest looked out. The embers great fire far burned glowed low duskily I understood conspirators desired torch. About half-way slope stockade, collected group; one held light, another his knees midst, I saw blade open knife shine his hand varying colours moon torchlight. The rest somewhat stooping, though watching manoeuvres last. I could make he book well knife his hand, still wondering anything incongruous come possession kneeling figure rose his feet whole party began move together towards house. “Here come,” said I; I returned former position, seemed beneath dignity find watching them. “Well, let  them come, lad--let  them come,” said Silver cheerily. “I have still shot locker.” The door opened, five men, standing huddled together inside, pushed one number forward. In circumstances would comical see his slow advance, hesitating he set foot, holding his closed right hand front him. “Step up, lad,” cried Silver. “I will not eat you. Hand over, lubber. I know rules, I do; I will not hurt depytation.” Thus encouraged, buccaneer stepped forth briskly, passed something Silver, hand hand, slipped yet smartly back his companions. The sea-cook looked given him. “The black spot! I thought so,” he observed. “Where might got paper? Why, hillo! Look here, now; are not lucky! You have gone cut Bible. What fool’s cut Bible?” “Ah, there!” said Morgan. “There! Wot I say? No good’ll come that, I said.” “Well, you have fixed now, among you,” continued Silver. “You will swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber Bible?” “It Dick,” said one. “Dick, it? Then Dick get prayers,” said Silver. “He is seen his slice luck, Dick, may lay that.” But long man yellow eyes struck in. “Belay talk, John Silver,” he said. “This crew tipped black spot full council, dooty bound; turn over, dooty bound, see what is wrote there. Then talk.” “Thanky, George,” replied sea-cook. “You always brisk business, rules heart, George, I am pleased see. Well, it, anyway? Ah! ‘Deposed’--that is it, it? Very pretty wrote, sure; like print, I swear. Your hand write, George? Why, gettin’ quite leadin’ man crew. You will cap’n next, I should not wonder. Just oblige torch again, you? This pipe do not draw.” “Come, now,” said George, “you do not fool crew more. You are funny man, account; you are now, you will maybe step barrel help vote.” “I thought said knowed rules,” returned Silver contemptuously. “Leastways, do not, I do; I wait here--and I am still cap’n, mind--till outs grievances I reply; meantime, black spot are not worth biscuit. After that, we will see.” “Oh,” replied George, “you do not kind apprehension; WE ARE square, are. First, you have made hash cruise--you will bold man say that. Second, let enemy trap nothing. Why want out? I do not know, it is pretty plain wanted it. Third, would not let us go upon march. Oh, see you, John Silver; want play booty, that is what is wrong you. And then, fourth, there is boy.” “Is all?” asked Silver quietly. “Enough, too,” retorted George. “We will swing sun-dry bungling.” “Well now, look here, I will answer four p’ints; one another I will answer  them. I made hash cruise, I? Well now, know I wanted, know done we would ’a aboard HISPANIOLA night ever was, every man us alive, fit, full good plum-duff, treasure hold her, thunder! Well, crossed me? Who forced hand, lawful cap’n? Who tipped black spot day landed began dance? Ah, it is fine dance--I am there--and looks mighty like hornpipe rope’s end Execution Dock London town, does. But done it? Why, Anderson, Hands, you, George Merry! And you are last board meddling crew; Davy Jones’s insolence stand cap’n me--you, sank lot us! By powers! But tops stiffest yarn nothing.” Silver paused, I could see faces George his late comrades words said vain. “That is number one,” cried accused, wiping sweat his brow, he talking vehemence shook house. “Why, I give word, I am sick speak you. You have neither sense memory, I leave fancy mothers let come sea. Sea! Gentlemen fortune! I reckon tailors trade.” “Go on, John,” said Morgan. “Speak others.” “Ah, others!” returned John. “They are nice lot, are not they? You say cruise bungled. Ah! By gum, could understand bad it is bungled, would see! We are near gibbet neck’s stiff thinking it. You have seen  them, maybe, hanged chains, birds  them, seamen p’inting  them go tide. ‘Who is that?’ says one. ‘That! Why, that is John Silver. I knowed well,’ says another. And hear chains a-jangle go reach buoy. Now, that is are, every mother’s son us, thanks him, Hands, Anderson, ruination fools you. And want know number four, boy, why, shiver timbers, is not he hostage? Are a-going waste hostage? No, us; he might last chance, I should not wonder. Kill boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah, well, there is deal say number three. Maybe do not count nothing real college doctor see every day--you, John, head broke--or you, George Merry, ague shakes upon six hours agone, eyes colour lemon peel moment clock? And maybe, perhaps, did not know consort coming either? But is, long till then; we will see who will glad hostage comes that. And number two, I made bargain--well, came crawling knees make it--on knees came, downhearted--and you would starved I had not--but that is trifle! You look there--that is why!” And he cast upon floor paper I instantly recognized--none chart yellow paper, three red crosses, I found oilcloth bottom captain’s chest. Why doctor given I could fancy. But inexplicable me, appearance chart incredible surviving mutineers. They leaped upon like cats upon mouse. It went hand hand, one tearing another; oaths cries childish laughter accompanied examination, would thought, fingering gold, sea it, besides, safety. “Yes,” said one, “that is Flint, sure enough. J. F., score below, clove hitch it; he done ever.” “Mighty pretty,” said George. “But get away it, us ship.” Silver suddenly sprang up, supporting hand wall: “Now I give warning, George,” he cried. “One word sauce, I will call fight you. How? Why, I know? You ought tell that--you rest, lost schooner, interference, burn you! But you, cannot; hain’t got invention cockroach. But civil speak, shall, George Merry, may lay that.” “That is fair enow,” said old man Morgan. “Fair! I reckon so,” said sea-cook. “You lost ship; I found treasure. Who is better man that? And I resign, thunder! Elect please cap’n now; I am done it.” “Silver!” cried. “Barbecue forever! Barbecue cap’n!” “So that is toon, it?” cried cook. “George, I reckon you will wait another turn, friend; lucky I am revengeful man. But never way. And now, shipmates, black spot? ’Tain’t much good now, it? Dick’s crossed his luck spoiled his Bible, that is all.” “It will kiss book still, will not it?” growled Dick, evidently uneasy curse he brought upon himself. “A Bible bit cut out!” returned Silver derisively. “Not it. It do not bind more’n ballad-book.” “Do not it, though?” cried Dick sort joy. “Well, I reckon that is worth too.” “Here, Jim--here is cur’osity you,” said Silver, he tossed paper. It around size crown piece. One side blank, last leaf; contained verse two Revelation--these words among rest, struck sharply home upon mind: “Without dogs murderers.” The printed side blackened wood ash, already began come soil fingers; blank side written material one word “Depposed.” I curiosity beside moment, trace writing remains beyond single scratch, man might make his thumb-nail. That end night’s business. Soon after, drink round, lay sleep, outside Silver’s vengeance put George Merry sentinel threaten death he prove unfaithful. It long ere I could close eye, heaven knows I matter enough thought man I slain afternoon, perilous position, all, remarkable game I saw Silver engaged upon--keeping mutineers together one hand grasping every means, possible impossible, make his peace save his miserable life. He slept peacefully snored aloud, yet heart sore him, wicked he was, think dark perils environed shameful gibbet awaited him. 30 On Parole I WAS wakened--indeed, wakened, I could see even sentinel shake together he fallen door-post--by clear, hearty voice hailing us margin wood: “Block house, ahoy!” cried. “Here is doctor.” And doctor was. Although I glad hear sound, yet gladness without admixture. I remembered confusion insubordinate stealthy conduct, I saw brought me--among companions surrounded dangers--I felt ashamed look face. He must risen dark, day hardly come; I ran loophole looked out, I saw standing, like Silver before, mid-leg creeping vapour. “You, doctor! Top morning you, sir!” cried Silver, broad awake beaming good nature moment. “Bright early, sure; it is early bird, saying goes, gets rations. George, shake timbers, son, help Dr. Livesey ship’s side. All a-doing well, patients was--all well merry.” So he pattered on, standing hilltop his crutch his elbow one hand upon side log-house--quite old John voice, manner, expression. “We have quite surprise too, sir,” he continued. “We have little stranger here--he! he! A noo boarder lodger, sir, looking fit taut fiddle; slep’ like supercargo, he did, right alongside John--stem stem was, night.” Dr. Livesey time across stockade pretty near cook, I could hear alteration his voice he said, “Not Jim?” “The Jim ever was,” says Silver. The doctor stopped outright, although he speak, seconds he seemed able move on. “Well, well,” he said last, “duty first pleasure afterwards, might said yourself, Silver. Let us overhaul patients yours.” A moment afterwards he entered block house one grim nod proceeded his work among sick. He seemed apprehension, though he must known his life, among treacherous demons, depended hair; he rattled his patients he paying ordinary professional visit quiet English family. His manner, I suppose, reacted men, behaved nothing occurred, he still ship’s doctor still faithful hands mast. “You are well, friend,” he said fellow bandaged head, “and ever person close shave, you; head must hard iron. Well, George, goes it? You are pretty colour, certainly; why, liver, man, upside down. Did take medicine? Did he take medicine, men?” “Aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough,” returned Morgan. “Because, see, since I mutineers’ doctor, prison doctor I prefer call it,” says Doctor Livesey his pleasantest way, “I make point honour lose man King George (God bless him!) gallows.” The rogues looked swallowed home-thrust silence. “Dick do not feel well, sir,” said one. “Do not he?” replied doctor. “Well, step here, Dick, let see tongue. No, I surprised he did! The man’s tongue fit frighten French. Another fever.” “Ah, there,” said Morgan, “that comed sp’iling Bibles.” “That comes--as call it--of arrant asses,” retorted doctor, “and sense enough know honest air poison, dry land vile, pestiferous slough. I think probable--though course it is opinion--that you will deuce pay get malaria systems. Camp bog, would you? Silver, I am surprised you. You are less fool many, take round; do not appear rudiments notion rules health. “Well,” he added he dosed round taken his prescriptions, really laughable humility, like charity schoolchildren blood-guilty mutineers pirates--“well, that is done today. And I wish talk boy, please.” And he nodded his head direction carelessly. George Merry door, spitting spluttering bad-tasted medicine; first word doctor’s proposal he swung round deep flush cried “No!” swore. Silver struck barrel his open hand. “Si-lence!” he roared looked positively like lion. “Doctor,” he went his usual tones, “I a-thinking that, knowing fancy boy. We are humbly grateful kindness, see, puts faith takes drugs like much grog. And I take I have found way as’ll suit all. Hawkins, give word honour young gentleman--for young gentleman are, although poor born--your word honour slip cable?” I readily gave pledge required. “Then, doctor,” said Silver, “you step outside stockade, you are I will bring boy inside, I reckon yarn spars. Good day you, sir, dooties squire Cap’n Smollett.” The explosion disapproval, nothing Silver’s black looks restrained, broke immediately doctor left house. Silver roundly accused playing double--of trying make separate peace himself, sacrificing interests his accomplices victims, and, one word, identical, exact thing he doing. It seemed obvious, case, I could imagine he turn anger. But he twice man rest were, his last night’s victory given huge preponderance minds. He called fools dolts imagine, said necessary I talk doctor, fluttered chart faces, asked could afford break treaty day bound a-treasure-hunting. “No, thunder!” he cried. “It is us must break treaty time comes; till I will gammon doctor, I ile his boots brandy.” And he bade get fire lit, stalked upon his crutch, his hand shoulder, leaving disarray, silenced his volubility rather convinced. “Slow, lad, slow,” he said. “They might round upon us twinkle eye seen hurry.” Very deliberately, then, advance across sand doctor awaited us side stockade, soon within easy speaking distance Silver stopped. “You will make note also, doctor,” says he, “and boy’ll tell I saved his life, deposed too, may lay that. Doctor, man’s steering near wind me--playing chuck-farthing last breath his body, like--you would not think much, mayhap, give one good word? You will please bear mind it is life now--it is boy’s bargain; you will speak fair, doctor, give bit hope go on, sake mercy.” Silver changed man he his back his friends block house; his cheeks seemed fallen in, his voice trembled; never soul dead earnest. “Why, John, you are afraid?” asked Dr. Livesey. “Doctor, I am coward; no, I--not SO much!” he snapped his fingers. “If I I would not say it. But I will fairly, I have shakes upon gallows. You are good man true; I never seen better man! And you will forget I done good, you will forget bad, I know. And I step aside--see here--and leave Jim alone. And you will put too, it is long stretch, that!” So saying, he stepped back little way, till he earshot, sat upon tree-stump began whistle, spinning round upon his seat command sight, sometimes doctor sometimes his unruly ruffians went fro sand fire--which busy rekindling--and house, brought forth pork bread make breakfast. “So, Jim,” said doctor sadly, “here are. As brewed, shall drink, boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find heart blame you, much I say, kind unkind: Captain Smollett well, dared gone off; he ill could not help it, George, downright cowardly!” I I began weep. “Doctor,” I said, “you might spare me. I blamed enough; life’s forfeit anyway, I dead Silver had not stood me; doctor, believe this, I die--and I dare say I deserve it--but I fear torture. If come torture me--” “Jim,” doctor interrupted, his voice quite changed, “Jim, I cannot this. Whip over, we will run it.” “Doctor,” said I, “I passed word.” “I know, I know,” he cried. “We cannot help that, Jim, now. I will take shoulders, holus bolus, blame shame, boy; stay here, I cannot let you. Jump! One jump, you are out, we will run like antelopes.” “No,” I replied; “you know right well would not thing yourself--neither squire captain; I. Silver trusted me; I passed word, back I go. But, doctor, let finish. If come torture me, I might let slip word ship is, I got ship, part luck part risking, she lies North Inlet, southern beach, high water. At half tide she must high dry.” “The ship!” exclaimed doctor. Rapidly I described adventures, he heard silence. “There kind fate this,” he observed I done. “Every step, it is saves lives; suppose chance going let lose yours? That would poor return, boy. You found plot; found Ben Gunn--the best deed ever did, do, though live ninety. Oh, Jupiter, talking Ben Gunn! Why, mischief person. Silver!” he cried. “Silver! I will give piece advice,” he continued cook drew near again; “do not great hurry treasure.” “Why, sir, I possible, are not,” said Silver. “I only, asking pardon, save life boy’s seeking treasure; may lay that.” “Well, Silver,” replied doctor, “if so, I will go one step further: look squalls find it.” “Sir,” said Silver, “as man man, that is much little. What you are after, left block house, given chart, I do not know, now, I? And yet I done bidding eyes shut never word hope! But no, here is much. If will not tell mean plain out, say I will leave helm.” “No,” said doctor musingly; “I have right say more; it is secret, see, Silver, or, I give word, I would tell you. But I will go far I dare go, step beyond, I will wig sorted captain I am mistaken! And first, I will give bit hope; Silver, get alive wolf-trap, I will best save you, short perjury.” Silver’s face radiant. “You could not say more, I am sure, sir, mother,” he cried. “Well, that is first concession,” added doctor. “My second piece advice: keep boy close beside you, need help, halloo. I am seek you, show I speak random. Good-bye, Jim.” And Dr. Livesey shook hands stockade, nodded Silver, set brisk pace wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint’s Pointer “JIM,” said Silver alone, “if I saved life, saved mine; I will forget it. I seen doctor waving run it--with tail eye, I did; I seen say no, plain hearing. Jim, that is one you. This first glint hope I since attack failed, I owe you. And now, Jim, we are go treasure-hunting, sealed orders too, I do not like it; must stick close, back back like, we will save necks spite fate fortune.” Just man hailed us fire breakfast ready, soon seated sand biscuit fried junk. They lit fire fit roast ox, grown hot could approach windward, even without precaution. In wasteful spirit, cooked, I suppose, three times could eat; one them, empty laugh, threw left fire, blazed roared unusual fuel. I never life saw men careless morrow; hand mouth word describe way doing; wasted food sleeping sentries, though bold enough brush done it, I could see entire unfitness anything like prolonged campaign. Even Silver, eating away, Captain Flint upon his shoulder, word blame recklessness. And surprised me, I thought he never shown cunning he then. “Aye, mates,” said he, “it is lucky Barbecue think head. I got I wanted, I did. Sure enough, ship. Where it, I do not know yet; hit treasure, we will jump find out. And then, mates, us boats, I reckon, upper hand.” Thus he kept running on, his mouth full hot bacon; thus he restored hope confidence, and, I suspect, repaired his time. “As hostage,” he continued, “that is his last talk, I guess, he loves dear. I have got piece news, thanky that; it is done. I will take line go treasure-hunting, we will keep like much gold, case accidents, mark, meantime. Once got ship treasure sea like jolly companions, we will talk Mr. Hawkins over, will, we will give his share, sure, his kindness.” It wonder men good humour now. For part, I horribly cast down. Should scheme he sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly traitor, would hesitate adopt it. He still foot either camp, doubt he would prefer wealth freedom pirates bare escape hanging, best he hope side. Nay, even things fell he forced keep his faith Dr. Livesey, even danger lay us! What moment would suspicions his followers turned certainty he I fight dear life--he cripple I boy--against five strong active seamen! Add double apprehension mystery still hung behaviour friends, unexplained desertion stockade, inexplicable cession chart, harder still understand, doctor’s last warning Silver, “Look squalls find it,” readily believe little taste I found breakfast uneasy heart I set forth behind captors quest treasure. We made curious figure, anyone see us--all soiled sailor clothes armed teeth. Silver two guns slung him--one one behind--besides great cutlass his waist pistol pocket his square-tailed coat. To complete his strange appearance, Captain Flint sat perched upon his shoulder gabbling odds ends purposeless sea-talk. I line waist followed obediently sea-cook, held loose end rope, his free hand, his powerful teeth. For world, I led like dancing bear. The men variously burthened, carrying picks shovels--for first necessary brought ashore HISPANIOLA--others laden pork, bread, brandy midday meal. All stores, I observed, came stock, I could see truth Silver’s words night before. Had he struck bargain doctor, he his mutineers, deserted ship, must driven subsist clear water proceeds hunting. Water would little taste; sailor usually good shot; besides that, short eatables, likely would flush powder. Well, thus equipped, set out--even fellow broken head, certainly kept shadow--and straggled, one another, beach, two gigs awaited us. Even bore trace drunken folly pirates, one broken thwart, muddy unbailed condition. Both carried along us sake safety; so, numbers divided them, set forth upon bosom anchorage. As pulled over, discussion chart. The red cross was, course, far large guide; terms note back, hear, admitted ambiguity. They ran, reader may remember, thus: Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing point N. N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. E. Ten feet. A tall tree thus principal mark. Now, right us anchorage bounded plateau two three hundred feet high, adjoining north sloping southern shoulder Spy-glass rising towards south rough, cliffy eminence called Mizzen-mast Hill. The top plateau dotted thickly pine-trees varying height. Every there, one different species rose forty fifty feet clear neighbours, particular “tall tree” Captain Flint could decided spot, readings compass. Yet, although case, every man board boats picked favourite his ere half-way over, Long John alone shrugging his shoulders bidding wait till there. We pulled easily, Silver’s directions, weary hands prematurely, quite long passage, landed mouth second river--that runs woody cleft Spy-glass. Thence, bending left, began ascend slope towards plateau. At first outset, heavy, miry ground matted, marish vegetation greatly delayed progress; little little hill began steepen become stony foot, wood change character grow open order. It was, indeed, pleasant portion island approaching. A heavy-scented broom many flowering shrubs almost taken place grass. Thickets green nutmeg-trees dotted red columns broad shadow pines; first mingled spice aroma others. The air, besides, fresh stirring, this, sheer sunbeams, wonderful refreshment senses. The party spread abroad, fan shape, shouting leaping fro. About centre, good way behind rest, Silver I followed--I tethered rope, he ploughing, deep pants, among sliding gravel. From time time, indeed, I lend hand, he must missed his footing fallen backward hill. We thus proceeded half mile approaching brow plateau man upon farthest left began cry aloud, terror. Shout shout came him, others began run his direction. “He cannot ’a found treasure,” said old Morgan, hurrying past us right, “for that is clean a-top.” Indeed, found also reached spot, something different. At foot pretty big pine involved green creeper, even partly lifted smaller bones, human skeleton lay, shreds clothing, ground. I believe chill struck moment every heart. “He seaman,” said George Merry, who, bolder rest, gone close examining rags clothing. “Leastways, good sea-cloth.” “Aye, aye,” said Silver; “like enough; would not look find bishop here, I reckon. But sort way bones lie? ’Tain’t natur’.” Indeed, second glance, seemed impossible fancy body natural position. But disarray (the work, perhaps, birds fed upon slow-growing creeper gradually enveloped his remains) man lay perfectly straight--his feet pointing one direction, his hands, raised his head like diver’s, pointing directly opposite. “I have taken notion old numbskull,” observed Silver. “Here is compass; there is tip-top p’int Skeleton Island, stickin’ like tooth. Just take bearing, you, along line bones.” It done. The body pointed straight direction island, compass read duly E.S.E. E. “I thought so,” cried cook; “this p’inter. Right line Pole Star jolly dollars. But, thunder! If do not make cold inside think Flint. This one HIS jokes, mistake. Him six alone here; he killed  them, every man; one he hauled laid compass, shiver timbers! They are long bones, hair’s yellow. Aye, would Allardyce. You mind Allardyce, Tom Morgan?” “Aye, aye,” returned Morgan; “I mind him; he owed money, he did, took knife ashore him.” “Speaking knives,” said another, “why do not find his’n lying round? Flint warn’t man pick seaman’s pocket; birds, I guess, would leave be.” “By powers, that is true!” cried Silver. “There are not thing left here,” said Merry, still feeling round among bones; “not copper doit baccy box. It do not look nat’ral me.” “No, gum, do not,” agreed Silver; “not nat’ral, nice, says you. Great guns! Messmates, Flint living, would hot spot me. Six were, six we; bones now.” “I saw dead deadlights,” said Morgan. “Billy took in. There he laid, penny-pieces his eyes.” “Dead--aye, sure enough he is dead gone below,” said fellow bandage; “but ever sperrit walked, would Flint’s. Dear heart, he died bad, Flint!” “Aye, he did,” observed another; “now he raged, he hollered rum, he sang. ‘Fifteen Men’ his song, mates; I tell true, I never rightly liked hear since. It main hot, windy open, I hear old song comin’ clear clear--and death-haul man already.” “Come, come,” said Silver; “stow talk. He is dead, he do not walk, I know; leastways, he will not walk day, may lay that. Care killed cat. Fetch ahead doubloons.” We started, certainly; spite hot sun staring daylight, pirates longer ran separate shouting wood, kept side side spoke bated breath. The terror dead buccaneer fallen spirits. 32 The Treasure-hunt--The Voice Among Trees PARTLY damping influence alarm, partly rest Silver sick folk, whole party sat soon gained brow ascent. The plateau somewhat tilted towards west, spot paused commanded wide prospect either hand. Before us, tree-tops, beheld Cape Woods fringed surf; behind, looked upon anchorage Skeleton Island, saw--clear across spit eastern lowlands--a great field open sea upon east. Sheer us rose Spyglass, dotted single pines, black precipices. There sound distant breakers, mounting round, chirp countless insects brush. Not man, sail, upon sea; largeness view increased sense solitude. Silver, he sat, took certain bearings his compass. “There three ‘tall trees’” said he, “about right line Skeleton Island. ‘Spy-glass shoulder,’ I take it, means lower p’int there. It is child’s play find stuff now. I have half mind dine first.” “I do not feel sharp,” growled Morgan. “Thinkin’ Flint--I think were--as done me.” “Ah, well, son, praise stars he is dead,” said Silver. “He ugly devil,” cried third pirate shudder; “that blue face too!” “That rum took him,” added Merry. “Blue! Well, I reckon he blue. That is true word.” Ever since found skeleton got upon train thought, spoken lower lower, almost got whispering now, sound talk hardly interrupted silence wood. All sudden, middle trees front us, thin, high, trembling voice struck well-known air words: “Fifteen men dead man’s chest-- Yo-ho-ho, bottle rum!” I never seen men dreadfully affected pirates. The colour went six faces like enchantment; leaped feet, clawed hold others; Morgan grovelled ground. “It is Flint, ----!” cried Merry. The song stopped suddenly began--broken off, would said, middle note, though someone laid his hand upon singer’s mouth. Coming clear, sunny atmosphere among green tree-tops, I thought sounded airily sweetly; effect companions stranger. “Come,” said Silver, struggling his ashen lips get word out; “this will not do. Stand go about. This rum start, I cannot name voice, it is someone skylarking--someone that is flesh blood, may lay that.” His courage come back he spoke, colour his face along it. Already others begun lend ear encouragement coming little themselves, voice broke again--not time singing, faint distant hail echoed yet fainter among clefts Spy-glass. “Darby M’Graw,” wailed--for word best describes sound--“Darby M’Graw! Darby M’Graw!” again; rising little higher, oath I leave out: “Fetch aft rum, Darby!” The buccaneers remained rooted ground, eyes starting heads. Long voice died away still stared silence, dreadfully, them. “That fixes it!” gasped one. “Let us go.” “They his last words,” moaned Morgan, “his last words board.” Dick his Bible praying volubly. He well brought up, Dick, he came sea fell among bad companions. Still Silver unconquered. I could hear his teeth rattle his head, he yet surrendered. “Nobody island ever heard Darby,” he muttered; “not one us that is here.” And then, making great effort: “Shipmates,” he cried, “I am get stuff, I will beat man devil. I never feared Flint his life, and, powers, I will face dead. There is seven hundred thousand pound quarter mile here. When ever gentleman fortune show his stern much dollars boozy old seaman blue mug--and dead too?” But sign reawakening courage his followers, rather, indeed, growing terror irreverence his words. “Belay there, John!” said Merry. “Do not cross sperrit.” And rest terrified reply. They would run away severally dared; fear kept together, kept close John, his daring helped them. He, his part, pretty well fought his weakness down. “Sperrit? Well, maybe,” he said. “But there is one thing clear me. There echo. Now, man ever seen sperrit shadow; well then, what is he echo him, I like know? That are not natur’, surely?” This argument seemed weak enough me. But never tell affect superstitious, wonder, George Merry greatly relieved. “Well, that is so,” he said. “You have head upon shoulders, John, mistake. ’Bout ship, mates! This crew wrong tack, I believe. And come think it, like Flint’s voice, I grant you, clear-away like it, all. It liker somebody else’s voice now--it liker--” “By powers, Ben Gunn!” roared Silver. “Aye, were,” cried Morgan, springing his knees. “Ben Gunn were!” “It do not make much odds, it, now?” asked Dick. “Ben Gunn’s body more’n Flint.” But older hands greeted remark scorn. “Why, nobody minds Ben Gunn,” cried Merry; “dead alive, nobody minds him.” It extraordinary spirits returned natural colour revived faces. Soon chatting together, intervals listening; long after, hearing sound, shouldered tools set forth again, Merry walking first Silver’s compass keep right line Skeleton Island. He said truth: dead alive, nobody minded Ben Gunn. Dick alone still held his Bible, looked around he went, fearful glances; he found sympathy, Silver even joked his precautions. “I told you,” said he--“I told sp’iled Bible. If are not good swear by, suppose sperrit would give it? Not that!” he snapped his big fingers, halting moment his crutch. But Dick comforted; indeed, soon plain lad falling sick; hastened heat, exhaustion, shock his alarm, fever, predicted Dr. Livesey, evidently growing swiftly higher. It fine open walking here, upon summit; way lay little downhill, for, I said, plateau tilted towards west. The pines, great small, grew wide apart; even clumps nutmeg azalea, wide open spaces baked hot sunshine. Striking, did, pretty near north-west across island, drew, one hand, ever nearer shoulders Spy-glass, other, looked ever wider western bay I tossed trembled coracle. The first tall trees reached, bearings proved wrong one. So second. The third rose nearly two hundred feet air clump underwood--a giant vegetable, red column big cottage, wide shadow around company could manoeuvred. It conspicuous far sea east west might entered sailing mark upon chart. But size impressed companions; knowledge seven hundred thousand pounds gold lay somewhere buried spreading shadow. The thought money, drew nearer, swallowed previous terrors. Their eyes burned heads; feet grew speedier lighter; whole soul bound fortune, whole lifetime extravagance pleasure, lay waiting them. Silver hobbled, grunting, his crutch; his nostrils stood quivered; he cursed like madman flies settled his hot shiny countenance; he plucked furiously line held time time turned his eyes upon deadly look. Certainly he took pains hide his thoughts, certainly I read like print. In immediate nearness gold, else forgotten: his promise doctor’s warning things past, I could doubt he hoped seize upon treasure, find board HISPANIOLA cover night, cut every honest throat island, sail away he first intended, laden crimes riches. Shaken I alarms, hard keep rapid pace treasure-hunters. Now I stumbled, Silver plucked roughly rope launched his murderous glances. Dick, dropped behind us brought rear, babbling prayers curses his fever kept rising. This also added wretchedness, crown all, I haunted thought tragedy acted plateau, ungodly buccaneer blue face--he died Savannah, singing shouting drink--had there, his hand, cut his six accomplices. This grove peaceful must rung cries, I thought; even thought I could believe I heard ringing still. We margin thicket. “Huzza, mates, together!” shouted Merry; foremost broke run. And suddenly, ten yards further, beheld stop. A low cry arose. Silver doubled his pace, digging away foot his crutch like one possessed; next moment he I come also dead halt. Before us great excavation, recent, sides fallen grass sprouted bottom. In shaft pick broken two boards several packing-cases strewn around. On one boards I saw, branded hot iron, name WALRUS--the name Flint’s ship. All clear probation. The CACHE found rifled; seven hundred thousand pounds gone! 33 The Fall Chieftain THERE never overturn world. Each six men though he struck. But Silver blow passed almost instantly. Every thought his soul set full-stretch, like racer, money; well, he brought up, single second, dead; he kept his head, found his temper, changed his plan others time realize disappointment. “Jim,” he whispered, “take that, stand trouble.” And he passed double-barrelled pistol. At time, he began quietly moving northward, steps put hollow us two five. Then he looked nodded, much say, “Here narrow corner,” as, indeed, I thought was. His looks quite friendly, I revolted constant changes I could forbear whispering, “So you have changed sides again.” There time left answer in. The buccaneers, oaths cries, began leap, one another, pit dig fingers, throwing boards aside so. Morgan found piece gold. He held perfect spout oaths. It two-guinea piece, went hand hand among quarter minute. “Two guineas!” roared Merry, shaking Silver. “That is seven hundred thousand pounds, it? You are man bargains, are not you? You are never bungled nothing, wooden-headed lubber!” “Dig away, boys,” said Silver coolest insolence; “you will find pig-nuts I should not wonder.” “Pig-nuts!” repeated Merry, scream. “Mates, hear that? I tell now, man knew along. Look face you will see wrote there.” “Ah, Merry,” remarked Silver, “standing cap’n again? You are pushing lad, sure.” But time everyone entirely Merry’s favour. They began scramble excavation, darting furious glances behind them. One thing I observed, looked well us: got upon opposite side Silver. Well, stood, two one side, five other, pit us, nobody screwed high enough offer first blow. Silver never moved; he watched them, upright his crutch, looked cool ever I saw him. He brave, mistake. At last Merry seemed think speech might help matters. “Mates,” says he, “there is two alone there; one’s old cripple brought us blundered us this; other’s cub I mean heart of. Now, mates--” He raising his arm his voice, plainly meant lead charge. But then--crack! crack! crack!--three musket-shots flashed thicket. Merry tumbled head foremost excavation; man bandage spun round like teetotum fell his length upon his side, he lay dead, still twitching; three turned ran might. Before could wink, Long John fired two barrels pistol struggling Merry, man rolled his eyes last agony, “George,” said he, “I reckon I settled you.” At moment, doctor, Gray, Ben Gunn joined us, smoking muskets, among nutmeg-trees. “Forward!” cried doctor. “Double quick, lads. We must head  them boats.” And set great pace, sometimes plunging bushes chest. I tell you, Silver anxious keep us. The work man went through, leaping his crutch till muscles his chest fit burst, work sound man ever equalled; thinks doctor. As was, he already thirty yards behind us verge strangling reached brow slope. “Doctor,” he hailed, “see there! No hurry!” Sure enough hurry. In open part plateau, could see three survivors still running direction started, right Mizzenmast Hill. We already boats; four sat breathe, Long John, mopping his face, came slowly us. “Thank ye kindly, doctor,” says he. “You came nick, I guess, Hawkins. And it is you, Ben Gunn!” he added. “Well, you are nice one, sure.” “I am Ben Gunn, I am,” replied maroon, wriggling like eel his embarrassment. “And,” he added, long pause, “how do, Mr. Silver? Pretty well, I thank ye, says you.” “Ben, Ben,” murmured Silver, “to think you have done me!” The doctor sent back Gray one pick-axes deserted, flight, mutineers, proceeded leisurely downhill boats lying, related words taken place. It story profoundly interested Silver; Ben Gunn, half-idiot maroon, hero beginning end. Ben, his long, lonely wanderings island, found skeleton--it he rifled it; he found treasure; he dug (it haft his pick-axe lay broken excavation); he carried his back, many weary journeys, foot tall pine cave he two-pointed hill north-east angle island, lain stored safety since two months arrival HISPANIOLA. When doctor wormed secret afternoon attack, next morning he saw anchorage deserted, he gone Silver, given chart, useless--given stores, Ben Gunn’s cave well supplied goats’ meat salted himself--given anything everything get chance moving safety stockade two-pointed hill, clear malaria keep guard upon money. “As you, Jim,” he said, “it went heart, I I thought best stood duty; one these, whose fault it?” That morning, finding I involved horrid disappointment he prepared mutineers, he run way cave, leaving squire guard captain, taken Gray maroon started, making diagonal across island hand beside pine. Soon, however, he saw party start him; Ben Gunn, fleet foot, dispatched front his best alone. Then occurred work upon superstitions his former shipmates, he far successful Gray doctor come already ambushed arrival treasure-hunters. “Ah,” said Silver, “it fortunate I Hawkins here. You would let old John cut bits, never given thought, doctor.” “Not thought,” replied Dr. Livesey cheerily. And time reached gigs. The doctor, pick-axe, demolished one them, got aboard set go round sea North Inlet. This run eight nine miles. Silver, though he almost killed already fatigue, set oar, like rest us, soon skimming swiftly smooth sea. Soon passed straits doubled south-east corner island, round which, four days ago, towed HISPANIOLA. As passed two-pointed hill, could see black mouth Ben Gunn’s cave figure standing it, leaning musket. It squire, waved handkerchief gave three cheers, voice Silver joined heartily any. Three miles farther, inside mouth North Inlet, meet HISPANIOLA, cruising herself? The last flood lifted her, much wind strong tide current, southern anchorage, never found her more, found her stranded beyond help. As was, little amiss beyond wreck main-sail. Another anchor got ready dropped fathom half water. We pulled round Rum Cove, nearest point Ben Gunn’s treasure-house; Gray, single-handed, returned gig HISPANIOLA, he pass night guard. A gentle slope ran beach entrance cave. At top, squire met us. To he cordial kind, saying nothing escapade either way blame praise. At Silver’s polite salute he somewhat flushed. “John Silver,” he said, “you are prodigious villain imposter--a monstrous imposter, sir. I told I prosecute you. Well, then, I not. But dead men, sir, hang neck like mill-stones.” “Thank kindly, sir,” replied Long John, saluting. “I dare thank me!” cried squire. “It gross dereliction duty. Stand back.” And thereupon entered cave. It large, airy place, little spring pool clear water, overhung ferns. The floor sand. Before big fire lay Captain Smollett; far corner, duskily flickered blaze, I beheld great heaps coin quadrilaterals built bars gold. That Flint’s treasure come far seek cost already lives seventeen men HISPANIOLA. How many cost amassing, blood sorrow, good ships scuttled deep, brave men walking plank blindfold, shot cannon, shame lies cruelty, perhaps man alive could tell. Yet still three upon island--Silver, old Morgan, Ben Gunn--who taken his share crimes, hoped vain share reward. “Come in, Jim,” said captain. “You are good boy line, Jim, I do not think me’ll go sea again. You are much born favourite me. Is you, John Silver? What brings here, man?” “Come back dooty, sir,” returned Silver. “Ah!” said captain, he said. What supper I night, friends around me; meal was, Ben Gunn’s salted goat delicacies bottle old wine HISPANIOLA. Never, I sure, people gayer happier. And Silver, sitting back almost firelight, eating heartily, prompt spring forward anything wanted, even joining quietly laughter--the bland, polite, obsequious seaman voyage out. 34 And Last THE next morning fell early work, transportation great mass gold near mile land beach, thence three miles boat HISPANIOLA, considerable task small number workmen. The three fellows still abroad upon island greatly trouble us; single sentry shoulder hill sufficient ensure us sudden onslaught, thought, besides, enough fighting. Therefore work pushed briskly. Gray Ben Gunn came went boat, rest absences piled treasure beach. Two bars, slung rope’s end, made good load grown man--one he glad walk slowly with. For part, I much use carrying, I kept busy day cave packing minted money bread-bags. It strange collection, like Billy Bones’s hoard diversity coinage, much larger much varied I think I never pleasure sorting them. English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Georges, Louises, doubloons double guineas moidores sequins, pictures kings Europe last hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped looked like wisps string bits spider’s web, round pieces square pieces, pieces bored middle, wear round neck--nearly every variety money world must, I think, found place collection; number, I sure like autumn leaves, back ached stooping fingers sorting out. Day day work went on; every evening fortune stowed aboard, another fortune waiting morrow; time heard nothing three surviving mutineers. At last--I think third night--the doctor I strolling shoulder hill overlooks lowlands isle, when, thick darkness below, wind brought us noise shrieking singing. It snatch reached ears, followed former silence. “Heaven forgive them,” said doctor; “it is mutineers!” “All drunk, sir,” struck voice Silver behind us. Silver, I say, allowed his entire liberty, spite daily rebuffs, seemed regard quite privileged friendly dependent. Indeed, remarkable well he bore slights unwearying politeness he kept trying ingratiate all. Yet, I think, none treated better dog, unless Ben Gunn, still terribly afraid his old quartermaster, myself, really something thank for; although matter, I suppose, I reason think even worse anybody else, I seen meditating fresh treachery upon plateau. Accordingly, pretty gruffly doctor answered him. “Drunk raving,” said he. “Right were, sir,” replied Silver; “and precious little odds which, me.” “I suppose would hardly ask call humane man,” returned doctor sneer, “and feelings may surprise you, Master Silver. But I sure raving--as I morally certain one, least, fever--I leave camp, whatever risk carcass, take assistance skill.” “Ask pardon, sir, would wrong,” quoth Silver. “You would lose precious life, may lay that. I am side now, hand glove; I should not wish see party weakened, let alone yourself, seeing I know I owes you. But men there, could not keep word--no, supposing wished to; what is more, could not believe could.” “No,” said doctor. “You are man keep word, know that.” Well, last news three pirates. Only heard gunshot great way supposed hunting. A council held, decided must desert island--to huge glee, I must say, Ben Gunn, strong approval Gray. We left good stock powder shot, bulk salt goat, medicines, necessaries, tools, clothing, spare sail, fathom two rope, particular desire doctor, handsome present tobacco. That last island. Before that, got treasure stowed shipped enough water remainder goat meat case distress; last, one fine morning, weighed anchor, could manage, stood North Inlet, colours flying captain flown fought palisade. The three fellows must watching us closer thought for, soon proved. For coming narrows, lie near southern point, saw three kneeling together spit sand, arms raised supplication. It went hearts, I think, leave wretched state; could risk another mutiny; take home gibbet would cruel sort kindness. The doctor hailed told stores left, find them. But continued call us name appeal us, God’s sake, merciful leave die place. At last, seeing ship still bore her course swiftly drawing earshot, one them--I know was--leapt his feet hoarse cry, whipped his musket his shoulder, sent shot whistling Silver’s head main-sail. After that, kept cover bulwarks, next I looked disappeared spit, spit almost melted sight growing distance. That was, least, end that; noon, inexpressible joy, highest rock Treasure Island sunk blue round sea. We short men everyone board bear hand--only captain lying mattress stern giving his orders, though greatly recovered he still want quiet. We laid her head nearest port Spanish America, could risk voyage home without fresh hands; was, baffling winds couple fresh gales, worn reached it. It sundown cast anchor beautiful land-locked gulf, immediately surrounded shore boats full Negroes Mexican Indians half-bloods selling fruits vegetables offering dive bits money. The sight many good-humoured faces (especially blacks), taste tropical fruits, lights began shine town made charming contrast dark bloody sojourn island; doctor squire, taking along them, went ashore pass early part night. Here met captain English man-of-war, fell talk him, went board his ship, and, short, agreeable time day breaking came alongside HISPANIOLA. Ben Gunn deck alone, soon came board he began, wonderful contortions, make us confession. Silver gone. The maroon connived his escape shore boat hours ago, he assured us he done preserve lives, would certainly forfeit “that man one leg stayed aboard.” But all. The sea-cook gone empty-handed. He cut bulkhead unobserved removed one sacks coin, worth perhaps three four hundred guineas, help his wanderings. I think pleased cheaply quit him. Well, make long story short, got hands board, made good cruise home, HISPANIOLA reached Bristol Mr. Blandly beginning think fitting her consort. Five men sailed returned her. “Drink devil done rest,” vengeance, although, sure, quite bad case ship sang about: With one man her crew alive, What put sea seventy-five. All us ample share treasure used wisely foolishly, according natures. Captain Smollett retired sea. Gray saved his money, suddenly smit desire rise, also studied his profession, he mate part owner fine full-rigged ship, married besides, father family. As Ben Gunn, he got thousand pounds, he spent lost three weeks, exact, nineteen days, he back begging twentieth. Then he given lodge keep, exactly he feared upon island; he still lives, great favourite, though something butt, country boys, notable singer church Sundays saints’ days. Of Silver heard more. That formidable seafaring man one leg last gone clean life; I dare say he met his old Negress, perhaps still lives comfort her Captain Flint. It hoped so, I suppose, his chances comfort another world small. The bar silver arms still lie, I know, Flint buried them; certainly shall lie me. Oxen wain-ropes would bring back accursed island; worst dreams ever I I hear surf booming coasts start upright bed sharp voice Captain Flint still ringing ears: “Pieces eight! Pieces eight!”
