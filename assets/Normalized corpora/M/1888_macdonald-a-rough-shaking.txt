 A ROUGH SHAKING. Chapter I. How I Came know Clare Skymer. It day everything around seemed almost perfect: everything does, then, come nearly right moment two, preparatory coming right good last. It third week June. The great furnace glowing shining full force, driving ship life her best speed ocean space. For deck, decks, aloft, much going one time another, I may well say she going her best speed, quality well rate motion. The trees well clothed, best. Their garments soaking light heat, wind going among them, telling one another, well, getting immense amount comfort-work single minute. It said word two often passed me, made happier boy I know present, I old man, ought easily made happy mere beginner. I walking thin edge little wood big trees, slope green left stretching away sunny distance, shadows trees right lying feet. The earth grass trees air together weaving harmony, birds leading big orchestra--which indeed largest scale. For instruments different, meant sound; part others odour, others yet shine, still others motion; birds turned nearly words could. Presently, complete score, I heard tones man's voice, strong sweet. It talking one way I could understand. I mean I could understand words: I far even hear them; I could understand voice came modulated. It deep, soft, musical, something like coaxing it, something tenderness, intent puzzled me. For I could conjecture age, sex, relation, kind person words spoken. You tell voice man talking himself; ought evident he talking woman; can, surely, tell he talking child; could tell he speaking made him; would pretty certain he holding communication his dog: made feel strange I could tell kind ear open gentle manly voice saying things sound made long hear. I confess hurrying pace little, I trust improper curiosity, see--I cannot say interlocutors, I heard, still heard, one voice. About minute's walk brought corner wood stopped abruptly, giving way field beautiful grass; I saw something need old delighted withal: boy would taken pleasure it, I count half-way gallows. Up edge wood came, I say, large field--acres acres sweetest grass; dividing wood path stood fence three bars, moment separated two genuine lovers ever wall “stones lime hair knit up” could sundered. On one side fence stood man whose face I could see, one loveliest horses I ever set eyes upon. I better middling fair horseman, but, horse's sake, I may allowed mention friends look horse think buying. He sixteen hands, well rounded barrel, clean limbs, small head, broad muzzle; hollows his eyes hazy blue, delicacy feature, revealed quite old horse. His ears pointed forward downward, wanted account get hold man nose busily caressing. Neither, I presume, heard approach; true-love-endearments shy, man his arm round horse's neck, caressing his face, talking much Philip Sidney's lady, whose lips “seemed kiss speak,” murmured her pet sparrow, voice musical baritone. That something ordinary person would likely understand appeared patent. Whether I made involuntary sound I cannot tell: I taken sight, bearing aspect something eternal, I know I carried myself; horse gave little start, half lifted his head, saw me, threw up, uttered shrill neigh warning, stepped hack pace, stood motionless, waiting apparently order his master--if indeed I ought rather call friends master servant. The man looked round, saw me, turned toward me, showing sign appearance unexpected, lifted his hat courtesy Englishmen would reserve lady, advanced step, almost welcome guest. I may owed something reception fact he saw man advanced years, beard gray, means prematurely. I saw one nearly, quite old myself. His hair beard, rather long, quite white. His face wonderfully handsome, stillness summer sea upon it. Its features marked regular fine, habit man rather spare. What his white hair beard, certain radiance his pale complexion, which, I learned afterward, sun ever browned little, he reminded moment he turned, Cato shore Dante's purgatorial island. “I fear,” I said, “I intruded!” There path I come along. The man laughed--and his laugh friendly invitation dinner. “The land mine,” he answered; “no one say intrude.” “Thank heartily. I live far off, know country pretty well, got part I ignorant.” “You welcome go property,” he answered. “I could close field without sense thrown fellow-being dungeon. Whatever rights land, space belong individual '_as were_,' use Shakspere-phrase. All best things shared. The house plainly designed family.” While he spoke I scarce heeded his words looking man, much he interested me. His face palest health, faint light within. He looked sixty years age. His forehead square, his head rather small, beautifully modelled; his eyes light hazel, friendly celestial dog. Though slender build, he looked strong, every movement denoted activity. I ready answer he said. He turned me, introduce companion render interview easier, he called, tone gentle he spoke child, peculiar intonation let understand child he speaking, “Memnon! come;” turned me. His movement words directed attention horse, stood motionless. At once, without sign haste, animal walked rails, rose gently his hind legs, came without touching, walked his master, laid his head his shoulder. I bethought man was. He year two neighbourhood, though property stood his good many years. Some said he bought it; others knew he inherited it. All agreed he peculiar person, ways oddly unreasonable evident he had, his wanderings face earth, gradually lost hold sense he might one time possessed, consequence good deal cracked. There seemed nothing, however, his behaviour appearance suggest conclusion: man could hardly counted beside he terms friendship his horse. It took moment recall his name--Skymer--one odd enough assist memory. I caught ere he done mingling fresh caresses his long-tailed friend. When I came know better, I knew he thus given opportunity--such he would horse--of thinking whether I like know better: Mr. Skymer's way offer himself, give easy opportunity might wish know him. I learned afterward he knew name suspected person: rather prejudiced favour kind thing I wrote, he waiting see whether approximation would follow. “Pardon rude lingering,” I said; “that lovely animal enough make one desire nearer acquaintance his owner. I do not think I ever saw perfect creature!” I remembered next moment I heard said Mr. Skymer he liked beasts better men, I soon found one foolish things constantly said honest men understand them. There women even love dogs dislike children; but, nauseous fact is, nauseous fact men believe animal rights, God animals, think may please them, indulging cost insane thirst knowledge. Injustice may discover facts, never truth. “I grant nearly perfect creature,” he answered, “But he far nearly perfect yet know him! Excuse speaking confidently; half far men, Memnon horse, kingdom heaven would good deal nearer!” “He seems old horse!” “He old horse--much older think seeing come paling he did. He forty.” “Is possible!” “I know prove his age certainly own. He son Arab mare English thoroughbred.--Come here, Memnon!” The horse, standing behind like servant waiting, put his beautiful head his master's shoulder. “Memnon,” said Mr. Skymer, “go home tell Mrs. Waterhouse I hope bring gentleman lunch.” The horse walked gently past us, started quick trot, almost immediately became gallop. “The dear fellow,” said his master, “would gallop like he hard road; he knows I would like it.” “But, excuse me, animal convey message?--how communicate he knows, he understand say him?” “He least take care housekeeper look his mane knot perhaps observe tie it.” “You code signals knots then?” “Yes--comprising half dozen possibilities.--I hope object message I sent! You honour lunching me?” “You kind,” I answered--with little hesitation, I suppose, fearing bore new acquaintance. “Do not make false horse housekeeper, Mr. Gowrie,” he resumed.--“I put horse first, I could easily explain thing Mrs. Waterhouse Memnon.” “Could explain Memnon?” “I try!” he answered, peculiar smile. “You hold bound keep faith horse?” “Bound man--that is, far horse understand me. A word understood binding, whether spoken horse, man, pig. It makes important little, must work slowly, education lower animals. It seems absolute horror man lie inferior creature. Just think--if angel lie us! What shock find reposing faith devil.” “Excuse me--I thought said _an angel_!” “When he lied, would he devil?--But let us follow Memnon, walk I tell him.” He turned wood. “The horse,” I said, pointing, “went way!” “Yes,” answered his master; “he knew nearer take long way round. If I started one dogs together, horse would gone way, dog taken path following.” We walked score two yards silence. “You promised tell wonderful horse!” I said. “With pleasure. I delight talking poor brothers sisters! Most savages yet, would far fewer treat slaves instead friends. One day, however, well us--thank God.” “I hope so,” I responded heartily. “But please tell me,” I said, “something Memnon.” Mr. Skymer thought moment. “Perhaps, all,” he rejoined, “his best accomplishment he fetch carry like dog. I tell one his feats way. But first must know that, travelled good deal, wild countries, I picked things well know, even best kind. A man may fail knowing second best! I Memnon, five twenty miles home, I came cottage I found woman lying ill. I saw wanted. The country strange me, I could found doctor. I wrote little pencil-note, fastened saddle, told horse go home bring housekeeper gave him--and spare himself. He went steady trot ten twelve miles hour. I went cottage, and, awaiting his return, I could woman. I confess I felt anxious!” “You well might,” I said: “why say _confess_?” “Because I business anxious.” “It business her could.” “I that! If I had not been, I good anxious! But I knew another looking her; anxious meddle his part!” “I see now,” I answered, said nothing time. “What lather poor Memnon came back in! You seen him! He gone nearly five hours, neither time distance accounted state he in. I let anything week. I sit night, I sitting rate. The poor fellow caught, made his escape. His bridle broken, several long skin wounds his belly, he scraped top wall set bits glass. How far he galloped, telling.” “Not vain, I hope! The poor woman?” “She recovered. The medicine right pocket flap saddle. Before morning she much better, lived many years after. Memnon I lose sight her.--But seen huge creature lying floor cabin like worn-out dog, abandoned content! I rubbed carefully, well I could, tied poncho round him, I let go sleep. Then soon patient seemed quieted night, I made big fire her peats, slept like two babies, snored.--The woman beat,” he added merry laugh. “It first, almost time I ever heard horse snore.--As walked home next day he kept steadily behind me. In general walked side side. Either he felt tired talk me, he satisfied something happened day before. Perhaps he careless, allowed taken. I think likely.” “What loss he dies!” I said. He looked grave instant, replied cheerfully-- “Of course I shall miss dear fellow--but he miss me; good us both.” “Then,” said I,--a little startled, I confess, “you really think--” I stopped. “Do _you_ think, Mr. Gowrie,” he rejoined, answering unpropounded question, “that God like Jesus Christ, would invent delight his children society love animals, let death part ever? I do not.” “I heartily willing disciple matter,” I replied. “I know well,” he resumed, “the vulgar laugh serves poor public sufficient answer anything, common-place retort: 'You cannot give shadow proof theory!'--to I answer, 'I never fool imagine I could; surely go bed night expecting rise morning, surely I expect see dear old Memnon I wake many Christians call sleep knows waking.'--Think, Mr. Gowrie, think children heaven--what superabounding joy creatures would them!--There one class, however,” he went on, “which I like see wait got creatures back;--I mean foolish women who, pleasure, spoil dogs make people hate them, best keep rising scale God's creation.” “They do not know better!” I said. For every time he stopped, I wanted hear he would say next. “True,” he answered; “but much want know right way anything? They good lovely instincts--like dogs, care right way wrong way following them?” We walked silence, coming near side small wood. “I hope I shall interfere plans day!” I said. “I seldom plans day,” he answered. “Or I have, made break easily. In general I wait. The hour brings plans it--comes tell wanted me. It done now. And see, Memnon attendance us!” There, sure enough, horse, side paling fenced wood well-kept country-road. His long neck stretched toward his master. “Memnon,” said Mr. Skymer issued gate, “I want carry gentleman home.” I often enough youth ridden without saddle, seldom indeed without sort bridle, however inadequate: I not, first thought thing, relish mounting without one horse I knew he his master better terms I ever seen man horse upon before. But even thought passing head, Memnon lying feet, flat his equine rotundity would permit. Ashamed doubt, I lost moment placing position suggested Sir John Falstaff Prince Hal defence his bulky carcase--astride body animal, namely. At he rose lifted natural relation man horse. Then he looked round his master, set leisurely pace. “You captive!” I said. “Memnon I,” answered Mr. Skymer, “will make captivity pleasant.” A silence followed thanks. In procession horse foot, went half mile ere anything said worth setting down. Then began evidence drawing nigh house: grassy lane hedges moving, gradually changing character. First came trees hedge-rows. Then hedges gave way trees--a grand avenue splendid elms beeches alternated. The ground feet loveliest sward, us sun came sweetest shadow. A glad heave instant subsidence live power me, let know Memnon's delight feeling soft elastic turf his feet: he said himself, “Now shall gallop!” immediately checked thought reflection he longer colt ignorant manners. “What lovely road turf makes!” I said. “It lower sky--solidified feet yet angelic.” My host looked brighter smile he shown before. “It kind road I really like,” he said, “--though turf disadvantages! I much place bear. Such roads will not carriages!” “You ride good deal, I suppose?” “I do. I one time accustomed horseback that, without thinking, I aware whether I horse's feet own.” “Where, may I ask, friend favour carry 'this weight size,' come from?” “He born England, his mother Syrian--of one oldest breeds known. He born arms, week never touched ground. Next month, I think I mentioned, he forty years old!” “It great age horse!” I said. “The shame well pity!” he answered. “Then think horses might live longer?” “Much longer allowed live country,” he answered. “And part punishment know them. We treat selfishly live long enough become friends. At present men worthy friendship. What else man's admiration, without love respect justice, bitter form despite! It small wonder many stupid horses, receive little education, bad associates, die much young gained ripe experience transmit posterity. Where would humanity now, went five-and-twenty?” “I think must right. I possession moment, given one loved her, ink-stand made hoof pony died age least forty-two, her part work pair till within year two her death.--Poor little Zephyr!” “Why, Mr. Gowrie, talk her she Christian!” exclaimed Mr. Skymer. “That is talked Memnon moment ago! Where difference? Not size, though Memnon would make three Zephyr!” “I did not say _poor Memnon_, I? You said _poor Zephyr_! That way Christians talk friends gone home grand old family mansion! Why do, would hardly like one tell them!” “It true,” I responded. “I understand now! I do not think I ever heard widow speak her departed husband without putting _poor_, _poor dear_, his name.--By way, hear woman speak her _late_ husband, help thinking her ready marry again?” “It sound she done him! But gate!--Call, Memnon.” The horse gave clear whinny, gentle, loud enough heard distance. It tall gate wrought iron, Memnon's summons answered one could clear it--though open he: little bird, I ornithologist enough recognize--mainly short-sightedness, I hope--came fluttering long avenue within, perched top gate, looked party moment debating prudent, dropped suddenly Memnon's left ear, thence his master's shoulder, he sat till gate opened. The little one went half-way inner avenue us, making several flights returns he left us. The boy opened gate, chubby little fellow seven, looked Mr. Skymer's face he his father king one, stood gazing long he sight. I noticed also--who could failed notice?--that every bird would drop tree passing under, alight minute host's head. Once he happened uncover it, seven eight perched together upon it. One tiny bird got caught his beard claws. “You cannot surely tamed _all_ birds grounds!” I said. “If I have,” he answered, “it permitting themselves.” “You mean nature birds friendly man?” “I do. Through long ages men enemies, alienated them--they themselves.” “You mean unfriendliness natural men?” “It cannot human cruel!” “How it, then, many boys careless suffering inflict?” “Because blood men loved cruelty, never repented it.” “But account men loving cruelty--for say contrary nature?” “Ah, I could account that, I secret things! All I meant half-explain was, came many wish inflict suffering, yet careless inflicting it.” I saw must know better he would quite open his mind me. I saw though, hospitable heart, he threw his best rooms open all, others his house he invite every acquaintance. The avenue led wide gravelled space plain, low, long building whitish stone, pillared portico. In middle space fountain, close chairs. Mr. Skymer begged seated. Memnon walked fountain, lay down, I might get his back easily I got it. Once down, he turned his side, lay still. “The air mild,” said host, “I fancy prefer house.” “Mild!” I rejoined; “I call hot!” “I much real heat!” he returned. “Notwithstanding love turf, I keep much gravel sake desert.” I took seat he offered me, wondering whether Memnon comfortable he lay; and, absorbed horse, see host go side basin. Suddenly “clothed upon” house which, though came indeed earth, might well come direct heaven: great uprush water spread us tent-like dome, sun came cool, broken, almost frosty glitter. We seemed heart huge soap-bubble. I exclaimed delight. “I thought would enjoy sun-shade!” said Mr. Skymer. “Memnon I often come hot morning, nobody wants us. Do not we, Memnon?” The horse lifted his nose little, made low soft noise, chord mingled obedience delight--a moan pleasure mixed half-born whinny. We seated many moments, scarcely pushed shore silence new sea talk, interrupted invasion half dozen dogs. They sorts sort. Mr. Skymer called one Tadpole--I suppose he hugest tail, his legs visible without looked for. “That animal,” said his master, “--he looks like dog, would positive he was!--is cleverest pack. He seems rare individuality. His ancestors must sorts, he gathered every good quality possessed each. Think man might be--made way!” “Why man?” I said. “There may men. There must many one day,” he answered, “--but yet. Men must first made willing noble.” “And do not think men willing made noble?” “Oh yes! willing enough, them, _made_ noble!” “I understand. I thought said not!” “They willing enough _to made_ noble; different willing _to be_ noble: takes trouble. How one become noble desires little fight it!” The man drew more. He way talking things seldom mentioned except dull fashion pulpit, he cared them. He spoke familiar things, made feel he looking high window. There many never speak real things except false tone; man spoke without atom assumed solemnity--in his ordinary voice: came his mind home--not dreams night, facts day. I sat while, gazing thin veil water blue sky far beyond. I thought like veil little life here, overdomed boundless foreshortening space. The lines Shelley's _Adonais_ came me: “Life, like dome many-coloured glass, Stains white radiance Eternity, Until Death tramples fragments.” Then I thought host said concerning short lives horses, wondered he would say dogs. “Dogs intelligent horses,” I said: “why live yet shorter time?” “I doubt would say Arab's tent,” he returned. “If said, 'still affectionate,' I known better answer you.” “Then I say so,” I replied. “And I return, live longer. They find world good enough them, die, leave it.” “They much happier life horses!” “Many dogs horses, I grant.” That instant arose I fancied must unusual sound place: two dogs fighting. The master got up. I thought myself, “Now shall see his notions discipline!” I long wait. In his hand small riding-whip, I afterward found he always carried avoidance inflict heavier punishment inability inflict lighter; he held wrong-doing man deal with, kindest thing punish, but, animals especially, punish once. He ran conflicting parties. They separated moment heard sound his coming. One came cringing crawling his feet; other--it nondescript Tadpole--stood little way off, wagging his tail, cocking his head his master's face. He gave one his feet several pretty severe cuts whip, sent off. The drew nearer. His master turned away took notice him. “May I ask,” I said, he returned his seat, “why punish animals breach peace?” “They deserve it.” “How could tell that? You looking quarrel began!” “Ah, see I know dogs! One them--I saw glance was--had found bone, dog-rule finding is, find yours. The other, notwithstanding, wanted share. It Tadpole found bone, he--partly his sense justice--cannot endure his claims infringed upon. Every dog knows Tadpole must right.” “He looked he expected approve his conduct!” “Yes, worst Tadpole! he self-righteous imagine he deserves praise standing his rights! He dog, see, knows better!” “I noticed disregarded his appeal.” “I going praise nothing!” “You expect understand treatment?” “No one tell infinitesimally small beginnings understanding, life, may be. The way make animals reasonable--more reasonable, I mean--is treat reasonable. Until go abysses creation, cannot know nature begins see difference quality action.” “I confess,” I said, “Mr. Tadpole seem little ashamed he went away.” “And see Blanco White feet, taking care touch them. He giving time, he thinks, anger pass.” He laughed merriest laugh. The dog looked eagerly, dropped his head again. If I go like this, however, I shall take another book tell story I began present! In short, I drawn man never another since friend youth went I shall go seek find one day--or, likely, one solemn night. I greatly his inferior, love quick divider shares: he gathers much nothing over, he gathers little lack. I soon ceased think _new_ friend, I seemed known I born. I going tell early part his history. If I could tell deserves told! The interesting story may narrated eyes Shakspere could spy shine underneath dull surface. He never told great portion tale his life continuously. One thing would suggest another--generally connection time. I pieced parts together myself. He indeed set twice give his history, always got discussing something, interrupted. I write I set order he narrating: modest man world would way put disadvantage. The constant recurrence capital _I_, apt rouse mind reader, especially he egotistic, less irritation egotism narrator--while reality freedom man's personal utterance _may_ owing his lack egotistic. Partly friend's sake, therefore, I shall tell story as--what indeed is--a narrative concerning him. Chapter II With his parents. The lingering, long-drawn-out _table d'hôte_ dinner one inns _cornice_ road. The gentlemen gone garden, ladies _salotto_, open windows admitted odours many flower blossoming tree, toward end spring region. One sat tinkling piano, striking chords, her pleasure company. Two three looking garden, diaphanous veil twilight speedily thickened crape night, darkness filled thousands small isolated splendours--fire-flies, “golden boats” never seen “on sunny sea,” haunting eves young summer, pulsing, pulsing dusky air seeming aimlessness, like sweet thoughts faith bind one. A tall, graceful woman stood one windows alone. She never Italy before, never seen fire-flies, absorbed beauty motion much golden flashes. Each roving star tide light rose ebbed moved, seemed push radiance, ever waxing waning. In wide, complicated dance, wove huge, warpless tapestry weft ever vanishing aureate shine. The lady, Englishwoman evidently, gave little sigh looked round, regretting, apparently, her husband her side look loveliness woke faint-hued fairy-tale her heart. The moment he entered room came her. He man middle height, slenderness his figure, looked taller he was. He vivacity motion, readiness turn his heel, free swing shoulders, erect carriage head, marked man action: one speculated his calling would immediately his sense fitness satisfied he heard he commander English gun-boat, he his way Genoa join. He young--within twenties, though looking two three thirty, his face browned sun wind. His features regular attractive, his eyes dark liveliness movement seemed hardly accord weight colour. His wife fair, large eyes deepest blue eyes. She looked delicate, lovely. They married five years. A friend brought his yacht far Nice, going land. From Genoa lady must find her way home without her husband. The lights room extinguished present might better see fire-flies, he put his arm round her waist. “I am glad you are come, Henry!” she said, favoured piano. “I uncomfortable lovely sight myself!” “It lovely, darling!” he rejoined; then, moment's pause, added, “I hope able sleep without sea rock you!” “No fear that!” she answered. “The stillness delightful. I thoroughly reconciled motion yacht,” she went on, “but satisfaction feeling solid earth you, knowing keep steady night.” “I glad like change. I never sleep first night shore.--I cannot tell is, somehow I keep wishing Fyvie could taken us way.” “Never mind, love. I keep awake you.” “It is that! How could I mind lying awake beside me! Oh Grace, do not know, cannot know, me! I do not feel least you are half, people say. You are like part all; think would sacrilege! You quite another, else could mine! You make forget altogether. When I look you, I stand enchanted mirror cannot show front it.” “No, Harry; I am true mirror, I hold inside remains outside me.” “I fear you have got beyond me!” said her husband, laughing. “You always do!” “Yes, nonsense, Harry.” “Then speech nonsense, it?” “No; full sense. But think something would like say; I must fetch boy see fire-flies; I come back I say it.” She left room. Her husband stood he was, gazing out, tender look his face deepened sadness--whether haunting thought his wife's delicate health his leave her, strange foreboding, I cannot tell. When presently she returned one child her arms, he made haste take her. “My darling,” he said, “he much heavy you! How stupid think it! If do not promise never home, I take sea me!” The child, fair, bright boy, sleep whose eyes turned wonder, seemed see everything, quite satisfied nothing, went readily his father, looked back his mother. The sign he gave he delighted fire-flies was, he looked one, his parents, speechless, shining eyes. He knew feeling like himself. Silent communion enough. The father turned carry back bed. The mother turned look them. As she so, her eyes fell upon two three delicate, small-leaved plants--I know were--that stood pots balcony front open window: shivering. The night perfectly still, leaves trembled ague-fit. “Look, Harry! What that?” she cried, pointing them. He turned looked, said must loaded wagon passing, went child. “I hope to-morrow like to-day!” said his wife he returned. “What shall it?--our one real holiday, know!” “I notion head,” he answered. “That little town Georgina spoke of, far here--among hills: shall go see it?” Chapter III. Without his parents. The sun England seems shine he cannot help it; sun Italy seems shine he means it, wants mean it. Thus he shone next morning, including his attentions curious little couple, husband wife, who, attended guide, borne animals might mules might donkeys, lovely look except sympathy ugliness, slowly ascending steep terraced zigzagged road, olive trees them. They south side hill, olives gave none little shadow power, trees next sun always road. The man often wiped his red, innocent face, looked little distressed; lady, although stout he, seem suffer, perhaps she sheltered large bonnet After silence good many minutes, she first speak. “I cannot say I am disappointed olives, Thomas,” she remarked. “They are not much keep sun you!” “They would not look bad along brookside Essex!” returned her husband. “Here seem bit place!” “Well, but, poor things! help it--with trayful earth feet! If planted priest terrace he would soon thin they!” They passed stout priest, low broad hat, cassock, she laughed merrily her small joke. They English country parson his wife, abroad first time middle-aged lives, happy children school. Incapable disliking anybody, unkindness Mrs. Porson's laughter. “I do not see,” she resumed, “how ever picnic country!” “Why not?” “There is place sit down!” “Here is whole hill-side!” “But hard!” she answered. “There is inch turf grass direction!” The pair--equally plump, equally good-natured--laughed together. I need give talk. It better talk, yet worth recording. Their guide, perceiving knew Italian he English, withdrawn rear, stumped along behind way, holding much converse his donkeys however, admonishing one, one, seeming little hurt behaviour, judge expostulations accompanied his occasionally potent arguments. Assuredly speed made small; festa, hot. They way small town distance shore, crest hill ascending. It would, number inhabitants, England village, villages Riviera. However insignificant place may be, none less town, possibly walled town. Somebody told Mr. Mrs. Person ought visit Graffiacane, Graffiacane therefore bound: ought visit it, seen there, took readiest way know. The place indeed curious one, high among hills, top hill, approaches like trenches siege. All old towns region seem climbed look heads things. Graffiacane saw hills valleys many another town--each church standing highest, guardian flock houses beneath it; saw many water-course, mostly dry, lovely oleanders growing middle it; saw multitudinous oliveyards vineyards; saw mills great wheels, little ribbons water drive them--running sometimes along tops walls get work; saw rugged pines, ugly, verdureless, raw hillsides--away sea, lying heat like heavenly vat tails peacocks God making, lay steeped proper dye. Numerous sharp turns donkeys made ascent; corner that, sweetest life-giving wind would leap upon travellers, lying wait surprise heavenliest old earth, young her years, could give them. But getting tired enjoy anything, indeed far asleep backs humble beasts, sudden, determined yet cheerful assault guide upon his donkeys, roused riders; looking sleepily up, his loud _heeoop_ ringing ears, sense insidious approach two headaches, saw little town, houses gathered close protection, like brood chickens, white steeple church rising them, like neck love-valiant hen. Passing narrow arch low-browed gateway, hot hour, sudden cold struck bones. For ray light shone narrow street. The houses lofty city, parted little width street friends opposite sides might almost windows shaken hands. Narrow, rough, steep old stone-stairs ran inside houses, doors open air--here, however, none sweetest. Everywhere shadow; everywhere one another evil odour; everywhere look abject dirty poverty--to English eye, is. Everywhere pretty children, young, slatternly mothers, withered-up grandmothers, gleam glowing reds yellows, coolness subdued greens fine blues. Such least composite first impression made Mr. Mrs. Porson. As festa, men usual looking cavern-like doorways hand-wrought iron balconies, leaning backs door-posts, smoking lazy stop. Many women prayers church. All orderly, quieter usual festa. None could told reason; townsfolk hardly aware undefinable oppression upon them--an oppression lay also upon visitors, donkeys toiled hills slow-climbing valleys. It added gloom consequent humidity town sides streets connected, height two perhaps three stories, thin arches--mere jets stone one house other, rare instance smallest superstructure keep key arch. Whatever intention them, might seem serve it, time straddled undisturbed sufficed moss even grass grow upon Mr. Porson regarded curious speculation. A bit architect, foiled, he summoned last Italian he could, supplemented Latin terminational _o_ _a_ tacked French English word offered help, succeeded, he believed, gathering by-stander, arches earthquakes. He language enough sort pursue matter, else he would asked his informant arch looking could service, seeing weight top, slight endlong pressure must burst up. Turning away tell his wife he learned, he checked low rumbling, like distant thunder, he took firing festa guns, discovered Italians fond kinds noises. The next instant felt ground feet move side side confused motion. A sudden great cry arose. One moment every stair, every door, like animals holes, came men, women, children, rush. The earthquake upon them. But narrow streets, danger could hardly less inside houses, which, older especially, ill constructed--mostly boulder-stones neither angles edges, hence little grasp beyond friction weight, adhesion poor old friable cement, gave them; Italians, genius building, careless certain constructive essentials. After twenty seconds shaking, lonely pair began hear, noise cries people, houses rumbling earth. They far bewildered frightened. They good nerve, know degree danger in, strangeness thing contributed excitement helped courage. I cannot say might behaved hotel full countrymen countrywomen, running shrieking, altogether comporting knew God. The fear sides might infected them; terror inhabitants knew better thing meant, much shake them. For one moment many people stood street motionless, pale, staring; next began run, gateway, greater part street, staggering ran. The movement ground indeed small--not more, perhaps, half inch direction--but fear imagination weakened limbs. They run far, however, terrible unrest ceased suddenly begun. The English pair drew long breath stood--for stirred step, indeed thought whither run--and imagining hundred years, looked around them. Their guide disappeared. The two donkeys stood perfectly still heads hanging down. They seemed deep dejection, incapable movement. A men yet seen. They running street. In moment would empty. They last let women go church without them. They hurrying join sanctuary, one safe place: rest town might shaken heaps foundations, church would stand! Guessing goal, Porsons followed them. But neither build condition make haste, road uphill. No one place, however, far another within toy-town, came presently open _piazza_, upper side rose great church. It square front, masking squareness triangular gable building. Upon screen, brightest colours, magenta sky-blue predominating, represented day judgment--the mother seated right hand judge, casting pitiful look upon miserable assembly her left. The square good deal slope, went slowly church, kept looking picture. The last tatters skirt crowd disappeared great door, square empty. All picture gazing, spread wall painted, whole bulk huge building began shudder, went shuddering--“just,” Mr. Porson used say describing thing friend, “like skin horse determined get rid gad-fly.” The moment tiles roof began clatter like many castanets hands giants, ground wriggle heave. But much absorbed eyes heed much went feet. The oscillatory displacement front church seem cover hand-breadth, enough. Down came plaster surface, judge his mother, clashing pavement below, good bad yet stood trembling. A people came running out, thinking open square safer church, rush open air. The shaking lasted twenty seconds, half minute, when, without indication eyes watching front, came roaring crash huge rumbling, far which, rose multitudinous shriek terror, dismay, agony, number men women issued shot catapult. Then came straggling out, then--no more. The roof fallen upon rest. With first rush church, shaking ceased utterly, still earth seemed immovable thing English spectators conceived her. Of taken place little sign earth, sign blue sun-glorious heaven; air cloud dust thick look almost solid, cloud, seemed, came ghastly cry, mingled shrieks groans articulate appeals help. The cry kept issuing, calm front church, dominated frightful canopy, went displaying assembled nations delivered awful judge. While multitude groaned within, spread sun silent composure, welcoming cherishing his rays left gorgeous hues. The Porsons stood moment stunned, came senses, made haste enter building. With white faces trembling hands, drew aside heavy leather curtain hung within great door, could moment see nothing; air inside seemed filled solid yellow dust As eyes recovered sudden change sunlight gloom, however, began distinguish larger outlines, perceived floor one confused heap rafters bricks tiles stones lime. The centre roof great dome; nothing eyes clear heaven slowly vanishing cloud ruin. In mound could first distinguish nothing human--could told, dim chaos, limbs broken rafters. Eager help, dared set feet upon mass--not feared walls another shock might bring upon heads, shuddered lest added weight crush live human creature could descry. Three four received little hurt, moving edges heap, vaguely trying lift this, that, yielding attempt despair, either evident uselessness, lack energy. They would give pull beam lay across writhing figure, find immovable, turn groan farther cry. How help? Others began come white faces terror-stricken eyes; long sepulchral ruin little groups it, endeavouring shiftless fashion bring rescue prisoned souls. The Porsons saw nothing could do. Great beams rafters beyond power move inch, lay crossed directions; could hold little communication fashion work. Alas, little better vainly busy, louder moans accompanying attempts revealed added tortures sought deliver! The two saw plainly now, could distinguish contorted limbs, countenance. The silence, seldom broken, growing terrible. Had known many buried there, would wondered left able cry out. At moments absolute stillness dreadful place. The heart Mrs. Porson began sink. “Do come out,” she whispered, afraid her voice. “I feel sick faint, I fear I shall drop.” As she spoke something touched her leg. She gave cry started aside. It hand, body belonged nothing could seen. It must last movement; stuck motionless. Then spied amid sad sights sadder still. Upon heap, little way edge, sat child three, dressed like sailor, gazing something--they could see what. Going little nearer, saw it--the face fair woman, evidently English, lay dead, great beam across her heart. The child showed trace tears; his white face seemed frozen. The stillness upon despair, suggested world hope never yet born. Pity drove Mrs. Porson's sickness away. “My dear!” she said; child took heed. Her voice, however, seemed wake something him. He started his feet, rushing beam, began tug his tiny hands. Mrs. Porson burst tears. “It is use, darling!” she cried. “Wake mamma!” he said, turning, looking her. “She wake,” sobbed Mrs. Porson. Her husband stood speechless, choking back tears which, Englishman, he ashamed. “She _will_ wake,” returned boy. “She always wakes I kiss her.” He knelt beside her, prove upon her white face efficacy measure he never known fail. That he already tried plain, he kissed away much dust, though none death. When he found she even close her lips return his passionate salute, he desisted. With saddest things, child's sigh, look seemed Mrs. Porson embody riddle humanity, he reseated beam, his little feet his mother's bosom, often she made warm. He weep; he fix his eyes his mother; his look level moveless set upon nothing. He seemed utter blank--as outer wall creation risen frowning front, he knew nothing behind chaos. “Where papa?” asked Mr. Porson. The boy looked round bewildered. “Gone,” he answered; could get anything him. “Was papa here?” asked Mrs. Porson. He answered word _Gone_, uttered dazed fashion. By time men left town best, direction intelligent man, priest neighbouring parish. They already got one two alive, priest dead. They worked well, terror lurking earthquake forgotten eagerness rescue. From ignorance language, however, Mr. Porson saw could little use; dread harm good, he judged better go. They stood one moment looked silence. The child dropped beam, lay fast asleep across his mother's bosom, his head lump mortar. Without word spoken, Mrs. Person, picking her way carefully spot, knelt dead mother, tenderly kissed her cheek, lifted sleeping child, awe, nearly tremulous joy first motherhood, bore her husband. The throes earthquake slain parents, given child arms. Without look consultation, mark difference, sign agreement, turned silence left terrible church, clear summer sky looking upon dead. As passed door, sun met shining his might. The sea, far away across tops hills clefts valleys, lay basking his glory. The hot air quivered wide landscape. From flight steps front church looked streets town, beyond space. It looked best possible worlds--as neither plague, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, human wrongs, persuade not, judged high intent existence. When man knows intent, I dare think I do, _then_ let say, till then, whether good world not. That midst splendour sunny day, midst olives oranges, grapes figs, ripening swiftly fervour circumambient air, lie charnel-church, terrible fact, neither ignored, explained paltry theory greatest good greatest number; end maker's dream this. When turned street led gate, found donkeys standing left them. Their owner them. He gone church rest, killed. When caught sight patient, dejected animals, unheeded unheeding, first spoke, whispering awful stillness world: must take creatures, make best way back without guide! They judged that, road chiefly hill, donkeys would going home, would much difficulty them. At worst, short stout were, bad walkers, felt equal carrying child them. Not person street mounted; almost church, strange, terrible service. Mrs. Porson mounted strongest animals, her husband placed sleeping child her arms, started, he foot side his wife, his donkey following. No one saw pass gate town. They sure way, partly asleep came, long went downward, leave road, could hardly go wrong! The child slept way. Chapter IV. The new family. How shall man describe passed mind childless wife, motherless boy her arms! It loveliest provision, doubtless, every child mother his own; mother-love--which I almost called divine--the love, namely, woman bears child he child, regardless whether he her another's. It may learn love thus, women children. Some women love without any. No conceivable treasure world could entered comparison burden richness Mrs. Porson bore. She told afterward, voice hushed fear irreverence, how, went one hills, she slept moment, dreamed she Mary holy thing her arms, fleeing Egypt ass, Joseph, her husband, walking her side. For years years longing child--and lay divinest little one, every mark kingdom upon him! His father mother lying crushed fallen dome fearful church, strange he seem belong her? But might one somewhere world better claim; possibly--horrible thought!--with need she! Up started hideous cupidity, fierce temptation dishonesty, she never imagined. We know us temptation comes. Then devil fight. And Mrs. Porson fought him. Mr. Porson was, milder degree, affected much his wife. He could help wishing, he wrong wishing, that, since child's father mother gone, might take place, love orphan. They far rich, one child! They might surely manage give good education, set himself! But, alas, might others--others love-property child! The thoughts working each, neither dared utter presence sleeping treasure. As descended last slope town, wide sea-horizon them, beheld glory after-sunset as, even coast, unusual. A chord colour might prostrate fragment gigantic rainbow, lay along large arc horizon. The farther portion sea indigo blue, save grayish line parted dusky red sky. This red faded orange dingy yellow pale green pale blue, came depth blue night, rayed resplendent evening star. Below star nearer west, lay, thin long, sickle new moon. If death looks unthinking soul, heavens declare glory God, indeed heart knows him, discord heaven earth argument harmonize. But death men think it, “Blessed mourn dead.” The sight enhanced wonder hope two honest good souls treasure carried. Out bosom skeleton Death himself, given them--into arms--a germ life, jewel heaven! At thought lay hill behind them, felt joy child almost wicked; God taken child's father mother, might glad hope he chosen replace them? That he moment least, bound believe! They travelled slowly on, dying sunset, hour two star-bright night followed, adorned rather lighted quaint boat crescent moon. Weary, lapt voiceless triumph, came last, guided donkeys, hotel. All talking earthquake. A great part English fled panic terror, like sheep shepherd--hunted fears, betrayed imagined faith. The steadiest church-goer fled like infidel he reviled. The fool said his heart, “There God,” fled. The Christian said his mouth, “Verily God ruleth earth!” fled--far he could place which, he fancied, shown signs special presence father Jesus Christ. After Persons house, came two three small shocks. Every time, cry rushed inhabitants streets; every time, garden hotel swarmed left Germans English. But little couple, day seen much terrors one else place, whose chamber top house swaying worst, much absorbed watching tending lovely boy heed earthquake. Perhaps hearts whispered, “Can given us gift unfriendly?” “If his father mother,” said Mrs. Person, stood regarding him, “are permitted see child, shall see love him, willing he love us!” As went stairs him, boy woke When he looked saw face his mother's, cloud swept across heaven his eyes. He closed again, speak. The first shocks came putting bed: he turned white looked fixedly, waiting another fall above, sat motionless his new mother's lap. The instant vibration rocking ceased, he drank cup milk she offered him, quietly distant thunder rolled away. When she put bed, he looked her indescribable expression bewildered loss, she burst tears. The child cry. He cried since took him. The woman's heart like break him, she managed say, “God taken her, darling. He keeping her you, I going keep her;” she kissed him. The moment came second shock. Need wakes prophecy: need child made parson prophet. “It God shaking,” he said. “It is right. Nobody worse--not much, least!” “Not all,” rejoined boy, turned his face away. From lips tiny child, words seemed almost awful. He fell fast asleep, never woke till morning. Mrs. Porson lay beside him, yielding him, stout she was, good half little Italian bed. She scarcely slept excitement fear smothering him. The Persons honest people, desire possess child, made secret found him, much his name he could tell them, _Clare_. But never heard inquiry him. On gunboat Genoa knew nothing commander's purposes, seek him. Days passed began uneasy him, make search could, fruitless. Chapter V. His new home. The place good people carried gift earthquake--carried much anxiety exultation--had distinctive features. It many fields grass, many crop, lying fallow--all softly undulating. It trees, everywhere hedges dividing fields whose strange shapes witnessed complicated history, could tell anything. Here hollows motionless earth-billows, flowed, seem flow, called brook. But brooks like deep soundless pools without beginning end. There life, gaiety, song them, sullen consent exist. That least impress one accustomed real brooks, lark-like, always quiver, always move, always babbling gabbling gamboling, always games, always tossing pebbles about, telling talk. A man loved might say silence these, speech those; silence better song delight are, were, be! The stillness may full solemn fish, mysterious itself, deaf secrets; blessed brook let us light joy shine. Dull place must seem description, country boy. He would come contact modest beauty day us would year. Nobody quite knows beauty country, especially quiet country, except one born it, least childhood boyhood youth opened door door hidden phases life. There square yard face earth one part understand God meant making it; changeful skies canopy picturesque dullest landscapes; winds wake blow desert pasture land, making bosoms youth age swell delight blowing. The winds full delicious odours gathered pass gardens, fields, hill-sides; burden sweetness. Those blew upon little Clare oftener filled smell farmyards, burning weeds, cottage-fires, flowers; never would one odours revisit without bringing fresh delight his heart. Its mere memorial suggestion far great sea would wake old child man. The pollards along brooks grew lovely his heart, less lovely he came understand lovely God meant be. He one who, regarding thing _is_, comparing things, descry thought God it, love it; love beautiful natural love mothers. The parsonage his new father mother brought like landscape--humble. It humble even parsonage--which occasion fine. For men women whose business teach fellows true fair, covet fine things, hypocrites, best intruders humbugs, want fine things themselves. Jesus Christ care fine things. He loved every lovely thing ever his father made. If one know difference fine things lovely things, he know much, he science world his finger-ends. One good thing parsonage was, aid, swallows loved centuries. That way Clare learned love swallows--and worth loving. Then old garden, nearly old-fashioned old, many flowers almost ceased seen grew it, enjoy lives less fashion. All furniture house old, mostly shabby; possible, therefore, love little. Who earth could fool love new piece furniture! One might prize it; one might admire it; one might like pretty, comfortable; silly woman whose soul went bed her new sideboard, could say she loved it. And would true. It impossible _old_ piece furniture loved. His father mother charming little room made garret, right among swallows, soon admitted member society--an honorary member, is, expected fly Africa except he liked. His new parents saw that, he could them, he preferred himself; moods came upon he would steal away even them, seized longing loneliness. In general, next his mother anywhere, he liked his father study. If went out, could take them, he would either go his room, sit study alone. It untidy room, crowded books, mostly old dingy, torn bindings. Many owner never opened, suffered consequence; constantly his hands, suffered consequence. All smelt strong stale tobacco, hardly accounts fact Clare never took smoking. Another thing perhaps does--that he always much man want look like man imitating men. That unmanly. A boy wants look like man manly boy, men care his company. A true boy always welcome true man, would-be man better side wall. His mother oftenest sat tiny little drawing-room, smelt withered rose-leaves. I think must smell still. I believe smelt hundred years she saw place. Clare loved smell rose-leaves disliked smell tobacco; yet he preferred study dingy books pretty drawing-room without his mother. There village, small one, parish, good many farm-houses. Such place Clare spent next years his life, his new parents loved heartily. The thing troubled them, besides possibility losing him, was, could draw tiniest smile upon his sweet, moonlight-face. Chapter VI. What draw his first smile. Mr. Porson man five forty; his wife years younger. His theories religion neither large lofty; he accepted handed him, trouble whether correct. He better: he tried constantly obey law God, whether he found Bible his heart. Thus he greater kingdom heaven thousands knew more, better theories God, could talk much fluently concerning religion he. By obeying God he let God teach him. So his heart always growing; heart grows, fear intellect; also grows, best fashion growth. He good his people, foolishly kind. He tried his best help ought be, make bear troubles, true one another, govern themselves. He like father them. For some, course, he could little, locked boxes nothing them; he much. Perhaps he good his flock God gave little Clare bring up. Perhaps he his wife good Clare, wonderful thing took place. About three years earthquake, Mrs. Porson baby-girl sent her her own. The father mother thought happiest couple face earth--and knows were! If not, much better! then, happy were, happier yet they; who, his greatest happiness, would happier still know earth held happier he! When Clare first saw baby, he looked her solemn, unmoved countenance, gazed changeless whole minute. He thought another earthquake, another church-dome fallen, another child found brought home ruin. Then light began grow somewhere his face. His mother, full her heart her new child, watched his countenance anxiously. The light his face grew grew, till his face radiant. Then midst shining broke heavenliest smile she ever seen human countenance--a smile clearer revelation God ten thousand books him. For must God be, made boy smiled smile never knew it! After he smiled occasionally, though seldom. He never laughed--that is, years time; but, hand, he never looked sullen. A quiet peace, like stillness long summer twilight north, dwelt upon his visage, appeared model his every motion. Part his life seemed away, he waiting come back. Then he would merry! He never hurry, yet always something--always, is, he his room. There his mother would sometimes find sitting absolutely still, his hands his knees. Nor she sorry surprise thus, she sure one his rare smiles. She thought he must dreaming his mother, pang would go her thought he would one day love her herself. “He laugh then!” she said. She think gratitude mother would one day overwhelm her gladness. He never sought caressed, always snuggled one drew close. Never he push one away. He learned lessons set him--not fast, persistent endeavour understand. He greatly given reading, particularly quick. He thus escaped much, fancying he knew he know--a quicksand fall many clever boys girls. Give slow, steady boy, knows he know thing! To know know, small prophet. Such boy glimmer something he know, least place is; boy easily grasps words stand thing, apt think he knows thing he sees wrapper it--thinks he knows church he caught sight weather-cock. Mrs. Porson could see understanding thing gradually burst blossom boy's face. It smile, shone. Understanding light; needs love change light smile. There something boy his parents hardly hoped understand; something his face made long know going him, made doubt ever life should. He concealing anything them. He know he anything tell, wanted know anything. He never doubted everybody saw he felt himself; his soul seemed bare world. But he knew little passing him: child man never knows small part that. When first he allowed take little one his arms, he sitting stool his mother's feet, almost new start his existence. A new confidence born his spirit. Mrs. Person could read, reflected his countenance, pride tenderness composed much her conscious motherhood. A certain staidness, almost sternness, took possession his face he bent helpless creature, half his knees, half his arms--the sternness protecting divinity knew danger afar. He taken step upward being; he aware himself, without knowing it, dignity fatherhood. Even he knew many seem never learn, man defender weak; that, man his brother's keeper, still he his sister's. She belonged him, therefore he slavery love, alone freedom. So reverential careful he show himself, soon his mother trusted him, extent his power, nurse. By she made delightful discovery that, he alone baby, silent boy could talk. Where need hope understood, his words began flow--with rhythmical cadence seemed ever verge verse. When first his mother heard sweet murmur his voice, she listened; first she learned hold terrible thing given her arms upon him. For she heard half singing, half saying-- “Baby, baby, grow. Keep small, lie lap, dream walking, never walk; walk run, run go away father mother--away big place ground goes sky; go ground goes sky, come big church, go church; ground church sky go _hurr, hurr, hurr_; sky, full angels, come great roar; yards sails drop sky, tumble father mother, hold cannot get again; nobody me. I I can, I brother Clare, want, want, want mother father, mother father, always coming, never come, ever long! Do not grow big girl, Maly!” The mother could think say. She went in, and, hope turning his thoughts aside, took baby, made haste consult her husband. “We must leave it,” said Mr. Person. “Experience soon correct mistake his notion. It far wrong. You I must go one day: sky fall us, bodies get more! He thinks time nearer hand sakes I hope is; nobody tell.” Clare never associated church awful thing took place, church he went Sundays. The time it, he imagined, came everybody. To Clare, nothing ever _happened_. The way world church city set hill, earthquake always ready. The heart his adoptive mother grew yet tender toward coming her child. She quite sure she love even Mary. She could help feeling he child heaven sent nurse earth; reward her care her darling sent her. That love boy something coming girl, I believe myself, though something was, I precisely understand. She left less often alone child. She would his thoughts drawn church earthquake; neither would she mournfulness his sweet voice much ears her baby. He never sang minor key one by, always solely baby he alone together. Chapter VII. Clare his brothers. After year two, Mr. Person became anxious lest boy grow unlike boys--lest he manly, gently sad behaviour. He began, therefore, take parish, delighted find show extraordinary endurance. He would walk many miles, come home less fatigued his companion. To sure, he much weight carry; seemed Mr. Porson his utter freedom thought large share his immunity weariness. He continued slight thin--which natural, he growing fast; muscles his little bird-like legs seemed steel. The spindle-shanks went striding, striding without check, along roughest roads, pale face shining atop like sweet calm moon. To Mr. Person's eyes, moon, stooping, she sometimes seems do, downward sky, always looked like him. The child woke something new heart mind every one loved him, unconscious his influence. His company check his father meditating, his habit he walked, he say his people next Sunday. For good man never wrote read sermon, talked his people one would meet him. Hence always believed “the parson meant it.” He never said anything clever, never said anything unwise; never amused them, never made feel scornful, either one else. Instead finding presence Clare distract his thoughts, he times curious sense boy teaching him--that his sermon running before, walking sedately side that. For Clare could run like wind; run butterflies, dragon-flies, anything offered chance seeing nearer; he never killed, seldom tried catch anything, moment's examination. The swiftest run would scarcely heighten colour his pale cheeks. He soon came known farm-houses parish. The farmer-families little shy first, fancying fine little gentleman them; got know him, grew fond him. They called “the parson's man,” pleased Clare. But one old woman called “the parson's cherubim.” One day Mr. Porson calling house largest farm parish, nearest house parsonage. The farmer's wife ill, go her room see her, he said boy-- “Clare, run yard. Give compliments one meet, ask let stay him.” When time came departure, Mr. Porson went find him. He call him; he wanted see he about. Unable discover him, coming upon one he might inquire, hay-time everybody fields, he last driven use his voice. He call twice. Out covered part pigsty, far parson stood, boy came creeping fours, followed litter half-grown, grunting, gamboling pigs. “Here I am, papa!” he cried. “Clare,” exclaimed his father, “what mess made yourself!” “I gave compliments,” answered boy, he scrambled fence his father's assistance, “and asked I might stay till ready. They said yes, invited in. I went in; we have games! They kind me.” His father turned involuntarily looked sty. There stood pigs row, gazing boy, looking sorry thick skins bony snouts would let them. Their mother rose ridge behind them, gazing too. Mr. Skymer always spoke pigs intelligent animals world. I know his love animals began, he could tell me. If began pigs, far ending them. The next day he asked his father he might go call upon pigs. “Have forgotten, Clare,” said his mother, “what job Susan I clothes? I wonder still could done thing! They quite filthy. When I saw you, I half mind put bath, clothes all. I doubt sweet yet!” “Oh, yes, are, indeed, mamma!” returned Clare; “and know I shall careful this! I shall go house, get farmer let out. I have thought new game them!” His mother consented; farmer let pigs out; Clare right good game together among ricks yard. His growing nature showed swiftly widening friendship live things. The spreading ripples his affection took cows horses, hens geese, every creature place, till length pull moles, he could get them. I doubt he would liked he seen one eat frog! He called pigs little brothers, horses cows big brothers, perfectly home people knew he cared company. I think his absolute simplicity brought near fountain life, rather, prevented straying it; kept alive himself, he delicately sensitive life. He felt pledged life one it. Its forms therefore open seem familiar first. He knew instinctively went regions life differing his own--knew, without knowing how, animals thinking feeling; able interpret motions, even sudden changes behaviour. There one dangerous animal place--a bull, farmer often said he must part him, he would death somebody. One morning he struck terror find Clare stall Nimrod. The brute chained pretty short, free enough terrible mischief: Clare stroking his nose, beast standing still bull bronze, one curved one sharp, forward-set, wicked-looking horn alarming proximity angelic face. The farmer stood dismay, still bull, afraid move. Clare looked smiled, his delicate little hand went caressing huge head. It one God's small high creatures visiting good news hope one his big low creatures--a little brother Jesus Christ bringing taste his father's kingdom his great dull bull brother. The farmer called him. The boy came once. Mr. Goodenough told he must go near bull; he fierce dangerous. Clare informed he bull friends long time; prove ran back, farmer could lay hold him, perched animal's shoulders. The bull went eating grass manger him, took little heed boy fly lighted him, neither tickled stung him. By degrees he grew familiar goings farm, drew nearer true relation earth nourishes all. Where soil heavy, ploughman would set back near horse, he would ride triumph music ploughman's whistle behind. His pomp destroyer rides trampling, pomp saviour drawing forth life earth. In summer hayfield knew him, autumn harvest-field, busily he gathered earth gave, strength, sense wide life large relations. The mould, say grass-blades daisies, dear him. He sympathetic daisies ploughed even Burns, he strong feeling went somewhere, better going; way sky fell upon them. All people farm, people village, every one parish knew boy his story. From his gentleness lovingkindness live things, said he half-witted; others said he saw ghosts. The boys village despised, hated him, he unlike them. They called girl tormented he caressed. At he would smile, durst lay hands him. The days long boyhood, Clare could many things one. There morning, forenoon, long afternoon evening! He could help farm; he could play ever many animals; he could learn his lessons, happily heavy; he could read book he pleased his father's library, _Paradise Lost_ his favourite; he could nurse little Maly. He time he companion his age, one he wanted go school-hours. His father still his chief human companion, neither grew tired other. The remarkable thing child calm gentle greatness his heart. You often find children fond one two people, who, perhaps, evil return, want keep themselves, reproach loving others. Many persons count sign depth child he loves one two. I doubt greatly. I think child loves life love right well, love deeply strongly tenderly lives come nearest him. Low nurses small-hearted mothers dwarf pervert children, worst keep big hearts like God. Clare teaching this. He lost his father mother, many given love; he helped wait patiently till he found again. God keeping somewhere, keeping here. The good born world is, may learn love. I think Clare enviable boys, he loved one his age I heard of. There people--oh, silly people are!--though may sometimes pleasing--who always wanting people love them. They think much themselves, want think more; know people love makes able think themselves. They even think loving fond loved! You might soon say man loves money he generous; he loves gather, therefore he knows scatter; he likes read story, therefore he write one. Such lovers selfish deeper way, blame selfish people; for, loving loved, ought better know evil thing love; mean thing accept willing give. Even love love us, is, Lord taught us, pinched sneaking way loving. Clare never thought loved. He busy loving, many love, think himself. He contemptible little wretch say, “What fine boy I am, make everybody love me!” If he capable that, many would loved him; would got tired loving thing love again. Only great lovers like God able that, help God make love grow. But little truth love wisdom it. Clare's father mother wise, could make Clare wise. Also animals, though aware it, much save spoiled humans boy loved them. For Clare's charity began home. Those love people love people. Those love children never love animals right. Here I set strange thing befell Clare, caused sore heart, making feel like traitor whole animal race, influencing his life ever. I first puzzled account thing without attributing imagination animals--or them--than I prepared do; probably main factor heart-disease. He seen men go shooting, never accompanied killers. I quite understand how, story, he came even imitate using gun. There nothing belonged killing; I could say myself, man I know except Clare Skymer. He bottom garden one afternoon, nothing low hedge came field long grass. He his hand stick worn-out umbrella. Suddenly half-grown rabbit rose grass him, bolted. From sheer unconscious imitation, I believe, he raised stick his shoulder, said _Bang_. The rabbit gave great bound air, fell, lay motionless. With far feelings sportsman, Clare ran, got hedge, approached rabbit trembling. He could think nothing creature playing trick. Yet he frightened. Only could he hurt him! “I dare say little one knows me,” he said himself, “and wanted give start! He could not tell start would be, he would not done it.” When he drew near, however, “the little one” not, he hoped expected, jump run again. With sinking heart Clare went close up, looked it. It lay stretched out, motionless. With death his bosom he stooped tenderly lifted it. The rabbit stone-dead! The poor boy gazed it, pressed tenderly his heart, went find his mother. The tears kept pouring his face, he uttered cry till he came her. Then low groaning howl burst him; he laid dead thing her lap, threw floor her feet abandonment self-accusation despair. It long he able give her intelligible account taken place. She asked he found dead. In answer he could shake his head, head-shake whole tragedy it. Then she examined “the little one,” could find mark wound upon it. When length she learned case was, she tried comfort him, insisting he blame, he mean kill little one. He would hearken her loving sophistry. “No, mother!” he said his sobs; “I would not blamed myself, though I sorry, I killed accident--if I stepped upon him, anything kind; I meant frighten him! I looked bad him! I made think I enemy, going kill him! I shammed bad--and real bad.” He stopped wailful howl. “Perhaps he knew me,” he resumed, “and could not understand it. It much worse I shot him. He would not known till he dead. But die terror horrible. Oh, did not I think I doing?” “Nobody could thought thing happening.” “No; I ought thought, mother, I doing. I trying frighten him! I must cruel mood. Why did not I think love little one I saw him, instead thinking death him? I shall never look rabbit face again! My heart must grown black, mother!” “I do not believe another rabbit England would die because,” persisted his mother thoughtfully. “Then superior rabbit he must been!” said Clare. “To think I pulled roof his church upon him!” He burst torrent tears, ran his room. There his mother thought better leave undisturbed. She wisely judged mind sensibility alone capable finding comfort fit need. Such comfort he doubtless find, time his mother called tea, calmness taken place agony his countenance. His mother asked questions, she well her husband feared possible encouragement self-consciousness. I imagine boy reflected things could go wrong nobody could set right. I imagine he thought that, he done rabbit wrong, he never moment end his life doubted he had, he head heads heart hearts, would contrive let tell rabbit he sorry, would give something rabbit would make his cruelty him. He say his mother, neither alluded matter, he sure rabbit forgiven him. “Little ones _so_ forgiving, know, mother!” he added. Is wonder friend Clare Skymer sportsman? Chapter VIII. Clare his human brothers Another anecdote him, furtherance story it, I must yet tell. One cold day stormy March, wind wildly blowing broken clouds across heavens, rain, sleet, shivering blades young corn, whose tender green tinging dark brown earth. The fields dark wintry, heartless cold; shining repentant tears; one moment refusing comforted, next reviving hope sense new life. Clare hovering plough. Suddenly he spied, mound field, little procession passing along highway. Those front carried something shoulders must heavy, took six carry it. He knew coffin, his home churchyard, funeral unfamiliar sight. Behind one man walked alone. For moment Clare watched him, saw his bowed head heavy pace. His heart filled perennial fount pity, God him. He ran hill across next field, making spot distance ahead procession. As passed him, he joined chief mourner, went plodding his arms hanging his sides. Creeping close him, he slid his little soft hand great horny hand peasant. Instinctively big hand closed upon small one, weather-beaten face man fifty looked boy. Not word said them. They walked on, hand hand. Neither ever seen other. The man following his wife his one child grave. “Nothing almost sees miracles misery,” says Kent _King Lear_. Because man miserable, he saw miracle miracle, something good. The thing true precious, yea, message heaven. Those deep, upturned, silent eyes; profound, divine sympathy shone them; grasp tiny hand upon his large fingers, made heart man, happened catholic, imagine, moments believe, he held hand infant Saviour. The cloud lifted his heart brain, return he came understand _the_ lamb God, another lamb fold. When walked two miles, boy began fear he might intruding, would taken his hand other, man held tight, stooping whispered far now. The child, who, without knowing it, taken man protection his love, yielded once, went grave, joined service, saw grave filled. They went come. Not word spoken. The man wept little then, drew back his brown hand across his eyes, pressed little closer hand he held. At gate parsonage boy took his leave. He said would wondering become him, he would gone farther. The man released without word. His mother uneasy him, he told her was, she said he done right. “Yes,” returned boy; “I belong myself.” The mother knew he thinking grave. One anecdote I give, serving introduce narrative following chapter, helping show character boy. He unlike boys, one must know he may him, he would understand him. Never yet, strange assertion must seem, boy shown anger. His father little troubled fact, fearing absence resentment might indicate moral indifference, or, not, might yet render incapable coping world. He brought public school, not, his experience life, come see, readers story see, long time see, lies nobility, dignity evil retort kind; evil evil returned much given; shining thing good--and shining, good evil. One day coarse boy village gave sharp blow face. It forced water his eyes blood his nose. He wiping away his handkerchief, kindly girl stopped said him-- “Never mind; do not cry.” “Oh, no!” answered Clare; “it is water, it is crying. It would cowardly cry.” “That is brave boy! You will give back one days.” “No,” he returned, “I shall I could not.” “Why?” “Because hurts so. My nose feels broken. I know it is broken, feels like it.” The girl, well boys stood around him, burst laughter. They saw logic his reasoning. Clare's divine reasoning comes loving neighbour; earthly reasoning came loving themselves. They see Clare another boy another himself; he carrying design Father men, his creatures come together one, push away. The next time he met boy struck him, far he resentment fear misunderstood, he offered rosy-cheeked apple his mother given he left school. The boy tyrant sneak together--a combination seen sometimes working man set his fellows, rich man grown poor, bent upon making money again. The boy took apple, never doubted Clare gave curry favour, ate grinning, threw core his face. Clare turned away sigh, betook his handkerchief again, The boy burst guffaw hideous laughter. Chapter IX. Clare defender. This enemy trouble, less, every decent person neighbourhood. It well his mother widow, she powerless restrain, father would encouraged. He big, idle, sneering, insolent lad--such two sort, would made village uninhabitable. It peaceable vicar could keep his hands him. One day, little Mary five years old, Clare her walk. They alone narrow lane, far farm Clare much home. To his consternation, he his sister charge, lane, meeting them, came village tyrant. He strolled his hands his pockets, barred way. But while, his eye chiefly Clare, he “straddled” like Apollyon, “quite whole breadth way,” Mary slipped past him. The young brute darted child. Clare put his head, he seen rams do, Simpson, ill deserved name generous Jewish Hercules, point laying hold her, caught flank, butted ditch, fell top him. “Run, Maly!” he cried; “I will moment.” “Will you, little devil!” cried bully; taking throat, he could utter even gurgle, got began beat unmercifully. But sounds conflict reached ears bull Nimrod, feeding within hedge. He recognized Clare's voice, perhaps knew he trouble; I inclined think pure bull-love row would alone sent tearing quarter whence tyrant's brutal bellowing still came. There, looking hedge, he saw his friend clutches enemy his own, Simpson never lost chance teasing Nimrod he could safety. Over he came short roar crash. Looking up, bully saw bigger bully himself, his head horns level, retreating step two preparation running him. Simpson shoved helpless Clare toward enemy fled. Clare fell. Nimrod jumped his prostrate friend tore Simpson. Clare got would followed protect his enemy, he must first see his sister safe. He ran her cottage hard by, handed her woman door it, turning pursued Simpson bull. Nimrod overtook his enemy act scrambling five-barred gate. Simpson saw head bull coming upon like bows Dutchman upon fishing-boat, and, paralyzed terror, could move inch further. Crash gate came horns Nimrod, weight speed his body behind them. Away went gate field, away went Simpson bull it, latter nearly breaking his neck, his horns entangled bars, one diagonal bar. Simpson's right leg jammed betwixt gate head horns bull. He roared, his roars maddened Nimrod, furious already he could get his horns clear. Shake pull he might, gate stuck them; Simpson fared little better bull's quarrel moment gate, leg it. Clare seen catastrophe, know become pursuer pursued, he reached gap gate been. He saw odd struggle going on, ran aid his foe, terror might already befallen him. The moment he laid hold one animal's horns, infuriated Nimrod his helpless entanglement, he knew was, quiet; Clare always took horn first he went him. Without moment's demur he yielded small hands pushed pulled his head way got clear gate. But let go. Clare proceeded take home, Nimrod made objection. Simpson lay groaning. When Clare returned, his enemy still. He got clear gate, seemed much pain, he lay tearing grass sod handfuls. When Clare stooped ask he him, he struck backhanded blow face knocked over. Clare got ran. “Coward!” cried Simpson; “to leave man broken leg get home himself!” “I am going find one strong enough help you,” said Clare. But Simpson, his evil nature, imagined he going let bull field again, fell praying leave him. Clare knew, however, that, his leg broken, he could get home, neither could he get home himself; he made haste tell people farm, Simpson lay terror bull till help came. From hour he hated Clare, attributing ill he brought himself. But he mischief while. The trouble fell his mother--who deserved it, she would believe ill him, he _hers_. One good thing affair was, bully crippled life, could less harm. It great joy Mr. Person learn Clare defended his sister. Clergyman he was, knowing Jesus Christ would never returned blow, spirit Lord saved world, he uneasy his adopted child behaved like Jesus. That man made care return blow, never occurred Mr. Porson possible. It therefore immeasurable relief his feelings Englishman, find boy far destitute pluck, defence his sister he attacked fellow twice his size. “Were not afraid big rascal?” he said. “No, papa,” answered boy. “Ought I been?” He put his hand his forehead, trying understand. His father found he something think about. There certain quiescence Clare, ill describe, impossible explain, less manifest. Like infant, he never showed surprise anything. Whatever came he received, questioning nothing, marvelling nothing, disputing nothing. What he told he went do, never even momentary show disinclination, leaving book game readiness eagerness. He would deftly required him, return his place, countenance calm sweet moon highest heaven. He seldom offered caress except little Mary; yet would choose, anything else, place his mother's knee. The moment she, his father her absence, entered room sat down, he would rise, take his stool, set near he thought he might. When caressed he never turned away, looked he would rather let alone; time he received caress quietly, little response, often, his heavenly look drawn heart mother, spinster motherly heart, he left ache spirit he would gone world's end comfort. He never sought love--otherwise getting near loved. When anything given him, he would look smile, he seldom showed much pleasure, went beyond regulation thanks. But moment little Mary by, he curious way catching her presenting her giver. Whether shape his thanks took, whether Mary incorporate gratitude, whether he meant imply she fitter shower favour, hard say. His mother observed, her mind put two things together, he seem prize much mere possession. He looked pleased new suit clothes, one remarked his care them, he would answer, “I must not spoil what is papa mamma's!” He made hoard kind. He hoard marbles till he hundred; discovered certain boy village counted half-witted--as indeed Clare many. When he learned boy first accused stealing them--for one would believe another boy given him--and robbed boys, ground he know play them, Clare saw foolish hoard another himself. He favourite beyond knew well. Many saw church, village, take him. His still regard repelled them. In Naples would said he evil eye. I think people vague sense rebuke his presence. Even his mother, passionately loving her foundling, aware film she could quite see him, beyond something she could get at, Clare knew nothing separation. He seemed altogether close his mother, aware nothing part them. The thing was, Clare yet flower. His soul white half-blown bud, knowing half-blown. It basked glory warm sun, underside flower-leaves; opened heart, sun-side petals, love immerged. He received love matter course, loved matter course. But cruel Simpson he would known could way things. He yet know one must love mean love, must bask warmth love, know love, comes from--love fountain whence flows. Chapter X. The black aunt. Clare yet his tenth year unhealthy summer came. The sun bright warm summers, flowers field garden appeared usual hour arrived wake look abroad; children men fare well children earth. A peculiar form fever showed village. It fatal, yet many affected long unable work. There consequently much distress beyond suffering fever itself. The parson his wife went morning night among cottagers, helping everybody needed help. They private fortune, small blanket benefice spread freely many could stretched cover, depriving good part food accustomed, several degrees necessary warmth. When last strength parson gave way, fever laid hold him, he without many comforts his wife would gladly got him. They rather humble origin, one relative well-to-do, sister Mrs. Porson, married rich common man. From her could ask help. She never sent little present, fiercely indignant adopting Clare. Neither complained, though Mrs. Person, whose strength much spent, could help weeping sometimes she alone free weep. They knew Lord live luxury, secret gladness nestled hearts allowed suffer little sake flock he given charge. The children course share general gloom, trouble much. For Clare, he easily troubled anything. Always ready help, he much realize suffering was; he Mary look after, labour pleasure, work play pay one. His mother ease concerning her child she knew her Clare's charge, free attend her husband. She often said ever paid good themselves, she her husband vastly overpaid taking child shuddering arms earthquake. But John Porson's hour come. He must leave wife children parish, go sent him. If one think hard he fare his duty, let silent till he learn parson thought matter he got home. People talk death gosling might life chips egg. Take way lamentation, shall find endless injustice get every morning go bed every night. Mrs. Porson wept, never thought herself ill-used. And she low enough indulge self-pity, would thrown away, she time wonder she live rear her children, she sent for. In world she one mothers little faith trust God children, her husband, she would trust God less. Clare garden Sarah told she dead. He stood still moment, looked up, blue. Why he looked up, he could told; ever since terrible morning vague burning memory never passed, great dome he gazing, burst fell, he way every standing still looking up. His face white. Two slow tears gathered, rolled over, dried upon his face. He turned Mary, lifted her his arms, and, carrying her garden, told her his strange version happened his childhood. Then he told her her papa mamma gone look his papa mamma--“somewhere dome,” he said. When wanted take Mary see left her mother, boy contrived prevent them. From morning till night he never lost sight child. One cold noon October, clouds miles deep front sun, rain falling thick yellow leaves, paths miry, two children sat kitchen fire. Sarah cooking mid-day meal, come her pocket. She servant either known house, she would leave one take charge them. The neighbours, dreading infection, come near them. Clare sat little stool Mary his knees, nestling his bosom; he felt dreary, he saw love-firmament him; cloud death hid it. With sudden jingle rattle, drove rickety post-chaise door parsonage. Out it, kitchen, came stalking tall middle-aged woman, long black cloak, black bonnet, black gloves, face stern peevish. “I late Mrs. Porson's sister,” she said, stood. Sarah courtesied waited. Clare rose, Mary his arms. “This little Maly, madam,” he said, offering her child. “Set her down, let see her,” she answered. Clare obeyed. Mary put her finger her mouth, began cry. She like look black aunt, used harsh voice. “Tut! tut!” said black aunt. “Crying already! That never do! Show her things.” Sarah felt stunned. This worse death! “If mistress taken her!” she said herself. Mary's things--they many--were soon packed. Within hour she borne off, shrieking, struggling, calling Clay. The black aunt, however,--as black aunt Clare always thought her--cared nothing her resistance; Clare, her first cry rushing rescue, ready battle her, seized held back Farmer Goodenough. Sarah sent him, he come--just time frustrate Clare's valour. The carriage yet sight, Farmer Goodenough began repent he come: his presence acknowledgment responsibility! Something must done foundling! There nobody claim him, nobody wanted him! He always liked boy, he want him! His wife fond boy, boy, want him! He said her Clare could left starve, she answered, “Why not?”! What done him? Nobody knew--any Clare himself. But us knows going done him? Clare nobody's business. English farmers French proverbial generosity; Farmer Goodenough, bad type his class, wife whose thoughts pence farthings dominated. She one recoiled repelled--one whose skin shrinks skin kind, specially apt take unaccountable dislikes--a pitiable human animal leprous sort. She “never took foundling,” she said. To neither father mother, she counted disreputable. But I believe main source her dislike Clare feeling undefined reproof atmosphere boy's presence, his nature different hers. What urged toward his fellow-creatures, made her draw back him. In truth she hated boy. The look made her sick, she said. It certain respect parson, certain fear her husband, who, seldom angry, yet capable fury, prevented her driving child, “with his dish-clout face,” premises, whenever she saw door window. It wonder farmer he his wits' end know what, churchwarden, guardian poor, friend late vicar--as friendly also boy himself, he bound do. “Where _you_ going?” he asked Sarah. “Where Lord wills,” answered old woman. Her ark gone pieces, she hardly cared became her. “We have got look ourselves!” said farmer. “Parson used say One took hands!” replied Sarah. “Yes, yes,” assented Mr. Goodenough, fidgeting little; “but Almighty helps helps themselves, that is sound doctrine. You really must something, Sarah! We cannot parish, know!” “I beg pardon, sir, child provided for, turn us parsonage, I leave place.” “The furniture advertised sale. You will nothing bare walls!” “We will manage keep warm!--Shall not we, Clare?” “I try keep warm, Sarah,” responded boy sadly. “But new parson soon here. Our souls must cared for!” “Is Lord's child came heaven earthquake turned cold fear souls big men perish?” “Something must done it!” said farmer. “What it is I cannot tell! It is business mine way!” “That is priest, Levite, farmer says!” returned Sarah. “Will not ask Mr. Goodenough stay dinner?” said Clare. He went farmer, his perplexity seated himself, laid his arm his shoulder. “No, I cannot,” answered Sarah. “He would eat have, enough!” “Now Maly gone,” returned Clare, “I would rather dinner.” The farmer's old feeling boy, dread left his hands time dulled, came back. “Get his dinner, Sarah,” he said. “I have something see village. By time I come back, he will ready go me, perhaps.” “God bless you, sir!” cried Sarah. “You meant time, an' I behavin' like brute!” The farmer like taken sharply. He promised nothing! But he nearly made his mind that, friend late parson, he could scarcely less give shelter child he found another refuge. True, he parson's child, he loved his own! He would make boy useful, shut his wife's mouth! There many things Clare could place! Chapter XI. Clare farm. When Mr. Goodenough appeared house-door boy, his wife's face expressed her tongue dared utter without heating furnace behind it. But Clare never saw he unwelcome. He begun note outward visible signs regard his species; his observation confined animals, whose every motion look he gave heed. But he hardly aware watching even them: his love made natural watch, easy understand them! He drawn study Mrs. Goodenough, read her indications; he content hear she said. True her nature, Mrs. Goodenough, seeing she could get rid boy, her endeavour make pay his keep. Nominally he continued attend village school, old master his best him; but, oftener not, she interposed prevent his going, turned use house, dairy, poultry-yard. His new mode life occasioned sense hardship. I mean his patient acceptance everything came; he long accustomed ways farm, phases life work yard field, nothing came strange him--except stick he put to, next time read. Many boys found much amusement that, find irksome moment required them: Clare mean sort; he gentleman. Happily he put work beyond his strength. At first, time, he creatures immediately care “the mistress,” whence his acquaintance poultry pigs, pigeons calves--and specially delicate hurt--with ways thinking carriage conduct, rapidly increased. By by, however, already almost ceased attend school, farmer, requiring passing help boy could give, took his wife--not without complaint her part, neither without sense relief, would part again. He quick required, intelligent catch meaning always thoroughly expressed, cheerful, willing, he pleasure Mr. Goodenough--and less pleasure farmer dwelt Mr. Goodenough, seemed men him; for, instead expense, he found saving. It much pleasant Clare his master his mistress, he fared worse house. The woman's dislike boy must find outlet; as, instead flowing day long, pent greater part it, stronger issued he came home his meals. I defile page record modes she vented her spite. It sought times minuteness indulgence, next impossible one perceive embodiments except boy himself. He came contact larger animals place; comfort he derived greater people would readily perhaps willingly believe. He kept his relations Nimrod, bull, never breach friendship them. The people farm unfrequently sought his influence animal, times dared hardly approach him. Clare even made useful--got little work then. But his main interest lay horses. He time known rather less creatures place; he give his chief attention them, laying love foundation knowledge afterward stood stead he came dwell time among certain eastern tribes whose horses chief gladness care. He used, alone them, talk one friends he lost--his father mother Maly Sarah--and mind listened. He would even tell sometimes his father mother--how whole sky full angels fell upon took away. But he said his sister. For her he mourned rest. Her screams black aunt carried her away, would sometimes come back verisimilitude nearness, that, forgetting everything him, he would start run her. He felt somehow well others, Maly always needed _him_, ever last days companionship. He wept nobody Maly. In night he would wake suddenly, thinking he heard her crying him. Then he would get bed, creep stable, go Jonathan, pour his low-voiced complaint. Jonathan biggest oldest horse farm. How much he thought understood he told them, I cannot say. He never silly; cannot sure, may yet reason hope. He believed knew he trouble, sympathized him, would gladly relieved his pain. I suspect animals know something significance tears. More animals she would tears people think. For dogs, bless them, everywhere, boy known time immemorial. In village, Clare's old admirers began remark he longer “looked little gentleman.” This caused chiefly state his clothes. They fit work he put, within weeks shabby. Besides, he growing rapidly, he his garments evident process parting company. Accustomed mother's attentions, he never thought his clothes except take care her sake; he tried mend them, soon found his labour little use. He wages buy anything with. His clothes his health his education nothing Mrs. Goodenough. It concern whether he looked decent not. What right he look decent? It enough she fed him! The shabbiness beggarly creature consolation her. But Clare's toil open air, his constant willing association animals, begun give bucolic appearance. He grew trifle browner, showed freckle. His health splendid. Nothing seemed hurt him. Hardship wholesome him. To eyes hated him, grudged hire mere food he grew, he seemed every day enlarge visibly. Already he gave promise becoming man ordinary strength vigour. Possibly animals gave something. What may his outlook hope time, shall tell! He never grumbled, never showed sign pain unwillingness, gave his mistress reason fault-finding. She found hard even discover pretext. She seemed always ready strike him, probably afraid without provocation her husband would count sufficient. Clare never showed discomfort, never even sighed except he alone. Chequered his life been, ever he looked forward fresh change, far possibility slow current events. But he constantly possessed large dim sense something lay beyond, waiting him; something toward tide things certainty drifting him, he nothing wait. He see things given preparation whatever, dim under-world future, might preparing him; he feel he must his work. He think much duty. He actively inclined, strong feeling thing ought done; thoroughly loyal one seemed right him. In blind, enduring, vaguely hopeful way, he went on--sustained, none less certainly he know it, fountain his life. When winter came, his sufferings, cared he been, accustomed warmth softness, must times considerable. In day his work protection, night house cold. He had, however, plenty eat, ailment, greatly pitied. Chapter XII. Clare becomes guardian poor. Simpson, bully Clare's childhood, went limping crutch, permanently lame, full hatred toward innocent occasion injury he brought upon himself. Ever since his recovery, he had, loitering idleness, watched boy, waylay catch unawares. Not Clare went farm, however, he succeed; difficult escape him, long he laid actual hold his prey. But he grew cunning, contrived last, creeping along hedges lying ambush like snake, get his hands upon him. Then poor boy fared ill. He went home bleeding torn. The righteous churchwarden rebuked severity fighting. His mistress told she glad he met one give he deserved, she could hardly keep her hands him. He stared her wondering eyes, said nothing. She turned them: devil her could look eyes angel him. The next time he fell snare his enemy, he managed conceal befallen him. After he wide awake caught. There village child nobody heeded. He far destitute Clare, much liberty. He lived wretched old woman called her grandson: whether he nobody cared. She made her livelihood letting beds, cottage rather hovel seemed her own, wayfarers, mostly tramps, without trades. The child thus thrown worst company, learned many sorts wickedness. He already thief, small proficiency his art. Though village-bred, he could pick pocket sensitive clown's. Small deft, he never stood magistrate. He miserable creature, bare-footed bare-legged; eight years age, stunted first glance he looked less six--with keen ferret eyes red rims, red hair, pasty, freckled complexion, generally unhealthy look; marks all, Clare conceived pitiful sympathy him. Their acquaintance began thus:-- One day, his father's last illness, he happened pass door grandmother's hovel crone administering Tommy severe punishment piece thick rope: she sharp enough catch stealing herself. Clare heard his cries. The door partly open, he ran in, gave assistance managed bolt together hut. A friendship, long almost silent one, thus initiated them. Tommy--Clare never knew his name, boy himself--would watch sight day long, instinct, experience, never approach one him. He careful compromise him. The instant momentary _tête-à-tête_ possible, he would rush up, offer something he found stolen, hurry away again. That he thief Clare remotest suspicion. He never offered anything suggest theft. By came knowledge Clare's enemy friendship them, discovery wrought direness both. One day Simpson saw Clare coming, Tommy watching him. He laid hold Tommy, began cuffing pulling his hair, make scream, thinking thus get hold Clare. But notwithstanding lesson he received, rascal yet adequate notion boy's capacity action another concerned. He flew rescue, caught crutch Simpson dropped, laid across his back vigour. The fellow let Tommy go turned Clare, went backward, brandishing crutch. “Run, Tommy,” he cried. Tommy retreated steps. “Run yourself,” he counselled, reached safe distance. “Take his third leg you.” Clare saw advice good, ran. But next moment reflection showed helplessness his enemy. He turned, saw hobbling evident pain discomfiture, he went meet him, politely gave his crutch. He might thrown gone on, he horror rudeness, handed bow. Just he regained his perpendicular, crutch descended his head, laid flat ground. There tyrant belaboured him. Tommy stood regarded proceeding. “The cove's older an' bigger an' pluckier me,” he said himself; “but he is ass. He will come grief unless he is looked after. He will hanged else. He do not know dodge. I will take charge!” When he saw Clare free, event he contributed nothing, he turned ran home. Simpson redoubled his persecution Clare, persecuted Tommy Clare. He lurked Tommy now, he caught him, tormented choice tortures. In word, he made his life miserable. After every mischance Tommy would hurry farm, lie hope sight Clare, possibly chance speaking him. His repute bad he dared show himself. Hot tears would come Clare's eyes he listened always unembellished tale Tommy's sufferings hands Simpson; he never thought revenge, protection escape boy. It comforted believe he growing, would soon match oppressor. Whether time he felt great interest life, recognized personal advantage growing, I doubt. But he friendship animals; surprising creatures maker thinks worth making keeping alive, yield consolation one understands them, even fill mild joy pauses labour irksome life. Then new day old friend boy. Each time sun rose, new hope rose his heart. He came every morning fresh home, fresh promise. The boy read promise his great shining, believed it; gazed rejoiced, turned his work. But hour arrived his mistress could bear his presence longer. Some petty loss, I imagine, befallen her. Nothing touched her like loss money--the love dread passion love drink, ruinous finer elements nature. It like tearing her heart Mrs. Goodenough lose shilling. Her self-command forsook her, perhaps, moment vexation; anyhow, she opened sluices her hate, overwhelmed presence her husband. The farmer knew she unfair, knew orphan good boy diligent, knew nothing antipathy his wife. But, annoyed her injustice, he powerless change her heart. Since boy came live them, he pleasure his wife's society. She always moody dissatisfied, since unbearable. Constantly irritated her Clare, he begun regard destroyer his peace, feel grudge him. He sat smouldering bodiless rage, said nothing. Clare silent,--for could he say? Where wisdom answer hatred? He carried his friend Jonathan heart heavy perplexed. “Why she hate so, Jonathan?” he murmured. The big horse kissed his head over, made answer. Chapter XIII. Clare vagabond. The next morning Clare happened something altogether farmer's mind. It matter consequence--only cleaning side one cow-houses first usually cleaned last. He gave box ear made stagger, stand bewildered. “What mean staring way?” cried farmer, annoyed seeking justification his eyes. “Am I box ears I choose?” And he gave another blow. Then first dawned Clare he wanted, he good anybody. He threw his scraper, ran cow-house; ran straight farm lane, lane high road. Buffets hand his friend, sudden sense loneliness caused, moment bereft Clare purpose. It his legs run away him, he unconsciously submitted abduction. At mouth lane, opened high road, he ran Tommy turning corner, eager find him. The eyes small human monkey swollen weeping; his nose bleeding, size shape scarce recognizable nose. At sight, consciousness his protectorate awoke Clare, he stopped, unable speak, unable listen. Tommy blubbered confused, half-inarticulate something “granny devil,” killed him. “What I do?” said Clare, his heart sinking sense help him. Tommy ready answer question. He hatching vengeance way. Eagerly came his proposition--that should, turn, lie ambush Simpson, knock his crutch him. That done, Clare belabour it, he ran like wind set his grandmother's house fire. “She will drunk bed, an' she will burned death!” cried Tommy. “Then we will mizzle!” “But would hurt badly, Tommy!” said Clare, unfolding reality thing foolish child. “Well! right! worse better! 'Are not hurt us?” rejoined Tommy. “That is know it is nice!” answered Clare. “If set going, are not keep going!” “Then they will ever,” cried Tommy, “an' I am sick it! I will _kill_ granny! I swear I will, I am hanged it! She is said hundred times she would pull legs I hanged; _she_ will not hanging!” “Why should not run first?” said Clare. “Then would not want hang you!” “Then I should not nobody!” replied Tommy, whimpering. “I thought Nobody good granny!” said Clare. “A big bilin' better!” answered Tommy bitterly. “I was not meanin' granny--nor yet stumpin' Simpson.” “I do not know you are driving at,” said Clare. Tommy burst tears. “Are not one I got, down?” he cried. Tommy little bit heart--not much, enough chance growing. If ever creature less that, he human. I think he could even ape. Some people parson used think Clare heart, Mrs. Goodenough sure it. He spark gratitude, she said. But opinion Clare's affection took shape deeds far words. Never judges neighbours mistaken. The chief difference Clare's history others was, his began unusual end. Clare began loving everybody; people take long time grow that. Hence, whom, brought nearest them, he loved specially, he loved without outbreak show often found persons love few, whose love defiled partisanship. He loved quietly constantly, fashion active undemonstrative. He always glad near he specially loved; beyond that, signs his love practical--it came ministration, things them. There who, without loving, desire loved, love themselves; worth least precious themselves. But Clare never thought love others him--from heartlessness, he think himself--had never done so, least, moment he fled farm new agony his heart nobody wanted him, everybody would happier without him. Happy he think hour he becomes conscious bliss loved. For must ought happy moment one learns another human creature loves him; grateful love deeply selfish. Clare always loved, thought one loving him, loved one. “Well,” rejoined Clare, struggling his misery, “are not I going myself?” “You going!--That is chaff!” “'Tain't chaff. I am way.” “What! Going hook it? Oh golly! lark! Will not Farmer Goodenough look blue!” “He will think well rid me,” returned Clare sigh. “But there is time talk. If you are going, Tommy, come along.” He turned go. “Where to?” asked Tommy, following. “I do not know. Anywhere away,” answered Clare, quickening his pace. In spite his swollen visage, Tommy's eyes grew wider. “You 'are not cribbed nothing?” he said. “I do not know mean.” “You 'are not stole something?” interpreted Tommy. Clare stopped, first time his part, lifted his hand strike. It dropped immediately his side. “No, poor Tommy,” he said. “I do not steal.” “Thought did not! What running away then?” “Because do not want me.” “Lord! do?” “Work.” Tommy held his tongue: he knew better way that! If work road eating, things would go badly _him_! But he thought he knew thing two, would take his chance! There degrees hunger bad thrashings he got, his granny's hands rope might fall would; cripple Simpson cared make squeal satisfactorily. But work worse all! He would go Clare, work! Not he! Clare kept silence, never turning his head--out untried, unknown, mysterious world, lay around one spot he knew darkness lies flame candle. They walked mile either spoke. Chapter XIV. Their first helper It lovely spring morning. The sun thirty degrees horizon, shining liquid radiance, he already drawn shining dew morning, though lay yet grasses roadside, turning gem-plants. Every sort gem sparkled feathery beady tops, long slender blades. At first cottages passed, women beginning day's work, sweeping clean floors door-steps. Clare noted flowers garden, windows brightest, children cleanest. “The flowers come make things nice them!” he said himself. “Where flowers see dirt, turn away, will not come out.” From childhood he notion flowers crept inside stalks found window look at. Where prospect mind crept down, away door root try again. For stalks stood like watch-towers, ready go peep out. They came pond farm-house. Clare observing pity wretched Tommy's clothes were; he looked pond he saw his shabbiness worse Tommy's downright miserableness. Nobody would leave either within reach anything worth stealing! What he wore his Sunday suit, even worth brushing! “I am 'orrid 'ungry,” said Tommy. “I 'are not swallered plug mornin', 'xcep' lump bread granny's cupboard. That is I got weltin' for. It whole half-loaf, though--an' none dry!” Clare eaten nothing, since five of the clock--at work time till farmer struck him: he quite hungry Tommy. What done? Besides pocket-handkerchief he one thing alienable. The day she taken ill, he store-room his mother, she, knowing pleasure he took scent brown Windsor-soap, made present small cake. This he kept his pocket ever since, wrapt piece rose-coloured paper, his one cherished possession: hunger deadening sorrow, time come bid farewell. His heart ached part it, Tommy he hungry! They went door house, knocked--first Clare gently, Tommy determination. It opened matron looked horizon her chin. “Please, madam,” said Clare, “will give us piece bread?--as large piece, please, spare; I give piece brown Windsor-soap.” As he ended his speech, he took farewell whiff his favourite detergent. “Soap!” retorted dame. “Who wants soap! Where get it? Stole it, I do not doubt! Show here.” She took her hand, held her nose. “Who gave you?” “My mother,” answered Clare. “Where is mother?” Clare pointed upward. “Eh? Oh--hanged! I thought, so!” She threw soap yard, closed door. Clare darted his property, pounced upon it, restored lovingly his pocket. As leaving yard disconsolate, saw cart full turnips. Tommy turned made it. “Do not, Tommy,” cried Clare. “Why not? I am hungry,” answered Tommy, “an' see it is use astin'!” He flew cart, Clare caught held him. “They are not ours, Tommy,” he said. “Then do not take one?” retorted Tommy. “That is should not.” “It is should, 'ud yours.” “To take would not make ours, Tommy.” “Would not it, though? I believe I would eaten it, would mine--rather!” “No, would not. Think stomach was not yours! No, must pay it. Perhaps would take soap turnip. I believe it is worth two turnips.” He spied man she would, ran him, made offer soap turnip apiece. “I do not want soap,” answered man, “an' I do not recommend cold turmits mornin'. But take one like, clear out. The master's cart-whip 'ill ears moment he sees you!” “Are not master, sir?” “No, I are not.” “Then turnips are not yours?” said Clare, looking hungry, regretful eyes, he could eaten raw potato. “You are deal impudent hungry!” said man, making blow his open hand, Clare dodged. “Be you, I will set dog you.” “I am sorry,” said Clare. “I mean offend you.” “Clear out, I say. Double trot!” Hungry boys were, must trudge! No bread, turnip them! Nothing trudge, trudge till dropped! When gone five miles further, sat down, common consent, roadside; Tommy, used crying, began cry. Clare seek stop him, instinct told must relief. By working-man came along road. Clare hesitated, Tommy's crying urged him. He rose stood ready accost him. As soon he came up, however, man stopped himself. He questioned Clare listened his story, counselled boys go back. “I am wanted, sir,” said Clare. “They would kill _me_,” said Tommy. “God help you, boys!” returned man. “You may telling lies, may telling truth!--A liar may hungry, somehow I grudge dinner liar!” As he spoke he untied knots blue handkerchief white spots, gave contents bread cheese, wiped his face it, put his pocket; lifted his bag tools, went his way. He lost his dinner saved his life! The dinner, man's, went good way toward satisfying them, though empty corners would far seek, anything put them. As was, started refreshed hopeful. What come might reasonably come again! Chapter XV. Their first host. As evening drew on, began settle night, new care arose mind elder boy. Where pass darkness?--how find shelter sleep? It question gave Tommy anxiety. He tramp often, one party, another his granny's lodgers, frequently slept open air, rudest covert. Tommy much imagination trouble him, his present moral condition possibly better without it; inexperienced Clare something fearful night come close him. Sleep doors he never thought of. To lie stars looking him, nothing blue wind them, like naked soul. Doubtless would creatures about, share night him, protect awful bareness; would size room, he might see none them! It sense emptiness, lack present life dismayed him. He never seen creatures shrink from. He disliked one things creep walk fly. Before long he come know dislike least one sort; sea held creatures years made shudder; yet, even rats, terrible many, terror Clare. It Nothing he feared. My reader may say, “But one taught God?” Yes, he heard God, Jesus Christ; heard great deal them. But always seemed persons long way off. He knew, thought he knew, God everywhere, he never felt his presence reality. He seemed place Clare's eyes ever fell. He never thought, “God here.” Perhaps sparrows knew God he then. When he looked night always seemed vacant, therefore horrid, he took empty looked. And God there, would reasonable indeed afraid; frightful notions _Nothing-at-all_. It grew dark, falling asleep walking legs, came barn-yard. Very glad creep it, search warmest place. It quiet part country, years nothing stolen anybody, people watchful many places. They went prowling about, even Tommy innocent intent, eager little warmth, much sleep could find, came length open window, crawled what, smell noises, knew stable. It dark, Clare home, felt his way about; Tommy, afraid horses, held close him. Clare's hand fell upon hind-quarters large well-fed horse. The huge animal asleep standing, touch small hand he gave low whinny. Tommy shuddered sound. “He is pleased,” said Clare, crept his near side stall. There he soon made friends him, he hesitate get among hay horse his supper. “Here, Tommy!” he cried whisper; “there is room us manger.” But Tommy stood shaking. He fancied darkness full horses' heads, would stir. Clare get again, search place suit his fancy, he found untenanted loose-box, remains litter. There Tommy coiled up, soon fast asleep. Clare returned hospitality big horse. The great nostrils snuffed he lay, boy knew horse made welcome. He dropped asleep stroking muzzle his chamber-fellow, slept night, kept warm horse's breath, near furnace his great body. In morning boys found slept long, discovered. But though promptly ejected vagabonds, without kicks cuffs, administered without restraint mercy, appearance tended move pity rather indignation. Chapter XVI. On tramp. With new day came fresh necessity breakfast, fresh interest discovery it. But breakfast thing always easiest find breakfasts abound; found morning altogether sort envied, ill could afford despise it. Passing, goal-less way, flour-mill, door half-open, caught sight heap, whether floury dust dusty flour, would hard say, seemed waiting help it. Fain still craving birds early worm, swallowed considerable portion it, choking was, met rebuke. There good food it, might fared worse. Another day's tramp thus inaugurated. How end one world knew less trampers. Before over, considerable change passed upon Clare; new era begun his history, he started grow rapidly. Hitherto, his father mother, his little sister, making life happy her; even farm, hard work, he lived much feeling he read story: he story, half dreaming, half acting it. The difference thing passed his brain pages book, arose he lay bed either awake asleep, thing he shared life motion day, much marked his consciousness. He dreamer open eyes ready hands, clearly distinguishing thought action, fancy fact. Even cold hunger he felt farm sufficed wake up; he wait removed. But he know whence his hunger satisfied, shelter had; also hunger outside him, cold his, yet he supply frustrate person Tommy, life began grow real him; and, far more, he began grow real himself, power whose part encounter necessities thus presented. He began understand things required him. He met requirements before, satisfied them, without knowing requirements. He half awake, thinking willing source motion demanded. He impulse, hardly response. Now put bodies, sent world, wake us up. We might go dreaming ages left without bodies wind could blow upon, rain could wet, sun scorch, bodies feel thirst cold hunger wounds weariness. The eternal plan beginning tell upon Clare. He process changed dreamer man. It good thing dreamer, bad thing indeed _only_ dreamer. He began see everybody world something order get food; he worked farmer his wife, fed him. He worked willingly eaten gladly, put two together. He saw men would men must work. His eyes fell upon congregation rooks field roadside. “Are _they_ working?” he thought; “or stealing? If stealing at, looks like hard work well. It cannot stealing though; made live, _how_ live do not grub? that is work! Still corn are not theirs! Perhaps it is worms take! Are worms theirs? A man die rather steal, papa said. But, stealing, crows do not know it; do not know it, are not thieves! Is it?” The instant came report gun. A crowd rooks rose cawing. One dropped lay. “He must stealing,” thought Clare, “for see comes it! Would shoot I stole? Better shot die hunger! Yes, better die hunger thief!” He read stories thieves honest boys, never seen difficulty matter. Nor he yet notion difficult thief--that is, downright honest. If anybody thinks easy, either he known much life, he never tried honest; he done like people. Clare know many boy whose heart sided honest boy story, grown dishonourable man--a man ready benefit disadvantage others; many man passes respectable disreputable world, counted far meaner thief next, going put prison. But he began see enough mean well; he must sharp, mind he about; else, hunger worrying inside him, he might thief he knew. He way discover think rightly--to side honourable reading story, different thing right, honourable, temptation upon us. Many boy he reads say, “Of course is!” time comes, sneak. Those crows set Clare thinking; well; he done thinkings taught him, he would given different turn his history. Meditation resolve, top honourable habit, brought this, that, he saw right, he it--did without hesitation, question, struggle. Every man must, would free man, would slave universe himself. Chapter XVII. The baker's cart. The sweepings mill-floor last long, time saw rising spires chimneys small county town road leading them, hungry indeed--as hungry well could without begun grow faint. The moment he saw them, Clare began revolving his mind more, many times way, he get work: Tommy course small anything, Clare must earn enough both. He could think nothing going shops, knocking house-doors, asking something do. So filled he his need work, undefined sense claim work, he never thought much must outward appearance dismayed he saw pond; never thought unwilling one would employ him, disadvantage company Tommy, every mark born thief. I know if, his tramps, Tommy town before, Clare he saw bore aspect perfect novelty, notwithstanding city-shapes floated faintest shadow, like memories old dreams, his brain. He delighted grand look place, many people many shops. His hope work became brilliant convincing. Noiselessly suddenly Tommy started his side, much occupied he he beheld he thought, he neither saw go missed gone. He became aware finding pulled toward entrance narrow lane. Tommy pulled hard Clare yielded, went lane, stopped immediately. For he saw Tommy his arm big loaf, steam newly-baked bread fragrant his nostrils. Never smoke gracious greeted incense-loving priest. Tommy tugged tugged, Clare stood stock-still. “Where get beautiful loaf, Tommy?” he asked. “Off baker's cart,” said Tommy. “Do not skeered; he never saw me! That business, an' I seed 't.” “Then stole it, Tommy?” “Yes,” grumbled Tommy, “--if that is name put upon trousers slack you have got hold they would trip up!” “Where is cart?” “In street there.” “Come along.” Clare took loaf Tommy, turned find baker's cart. Tommy's face fell, he conscious bitterness. Why he yielded sentiment--not he knew word--when he longed like fire bury his sharp teeth heavenly loaf? Love--not mention little fear--had urged carry straight Clare, his reward! He going give baker! There gratitude you! He ought known better trust _anybody_, even Clare! Nobody trusted yourself! It seem hard Tommy. They scarcely turned corner came upon cart. The baker looking way, talking one, Clare thought lay loaf say nothing it: occasion ceremony apology offence unknown. But act baker turned saw him. He sprang upon him, collared him. The baker nice look at. “I you!” he cried, shook he would shaken his head off. “It is quite mistake, sir!” Clare could get out, fierce earthquake rattled house his life. “Mistaken I? I like that!--Police!” And baker shook again. A policeman far off; he heard man call, came running. “Here is gen'leman wants honour acquaintance, Bob!” said baker. But Tommy saw that, his size, he likely get Clare he told truth. “Please, policeman,” he said, “it was not him; took loaf.” “You little liar!” shouted baker. “Did not I see his hand loaf?” “He puttin' back,” said Tommy. “I wish he would somewheres else! See he an' got it! If he would ha' let run, would not ha' nobody wiser. I _am_ sorry I did not run. Oh, I _ham_ 'ungry!” Tommy doubled up, his hands inside double. “'Ungry, you?” roared baker. “That is thieves baker's cart ought be! They ought always 'ungry--'ungry eternity, ought! An' that is what is going done  them!” “Look here!” cried pale-faced man front crowd, seemed mechanic. “There is way tellin' whether boy's speakin' truth _now_!” He caught restored loaf, halved cleverly, handed boys part. “Now, baker, what is pay?” he said, drew up, man angry reply. The boys tearing delicious bread, blind deaf them. “P'r'aps would like give _me_ charge?” pursued saviour. “Sixpence,” said man sullenly. The mechanic laid sixpence cover cart. “I ought ha' made weigh make up,” he said. “Where is scales?” “Mind business.” “I mean to. Here! I want another sixpenny loaf--but I want weighed time!” “I are not bound sell bread streets. You go shop. Them loaves reg'lar customers.” He moved his cart, crowd began disperse. The boys stood absorbed, remained his half-loaf. When he looked up, Clare saw alone. But he caught sight benefactor way off, ran him. “Oh, sir!” he said, “I hungry, I do not know whether I thanked loaf. We would nothing to-day sweepings mill.” “God bless soul!” said man. “People say there is God!” he added. “I think must be, sir, came then!” returned Clare. “How come hard-up, boy? Somebody is blame somewheres!” “There are not harm hungry, long loaf comes!” rejoined Clare. “When I get work shall right!” “That is sort!” said man. “But God, people say, he would ha' made fit gi'e job, i'stead stan'in' see me, never turn work myself!” “I will work hardest pay back sixpence,” said Clare. “Nay, nay, lad! Do not trouble that. I ha' got two three i' pocket, thank God!” “You two Gods, you, sir?” said Clare;”--one things you, one do not?” “Come, young shaver! you are much me!” said man laughing. Tommy, finished his bread, thought fit join them. He came slyly up, looking impudent he filled, his hands his pockets been. “It stole loaf, little rascal!” said workman, seeing thief every line boy. “Yes,” answered Tommy boldly, “an' I do not see harm. The baker lots, he was not 'ungry! It Clare made mull it! He is duffer do not know! He acshally took back brute! He deserved he got! The loaf mine. It was not his! _I_ stole it!” “Oh, ho! was not his! yours, it?--Why go chap like this, young gentleman?” said man, turning Clare. “I know speech 'are not brought alongside sech him!” “I go away, he came me,” answered Clare. “You would better get rid him. He will get trouble.” “I cannot get rid him,” replied Clare. “But I shall teach take is not his. He do not know better now. He is ill-used his life.” “You do not seem well used yourself,” said man. He saw Clare's clothes made boy good circumstances, though long worn, much begrimed. His face, his tone, his speech convinced made _him_, he gentle breeding. “Look here, young master,” he continued; “you right company boy. He will bring grief sure I tell you.” “I shall able bear it,” answered Clare sigh. “He will loss character you.” “I 'are not got character lose,” replied Clare. “I thought I had; nobody believe me, where is character then?” “Now you are wrong there,” returned man. “I am much, I know; I believe every word say, sorry find mistaken.” “Thank you, sir,” said Clare. “May I carry bag you?” If Clare seen passed Tommy's mind, back glistening ferret-eyes his, he would almost reconciled taking man's advice, getting rid him. Tommy saying his pal was not duffer all--he lay man's tools! Tommy never reasoned except direction cunning self-help--of fitting means intermediate ends one main object eating. It wonderful sharpener poor wits hunger is! “I guess I am abler-bodied pauper!” answered man; picking bag he dropped his feet conversed, he walked away. There many generous persons among poor among rich--a fact might help understand rich man find hard enter kingdom heaven. It hard everybody, harder rich. Men strive make money unconsciously pulling instead pushing heavy gate kingdom. “Tommy!” said Clare, tone new himself, new sense moral protection risen him, “if ever steal anything again, either I give hiding, I part company.” Tommy bored his knuckles his red eyes, began whimper. Again hard Tommy! He followed Clare, thinking supply lacking him; he clever enough himself; short, make advantageous partnership him, he furnish faculty picking unconsidered trifles. Tommy judged Clare defective intellect, quite unpractical. He mind multitude. The common-minded man always calls man thinks righteousness gain, seeks God seek make fortune, unpractical. He _will_ see essence practical lies right thing. Tommy, semi-conscious way, looked Clare supply strength innocent look, he supplied head lively fingers; Clare knocking lovely plan pieces! He well angry! But Clare stronger; Tommy knew that, Clare roused, though easy rouse him, he could would fight--not, indeed, little coward said _he_ could fight, like wild cat, like blundering hornless old cow defending her calf cur. In heart his selfishness, however, Tommy little love Clare; his love came, Tommy, source his desire food, namely, God Tommy, God Tommy lived his Clare. Whether Tommy's love Clare would one day lift beside Clare, is, make honest boy like Clare, remained seen. Finding his demonstration make impression, Tommy took his knuckles his eye-holes thrust his pocket-holes, turned his back his friend, began whistle--with lump self-pity his throat. Chapter XVIII. Beating town. They turned faces toward centre town, resumed walk, taking saw yet second instalment daily bread. What thing food! It divineness invention--the need food, food need--that makes count dinner important thing day, low creatures: nothing good turned vileness. It delight see boy good honest appetite; boy _loves_ his dinner loathsome creature. Eat heartily, boy, ready share, even hungry, could eat yourself, else man. Remember created neither hunger food; came one cares neighbours well. In strength half-loaf he eaten, place looked Clare far wonderful, his hopes earning his bread grew yet radiant. But he passed one shop another, always something prevented going in. One another look right sort, seem invite him: next might better! I dare say half-loaf, he would made trial sooner, I doubt he would succeeded sooner. He think going parson, doctor, policeman advice; he went walking staring, followed Tommy his hands his pocketless pocket-holes. Clare yet practical device, though perfect willingness, thorough design. Up one street another wandered, seeing plenty food windows, carts baskets, never coming way, except form tempting odours issued almost every house, grew keenness strength toward one of the clock. Oh odours!--agonizing angels invisible yet material good! Of joys Father made us capable, poorest necessity linked pain! What tormenting thing--and good must meant come it!--to hungry, downright, cravingly hungry whole microcosm, halfpenny buy mouthful assuagement!--to assailed wafts deliriously undefined promise, one seems likely fulfilled!--promise true men hurrying home dinner luncheon, rousing greater desire Clare Tommy. Not one opportunity appropriation presented itself, else would gone ill Tommy, eyes ears his guardian alert. For Clare thought little thievish pup, whose conduct, manners, education he responsible. The agony began length abate--ready revive augmented strength next hour supplying human furnace begin approach. Few even know hunger is, understand may grow--how desire becomes longing, longing becomes craving, craving wild passion demand. It must terrible hungry, know God! As evening came upon them, worn out, faint want, shivering cold, miserable prospect moment, yet another need presented equally imperative requisition--that shelter might rest. It even imperative: could eat; _must_ lie down! Whether rudiment retained remote ancestry, I cannot tell, kind suffering wake masterful impulse burrow; boys walked misery, white cold hunger, Clare's eyes kept turning every shallowest archway, every breach wall hedge seemed offer least chance covert, while, every then, Tommy would bolt his side peer opening whose depth immediately patent his ferret-gaze. Once, lane outskirts town, he darted narrow doorway face wall, instantly rushed back horror: within well, water lay still dark. Then first Clare hint peculiar dread Tommy water, especially water dark unexpected. Possibly he thrown water got rid of. But Clare moment weary take much notice his dismay. It old town wandering, change channels traffic turned natural nourishment aside, parts withering crumbling away. Not houses were, poverty, utter disuse, yielding fast decay. But causes condition one, which, almost directly came lane I mentioned, end wide silent street, drew roving, questing eyes Clare Tommy. The moon near full shining clear, could perfectly see state in. Most windows broken; roof like back old horse; chimney-pots jagged stumped fracture; one them, entangled string, skeleton kite hung half-way front. But, notwithstanding signs neglect, red-brick wall wrought-iron gate, seven feet high, shut place street, stood perfect aged strength. The moment saw it, house seemed say them, “There is nobody here: come in!” gate wall said, “Begone!” Chapter XIX. The blacksmith his forge. At end wall rough boarded fence, contact it, reaching, fifty yards so, hovel blacksmith, unknown antecedents, taken possession forsaken forge, odd jobs came his way. The boys went along fence till came forge, where, looking in, saw blacksmith working his bellows. To one instincts Clare's birth breeding, he look desirable acquaintance. Tommy less fastidious, he felt scowl man's brows boded little friendliness. Clare, however, hardly knew fear was, hesitate go in, he drawn cart-rope glow fire, sparks which, gazed, began, like embodied joys, fly merrily iron. Tommy followed, keeping Clare well black-browed man, rained his blows rosy iron his pincers, he hated it. “What want, gutter-toads?” he cried, glancing seeing approach. “This are not hotel.” “But it is splendid fire,” rejoined Clare, looking his face wan smile, “and we are cold!” “What is me!” returned man, who, savage something, ready quarrel anything. “I did not make fire warm little devils better never born!” “No, sir,” answered Clare; “but I do not think we would better born. We are cold, nobody Tommy knows hungry I am; fire beautiful that, would let us stand beside minute two, would not mind.” “Mind, indeed! Mind what, preaching little humbug?” “Mind born, sir.” “Why say _sir_ me? Do not see I am working man?” “Yes, that is why. I think ought say _sir_ _ma'am_ every one something cannot. Tommy I cannot make iron please, can, sir! It would grand thing us could!” “Oh, yes, grand thing, doubt!--Why?” “Because could get something eat, somewhere lie down.” “Could you? Look me, now! I work two men, cannot get work half man!” “That is sad pity!” said Clare. “I wish I work! Then I would bring something eat.” The man tell he work enough--that his drunkenness, bad ways brought him, fact he often dawdled work given him, caused people avoid him. “Who said I had not enough eat? I are not come yet, young 'un! What made say that?” “Because I work, I plenty eat; I nothing do, I nothing eat. It is well I have not work now, though,” added Clare sigh, “for I am tired any. Please may I sit heap ashes?” “Sit like, long 's keep way. I 'are not got nothing give bar iron. I will toast one would like bite.” “No, thank you, sir,” answered Clare, smile. “I am afraid would not digestible. They say toasted cheese are not. I wish I try though!” “You are comical shaver, are!” said blacksmith. “You will come gallows yet, you are good boy! Them Sunday-schools heap gallows!--That are not brother?” By time Tommy begun feel home blacksmith, whose face cloud lifted little, he looked less dangerous. He edged nearer fire, stood light it. “No,” answered Clare, odd doubtfulness his tone. “I ought say _yes_, perhaps, men brothers; I mean I have not particular one own.” “That are not pity; he would ha' better you. I have brother I would choke minute I got chance.” While talked, blacksmith put his iron fire, stood blowing bellows, his attention caught gestures little red-eyed imp, Tommy, making rapid signs him, touching his forehead one finger, nodding mysteriously, pointing Clare thumb his hand, held close his side. He sought indicate thus his companion innocent, nobody must mind. In blacksmith Tommy saw one his sort, blacksmith saw neither Tommy Clare reason doubt hint given him. Not less he inclined draw idiot. “Why let follow about, he are not brother?” he said. “He are not nice look at!” “I want make nice,” answered Clare, “and he will nice look at. You must not mind him, please, sir. He is little boy, 'are not well brought up. His granny are not good woman--at least very, know, Tommy!” he added apologetically. “She is damned old sinner!” said Tommy stoutly. The man laughed. “Ha, ha, chicken! know thing two!” he said, he took his iron fire, laid anvil. But besides brother he would gladly strangle, idiot one he loved little teazed much, that, he died, his conscience moved. He felt therefore little tender toward idiot him. He bethought also his job would soon stage fewer witnesses better, he executing commission certain burglars his acquaintance. He would night! He money his pocket, he wanted drink! “Look here, cubs!” he said; “if 'are not got nowhere go to, I do not mind sleep here. There are not bed bed forge, blankets leather apron: may them, cannot sort harm. I do not mind neither put shovelful slack little water fire; give blow two bellows then, will not stone-dead afore mornin'!--Do not free coals, now, do not set she would fire, take bread poor innocent mouth. Mind I tell you, good boys.” “Thank you, sir,” said Clare. “I thought would kind us! I have one friend, bull, that is good me. So Jonathan. He is horse. The bull's name Nimrod. He wants gore always, he is never cross me.” The blacksmith burst roar laughter idiotic speech. Then he covered fire coal, threw his apron Clare's head, departed, locking door smithy behind him. The boys looked other. Neither spoke. Tommy turned bellows, began blow. “Are not warm yet?” said Clare, seen his mother careful coals. “No, I are not. I want blaze.” “Leave fire alone. The coal smith's, he told us waste it.” “He are not count!” said Tommy, heartless grown man woman set pleasure. “He given us place warm sleep in! It would shame anything he did not like. Have conscience, Tommy?” “No,” said Tommy, know conscience copper. The germ doubt lay God-part him, lay deep. Tommy--no worse many boy born better parents--was like hill full precious stones, grows nothing little dry shrubs, shoots cold sharp rocks every there. “If conscience,” answered Clare, “one must serve both--as far reach! Leave go bellows, I will make you.” Tommy let lever go, turned his back, wandered, dudgeon he capable of, side she would. “Hello!” he cried, “here is door!--and are not locked, it is bolted! Let us go see!” “You may like,” answered Clare, “but touch anything blacksmith's, I will you.” “All right!” said Tommy, went see anything picked up. Clare got stone hearth forge, lay hot ashes, far gone hunger care clothes almost beyond caring for. He soon fast asleep; warmth sleep would nearly much food. Chapter XX. Tommy reconnoitres. Tommy, moonlight, found waste yard, scattered bits iron, mostly old rusty. It interesting place, likely afford anything eat. Yet, instinct human animal, he went shifting prying nosing everywhere. Presently he heard curious sound, he recognized made hen. More stealthily yet he went creeping hither thither, feeling feeling there, hope laying his hand fowl asleep. Urged his natural impulse forage, he forgotten Clare's warning. His hand find her, his grandmother instead Clare smithy, he would broken bird's neck she could cry out; touch her feathers came thought Clare, time he understood Clare said, Clare would do. He knowledge fowls; he heard much talk his grandmother's know something habits; finding she sat still, he concluded her might eggs. To his delight so. The hen belonged house distance, wandered it, obedience secretive instinct animal maternity, strong hens, seek hidden shelter her offspring. This she found smith's yard, beneath mould-board plough lain years. Slipping his hand her, Tommy found five eggs. In greedy haste he took them, every one. I must justice say his first impulse dart Clare. But he taken step toward him, he remembered his threat. With eggs inside him, he could run risk; he would mind blows--not much; he took Clare, unbearable thing was, he would assuredly give every one back hen. He idiot, Tommy look him; but, looking Clare, Tommy neglect himself? If Clare would eat eggs Tommy carried him, certainly he would not, best thing Tommy eat himself! What good thing use steal Clare! The steal would himself! Not step spot Tommy move till he sucked every one five eggs. But he made one mistake: he threw away shells. When he sucked them, he found much lighter-hearted, but, alas, nearly hungry before! The spirit research began move him: eggs, might beside? The moon nearly full; smith's yard radiantly illuminated. But even moon could lend little enchantment scene nothing visible rusty, broken, deserted, despairful pieces old iron. Tommy lifted his eyes looked further. The enclosure small extent, bounded one side garden wall house passed, bottom broken fence, dividing piece waste land probably belonged house. As he roamed about, Tommy spied great heap old iron piled wall, made it, hope enlarging his horizon. He scrambled top, looked over. His gaze fell right big but, full dark water. Twice evening he met horror! There legendary report, though he heard it, I fancy, his mother drowned herself instead him: she fell in, he fished out. Whether origin his fear not, far getting means water-but, Tommy dared cross point. With much trembling he got top wall, turned his back butt, ran along like cat, search place he could descend garden. He went right end, round corner, half-way along bottom he found one. There he came doorway solidly walled outside, door left position inside--ready use court chancery decided house belonged. Its frame flush wall, bolts lock afforded Tommy foothold enough descend, confidence able get again. He landed moonlit wilderness--such wilderness deserted garden speedily becomes, wealth soil converting sooner savage chaos. Full impulse discovery, hope presenting importance Clare bringer good tidings, Tommy forced his way crept overgrown bushes, he reached mossy rather gravelly walk, easy advance. It led house. Had he boy imagination, he would shuddered thought attempting entrance. All windows outside shutters. Those ground floor closed--except one swung fro, must swung many wind since house abandoned. The moon shone dull whitish gleam dusty windows first second stories, great dormers shot slope roof, cast strange shadows upon it. The door garden porch trellis-work, jasmine creeping plants trained; whether anything porch left, one could told thicket creepers, interlaced matted antagonist forces wind growth hint door visible. Clearly nobody within. Tommy sought window open shutter. Through dirty glass, reflection moon, he could see nothing. He tried sash, could stir it. He went round corner one end house, saw another door. But enemy stepped between: moon shone suddenly ground. In hollow pavement gathered pool drip neglected gutters, hidden depth staring round looked him. It third time Tommy's nerves shaken night, he could stand more. At awful vision he turned fled, fell, rose fled again. It imagination Tommy; undefined, inexplicable horror, must because, could reason. Young he he already looked face death, felt awe; he listened gruesomest tales, told altogether without art, never moved hair Only one material two spiritual things power him; one material thing hunger, two spiritual things feeble love Clare, strong horror water seeming depth. Now new element added terror meddling moon fiendish mystery--the secret must, I think, bottomless depth she gave water. He rushed garden. With frightful hindrance overgrowth, he found prisoned door strange perversion become ladder, gained top wall, sped along pursued incarnate dread. Horror horrors! moon looked below: he within yard two big water-butt! Right he must go, for, close it, side wall, heap iron alone he could get down. He tightened every nerve effort. He assured thing would moment; water quiet, could follow him; presently he would find smithy warm forge-fire. The scaring necessity was, he must stoop kneel right water-but, order send his legs advance wall top mound. It moment agony. That moment, appalling unearthly cry, something dark, something hideous, something inconceivable ghastliness, seemed Tommy, sprang right water air. He tumbled wall among iron, lay. The stolen eggs avenged. The hen, feverish unhappy loss her hope progeny, gone butt sip little water. Tommy, appearing wall her, startled her. She, flying screech, startled Tommy, became her unwitting avenger. Chapter XXI. Tommy found found out. When Clare woke his first sleep, he within hour--for he hungry sleep straight on, door, imperfectly closed Tommy, come open, let cold wind moonlight--he raised his elbow, peered his stone shelf dreary hut. He could tell he was, he remembered, his first thought Tommy. He looked him. Tommy nowhere. Then he saw open door, remembered he gone out. Surely time he come back! Stiff sore, he turned his longitudinal axis, crept forge, went shivering look his imp. The moon shone radiant rusty iron, glamour her light rendered shapes fragments suggestive cruel torture. Picking his way among spikes corners edges, he walked hideous wilderness searching Tommy, afraid call fear attracting attention. The hen walking about, disconsolate, she took notice him, neither sight her give hint rouse least suspicion: could he suspect one innocent troubled avenging genius Tommy's white face lay upturned white moon! Her egg-shells lay scattered, ghastly point moonshine, silent witness deed done. Tommy scattered forgot them; moon gathered noted them. But told Clare nothing, either Tommy's behaviour Tommy himself. He came last heap metal, lay Tommy, caught skeleton protrusions. A shiver went he saw pallid face, dark streak blood across it. He concluded trying get wall he failed fallen back. He climbed took his arms. Tommy weight Clare, weak hunger he was, carry smithy. He laid hearth, near fire, began blow up. The roaring wind fire wake him. Clare went blowing. The heat rose rose, brought boy last, comfortable condition. He opened his eyes, scrambled his feet, stared wildly around him. “Where it?” he cried. “Where is what?” rejoined Clare, leaving bellows, taking hold lest he fall off. “The head flew water-but,” answered Tommy shudder. “Have lost senses, Tommy?” remonstrated Clare. “I found lying heap old iron wall, moon shining you.” “Yes, yes!--the moon! She jumped water-but, got hold I getting down. I knew she would!” “I did not think fool, Tommy!” said Clare. “Well, had not pluck go yourself! You stopt in!” cried Tommy, putting his hand his head, sorely hurt idiot call fool. “Come let see, Tommy,” said Clare. He wanted find he much hurt; Tommy thought he wanted go water-but, screamed. “Hold tongue, little idiot!” cried Clare. “You will world coming us! They will think I am murdering you!” Tommy restrained himself, gradually recovering, told Clare he discovered, he found. “There is something yellow jacket! What it?” said Clare. “I believe--yes, is!--you have eating egg! Now I remember! I saw egg-shells, two three, lying yard, poor hen walking looking her eggs! You little rascal! You pig boy! I will not thrash time, you have fetched thrashing. But--!” He finished sentence shaking his fist Tommy's face, looking black he able. “I believe hen herself frighted you!” he added. “She served right, thief!” “I did not know harm,” said Tommy, pretending sob. “Why did not bring share, then?” “'Cos I knowed you would ha' made give  them back hen!” “And did not know harm, lying little brute!” “No, I did not.” “Now, look here, Tommy! If do not mind I tell you, I part company. One us two must master, I will, must tramp. Do hear me?” “I cannot without wictuals!” whimpered Tommy. “I did not come wi' _you_ purpose starved death!” “I dare say did not; I starve, must starve too; I eat, shall first mouthful. What come for?” “'Acos strongest,” answered Tommy, “an' I reckoned would get things coves met!” “Well, I am going get things coves meet, except give me. But patience, Tommy, I will get eat. You must give time, know! I 'are not got work yet!--Come here. Lie close me, we will go sleep.” The urchin obeyed, pillowed his head Clare's chest, went fast asleep. Clare slept while, necessities his relation Tommy fast making man him. Chapter XXII. The smith rage. They slept long, roused hideous clamour rattling door, thunderous blows wooden sides she would. Clare woke first, rubbed his eyelids, whose hinges rusted sleep. He utterly perplexed uproar romage. The cabin seemed enveloped hurricane kicks, air tumult howling brawling, threats curses, whose inarticulateness made sound bestial. There never came pause long enough Clare answer locked in, smith must key his pocket. But Tommy came himself, he generally instant he woke, quickly time his fall, he understood once. “It is blacksmith! He is roaring drunk!” he said. “Let us off, Clare! The devil 'ill pay he gets in! He will murder us beds!” “We ought let his house can,” replied Clare, rising going door. It well he found way opening it, every instant came kick threatened throw lock hinges once. He protested his inability, madman thought he refusing admit him, went tenfold fury, calling boys hideous names, swearing he would set she would fire open once. The boys shouted, man sense listen with, began furious battery door, his whole person ram, Tommy made rear, Clare followed--prudent enough, however, his haste, close back-door behind them. Tommy front, led way bottom yard, fence waste ground, hoping find point quarter he could mount wall. He could face water-but--with moon it, staring immensity lower world. He ran doubled spied, could find foothold. Least ascent possible spot door stood side; bricks smoother elsewhere. He turned corner ran along narrow lane, Clare still following, he thought Tommy knew he about; Tommy could find encouragement attempt scaling wall. They might fled fields lay around; burrowing instinct strong, deserted house drew them. Then Clare, finding Tommy fault, bethought little rascal got heap he discovered him, must afraid go way again. He faced ran, his turn become leader. Tommy wheeled also, followed, misgiving. When reached farther corner bottom wall, stopped peeped round would turn it: might run blacksmith chase them! But sound his continued hammering door came them, went on. They crossed fence ran again, ran faster, every step brought nearer danger: heap iron lay smithy, moment smith might burst she would, rush through, upon them. They reached heap. Clare sprang up; Tommy, urged one side fear drunken smith, drawn dread abandoned Clare, climbed shuddering him. “Mind water-but, Clare!” he gasped; “an' gi' hand up.” Clare already turned top wall help him. “Now let go first!” said Tommy, moment he his foot it. “I know get down.” He scudded along wall, glad Clare butt. Clare followed swiftly. He quick cat-promenade Tommy, he good head, spurred apprehension seen moonlight. Chapter XXIII. Treasure trove. In moments safe thicket foot enemy friend--the garden-wall. How many things persons whose sides altogether friendly! These true selves, must true get them. Tommy took lead, though fresh sinking heart place moon it. Through tangled thicket made found way--and stood house, moon looking roof, drunkard's thunder troubling her still pale light--her _moon-thinking_. But noise haste, Clare would frightened them. There seemed secret house moon determined one else share. They one mind terrify man boy attempt cross threshold! There time, however, heed fancies. “If could get without spoiling anything!” thought Clare. Once in, would hurt nothing, take shelter rest lying good anybody, leave done them! While stood looking house, thundering door smithy ceased. Presently heard voices altercation. One voice smith, quieter last heard it, ill-tempered growling first. The seemed woman. She able far quiet him, probably, he remembered he key his pocket; thought heard door smithy open. Then silent, outcasts pursued quest entrance house. Clare went ferreting Tommy done. He also tried get peep window swinging shutter, better success Tommy. Then he started go round corner next blacksmith's yard. “Look out!” cried Tommy loud whisper, he saw he going. “Why?” asked Clare. “Because there is horrible hole there, full water,” answered Tommy. “I will keep look out,” returned Clare, went. When he half-way along end house, he heard noise he understand, stopped listen. Some one seemed moving somewhere. Then came kind scrambling sound, presently noise great watery splash. Clare shivered head foot. “Something fallen hole Tommy mentioned!” he said himself, ran see. A steps brought Tommy taken great hole. It nothing pool rain-water: splash could come that! Then occurred water-but could far off. He forced his way shrubs various kinds, reaching wall, went back along he came butt. A ray moonlight showed side wet, water lately come edge. He looked means getting peep huge thing. It stood brick stand, left narrow edge clear, edge bulge butt would permit mount. With help small tree, however, he got wall, better. Spying butt, he could see nothing first, chimney moon. A moment more, however, he descried something white dull iron gleam water. It water, floating near surface. He lay wall, plunged his arm butt, laid hold it, drew out. It little heavy size, tiny baby, flannel night-gown, which, he drew out, sent back little noisy streams butt! It lay perfectly still his arms, he know whether dead alive, he thought could hardly drowned soon splash. It drugged, antagonism two means employed kill probably saving life. Clare stood stony bewilderment. What he do? Certainly go mother! The first thing get wall. That he could easily done side, heap; side whence must thrown, would worse difficulty there! He must get baby inside wall! With least one arm occupied, tree-way impracticable. There one way, full danger! But one way, way must taken, Clare hesitate. He started along top wall, poor unconscious germ humanity his arms. He lifted watery coffin, cold arms death, clear air life! True, air cold, filled moonshine; house whose seal might broken! moon saw sun making warm world! Along narrow way, still, keen glimmer, unseen, probably, eye sleeping town, he bore his burden, speeding fast he dared, he must set foot amiss! Had one caught sight him, commotion would tale roused--of spectre boy baby his arms, gliding noiseless moon middle night, along top high brick wall deserted house, one lived within memory man! When he reached door-ladder, he found descent difficult possible. It difficult make his way tangled bushes without scratching baby, which, all, might, alas, beyond hurt! He held close his bosom, life coaxing life “stay little.” Thus laden, he appeared Tommy, heard splash, thought Clare fallen deep hole, courage go see, partly fear verifying his fear, his horror watery abyss. He stood trembling Clare left him. To save baby Clare's thought. The baby one thing universe! If light shone hot sun instead cold moon, looked far like killing bringing life! “And,” thought Clare himself, “there are not much heat body shivery moon!” But sun would wake mount sky, send moon down, would different! Only, nothing could done meantime, would baby then! “Here, Tommy,” he cried, “come see I found water-butt.” At word, Tommy turned flee; confidence Clare, curiosity see what, Clare's arms, could hardly hurt him, prevailed, he drew near cautiously. “Lord, it is kid!” he cried. “It is kid,” said Clare, slang; “it is baby!” “Well! are not baby kid, just?” Tommy know word stood anything else child, indeed meaning long specially applied young goat. A _kidnapper_ _kidnabber_ stealer children. Mr. Skeat tells us _kid_ meant first young one. “You cannot tell it, I am afraid, Tommy!” said Clare. Already eternity he loved helpless little waif Time, small, thin, blue-gray, gin-drugged face; tiny life, hopeless, miserable, yet uncomplaining: thing was, thing bear; come world bear it! Ready die, even Death would it; must live wanted, welcome! “Yes, I can!” answered Tommy evil promptitude. “Put again.” “But would drown it, know, Tommy!” answered Clare, treating like child he not. “We want live, Tommy!” His tenderness baby made speak foolish gentleness. “No, do not!” returned Tommy. “What business _it_ live, cannot get nothing eat?” Clare held faster baby one arm, fist struck straight Tommy, hit eyes, knocked flat. It miserable thing do, made Clare miserable, Tommy half his size, still suffering his fall iron. But dying baby half Tommy's size, milder argument would lost him: he thus sent way understand baby rights; baby could enforce them, one world could would. Never his life Clare show instinctive wisdom knock-down blow hardly blamable little devil! Tommy got once. He much hurt, he hard head though he easily knocked over. From moment he began respect Clare. He loved way; he patronized him, feared offend he stronger he; he respect him, believing little Tommy much finer fellow big Clare. There thousands blow better thing expostulation, persuasion, sort kindness. They nothing blow set door ajar love get in. That hardships, troubles, disappointments, kinds pain suffering, sent many us. We full ourselves, feel grand, never come know poor creatures are, never begin better, knock-down blows loving God gives us. We like them, he spare us that. Chapter XXIV. Justifiable burglary. Tommy rose rubbing his forehead, crying quietly. He dare say word. It well he not. Clare, perplexed anxious baby, mood accept annoyance Tommy. But urchin remaining silent, elder boy's indignation began immediately settle down. The infant lay motionless, little heart beating doubtfully, like ticking clock level, last beat might indeed last. “We _must_ get house, Tommy!” said Clare. “Yes, Clare,” answered Tommy, meekly, went like shot renew investigation end house. He back moment, his face radiant success face could be, craving little body it. “Come, come,” he cried. “We get quite easy. I ha' _been_ in!” The keen-eyed monkey found cellar-window, sunk little level ground--a long, narrow, horizontal slip, grating small area fastened down. He lifted it, pushed open window, went inward rusty hinges--so rusty would quite close again. That he lie. _He_ knew better go first! He belonged school _No. 1!_--all mean beggars. Clare hastened him. “Gi' kid, an' get in; reach better, ye're taller,” said Tommy. “Is much drop?” asked Clare. “Nothing much,” answered Tommy. Clare handed baby, instructing hold it, threatening he hurt it; laid his front, shoved his legs across area window, followed his body. Holding edge window-sill, he let his feet far he could, dropped, fell heap coals, whence he tumbled floor cellar. “You told coals!” he said, rising, calling darkness. “I forgot,” answered Tommy. “Give baby,” said Clare. When Tommy took baby, he renewed moment, began cherish sense injury done poor helpless thing. He pinch it, he dared not, lest cry. When he heard Clare fall coals, heard call depth cellar, he greatly tempted turn end house, throw pool, make wall fields, leaving Clare shift himself. But he durst go near pool, Clare would sure get him! he stood hated creature his unprotective arms. When Clare called it, he got shallow area, pushed baby window, grasping extreme garment, letting hang darkness cellar, head downward. I believe baby sick, for, moment after, Clare could get hold it, began cry. The sound thrilled delight. “Oh, darling!--Cannot let her bit farther, Tommy?” he said, suppressed eagerness. He climbed heap coals, stretching his arms receive her. In faint glimmer diffused light moon, he could distinguish window, blocked Tommy; baby he could see. “No, I cannot,” answered Tommy. “Catch! There!” So saying he yielded his spite, waiting sign preparedness part Clare, let go his hold, dropped little one. It fell Clare knocked over; he clasped he fell, hurtled bottom coals without much damage. “I her!” he cried he got up. “Now come yourself, Tommy.” He known baby his lost sister, thought babies girls. “You will catch me, will not you, Clare?” said Tommy. “The thing you have done again! I cannot set baby catch you!” replied unsuspicious Clare, turned seek exit cellar. He time yet wonder Tommy got out. Tommy came tumbling top coals: he dared left water-but pool moon. “Where you, Clare?” he called. Clare answered top stone stair led cellar, Tommy soon his heels. Going along dark passage, feel way, arrived kitchen. The loose outside shutter belonged it, open, little moonlight came in. The place looked dreary enough cold enough damp brick-floor rusty range; least air, sight moon! If coal alight! “I do not see we are much better off!” said Tommy. “I am cold pigs' trotters!” “Then must baby like!” said Clare, whose heart brimful anxiety his charge. It seemed he never known misery till now. Life death baby--and he could nothing! He cold enough himself, hunger, night, wet deadly cold little body his arms; whatever discomfort he felt, seemed baby feeling it; he imputed baby, pitied baby cold he felt himself. “We need not stay here, though,” he said. “There must better places house! Let us try find bedroom!” “Come along!” responded Tommy. They left kitchen, went next room. It seemed warmer, wooden floor. There hardly light it, felt empty. They went stair. When turned landing half-way, saw moon shining in. They went first room came to. Such bedroom!--larger grander parsonage! “Oh baby! baby!” cried Clare, “now you will live--will not you?” He seemed his Maly infant his arms. The thought place his, he might get trouble there, never came him. Use theft! The room contents water fire even pagans counted every man bound hand his neighbour. There bed! Through cold time waiting them! The counterpane dusty; oh, moth-eaten blankets! But sheets them, quite clean, though dingy age! The moths--that is, legs wings dried-up bodies--flew clouds moved blankets. Not less discovered Paradise! For moths, must found island plum-cake! I know history house--how came shut much it. I know shut chancery, chancery full moths dust worms. I believe nobody town knew much it--not even thieves. It course said haunted, doubtless done something protection. No one knew long stood thus deserted. Nobody thought entering it, aware furniture it. It supposed somebody is property, somebody is business look it: whether looked not, nobody inquired. Happily Clare baby Tommy, nobody's business. With deft hands--for often he seen his baby-sister undressed!--Clare hurried infant's one garment, gently rubbed her little body till quite dry, clean, laid her tenderly heart blankets, among remains eggs grubs mothy creatures--they wild beasts, even stinging things--and covered her up, leaving little opening her breathe through. She cried since Clare took her; she feeble cry; but, alas, question feeding her, he food give her, she crying ever much! He threw his clothes, got mothy blankets beside her. In minutes he began glow, thick pile woolly salvation atop him. He took naked baby his arms held her close his body, grew warmer together. “Now, Tommy,” he said, “you may take clothes, get side me.” Tommy need second invitation, moment fast asleep. A months, even days before, would right painful thing Clare lie near boy like Tommy, suffering taken edge nicety put humanity. The temple Lord may need cleansing, temple Lord is. Clare spirit made _the_ son man go beyond healingly needful, lay his hand--the Sinaitic manuscript says his _hands_--upon leper, word alone would served leprosy: hands man's heart. Repulsive danger lay contact, flesh bones human, cold. Chapter XXV. A new quest. Though comfortable one could sorely lacked food, Clare slept lightly. His baby heavy his mind, he woke early--woke anxious thought boy without food, money, friends, hungry baby. He woke, however, new train reasoning his mind. Babies could work; babies always food given them; therefore babies had not food right ask it; babies could not ask it; therefore charge them, had not food give them, right asking them. He could beg long he able ask work; baby his duty beg, she could wait: she would live till he found work. If he got work day, he would work whole day he got money it, baby would dead time! He crept out, awake sleepers, put his clothes. They dry, would dry sun rose. He like leaving his baby Tommy, he do? She might well die Tommy hunger! Perhaps might easier! He thought nature boy, would best say him. He saw many genial persons slow see, kindness, natural shape, certain dispositions great barrier way learning either love duty. With multitudes, nothing undiluted fear pain shame open door love enter. He searched house medicine-bottle, he seen plenty parsonage, found two. He chose smaller, lest size provoke disinclination. Then he woke Tommy, said him, “Tommy, I am going get baby's breakfast.” “Are not going give _me_ any? Is kid _everything_?” “Tommy!” said Clare, steady look his eyes frightened him, “your turn come next. You will not die want day two yet. I will see soon I can. Only, remember, baby comes first! I am going leave her you. You need not take her up. You are able carry her. You would let her fall. But if, I come home, I find anything happened her, _I'll put water-butt_--I WILL. And I will moon it.” Tommy pulled hideous face, began yell. Clare seized throat. “Make noise again, rascal, I will choke you. If you are good baby I am away, I will not eat mouthful till you have some; you are good her, know happen! You have got thing hands!” “She will go an' something I cannot help, an' you will go drown me!” Again he began howl, Clare checked before. “If wake her up, I will--” He words, shook lack any. “I see,” he resumed, “I shall lock coal-cellar till I come back! Here! come along!” Tommy quiet instantly, fell pleading. Clare lent gracious ear, yielding Tommy's protestations, left his treasure, set his quest. He got kitchen, rustiness fastenings door delaying little, wall imprisoned door, taking care lift little possible his person coping he crossed. He dared go along wall daylight, get smith's yard; he dropped straight ground. The country level, casting his eyes about, he saw, great distance, looked like farmstead. He knew cows milked early, know time was. Hoping anyhow reach place milk put away pans, he set run straight across fields. But he soon found he could run, drop walk. When he got yard, he saw young woman carrying foaming pail milk across dairy. He ran her, addressed her his usual “Please, madam;” pail heavy, she kept without answering him. Clare followed her, looking dairy, saw elderly woman. “Please, madam, could afford much fresh milk would fill bottle?” he said, showing it. “Well, man,” she answered pleasantly, “I think might venture far without fear workhouse! But earth made bring thimble bottle that?” “I money pay it, see, madam; I thought little bottle would better beg with; would not hard farmer!” “Bless boy! Much good drop milk like him!” said woman, turning girl “Is mother's tea?” “No, madam; it is baby--a little baby, madam!--I think hold enough,” he added, giving anxious glance bottle his hand, “to keep her alive till I get work.” The woman looked, her heart drawn boy stood gazing her his whole solemn, pathetic yet strong face--with his wide, clear eyes, his decided nose, large straight, his rather long, fine mouth, trembling eager anxiety, his confident chin. She saw hunger his grimy cheeks; she saw his manners gentleman, his clothes poor enough tramp, though evidently made tramp. She would concluded escaped cruel guardians, she reader _The Family Herald_; would account baby! The baby tally! “How old's baby?” she asked. “I do not know, madam; she came us last night.” “Who brought her?” She imagined boy simpleton, expected one answers inconvenient questions natural history receive nurses. “I do not know, madam. I took her water-butt.” The thing grew bewildering. “Who put her there?” “I do not know, madam.” “Whose baby she, then?” “Mine, I think, madam.” “God bless boy!” said woman impatiently, stared speechless. Her daughter meantime filled phial new milk. She handed him. He grasped eagerly. Tears joy came his big hungry eyes. “Oh, _thank_ you, madam!” he said. “But, please, would tell me,” he continued, looking one other, “how much water I must put milk make good baby? I know wants water, I do not know much!” “Oh, half half,” answered elder woman. “'Are not she got mother?” she resumed. “I think she must mother, I daresay she is tramp,” answered Clare. “I do not want give good milk tramp!” she rejoined. “_I_'m tramp, please, madam!--at least I was not till day yesterday.” The woman looked motherly eyes, her heart swelled her bosom. “Would not like milk yourself?” she said. “Oh, yes, madam!” answered Clare, deep sigh. She filled big cup warm milk pail, held him. He took man scaffold might reprieve death, half lifted his lips, let his hand sink. It trembled so, he set cup shelf beside him, he spilled little. He looked ruefully drops brick floor. “Please, madam, there is Tommy!” he faltered. His promise Tommy sprung upon like fiery flying serpent. “Tommy! I thought said baby girl?” “Yes, baby's girl; there is Tommy well! He is another us.” “Your brother, course!” “No, madam; I am afraid he is tramp. But he is, see, I must share him!” It grew inexplicable! A gruff, loud voice came yard. It farmer's. He bitter-tempered man, his dislike tramps almost hatred. His wife daughter knew he saw boy he would worse rude him. “There is master!” cried mother. “Drink, make haste his way.” “If it is stealing,--” said Clare. “Stealing! It is stealing! The dairy's mine! I give milk I please!” “Well, madam, milk's mine gave me, it is begging ask give piece bread it! I could take share Tommy!” “Run, Chris,” cried mother, hurriedly; “take innocent you--round outside yard. Give hunch bread, let go. For God's sake do not let father see him! Run, boy, run! There is time drink milk now!” She poured back pail, set cup way. There little passage another door, left farmer entered. The kick he would given Clare his heavy boot would, consequences, reached baby too. The girl ran back house. “Wait moment window,” she said. Now whether loving-kindness all, she dared take time divide it, I cannot tell, she handed Clare whole loaf, good big one, home-made bread, disappeared he could thank her, telling run his life. He able now. With farmer behind, hungry ones him, he _must_ run; phial his pocket loaf his hands, he _could_ run. Happily farmer catch sight him. His wife took care he not. I believe, indeed, she got brand-new quarrel spur moment, he might chance. Chapter XXVI. A new entrance. Clare sped jubilant. But soon came check his jubilation: one thing drop wall, quite another climb top without help door! The moment he heard clink smith's hammer his anvil, go his yard daylight would risk much! For would become retreat discovered! He stood foot brick precipice, stared helpless eyes failing strength. Baby inside, hungry, better nurse ill conditioned Tommy; her milk his pocket, Tommy's bread his hand, insurmountable wall them! He daylight now, however, hardly one about: perhaps he could find another entrance! Round outside wall, therefore, like Midianite rather comical hymn, Clare prowl prowl. But wall rose straight much smooth wherever he looked. Searching face he went along bottom garden, narrow lane garden next house, increasing fear way smith's yard, choice risk it. A dozen yards so, however, end lane, took sharp turn entering street, he spied opening wall--the which, night before, Tommy returned frightened face. Clare went through, found narrow passage running left short distance two walls. At end, half one side, half second wall, lay well terrified Tommy. The wall crossed low arch. On side well third wall, space two feet half side round well. Through wall might door!--or, not, might way getting it! To cross well would awkward, he must it! He tied loaf his pocket-handkerchief--he far past fastidiousness, Tommy knew neither word thing--and knotted ends round his neck. But his chief anxiety break bottle his jacket-pocket. He got his knees parapet. How deep dark water looked! For moment he felt fear something like Tommy's. How he cross awful gulf? It like free jump; he hemmed behind, overhead also. But baby drew well, name Beatrice drew Dante fire. The baby waiting him, done! He made cat-leap beneath arch, reaching his hands catching parapet beyond. He catch it, enough hold by, his body follow his legs water. Oh, cold found his run! He held on, strained heaved up, made great reach across width parapet one hand, laid hold outer edge, made good his grasp it, drew water, well. He narrow space, closed walls much higher his head, he saw way he come in--across fearful well, seemed, dark water, go ever. He felt his pocket. If he found baby's bottle broken, I doubt Clare would ever got place, except door next world. What little strength he nearly gone, I think would gone quite. But bottle safe his courage came back. He examined his position, presently saw narrowness his threatened prison would make prison all. He found that, leaning his back one wall, pushing his feet opposite wall, making third wall rack his shoulder, he could worm slowly up. It task strong man, Clare, though strong his years, moment strong. But baby waiting, her milk! He fell to, and, agony exertion, wriggled last top--so exhausted he fell side. He pulled together, dropped into, garden. Happier boy Clare England then. Hunger, wet, incipient nakedness, he torn his clothes badly, nowhere. Baby within his reach, milk within baby's! He ran, dripping like spaniel, find her, shot stair room held his treasure. To his joy he found Tommy baby fast asleep, Tommy tired weary tramping day before, baby still influence opiate her mother given her make her drown quietly. Chapter XXVII. The baby her breakfast. He waked Tommy, showed loaf. Tommy sprang his lair snatched it. “No, Tommy,” said Clare, drawing back, “I cannot trust you! You would eat all; I died hunger, would become baby, left alone you? I do not feel sure would not eat _her_!” Baby started feeble whimper. “You must wait till I have attended her,” continued Clare. “If got quietly without waking her, I would given share once.” As he spoke, he pulled blanket bed wrap her in, made haste take her up. A series difficulties followed, I leave imagination mothers aunts, nurses general--the worst warm water wash her in, cold water would worse dangerous she gone night before. Clare comforted washing thing non-essential existence, however desirable well-being. Then came serious difficulty: milk must mixed water, water cold Clare's legs would kill drug-dazed shred humanity! What done? It would equally dangerous give her strong milk cow undiluted. There one way: he must feed her pigeons. First, however, he must water! The well almost inaccessible: get return would fearfully waste life-precious time! The rain-water little pool must serve necessity! It preferable butt! Until many years after, occur Clare strange even drop water water-butt. Whence fed? There roof near, rain might run it. If ever pipe supply it, surely, house long forsaken, continuity must given way One always sees barrels empty, dry, cracked: one apparently known full water, woman her senses, however inferior senses, would throw her child empty butt! How happen full? Clare almost driven conclusion filled evil purpose night put. Against fact would easy fill huge vessel hand. I suggested blacksmith his predecessors might used purposes forge, kept feeder repair. Mr. Skymer endeavoured repeatedly find become blacksmith, never approach success; probability he left world long his natural time, disease engendered quarrel occasioned his drunkenness. Clare laid baby down, fetched water pool. Then he mixed milk seemed right quantity, took baby up, whimpering little time, laid blanket, several times folded, his wet knees, laid her her blanket upon it. These preparations made, he took small mouthful milk water, held grew warm. It way, I condescend remind reader may think proper disgusted. When he put his mouth baby's, careful let much go once, managed she successfully appropriated mouthful. It followed second, third, more, until, Clare's delight, child seemed satisfied, leaving precious fluid another meal. He put her bed again, covered her warm. All time, Tommy watching loaf eyes wild beast. “Now, Tommy,” said Clare, “how much loaf think ought have?” “Half, course!” answered Tommy boldly, perfect conviction his fairness, pride same. “Are big I am?” Tommy held his peace. “You are not half big!” said Clare. “I am bloomin' lot hungrier!” growled Tommy. “You eggs last night, I none!” “That wurn't fault!” “What get bread?” “I staid home baby.” “That is true,” answered Clare. “But,” he went on, “suppose horse pony got divide food them, would pony right half? Would not horse, bigger, want keep alive pony?” “Do not know,” said Tommy. “But shall half,” continued Clare; “only I hope, this, get anything given you, you will divide me. I try fair, I want fair.” Tommy made reply. He trouble fair play; he wanted he could get--like people; though, thank God, I know far anxious give receive fair play. Such men, noblemen tradesmen, I worship. Clare carefully divided loaf, due deliberation, handed Tommy seemed bigger half. Without word acknowledgment, Tommy fell upon like terrier. He would love Clare little he something give--but stomach heart Tommy! His sort well represented every rank. There many time love hungry. Chapter XXVIII. Treachery. “Now, Tommy,” said Clare, eaten his half loaf, “I am going look work, must take care baby. You are feed her--you would choke her, waste good milk.” “I want go too,” said Tommy. “To see pick up, I suppose?” “That is business.” “I fancy mine me. If do not take care baby good her, I will put water-butt I took her of--as sure are not now!” “That shall not!” cried Tommy; “I will bite first!” “I will tie hands feet, put stick mouth,” said Clare. “So you would better mind.” “I want go you!” whimpered Tommy. “You cannot. You are stop look baby. I will not away longer I help; may sure that.” With repeated injunctions leave room, Clare went. Before going quite, however, he must arrange returning. To swarm two walls he done before, would bid good-bye his jacket least, he knew appearances already him. Spying whatever might serve his purpose, he caught sight old garden-roller, making it, Tommy, never doubting he gone, came whistling round corner house his hands his pocket-holes, impudent air independence. Clare away, he lord his eyes! He could kill baby he pleased! Plainly his mood was, “He thinks I am going he tells me! Not I knows it!” Clare saw he saw Clare, rushed roar. “You thought I gone!” he cried. “I told leave room! Come along water-butt!” Tommy shivered he heard him, gave shriek he saw coming. He shook till his teeth chattered. But terror always paralyzes instinct wild animal. As Clare came running, he took one step toward him, dropped ground his feet. Clare shot away his head, struck his tree, lay minute stunned. Tommy's success greater he hoped. He scudded house, closed bolted door kitchen. When Clare came himself, he found he cut his head. It would never go asking work bloody face! The little pool served basin mirror, he washed he thought. He inclination punish Tommy trick he played him; he done his kind! It would serve good end too: Tommy would imagine lurking his revenge, would venture his nose out. He discovered afterward little wretch made fast cellar-door, that, he entered way, he would caught trap, unable go return. He got iron roller foot wall, he come night before, first he perceived door; managed, broken handle lever, set end, filled earth, heaped mound earth steady it, placed broken tiles sherds chimney-pots upon it, rickety perch found he could reach top easily. The next thing arrange getting side. For he threw earth stones whatever rubbish came his hand, sole quality required his material being, serve lift fraction inch higher. The space narrow his mound require sustained width base except one direction; everywhere else walls kept heap, he made good speed. At length he descended it, sure able get again. He gone hour Tommy dared leave room baby was. He planned Clare got it: he would threaten, he came step nearer, kill baby! But he coal-cellar, he would make his conditions! A tramp would keep promise, Clare would! he promised touch him, he come out--not he died hunger! At length he could bear imprisonment longer. He opened room-door caution one thought tiger might lying it. He saw one, crept half steps. By slow degrees, interrupted many inroad terror many swift retreat, he got stair garden; whence, closest search, he length satisfied his enemy departed. For time he his master! To one like Tommy--and rare--it fine thing his master. But person master servant--and master serve! Tommy, however, quite satisfied master servant, himself. What he do? Go something eat, course! He would back long Clare! He gone look work--and would give _him_ work? If Tommy big Clare, lots people would give work! But catch working! Not he knew it!--not Tommy! Never till she grown up, never, indeed, she middle-aged woman Mr. Skymer's housekeeper, baby know danger she morning, alone surnameless Tommy. His first sense relation creature weak protect itself, consciousness power torment creature. But case exercise power brought another relation, one water-butt! He went back room child lay her blankets like human chrysalis, stood moment regarding her hatred far mild: he actually expected give time personal notice contemptible thing lying unable move? _He_ was not girl old woman! He must go get something eat! man for! Better twist her neck go! But he could forget water-butt--proximate mother child. Its idea came sliding Tommy's range, grew grew upon Tommy, came nearer nearer, baby nowhere, nothing world water-butt. His consciousness possessed it. It preparing swallow loathsome deep! All jumped back him, stood motionless side wall. Now his chance! Now he must mizzle! Not moment longer would he stop place horrible thing! But baby! Clare would bring back put butt! No, he would not! What harm would come brat? She able roll herself bed! She could nothing go sleep again! Out he must would go! He wanted something eat! He would long Clare could get back! He left room house, ran garden, scrambled door, got top wall, dropped waste land behind it--nor thought way back jaws water-butt. Chapter XXIX. The baker. Clare went wall well without notion he going do, except look work. He eaten half loaf, drew his cap water well drank. He felt better moment since leaving farm. He full hope. All his life he never hopeful. To human hope natural hunger; yet hope hunger! Men proud small, one wonders pitch conceit arrived time nothing all. They proud love little, believe less, hope nothing. Every fool prides fool believe would make man him. For dread taken in, he takes ridiculously. The man keeps trying his duty, finds brighter brighter gleam issue, he walks, lantern his hope. Clare breaking song he heard his mother sing his sister, he checked sight long skinny mongrel like hairy worm, lay cowering shivering beside heap ashes put dust-cart--such dry hopeless heap famished little dog care search it: little warmth it, I presume, kept near it. Clare's indigence made sorry indigent, he felt sorry member family; he neither work alms give him, therefore strode on. The dog looked wistfully him, recognizing one his sort, one would help he could, follow him. A hundred yards further, Clare came baker's shop. It first he felt inclined enter, he went in. He know shop whose cart Tommy pilfered. A thin-faced, bilious-looking, elderly man stood behind counter. “Well, boy, want?” he said low, sad, severe, unkindly voice. “Please, sir,” answered Clare, “I want something do, I thought perhaps could help me.” “What do?” “Not much, I _try_ anything.” “Have ever learned anything?” “I have working farm last six months. Before I went school.” “Why did not go going school?” “Because father mother died.” “What father?” “A parson.” “Why leave farm?” “Because did not want me. The mistress did not like me.” “I dare say she her reasons!” “I do not know, sir; she did not seem like anything I did. My mother used say, 'Well done, Clare!' mistress never said 'Well done!”' “So farmer sent away?” “No, sir; he boxed ears something--I do not remember what.” “I dare say deserved it!” “Perhaps I did; I do not know; he never before.” “If deserved it, right run away that.” The baker taught Sunday-school, good teacher, able make class mind him. “I did not run away that, sir; I ran away he tired me. I could not stay make uncomfortable! He kind me; I fancy mistress made change. I have thinking good deal it, that is looks me. I am sorry creatures more.” “What creatures?” “The bull, horses, cows, pigs--all creatures farm. They friends. I shall see somewhere!” He gave great sigh. “What mean that?” asked baker. “I hardly know I mean,” answered Clare. “When I am loving anybody I always feel I shall see person time, I do not know when--somewhere, I do not know where.” “That do not apply lower animals; it is nothing foolish imagination,” said baker. “But I love them!” suggested Clare. “Love bull, horse, pig! You cannot!” asserted baker. “But I _do_,” rejoined Clare. “I love father mother much alive!” “What it?” returned baker. “That I know I love father mother, I know I love fierce bull would always I told him, dear old horse almost past work, always ready his best.--I am afraid they have killed now!” he added, another sigh. “But beasts 'are not got souls, cannot love them. And could, that is reason see again.” “I _do_ love them, perhaps souls!” rejoined Clare. “You must not believe that! It is quite shocking. It is nowhere Bible.” “Is everything Bible shocking, sir?” “Well, I will not say that; you are believe it.” “I suppose do not like animals, sir! Are afraid going place die?” “I would not boy held unscriptural notion! The Bible says--the spirit man goeth upward, spirit beast goeth downward!” “Is Bible, sir?” “It is,” answered baker satisfaction, thinking he proved his point. “I am glad!” returned Clare. “I did not know anything Bible! Then I die I shall go somewhere, look till I find them!” The baker silenced moment. “It is flat atheism!” he cried. “Get shop! What world coming to!” Clare turned went out. But though bilious, baker unreasonable unjust man except he used believe his life contradicted. Clare yet shut door he repented. He good man, though quite secret universe. He vaulted counter, opened door ringing appended bell made heavy-hearted Clare turn he heard his voice. The long spare white figure appeared threshold, framed doorway. “Hi!” shouted. Clare went meekly back. “I have remembered hearing--but mind I _know_ nothing, pledge nothing----” He paused. “I did not say I _sure_ it,” returned Clare, thinking he referred fate animals, “but I fear I am blame sure.” “Come, come!” said baker, twist his mouth expressed disgust, “hold tongue, listen me.--I hear, I saying, Mr. Maidstone, town, one his errand-boys laid scarlet fever. I will take him, like. Perhaps he will you,--though I cannot say look respectable!” “I 'are not much chance since I left home, sir. I bit soap, but----” He bethought he better say nothing his family. Tommy picked his pocket soap night before, tried eat it, Clare hidden away: he wanted wash baby soon he could get warm water; he went find wash his face, gone. He suspected Tommy, long he terrible ground different surmise. “You see, sir,” he resumed, “I things think of. When tummy's empty, do not think rest you--do you, sir?” The baker could remember ever decently, healthily hungry his life; he rough well-bred boy hungry wash his face! Perhaps word _one little ones_ came him. He regard spoke it, though he talk Sundays obey days between. “I do not know, boy,” he answered. “Would like piece bread?” “I am much want moment,” replied Clare, “but I greatly obliged would let call by. You see, sir, man work, he cannot help money!” “A man!” thought baker. “God pity you, poor monkey!” He called one mind shop, removed his apron put coat, shut door, went street Clare. Chapter XXX. The draper. At shop draper haberdasher, one might buy almost anything sold, Clare's new friend stopped walked in. He asked see Mr. Maidstone, shopman went fetch behind. He came public floor. “I heard want boy, sir,” said baker, carried presence superior; certainly fine clothes gold chain ring could make draper superior baker. “Hm!” said Mr. Maidstone, looking contempt Clare. “I rather liked look poor boy, ventured bring approval,” continued baker timidly. “He are not much look at, I confess!” “Hm!” said draper again. “He do not look promising!” “He do not. But I think he means performing,” said baker, wan smile. “Donnow, I am sure! If he 'appened wash his face, I could tell better!” Clare thought he washed pretty well morning his cut, though he had, sure, done without soap, rather dirty work since! “He says he is hungry wash his face,” answered baker. “Did not 'ave his 'ot water time, I suppose!--Will answer him, Mr. Ball?” “I cannot, Mr. Maidstone--not one way another. I simply taken him. I know nothing him.” Here one shopmen came his master, said, “I heard Mr. Ball's man yesterday accuse boy taking loaf his cart.” “Yesterday!” thought Clare; “it seems week ago!” “Oh! boy, it?” said baker. “You see I did not know him! All same, I do not believe he took loaf.” “Indeed I did not, sir! Another boy took did not know better, I took him, putting back cart man turned round saw me, would not listen word I said. But working-man believed me, bought loaf, gave us.” “A likely story!” said draper. “I have heard much,” said baker, “and I believe it. At least I reason believe man him, Mr. Maidstone. That night I discovered he cheating merry tune. I discharged morning.” “Well, he certainly do not look respectable boy,” said draper, naturally, surface himself, could read deeper clothes; “but I am greatly want one carry parcels, I do not mind I try him. If he steal anything, he will caught within hour!” “Oh, thank you, sir!” said Clare. “You shall sixpence day,” Mr. Maidstone continued, “--not penny till I am sure you are honest boy.” “Thank you, sir,” iterated Clare. “Please may I run home first? I will not long. I 'are not got clothes, but----” “Hold long tongue. Do not let hear wagging establishment. Go wash face hands.” Clare turned baker. “Please, sir,” he said softly, “may I go back get piece bread?” “What! begging already!” cried Mr. Maidstone. “No, no, sir,” interposed baker. “I promised piece bread. He ask it.” The good man pleased his success, began regard Clare favour springs heart done good turn another third. Had he helped his pocket, he might much pleased. But loss, risk! He beside shown his influence superior! “I much obliged you, sir!” said Clare went away together. “I cannot tell much!” He tempted open his heart reveal fact three people would live sixpence day baker's kindness procured him, prudence fast coming frontward, he saw one must know house! If known, would probably turned once, would go far fatal family. For, he pay lodgings, tramps paid Tommy's grandmother, sixpence day would suffice bare shelter. So he held his tongue. “Thank minding Mr. Maidstone's interests,” returned his benefactor. “If do not well him, blame come upon me.” “I careful, sir,” answered Clare, full honesty think honest; he thought minding orders. They reached shop; baker gave small loaf, he hurried home The joy his heart, spread days since he left farm, would given fair amount gladness. Taking heed one saw him, he darted passage well, got across better time, rushed wall like cat, fell side unsteadiness his potsherds, rose hurried house, feeble wail his baby his ears. Chapter XXXI. An addition family. The door kitchen open: Tommy must garden again! When he reached nursery, he called himself, he found baby he left her, moaning wailing piteously. She looked she cried till she worn out. He threw clothes take her. A great rat sprang bed. On one tiny feet long thin toes bleeding raw. The instant arose loud scampering scuffling squealing room. Clare's heart quivered. He thought whole army rats. He bit afraid himself, assuredly company baby! Already smelt food house, come swarm! What done little one? If he stayed home her, she must die hunger; he left her alone, rats would eat her! They begun already! Oh, wretch, Tommy! Into water--but he go! I hope friends take ill that, his life after, Clare felt less kindly disposed toward rats toward rest creatures God. But things nearly bad Clare thought: scuffling came quite another because. It suddenly ceased, sharp scream followed. Clare turned baby his arms. Almost his feet, gazing him, rat hanging limp his jaws, stood little castaway mongrel he seen morning, his eyes flaming, his tail wagging wild homage delight presenting rat one he would fain make his master. “You darling!” cried Clare, meant dog time, baby. The animal dropped dead rat his feet, glared, wagged, looked hunger incarnate, would touch rat Clare told take it. Then he retired corner, made rapid meal it. He seen Clare pass second time, doubtless noted he carried loaf, followed humble hope. Clare much occupied his joy perceive him, else he would certainly given little peeling two outside bread. But decreed dog honour rendering first service. Clare _all_ benevolences. What happy day him! It day remembered ever! He work! he sixpence day! he present milk baby, two presents bread--one small, one large loaf! And dog! A dog many meals! The family four now! A baby, dog take care baby!--It heavenly! He made haste gave his baby milk water left. Then he washed her poor torn foot, wrapped pillow-case, he would tear anything, laid her bed. Next he cut good big crust loaf gave dog, ate rat nowhere. The rest he put drawer. Then he washed his face hands--as well he could without soap. After that, he took dog, talked little, laid bed beside baby talked again, telling plainly, impressing upon him, his business care baby; he must give her; he must watch tend, and, needful, fight little one. When length he left him, evident Clare, solemnity dog's face, he understood his duty thoroughly. Chapter XXXII. Shop baby. Once clear well wall, Clare set running like gaze-hound. Such change produced joy satisfaction hope, he entered shop, one first knew him. His face face angel, none less beautiful shone ragged garments. But Mr. Maidstone, moment he saw him, he time recognize him, turned boy dislike. “What fool beggar looks!” he said himself;--then aloud one young men, “Hand parcel sheets.--Here, you!--what is name?” “Clare, sir.” “I declare it!” he rejoined, coarse laugh pleasure his fancied wit. “I shall call Jack!” “Very well, sir!” “Do not talk.--Here, Jack, take parcel Mrs. Trueman's. You will see address it.--And look sharp.--You read, cannot you?” The people shop stood looking on, pitifully, curiously, parcel considerable size, linen heavy, boy looked pale thin. But Clare strong his age, present joy made past want. He scarcely looked parcel draper proceeded lay his shoulder, stooped little he felt weight, heaved little adjust balance, holding place one hand, started door, master held open him. “Please, sir, way I turn?” he asked. “To left,” answered Mr. Maidstone. “Ask way go.” Clare forgot he heard lady's name. Her address parcel, doubt, he dropped look, he could get himself. A little way on, therefore, meeting boy his age returning school, he asked kind enough read address his back direct him. The boy read aloud, gave false instructions finding place. Clare walked walked weight became almost unendurable, last, though loath, concluded boy must deceived him. He asked again, time lady. She took pains tell right, make understand right: she pleased tired gentle face looked beneath heavy burden. Perhaps she thought proud souls growing pure pride, Dante's _Purgatorio_. Following her directions, he needed questioning find house. But hours burden gone his shoulder rid phantom weight. His master rated long, would permit explain his delay, ordering hold his tongue answer back; rest his day's work lighter; heavy parcel send out. There many smaller ones, however, that, time delivered, he gained something general idea streets lay, weary wight when, four-pence his master hesitated give ground he doubtful his character, he set last, walking soberly enough now, spend Mr. Ball's milk-shop. Of former he bought stale three-penny loaf, baker added piece make weight. Clare took liberality, returned hearty thanks, Mr. Ball, I sorry say, man enough repudiate. The penny he laid milk--but oh, inferior farmer's wife given him! The milk-woman, however, ungraciously granted two matches he begged for. On his way baby, he almost hoped Tommy would return: he would gladly saved putting water-butt! He forgot he drew near nursery, long he reached it. He found infant dog lying he left them. The sign either moved strange cleanness tiny gray face Clare ventured wash. It gave indubitable evidence dog licking little--probably every minutes since he left curate charge. And Clare deliberation thing his sensitive conscience unfrequently reproached afterward. His defence was, he hurt nobody, kept baby alive it. Having his mind revolved matter many time day, he got sticks together garden, one precious matches lighted small fire coals his own, he could merely hope one day restore amends. But baby! Baby coals! He filled rusty kettle water, growing hot fire, his fear lest smoke betray them, he ran every minute see much coming chimney. While fire busy heating water, he busier preparing bottle baby--making hole cork phial, putting broken stem clean tobacco pipe he found street hole, tying small lump cotton wool end pipe-stem, covering piece his pocket-handkerchief, carefully washed brown Windsor soap, his mother's last present. For day held yet another gladness: looking kettle he found soap--which probably rat carried away hidden finding baby. Through pipe-stem wool handkerchief he could without difficulty draw water, hoped therefore baby would succeed drawing her supper. As soon water warm he mixed milk, much time, put mixture bottle. To his delight, baby sucked splendidly. The bottle, thought heavy linen hard street, success! Labour unfriendly thought, annals weaving shoe-making witness. And last Clare equipped great attempt: he going wash baby! He glad disrespectful Tommy house. With basin warm water his precious piece soap he set it, taking much pains washed his treasure perfectly clean. It state bliss which, moment, I presume, she never since her birth. In process he handled her, skill nurse, yet tenderness mother. His chief anxiety hurt, could helped, poor little rat-eaten toes. He felt he must wash them, process she whimpered, went calves his legs. When happy solicitous task over, infant shown submission great weakness, he wrapped her another blanket, laid her again. Soothed comfortable, probably never soothed comfortable before, she went sleep. As soon she his arms, he took piece bread, hot water made little sop dog, small hero, whose four legs carried long barrel starvation, ate undisguised pleasure thankfulness. For his supper Clare preferred his bread dry, following fine draught water well. Then, till then, returned thought--what Tommy done himself? Left he sure go stealing! He might taken act! Clare could hardly believe he actually run away him. On hand, he left baby, knew he returned he would put water-butt! He might come conclusion he could better without Clare, would let steal! It clear he like taking his share work family, looking baby! Had he anything true boy, Clare would taken his bread his hand gone look him; he was, he think necessary. He felt bound his best he came back, he feel bound leave baby roam country find boy baby's life would constant danger. Chapter XXXIII. A bad penny. Before Clare done his thinking, darkness fallen, and, weary bones, he threw bed beside baby. The dog jumped laid his feet, place his time immemorial--as perhaps been, according time dog-land. The many pleasures blessed day would kept Clare awake brought much weariness. He fell fast asleep. Tommy happy day: he found evil-doing, done evil, day dread punishment. He foresee ill things would go him--did see rat taken his place beside baby, he would get back Clare; vision water-butt often flashed upon his inner eye, bliss his solitude. He deserted his post hope finding something eat, mouthful anything spongy turnip, dried-up mangel-wurzel, want-root. If he minding his work, he would piece good bread--so good he would wanted it, whereas, he eaten turnip beetroot, he wish he eaten much! He set upon boys bigger himself, nearly bad, who, hungry, want amusement, proceeded get Tommy, Tommy would got baby he dared. They bullied way would his heart's content, he bully instead bullied. They made actually wish he stayed baby--and therewith came thought time go home he would get back Clare. As taken place morning, he knew Clare's forgivingness, despised it. If he found baby dead, anything happened her he could cover lying, would time cut run earnest! So moment he could escape his tormenters, went Tommy home. But he ran he remembered one way house, lip water-butt. Clare woke suddenly--at sound his life would wake deepest slumber: he thought he heard whimpering child. The baby fast asleep. Instantly he thought Tommy. He seemed see shut night, knew him: he gone without thinking he get back, dared go near water-butt! He jumped bed, put his shoes, minute two wall walking along lane outside it, find deserter. The moon up, night dark, yet he looked long he came upon him, near house he could get, crouching wall. “Tommy!” said Clare softly. Tommy reply. The fear water-butt upon him--a fear darker night, evil worse hunger cold--and Clare water-butt one. “You need not think hide, Tommy; I see you, bad boy!” whispered Clare. “After I said, ran away left baby rats! They have biting her horribly--one least has. You stay away long like now; I have got better nurse. Good-night!” Tommy gave great howl. “Hold tongue, rascal!” cried Clare, still whisper. “You will let police know are!” “Do let in, Clare! I am 'ungry cold!” “Then I shall put water-butt! I said I would!” “If do not promise to, I will go straight police. They will take brat you, put her workhouse!” Clare thought moment whether would right kill traitor. His mind full history-tales, and, like Dante, he put treachery place, namely deepest hell. But thought came words he said many times without thinking meant--“Forgive us trespasses, forgive trespass us,” he saw he expected forgive Tommy. “Tommy, I forgive you,” he said solemnly, “and friends again; I said it, I right say it, water-butt must go! I cannot trust word now, I think I shall able trust that.” Ere he finished words, Tommy lifted his voice unearthly screech. Instantly Clare throat, he could utter sound. “Tommy,” he said, “I am going let breathe again, moment make noise, I will choke I am now.” With he relaxed his hold. But Tommy paid heed he said, began second screech moment he found passage it. Immediately he choked, two three attempts, finally desisted. “I will not!” he said. “You shall, Tommy. You are going head butt. We are going now!” Tommy threw upon ground kicked, dared scream. It awful! He would drop right great place moon was! Clare threw his shoulder, found half weight parcel linen. Tommy would bitten like weasel, he feared Clare's terrible hands. He back Giant Despair, form one best boys world. Clare took round wall, fence blacksmith's yard. The smithy quite dark. “Please, I did not mean it!” sobbed Tommy behind him, Clare bore steadily yard. It he could say words, thought approaching sent scream his throat every time he parted his lips speak. Clare stopped. “What did not mean do?” he asked. “I did not mean leave baby.” “How then?” “I mean I did not mean stay away long. I did not know get back.” “I told leave her! And could got back perfectly, little coward!” Tommy shuddered, said more. Though hanging Clare's back he knew presently, his stopping, come heap. There heap wall water-butt! Up he felt slowly, shakingly carried, gathering his breath final utterance agony rouse whole neighbourhood, Clare, reached top, seated upon wall, Tommy restrained hope parley might bring. But he sat wheel pivot his spine, he seen counter shop, sit his legs alongside water-butt. Then he drew Tommy his shoulder, spite his clinging, laid across his knees; Tommy, divining words yet said, hoping get beating, he mind, remained silent. “Your hour come, Tommy!” said Clare. “If scream, I drop in, hold one leg. If do not scream, I hold legs. If scream I take out, go again! I I say, Tommy!” The wretched boy nearly mad terror. But now, much he feared water, he feared yet moment lay power water. Clare took heels. “I am sorry there is moon, I promised you,” he said; “she will not come calling. I liked see going. But are not honest boy this, shall another chance; next time wait moon!” With he lifted Tommy's legs, holding ankles, would shoved his body edge butt water. But Tommy clung fast his knees. “Leave go, Tommy,” he said, “or I will tumble right in.” Tommy yielded, his overcome greater fear. Clare let hang moment black water, slowly lowered him. Tommy clung side butt. Clare let go one leg, taking hold his hands pulled away. Tommy's terror would burst frenzied yell, instant he neck water, lifted again. He spluttered gurgled tried scream. “Now, Tommy,” said Clare, “do not scream, I will put again.” But Tommy never believed anything except upon compulsion. The moment he could, moment he screamed, moment he water again. The next time he taken out, he scream. Clare laid wall, he lay still, pretending drowned. Clare got up, set his feet front him, holding collar, trotted round top wall door, dropped garden. He quiet enough now--more subdued--incapable even meditating revenge. But entered nursery, dog, taking Tommy worse sort rat, made leap right bed, he would swallow alive, start terror brought quite again. “Quiet, Abdiel!” said Clare. The dog turned, jumped bed, lay close baby. Clare, who, I said, old days reader _Paradise Lost_, already given name _Abdiel_. “Please, I could not help yelling!” said Tommy, meekly. “I did not know you would got _him_!” “I know could not help it!” answered Clare. “What eat to-day?” “Nothing beastly turnip wormy beet,” said Tommy. “I am awful hungry.” “You would something better you would stuck baby, left her rats!” “There are not rats,” growled Tommy. “Will believe eyes?” returned Clare, showed skin rat Abdiel slain. “I have great mind make eat it!” he added, dangling tail. “Should not mind,” said Tommy. “I have eaten rat afore now, an' I am hungry! Rats are not bad eat. I do not know skins!” “Here is piece bread you. But shall not sleep honest people like baby Abdiel. You shall lie hearth-rug. Here is blanket pillow you!” Clare covered warm, thatching piece loose carpet, he asleep directly. The next day terror water-butt gone little vagabond's mind. He now, however, thoroughly afraid Clare, his conceit that, though Clare stronger, he cleverer, put abeyance. Chapter XXXIV. How things went time. Clare's next day went much preceding, he early shop. When his dinner-hour came, he ran home, glad find Tommy dog mildly agreeable other. He time give baby milk, Tommy Abdiel bit bread each. His look he returned, look he unaware, one girls, year ago hungry weeks together, could read, made her ask he dinner. He said he dinner. “Why?” she asked. “Because was not any.” “Did not mother keep you?” “No; she could not.” “Then do?” “Go without,” answered Clare smile. “But you have got mother?” said girl, rendered doubtful his smile. “Oh, yes! I have got two mothers. But arms are not long enough,” replied Clare. The girl wondered: he idiot, called poet? Anyhow, she bun her pocket, she meant eat five of the clock, she offered that. “But yourself? Have another?” asked Clare, unready take it. “No,” she answered; “why should not I go without well you?” “Because will not make things better. There much hunger. It is shifting you. That leave same!” “No, same,” she returned. “I have good dinner--as much I could eat; you have none!” Clare persuaded, ate girl's bun much satisfaction gratitude. When he his wages evening, he spent before--a penny baby, fivepence Mr. Ball's Tommy, Abdiel, himself. Observing he came daily, spent he earned, except one penny, bread; seeing also boy's cheeks, though plainly he good health, thin, Mr. Ball wondered little: boy ought look better five pennyworth bread day! They curious family--Clare, Tommy, baby, Abdiel. But thing sad was, Clare, head heart it, provided all, upheld human sympathy, human gratitude; he high his companions that, though he never thought he lonely, he could help feeling lonely. Not he wish rid single member his adopted family. It living his body; he growing little thinner every day; things gone so, he must long fallen ill; he never thought all, body soul. He human sympathy gratitude, I say, he sympathy gratitude Abdiel. The dog never failed understand Clare wished expected understand. In Clare's absence he took protection establishment, Tommy's superior. Though Tommy use earn bread, Clare therefore allow idle. He insisted his keeping place clean tidy, respect Tommy quite failure. He even made washing, though much could accomplished way little wash. Now Abdiel nurse, Tommy run garden, often went beyond hour two without Clare's knowledge, always took good care back his return. A bale goods happening unpacked his presence one day, Clare begged head-shopman, also partner, piece wrapped in; he, noted well he worked, quite aware could get another boy wages, gave large piece soiled canvas. Now Mrs. Person taught Clare work,--as I think boys ought taught, helpless without mother sister,--and help needle thread friendly girl gave him, he soon made packing-sheet pair trousers Tommy, primitive unserviceable cut, shirt himself, fashion primitive still. He managed way: he cut hole middle piece stuff, put his head, another hole side that, put his arms, hemmed round. Then, first hemmed garment also, he indued it, let voluminous mass arrange might, much his jacket trousers cohered. My reader may well wonder how, called respectable shop, he could permitted appear poverty; Mr. Maidstone disliked boy much he meant send away moment he found another his work, gave orders he never come basement except wanted carry parcel. The fact his still, solemn, pure face haunting rebuke his master, although he least recognize nature, because, his dislike. Chapter XXXV. Clare disregards interests his employers. Things went nearly month, every one thriving Clare. Yet Clare peaceful any, much happier Tommy, whose satisfaction adventure needful. One day, lady, attracted muff shop-window labelled low price, entered, requested see it. “We offer choice several sort, madam,” said shopman. “It one lot bought cheap, quite uninjured, fire.” “I want see one window,” lady answered. “I hope excuse me, madam,” returned shopman. “The muff position hard reach. Besides, must ask leave take anything window dressed day, master out. But I bring fur precisely.” So saying, he went, returned presently load muffs furs, he threw counter. But lady heard “there is tricks i' world,” persisted demanding sight muff window. Being “tall personage” cool, she carried her point. The muff hooked brought her--not graciously. She glanced it, turned over, looked inside, said, “I take it. Please bring bandbox it.” “I will, madam,” said man, would taken muff. But she held fast, sought her purse, laid price counter. The shopman saw she knew about, took money, went fetched bandbox, put muff her eyes, tied up. The lady held her hand it. “Shall I send you, madam?” he said. “I live here,” she answered. “I way station.” “Here, Jack,” cried shopman Clare, he caught sight moment going basement, “take bandbox, go lady station.” If his transaction lady pleased man, he would sent scarecrow attend her, although she belong town, might never see her again! The lady, her part, insist carrying bandbox herself; Clare came forward, looked smiling her face, she aware she might trust him. The man stood watching moment she turn her back, he might substitute another bandbox one Clare carried; Clare never looked him, lady walked shop, walked straight her. Along street he followed her steadily, she looking round occasionally see he behind her. They gone half-way station, side street came lad Clare knew one employed packing-room. He carried box exactly like Clare his hand, came softly behind him. Clare turn his head, he want talk he attending lady. “Look spry!” he said whisper. “She do not twig! It is right! Maidstone sent me.” Clare looked round. The lad held his bandbox take, his empty hand take Clare's instead. But Clare time begun learn little caution. Besides, lady's interests his care, he could party nothing done behind her back! He time think, knew his duty stick bandbox. If come animals are, Clare must dog good, faithful breed, he right ancient instinct. He held fast box, neither slackening his pace uttering word. The lad gave great punch. Clare clung harder box. The lady heard something, turned her head. The boy already his back her, walking away, she saw Clare's face flushed. “What matter?” she asked. “I do not rightly know, madam. He wanted give bandbox his, said Mr. Maidstone sent him. But I could not, know!--except he asked first. You pay it--did not you, madam?” “Of course I did, he would not let take away! But do not know means, I do.--You have not shop long, you?” “Not quite month, madam.” “I thought so!” She said more, Clare followed silence, wondering little. When reached station, she took bandbox, looked boy. He returned her gaze, his gray eyes wondering. She searched her purse shilling, but, unable find one, sorry give half-crown instead. “You better mention I gave anything?” she said. “I not, madam, except ask me,” he answered. “But,” he added, his face glow delight, “is me?” “To sure,” she answered. “I much obliged for--carrying parcel. Be honest boy whatever comes, repent it.” “I try, madam,” said Clare. But, speak accurately, he know _try_ honest: he never tempted anything else, scarcely idea dishonesty his mind except relation Tommy. Do say, “Then merit him”? Certainly none. Who thinking merit? Not Clare. He sneak thinks merit. He cad cannot gentlemanly action without thinking fine fellow! It might merit many man act Clare did, Clare pure rightness--or, like word better, righteousness. Clare little thought awaited him. Had truth, appreciation honesty his vulgar heart, Mr. Maidstone could done he did. When his messenger came back tale he foiled, he said nothing, his lips grew white. He closed fast, went stood near door. When Clare, unsuspecting innocent, opened it, he met blow dazed him, fierce kick sent his back curbstone. Almost insensible, impression something interfering his work, he returned door. As he laid his hand it, opened little, his master's face, hateful sneer upon it, shot crack, spit his. Then door shut sharply his fingers caught agonizing pinch. At last he understood: he turned off, his day's wages lost! What would become half-crown lady given him! She _quite_ lady, she would walked shop, declined gain frustrating swindle; she good-hearted woman, God's messenger Clare. He bought bigger loaf usual, which, time day he bought it, half-crown presented payment, Mr. Ball wondered; neither said anything--Mr. Ball indecision, Clare eagerness get home his family. Chapter XXXVI. The policeman. But, alas! Clare made another enemy--the lad whose attempt change bandboxes he foiled. The fellow followed him, lurkingly, way home--on watch fit place pounce upon him, punish right he wanted wrong. He saw turn opening led well, thought he him. But he followed in, he seen! He care cross well, knowing might meet side; news carry back! He so; his master saw opportunity indulging his dislike revenge, means invalidating whatever Clare might reveal his discredit! Clare baby Tommy Abdiel taken supper satisfaction, asleep. It middle night, though past ten of the clock, Abdiel jumped right his four legs, cocked his ears, listened, leaped bed, ran door, began bark furiously. He suddenly blinded glare bull's-eye-lantern, received kick knocked bark him, threw side room. A huge policeman strode quietly in, sending glare his bull's-eye room like vital, inquiring glance. It discovered, one other, every member family. So tired Clare, however, he wake seized rough hand, one pull dragged standing floor. “Take care baby!” he cried, yet half awake. “_I'll_ take care baby, never fear!--an' too, young rascal!” returned policeman. He roused Tommy, wide awake, pretending asleep, gentle kick. “Up ye get!” he said; Tommy got up, rubbing his ferret eyes. “Come along!” said policeman. “Where to?” asked Clare. “You will see get there.” “But I cannot leave baby!” “Baby must come along too,” answered policeman, gently, he children his own. “But she clothes go in!” objected Clare. “She must go without, then.” “But she will take cold!” “She do not run naked house, she?” “No; she cannot run yet. I keep her blanket. But blanket are not mine; I cannot take me.” “You are mighty scrup'lous!” returned policeman. “You do not mind takin' 'ole 'ouse an' garding, wouldn' think takin' blanket!--Oh, no! Honest boy _you_ are!” He turned sharp round, caught Tommy taking vigorous sight him. Tommy, courageous lion behind anybody's back, dropped rug sitting. “We have done house harm,” said Clare, “and I _not_ take blanket. It would stealing!” “Then I take it, accountable it,” rejoined man. “I hope satisfy you!” “Certainly,” answered Clare. “You policeman, makes right.” “Rouse then, come along. I want get home.” “Please, sir, would not morning?” pleaded Clare. “I have work now, could easily go then. That way sleep.” “My eye are not green enough,” replied policeman. “Look sharp!” Clare said more, went baby. With sinking courageous heart, he wrapped her closer her blanket, took her his arms. He could help her crying, she scream. Indeed she never really screamed; she strong enough scream. “Get along,” said policeman. Clare led way his bundle, sorely incommoded size weight wrapping blanket, corners which, one other, would keep working his hold, dropping trailing ground. Behind came Tommy, scarecrow monkey, mischievous face, greedy beads eyes--type unknown policeman, brought rear, big enough sizes cut him, yet pass man. Down stair went, front door, Clare first time saw open, iron gate street. “Which way, please?” asked Clare, turning half round question. “To right, straight ahead. The likes you, young un, might know way lock-up without astin'!” Clare made answer, walked obedient. It sad procession--comical indeed, sad realized continue ludicrous. The thin, long-bodied, big-headed, long-haired, long-tailed, short-legged animal followed last, seemed close never-ending end. There moon; nothing gas-lamps lighted Clare's _Via dolorosa_. He hugged baby kept on, laying his cheek comfort her, receiving comfort he seek. They came last _lock-up_, new building rear town-house. There tangle humanity, torn rock afloat social sea, drifted trailing bare brilliant room, head, cast destroyed, went heavy-laden Clare, much him, his misery patent eyes much used misery reap sorrow sight. The head policeman--they called inspector--received charge, house-breaking, entered it. Then taken away lock-up--all faithful Abdiel, who, following, received another kicks day rained every member epitome human family except baby, who, small enough mother drown, small policeman kick. The door shut upon them, rest grave till resurrection morning bring magistrate. Their quarters worse chilly--to baby her blanket manifoldly wrapped her, Clare's arms. Tommy would gladly shared blanket, gladly yet would taken left baby perish; he lie broad wooden bench make best it, he snoring night. It passed drearily Clare, kept wide awake. He anxious morrow; he nothing ashamed of, therefore nothing fear; he baby protect cherish, he dared go sleep. Chapter XXXVII. The magistrate. The dawn came last, soon dawn footsteps, approached recede. When door length opened, let pair eyes glance round them, close again. The hours seemed always beginning, never going on. But long last came big policeman. To Clare's loving eyes, friendly he looked! “Come, kids!” he said, took long passage room town-hall, sat formal-looking old gentleman behind table. “Good morning, sir!” said Clare, astonishment magistrate, set his politeness impudence. Nor mistake wondered at; baby Clare's arms hid, mountain-like folds blanket, greater part his face, old gentleman's eyes fell first Tommy; ever _scamp_ written clear countenance, written clear Tommy's. “Hold impudent tongue!” said policeman, gave Clare cuff head. “Hold, John,” interposed magistrate; “it part punish, yours.” “Thank you, sir,” said Clare. “I thank _you_, sir,” returned magistrate, “not speak till I put questions I put you.--What charge prisoners?” “Housebreaking, sir,” answered big man. “What! Housebreaking! Boys baby! House-breakers do not generally go babies arms! Explain thing.” The policeman said he received information unlawful possession taken building commonly known The Haunted House, Chancery one could tell many years. He gone see, found accused possession best bedroom--fast asleep, surrounded indications made home time. He brought along. The magistrate turned his eyes Clare. “You hear policeman says?” he said. “Yes, sir,” answered Clare. “Well?” “Sir?” “What say it?” “Nothing, sir.” “Then allow true?” “Yes, sir.” “What right there?” “None, sir. But nowhere else go, nobody seemed want place. We did not hurt anything. We swept away multitude dead moths, killed lot live ones, destroyed whole granary grubs; dog killed great rat.” “What name?” “Clare--Porson,” answered Clare, little intervening hesitation. “You quite sure?” “Yes; name; I another older one I do not know.” “A bad answer! The name go own! Hum! Is boy brother?” “No, sir.” “Your cousin?” “No, sir; he is relation mine. He is tramp.” “And you?” “Something like one now, sir, I was not always.” “What you?” “Not much, sir. I did not _do_ anything till lately.” He could bear moment talk his be-loved dead. He felt old gentleman would rude them. “Is infant sister?” “She is sister big way: God made her. She is sister way.” “How she come then?” “I took her water-butt. Some one threw her in, I heard splash, went got her out.” “Why take her police?” “I never thought that. It I could keep her alive. I could not done had not got house.” “How long ago that?” “Nearly month, sir.” “And you have kept her ever since?” “Yes, sir--as well I could. I sixpence day.” “And what is boy's name?” “Tommy, sir.--I do not know other.” “Nice respectable company keep one evidently well brought up!” “Baby's quite respectable, sir!” “Hum!” “And Tommy, I did not keep him, he would steal. I am teaching steal.” “What woman got you?” “Baby's woman we have got, sir.” “But attends her?” “I do, sir. She wants washing rolling round blanket; she is got clothes speak of. When I am away, Tommy Abdiel take care her.” “Abdiel! Who earth that? Where he?” said magistrate, looking round fourth member incomprehensible family. “He is earth, sir; he is heaven--the good angel, know, sir, left Satan came back God.” “You must take county-asylum, James!” said magistrate, turning tall policeman. “Oh, he is right, sir!” said James. “Please, sir,” interrupted Clare eagerly, “I did not mean dog heaven yet. I meant angel I named after!” “They _had_ little dog them, sir!” “Yes--Abdiel. He wanted prisoner too, would not let in. He is good dog--better Tommy.” “So! like rest you, keep dog!” “He followed home he had not anybody love,” said Clare. “He do not much eat, he is content. He would eat three times much I could give him; he never complains.” “Have work sort?” “I till yesterday, sir.” “Where?” “At Mr. Maidstone's shop.” “What wages you?” “Sixpence day.” “And lived, three you, that?” “Yes; four us, sir.” “What shop?” “Please worship,” interposed policeman James, “he sent his business yesterday.” “Yes,” rejoined Clare, understand phrase, “I sent lady carry her bandbox station.” “And came back, turned away, was not you?” said James. “Yes, sir.” “What done?” asked magistrate. “I do not quite know, sir.” “A likely story!” Clare made reply. “Answer directly.” “Please, sir, told speak unless asked question.” “I said, 'A likely story!' meant, 'Do expect believe that?'” “Of course I do, sir.” “Why?” “Because true.” “How I believe that?” “I do not know, sir. I know I have got speak truth. It is person hears that is got believe it, are not it, sir?” “You have got prove it.” “I do not think so, sir; I never told so; I told I must speak truth; I never told I must prove I said.--I have several times disbelieved, I know.” “I think indeed!” “It people know me.” “Never people know you?” “I think not, sir. I never people home.” “Ah! could read thinking!” “Were believed home, sir?” The magistrate's doubt Clare source fact that, although he careful speak truth people, his habit boy, he suffered severely consequence. He annoyed, therefore, his question, set hypocritical, boastful prig, seized strong desire shame him. “I remand prisoner evidence. Take children workhouse,” he said. Tommy gave sudden full-sized howl. He heard good workhouse. “The baby mine!” pleaded Clare. “Are father it?” said big policeman. “Yes, I think so: I saved her life.--She would drowned I had not looked her I heard splash!” reasoned Clare, his face drawn grief struggle keep crying. “She is yours,” said magistrate. “She belongs parish. Take her away, James.” The big policeman came take her. Clare would held her tight, afraid hurting her. He draw back outstretched hands, however, he put question two. “Please, sir, parish good her?” he asked. “Much better you.” “Will let go see her?” he asked again, outbreaking sob. “You cannot go anywhere till you are this,” answered big policeman, and, ungently, took baby him. “And be, please?” asked Clare, his empty arms still held out. “That depends his worship there.” “Hold tongue, James,” said magistrate. “Take boy away, John.” “Please, sir, I going to?” asked Clare. “To prison, till find you.” “Please, sir, I did not mean steal her. I did not know parish wanted her!” “Take boy away, I tell you!” cried magistrate angrily. “His tongue goes like hopper mill!” James, carrying baby one arm, already pushing Tommy neck. Tommy howled, rubbed his red eyes left cuffs, attempt resistance. “Please, do not let anybody hold her upside down, policeman!” cried Clare. “She does not like it!--Oh, baby! baby!” John tightened his grasp his arm, hurried away another direction. Where big policeman issued his charge, Abdiel hovering his spring wound tight would not go off. How he came door, I cannot imagine. When he spied Tommy, he rushed him. Tommy gave kick rolled over. “Do not want _you_, mangy beast!” he said, tried kick again. Abdiel kept away that, followed party workhouse, also, his disgust, plainly expressed, he refused admittance. He returned entrance Clare vanished his eyes night before, lay there. I suspect he approximate canine theory whole matter. He knew least Clare gone others door; he come door; that, therefore, probability, he within door still. The police made inquiry Mr. Maidstone's shop. Reasons his dismissal given involving accusation: little desire quarter matter searched into. There therefore nothing discredit boy, beyond his running earth neglected house like wild animal. After three days he set liberty. As big policeman led way door send out, Clare addressed thus: “Please, Mr. James, may I go back house little while?” “Well, _are_ innocent!” said James; “--or,” he added, “the biggest little humbug ever I see!--No, it is likely!” “I wanted,” explained Clare, “to set things straight bit. The house cleaner was, _I_ know, good order went it. I do not like leave worse found it.” “Never heed,” said James, believing perfectly he knew he about. “The house do not belong nobody, far ever I heerd, an' things'll rot wherever stand.” “But I like,” persisted Clare. “I could not hook, an' his worship would think wanted steal something. The best thing leave place once, an' go nobody knows nothing agin you.” Thought Clare himself, “If house does not belong anybody, would not let stay it?” But policeman opened door, he turning say good-bye him, gave little shove, closed behind him. Chapter XXXVIII. The workhouse. He went street white face dazed look--not hardship he experienced his confinement, he clover, he lost baby Abdiel, his mind time perplexity regard proceedings justice: he could see he done anything wrong. Throughout his life never mattered much Clare accused anything wrong, trouble him, time least, punished right. He took quietly, however. Indignation may sign innocence, necessary consequence innocence proof righteousness. A man fiercely indignant accusation happens false, thing last week, ready again. Indignation wrong another even, proof genuine love fair play. Clare hardly resented anything done himself. His inward unconscious purity held up, made look events face eye single therefore forgiving fearless. The man mote his eye cannot knocked beam his neighbour's; he busy mote his neighbour's may stumble destruction beam his own. White dazed he came out, moment he stepped across threshold, Clare met comfort God waiting him. His eyes blinded great light, glorious morning beginning June, he found assailed unknightly fashion knee: there, his unspeakable delight, Abdiel, clinging his fore-legs, wagging his tail if, like lizards terror, he would shake gladness! What blessed little pendulum Abdiel's tail! It went weight clock universe called devotion. It escapement delight essence existence, which, God set right “our disordered clocks,” consciousness. Clare stood moment looked him. The needle his compass went round round. It north. He could go back shop; he could go back house; baby workhouse, he could stay even would let him! Neither could he stop town; policeman said he must go away! Where he go? There world one place better another! But would let see baby he went!--and he set find workhouse. Abdiel followed quietly his heel, his master walked lost thought, Abdiel hungry make merry without his notice. Clare, fresh world, great reader one young, could encounter new experience old knowledge. In his mind stood pile fir-cones, dried sticks, old olive wood, merest touch experience would set blaze practical conclusion. But workhouse near his reflections he reached amounted this--that worse places prison done nothing deserve put it. A palace may one them. You get enough eat prison; palace not; get much! The porter workhouse informed day seeing inmates; tall policeman given Clare hint, he requested see matron. After much demur much entreaty, man went told matron. She, knowing story baby, wanted see Clare, much pleased his manners looks, his sad clothes pleaded him. She took room baby many more, telling he must prove she his picking her out. It wonderful Clare, knew faces animals well, know his baby moment he saw her, notwithstanding she decently clothed, already improved appearance. But nurses declared never seen man, say boy, could tell one baby another. “Why,” rejoined Clare, “my dog Abdiel could pick baby he nurse to!” “Ah, he is dog!” “And I am boy!” said Clare. He descried her lap old woman, seeming old, head nursery-department. Old she was, however, she keen eye, handsome countenance, quantity white hair. Unlike rest women, though far removed socially, she knew several languages, far read enjoy books them. Now great woman may found workhouse, like first folio Shakspere bookstall, among--oh, companions! “Let take her,” said Clare modestly, holding his hands baby. “Are sure let her drop?” “Why, madam,” answered Clare, “she is baby! It I took her water-butt! I washed fed her every day!--not I could well you, madam!” She gave baby, watched eye seeress, she wonderful insight character, one roots prophecy. “You good true lad,” she said length, “and hard success lies you. I do not know come to, but, eyes, forehead, hands, come anything good, terribly blame.” “I try good, madam,” said Clare simply. “But I wish I knew put prison for!” “What, indeed, lamb!” she returned; her eyes flashed indignation cornice her white hair. “They will put prison one day it!” “Oh, I do not mind!” said Clare. “I do not want punished. You see I am waiting!” “What waiting for, sonny?” asked old woman. “I do not exactly know--though I know better I put prison for. Nobody ever told anything, I am always waiting something.” “The something come, child. You want! Only go you are doing, you will great man one day.” “I do not want great man,” answered Clare; “I am waiting till coming come.” The woman cast her eyes, seemed lost thought. Clare dandled baby gently his arms, talked loving nonsense her. “Well,” said old woman, raising length her eyes, look reverence them, Clare's, “I cannot help you, want help mine. I have got money, but--” “I have got plenty money, madam,” interrupted Clare. “I have got whole shilling pocket!” “Bless holy innocent!” murmured woman. “--Well, I promise this--that long I live, baby shall not forget you; I are not old I look.” Here matron came up, said he better going now; he came back day month, he see baby again. “Thank you, madam,” replied Clare. “Keep her good baby, please. I come her one day.” “Please God I live see day!” said old woman. “I think I shall.” She live see it, though I cannot tell part story now. Chapter XXXIX. Away. So Clare went street, Abdiel watching him, stood pavement, knowing way turn. The big policeman told one would give work happened; now, therefore, he waiting direction present itself. In moment occurred that, come one end town, he better go other. He followed suggestion, Abdiel followed him--his head hanging his tail also, joy recovering his master used remnant wag his clock. He frolic scamper Clare first saw him. How poor thing subsisted last days, hard tell. It much he escaped death ill-usage. Meanest wretches boys men turn like grim death upon helpless. Except change way, helplessness overtake like thief, look one deliver find none. Traitors duty protect, one day find yet pitiful plight ever they. But I fear believe fate throat. Clare saw dog famished. He stopped butcher's bought scrap meat penny. Then he elevenpence begin world afresh, hungry. Out highway went, perfect English summer day, world them. It oyster Clare open sword, pen, _sesame_; he might find place outside that, way better--one he _could_ open get heart of. The sun shone day earthquake--deep Clare's dimmest memorial cavern;--shone he knew, come might, well; he shone his heart went dark, nothing would go wrong; while, present, everything depended his shining his glorious best. “Come along, Abdiel,” said Clare; “we are going see comes next. At worst, know hunger is, doggie, good deal borne pretty well--though I am fond you, doggie! We will beg till we are downright forced, will not steal. When that is next thing, we will sit down, wag tails, die.--There!” He gave last piece his meat, trudged time without speaking. The sun hot, past noon hour two, came public-house, pump it, trough. Clare grew thirsty he saw pump, imagined rush thick sparkling curve spout. But handle locked chain, keep men women water instead beer. He went longing trough, water unclean that, thirsty he was, he could look even last resource. He walked house. “Please, madam,” he said woman bar, “would allow pump little water drink?” “You think I have got nothing serve tramps water!” she answered, throwing back her head till her nostrils right angles horizon. “I am tramp, madam,” said Clare. “Show money, then, pot beer, like honest folk.” “I am afraid I told wrong, madam,” returned Clare. “I am afraid I _am_ tramp all; _I_'m looking work, tramps are not, I fancy.” “They _say_ are,” answered woman. “That is story, that is theirs!” “I have got elevenpence, madam; could, I dare say, buy pot beer, though I do not know price one; I do not see I am going get money, must serve Abdiel till do.” “What right _you_ dog, are not fit pay penny half-pint beer?” “Do not hard young 'un, mis'ess; he do not look bad sort!” said man stood pewter pot his hand. Clare wondered he his cord-trousers pulled inches tied his knees string, made little bags there. He think mile left public-house he discovered keep tightening his knees he stooped, incommoding his work. “Thank you, sir,” he said. “I am bad sort. I did not know harm ask water. It are not begging, it, sir?” “Not I knows on,” replied man. “Here, take lot!” He offered Clare his nearly emptied pewter. “No, thank you, sir,” answered Clara “I thirsty--but thirsty take drink you. I get next pump. Perhaps will not chained like bull!” “Here, mis'ess!” cried man. “This mate knows neighbour he sees him. I will stand half-pint. There is yer money!” Without word woman flung man's penny till, drew Clare half-pint porter. Clare took eagerly, turned man, said, “I thank you, sir, wish good health,” drained pewter mug. He never tasted beer, indeed drink stronger tea, he like it. But he thanked his benefactor again, went back trough. “Dogs do not drink beer,” he said himself. “They know better!” lifting Abdiel he held trough. Abdiel fastidious his master, lapped eagerly. Then pursued uncertain way. Ready anything, he thought shabbiness his clothes would greater bar indoor outdoor work, applied therefore every farm came to. But he look able he was, boys much wanted. He never pitied himself, never entreated: beg work beggary, beggary he would descend driven approaching death. But tender-hearted woman, oftener one ripe years, struck his look--its endurance, perhaps, weariness mingled hope--would perceive necessity boy, offer food he ask--nor like less that, never doubting came one both, he gave first share Abdiel. Chapter XL. Maly. Travelling vague hope, meeting kindness enough keep alive, getting employment, sleeping shelter he could find, never missing shelter he could find, weather exceptionally warm warm season, he came one day village strangest hardest experience he ever encountered awaited him. What part country he in, name village, he know. He seldom asked question, seldom uttered word beyond polite greeting, kept trudging on, goal his expectation ever drawing nigher. He felt curiosity names places he passed through. Why names towns villages strung road nowhere particular, interest him? He did, however, long afterward, come know name village, topographical relations: place branded his brain. He entered glow hot noon, walked nearly without meeting one, dinner-hour, savoury odours filled air, little girl came neat house, ran farther street. He tired, dusty, eaten nothing day, begun despair work, wishing clear houses he might throw down. But something look child made quicken his weary step he followed her. He overtook her, passed her, saw her face. Heavens! Maly, grown wonderfully bigger! He turned caught her his arms. She gave screech terror, he set her keenest dismay. Finding he going run away her, she run farther safe parleying distance. “You bad boy!” she cried; “you are touch me! I tell mamma!” “Why, Maly! do not know me?” “No, I do not You dirty boy!” “But, Maly!--” “My name Maly; it is Mary; I do not know you.” “Have forgotten Clare, Maly?--Clare used carry day long?” “Yes; I forgotten you. You are dirty, ragged beggar-boy! You are bad boy! Boys holes clothes bad boys.--Nursie told so, she knows everything! She told herself she knew everything!” She gave another though milder scream: involuntarily, Clare taken step toward her, his hand his pocket, searching, old days she cried, something give her. But, alas, his pockets empty his stomach! _nothing_ them--not even crumb saved scanty meal! While he yet searching, little child, his heart's love--if indeed she--stooped, gathered handful dust, threw him. The big boy burst tears. The child mocked minute, Clare looked again, drying his eyes rag, she gone. He felt resentment; love, old memories, his strange gentleness, pity Maly Maly's mother, saved it. The child big plump rosy, oh, fallen his little Maly! And, her child grown such, mother poor indeed, though dome angels! If she know change her, worse, she could help! Clare, like readers, yet learned trust God everything. But he true Maly. Miserable her backsliding, he said evil counsellors blame she. “Did she know all?” he pondered; “or she forgot altogether?” He began doubt whether girl really Maly, one like her. About half hour after, he met poor woman bundle her bowed back, gave piece bread. When he eaten that, he began doubt whether he met little girl. He remembered he often come himself, he wandered along road, find he lost fancies old scenes imaginary new ones; waked up, he realize poor lad tramp work he could find: his conceptions time stronger things around him. He thereupon comforted hope he reality seen Maly, imagined whole affair. How possible, though, he imagine horrible things his little sister? On hand, possible fainting brain imagine misery, live child behave fashion? Every day many days he tormented like reasonings; degrees occurrence, whether fancy fact, receded, he grew conscious tramping, tramping along. He grew also hopeless getting work, doubtful everything right. For he knew nothing he done bring things upon him. His quiet content never left him. At worst pinch hunger cold, he never fell despair. I know merit he this, he constituted hopeful placid I ever knew another. What he merit was, hungry boy's powerful temptation, something eat, would he even imagine must done. He would lead temptation. Thus he pleased Power--let rather say, ten times truly--the Father he came. Chapter XLI. The caravans. Within fortnight police dismissed him, blowing loose world like dandelion-seed wind, Clare adventure gave pleasure, led work food interest life. Passing one day cross-country road highway, he came straight flank travelling menagerie. It one size, Clare saw glance horses fair condition. The front part little procession already gone by, elephant passing moment caravan--of feline creatures, Clare afterwards learned, behind him. He drew absolute ease, his head seemed dragged earthward weight his trunk, he plodded wearily along. A world delight woke heart boy. He read much strange beasts, never seen one. His impulse run straight elephant, tell he loved him. For he live beast, Clare loved every creature, common strange, wild tame, ordinary wonderful. But prudent thought followed, he saw better hover around, hope chance useful. Oh, treasures wonder knowledge side thin walls wood, slowly drawn along dusty highway! If moment he might gaze living marvels! He money, things came without money--not plentifully he could sometimes wish--but came, might this! Employment among animals would well worth long hungry waiting! This might work he looking without knowing it! It this, perhaps, he kept long waiting--till caravans come along road, he corner passed! He know often man may think thus see come nothing--because better yet behind, waiting wanted. At end procession came bear, shuffling along uncomfortably. It went Clare's heart see far comfortable poor beast appeared. “What life would be,” he thought, “to creatures caravans make happy! That would life worth living!” It worthy ambition--infinitely higher boys want something great, clever, strong. As want rich--for ambition I utter contempt. How gladly would I drive meanness boy's heart! To fall work glad creator, help it--that ambition worth having. It may look grand thing caravan, takes mind Christ anywhere. Behind bear, closing procession, came stoutish, good-tempered-looking man, small spring-cart, drawn small pony: he earthly owner caged life, gathered discomforts. Clare lifted his cap he passed him--a politeness man took notice, boy ragged. The moment he past, Clare fell behind one procession. He prudent enough, however, go near look intrusive. When he followed thus mile two, he saw, signs patent every wanderer, coming near town. Before reaching it, however, arrived spot hedges receded road, leaving little green sward sides it, long line came halt. The menagerie had, day before, exhibited fair, way another, held next day town approaching: made halt order prepare entrance. To let part treasure seen, best way rouse desire yet hidden: going, therefore, take animal two walk parade. Clare sat little distance, wondered coming next. Experience tramps made men suspicious, may disliked proceedings watched anybody; but, happily Clare, master came him, without something menace his bearing. The boy never afraid, hope started full grown man approached. He rose took his cap--a ready action Clare, sprung pure politeness, nothing either selfish cringing. But man put his interpretation civility. “What hanging for?” he said rudely. Now Clare perfect right answer, he pleased, he king's highway, one right interfere him. But he habit--he could help it; natural him--of thinking first party's side question--a rare gift, served better he knew. For may right, ugly thing interfere man's right; man's rights never much good he waives them. “I beg pardon, sir,” he said; “I understand wished alone. I never thought would mind me. Will far enough I go sight, I tired? It pleasant, besides, know friends near!” The man recognized Clare modes speech gentleman; having, course his wandering life, seen known good many strange things, he suspected rags history. But he interested enough stop inquire it. “Never mind,” he said, altered tone; “I see you are mischief!” walked away, leaving Clare he pleased. A minutes went by. Clare sat hungry sleepy grass roadside. Before he knew, he his feet, startled terrible noise. The lion opened his great jaws, his brown leathery sides, working like pair bellows, sent his throat huge blast, half roar, half howl. When Clare came he knew, though he never heard before, fearful sound voice lion. He know meant was, his majesty thought his dinner. It indeed much audible gape. He stood moment, terrified, half expecting see huge yellow animal burst one caravans--he could guess which: roar much loud indicate one rather another. He sat again, longer inclined sleep. For time, however, second roar came ribs captive monarch. Chapter XLII. Nimrod. That fair far partly account follows. As Clare sat resting, he could do, sleep fled food nowhere, roar different kind invaded his ears. It came along road time, caravans. He looked, spied would brought heart throat many grown man. Away road, direction whence menagerie come, he saw cloud dust confused struggle, presently resolved two men, end rope, animal attached ropes ring his nose. It bull, terrible excitement, bounding way that, dragging driving men--doing his best fact break away, one them, other, once. It must tortured pull strong men cartilage his nose, he great rage feel much. Every moment his hoofs would higher his head, hoofs head horns would scraping ground fruitless rush send one his tormentors space beyond ken bulls. With swift divergence, like scenting hound, he twisted shot his huge body. The question men bull seemed one endurance. The pale-faced boy, though full interest strife, yet food day, sufficient spirits run meet animal whirlwind, watch closer chances; struggle came length near enough follow almost every detail it: he could see bloody foam drip poor beast's nostrils. When fifty yards away, bull, sudden twist, wrenched rope hands one men. He fell his back. The dropped his rope fled. The bull came scouring highway. A second roar, muffled thunder, issued leathery flanks lion. The bull made sudden stop, scoring ground his hoofs. It seemed full career he started back. Then went his head, like black flash, accompanying thunder bellow defiant contempt wrath, he charged one caravans. He taken hungry lion's roar challenge combat. It nothing bull voice unknown monster; he ready whatever monster might prove. The men busy caravans wagons, caught sight coming, first moment terror beast accustomed, bolted refuge behind upon them: would sooner encountered tiger broke loose. The moment, astounding shock, head bull went crack near hind-wheel caravan whose shafts stood elephant, patiently waiting orders. The bull caught sight elephant, he would doubtless “gone for” him, caravan. His ear, finer Clare's, must distinguished whence roar proceeded: caravan, sure enough, lion, rest great cats. He answered blow bull's head roar thunderously different his late sleepy leonine sigh. It roused every creature menagerie. From greatest smallest took cry. Out burst tornado terrific sound, filling horror quiet noontide. The roaring yelling lion, tiger, leopard, laughter hyena, howling jackal, snarling bear, mingled hideous dissonance cries monkeys parrots; certain strange gurgles made Clare's heart, lover animals though he was, quiver, his blood creep. The instant, however, he woke sense he might something: he ran caravans. By time men, master all, fully roused far worse might follow attack bull, caught weapons hand, rushed repel animal For one two might proved fatal encounter, enraged beast entangled his horns spokes rim wheel. In terror might approaching behind, he struggling wildly extricate them. Peril upon peril! What contortions his mighty muscles he pulled wheel, carriage toppled over, every cage twisted wrenched bearings iron bars gave way! The results terrible ponder! This way that, every way once, he writhing pushing prising dragging. The elephant turned shafts slowly round see matter behind. If bull elephant yoked caravan came loggerheads, ruin inevitable. The master thought whether he better loose elephant bull yet entangled horns. With one blow his trunk he would break ruffian's back end affray! It good even, one knew how, loose wicked-looking horns: brute's struggles free dangerous far could horns themselves! While he hesitated, Clare came running up, Abdiel his heels ready hornet fly bull elephant, let his master speak word. But moment Clare saw bull's horns mixed spokes fellies wheel, glad suspicion flashed across him: old Nimrod's way! could Nimrod himself? If were, trouble good over! The suspicion became certainty instant woke. But never could Clare altogether forgive first sight recognizing his old friend. I believe hunger blame, Clare. The men stood animal, uncertain do, he struggled his horns, heaved tore wheel get it, roars howls inarticulate curses going time. The elephant must tired, stand nothing! For moment Clare could get near enough. He afraid call bull could see him: Nimrod might struggle more, order get him! Up rushed fellow, white rage running, bang middle spectators, shook knot asunder. It one two men Nimrod broken. He pitchfork his hands he proceeded level. Clare flung his weight him, threw his fork, shoved aside, got close maddened animal. It his past come again! How often he interfered protect Nimrod--and his would-be masters also! With instinctive, unconscious authority, he held his hand little crowd. “Leave alone,” he cried. “I know him; I manage him! Please interfere. He old friend mine.” They saw bull already still: he recognized boy's voice! They kept his furious attendant back, looked anxious hope Clare went animal. “Nimrod!” he whispered, laying hand one creature's horns, his cheek his neck. Nimrod stood like bull bronze. “I am going get horns out, Nimrod,” murmured Clare, laid hold firm grasp. “You must let I like, know, Nimrod!” His voice evidently soothed bull. By horns Clare turned his head one way, another, Nimrod resisting push pull. In moment he would clear, one already free. Holding latter, Clare turned bystanders. “You must not touch him,” he said, “or I will not answer him. And must not let either men there”--for second Nimrod's attendants time come up--“interfere me. They let go could not manage him. He cannot bear them; he break loose again, might quite another affair! Then he might distrust me!” The menagerie men turned, looking saw man pitchfork revenge his heart. They gave understand he must mind he about, would worse him. The man scowled said nothing. Clare gently released horn, kept his hold first, moving creature's head it, way that. A moment he turned his face company, scattered little. When inflamed eyes Nimrod came view, scattered wider. Clare still made bull feel his hand his horn, kept speaking gently lovingly. Nimrod eyed his enemies, plainly he counted them, he wished he lion he might eat well kill them. At time he seemed regard triumph, saying his big heart, “Ha! ha! know friend I had! Here he is, come nick time! I thought he would!” Clare proceeded untie ropes ring his nose. The man pitchfork interfered. “That wonnot do!” he said, laid his hand Clare's arm. “Would send ramping country, never hold him?” “It was not much good hold him--was now?” returned boy. “Where want take him?” “That is business,” answered man sulkily. “I fancy you will find it is mine!” returned Clare. “But he is! Take him.” The man hesitated. “Then leave manage him,” said Clare. A murmur approbation arose. The caravan people felt he knew he saying. They believed he power bull. While yet he untying first ropes animal's bleeding nostrils, Clare's fingers refused obedience, his eyes grew dim, he fell senseless bull's feet. “Do not tell Nimrod!” he murmured he fell. “Oh, explains it!” cried man pitchfork his mate. “He knows cursed brute!” For Clare hitherto spoken his name bull secret them. Neither sense perceive explanation lay bull's knowing Clare, Clare's knowing bull. They made haste lay hold ropes. Nimrod stood motionless, looking his friend, snuffing pale face, thorough-bred mongrel, Abdiel, kept licking continuously. Noses bull dog met without offence loved human countenance. But men let bull feel ropes, moment he would raging like demon. The men caravan, admiring Clare's influence animal his management him, grateful also he done them, hastened his help. When got take little brandy, he sat wan smile, presently fell sideways his elbow, ground again. “It is nothing,” he murmured; “it is I am rather hungry.” “Poor boy!” said woman, followed her brandy house-caravan, afraid might disappear occult directions, “when last feed?” She stood looking white face, almost fore-feet bull. “I piece bread yesterday afternoon, madam,” faltered Clare, trying look her. “Bless soul!” she cried, “who is murderin' you, child?” She thought he company two men; ill-treating him. “I cannot get work, madam, I do not want much eat. Now I think it, I believe gladness seeing old friend again, hunger, made feel queer once.” “Where is friend?” she asked, looking round assembly. “There he is!” answered Clare, putting his hand, stroking big nose right his face. “Could not rise now?” said woman, moment's silent regard him. “I will try, madam; I do not feel quite sure.” “I want come house, good square meal.” “If would kind, madam, let bit bread here! Nimrod would like leave him. He loves me, madam, I went away, he might troublesome. Those men never anything him: he does not like them! They have rough him, I do not doubt. Not I wonder that, he terrible beast people. They used say he never good anybody me. I suppose he knew I cared him!” His eyes closed again. The woman made haste get something. In minutes she returned basin broth. He took eagerly, look gratitude went her heart Before he tasted it, however, he set ground, broke half great piece bread she brought it, gave larger part his dog. Then he ate his broth, felt better many day. Some men said he could hungry give cur like much his dinner; evil thought enter mind woman. “You would better taking beast away,” said woman, time understood affair, two men. They silent, evidently disinclined another tussle. “You would better going,” she said again. “If anything happen animal yours, one get loose, devil would pay, who would it?” “They would better wait me, madam,” said Clare, rising. “I am ready!--They will not tell want take him, it is one, long I am him. He is friend!--Are not you, Nimrod? We will go together--will not we, Nimrod?” While he spoke, he undid ropes ring bull's nose. Gathering up, he handed politely one men, next moment sprang upon bull's back, behind his shoulders, leaning forward, stroked his horns neck. “Give dog, please,” he said. The owner menagerie Clare requested. All stood stared, half expecting see flung creature's back, trampled his hoofs. Even Nimrod, however, would easily unseated Clare, could ride anything he ever tried, tried everything strong enough carry him, pig upward. But Nimrod far wishing unseat his friend, hands legs began send toward road. “Are going way?” he asked, pointing. The men answered nod, sulky still. “Do not go men,” said woman, coming side bull, speaking low voice. “I do not like look them.” “Nimrod side, madam,” answered Clare. “They would never got home without me. They do not understand fellow-creatures.” “I am afraid understand fellow-creatures, call them, better kind!” “I think kind, madam. That know me, I want do.” “Stay us,” said woman coaxingly, still speaking low. “You will plenty fellow-creatures then!” “Thank you, madam, thousand times!” answered Clare, his face beaming; “but I could not leave poor Nimrod men mischief, killed it!” “You would plenty eat drink, som'at pocket!” persisted woman. “I know I everything I wanted!” answered Clare, “and I am thankful you, madam. But see there is always something, somehow, that is got done thing!” Here master came up. He thinking boy would great acquisition, guessed his wife about; he afraid she might promise much services ought cheap. Few scruple take advantage misfortune another get his service cheap. It economy hell. “I shall not feel safe till bull mile off!” he said. “Come along, Nimrod!” answered Clare, always ready responsive deed. Away went Nimrod, gentle lamb. Chapter XLIII. Across country. The two men came ease. No sooner Nimrod road, however, he began quicken his pace. He quickened fast, within minute trotting swiftly along. The men ran panting shouting behind. The shouted, faster Nimrod went. Ere long he sight, though Clare could hear cursing calling time. He endeavoured stop Nimrod, bull seemed made his mind he obeyed enough one day. He heed word Clare said him, kept swinging trot. Clare would jumped he sure proceeding would stop him; but, he would obey him, he feared lest, so, he might let loose country, saying mischief he might work. On hand, he felt sure he could restrain violence, though he might prevent his frolicking. He must therefore keep his seat. For miles Nimrod content highway, trotting beautifully, breaking canter. But he turned right angles middle road, cleared skirting fence like hunter, took bee-line across fields. Compelled sometimes abandon it, he showed great judgment choosing place get enclosure, cross natural obstruction. On he went, hedge hedge, field field, Clare began wonder people world got to. Then strange feeling gradually came him. Surely time he seen meadow he crossing! Was he asleep, dreaming jolly ride he Nimrod's back? What strong creature Nimrod was! Would he never tired? How oddly he felt! Were his senses going him? It like strangest mixture bad dream good! There seemed length room doubt mistake. Everything place! It plain Nimrod obstinate! The dear old fellow carrying back together many happy days! They nigh Mr. Goodenough's farm, making straight it! How strange was! he felt measureless distance it! But his wandering he taken many turns he heed, Nimrod come shortest way. Delight filled his heart thought seeing places his father mother seemed yet live. But instantly came thought Maly, drowned thought bitterness. Then he felt worthless place is, made dear gone. Father mother home--not house born in! They soon upon farm he abundance labour, abundance eat, abundance lowly friendship. Nimrod making his old stable. He weary now, breathing heavily, though spent. Was he dreaming golden age, Clare ever his beck call? Clare little inclination encounter people farm. He would indeed glad, little way off, get sight his friend master, farmer himself; gladly would he gone stable hope greeting old Jonathan; he would willingly meet “the mistress!” Nimrod take his old stall; he would tie up, flee place! The evening come, dusk he would escape unseen. When reached Nimrod's door, found closed; Clare, stiff enough time, slipped open it. Nimrod began paw stones, blow angry puffs his wounded nose. When Clare got door open, he saw, his confusion, vague dark bulk, another bull, Nimrod's stall! The roar simultaneously burst ferocious, went Nimrod's head charge. It terrible moment Clare: new bull fast head, and, unable turn his adversary, would gored death almost moment! He could let Nimrod guilty unfairness! And mistress would think he brought back purpose! He jumped horns his friend, making yield ground enough shutting door. He knew well, however, three doors one would keep Nimrod enemy. With his back he stood facing talking him, heard bull inside struggling get free. He stood two horned rages, chain plank betwixt one his back, he influence. A coward would escaped, left two bullies settle better right stall--not without blood, almost certainly without loss life, perhaps human well bovine. But Clare made stuff. Before he could get Nimrod away, bellowing brought farmer. All his men gone village; his wife home. “What is got brute?” he cried threshold, instantly began run, he saw gathering darkness darker shape he knew, roaring pawing door his old quarters, boy standing it, marvellous courage mortal danger. He understood Nimrod broken loose come back. But he came near enough recognize Clare, astonishment, something sacred astonishment, held dumb. Ever since unjust blow sent boy him, his heart aware little hollow remorse it. Now his former relations his adoptive father yet lived, came back upon him. He remembered dressed like little gentleman he always was--and he stood, gentle fearless creature, absolute rags! If his wife saw him! The farmer fear Nimrod his worst rages, he feared his wife her gentlest moods. Happily both, critical moment cooking supper arrived. “Clare!” he stammered. “Yes, sir,” returned Clare, laid hold Nimrod's horn. The animal yielded, turned away him. The farmer came nearer, put his arm round boy's neck. The boy rubbed his cheek arm. “I am sorry I struck you, Clare!” faltered big man. “Oh, never mind, sir! That long ago!” answered boy. “Tell you have getting on.” “Pretty well, sir! But I want tell first I am Nimrod. Only would better put somewhere I begin.” “It would,” agreed farmer; them, enticements pail water fresh-cut grass, got she would, hoped he would forget proximity usurper, and, soothing help his supper, go sleep. Then Clare told his story. Mr Goodenough afterward asseverated that, he known boy would lie, he would believed half it. “Come, Abdiel!” said Clare, moment he ended--and would started once. “Will not something long ride?” said farmer. Clare looked his clothes, laughed. The farmer knew he meant, ask house. “When anything eat?” he inquired. “I shall well till to-morrow,” answered Clare. “Then go, I am glad opportunity paying wages I owed you,” said farmer, putting his hand his pocket. “You gave food! That I worth!” protested Clare. “You worth that! I knew difference I another boy place! I wish I again!--But would not do, know! would not do!” he added hastily. With he succeeded pulling sovereign depth trowser-pocket, held Clare. It neither large wages greatly generous gift, seemed boy wealth enormous. He could help holding his hand, he ashamed open it. What giver regarded debt, receiver regarded gift. He stood his hand clenched. There combat inside him. “It is much!” he protested, looking sovereign almost fear. “I never much money life!” “You earned well,” said farmer magnanimously. The moral cramp forsook his hand. He took money hearty “Thank you, sir.” As he put his pocket, he felt corners carefully, lest hole. But his pockets half wear clothes inhabited. “Where going?” asked farmer. Clare mentioned small town whose neighbourhood he left caravans, said he thought people menagerie would like help beasts. The farmer shook his head. “It is respectable occupation!” he remarked. Clare understand him. “Do cheat?” he asked. “No; I do not suppose cheat worse anybody else. But are not respectable.” Had he known little more, Clare might asserted men menagerie least respectable almost farmer horse sell. But he knew next nothing wickedness, whence many man whose skull he brains enough fill three times, regarded simpleton. Clare thought everything honest honourable. When people said otherwise, he understand, continued act according he understood. A thousand dishonourable things done, largely approved, Clare would touched one his fingers: he could see nothing dishonourable wild beasts tame ones. If boy wants know sort thing I count thousand, I answer him--“The next thing asked do, inclined do--if doubt it, DO NOT DO IT.” That way know honourable thing dishonourable. Clare made attempt argue question farmer. He inquired nearest way town, went--the quicker he heard voice Mrs. Goodenough, calling her husband supper. Chapter XLIV. A third mother. Who ever sovereign first time his life, feel rich? Clare trudged along merrily, Abdiel shared his joy. They sleep doors nevertheless; time Clare knew boy, especially boy rags, must mind he asks change sovereign. In lee hay-mow, little loose hay, slept, Abdiel Clare's bosom, slept well. There much temptation lie long waking, companions early way. It yet morning came public house Clare his first last half-pint beer. The landlady stood newly opened door, her fists her sides, looking fresh world, lost thought possible her. Clare pulled his cap, bade her good morning he passed. Perhaps she knew she deserve politeness; anyhow she took Clare's impudence, came swooping upon him. He stopped waited her approach, perplexed it; unprepared box ear she dealt him, almost threw down. Her ankle instantly Abdiel's sharp teeth. She gave frightful screech, Clare, coming himself, though still stupid her blow his surprise, called dog. The woman limped raging house, Clare thought prudent go his way. He talked severely Abdiel went; though dog could understand much, I doubt he understood lecture. For Abdiel one few, even among dogs, defence master friend inborn, instinctive duty; strong temptation even poor chance sense duty dog. It night entered town. They already weary pair far sounds brass band menagerie, mostly made attendants animals, first entered ears. The marketing over; band issuing last invitation merry-makers walk see strange sights; notes dying close, wayfarers arrived foot steps leading platform musicians stood. Clare ascended, Abdiel crept him. At table small curtained recess platform, sat mistress receive money entered. Clare laid his sovereign her. She took without looking him, she looked doubtfully. She threw her table. It would ring. She bit her white teeth, looked again; length gave glance person offered it. Her dull lamp flickered puffs night-wind, she recognize Clare. She saw white-faced, ragged boy, threw back his sovereign. “Will not pass,” she said decision, unmingled contempt. She sat receipt money, many men women cease ladies gentlemen. Clare first understand. He stood motionless and, second time day, bewildered. How could money money? “'Are not got sixpence?” she asked. “No, madam,” answered Clare. “I have not sixpence many day.” The moment he spoke, woman looked sharply face, knew him. “Drat stupid eyes!” she said fervently. “That I should not ha' known you! Walk in, walk in. Go please, please. You are right welcome.--Where get sov.?” “From Farmer Goodenough.” “Good enough, I hope, take advantage innocent prince! Was taking home bull?” “No, madam. I did not take bull home. The bull took old home used together. He did not want new one!” “Well, never mind now. Give sovereign. I will talk by. Go in, show 'ill over. Look dog, though. We do not like dogs. He must not go in.” “I will send right outside, wish it, madam.” “I do.--But he stay out?” “He will, madam.” Clare took Abdiel, setting top steps, told go wait. Abdiel went hopping down, like dirty little white cataract hook, turned steps, deposited his master call him. Chapter XLV. The menagerie. A strange smell Clare's nostrils, he went steps inside, grew stronger. He dislike it; set thinking differ domestic animals. He presently midst vision attractive boys, ever looked upon intelligent wonder he; Clare read re-read every book animals upon he could lay his hands. He great power remembering he read; he never let description glide away outside his eyes, always put inside his thinking place. What pictures descriptions, he seemed know, he looked around him, every animal his eyes fell. The area means crowded. There many visitors day, late. He could see cages formed sides enclosure. Many creatures seemed restless, sleepy: night waking time them. How great roaming, hunting cat go sleep little cube darkness! “Oh,” thought Clare, “how gladly would I help bear it! I could bear somebody near kind me!” He begun feel quiet happiness he accustomed he think much it, his _given_ him. He begun see come itself, love his father mother. He yet learn given give Father fathers mothers. But he beginning prize every least kindness shown him. This re-acted his desire make happiness greater pain less everywhere him. He little chance much people, he thought; he knew things animals, perhaps necessary know others able something too! Thoughts like passing his mind, his gaze wandering hither thither shifting shapes, his eyes rested tenant one cages, his heart immediately grew sore, he seemed unable lift his head. He big animal, alone his prison, blackish colour, awkward appearance. He went nearer, found he big ring his nose like Nimrod. But ring fastened strong chain, chain bolted floor cage, iron covered boards, turn covered thick sheet lead. The chain short held poor creature's head within foot floor. He could lift higher, move farther either side; he kept moving constantly. It pitiful sight, Clare went nearer still, drawn far compassion, indeed sympathy, curiosity. He terrible brute, big grizzly bear, ugly repulsiveness. The snarling scorn, sneering, lip-writhing hate demoniacal grin he received boy, hideous; rattling, pebble-jarring growl came his devilish throat loathing embodied. What spirits worse get creatures virtue likeness them! One day written, perhaps, history animals different attempted mere master zoology. Clare spoke beast again, unvaryingly answered odious snarl, curling his lip his nose-ring. It seemed express imagined delight tearing limb limb. “Poor fellow!” said Clare, “how he good-tempered torturing ring chain! His unalterable position must make his every bone ache!” But his nose set free, raging-bear-struggle get nearest his fellow-prisoners would ensued, must soon torn shreds partition them. For he beast-bedlamite, animal volcano, furnace death, incarnate paroxysm wrath. The inspiration creature, far one could see, pure hate. The boy turned aside quivering heart--sore grizzly's nose, sorer still grizzly he unfriendly. Right opposite, creature far differing disposition seemed casting defiance ills life. As he turned sad despair grizzly, Clare caught sight his pranks, hastened across area. The creature kept bounding side side his cage, agile frolicsome kitten. But light poor, Clare could even conjecture cat-kinds he belonged. When he came near his cage, he saw he yellowish like lion, thought perhaps he might young lion. He mane. Clare judged four feet length without tail--or perhaps four half. A little way real lion--a young one, true, quite grown, thin ruffy mane, lordly carriage gaze. It he whose roar challenged Nimrod, giving topmost flutter flame his wrath. But Clare taken frolicsome creature him, he gave glance grand one he walked his prison, turned merry one disporting alone, seemed find pleasure life great games companions one saw himself. For minutes he stood regarding gladness God's creature. A wild thing woods plains, he made bars floor roof his cage. No one careless liberty could make bounds those; yet he joyous closest imprisonment! His liberty gone, his freedom contracted cubic feet, his space diminished almost mould his body, great wild philosopher created his liberty, made his love it. Like live, erratic shuttle he went fro, unweaving, unravelling, unwinding, drawing knot confinement, flinging out, radiating spreading breathing space directions, multitudinous motion disentanglement! Space gone him, space abstract replace it! He would slave condition! Space unconditioned his! For liberty lie space, his soul. Room poor out-aide symbol his inward freedom! He would spin out, he would weave, he would unroll essential liberty spiritual space! His mind kingdom was. Not grumble, snarl! He left discontent men, build prisons withal. A proud man everything he longs for, man be, slave; creature glad creator would free, he free soul. Prison bars could touch whose virtue he would free! The germ thinking mind Clare he stood gazed; he told story, ripeness came thus, nearly thus, his lips; he thought much lonely places. As he gazed sympathized, awoke within strange consciousness reader must, one time another, known--of point remembering something. It memory came, memory memory--the shadow memory gone, trying come behind veil--a sense known something. It gave another aspect blessed creature him. The creature seemed moment belong together another time. Could he seen animal before? He think so! He could never visited menagerie forgotten it! If he known creature, his after-reading would recalled it, he would know now! He could tell lion tiger leopard, although he seemed know he never seen one them; he could tell animal, yet--and yet!--what it? The feeling lasted scarce instant, went farther. No memory came him. The foiled expectation he had. The reasoning helped obliterate shape feeling itself. He could even recall thing felt; he could remember there. It shadow shadow dream--a yet vaguer memory thinnest presences first tantalized him. We remember cannot recall. Perhaps rousing odd, fantastic feeling favoured slumber beginning encroach tody brain. While he stood looking one creature, wonderful creatures began get mixed together, he thought better go search field sleep, he might mow little his use. He said good-night great, gentle, jubilant cat, turned unwillingly, went steps. Almost every spectator gone. At top he turned last look, could distinguish nothing except dim form young lion, he thought him, still gamboling presence his maker. He thought see mistress menagerie, she longer her curtained box. He went deserted platform, steps. Abdiel already foot he reached it, wagging his weary little tail. They set look shelter. Their search, however, much vain, last returned lay one wagons, hard ground public square. Sleeping often doors, he never yet taken cold. Chapter XLVI. The angel wild beasts. When Clare looked he saw nothing sky. They dragged caravan him, he moved. Abdiel indeed waked first pull, lain still mouse--ready rouse his master, instant necessary. Clare saw sky, he saw something else him, better sky--the face Mrs. Halliwell, mistress menagerie. In it, she stood looking him, compassion, mingled self-reproach. Clare jumped up, saying, “Good morning, madam!” He yet half awake, staggered sleep. “My poor boy!” answered woman, “I sent sleep cold earth, sovereign pocket! I made sure would come ask it! You are innocent go world without mother!” She turned her face away. “But, madam, know I could not offered anybody,” said Clare. “It was not good!--Besides, I knew that,” he went on, finding she reply, “there nobody I dared offer to: would said I stole it--because I am shabby!” he added, looking his rags. “But are not clothes, madam--is it?” Getting better her feelings moment, she turned her face said,-- “It fault! The sov. good one. It is cracked! I ought known, changed you. Then would well!” “I do not think would made difference, madam. We would rather sleep ground bed might not clean--would not we, Abby?” The dog gave short little bark, he always his master addressed his name.--“But I am glad!” Clare went on. “I sure Mr. Goodenough thought sovereign right he gave me!--Were ever disappointed sovereign, madam?” “I oftener disappointed owed  them!” she answered. “But think snug bed, an' sleepin' i' dark night! I cannot abide thought it!” “Do not let trouble you, madam; we are used it. Are not we, Abby?” “Then ought not be! and, please God, shall more! But come along breakfast We do not start till last.” “Please, madam, may Abdiel come too?” “In course! 'Love me, love dog!' Are not right?” “Yes, madam; people like dogs worse boys.” “A good deal depends dog. When folk brings dogs bad childern, I want neither me. But dog's well-behaved dog. Still, he must learn come sight animals.” “He learn, madam!--Abdiel, lie down, do not come till I call you.” At word, dog dropped, lay. The house-caravan stood little way off, drawn aside began break up. They ascended steps behind, entered enchanting little room. It muslin curtains windows, small stove could see bright red coals. On stove stood coffee-pot covered dish. How nice warm place felt, nearly shelterless night! The breakfast-things still table. Mr. Halliwell his breakfast, Mrs. Halliwell would eat she found boy. She unhappy night. Her husband assured her sovereign good one, boy told her he money sovereign! She little knew seldom he fared better night! When he got among hay straw, luxury. They sat breakfast, good woman soon confirmed notion boy gentleman. “Call dog now,” she said, “an' let us see he will come!” “May I whistle, madam?” “Why not!--But he hear you?” “He sharp ears, madam.” Clare gave low, peculiar whistle. In second two, heard anxious little whine door. Clare made haste open it. There stood Abdiel, words his eyes, plain almost he spoke them--“Did call, sir?” The woman caught held her bosom. “You blessed little thing!” she said. And surely blessing had, obey. Clare heard felt horses put-to, hostess Scythian house rise, he went his breakfast. When motion, easy eat nicely, he managed well. By time he done, left town behind them. He wanted help Mrs. Halliwell breakfast-things, whether she feared he would break them, think masculine work, she would allow him. Nothing said his going them; she taken granted. Clare began think perhaps he ought take his leave: nothing do! He Abdiel ought least get walk, instead burdening poor horses weight, well rested, good breakfast! But he said Mrs. Halliwell, she told she must little talk first, formally proposed he enter service, whatever he fit menagerie. “You are frightened beasts, you?” she said. “Oh no, madam; I love them!” answered Clare. “But sure Mr. Halliwell thinks I could use?” “Do not think could?” asked Mrs. Halliwell. “I know I could, madam; I like take he sorry me!” “You innocent! People hurry help neighbours. My husband's good man going; do not mean he would take boy nobody else would him. A fool woman might--I will not say; man I ever knew. No, no! He saw way managed bull!--a far unreasonable creature with!” “Ah! do not know Nimrod, madam!” “I do not, an' I do not want to!--Such wild animals ought put caravans!” she added, laugh. “Well, madam,” said Clare, “if Mr. Halliwell one mind, nothing would please much serve beasts. But I like sure it, husband wife one mind--well, uncomfortable!” Thereupon he told her he stood farmer his wife; she led his whole story--not unaccompanied tears part his deliverer, she tender-souled well generous friendly woman. In her heart she rejoiced think boy's sufferings would end; thenceforward she was, he always called her, his third mother. “My poor, ill-used child!” she said. “But I will mother you--if you will me!” “You would not mind I thought rather often two mothers, madam--would you?” he said. “God forbid, boy!” she answered. “If I real mother, would I flesh blood ungrateful? Should I proud loving nobody me? That is like worst beasts: love none little ones--and till they are tired trouble them!” “Thank you! Then I son Clare, please, madam.” The next time stopped, she made her husband come her caravan, she would everything arranged. When her husband boy would left his wages undetermined, she would hear it, insisted much week fixed begin with. She doubt, she said, her husband would soon ready enough raise his wages; he must his food five shillings week now, Mr. Halliwell must advance money get decent clothes: he might keep wages till clothes paid for! Everything she wished agreed her husband, next town, Clare's new mother saw dressed her satisfaction, his own. She would his holiday clothes better his present part life required, she would let his sovereign go toward paying them: she would keep ready case he might want it! Her eyes followed anxious pride--as she his mother fact she truth. He plenty do. The favour his mother saved kind work, neither he desire should. Every morning he took his share cleaning cages, setting water beasts, food birds creatures took pleased. At proper intervals he fed many he might animals stated times meals; found advantage facilitating his friendly approaches them. He helped horses also--with whose harness ways he already familiar. In short time he known friend every civilized animal caravans. He required him, more. Not everyone course right give orders, Clare particular wanted him, what. He far glad work look gift askance. He make trouble ought none, saying, spirit slave, “It is place.” He many things he might disputed, he never thought disputing them. Thus, others, he saved great deal time, avoided much annoyance much quarrelling. Thus also he gained many friends. Chapter XLVII. Glum Gunn. He one enemy, he make such: he one nature. For he different Clare he disliked moment he saw him, took day ripen his dislike hatred. Like Mr. Maidstone, he found innocent fearlessness Clare's expression repulsive. His fingers twitched, he said, twist sheep-nose him. Unhappily Clare, he consequence menagerie, money concern. He half-brother proprietor, unlike he might drop blood source. An ill-tempered, imperious man, he would hurt his way, he merest slave he fancied. When man _will_ thing, right wrong, man slave thing--the meanest slaves, willing one. He terror men beneath him, heeding man his brother--and he knew “he would stand nonsense.” To his sister-in-law he civil: she his brother's wife, his brother proud her! Also he knew she perfect her part business. So reason stand well he might her! Clare suspicion he disliked him. It took days indeed discover even he love him--notwithstanding bilious eye which, owner idle, kept constantly following him. And idle he often was, laziness, love ordering about, looking superior. It natural man also cruel. There find existence pleasant proportion make others miserable. He liking animals, regarding property never right;--as God would make anything live without thereby giving rights! To Glum Gunn, he commonly called behind his back, animals worth much money sell, much show. Yet he prided he great influence well power them, occult superiority made lord. It merely phase vulgarest self-conceit. He posed lion-tamer! He never tamed lion, creature else, his life; he wild thing safe within iron bars, he “let know his master!” By terror his whip, means far worse, he compelled obedience. The grizzly alone, larger animals, he never interfered with. From first he received Clare's “_Good-morning, sir_,” silent stare; boy last, thinking he like greeted, gave salutation. This roused Gunn's anger increased his hate. But indeed boy petted his sister-in-law, would odious him; boy whatever would found hard master. Clare protected man's unreadiness words his brother, always took his wife's part; tyrant soon learned he might venture far. For he saw, boy's ready smile, he never resented anything, brute, boys would done, attributed cowardice; he learned he never carried tales his sister, which, instead admiring his reticence, he took advantage, set making life bitter him. It time he began succeed, Clare hard annoy. Patient, right ready pleased, he could hardly imagine offence intended; thought unthinkable Clare's nature; he let evil pass forgotten never been. Once, he ran along heavy pail water, Gunn shot his foot threw down: he rose cut his forehead, smile his lips. He carried mark pail long he carried his body, long he believed he tripped up. Had proved time, he would taken joke, intending hurt. He see lurid smile man's face he turned away, smile devilish delight discomfiture hated fellow-creature. Gunn put dirtiest work--only find trouble him: boy rare gentleman--unwilling another he might less disagreeable. I two three times heard say man right require another thing he would think degrading himself. He said he learned New Testament. “But,” he said, “nothing God made necessary, possibly degrading. It may thing man, time, do, cannot degrading.” The boy take his turn several acting showman gazing crowd, part fell oftenest. Each his way filling office. One would repeat his information like lesson he interested, expected one else interested. Another made clown exhibition, joked much well he could. Gunn delighted telling many lies he dared: he must suspected making fools his audience! Clare, books knew far others concerning creatures wild state, who, watching he loved them, already noted things none others observed, fast learning more, talked spectators his sincere warm interest, giving his treasure things new old--things he read, things he discovered. Group group simple country people would listen intently he led round, eager every word; peg hang hate upon, even success noted evil eye Glum Gunn. Almost anything served increase his malignity. Whether grew faster he yet found wider outlet it, I cannot tell. At last, however, tyrant learned inflict keenest pain tender-hearted boy, counting greater idiot he could “be got at,” he phrased it, promising much enjoyment discovery. But he know--how he know--what love may compel! Chapter XLVIII. The puma. I need hardly say time beasts friendliness Clare little usual amount feeling. But one him--I prefer _who_ _which_ certain animals--a real friendship begun once, grown ripened rapidly till strong sides. Clare's new friend--and companion much circumstance permitted--was whose lonely gambols much attracted night he first entered menagerie. The animal, Clare taken young lion--without far wrong, he often called American lion--was puma, couguar, peculiar America, relation jaguar, also American, little similar lion tiger. But jaguar wicked beast tiger, puma possesses, relation man, far fabulous generosity lion. Like every good creature he misunderstood slandered, known him, He doubtless degenerated districts, wild animal must gradually disappear human, he cannot help becoming process less friendly humanity; essential distinctive characteristic puma his love human being--a love persistent, devoted, long-suffering. Between animal Clare, surprising friendship blossomed. He stroked paw Indian lion first morning, day he stroking cheek puma; he could grizzly end month feed little sly, get thanks growl worse hate. There men would soonest tear benefactors, loathing cannot get them. I suspect mysterious way Glum Gunn bear brothers. With elephant Clare he pleased--never pleasing anything pleasing elephant. They came town exhibited every day week, friendship Clare puma reached perfection. One night boy could sleep, drawn his love, went among cages see his fellow-creatures getting time darkness. There light enough small moon show dim outlines cages, motion without form moving animal. The puma, his solitary yet joyous gymnastics, celebrating rites freedom according his custom. When Clare entered, he made peculiar purring noise, ceased his amusement--a game ball, ball. Clare went him, began usual stroke face nose; whereupon puma began lick his hand his dry rough tongue. Clare wondered could nice dry thing always his mouth, pity God given him. He his arm bars cage, his face pressed close them, suddenly face animal rubbing could reach his. The end was, Clare drew aside bolt cage-door, got beside puma. The creature's gladness even greater he found friend his kind. Noses cheeks heads rubbed together; tongue licked, hand stroked scratched. Then began frolic, played long time, puma jumping Clare, Clare, afraid jump lest he make noise, tumbling puma. The boy length went fast asleep; morning found creature lying his head across his body, wide awake motionless, guarding disturbance. Nobody stirring; Clare, would friendship exposed every comment, crept quietly cage, went his bed. The next night, soon place quiet, Clare went down, another game puma. Before sport over, he begun teach tricks he taught Abdiel; he could much fear making noise alarming keeper. The thing took place, often possible, weeks, Clare came much confidence, far least good intention concerned, puma Abdiel. If he could cage, dear beast might little taste old liberty! But certain puma would behave others, he could control him, he felt he right release him. Now he would fall asleep cage, whereupon puma would always lie close beside him. Whether puma slept, I know. On one occasion, Clare started his feet half-awake, roused terrific roar. Right end stood couguar, flattening his front bars cage, he clawed furiously, snarling spitting yelling like huge cat he was, every individual hair end, his eyes like green lightning. Clatter, clatter, went his great feet iron, he tore bar that, get something dim open space. It dark Clare see thus infuriated him, his ear discovered his eye could not. For then, woven mad noise wild creature, others beginning join, he heard modest whimper tame one--Abdiel, whose small person, gladly he would “naught while,” huge indignation levelled. Must deeper ground enmity dogs cats evil human incitement? Their antipathy explained history animals I said must one day written. Clare taken much pains make Abdiel understand he intrude his presence desired--that show him, thought dog learned perfectly never pretence, reason, he go steps, however often he saw his master go down. This prohibition great trial Abdiel's loving heart, night trial great his loving will. When Clare left him, he thought he taken his usual pains shutting small cage he made use occasions, lest he might tempted think, he saw nobody about, law longer applied. But he careful enough; Abdiel, sniffing finding his door unfastened, interpreted fact sign he might follow his master. Hence coil. For pumas--whereby also must hang explanation book zoology, intense hatred dogs. Tame cubhood, never get antipathy them. With pumas “Love you, hate dog.” In present case could individual jealousy, passion beasts birds capable, Pummy never seen Abby before. There may puma inborn jealousy dogs, race favoured pumas man yet love perhaps passionately. As soon Clare saw matter was, he slipped cage, catching obnoxious offender--where he stood wagging his entire body self-informed tail--sped his room, gave serious talking-to. The puma quiet moment dog his sight. Doubtless he regarded Clare his champion distress, blessed removal his soul hated. But, alas, mischief already afoot! Gunn, waked roaring, came flying his whip, remnants poor Pummy's excitement enough betray eyes tamer caged animals. Clare would recognized roar individual trouble; Glum Gunn little knowledge even race. He counted couguar coward, he showed resentment. A man may strike wound him, he make retaliation; he even let man go kill him, make defence beyond moans tears. But Gunn knew nothing facts; he knew puma would touch _him_. He aware he turned two arena show, puma would kill grizzly; country, puma persecutes jaguar he hated like himself, friend man: Gauchos Pampas call “The Christians' Friend.” Gunn even know horse puma's favourite food: he leap back horse full speed, his paws break his neck he runs, come rolling heap. Neither he know that, submissive man--as maker said him, “Slay creatures, anointed harm,”--he could yet upon occasion provoked punish though kill him. Glum Gunn rushed across area, jumped cage puma, began belabouring his whip. The beast whimpered wept, brute belaboured him. Clare heard changed cry his friend, came swooping like guardian angel he was. When he saw patient creature his haunches like dog, accepting Gunn's brutality without attempt escape it--except, indeed, dodging blows his head cleverly ruffian could hit it--he bounded cage, wild anger pity. But Gunn stood his back door it, he reduced entreaty. “Oh, sir! sir!” he cried, voice full tears; “it fault! Abby came look me, I did not know Pummy disliked dogs!” “Do tell me, rascal, among hanimals I supposed bed?” “Yes, sir, I was. I did not know harm. I was not anything wrong.” “Hold jaw! What _was_ doing?” “I cage puma.” “You was! You impudence tell face! I will teach you, cotton-face! milk-pudding! go corrupting hanimals making worth salt!” He swung cage-door fury, Clare, his friend danger, would run. The wretch seized collar, began lash he lashing puma. Happily he close give stinging blows. With first hiss thong, came tearing screech puma, he flung fury upon door his cage. Gunn his wrath Clare forgotten bolt it. Dragging his claws, he found unfastened, pulled open, like huge she will mortar, shot Gunn. Down he went. For one moment puma stood him, swinging his tail great sweeps, looking him, doubtless indignation. Then Clare could lay hold him, Clare fallen onset, Pummy turned scornful back upon his enemy, walking away slow, careless stride, he worth thinking more, leaped his cage, lay down. The thing passed swiftly Clare see touch man his paw, thought he thrown his weight. The beast, however, left brute without lesson he needed; he given one little pat side head. Gunn rose staggering. The skin something torn his cheek temple almost chin, blood streaming. Clare hastened help him, he flung aside, muttering oath, “I will make pay this!” went out, holding his head hands. Clare went shot bolt cage. Pummy sprang up. His tail swift-shifting feet showed eager expectation romp. He already forgotten curling lash terrible whip! But Clare bade good-night kiss bars. Glum Gunn kept his bed week. When length he appeared, demonstration best art surgeon town, he beautiful look upon. To end his evil earthly days he bore ugly scar; neither his heart his temper better his well deserved punishment. Mrs. Halliwell questioned Clare whole thing, inquiring his answers suggested new directions. Her catechism ended partial discovery Gunn's behaviour her _protegé_, she loved he silent concerning it. She stood perturbed. One moment her face flushed anger, next turned pale apprehension. She bit her lip, tears came her eyes. “Never mind, mother,” said Clare, saw reason emotion; “I am afraid him.” “I know you are not, sonny,” she answered; “but do not make less afraid you. He is bad man, brother-in-law mine! I fear he will mischief. I am afraid I wrong taking you! I ought done I could without keeping me. We cannot get rid he is got money business. Not he is part owner--I do not mean that! If we would got money handy, we would pay once!” “I do not care myself,” said Clare. “I do not mean I like kicked, do not make miserable. What I cannot bear see cruel beasts. I love beasts, mother--even cross old Grizzly.--But Mr. Gunn do not meddle much _him_!” “He respects his ugly sort!” answered Mrs. Halliwell, laugh. For plain Clare master kept eye his brother, puma. On one occasion he told assembled staff he would tyranny: every one knew among one tyrant. Gunn saw his brother awake watching: check his conduct, he hated Clare worse. For puma, he afraid now, went his cage. With rest men Clare favourite, knew true helpful, constantly same: could always depend him! Abdiel shared favour shown his master. They said dog beauty, hair breeding, he almost human creature, he was not good one, shame kick him. Chapter XLIX. Glum Gunn's revenge. They opened menagerie certain large town. It evening-exhibition, Clare going his round his wand office, pointing different animals, telling he thought would interest his hearers, another attendant, friendly all, came behind him, whispered Glum Gunn got hold Abby, must going dog mischief. Clare instantly gave his wand, bolted crowd, reproaching that, Abby seemed restless, he shut up: he shut up, Gunn would got hold him! When he reached top steps, Gunn platform, addressing crowd. It plain boy, time inexperienced, he drinking, and, though drunk, taken enough rouse worst him. He poor dog scruff neck, holding arm's-length. Abdiel picture wretchedness. Except colour size, he like flea like sort dog--with his hind legs drawn up, his tail tucked tight them, his back-bone curved half circle. In uncomfortable plight, tyrant making burlesque speech him. “Here see, ladies gentlemen,” he said, resuming little, fresh spectators act joining border crowd, “as I already honour informing you, one extraordinary productions vegetable kingdom. It unnatural be, I see are, inclined dispute assertion. I am, indeed, far surprised scepticism; strangeness phenomenon consists his appearance neither less dog. But I honour leaving astonishment, I shall convinced he reality nothing vegetable. I would plainly call he is--a cucumber, I fear statement would demand powers credence, evidently limited, could well afford. But I have, eyes, cut throat vegetable, extremely like ugly mongrel, eyes see single drop blood follow knife, satisfied truth assertion; and, gazed specimen Nature's jugglery, will, I hope, honour walk behold yet greater wonders within.” He ceased, set getting his knife his pocket. Clare, watching Gunn's every motion, partially sheltered behind side doorway. One know Gunn, might well taken thing practical joke, innocent foolish, pretended conclusion would met comical frustration, probably dog's escape; Clare saw his friend mortal peril. With eye one used wild animals unexpectedness sudden motions, he stood following every movement Gunn's hands, ready anticipate whatever action might indicate approach: he watched like razor-clawed lynx. While Gunn held Abdiel he did, he could seriously injure him; although he hurting dreadfully, his hate-possessed fingers, like live, writhing vice, worrying squeezing skin his poor little neck, yet better wait right moment. When he saw arm held dog drawn in, hand move man's pocket, he knew moment more, theatrical cry dismay murderer, body his friend would dashed ground, his head half off, blood streaming his neck. They mostly rather vulgar people stood platform, capable delighted end joke poor without catastrophe. The wretch stooped little, slightly relaxed his hold dog open his knife, bound doubled force blow Clare struck side head. He choice hit him, his fist fell spot lately torn claws Pummy. The tyrant fell, lay moment stunned. Abdiel flung his master, exultant finding thing joke he trying vain believe it. Clare caught dashed steps, one instant Glum Gunn rose, cursing furiously. Clare charged crowd: time civil! Abdiel's life imminent danger! That his predicament occur him. His sudden rush took crowd surprise, next caravans would, I fear, stopped him. Some started follow him, portion crowd he came next, better sort, closed behind him. There women men took part boy loved his dog. “What a-shovin' at?” bawled huge country-man, Gunn made cannon he rushed pursuit. “Aw'll knock 'ee flat--aw wull! Let little un an's dawg aloan! Aw un! Hit an'ye choose--aw doan't objec'!” Every attempt Gunn made pass him, man pushed his great body his way, he soon saw chance overtaking Clara The wings Hate swift, swift rescuing Love; Help far readier run Love Hate. Chapter L. Clare seeks help. Clare got crowd, soon beyond sight anyone knew taken place, his heart exulting he saved his friend trusted him. He hurried on, heedless whither, his thought get away man would murder Abby; town long way behind ere question supper shelter presented itself. This grown strange thought, long caravan house warmth plenty. But comfort disadvantages; Clare discovered, dismay, he quite free ere luxurious life last weeks began: Abby he would less able, he feared, bear hunger cold. It start afresh, however, grow abler! One consolation was, that, felt hunger more, could much harm: capital go upon. He must gather cowardice instead courage season prosperity! He glad Abdiel, though, he grew his clothes: he left his warmest behind him. It made ashamed find regretting his clothes he lost mother! Then pleased think she his sovereign, wages due since his clothes paid for. They would help give Glum Gunn his own, set beasts free him! Then he would go back spend his life his mother Pummy! Poor Pummy! But though Gunn hated him, he afraid too; his fear would creature's protection! He imagined his might cowed puma, animal's human gentleness made submissive man: he knew better now! Clare clasped Abdiel his bosom, trudged on. They gone miles ere occurred might comfortable carried his individual burden. He set Abdiel down, dog ran vibrating pleasure. Clare felt set down, tail wag. It late autumn: could without supper, must possible find shelter! A farm-house came sight. It recalled vividly Clare's early experiences houselessness, beasts caravans, his mother Glum Gunn, grew hazy distant, old time drew near he seemed waked long dream. They back old misery--a misery which, however, his heart pierced pangs innocent creatures unable unwilling defend natural guardian! It long he learned weeks Gunn unable hurt one them; his drinking, his late wound, blow Clare given him, brought severe attack erysipelas. When reached farm-yard, Clare knew aspect things cattle housed horses suppered. He crept unseen one cow-houses: bodies breath animals would keep warm! How sweet smell seemed caravans! An empty stall him, like chamber prepared his need. He gathered straws cows, taking care one less comfortable, spread Abby thin couch. But excitement happened, his wonder would come next, hunger begun gnaw him, Clare could sleep. And he lay awake, thoughts came him. Whence thoughts come us? Of one thing I sure--that I make even send thoughts. If greater one think us, think anything. Then wonder night! How works compelling people think! Surely somehow God comes nearer night! Clare began think helpless he was. He thinking food warmth, things beings he loved. It seemed hard he could love, nothing more. There his mother! he could nothing deliver her villainous brother-in-law! There Pummy, exposed cruelty evil man! he could nothing him! There Maly! he could nothing her--nothing make her father mother glad her dome angels! Was possible he really could nothing? Then came thought people used say prayers days he went his mother church. He taught say prayers himself, begun forget bed kneel beside. What saying prayers mean? In Bible-stories people prayed trouble could help themselves! Did matter he church bedside? Surely one place must good another, true God everywhere! Surely he could hear wherever he spoke! Neither could necessity speaking loud! God would hear, however low he spoke! Then he remembered God knew thoughts his creatures: so, he might think prayer him; need words! From moment conclusion, Clare began pray God. And he prayed right kind prayer; is, his prayers real prayers; he asked he wanted. To say prayers asking God things care about, mock him. When ask something want, may thing God care give us; he likes us speak it. If good us, he give us; good, he give us, would hurt us. But Clare asked God he always doing: his prayer God would good his mothers, his two fathers, Mr. Halliwell, Maly, Sarah, his baby, Tommy--and poor Pummy, would, Glum Gunn beat him, help bear blows, mind much. He ended something like this: “God, I cannot anything anybody! I wish I could! You get near them, God: please something good every one I cannot. I think I could go sleep now, I sure listened!” Having thus cast his cares God, he go sleep; woke morning ready new day arrived his waking. Chapter LI. Clare true master. It would take big book tell things interest happened Clare next weeks. They would mainly he found refuge, he Abdiel got things eat. Verily live fat land. Now benevolent person, seeing evident want, would contrive job order pay it: one place, although need him, certain good people gave ten days' work gardener, dismissed twenty shillings his pocket. One way another, Clare Abdiel die hunger cold. That summary history good many weeks. One night slept common, lee gypsy tent, contrived get away morning without seen. For Clare feared might offer something stolen, hunger might persuade ask questions. Many respectable people laugh idea boy particular. Such immeasurably pitied Clare. No one could hard boy circumstances took offered him, he would honest Clare--though he might well honest would laugh him. Another time he went large house, see he might get job. He found place, time least, abandoned: I suppose persons charge deserted post make holiday. He lingered evening fell, got Abdiel glass frame kitchen-garden. But glass close Clare feared breaking it; got again, lay bench she would potting plants. Clare waked morning sound cuff side head. He got bench, took Abdiel, coming himself, said gardener stood righteous indignation, “I am much obliged bedroom, sir. It cold last night.” His words respectful manner mollified gardener little. “You business here!” he returned. “I know that, sir; boy do?” answered Clare. “I was not hurting anything, cold might died slept doors.” “That is business mine!” “But mine,” rejoined Clare; “--except think boy cannot get work ought commit suicide. If he must not that, he cannot always help people houses do not like!” The gardener bad sort fellow, perceived truth boy said. “That is always story!” he replied, however. “Cannot get work! No idle boy ever could get work! I know sort you--well!” “Would mind giving chance?” returned Clare eagerly. “I would not ask much wages.” “You would not, asked worth!” “We would worth victuals anyhow!” answered Clare, always counted dog. “Who is we?” asked man. “Be hundred you?” “No; two. Only Abdiel here!” “Oh, beast mongrel?” The gardener made stride seize dog. Clare bounded him. The man burst mocking laugh. “He is good dog, indeed, sir!” said Clare. “You will give sack I give job.” “We are old friends, sir; cannot parted!” “I thought much!” cried gardener. “They are always ready work, an' hungry! But part mangy dog? Not they! Hard work good wages are not nowhere beside mongrel pup! Get out! Do not I know whole ugly bilin' ye!” Clare turned away gentle good-morning, man get his heart matter two days, departed, hugging Abdiel. He often cold always hungry, his life anything dull. The man know his next meal come from, seldom afflicted ennui. That monopoly enviable nothing do, everything money get them. A foolish west-end life immeasurably discomfort street Arab. The ordinary beggar, tolerable health, finds far enjoyment fashionable ladies. Thus Clare went wandering long, seeking work, finding next none--all time upheld feeling something waiting somewhere, he every day drawing nearer it. Not yet he lost heart. In virtue unselfishness lack resentment, he strong. Not he she would tear himself, he pitied his condition. Chapter LII. Miss Tempest. Without knowing it, he approaching sea. Walking along chain downs, he saw suddenly top one them, first time his memory though his life, sea--a pale blue cloud, appeared, far horizon, two low hills. The sight it, although he first know was, brought strange inexplicable feeling dolorous pleasure. For he could account. It faintest revival obliterated impression something familiar his childhood, lying somewhere deeper memory, blank regard it. But feeling sight awoke him. The pale blue cloud bore look eternal, seemed place God live in--the solemn, stirless region calm late he first begun reality pray, kept his abode. The hungry, worn, tattered boy, nothing call his great hope little dog, fell his bare knees hard road, stretched his hands ecstasy toward low cloud. The far-off ringing tramp horse's feet aroused him. He rose light athlete, great hope grown twice former size, hunger forgotten. The blue cloud kept sight, he knew sea he saw, though moment knowledge came he could told. The track leading toward one principal southern ports. By time he thin; he brown cheeks clear eyes, and, save suffering immediately hunger, felt perfectly well. Hunger sad thing notwithstanding deep wholesomeness; immeasurably suffering world eating much eating little. Well able time read signs road, he perceived length he must drawing near town. He already passed house two little lawn front, indications garden behind; he hoped yet here, all, he might get work. To door door he carried his modest request: doors shut his face almost he could speak; others he civil word maid, rough word man; none came sound assent. It become harder find shelter. Ever he went, space appropriated enclosed; less less room left man made special cubic provision earth air, money--the disreputable conditions eyes would helpless none. A rare philosopher eyes capable understanding him, he despicable eyes common man. To know human one must human--that is, divine must strong him. For days now, neither Clare Abdiel come even within sight food enough make meal. The dog rather thinner his master. “Abdiel,” said Clare one day, “I fear soon serpent! Your body gets longer longer, legs get shorter shorter: you will crawling presently, rubbing hair useless little belly dusty road! Never mind, Abdiel; you will good serpent. Satan turned bad serpent he bad angel; good serpent, good dog! I hope, however, shall yet put stop serpent-business!” Abdiel wagged his tail, much say, “All right, master!” The nights cold; winter coming fast. Had Clare long enough one place people know him, he would never allowed go cold hungry; he always move on, nobody time learn care him. So terrible sunless season threatened wrap winding-sheet, lay down. One evening, sunset, grown sleepy spite gathering cold, he sat one two steep grassy slopes bordered road. His feet bare now, bare brown, his shoes come plight relief throw away; his soles grown like leather. They rested dry shallow rain-channel, his body leaned back slope. Abdiel, instead jumping bank lying soft grass, lay leathery feet, covered night his long faithful body coat tangled hair. The sun shooting his last radiance along road, redness caressed sleeping companions, elderly lady came her gate top opposite slope, looked along road sun. Her reverting glance fell upon sleepers--the Knight Hope lying rags, marble, his feet upon his dog, his dog upon his feet. It touching picture, old lady's heart one easily touched. She looked saw face boy, whose hunger plain his rags, calm wintry sky. She wondered, she needed wondered; storm anger, drought greed, rotting mist selfishness, passed rested there, billow, score, waste. Her mere glance seemed wake Abdiel, took advantage his waking lick brown, dusty, brave, uncomplaining feet, well used world's _via dolorosa_. She saw, touched yet ministration guardian feet. Gently opening gate she descended slope, crossed road, stood silent, regarding outcasts. No cloudy blanket covered sky: ere morning dew would lie frozen grass! “You should not sleeping there!” she said. Abdiel started his four feet would snarled, one look lady changed his mind. Clare half awoke, half sat up, made inarticulate murmur, fell back again. “Get up, boy,” said old lady. “You must indeed!” “Oh, please, madam, must I?” answered Clare, slowly rising his feet. “I lain down, I am tired!--If I may not sleep _there_,” he continued, “where _am_ I sleep?--Please, madam, everybody set letting boy sleep? It do not cost anything! I understand giving work, he looks much want it; count bad lie sleep?” The lady wisely let talk; he stopped she answer him. “It is frost, boy!” she said. “It would death sleep doors to-night!” “It is nice place it, madam!” “To sleep in? Certainly not!” “I did not mean that, madam. I meant nice place go away from--to die in, madam!” “That choose,” answered old lady severely, tone her severity trembled. “I shall not find anywhere nice bank,” said Clare, turning looking sorrowfully. “There plenty places town. It is mile farther on!” “But much nicer, madam! And I have money--none all, madam. When I came prison,--” “Came _where_?” “Out prison, madam.” He never prison legal sense, never convicted anything; he know difference detention imprisonment. “Prison!” she exclaimed, holding her hands horror. “How dare mention prison!” “Because I it, madam.” “And say coolly too! Are ashamed yourself?” “No, madam.” “It is shame prison.” “Not I did not anything wrong.” “Nobody believe that, I am afraid!” “I suppose not, madam! I used feel angry people would not believe me, I see blame. And I have got used it, do not hurt much.--But,” he added sigh, “the worst is, will not give work!” “Do always tell people you have come prison?” “Yes, madam, I think it.” “Then cannot wonder will not give work!” “I do not, madam--not now. It seems law universe!” “Not universe, I think--but world--perhaps!” said old lady thoughtfully. “But there is one thing I wonder at,” said Clare. “When I say I have prison, believe me; I say I have not done anything wrong, mock me, seem quite amused expected believe that. I cannot get it!” “I daresay! But people always believe yourself.--What going do, then, nobody give work? You cannot starve!” “Indeed I _can_, madam! It is one thing I have got do. We have pretty near last sometimes--me Abdiel! Have not we, Abby?” The dog wagged his tail, old lady turned aside control her feelings. “Do not cry, madam,” said Clare; “I do not mind it--not _much_. I am glad I did not _do_ anything, mind much! Why I! Ought I mind much, madam? Jesus Christ had not done anything, killed _him_! I do not fancy it is bad die hunger! But we will soon see!--Shall not we, Abby?” Again dog wagged his tail. “If did not anything wrong, _did_ do?” said old lady, almost her wits' end. “I do not like telling things going believed. It is like washing face ink!” “I _try_ believe you.” “Then I tell you; speak truth, madam, so, perhaps, able believe truth!” “How know I speak truth?” “Because did not say, 'I believe you.' Nobody sure that. But sure _trying_; said, 'I _try_ believe you.'” “Tell then.” “I will, madam.--The policeman came middle night asleep, took us away, house ours.” “Whose then?” “Nobody knew. It call chancery. There nobody moths flies spiders rats;--though I think rats came eat baby.” “Baby! Then whole family you, father, mother, all, taken prison!” “No, madam; fathers mothers taken dome angels.”--What hunger sleepiness, Clare talking like child.--“I have not father mother world. I two fathers two mothers there, one mother world. She is mother wild beasts.” The old lady began doubt boy's sanity, she went questioning him. “How baby you, then?” “The baby own, madam. I took her water-butt.” Once Clare tell his story--from time, is, his adoptive father mother died. He told simple matter-of-fact way, yet quaint remarks, simplicity difficult understand, that, old lady, her trying, able quite believe his tale, she doubted whether boy one God's innocents, angel-haunted brain. “And what is become Tommy?” she asked. “He is workhouse baby. I am glad; I done Tommy, nothing give eat, I cannot think. He would sure steal! I could not kept it!” “You must careful company.” “Please, madam, I careful Tommy. He best company I could give him: I try better Tommy's sake. But trying was not much use Tommy, long he would not try! He little better, though, I think; I now, could give plenty eat, baby well Abdiel help me, might make something Tommy, I think.--_You_ think so--do not you, Abdiel?” The dog, stood looking his master's face time he spoke, wagged his tail faster. “What name give dog! Where find it?” “In Paradise Lost, madam. Abdiel one angel, remember, madam, who, he saw Satan to, left him, went back his duty.” “And his duty?” “Why course God told him. I love Abdiel, I love little dog he took care baby, I call Abdiel too. Heaven far makes confusion name.” “But dare give name angel dog?” “To _good_ dog, madam! A good dog good enough go angel--at his heels course! If he bad dog, would wicked name good angel. If dog Tommy--I mean Tommy dog, I call Moloch, Belzebub! God made angels dogs; dogs good, God loves them.--Do not he, Abdiel?” Abdiel assented his usual fashion. The lady said nothing. Clare went on. “Abdiel will not mind--the angel Abdiel, I mean, madam--he will not mind lending his name friend. The dog name his own, perhaps, day--like rest us!” “What _your_ name?” “The name I is, like dog's, borrowed one. I shall get one day--not here--but there--when--when--I am hungry enough go find it.” Clare grown white. He sat down, lay back grass. He talked minutes weeks, want made weak. He felt faint. The dog jumped up, fell licking his face. “What wicked old woman I am!” said lady herself, ran across road like little long-legged bird, climbed bank swiftly. She disappeared within gate, return presently tumbler milk huge piece bread. “Here, boy!” she cried; “here medicine you! Make haste take it.” Clare sat feebly, stared tumbler moment. Either he could hardly believe his eyes, sick take once. When he his hand, he held dog. “Here, Abdiel, little,” he said. This offended old lady. “You are never going give dog good milk!” she cried. “A little it, please, madam!” “--And feed tumbler too?” “He is nothing to-day, madam, we are comrades!” “But it is clean you!” “Ah, do not know dogs, madam! His tongue clean clean anybody's.” Abdiel took three four little laps milk, drew away, looked his master--as much say, “You, now!” “Besides,” Clare went on, “he could not get well bottom tumbler.” With he raised his lips, drank eagerly, set road half empty, looking his thanks giver smile she thought heavenly. Then he broke bread, giving dog nearly half it, began eat rest himself. The old lady stood looking silence, pondering she celestial beggar. “Would mind sleeping greenhouse, I bed put you?” she said length, tone apologetic. “This better place--though I wish warmer!” said Clare, another smile he looked sky, stars beginning twinkle, thought gardeners he met. “--Do not think better, madam?” “No, indeed, I do not!” she answered crossly; her open air night seemed wrong, disreputable. There something unholy it! “I would rather stay here,” said Clare. “Why?” “Because do not quite believe me, madam. You cannot; cannot help it. You would not able sleep thinking boy prison lying greenhouse. There would saying he might do! I read newspaper old lady took lad her house servant, he murdered her!--No, madam, thank you! After supper shall sleep beautifully!--Shall not we, Abby? And then, perhaps, could give job garden to-morrow! I daresay gardener wants little help sometimes! But he knew slept greenhouse, he would hate me.” The old lady said nothing, for, like old ladies, she feared her gardener. She took tumbler boy's hand, went house. But two minutes she came again, another great piece bread Clare, bone something she threw Abdiel. The dog's ears started up, erect alive, like individual creatures, his eyes gleamed; he looked his master, would touch bone without his leave--which given, he fell upon it, worried rat. Clare again, old lady left third time, he walked her across way, bread hand, open gate her. When she inside, he took his cap, bade her good-night grace left her heart. Before she taken three steps gate, old lady turned. “Boy!” she called; Clare, making his couch stars, hastened back sound her voice. “I shall able sleep,” she said, “for thinking bleak night!” “I used it, madam!” “Oh, I daresay! see I am not! I do not like thought it! You may like hoarfrost-sheets, I know, I do not! You may like stars tester--because want die go them, I suppose!--but I fancy stars! You foolish fellow, I temper you. You do not give thought me--or feelings die! I never go bed good conscience!--Besides, I nurse you!” The last member her expostulation hardly logical sequence, less influence Clare that. “I whatever please, madam,” he answered humbly. “--Come, Abdiel!” The dog came running across road his bone his mouth. “You must not bring inside gate, Ab!” said Clare. The dog dropped it. “Good dog! It is lady's garden, know, Abdiel!” Then turning his hostess, Clare added, “I always tell I am pleased him: do not think right, madam?” “I daresay! I do not know anything dogs.” “If dog like Abdiel, he would soon teach dogs, madam!” rejoined Clare. By time house-door. The lady told wait there, went in, talk her two maids. In half hour, Clare his four-footed angel asleep--in outhouse, true, comfortable bed, seen since flight caravans. The cold breeze wandered moaning like lost thing round bare walls, every time woke, went abroad see hope world; touch them; ears got dreams, made sleep sweeter, sense refuge deeper. But although bewitching boy his good dog lying open air her gate, although never thought murder theft came trouble her, long old lady found repose. Her heart deeply touched. Chapter LIII. The gardener. From fact his hostess made answer he breathed hope job her garden, Clare concluded he presumed suggesting thing her, she would relieved departure. When he woke morning, therefore, early grand sleep, he felt he right linger: he invited sleep, he slept! He also shrank idea supposed expect his breakfast he went. So, soon he got up, he walked gate, crossed road, sat spot he occupied night before, wait house astir. For, although he could linger within gates he unknown, neither could he slink away without morning-thanks gift warm night. As he sat, he grew drowsy, leaning back, fell fast asleep. The thoughts his hostess running different lines, she woke feelings concerning pauper different pauper imagined her. She must something him; she must give get work! As giving work, her difficulty lay gardener. She resolved, however, attempt over-coming it. She rose earlier usual, therefore, man, sleep house, yet come, she went gate meet thing over--so eager she, nervous prospect interview her dreaded servant. “Good gracious!” she murmured aloud, “does rain beggars?” For there, spot, lay another beggar, another boy, dog his bosom facsimile ugly white thing named Milton's angel! She feel moved go make his acquaintance. It could another family, could it? already heard his brother's good luck, come see whether might picking too! She turned away hurriedly lest he wake, went back house. But looking behind her she mounted steps, she caught sight gardener gate, casting displeased look across road he entered: he like see tramps about! Her heart sank little, she turned aside. The gardener came in, his mistress joined walked his work, telling much she thought fit concerning boy, interspersing her narrative hints duty giving every one chance. She took care mention he come prison somewhere. “No one driven despair,” she said, little thinking she used almost words Lord, according Sinaitic reading passage St. Luke's gospel. The argument little force rough Scotchman: his mistress soft-hearted! He shook his head ominously idea giving tramp chance decent work, last consented, show over-persuaded imprudent action, let boy help day, see he got on, stipulating, however, he supposed pledged anything. Miss Tempest's plans went beyond gardener's scope. She months inclined boy help house--an inclination justified late unexpected accession income: boy he seemed, he would make valuable servant; nothing could clear her judgment better, she thought, putting test brief subjection cross-grained, exacting Scotchman. By she would soon know whether dismiss him, venture farther! She wrung his hard consent gardener, cook came running, say boy gone. Upon poor Miss Tempest's heart fell cold avalanche. “But we have counted spoons, madam, they are right!” said cook. This additional statement, however, seem give much consolation benevolent old lady. She stood moment her eyes ground, pained move speak. Then she started, ran gate. The cook ran after, thinking her mistress gone her mind--and sure she saw her open gate, run straight bank road. But she reached gate herself, she saw her standing boy asleep grass opposite bank. Abdiel, lying his bosom, watched her keen friendly eyes. Clare dreaming agreeable morning-dream; smile pleasure could haunt innocent face, nickered like sunny ripple still water pool. “No!” said Miss Tempest herself; “there is duplicity there! Otherwise, tree known fruit!” Clare opened his eyes, started lightly his feet, strong refreshed. “Good morning, madam!” he said, pulling his cap. “Good morning--what I call you?” she returned. “Clare, please, madam.” “What Christian name?” “That Christian name, madam--Clare.” “Then surname?” “I called Porson, madam, I another name. Mr. Porson adopted me.” “What name?” “I do not know, madam. I going know one day, I think; day come yet.” He told her he could his adoptive parents, little Maly; time he went farm growing strangely dreamlike, sunk long way dark waters past--all hour Maly carried away long black aunt. The story accounted Miss Tempest his good speech name his dog. The adopted child clergyman might well acquainted _Paradise Lost_, though she herself never read apostrophe Light beginning third book! That she learned school without understanding phrase sentence it; Clare never left passage alone he understood it, or, failing that, invented meaning it. “Well, then, Clare, I have talking gardener you,” said Miss Tempest. “He give job.” “God bless you, madam! I am ready!” cried Clare, stretching his arms, get proper length work. “Where shall I find him?” “You must breakfast first.” She led way kitchen. The cook, middle-aged woman, looked dog, her face puckered points interrogation exclamation. “Please, cook, give young man breakfast? He wanted go work without any, would not do--would it, cook?” said her mistress. “I hope dog will not running kitchen day, madam!” “No fear that, cook!” said Clare; “he never leaves me.” “Then I do not think--I am afraid,” she began, stopped. “--But that is none business,” she added. “John look his own--and more!” Miss Tempest said nothing, she almost trembled; John, she knew, perfect hatred dogs. Nor could anyone wonder, for, gate open gate shut, came ran his beds. She dared interfere! He Clare must settle question Abdiel Abdiel them! She left kitchen. The cook threw dog crust bread, Abdiel, look his master, fell upon his white, hungry little teeth. Then she proceeded make cup coffee Clare, casting occasional glance pity his garments, miserably worn rent, his brown bare feet. “How face blessed world, boy, expect work garden without shoes?” she said length. “Most things I well enough without them,” answered Clare; “--even digging, ground hard. My feet used soft, soles like leather.--They have grown shoes,” he added, smile, looked straight her eyes. The smile look went far win her heart, her mistress: she felt true, wondered fair-spoken, sweet-faced boy could tramp. She poured huge cup coffee, fried piece bacon, cut much bread butter he could dispose of. He often eaten anything dry bread, general dry, since he left menagerie, felt feasted like emperor. Pleased master, cook fed dog equal liberality; then, curious witness reception John, herself continuous feud, she conducted Clare gardener. From distance he saw coming. With look irate fixed upon dog, he started meet them. Clare knew well meaning look, saw Satan regarding Abdiel eye fire, words his lips-- “And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.” The moment he came near enough, without word, show malice beyond lay his eye, he made, sharp hoe he carried, sudden downstroke faithful angel, thinking serve Gabriel served Moloch. But Abdiel quick him: he read danger his gait moment he saw move, enmity his eyes he came nearer. He kept therefore his eyes hoe, never moved moment attack. Then he darted aside. The weapon therefore came hard gravel, jarring arm his treacherous enemy. With muttered curse John followed made another attempt, Abdiel like manner eluded. John followed followed; Abdiel fled fled--never farther yards, seeming almost entice man's pursuit, sometimes pirouetting his hind legs escape blows gardener, growing furious failure, went aiming him. Fruitlessly Clare assure neither would dog harm, allow one hit him. It weariness last he desisted, wiping his forehead his shirt-sleeve, turned upon Clare smothered wrath knows ridiculous. For time cook stood by, shaking delighted laughter his every fresh discomfiture. “Awa', ye deil's buckie,” he cried, “an tak' little Sawtan wi' ye! Dinna lat see yer face again.” “But lady told would give job!” said Clare. “I didna tell her I wad gie yer tyke job! I wad though, gien he wad lat me!” “He is given stiff one!” said cook, laughed again. The gardener took notice her remark. “Awa' wi' ye!” he cried again, yet wrathfully, “--or--” He raised his hand. Clare looked his eyes budge. “For shame, John!” expostulated cook. “Would strike child?” “I am child, cook!” said Clare. “He cannot hurt much. I have good breakfast!” “Lat 'i am tak' awa' deevil tyke his, I tauld him,” thundered gardener, “or I will mak' pulp 'i am!” “I have breakfast, sir, I am bound give whole day's work return for,” said Clare, looking angry man; “and I will not stir till I have done it. Stolen food stomach would turn sick!” “Gien did, wadna first time, I reckon!” said gardener. “It _would_ first time!” returned Clara “You rude.--If Abdiel understood Scotch, he would bite you,” he added, dog, hearing his master speak angrily, came up, ears erect, took his place his side, ready combat. “Ye'll hae tak' ither mode payin' debt!” said John. “Stick spaud yird here, ye sall not! You I maun flit first!” With he walked slowly away, shouldering his hoe. “Come, Abdiel,” said Clare; “we must go tell Miss Tempest! Perhaps she will find something else us do. If she cannot, she will forgive us breakfast, we will tramp again. I thought going day's rest--I mean work; that is rest want! But man enemy poor.” The gardener half turned, he would speak, changed his mind went his way. “Never mind John!” said cook, loud enough John hear. “He is old curmudgeon cannot sleep nights quarrellin' inside him. I will go mis'ess, go sit kitchen till I come you.” Chapter LIV. The Kitchen. Clare went kitchen, sat down. The housemaid came in, stood moment looking him. Then she asked he wanted there. “Cook told wait here,” he answered. “Wait what?” “Till she came me. She is gone speak Miss Tempest.” “I will not dog here.” “When I home,” remarked Clare, “our servant said cook queen kitchen: I do not want rude, madam, I must she told me.” “She never told bring mangy animal here!” “She knew he would follow me, she said nothing him. But he is mangy. He has not enough eat mangy. He is lean dried fish!” The housemaid, fat, inclined think remark personal; Clare looked her clear, honest, simple eyes, she forgot notion, thought wonderfully nice boy he looked. “He is shamefully poor, though! His clothes are not even decent!” she remarked herself. And certainly white skin look several places. “You will not let put his nose anything, you?” she said quite gently, returning his smile pleasant one her own. “Abdiel much gentleman it,” he answered. “A dog gentleman!” rejoined housemaid merry laugh, willing draw out. “Abdiel hungry greedy,” answered Clare, young woman silent. Miss Tempest Mrs. Mereweather time turning question done strange boy. They agreed bad anyone willing work prevented earning even day's victuals bad temper gardener. But his mistress want send man away. She found scrupulously honest, many bad-tempered man, she like changes. The cook her part taken fancy Clare she want set garden-work; she would house, begin training page. Now Miss Tempest greatly desiring thing, dread cook would say, delighted, therefore, first suggestion came Mrs. Mereweather herself. The obstacle cook's eyes long, spectral dog. The boy could fool, however,--she said, lover animals--as let wretched beast like come betwixt good situation! “It is right, Clare,” said Mrs. Mereweather, entering her queendom radiant within she could repress outshine her pleasure. “Mis'ess an' me, we have arranged all. You are help kitchen; an' you are told, an' willin' learn, we will soon get troubles. There is one thing way.” “What it, please?” asked Clare. “The dog, course! You must part dog.” “That I cannot do,” returned Clare quietly, countenance fallen sorrowful. “--Come, Abdiel!” The dog started up, every hair full electric vitality. “You do not mean you are going walk beastly ungrateful fashion--an' miserable cur!” exclaimed cook. “The lady kind us, we are grateful her, ready work her she let us;--are not we, Abdiel? But Abdiel done far Miss Tempest! To part Abdiel, leave starve, get bad company, would sheer ingratitude. I creature Miss Tempest ought nothing with: I might serve her young butler I told her of! It is bad ungrateful dog person. Besides, he would not leave me. He would always hanging about.” “John would soon knock head.” “Would he, Abdiel?” said Clare. The dog looked his master's face comical answer his own, cook burst laughing, began like Abdiel. “But do not really mean say,” she persisted, “that you would go tramp, cold hungry to-morrow yesterday--and sake dog? A dog are not Christian!” “Abdiel's Christian I know,” answered Clare: “he his master tells him.” “There is something that!” said cook. “If I parted Abdiel, I could never hold head among angels,” insisted Clare. “Think harm might him! He could trust nobody after, his goodness might give way! He might grow worse Tommy!--No; I have got take care Abdiel, Abdiel's got take care me!--'Are not you, Abby?” “We cannot kitchen nohow!” said cook relenting tone. “Poor fellow!” said housemaid kindly. The dog turned her wagged his tail “What would not I give lover like that!” said housemaid--but whether Clare dog I cannot say. “I know I shall do!” cried Clare, sudden resolve. “I ask Miss Tempest up-stairs her, she tired either us, go away together.” “A probable thing!” returned cook. “A lady like Miss Tempest dog like her! She would eaten alive fleas! In ten minutes she would!” “No fear that!” rejoined Clare. “Abdiel catches his _own_ fleas!--Do not you, Abby?” The dog instantly began burrow his fell hair--an answer might taken either two ways: might indicate comprehension corroboration his master, necessity fresh hunt. The women laughed, much amused. “Look here!” said Clare. “Let tub water--warm, please--he likes that: I tried once, passing factory, lot running waste. Then, help bit soap, I will show body hair astonish you.” “What breed he?” asked housemaid. “He is true breeds sun, I fancy,” returned his master; “but seems sky-blue terrier sort.” The talked Clare, better women liked him. They got tub plenty warm water. Abdiel nothing loath plunged in, Clare washed thoroughly. Taken dried, he seemed lady's chamber unmeet. “Now,” said Clare, “will please ask Miss Tempest I may bring lawn, show her his tricks?” The good lady much pleased cleverness instant obedience little animal. Clare proposed she keep her. “But he stay me? he _I_ tell him?” she asked. Clare took dog aside, talked him. He told he going do, he expected him. How much Abdiel understood, tell! his master laid Miss Tempest's feet, he lay; Clare went cook, he move, though he cast many wistful glance lord his heart. When his new mistress went house, he followed her submissively, his head hanging, his tail motionless. He soon recovered his cheerfulness, however, seemed know his friend abandoned him. Chapter LV. The wheel rests time. That part human race fond dolls, may imagine pleasure cook going town omnibus buy everything live doll big Clare! In days she dressed her heart's content, satisfaction her mistress, would livery, plain suit dark blue cloth: she loved blue, her men-people being, navy. Thus dressed, he looked much gentleman before: his look refinement owed nothing contrast his rags. Better clothes make seem commoner. When Mrs. Mereweather came back town first day, she found ragged boy got her kitchen scullery nice clean, everything ready her hand, she got her work done she went, omnibus would permit. This rejoiced her much; woman experience, she continued little anxious lest his sweet ways go his rags, lest his new garments breed bumptiousness bad manners. For change unfrequent result prosperity. But Mr. Porson's teaching example, Mrs. Person's management, responsiveness boy's disposition, thought never came whether thing fit do: thing right thing, done, he well another! To earn his Abdiel's bread, he would anything honest, setting his back nothing. But thing, he forgot even his obligation it, glad endeavour well. As days went on, Mrs. Mereweather disappointed him. He everything she housemaid always ready spare help him. Very soon began grow tender him; pretence his earlier drest open door, certain things he quite content do, like seeing do. Many--I afraid boys would presumed generosity, Clare nowise injured it. Nothing could kinder way his mistress treated him. Having lent books, perceived he careful them, she let run her library his day's work over. For he read respected books. Nothing shows vulgarity way people treat books. No gentleman would write his remarks margins another person's book; lady would brush her hair she read one her own. From hungry days cold nights, Clare Abdiel found _in clover_--the phrase surely lover cows!--and content. Clare longed much work, many weary day sought vain, he valued work. And he seemed know instinctively man ranks, according thing he does, according way he it. In life far higher inferior thing well superior thing passably. Clare made good use his privileges, read much, educating none worse he unconsciously. He read whatever came his way. He read really--not people read, leaving sentences behind like many unbroken nuts, kernel whose meaning seen. He learned boys school, even young men college; one knows, one uses, true measure learning. Whatever he read, he read point practice. In history romance he saw--not merely man ought do, he must, moment, do. There common sort man calling practical, neglecting practise important things, would laugh idea Clare practical, seeing he trouble his head money, “getting world”--what servants call “bettering themselves;” practical man find he practical fool. Clare took heed right, grow better man. Such life really practical one. People wondered Miss Tempest managed get hold nice-looking page, good lady flattered wonder. But she knew world well sure yet. She knew difficult, human tree, distinguish blossom fruit. Deeds lovely impulse blossom; unvarying, determined Tightness fruit. Chapter LVI. Strategy. Miss Tempest last old family, scarce relation, near one, world. Hence pieces personal property continued possession various branches family land money, fault misfortune, gone, mostly drifted small pool Miss Tempest's life slowly sinking sands time, gleam sparkle tale old splendour. She think often money-worth: she done so, she would kept her banker's; she valued greatly beauty associations, constantly using many she could. More one her friends repeatedly tried persuade her prudent much plate many jewels house, fact sure known least desirable should: she always said she would think it. At times she would moment contemplate sending her valuables bank; her next thought--by means unwise one--would always be, “Of use bank? I might well all! Better sell good money!--No; I must me!” There predatory persons every large town, either know learning know houses worth risk robbing. When falls lot house attempted, one gang make acquaintance servant it, object discovering beforehand treasure lies, reducing time spent it, risk frustration capture. Often seduce one household let in, hand things want. Any gang, however, must soon become convinced Miss Tempest's corruption impossible, could avail solely internal resources. It well Miss Tempest she faithful herself encourage faithfulness others: gladly would she Abdiel sleep her room, she would take pleasure his company his old master companion suffering. The dog therefore slept Clare's bed, he bed hard define lie upon, he take part neither blanket hot bottle. One night, half-past twelve, watchful even slumber, he sprang his lair his master's feet, listened moment, gave low growl, listened, gave another growl. Clare woke, found his bed trembling tremor his little four-footed guardian. Telling keep quiet, he rose his elbow, his turn listened, could hear nothing. He thought he would light his candle go down, concluded wiser descend without light, listen cloak darkness. If he could save Miss Tempest fright! He crept bed, went first window--a small one narrowing gable-wall his attic room: night warm, and, loving night air, he open. Hearkening moment, he thought he heard slight movement below. Very softly he put his head, looked down. There moon, momentary flash lantern he caught sight small pair legs disappearing inside scullery window, almost his own. Swift noiseless he hurried down, reached scullery door time little fellow came stealing it, run him. Now Clare heard housemaid read enough newspapers guess, moment he looked garret window, legs he saw boy sent open door window, boy, feeling his way dark, came him, he gripped throat squeeze used silence Tommy. The prowler knew squeeze. The moment Clare relaxed it, piping whisper came words, “Clare! Clare! said they would kill I did not!” “Did not what?” “Open door them.” “If utter one whimper, I will throttle you,” said Clare. He tightened his grasp instant, Tommy, forgotten Clare said, he did, immediately gave in, led away. Clare took his arms carried his room, tied hand foot, left floor, fast bedstead. Then he crept swiftly servants' room, difficulty waking them, told he done, asked help him. Both women sense courage, undertook part. But he proposed open window, done Tommy, enticing burglars enter, secure first them, they, naturally enough, wisely too, declined encounter risk. The burglars, perplexed lack sign Tommy yet utter quiet house, concluded probably he fallen somewhere, lying either insensible, unable move afraid cry out--in case would mercy he might say he found. Those within could hear little noise without. They went door window, wherever attempt might made, still. Then occurred Clare he left scullery window unwatched. He hastened it--and time: two long thin legs sticking through, showed movements considerable effort made body belonged them, enter them. Legs first wrong way, youth feared unknown fate Tommy, pig-headed, would go way all. A boy courage equal Clare, less coolness, would made war intrusive legs; Clare bethought that, long body filled window, body could pass way; would well keep there, cork house, making like nest trap-door-spider. He begged women, therefore, followed him, lay hold ankle, stick like clamp, he ran get string. The women, entering heartily business, held bravely. The owner legs made vigorous efforts release them, anxious good deal get he get in, he strong, scope. His accomplices laid hold pulled; then, good mother-wit, women pulled away other, made his legs wedge. Clare came back piece clothes-line, one end he slipped running knot round one ankle, like fashion round other. Then he cut line halves, drawing two hooks ceiling, distance apart, legs continued widespread like V upside down, hauled feet high he could, fastened ends lines. Hold lines hooks, impossible draw fellow out. Leaving women watch, telling keep hand lines scullery pitch-dark, he went next his room looked window. He feared might trying get place, would readily abandon accomplices, doubtless knew small household was! He would see first, therefore, outside scullery, make round doors windows! Right he looked out, stood short, burly figure; another man taking intermittent hauls arms leg-tied companion, regardless his stifled cries pain he so. Clare went fetched his water-jug, half full, leaning more, jug upright his two hands, moved way he it, nearly he could determine, man beneath him, dropped it. The jug fell plumb, might killed man he bent his head moment, received his shoulders. It knocked breath him, he lay motionless. The man fled. The window-stopper, hearing crash jug, wrenched kicked struggled, vain. There he wait sunrise, moment sooner would cook open door. When went last, stout man gone. He risen staggered shrubbery, fallen, risen got away. Their captive pretended dead, thinking move pity set free. But Clare went next house got man-servant go police, begging make haste: he knew his tender-hearted mistress, she came police arrived, would certainly let fellow go, Tommy him; he determined law way he could compass What hope wretched Tommy he allowed escape! And right let people loose neighbours! It selfishness indulge one's pity danger others! He would his brother's keeper holding his brother's enemy! Going last his room, he found Tommy asleep. The boy better dressed, cleaner first he knew him. Clare proceeded wash dress. Tommy woke, lay staring, utter sound. “Have sleep out,” said Clare. “The police will not here, I daresay, hour yet.” “I believe you!” returned Tommy, impudent ever. His contemplation Clare revived his old contempt him. “I mean go. I 'are not done nothing.” “Go, then,” said Clare, took heed him. “If it is manners want, Clare,” resumed Tommy, “_please_ let go!” Clare turned looked him. The evil expression hardened his countenance. He gave answer. “You are not never agoin' turn agin old pal, aire you?” said Tommy. “I are not pal yours, Tommy, thief's!” answered Clare. “I will take oath beak!” “You will soon chance; I have sent police.” Tommy changed his tone. “Please, Clare, let go,” he whined. “I not. I I could before, I will I now. You must go police.” Tommy began blubber, pretend--Clare could tell which. “This beastly string's cuttin' me!” he sobbed. Clare examined it, found easy enough. “I will not undo one knot,” he answered, “until there is policeman room. If make noise, I stuff mouth.” His dread his mistress might hear, spoil all. “It is her house,” he said himself, “but they are captives!” Tommy lay still, police came. When untied drew cork scullery window, Clare thought he seen before, could remember where. One policemen, however, moment his eyes fell his face, cried joyfully, “Ah, ha, beauty! I have lookin' you!” “Never set eyes ye afore,” growled fellow. “Do not ye say ye are not dear friend mine,” insisted policeman, “when I carry yer pictur' bosom!” He drew pocket-book, photograph, he gazed satisfaction, comparing face him. In another moment Clare recognized lad sent Maidstone exchange band-boxes him. “Her majesty queen wants robbery, know!” said policeman. A boy loved romance generosity truth righteousness, would regretted chance he lost fine action, sought yet set rascal free. There men cheat make presents; men saints abroad churls home, Bunyan says; men screw wages clerks leave vast sums poor; men build churches proceeds drunkenness; men promote bubble companies prayers families morning evening; men, word, generous own; nothing ill-gotten man's money thief's pocket: Clare contemptible order falsely generous. Profiting, doubtless, Maidstone's example, fellow had, Clare learned, run away his master, carrying contents till: whether he deserved punishment his master, may left undiscussed. When first Miss Tempest's friends heard attempt break her house, said--what could she expect she took tramps her service! They consider-ably astonished, however, read newspaper terms magistrate spoken admirable courage contrivance Miss Tempest's page, resolution women her household seconded him. If every third house well defended, he said, crime burglary would disappear. After trial, Clare begged granted interview magistrate. He told he knew Tommy, entreated he might sent reformatory, kept bad company he able distinguish right wrong, he thought he hardly could present The magistrate promised done, kind words dismissed him. Things returned old way Miss Tempest's. Her friends never doubted she would last commit her plate her banker's strong room, found mistaken: she convinced that, servants Abdiel, safe was. The leader gang, injured Clare's water-jug, soon captured, gang broken up. Chapter LVII. Ann Shotover. So void self-assertion Clare, prompt call whoever needed him, quiet yet quick, silent his sympathetic ministrations, studious capable, that, two years, Miss Tempest began feel she ought she could “advance his prospects,” even loss herself his services. He never came regard Miss Tempest he women saved him: he never thought her his fourth mother. Truly good kind she was, she certain manner prevented feeling entirely comfortable her. It escape him, however, Abdiel thoroughly his ease her company; he believed therefore dog knew her better, least her, he. The fact Miss Tempest kept her feelings, vague sense show would waste her substance: one shape yet lingering selfishness unselfish person took. Thus she kept distance, he stayed distance, she her part wondering he open her more, neither doubting right them. Nothing, indeed, wrong--only might come little nearer. Perhaps, also, Miss Tempest little conscious his patroness, his earthly saviour. It natural that, defeated robbery, Clare become little known friends mistress he well served; when, therefore, Miss Tempest spoke her banker concerning ability her page, mentioning that, his spare time, he reading hard, well attending evening-school mathematics, he gained much approbation his master, she spoke one already known one accustomed regard character. The banker listened solemn listening she could tell he thinking. No one ever could tell Mr. Shotover thinking: his face half face; mask face. High world's regard, rich, unquestioned integrity, he believed gathered large fortune; he kept his affairs himself. That he liked his way much never yield it, I give admiration himself: often kind--when required mode kindness pleased him, constant church-goer giver money, always saying less he made his mind, he generally trouble getting it. Priding his moral discrimination, he had, then, suited his need, taken lower position young man he thought would serve his purpose, modelled it. He his eye Clare ever since reading magistrate's eulogy his contrivance courage; Miss Tempest spoke, he made his mind him, something boy repelled him. He scarcely troubled ask was, I believe he could discovered, root repulsion lay himself. Moved part, however, representations Miss Tempest, part also, I think, desire discover boy hypocrite, Mr. Shotover consented give trial, whereupon Miss Tempest made haste disclose her _protegé_ grand thing she done him. She disappointed coolness lack interest Clare heard her great news. She could gratified he want leave her, she annoyed he seemed unaware advantage gained so--high social ascent servitude clerkship would considered. But Clare's horizon world. He inclination figures less persons. Miss Tempest, however, insisting she knew best him, therefore his duty do, he listened respectful silence she say. But she counted her powerful argument--that he owed rise world--did even touch him, move slightest response mind nobly devoid ambition. Her argument truth nonsense; man owes nothing, owes God everything, owes his neighbour whatever his conscience goes require his neighbour. Feeling time, however, she huge claim his compliance her wishes, Clare consented leave her kitchen her friend's bank, he course take lowest position, one counted rest clerks, especially one it, _menial_, requiring bank earlier half hour others, last go away night, sleep house--where uncomfortable room attic story appointed him. Mr. Shotover lived bank--with his family, consisting his wife two daughters. Mrs. Shotover suffered terrible disease--that thinking herself ill nothing matter her except her paramount interest herself--the source least half incurable disease among idle people. The elder daughter high-spirited girl twenty, frank, friendly manner, indicating God meant her be, she was, yet chosen be. She really frank, seemed far friendly she was, selfish she knew, far selfish she seemed: she merry, goes great way seeming. Her mother spent regard upon her; her heart full herself room grown-up daughter well, interests her own. The younger child six, mother took much care half tigress her cub. One morning, little eight of the clock, Clare coming his room open windows bank, he saved tumbling something attic stair, dark, point took rather sharp turn. The something child, gave low cry, started run away: light enough either discern easily like. But Clare, childhood strongest attraction he yet knew, bent his face he stood step her, moonlight glow love faith shone clear eyes little girl. The moment she saw his smile, she knew soul light smile, her doll dropped her hands she raised lay her arms gently his neck. “Oh!” she said, “you are come!” He saw now, dusk, pale, ordinary little face, rather large gray eyes, rather characterless, tiny, up-turned nose, rather pretty mouth. “Yes, little one. Were expecting me?” he returned, his arms her. “Yes,” she answered, tone one stating must know. “How I frightened you, then?” “Only first I thought ogre! That I saw you. Then I knew!” “Who told I coming?” “Nobody. Nobody knew coming me. I have known it--oh, time!--ever since I born, I think!” She turned her head little looked doll lay step two below. “You go now, dolly,” she said. “I do not want more.” Here she paused while, listening reply, went on: “I much obliged you, dolly; I you? You will not never speak! It made quite sad many time, know well! But cannot help it! So go away, please, nobody, never would anybody! I best get somebody, would not! Thank same! I take put dull please, nobody mind.”--Here she left Clare, went down, lifted her plaything.--“Dolly, dolly,” she resumed, “he is come! I knew he would! And do not know you are nobody!” Without looking back, word adieu Clare, she went slowly steps, one one, doll her arms, manifesting neither contempt tenderness. Many child would carried discrowned favourite one leg; she carried her hands. Clare waited narrow, closed-in, wooden stair, little wondering, full thought. His wonder, however, puzzlement it. The child's behaviour involved difficulty. The two existences came together, understood virtue essential nature. In years Clare could put thing words; he sought none time. The child lonely. She done her best her doll, failed her. It companionable. The moment she looked Clare's face, she knew he loved her, she waiting _him_! She surprised see him; otherwise so! He come: good bye, dolly! The child imagination--next conscience strongest ally common sense. She knew, like St. Paul, idol nothing. As men women grow imagination common sense, sacred silly dolls cast moles bats. But pretty Fancy limping Logic powerful usurpers commonplace minds. Clare saw nothing her day, neither tried see her; he his work atmosphere roses. The work nearly interesting house-work, Clare honest gentleman, therefore well: interesting account; his work! But know child house, merely child love, child already loved he could her servant indeed, changed stupid bank almost dome angels. His fellow clerks took little notice beyond what, routine day, unavoidable. He page-boy: less better! Were wronged his introduction company? The poorest creature believed he would served burglars better chance his. Chapter LVIII. Child-talk. As Clare came next morning one, child dark narrow stair. She doll. Her hands lay folded her lap. She sat step, image child-patience. As he approached she move. I believe she held solemn revel expectation. He laid his hand whitey-brown hair smoothed flat her head brush dipped water. Not much dressing wasted Ann--common little name! She rose, turned him, laid her arms his neck. No kiss followed: she taught kiss. “Where is dolly?” asked Clare. “Nowhere. Buried,” answered child. “Where bury her? In garden?” “No. The garden would not nowhere!” “Where, then?” “Nowhere. I threw her window.” “Into street?” “Yes. She fell horse's back, he jumped. I sorry.” “It did not hurt him. I hope did not hurt dolly!” The moment he said it, Clare's heart reproached him: he talking true! he talking his real heart child! Almost indignation she answered:-- “_Things_ do not hurt! Dolly thing! She is _no_ thing now!” “Why?” “Because she fell horse, seen more.” “Is she old enough,” thought Clare, “to read Pilgrim's Progress?” “Will tell me, please,” he said, “_when_ thing thing?” “When will not mind say it.” “And thing thing more?” “When never think again.” “Is fly thing?” “I _could_ make fly mind, would hurt it!” “Of course would not that!” “No; do not want make fly mind. It is one creatures.” Clare thought far enough metaphysics one morning. “I waited yesterday,” he said, “but did not come!” “Dolly did not like buried. I mean, I did not like burying dolly. I cried would not come.” “Then bury dolly?” “She _had_ buried. I told she could not _be_ anybody! So I _made_ her buried.” “I see! I quite understand.--But amuse now?” “I do not want mused now. You's come! I am growed up!” “Yes, course!” answered Clare; he puzzled say next. What could he her? Glad would he take her sea, docks, country somewhere, till dinner-time, dinner take her again! But his work--ugly, stupid work done, dolly _had_ buried! Alas child discarded her toys, suddenly growed up! What she herself? Clare's coming caused loss Ann's former interests: he felt bound make her loss. But how? It serious question, his master, he could moment answer it. “I wish I could stay day!” he said. “But papa wants bank. I must go.” Clare good sight child, loss think must her age. Her language, form utterance, partly precise _grown-up_, partly childish; her wisdom child-like--and opposite precise childish. It wisdom comes unity thought action. “Is anything I I go--for I must go?” said Clare. “Who says _must_ you? Nurse says _must_ me.” “Your papa says _must_ me.” “If did not say _yes_ papa said _must_, would come next?” “He would say, 'Go house, never come again.'” “And would it?” “I must: house his, mine.” “If I did not say _yes_ papa said _must_, would happen?” “He would try make say it.” “And I would not, would he say, 'Go house never come again'?” “No; his little girl!” “Then I think he should not say you.--What name?” “Clare.” “Then, Clare, papa sends his house, I go you.--You would not turn out, would you, I _little_ naughty?” “No; neither would papa.” “If he turned out, would same. Where go, I go. I must, know! Would mind he said 'Go away'?” “I sorry leave you.” “Yes, that is going be! Why stay papa? Were house always--ever long I saw you?” “No; little only.” “Did come street?” “Yes; I came street. Your papa pays work him.” “And would not?” “Then I money, nothing eat, nowhere sleep night.” “Would make uncomfable?” “It would make die.” “Have papa?” “Yes, he is far away.” “You could go him, could not you?” “One day I shall.” “Why do not go now, take me?” “Because he died.” “What is _died_?” “Went away sight, cannot go look till go sight too.” “When be?” “I do not know.” “Does anybody know?” “Nobody.” “Then perhaps never go?” “We must go; it is nobody knows when.” “I think nobody knows, may not never come.--Is work?” “Everybody work one way another.” “I have not work!” “If do not work you are old enough, you will miserable.” “_You're_ old enough.” “Oh, yes, indeed I am! I have working long time now.” “Where? Not papa?” “No; papa.” “Why not? Why did not come sooner? Why did not come _much_ sooner--_ever_ much sooner? Why make wait time?” “Nobody ever told waiting.” “Nobody ever told coming, I knew.” “You wait me, knew. I wait you, I did not know! When time, I tell myself, I have waiting too.” “Waiting me?” “No.” “Who for?” “For father mother--and somebody else, I think.” “That is me.” “No; I am waiting yet. I did not know I coming till I came, were!” The child silent moment. Then she said thoughtfully, “You tell _all_ yourself! That _will_ nice!--Can tell stories?” she added. “--Of course can! You _every_thing!” “Oh, no, I cannot!” “Cannot you?” “No; I _some_ things--not many. I love you, little one!--Now I must go, I shall late, nobody ever ought late.” “Go then. I go nursery wait again.” She went stair without looking behind her. Clare followed. On next floor she went one way her nursery, he another back-stairs. One causes signs Clare's manliness was, he never aimed man. Many men continue childish always trying act like men, instead simply trying right. Such never develop true manliness, Clare's manhood stole upon unawares. That made man kept child, was, he regard anything real, is, true. All day thought kept coming, could he little girl Perhaps stirred his feeling her most, suspicion she neglected. But careless treatment nurse better her would capricious blandishments neglects mother like Mrs. Shotover. Clare, however, knew nothing yet Ann's mother. He knew only, solemnly still ways child, she must much left her resources, wonderfully developed consequence--whether healthily not, he could yet tell. The practical question was--how contrive her occasional companion; offer serve her. After much thinking, he concluded he must wait: opportunity might suggest mode; he would rather find make opportunity! Chapter LIX. Lovers' walks. He long wait. That afternoon, going message head-clerk, he met Ann walking young lady--who must Miss Shotover. Neither sister seemed happy other. Ann white, tired she could drag her little feet her. Miss Shotover, flushed exertion, annoyed her part nursemaid, held her tight hauled her along hand. She looked good-natured, one ministering sort. Every she would give little arm pull, say, though _very_ crossly, “Do come along!” The child cry, plain she suffered. It plain also she her best get home, avoid rousing her sister's tug. Keen-sighted, Clare recognized Ann distance, he approached better opportunity dark stair seeing his little friend like. He saw her eyes unusually clear, and, paces away, could distinguish blue veins her forehead: she looked even delicate he thought her. The lines her mouth straightened painful effort she make keep her sister. Her nose continued insignificant, waiting learn expected it. For Miss Shotover, good feature her face, even casual glance might suggested measure meanness. But bright complexion, youthful charm vanishes youth, pleasant season. Her figure lithe, general she look fun; moment heat impatience clouded her countenance. Clare stopped lifted his hat. Then first dazed child saw him, she short-sighted, her observation dulled weariness. She said word, uttered sound, drew her hand her sister's, held her arms her friend--in dumb prayer lifted thorns life, borne along without pain. He caught her up. “I beg pardon, madam,” he said, “but little one I met before:--I live house, honour youngest father's clerks. If allow me, I carry child. She looks tired!” Miss Shotover glad enough relieved her clog, gave smiling consent. “If would kind carry her home,” she said, “I able little shopping!” “You mind taking her little farther first, madam? I message Mr. Woolrige. I carry her way, careful her.” Miss Shotover one cherish anxiety. She already knew Clare report sight, willingly yielded. Saying, one her pleasant smiles, she would hold accountable her, she sailed away, like sloop dragging her anchor, cut her cable. Clare thought sweet-looking girl she was--and truth she sweet-_looking_. Then, his heart turned little one his arms. What walk them! Little Ann seemed never lived before: she actually happy! She long waiting Clare, he come--and she expected him! It bliss glide thus along busy street without least exertion, looking heads people, safe danger fear amid swift-moving things crowding confusions life! To Clare's arms better little house elephant's back her best picture-book! True, little one! To arms love, ever weak, better ride grandest horse stables God--and God would know it! Never mind pale little face puny nose! While heart ready die love-sake, blessed among women! Only remember die disappointment die either love! And Clare, days upon days dog would come his arms, glory life human child them, little heart pale face beating his side! He going forget Abdiel. Abdiel fact forgotten. Abdiel doll, Abdiel thing would come alive. Abdiel true heart, live soul, Clare would love ever!--not atom less he one upon larger love able flow! All true love makes abler love. It false love, love take meanest selfishness, pleasure loved, love, shrinks narrows soul. To pale-faced, listening child, Clare talked much wonderful Abdiel, kind good Miss Tempest keeping live length his old master; Ann loved dog she never seen, dog loved Clare come last. When returned, Clare rang house-bell, gave his charge man opened door. Without word tone, gesture look objection, even disinclination, child submitted taken Clare's loving embrace, carried nurse neither glad sorry see her. He long gone Mr. Woolrige found fault it. Clare told he met Miss Shotover her sister, child seemed tired he asked leave carry her him, Mr. Woolrige pleased, he said nothing; spot clerks nicknamed _Nursie_; Clare his best justify appellation-he never lost chance acting it, always answered summoned it. Before week ended, he sought interview Miss Shotover, asked her whether he might take little Ann walk whenever evening fine. For five of the clock doors bank shut, half hour he free. Miss Shotover said she saw objection, would tell nurse her ready often weather fit; whereupon Clare left her gratitude far beyond degree emotion her conceivable. The nurse, her part, willing gratify Clare, sorry rid child, one, indeed, interest ordinary woman. The summer came peculiarly fine, almost every evening Clare might seen taking his pleasure--neither like bank-clerk like nurse-maid, always he little Ann his arms, leading her along care entire attention: he never let her walk except entreaty, always then. To his fellow clerks proof utter lack dignity seemed consistent his origin--of knew nothing; knew his late position. To fine gentlemen cigars mouths, he lackey bone! To Clare lover child; he think. Theirs life town; Clare's life universe. The pair came speedily understand communicate like twin brother sister. Clare, he carried her, always knew Ann wanted change position; Ann always knew Clare began grow weary--knew Clare himself--and would insist walking. Neither could remember came, grew custom that, walked hand hand, Clare told her stories his life adventures; he carried her, he told her fairy-tales, he could spin like spider: she preferred former. So neither bank nursery longer dreary. At length came gray, brooding winter, causing red fingers aches chilblains. But unfriendly little Ann. True, she permitted go evening more, Clare, help cook, devoted her his dinner-hour instead. It hardship eat basket place table, one never troubled kind, quality, quantity his food itself. He learned, like good soldier, endure hardness. I heard say never he enjoy dinner when, homeless days his boyhood, he tore flakes loaf fresh baker's oven, ate he walked along street. The old highlanders Scotland trained think part gentleman mind he ate--sign scant civilization, doubt, eyes occupy fill place--as time show, call men fight, eat. Chapter LX. The shoe-black. The head-clerk, he word him, he confessed Mr. Shotover, yet thought Clare would never make man business. When pressed say he grounded opinion, he could answer lad seem his heart it. But if, man business, enough one's duty scrupulously, heart must it, something wrong business. The heart fares treasure: would content his heart fare sorts treasure must? Mr. Woolrige passed judgment, however, upon certain older young men bank, whose hearts certainly business, even worse posited. One cold, miserable day, damp frosty, quite unfit take Ann out, Clare, eaten hasty dinner, followed walk, returning town good time recommencement business, he came upon little boy, corner street, blowing his fingers, stumping pavement keep his blood moving he waited job: his brushes lay top his blacking-box curbstone. Clare saw he hungry cold--states sensation he far familiar look signs indifference. To give something do, something eat, he went his block put his foot it. The boy bustled up, snatched his brushes, began operations. But, whether coldness incapacity his hands, Clare soon saw his boots would polished afternoon. “You do not seem quite business, boy!” he said. “What is matter?” The boy made answer, went his vain attempt. A moment more, Clare saw tear fall boot he work upon. “This will not do!” said Clare. “Let look _your_ boots.” The boy stood up, wiping his eyes back his hand. “Ah!” said Clare, “I do not wonder cannot polish boots, do not care polish own!” “Please, sir,” answered boy, “it is Jim it! He is wi' measles, an' I are not it.” “Look here, then! I will give lesson,” said Clare. “Many's boot I have blacked. Up foot! I will soon show thing's done!” “Please, sir,” objected boy, “there are not enough boot left take polish!” “We will see that!” returned Clare. “Put up. I have worn worse time.” The boy obeyed. The boot bad, enough leather carry blacking, skin took rest. Clare working away, growing pleasantly hot quick, sharp motion, two his fellow clerks strolling side corner, lunch good them. Swinging round, came upon well dressed youth brushing ragged boy's boots. It odd sight, one them, whose name Marway, thought get fun phenomenon. “Here!” he cried, “I want boots brushed.” Clare rose his feet, saying, “Brush gentleman's boots. I finish after, shall finish mine.” “Hullo, Nursie! it is turned boot-black, it?--Nice thing office, Jack!” remarked Marway, finest gentleman, lowest blackguard among clerks. He put his foot block. The boy began his task, better his boots he done Clare's. “Soul ass!” cried Marway, “are going keep foot till freezes block? Why do not Nursie tells you? _He_ knows brush boot! _You_ are not worth salt! You are not fit black donkey's hoofs!” “Give brushes, boy,” said Clare. The boy rose abashed, obeyed. After Clare's light rapid strokes, boots looked different. “Bravo, Nursie!” cried Marway. “There are not flunkey could better!” Clare said nothing, finished job, stood up. Marway, turning heel he set his foot down, said, “Thank you, Nursie!” walking off. “Please, Mr. Marway, give boy his penny,” said Clare. But Marway wanted _take rise of_ Clare. “The fool nothing me!” he answered. “He made boot worse was.” “It I nothing you, Mr. Marway,” rejoined Clare. “What I did, I boy.” “Then let boy pay you!” said Marway. The shoe-black went sudden rage, caught one his brushes, flung Marway he turned. It struck side head. Marway swore, stalked Clare knocked down, strode away grin. The shoe-black sent his second brush whizzing past his ear, he took notice. Clare got up, little worse, bruised. “See comes things passion!” he said, boy came back brushes he hastened secure. “Here is penny! Put foot.” The boy he told, kept foaming rage bloke refused his penny, knocked his friend. It occur he outrage, his friend suffered him. Clare's head ached good deal, he polished boy's boots. Then he made try his boots, when, warmed his rage, he little better. Clare gave another penny, went bank. Marway there, he show day two. Clare said nothing taken place, neither others. Chapter LXI. A walk consequences. Clare bank year, yet Mr. Shotover discovered he quite trust him. Had Clare known he not, he would wondered he trusted precious thing his little Ann. But his child precious Mr. Shotover? When man's heart his business, is, he set making money, precious things precious might be--among rest, living God man's life. He would pass Clare child without even nod indicate approval, smile small woman. He had, I presume, sufficient regard inoffensive little thing content she happy, therefore interfere his clerks counted little honour bank. But although, I said, he still doubted Clare, true eyes whatever head must perceived child charge angel. The countenance Clare Ann his arms, peaceful, radiant simple satisfaction, surely large town who, seeing them, thought angels alway behold face Father heaven. One evening early summer, resumed walks five of the clock, saw, waste place, houses going built last two years, number caravans drawn order. A rush hope filled heart Clare: menagerie he knew well! And, sure enough, Mr. Halliwell superintending operations! But Glum Gunn about, he might find awkward child his arms! Gunn might respect even her! Besides he ought ask leave take her! He would carry her home first, come see his third mother his old friends, Pummy lion rest creatures. Little Ann eager know curious houses wheels were. Clare told her like her Noah's ark, full beasts, real, live beasts, beasts made bits stick. She became eager see them--the eager her contempt things like life would not come alive growing stronger ever since she threw her doll window. Clare told her he could take her without first asking leave. This puzzled her: Clare her highest authority. “But _you_ take me?” she said. “Your papa mamma might like take you.” “But I am yours!” “Yes, you are mine--but much,” he added sigh, “as theirs!” “Are not I?” she rejoined, tone protesting astonishment mingled grief, began wriggle, wanting get down. Clare set her down, would held her, usual, hand, she would let him. She stood her eyes ground, her little gray face looking like stone. It frightened Clare, he remained moment silent, reviewing situation. “You see, little one,” he said length, “you I came! You sent them. You little girl, must mind would like!” “It till came!” she argued. “They do not care _very_ much me. Ask them, please, sell you. I do not think would want much money me! How many shillings think I worth, Clare? Not many, I hope!--Six?” “You worth money papa's bank,” answered Clare, looking her lovingly. The child's face fell. “Am I?” she said. “I am sorry! I did not know I worth much!--and yours!” she added, sigh seemed come heart her being. “Then you are able buy me?” “No, indeed, little one!” answered Clare. “Besides, papas do not sell little girls!” “Oh, yes, do! Gus said Trudie!” Clare knew _Trudie_ meant her sister Gertrude. “Who Gus?” he asked. “Trudie calls Gus. I do not know name him. Perhaps call something else bank.” “Oh! he is bank, he?” returned Clare. “Then I think I know him.” “He said her one night nursery. Jane went down; I crib. They talked long time! I tried go sleep, I could not. I heard he said her. It was not half nice talk me!” This pleasant news Clare. Augustus Marway was, half tales true, fit person his master's daughter intimate with! He heard Mr. Shotover speak gambling terms disapprobation he never heard use anything else; well known bank Marway company gamblers almost every night. He troubled, first he wished child told him. For he do? Could right let thing go on? Clare felt sure Mr. Shotover either know Marway gambled, know he talked nursery his daughter. But, alas, he could nothing without telling, said none lowest cads would carry tales! For young men thought part gentlemen _to stick other_, hide Mr. Shotover things he right know. But Clare saw that, whatever might think, he must act matter. Little Ann wondered he scarcely spoke her way home. But she say anything, she troubled: she belong Clare much she thought she did! Clare reflected also he went, much he owed Ann's sister letting little one. She always spoken kindly too, never seemed, like clerks, look upon he page-boy--though, he thought, often hungry he been, would glad page-boys themselves! For himself, he liked page-boy! He would anything Miss Tempest! And he must he could Miss Shotover! It would wicked let her marry man wicked! He seen drunk! Would fair, knowing she know, tell? Would helping hurt her? Was he coward fear called bad names? Was he, sake good opinion rascals, take care rascal, let lady take care herself? There difficulty, however, he could assert nothing beyond seen drunk! He carried Ann nursery, set menagerie. When he knocked door house-caravan, Mrs. Halliwell opened it, stared hardly instant, threw her arms round his neck, kissed him. “Come in, come in, boy!” she said. “It makes happy woman see again. I have miserable might befallen you, money yours! I have got safe, ready you! I lie awake nights fancy Gunn got hold you, made away you; fall asleep sure it. He is gone several times, looking you, I know! I think he is afraid you; I know he hates you. Mind keep his sight; he will mischief he chance. He is ever, man make life miserable.” “I have never done wrong,” said Clare, “and I am going keep his way I afraid him! I mean come see animals to-morrow.” A great deal passed them. They tea together. Mr. Halliwell, care tea, came went several times, night dark. Then spoke Gunn. “Well, I do not think he will venture interfere you,” said Mrs. Halliwell, “except he happens drunk.--But what is talking? _We_'re quiet night. Listen.” For time Clare conscious whispered sounds dialogue somewhere near, paid attention. The voices plainer first When his mother told listen, he did, thought he heard one before. It peculiar--that old Jew he seen several times bank. As talking went on, he began think he knew voice also. It Augustus Marway. The two fancied caravan full wild beasts. Marway son port-admiral, who, late life, married silly woman. She died young, she ruined her son, whose choice company least respectable officers came ashore king's ships. He late playing deeper worse luck; borrowed one would lend single sovereign more. His father knew, vague way, he going on, nearly lost hope his reformation. Having yet large remains fine physical constitution, he seldom failed appear bank morning--if quite time, yet within margin lateness escaped rebuke. Mr. Shotover connection marriage, gave Marway privilege regarded Miss Shotover cousin--a privilege desirable possibilities contingent, making anxious retain good opinion his employer. Clare heard portion conversation going outside wooden wall; plain nevertheless Marway pressing creditor leave alone he married, he would pay every shilling he owed him. The young fellow persuasive tongue, boasted he could get better even Jew. Clare heard money-lender grant renewal three months, when, Marway pay, accepted suitor lady whose fortune redeem him, his creditor would take his course. The moment he perceived part, Clare hastened caravan, went along edge waste ground, meet Marway his road back town: corner came jump together. Marway started Clare addressed him. Seeing, then, claimed his attention, he drew up. “Well?” he said. “Mr. Marway,” began Clare, “I heard great deal passed old Lewin.” Marway used worse vulgar language times, he now, ending words, “A spy! sneaking spy! Would like lick boot? By Jove, shall know taste it!” “Nobody minds overheard has not something conceal! If I low secrets I would stand side caravan I wanted talk them. I inside. Not hear I stop ears.” “Why did not you, then, low-bred flunkey?” “Because I heard made duty listen.” Marway cursed his insolence, asked he place. He would report him, he said. “What I business,” answered Clare. “Had I known honest man I would listened yours. I right.” “You tell face I am swindler!” said Marway his teeth, letting blow Clare, he cleverly dodged. “I do!” “I do not know mean, bitterly shall repent insolence, prying rascal! This sweet revenge blow courage return!--to dog get hold affairs! You cur! You are going turn informer next, course, bear false witness neighbour! You shall repent it, I swear!” “Will bearing false witness say Miss Shotover know sort man wants marry her? Does she know he wants marry her? Does her father know clutches money-lender?” Marway caught hold Clare threatened kill him. Clare flinch, he calmed little. “What want square it?” he growled. “I do not understand you,” returned Clare. “What is size tongue-plaster?” “I do not know much slang.” “What bribe silence then? I hope plain enough--even _your_ comprehension!” “If I meant hold tongue, I held it.” “What want, then?” “To keep marrying Miss Shotover.” “By Jove! And suppose I kick gutter, tell mind business--what then?” “I tell either father Mr. Shotover it.” “Even cannot fool! What good would you? You are her yourself, you?--Ha! ha!--that is it! I did not nose that!--But come, hang it! where is _use_?--I will give four flimsies--there! Twenty pounds, idiot! There!” “Mr. Marway, nothing make hold tongue--not even promise drop thing.” “Then made come cheek me? Impudence?” “Not all! I glad enough it! I came sake.” “That course!” “I came I would nothing underhand!” “What going next, then?” “I going tell Mr. Shotover, Admiral Marway--I have not yet made mind which.” “What going tell them?” “That old Lewin given three months get engaged Miss Shotover, take consequences able pay owe him.” “And do not count underhand carry tale?” “I not. It would I had not told first. I would tell Miss Shotover, only, she anything girl, she would not believe me.” “I think not! Come, come, reasonable! I always thought good sort fellow, though I _was_ rough you, I confess. There! take money, leave chance.” “No. I save lady I can. She shall least know sort man are.” “Then it is war knife, it?” “I mean tell truth you.” “Then worst. You shall black boots again.” “If I do, I shall penny first.” “You cringing flunkey!” “I have not cringed you, Mr. Marway!” Marway tried kick him, failed, strode dark lamps town. Chapter LXII. The cage puma. Marway fine, handsome fellow, whose manners, he saw reason, soon favour, two young men office his ready slaves. Every moment next day Clare watched. Marway laid his plans, would forestall frustration. Clare could hardly anything dinner-hour, Marway would make assurance double sure. At anchor roads lay certain frigate, whose duty sail round islands, like duck her floating brood. Among young officers board two Marway intimate. He met night before, together laid plot nullifying Clare's interference Marway's scheme--which his friends also reason wish successful, Marway owed money. Clare come way three. Now little Ann guardian cherub object enmity, he she must first separated. Clare asked leave Miss Shotover take child Noah's ark, she called it, evening, Marway learned her: Clare's going would favour plan, child's presence would render impracticable. One thing favour was, Mr. Shotover home. If Clare resolved telling rather admiral, he could next evening, would give abundant time. On hand, watched, could easily prevent finding admiral. But Clare indeed come conclusion his master first right know he tell. His object exposure Marway, protection his master's daughter: he would, therefore, wait Mr. Shotover's return. He said also, Marway would thereby chance bethink himself, and, like Hamlet's uncle, “try repentance can.” As soon he put bank order night, he went find his little companion, take her Noah's ark. The child sitting morning afternoon profound stillness expectation; hour came passed, Clare appear. “You never, never, never came,” she said afterward. “I go bed, beasts went away.” It many long weeks she told this, her solemn little visage smiled again. He went little room hall, he almost always found her waiting him, dressed go. She there. Nobody came. He grew impatient, ran his eagerness front stair. At top he met butler coming drawing-room--a respectable old man, family long his master. “Pardon me, Mr. Porson,” said butler, especially polite Clare, recognizing ennoblement his order, “but rules gentlemen come staircase.” “I know I am wrong,” answered Clare; “but I hurry I ventured once. I have waiting Miss Ann twenty minutes.” “If go down, I make inquiry, let know directly,” replied butler. Clare went down, waited another minute butler brought message child go out. In vain Clare sought explanation; old man knew nothing matter, confessed Miss Shotover seemed little put out. Then Clare saw his desire justice thwarted his endeavour: Marway seen Miss Shotover, he concluded, thoroughly prejudiced her anything he might say, she already taken child him! He repented he told his purpose he ready follow immediate action. Distressed thought little Ann's disappointment, he set show, glad midst his grief, he going see Pummy more. The weather little cloudy day, he left closer part town, vaporous vault gave way, west revealed glorious sunset. Troubled trouble little Ann, Clare seemed drawn sunset. The splendour said him: “Go on; sorrow cloud. Do work given do, clouds keep moving; stop work clouds settle hard.” “When I tramp,” thought Clare, “I always went on, that is I came here. If I had not gone on, I never found darling!” As little day's tramp he know his reflection going justified. He wandered on, minutes passed slowly: wandering child his arms! He haste go menagerie; he would good time beasts; later he was, sooner he would see his mother alone talk her! At last, quite dark, he turned, made caravans. A crowd going steps, passing Mrs. Halliwell slowly, descending area surrounded beasts. Clare went up, laid his money little white table. The good woman took smile, threw her wooden bowl, handed him, his change, three bright sovereigns. Clare turned his face away. He could take them. He felt would break one bond them. “The money's own!” she said, low voice. “By by, mother!” he answered. “No, no, take now,” she insisted, almost angry whisper; moment threw sovereigns among silver, coppers lay table them. Judging her look he better say nothing, he turned went steps. Before he reached bottom them, Glum Gunn elbowed his way past him, throwing scowl his ugly eyes range inches. The place fuller evening, rougher sort company. The show would close hour. It seemed Clare well lighted usual. Perhaps he observe he watched followed Marway, two others, one burly, middle-aged, sailor-looking fellow. But I doubt whether he would seen light, he suspicions, ready analyze crowd distinguish individuals. He avoided making straight Pummy, contenting moment occasional glimpse moving heads, opening vista, closing again, he hoped get gradually nearer unseen, close animal first he descry him, he dreaded attracting attention becoming, yet distance, object uproarious outbreak affection part puma. But he yet good way him, ferocious yell sprang full grown air, fibres his body knew one cries puma enraged. There he his hind legs, ramping front cage, every hair bristling, his tail lashing his flanks. The instant arose commotion crowd behind Clare, pushing stooping swaying fro, shouts of, “Here he is! he is!” Filled foreboding almost prescience, he fell forcing his way without ceremony, got little nearer puma, when, elbowing roughly spectators, red, evil face, drink drunk, Glum Gunn appeared, almost cage--once more, horror Clare, holding neck his poor little Abdiel, curled shape flea. The brute making his way cage puma, whose wrath, grown indescribable frenzy, blazed point-blank dog. I think waft wild odour menagerie must reached nostrils loving creature, brought back old times his master, waked hope finding him. That he arrived plain, he time get his master. Clare almost edge close-packed, staring crowd, absorbed sight huge raving cat. Breaking outermost ring strength sudden terror, he darted cage reach Glum Gunn. A man crossed hustled him. Gunn opened door cage, flung Abdiel puma. Ere he could close it, Clare struck stout left-hander side his head. Gunn staggered back. Clare sprang cage--just Pummy spying uttered jubilant roar recognition. His jumping cage prevented puma getting out, crowd trampling death escape The Christians' Friend; Clare in, cage-door might swung night open unheeded--so long, is, dog appeared. As Abdiel puma forgotten him: dog his sight moment, though behind him, his friend he rubbing recognizant noses. Abdiel showed his wisdom keeping background. The moment he flung cage, he got corner it, stood his hind legs. His master believed that, knowing puma loved human form divine, he thought prejudice his favour showing near he could come it. There he yet stood, his head sunk his chest, watching his eyes terrible moment his enemy catch sight him. The moment came. The puma's delight broken wildest motion. He sprang roof his cage, grappling there, looked retorted neck, saw dog. Poor Abdiel immediately raised his head, hope propitiation forlorn, began little dance his master taught him. What Pummy would done him, I fear, I cannot tell. Clare sprang rescue, weight puma's bulk descended, Abdiel, shoulders Clare dog his bosom. In moment evidenced common love, however often jealousy, powerful mediator generous. The puma forgot his hate, dog forgot his fear, presently, admiration crowd, Clare Pummy Abby rolling floor cage. Pummy best rough game. One moment he would bend seemingly unloosable knot confused animality, next he would clinging top his cage, others could follow him. Perhaps human play with, even better dreams loveliest frolics brothers sisters, mother madly merry they, still, moonlit nights among rocks, neither sound scent horse woke devil bosoms! Glum Gunn, angry speak, stood watching scowl fit Lucifer he rose his first fall heaven. He could nothing! If he touched one, three would upon him! Experience taught puma would defence Clare! He must bide his time!--But he must keep hold his chance! He drew his pocket his master-key, moment Clare two, slid key-hole, locked door cage. He now--and his beast dog too! If he could turned puma mad, made tear shreds, he would delayed instant. But he must think! He must say, like Hamlet, “About, brains!” The man, however, wishes evil, find ready helpers he wishes well: place wanted Gunn's aid, would give theirs. He felt touch his arm, glanced sullenly round, saw face whose beauty lay devil. Marway, eye thumb, requested withdraw moment, he hesitate. As he went he chuckled thought Clare he found door locked. Marway's three accomplices drifted one one wait outside: he rejoined Gunn; and, retiring little way caravans, five held council, results make important part Clare's history. Clare seemed absorbed his game his four-footed, one-tailed friends, he wide awake: he Abdiel deliver, kept, therefore, time, least half eye Glum Gunn. He saw Marway come him, saw retire together: moment leave cage Abdiel! He rose, without difficulty, jumping his playmates upon him, went door. The moment he so, crowd greatly amused see puma turn upon dog snarl, dog, fearful sound altered mood, immediately put man, rise one pair feet, begin dance. The puma turned him, went heel his chosen master, stood. In vain Clare endeavoured open gate. He never known locked, could think done. At length, amid laughter spectators, he desisted, three resumed frolics. At admiration visitors broke out. They seen door made fast, kept pretty quiet, waiting would come: thus earned amusement he sought vain open it. When his withdrawal confessed foiled, merrier began mock ruder jeer. But saw laugh, three return gambols, applauded heartily. Just last portion entertainment, Mr. Halliwell, looking while, retired, knowing cage-door locked. He went his wife said, that, boy his dog again, free brother his, menagerie would wild-beast paradise. He would her go see pranks puma's cage, she tired, she said; he strolled his pipe, left his men close exhibition. Mrs. Halliwell fastened her door went bed, little hurt Clare come her. Gradually folk thinned away; last got half-price remained. To attendants hinted going shut shop, one one shuffled out, readier Clare tired Pummy could get merest tail lark more. He quite fresh himself, he woods, would certainly gone home till morning. But he human creature he would insist he saw Clare weary; he inclination play Abdiel his master game, quite well Abdiel, Pummy might forgot himself. When Abby, free fear, knowing well he free danger, crept his master's bosom, Pummy gave low growl, shoving his nose long body dog, one jerk threw yard upon floor, whence Abdiel returned content his master's feet, abandoning place honour one knew stronger, probably counted better. So fell asleep peace. For although Clare knew Abdiel Gunn's prisoners, he feared surprise two rousable companions. Chapter LXIII. The dome angels. When Clare awoke, he knew he asleep long time. It was, notwithstanding, quite dark, something wrong him. His head ached: never ached before. He put his hands: Pummy's hairy body nowhere near. He called Abdiel: whimper answered; cold nose thrust his hand. He gone sleep, surely his two friends! Could he dreamed it? Why darkness thick? There must surely light clouds time! He felt half awake half dreaming. What curious motion he grew aware of? Was something trying keep asleep, something trying wake him? Had put big cradle? Were heaving rouse him? Or could gentle earthquake rocking fro? Would wake earnest presently, pull push, shake rattle, dome angels came shivering upon him? Where he? Not hard floor Pummy's cage, something much harder--like iron. Was he wagon carried things setting show? Something happened him, his mother taking her! But case he would lying softer! _She_ would given bed full aches! What would think bank? What would little Ann think he came her more? He could caravan; motion much smooth pleasant that! He put his hand his face: wet his cheek? It feel nice; felt like blood! Had he blow head? Was gave headache? He felt his head over, could find hurt. Why he lying like log, wondering wondering, instead getting seeing meant? It must darkness headache kept down! The place close! He _must_ get it! He tried get his feet, he rose, his head struck something, he dropped back. He got his knees groped about. On sides he closed in. But he shut dungeon stone. He seemed great wooden box--small enough box, much large coffin. Could one oubliettes roof doge's palace Venice? He laughed idea, motion continued, gentle earthquake seemed trying rock sleep: doge's palace could hardly afloat grand canal! What could mean? What would little Ann without him? She would cry: she never cried--at least, he never seen her cry! would make easier her! What become Abdiel? Had Glum Gunn got him? Then wet his face Abdiel's blood--she would his defence, perhaps, his enemies taking away! Fears anxieties, he never known before, began crowd upon him--not himself; he made think himself, either first second. Something dreadful might going he could prevent! He never miserable. It high time something--to ask great one somewhere, he know where, could somehow, he know how, hear thoughts words, ought done little Ann, Abdiel, Pummy! He prayed his heart, lay still, fell fast asleep. He came again, act drawing deep breath cool, delicious air. He longer shut dark, stifling box. He coming alive! A comforting wind blew him. It like live thing putting life him. But his eyelids heavy; he unable open them. All opened themselves. The dome angels come closed round him, bringing room him, taking none away. It blue, filled loveliest white clouds, possessed blowing wind never able blow away. They strangely regular shapes; less alive--piled one other, up--up ever high! They kept places, loveliest blue shadows upon them, glided little. But dome angels rose high, ever higher still, them. The dome angels home, clouds home it. He gazed entranced sight. Then came sudden strong heave roll earthquake, light shone his eyes blinded him. It strong friendly sun. When Clare opened his eyes again, he knew he lying deck one great ships he frequently looked shore. Oh, often he longed one one them, one somewhere, perhaps one, lay something he could without, yet he could never set his eyes, say his hands upon. He his heart's desire, come it? He lay ship, ship lay sea, little world afloat water, moving planet moves heavens, carrying her heaven her, attended her clouds, bearing her whither she would. Up clouds he lay gazing, dome angels, drawing deeper deeper breaths gladness, happy think--when foot came kick ribs, voice ordered get up: he going lie till frigate paid off? Chapter LXIV. The panther. Clare scrambled his feet, surveyed man thus roused him. He vague sense seen before, could remember where. Feeling faint, finding beside gun, he leaned upon it. The sailor regarded insolent look. “Wake up,” he said, “an' come along cap'n. What is service comin' to, I like know, beggarly shaver like cheek stow hisself away board one his majesty's frigates! Wouldn' nothing less suit highness berth Panther?” “Is name ship?” asked Clare. “Yes, that is name ship!” returned man, mimicking him. “You will Panther, his mark, back _you_ presently! Come along, I say, cap'n! We ha' got ask _him_, what is done wi' rascals rob masters, an' stow theirselves away board his majesty's ships!” “Take captain,” said Clare. The man seemed moment doubt whether might mistake: he expected see cringe. But he took collar behind, pushed along quarter-deck, elderly officer pacing alone. “Well, Tom,” said captain, stopping his walk, “what is matter? Who is you have got?” “Please yer honour,” answered boatswain, giving Clare shove, “this here is stowaway his majesty's ship, Panther. I found snug cable-tier.--Salute captain, beggar!” Clare cap lift, he bowed like gentleman he was. The captain stood looking him. Clare returned his gaze, smiled. A sort tremble, much like level air hot summer day, went captain's face, he looked harder Clare. A sound arose like purring enormous cat, and, sure enough, nothing else: chained foot forward binnacle stood panther, dark yellow creature black spots, bigger Pummy, swinging his tail. Clare turned noise he made. The panther made bound leap height length his chain, uttered cry like musical yawn. Clare stretched his arms, staggered toward him. The next moment animal him. The captain darted rescue. But beast licking wherever bare spot lick; Clare wondered find many spots were: he rags! The panther kept tossing he baby, licking he tossed, his vibrating body his whole behaviour manifested exceeding joy. The captain stood staring “like one hath stunned.” The boatswain astonished: he seen Clare home among wild animals, thought panther taken wild-beast smell him. “I beg pardon, sir,” said Clare, rolling panther's reach, rising his feet, “but wild things like me, somehow! I slept puma last night. He panther, sir, would terrible fight met!” The captain threw look disappointment panther. “Go forward, Tom,” he said. The man like turn things taken, he went wore something look one doomed make acquaintance another kind cat. “What made come board ship, lad?” asked captain, voice quiet sounded almost kind. “I come board, sir.” “Do not trifle _me_,” returned captain sternly. Clare looked straight him, said-- “I done nothing wrong, sir. I know help me. I fell asleep last night, I told you, sir, cage puma. I knew him, course! How I came awake board ship, I know do, sir.” The smile Clare's childhood scarcely altered, shone full captain. He turned away, made tack two quarter-deck. He tall, thin man, graceful carriage, little stoop shoulders. He handsome, sad face, growing old. His hair half way gray, he seemed somewhere fifty. He sternness man used command, sternness Clare saw sadness. The attention boy somewhat divided captain his panther, seemed possessed fierce desire get him, though plainly inimical intent. The attention captain seemed divided boy panther; his eyes rested moment animal, turned boy. Two officers port side quarter-deck stole glances strange group--the stately, solemn, still man; ragged creature him, looked his face without fear anxiety, little presumption; wildly excited panther, whose fierce bounding alternated cringing abasement his beautiful person, accompanied loving sweeps his expressive tail. The captain made tack two quarter-deck, turned sharp boy. “What name?” he asked. “I do not quite know, sir,” answered Clare. “Come me,” said captain. To surprise officers, he led way his state-room, boy followed. The panther gave howl Clare disappeared. The officers remarked captain looked strange. His lips compressed vengeance, muscles his face twitching. Chapter LXV. At home. Clare followed, wondering, nowise anxious. He saw nothing make anxious. The captain looked good man, good man friend Clare! But he entered state-room, saw head foot mirror let bulkhead, he startled ashamed: could captain take scarecrow his room! he thought. He reflect sort thing he himself. He indeed felt dirty disreputable, aware dry, rasping tongue panther many patches bare skin, he idea wretched creature he looked. Not one garments he saw mirror his own, disgracefully torn. His hair sticking every way, his face smeared blood. His feet bare, one trouser-leg rent knee. His enemies done best ensure prejudice, frustrate belief. They see his look honest man could misread. Innocent he knew himself, he could help feeling moment disconcerted. But his faithfulness threw mercy man him. The captain turned sat down. The boy stood doorway, staring his reflex self mirror. The captain understood his consternation. “Come along, poor boy,” he said. “How get mess?” “I think I know,” answered Clare, “but I am sure.” “You must drunk,” sighed captain. “Oh, no, sir!” returned Clare, one his radiant smiles. “I have one glass beer life, I did not like it.” The captain smiled too, gazed several moments without speaking. “It seems me,” he said last, he thinking something quite different, “you must want food.” “Oh, no, sir!” answered Clare again, “I am used going without.” Like child sport evil fairy, he boy old wanderings, old, hungry times. But he ever look lost mirror him? he wondered. “You have not told me----” said captain, stopped short, he dreaded going further. “I tell anything want know, sir. Please ask me.” “You say come board frigate: I understand that?” “That I brought, sir, sleep. It would not fair, would it, sir, mention names, I do not know certain brought me? I never knew anything till I opened eyes, thought I in----” He paused. “_Where_ think were?” asked captain eagerly. “In dome angels, sir,” answered Clare. The captain's face fell. He thought innocent, rascals playing practical joke. But made difference! If he simpleton, he might none less be----! Was _her_ boy left to----? He shuddered visibly, silent. “Tell me,” he said length, “what remember.” He meant--of circumstances immediately preceded his coming board Panther; Clare began first thing his memory presented with. Perhaps he yet little dazed. He got single sentence, he saw something earlier wanted telling first; thing happening within first five minutes his narration, sir Harry saw he boy either fertile imagination, “strange, eventful history.” But either supposition difficulty. If, one hand, he tenth part experiences hinted at; if, one thing, he single month tramp, he kept innocent face, angelic smile? If, hand, he making tales, he look sharper? whence angelic smile? Did seeming innocence indicate lack intellect occasionally accompanies remarkable individual gift? He must make begin beginning, tell everything he knew, might pretend know himself! “Stop,” he said. “You told quite know name: call far back remember?” “Clare Porson,” answered boy. At first word captain gave little cry, repressed his emotion, went on. His face white, his breath came went quickly. “Why say _quite_ know name?” “My father mother called name nobody tell real name was.” “Then were not father mother gave name?” “No, sir. I am using till I get own. I shall one day.” “Why think so?” “Do not _you_ think, sir, everything come right one day?” “God grant it!” responded captain groan, self-reproached little faith beside strong desire. “Do think wrong, sir, use name quite own?” said Clare. “People sometimes seem think so.” “Not all, boy! You must name. You steal it. They gave you.” The look boy he thus answered him, completely restored sir Harry's confidence his mental soundness, mode nature his answer every question he put him, bore strongest impress truth. “If boy liar,” he said himself, “I never trust kind. I turn wild-beasts, believe panthers hyenas!” “They did, sir,” answered Clare. “Mr. Porson gave his name, he clergyman. So I thought afterwards, I think it, could not wrong use it.” But could sir Harry palter himself? He might got necessary facts much quicker! Sir Harry shrank seeing his suddenly wakened hope, dead many year, crumble his eyes. He dared yet drive question close. “Did Mr. Porson give names?” he asked. “No, sir. My mother said I brought first me. She said I told them--I do not remember myself--that name Clare.” The captain drove back words threatened break his lips spite him. His boy's name Clarence, his mother, whose dearest friend _Clara_, called her child always _Clare_! “I mean second mother, sir,” explained Clare; “my mother dome angels.” A flash lightened captain's eyes, he seemed gone blind. Clare saw flash, wondered. Again _the dome angels_! The words burst meaning. Out depths world life rose his mind's eye terrible thing made lonely man. Again he stood his head thrown back, looking Assumption Virgin painted awful dome; earthquake seized church, shook painted heaven upon them. He knew more. His little boy standing near him, holding his mother's hand, staring like his father! He force next words his throat. “Where good people gave name find you?” “Sitting mother--my mother. The angels fell her, went again, she got mixed them, went too.” Some people thought friend Skymer “a little queer, know!” I leave reader his thought: he judge his kind. Clare's father longer doubted his perfect faculty. All Clare's life, often old, vague, ever ready vision brought back old feelings, came old thoughts, old forms them, old words attendant shadows; Clare talked like child. The stern, sorrowful man hid his face In his hands. “Grace,” he murmured--and Clare knew somehow he spoke his wife, “we again! We never distrust more!” His frame heaved choking his sobs. Then Clare understood grand man his father. The awe perfect gladness fell upon him. He knelt him, laid his hands together prayer. “Why distrust me, father?” said half-naked outcast. “It child, father I distrusted. I ashamed,” said sir Harry, clasped his arms. The boy laid his blood-stained face his father's bosom, his soul better home sky full angels, home better dome angels, his home his father's heart. How long remained thus I cannot tell. It seemed eternity, eternity would be. When thing be, know eternity eternity. The true is. The father relaxed length arms strained his child his heart. Clare looked white, luminous face. He gazed his father, cried like little Ann, “You are come!” slid his feet. He clasped kissed clung them--would hardly let go. All time officers quarter-deck wondering captain could beggarly stowaway. The panther stood his feet, anxiously waiting, his ears starting every sound. He longing boy he played, panther cub human infant, years long gone by. The sweet airs his childhood panther plainly recognizable accretions disfigured could defile him. The two age. They rolled floor deck together neither could hurt--and neither would. For animal perfectly harmless, chained apt unseasonably frolicsome. When let loose, season high jinks rare skylarking. Then men look out! He twice knocked man overboard, tumbled overboard himself. But he never killed creature, always gentle children, might trusted look infant. Sir Harry raised his son, kissed him, set his chair, retired inner cabin. A knock came door. Clare said, “Come in.” The quartermaster entered. Instead sir Harry, he saw miserable stowaway, seated captain's chair. He swore him, ordered out, prepared give kick he passed. “Out you!” he cried. “Go for'ard. Tell bo's'n look rope's end. I will you.” “The captain told sit here,” answered Clare, sat. The officer looked closer him, begged his pardon, saluted, withdrew. The father heard, said himself, “The boy gentleman: he knows take his orders.” He called inner cabin, washed head foot, rejoicing find his rags skin clean his own. “Now clothes, Clare?” said sir Harry. “Perhaps somebody would lend some,” answered Clare. “May not I cabin-boy, father? You let sailor, will not you, sail always you?” “You shall sailor, boy,” answered sir Harry, “and sail long God pleases. You know obey orders!” “I obey cook tell me, father.” “You shall obey nobody myself,” returned sir Harry; “--and lord high admiral,” he added, glance upward, smile like his son's. For day Clare kept captain's state-room; next, he went deck midshipman's uniform, he wore like gentleman could obey orders. Chapter LXVI. The end Clare Skymer's boyhood. His father hammock slung state-room; he could parted even slept. One night sir Harry, lying awake, heard movement state-room, got up. It still, star-lit night. The frigate dreaming away northward sail set. Through windows shone level stars. From beam hung dim lamp. He could see one. He went hammock. There boy it. Then he spied him, kneeling stern-windows, his head down. “Anything matter, Clare?” he asked. “No, father.” “What doing?” “Trying say _Thank father!_” “Oh, thank him, thank him, boy!” returned sir Harry. “Thank heart. He give us _her_ day!” “Yes, father, he will!” responded Clare. His father knelt beside him, neither said word heard. The next night, Clare quarter-deck his father, heard give certain orders officers watch. He never heard orders given way: he spoke quietly, directly, simply! The night gusty dark, threatening foul weather. The captain measured quarter-deck first Clare saw him, mien different! He walked slow stately before, look almost triumph his eyes, glancing often clouds. The thought father made Clare tremble delight head foot. His father power sea-planet bore them! Him great vessel, aboard her, obeyed! He life her motions, soul her! At his pleasure she bowed her obedient head, swept seas! Clare's heart swelled within him. But father had, night before, knelt presence one unseen, worshipping thanking higher himself! As captain Panther sailed his frigate seas, great father, father his father, father fathers, captain kneeled little child, sailed heaven heavens huge ship world, guided fleet upon fleet innumerable trackless space! And infinitely grander sea measureless ocean worlds, Father carrying navies human souls, every soul world whose affairs none Father could understand, many storm, waterspout, battle powers evil, safe children, Father's house! And Clare began understand was. One day his father said him-- “Clare, whatever forget, whatever remember, mind this--that I mother children one father, three good children father. If he tells us, he bring us length port. Our admiral Jesus Christ. We take orders him. But sail his ship.” The boatswain shook his wide shoes, Clare never showed least disfavour. He recognized two officers he seen menagerie, beyond giving look he could hardly mistake, he showed sign knowledge them. He set sailor, learned fast. I need scarcely say he precise obeying superior officer best sailor board. In weeks he felt looked manner born--as indeed he was, his father, his grandfather, his great-grandfather, yet his ancestors,--how many I know, sailors. He rough shaking. The earthquake come gone, come gone many times. But shaking earth his nurse, she taught dwell world cannot shaken. [Illustration: Clare proceeds untie ropes ring bull's nose.]
